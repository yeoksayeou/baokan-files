### Minor Skirmishes on the Kunshan-Taicang Front, Confused Fighting in the Suburbs of Jiashan, Fierce Fighting South of Chong'an in Northern Fujian

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] According to a military communique released at 9:30 PM on May 11th:

(1) On the Kunshan-Taicang front, there have only been sporadic battles in recent days, with our troops achieving considerable gains. In the area west of the Kunshan railway, small groups of bandits harassed us at noon on the 11th, but were repelled by our champion troops. Our troops, remaining behind enemy lines, are gradually growing and becoming more active with the assistance of local civilians, posing a significant threat to the enemy's rear.

(2) The bandits advancing towards Jiashan are still engaged in confused fighting with our troops in the suburbs. Another force of over two thousand is circling around to attack Fengjing Town, and we have dispatched troops to suppress them.

(3) Transportation on the Songjiang-Jinshan route is smooth, and the market is peaceful. The troops stationed there and the residents all share a determination to fight the bandits to the end. If the bandits dare to invade, they will surely suffer a crushing defeat.

(4) A portion of the bandits and local communists from Haiyan, numbering about 400, attempted to attack Mojia Village this morning. Our defending troops launched a head-on attack, killing or wounding over 50 bandits and capturing 5. The rest fled in disarray.

(5) About 500 to 600 local communists were discovered in the area 3-4 li south of Shangyu on the morning of the 11th. A certain unit of our army has dispatched troops to search and suppress them.

(6) A certain main force of the bandits, together with a battalion of artillery, fled south towards Chong'an (located at the border of Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, within Fujian territory) last night. A certain unit of our army bravely engaged them, inflicting fierce and continuous attacks, killing or wounding over 400 bandits. The bandits then continued their fierce attack using superior artillery fire, resulting in intense fighting. Currently, our defending troops are strongly resisting in the area east and west of Xing'an, firmly holding their original positions.

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Military news at 11:00 AM on May 11th:

(1) A certain main force of bandits harassing Jiaxing, under cover of artillery fire last night, launched a fierce attack on the northwestern suburbs of Jiashan. Our defending troops calmly responded to the attack, and the bandits' repeated attempts to charge were repelled. The battle was extremely fierce, continuing until dawn. Due to the destruction of communications lines, contact has been lost.

(2) Over 2,000 bandits infiltrated from Yingtan towards the Jinxi-Nancheng area yesterday morning (May 10th). A certain unit of our army is currently intercepting them.

[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, May 11th Dispatch] The Central News Agency's Shanghai dispatch on the 9th reported fierce fighting in Fengling, northern Fujian. However, according to local authorities here, that report is inaccurate. It is reported that on the 5th, Zhejiang bandits appeared to be heading south across the Xianxia Ridge, but under the close surveillance of the national army, they fled back on the 8th, and no fighting occurred. The situation in Fujian is currently peaceful, and local communists have little room for activity under the surveillance of the powerful national army.

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, May 11th Dispatch] Military News: (1) Communist activities have been detected at the Jiaoqiao bridge between Zhangshu and Linchuan. (2) In the Echang area, bandit activities have been detected in the Xujiabu and Liujiadu areas. The national army is closely monitoring the situation.

### After a Crushing Defeat of the Communist Army in Jiaodong, Qingdao's Outskirts Return to Calm

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, May 11th Dispatch] The communist field army in Jiaodong suffered a crushing defeat and has been largely annihilated, with no capacity to attack again.

### "People's Government" Established in Nanjing

### Fu Bingchang Lectures in Hong Kong on the Recent Situation in the Soviet Union

[United Press, Hong Kong, May 11th Dispatch] According to reports, Fu Bingchang, the Chinese ambassador to the Soviet Union, gave a lecture at the University of Hong Kong on the 11th, reporting on the recent situation in the Soviet Union. He claimed that religious freedom in the Soviet Union is gradually being restored. The change in the Soviet Union's attitude towards religion is the result of Soviet military families praying for the safety of their expeditionary forces during the war. Divorce cases in the Soviet Union have also decreased compared to before the war, which is the effect of implementing new divorce laws. The purpose of these laws is to stabilize families, as many Soviets serving abroad are easily attracted to foreign women and want to divorce their wives back home.

### Foreign Merchants Disappointed in Trade with the Communist Areas

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, May 11th Dispatch] Steel, a Far East correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune, wrote an article from Seoul, which was published in the Jiji Shinpo here. The article stated: The foreign trade implemented by the Chinese Communists in Northeast and North China has set China back a hundred years. The strict and unreasonable control of trade and foreign exchange by the Chinese Communists has disappointed many foreign merchants, as they had expected the Chinese Communists to conduct fair trade. Most foreign trading firms in Tianjin and Beijing are pessimistic about future trade under the Chinese Communist regime. The Chinese Communists' interference in foreign trade is extremely bureaucratic and unreasonable, and the procedures are even more cumbersome than those of the Chinese government. Over 60% of foreign trade is monopolized by the North China Trade Bureau, so there is no room for activity for ordinary merchants. Large-scale private industries in North China, such as coal mines, are currently facing increasing operational difficulties due to labor problems and the Communist side's arbitrary interference in management and finance. Under Communist rule, there is no distinction between Chinese and foreign or Soviet and Anglo-American firms. However, the Chinese Communists are particularly harsh on American firms in North China, and their situation is very difficult. British banks in North China have been allowed to continue operating, but although half of foreign commerce and trade in North China belongs to the United States, American banks have been closed.

### Ambassador Gu Weijun Meets with Acheson

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Washington, May 11th Broadcast: After meeting with Acheson for half an hour, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States told reporters: He had requested that Acheson consider the United States joining a Pacific regional treaty similar to the Atlantic Pact, in order to clearly demonstrate to the enemies of democracy that the United States is as concerned about the progress of communism in Asia as it is elsewhere.

### Hong Kong Continues to Strengthen its Defense Forces; Planes Fly to Hong Kong from Singapore Today; British Government Officials Believe the Chinese Communists Are Unlikely to Attack Hong Kong

[Reuters, Manila, May 10th Dispatch] It has been officially announced here: A Royal Air Force squadron, consisting of fifteen land-based aircraft and one Sunderland flying boat, will arrive here on the 12th from Singapore, en route to Hong Kong for routine practice flights.

[Reuters, Hong Kong, May 11th Dispatch] Reliable sources report: British army units will soon begin regular patrols in the 350-square-mile area of Kowloon, opposite Hong Kong Island. The British Field Artillery Regiment and the Gurkha Infantry Battalion stationed there will also be reinforced.

[Agence France-Presse, Canberra, May 10th Dispatch] The Australian government recently stated that if Hong Kong were threatened and requested assistance, the Australian government would immediately give it attention. However, the same source said that Australia would not take the initiative on this issue. They pointed out that Prime Minister Chifley had said that Australia had not yet received any requests from Britain to reinforce Hong Kong.

[United Press, London, May 10th Dispatch] Well-informed sources claimed on the 10th that although the Chinese Communist troops are gradually approaching Hong Kong, the British government does not expect the Chinese Communists to launch any large-scale attack on Hong Kong. The British side acknowledges that the main danger to Hong Kong is the possibility of internal disturbances launched by "rebels," so precautionary measures have been taken to reinforce the British garrison in Hong Kong.

An official said, "There is no question that 6,000 British troops will continue to be stationed in Hong Kong. With reinforcements, the garrison is expected to defend the colony against any large-scale military attack, but we have no reason to expect Hong Kong to suffer a large-scale military attack." The official also said that there is currently no plan to evacuate women and children from Hong Kong, as was done when the Japanese army massed on the Hong Kong border in 1940.

Colonel Kirk, the former commander of the British Army Engineer Corps stationed in China before the war, recently criticized the British Cabinet's decision to reinforce Hong Kong, saying that a garrison of 6,000 in Hong Kong is "absolutely insufficient." The perimeter of Hong Kong Island alone is 25 miles, and the coastline of the leased territory opposite Hong Kong Island is 100 miles. Among the 6,000 British troops, each soldier must defend more than 1,000 yards of coastline against a potentially powerful communist army.

Regarding the naval perspective, Colonel Bell, who once served in China, said that the defense of Hong Kong is primarily a naval matter. Without aircraft carriers, effective defense is impossible. Without air support, the colony is bound to fall. Only aircraft carriers can provide air support. And if aircraft carriers are based in the Mediterranean, they will be of little use to Hong Kong.

### It Is Not Too Late to Prevent the Chinese Communist Advance

Zhou Yide Said in New York

[United Press, New York, May 11th Dispatch] Republican Congressman Zhou Yide said in a speech at a religious gathering on the night of the 11th that it is not too late for the United States to try to stop the advance of communism.

### The Garrison Troops Outside Hankou Launch an Attack, and Local Communists 20 Li Northeast of the City Are Repelled

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, May 11th Dispatch] Military News: The garrison troops outside Hankou, in coordination with heavy artillery, launched attacks on Caidian, Zhangjiawan, Jimakou and other places, and were very successful. They are currently continuing their advance. Furthermore, in recent days, our Air Force has flown to Qijiawan, north of Hankou, to bomb the Communist troops, with excellent results.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, May 11th Dispatch] The Wuhan defense battle has entered its third day. From morning to night, the sound of artillery is loud and clear, and the citizens are quite panicked. Most of the shops in the city are closed, the streets are heavily guarded by police, and the number of pedestrians has decreased sharply, as no one knows where the sound of artillery is coming from. The sound of artillery gradually subsided at 8:00 PM. The reporter visited a senior military official, who said: There are 6,000 local Communists active more than 20 li northeast of Hankou. They were engaged by the national army, with the assistance of heavy artillery. The Communist army was unable to withstand the attack and was forced to retreat more than 2 li to the north. The national army is currently continuing its mop-up operation. Please tell the citizens that the artillery fire is coming from the national army's position and that there is no need to panic.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, May 11th Dispatch] May 11th was the third day of the Wuhan defense battle. Commander Lu Daoyuan specially ordered the Wuhan outer garrison to attack the bandits at Sandaoqiao, with the assistance of the Air Force. The battle was extremely fierce. From 2:00 PM onwards, the sound of artillery fire could be heard in Wuhan, and passersby rushed to flee. Shops closed one after another, and the city was in a desolate state. The reporter made a special trip to visit Huang Shengyuan, a spokesman for the Wuhan Garrison Command, who said: This battle was an active attack by our army, and the sound of artillery fire was fired by our side. The bandits at Sandaoqiao have collapsed towards Zhangkou. At the same time, another unit of our army attacked more than 2,000 bandits from Xiaji to Lijia岗 and Xujiawan, successively capturing Lijia岗 and Xujiawan and other places, killing more than 400 bandits, seizing 3 machine guns and more than 80 rifles. We lost a platoon leader and 57 soldiers. On the night of the 10th, our army conducted a mop-up operation near Cai Dian Banji in Hanyang, and the bandits have been forced to retreat. Our army is chasing after them.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, May 10th Dispatch] Today is the third day of the Wuhan defense battle. There was artillery fire in Chenjiaji, Niejiang, and Fenghuo Mountain in the northern suburbs. The sound of artillery fire could be heard clearly in the city around 1:00 PM, but the general public remained calm.

### Reliable Sources in Guangzhou Report That Fu Zuoyi Has Committed Suicide After Attempting to Flee to National Army Area Without Success

[United Press, Guangzhou, May 11th Dispatch] According to reliable sources today: Former North China military leader Fu Zuoyi committed suicide yesterday. Mr. Fu attempted to flee to the National Army area without success, and was forced to do so by Communist leaders. This is the result of months of disputes between Mr. Fu and the Communist military headquarters. The Communist authorities demanded that the troops of Mr. Fu be incorporated into the Communist army.

### The British Embassy Remains in Nanjing, and London's Public Opinion Criticizes "Throwing Dust Into Their Own Eyes"

[Agence France-Presse, London, May 10th Dispatch] "The Economist" magazine today published an article commenting on the situation in China, with the title "The Ambiguous Embassy in China." The article stated, "The Chinese Communists have re-demanded over the Beijing radio that British warships apologize for their violent actions and compensate for the losses. But under these favorable conditions, even if both sides in China may adopt a friendly diplomatic policy towards Britain, we will still consider it carefully. International law makes it impossible for us to quickly recognize a rebel party diplomatically while a government recognized by all countries still retains a large part of the country. Moreover, these two sides are not equally friendly. One side has a history of maintaining reasonable friendly relations with Western countries, while the other side has declared that it will be an ally of the Soviet Union in any war caused by the Atlantic Pact. It would be unwise to sacrifice a most dissatisfied friend and bestow the benefits of diplomatic recognition on the enemy. And some say that the British ambassador's stay in Nanjing is to conduct private contact with the Chinese Communists to obtain the release of the Amethyst. But having envoys with both sides at the same time does not solve the most important problem: which government has the right to use the foreign assets of the Chinese government? Which government has the right to appoint ambassadors to various countries, as well as representatives to the United Nations, representatives to the Allied Control Council in Tokyo, or Chinese consuls in various parts of Southeast Asia? We must add this power to one of the two parties. If the British ambassador to China consults with the Chinese Communist authorities, while at the same time sending a lower-level representative to Guangzhou, it is tantamount to placing the Chinese Communists in a higher position than the National Government. If this is the case, what attitude will the British government take when the Chinese Communists demand to send another ambassador to Britain, or use China's pound deposits in Britain? The American side's attempt to recall its ambassador is to avoid this dilemma. Just as they were able to avoid the losses suffered by the British Navy by withdrawing warships from the Yangtze River in advance, the American policy towards China is to 'wait until the dust settles,' while the British policy is to throw dust into their own eyes.

### Improvement of the Method of Issuing Meal Allowances for Students in Various Schools

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, May 11th Dispatch] Zhan Jiewu, spokesman for the Ministry of Education, recently told reporters about the situation of issuing meal allowances for students in various schools, saying: For students' meal allowances in various schools, all those approved on file are issued by the Ministry in accordance with the methods approved by the Executive Yuan. The standard is 2.3 dou of rice per student per month, and the payment is made according to the market price. The non-staple food cost is adjusted monthly according to the base number of 10 yuan multiplied by the cost of living index. This fund is advanced every month. For example, the student meal allowance for May will be advanced at the beginning of this month according to the number for last month, so that the schools can purchase grain in advance and will not be affected by the increase in rice prices. If the price of rice rises sharply in the middle of the month, additional advances will still be added successively. From May onwards, it is planned to uniformly change the staple and non-staple food costs to be calculated in customs gold units. This is being discussed with the Ministry of Budget and Finance. Zhan also said: The Ministry hopes that the principals of various schools will be responsible for supervising the students' meals, and after receiving the Ministry's payment, they will purchase grain for the entire month to avoid being affected by price fluctuations.

### The Arrival of 30,000 Japanese Troops in Guangzhou Is Pure Fabrication

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, May 11th Dispatch] Government spokesman Bao Jingan claimed: Today, a certain newspaper in Hong Kong reported that 30,000 Japanese troops had arrived in Guangzhou, which is completely fabricated. There are many citizens in Guangzhou. If 30,000 Japanese troops had arrived, it should have spread throughout the city. Why is it that no Guangzhou newspapers have this news, and the people of Guangzhou are not aware of this? The government, in fact, cannot completely hide such a large number of troops. This proves the absurdity of this news.

### Long Wenzhi Died in Guangzhou

Collapsed and Died on the Way to Visit Friends

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, May 11th Dispatch] Legislative Yuan member Long Wenzhi arrived in Guangzhou from Chongqing at 1:30 PM on the afternoon of the 10th.

[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, May 11th Dispatch] The rice shortage for Fuzhou residents has been resolved. Rice boats from upstream have been pouring in in recent days. The price per stone has returned to the old price of one qian and two fen and five li half a month ago, lower than the city government's limit price of one qian and three fen. However, commodity prices have risen sharply in recent days due to the instability of people's minds. On the 11th, each Yuan Yang coin was worth 7.5 million, and the prices of various goods rose by 60%.

### Hong Kong to Adopt Silver Standard? Morse Denies It

[United Press, Hong Kong, May 11th Dispatch] Morse, manager of HSBC, said on the 11th that the claim in a certain Shanghai newspaper that Hong Kong might adopt the silver standard is pure fabrication. He also heard rumors of silver being shipped to South China, but no silver has come to Hong Kong.

He will also invite Jiang Menglin, Li Shuhua, Zhu Jia骅, Wang Shijie, Chen Lifu, Mei Yiqi, and Chen Xueping and others to discuss and study them in late this month, so as to serve as the basis for future educational measures.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, May 11th Dispatch] The Ministry of Education recently sent telegrams to national universities and colleges in Guangdong, Guangzhou, Jiangxi, Fujian and other regions, stating that due to the recent instability of the situation, teaching in various universities and colleges should be intensified, and the end of the semester may be advanced as appropriate.

### Northwest Journey

— Chen Xiangmei

On April 1st, I took a plane from Guangzhou to the Northwest.

Along the way, I passed through Chongqing, then Hanzhong, and entered Lanzhou. Then I went to Ningxia. After returning from Ningxia, I flew back to Lanzhou and then to Xining, Qinghai. The whole journey was thousands of miles, lasting a week. On the evening of the 8th, I returned to Guangzhou, where every household was lit with lights, already in the twilight hours.

This trip was very interesting, and I saw many places and people I had never seen before. If the South is delicate, then the Northwest is magnificent. The graceful women of the South sing "Willows on the bank, a fading moon in the dawn breeze." The North is like a towering man singing "The great river flows eastward."

Chongqing:

Three thousand miles of the Jialing Shu Road,
Everywhere cold mountains, the thrush cries.

In the mountain city of March, spring is almost over. It happened to be a day without fog. It took more than an hour to drive into the city from Baishiyi. Along the way, there were thousands of mountains and ridges. Most of the air-raid shelters from the war years have been sealed off with wooden fences, and a few of them are inhabited.

Passing the Jialing River, the water was very shallow as it was low tide. Seeing the river, it's easy to recall Chongqing during the war. How lively this mountain city was at that time! Now everything is silent, like the beach after the tide has receded.

In the evening, I stayed at the Lizhi Society, a delicate three-story Western-style building. The bathroom facilities were much better than in Guangzhou, although there was no hot water, the cold water was continuous. However, the poor electricity was comparable to the "ghost lights" of Guangzhou.

People who have lived in Chongqing probably never forget the rats of Chongqing. Sichuan rats can be said to be unmatched in the world. At night, the rat leader strutted around the room, as if he was inspecting the troops without a commander. Others came and went freely in the room, with no one in their eyes, which also made you marvel.

The rickshaws in Chongqing are still as dilapidated as before, perhaps even more so. The weather in Chongqing is still as gloomy as ever. The only difference is that Chongqing is not as lively as it used to be.

Seeing Chongqing again makes me miss the days of the War of Resistance. It seems to have been at least a little better than now. If that's the case, when will the good days we are waiting for and hoping for come?

Lanzhou:

After staying in Chongqing for two days, I flew to Lanzhou on April 3rd.

Lanzhou is the capital of Gansu Province, and the Chairman of Gansu Province, Guo Jiqi, is stationed here. When we arrived, we were warmly received by Chairman Guo and his wife. We stayed at Chengqingguan, in a room where President Chiang and his wife, Wallace (we don't want to be associated with Wallace, we hereby declare), Willkie, Marshall, and British Ambassador Stephen had stayed during the war. The architecture is very modern, and the garden has pavilions and towers. Behind the house is a building called Wanghe Tower, from which you can see the rolling Yellow River, flowing continuously. As the Tang poem says, "The Yellow River rises far beyond the white clouds, a thousand miles of Jiangling, ten thousand fathoms of mountains. Why should the Qiang flute complain about the willows? The spring breeze does not reach the Jade Gate Pass."

Gansu Province is the gateway to the Northwest. To enter the Northwest, you must pass through Gansu. In ancient times, it was a strategic location for military strategists. Now, with the progress of the times, its position is becoming increasingly important. Chairman Guo stationed troops here, and his mission is self-evident.

In the evening, Chairman Guo hosted a banquet, serving wine that is said to be a specialty of Lanzhou. It is fragrant and mellow, and easy to get drunk. There was a dance party, and all the music broadcast on the radio was American. It was hard to believe that I was in Lanzhou.

It is said that the weather in Lanzhou is very cool in summer, making it an ideal place to escape the heat. Moreover, there are no mosquitoes. At that time, the leaves are green and the flowers are red, and various fruits are on the market. Chairman Guo said that he must invite us to spend the summer there.

Ningxia:

On the 4th, I arrived in Ningxia, which is also the authentic Northwest.

The plane flew along the Yellow River, and the mountains and rivers were all earthy yellow, and the houses gradually became sparse. We knew we had reached the authentic Northwest.

The Chairman of Ningxia Province, Ma Hongkui, and his wife personally came to the airport to greet us. I had long heard of Chairman Ma and his wife. Their every word, every smile, and every action were truly like their reputation. Chairman Ma is currently suffering from severe diabetes and his weight is increasing, so walking is very inconvenient. Madame Ma is suffering from early-stage polio, and her steps are also difficult. We felt very sorry that we made them come to greet us in person.

The house we stayed in was arranged by Madame Ma, who got out of bed despite her illness and spent three days and three nights. There were French sofa beds, New York decorations, and what I considered a miracle was that there was hot and cold running water and neon lights. Madame Ma also burned incense, raised red plums, brewed fragrant tea from Beiping, hung a brazier, and hung embroidered curtains in our bedroom. Secretary Shu Boyan said as soon as he entered the room: "This is a palace!" Yes, this is a palace, let us have an emperor's dream tonight.

Chairman Ma led his troops to Ningxia in the spring of the 22nd year (of the Republic) and it has been almost twenty years. At the beginning of his tenure, the people were poor, the treasury was empty, and the villages were uneasy. But after he cleared the land, reorganized finance, promoted the Baojia system, water conservancy, tree planting, and loans to farmers, this poor area has gradually made progress. Chairman Ma's army has also spared no effort in suppressing bandits. In the winter of the 36th year, he sent troops to relieve the siege of Yulin, defeating Peng Dehuai's main force. Now, in the midst of the voices of defending the Northwest, his aim remains consistent.

In order to make General Chen understand the defense of the Northwest, on the second day after our arrival in Ningxia, Chairman Ma summoned more than 10,000 troops for General Chen to review, including cavalry, infantry, and artillery. On that vast parade ground, yellow dust billowed, and more than 10,000 officers and soldiers performed various exercises, which was a magnificent sight.

Helan Mountain. Everyone in Ningxia Province never forgets Yue Fei's heroic words, "Driving a long chariot, trampling on the Que of Helan Mountain; with the ambition to eat the flesh of the barbarians when hungry, laughing and talking and drinking the blood of the Xiongnu when thirsty!"

The people of the Northwest are all determined to fight the communists. Most of them are Muslims and are irreconcilable with communism. The Northwest is now preparing for joint defense. Chairman Ma said that as long as he is alive, he will not allow Ningxia to become communist. Even if he dies, there are his sons and grandsons, and they will resist to the end.

Qinghai:

The traveler's sentinel drum is dark in the wind and sand, and the princess's pipa is full of melancholy. Camping for thousands of miles without city walls, rain and snow fall one after another, connecting the vast desert. — Li Qi —

The wind and sand in Qinghai are so strong, the men of Qinghai are so strong, the horses of Qinghai are so good, the mutton of Qinghai is so fragrant, and the girls there are also very beautiful. This is our impression of Qinghai.

Driving from the airport to the city, my hair turned from black to gray because the wind and sand blew in my face along the way, making it difficult to open my eyes. The trees on the plateau have not yet turned green or blossomed. Three or five sheep graze on the ridges, countless horses, the land is vast and the sky is long, the yellow desert is desolate, a picture of the severe winter in the Northwest.

Chairman Ma Bufang is not only a capable leader, but also a sincere Muslim. His only son, Ma Jiyuan, is now leading 40,000 to 50,000 troops stationed at the junction of Gansu and Qinghai. Last year, he defeated the Red Bandits in the Pingliang battle, and his reputation was greatly enhanced. It is said that the communists retreat without a fight when they see the broadsword team he leads. Many American reporters have visited him on the front line, calling him a Muslim hero.

Chairman Ma has achieved great results in governing Qinghai. His performance in the military and political aspects can be seen locally, and even more achievements have been made in education. We visited two schools and were very satisfied with both. There is a kindergarten in Xining City with more than 1,400 students. There are two middle schools and a women's normal school. In the evening, Chairman Ma invited us to attend a welcome meeting for the students, where the students gave various performances. From the students' performances, we can see that the education and training they receive is mainly to protect their homeland and Qinghai. The programs include "Four Degrees of Yumen Pass" and "Unity is Strength," which are all very meaningful themes.

Muslims eat only mutton, boiled, roasted, or stewed. Among them, roasted mutton is the most delicious. Rice is scarce, and there is more flour. Lotus seeds and tea are both delicacies. If the people there treat you with lotus seed soup, that is the most remarkable thing. It is said that a bowl of lotus seeds is equal to a table of wine and dishes, believe it or not.

It is worth mentioning the public security in Qinghai Province. There, I did not see a single policeman, and there were no guards at the city gates. People came and went freely, but there were no bandits or communists, and there was no curfew at night. This inner peace is not easy to find in China today.

The people of Qinghai are very simple and honest. However, they are capable warriors and they are not afraid of death. Muslim women do not seem to have much status, but it is much better than before. I saw many girls with red faces walking on the road. They used to be confined to their homes, but now they are allowed to go out.

The impression the Northwest gave me was deep, majestic, and bright. The mountains and rivers there are grand, and the people there are hardworking. The Yellow River flows through the undulating land, flowing non-stop, flooding every year, bringing endless pain to the people. Ah, this is the sigh of the earth!

However, the Northwest also has many treasures, waiting for us to develop. There are virgin lands, which have been lying quietly for many years, allowing the desert storm to cover them, unheard of.

The Northwest is vast and sparsely populated. In addition, because it has not received assistance from the central government for decades, the people are still inevitably poor despite their continuous efforts. Now the position of the Northwest is becoming increasingly important. What a great land, how should we cherish it!

### Editorial: The Principles of Issuing Local Currency

The issuance of the Gold Yuan Certificate has never been separated from finance, which destined it to a tragic fate; and it has also led to today's economic recession, financial disorder, and fiscal difficulties. This phenomenon has a significant impact on financial planning, but it is even more profound in harming local people's livelihood. In recent times, local governments and public opinion institutions have felt the pressure of inflation, which is becoming heavier and heavier. In order to save the financial and economic crisis, they have proposed the issuance of local currency and have already put it into practice. Although the central authorities have expressed dissatisfaction with this move, they are unable to take action to stop it due to the unsoundness of the Gold Yuan Certificate itself.

In a wide range of areas across the country, except for Taiwan, which has special circumstances, and the areas occupied by the Communist army, there is almost no place without its own independent currency. For example, the Central Bank will issue silver dollar certificates in South China, Yunnan has issued semi-open silver dollar certificates, and Fujian, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces have issued silver dollar subsidiary currency certificates. Guizhou is also preparing to issue "provincial currency". Xinjiang, Sichuan, and Xikang provinces are also brewing to issue silver dollar certificates. The area where the Gold Yuan Certificate is actually used can be said to be only Shanghai. Therefore, the loss of inflation is also borne by a small number of people in Shanghai. Although Shanghai has always been a rich area in the country, from the perspective of the principle of fairness in fiscal burden, this is really inappropriate. What's more, among the general classes in this city, public utilities have a unique "pricing index", postal and telecommunications have self-defined "postal and telecommunications units", aviation, railways, and waterways all charge fees based on silver dollars, the Customs charges import goods with "Customs Yuan", and the National Taxation Bureau calculates the finished products of factories with "Tax Yuan". They have all cleverly avoided the loss of inflation. May I ask who bears this loss?

The people of Shanghai are in such a bad environment and must quickly find a way out in order to resist the violence of currency and maintain the prosperity of industry and commerce. At the end of last month, Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Yan Esheng, representative of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, suggested at the municipal government's reception that commercial banks in the city should deposit reserves and issue Shanghai local currency. It was reported that Mayor Chen immediately supported the proposal. However, the above-mentioned local currency has not yet had a concrete plan to this day, and there has been no response from all parties, which really makes us extremely depressed. We deeply hope that all parties concerned will continue to work hard to realize it as soon as possible, and save the people from suffering.

In order to give full play to the use of local currency, it is necessary to be particularly cautious beforehand. Here, we believe that the following principles must be observed:

First, it should be recognized that the issuance of local currency is for purely economic needs and should not be subject to the pressure of military expenditures in fiscal expansion, and the issuance should not be excessive.

Second, sufficient cash reserves must be prepared for the people to redeem at any time, and to lay the most basic credit.

Third, the issuing institution must be independent. It must not be presided over by the Central Bank or the Municipal Bank. It is best to entrust the joint issuance of several larger commercial banks in the city to avoid being constrained by military and political expenses.

If the local currency can strictly observe these principles, and the preparation is sufficient and the redemption is sufficient, then the chips issued, no matter what paper money, can win the trust of the society. As for the technical details, such as preparing sufficient subsidiary coins, the procedures for the acting redemption bank, and the legal ratio with the Gold Yuan, etc., can be left to the issuing institution to discuss.

Whether the local currency issued in Shanghai can still circulate is a question that cannot be ignored. At present, some people believe that if the Gold Yuan Certificate is still allowed to circulate in the market, not only will the people's living standards be greatly affected, but also the currency chips will be extraordinarily increased, forming a greater expansion of currency. This concern has its necessity in theory, but in terms of facts, if the central government does not object to the issuance of local currency in this city, then it is clear that the burden of loss due to currency depreciation in this city has been reduced. Even if it continues to be harmed, it must be relatively mild. Furthermore, there are many central military and political agencies in Shanghai, and where will all the salaries and supplies come from if the central government does not provide them with Gold Yuan Certificates? Therefore, our compromise view on the above question is that we may allow the Gold Yuan Certificate and local currency to circulate at the same time, but in fact, after a considerable period of time, the Gold Yuan Certificate will inevitably be ruthlessly eliminated with the natural trend of the economy.

### Visitors from Suzhou Talk About the Wind and Rain; The First Step After the District Army Entered the City Was to Ask for Comfort Items; Industry and Commerce Have No Business and Will All Close Down

[Report from this newspaper] A visitor came from Suzhou, detailing the situation before and after the city changed hands.

It is said that on the night of April 26th, the main force of the defending army had withdrawn eastward, leaving only a few rearguard troops in the Fengqiao area. On the morning of the 27th, after a small contact, the Communist army entered Panmen. At that time, all the shops in the area were closed. However, after entering, the Communist army knocked on each door, instructing them to open for business as usual. During the emergency period, a business group was temporarily formed in the urban area to defend against petty thefts, so order was maintained throughout, and shops and residents did not suffer losses.

Uninvited Guests Live in People's Homes

Most of the Communist army that entered Suzhou City marched quickly through the urban area and headed towards Sujia Road via Xiangmen. The rest stayed in the city, generally dispersed and stayed in people's homes. Those who lived in houses with large houses and few people were visited by these uninvited guests, in groups of three or five, and the homeowners dared to be angry but dared not speak out.

After the Communist army entered the city, they issued a notice changing Suzhou to a city, appointing Hui Yuzi and Wu Ming as mayor and deputy mayor, and establishing a Military Control Commission, with Wei Guoqing as the chairman. The first step after entering the city was to summon representatives of the Chamber of Commerce and request a batch of comfort items, including 3,000 packs of cigarettes, 3,000 dozen socks, 10,000 dans of rice, and 5,000 silver dollars. It was also decided to borrow 40% of the annual grain production from the landlords.

Receivers Are Ignorant

This time, the retreat of the Nationalist army in Jiangnan was beyond the expectations of the Communist army, so they admitted that they were completely unprepared for all the reception work. The receivers were very young, generally around 20 years old, both men and women. Most of them had a middle school education, and they were ignorant of the business situation of the receiving agencies. The complexity of financial institutions made them even more helpless. According to those who were involved, it was estimated that it would take at least three months to complete the reception work at the current speed. When the manager of the Suzhou branch of the "People's Bank" first summoned representatives of the banks to talk, he was wearing a soldier's uniform, which surprised everyone present.

There was also no overall plan for the currency exchange beforehand.

People's Currency Also Devalued

There are no regulations on the redemption of Gold Yuan Certificates. However, the value of the People's Currency is also constantly falling. Initially, it was stipulated that one silver dollar could be exchanged for 400 yuan of People's Currency, but after five days, the black market rose to 740 yuan. The price of gold also rose accordingly, and people's lives were difficult. The price of rice once rose to nine silver dollars per dan, pork was about three catties per yuan, and vegetable prices also soared. The people said, "Each crab is worse than the last."

As far as industry and commerce as a whole are concerned, they have entered a state of stagnation. Although shops reluctantly open, customers are few and far between. Business people predict that if the situation does not change, they will all close down within a month or two. The banks that specialize in high-interest speculation on weekdays are even facing desperation. The Military Control Commission is currently investigating the equity situation of various banks, threatening that if it is found that there is bureaucratic capital involved, it will be confiscated.

Private Life Temporarily Left Alone

Interference in people's private lives has not yet begun. The main reason is that political workers have not yet arrived in large numbers, and the number of those who have arrived is too small. They are busy with other reception work, and they clearly have no time to manage this. However, the Military Control Commission has indeed transferred a batch of local cadres from northern Jiangsu to Suzhou to serve as district chiefs and town chiefs. At that time, people's free lives may come to an end.

### Eve of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference: Acheson Clarifies Stance; List of US Delegation Announced; Jessup and Bohlen Fly to Paris Today

[Report from this newspaper] Washington, November 11 Broadcast: US Secretary of State Acheson stated at a press conference that whether the East and West can reach an agreement at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference depends on whether the Soviet Union is willing to support the Western countries in integrating Germany into a peaceful European group. Acheson also stated: US policy is to unify Germany and ensure that all people enjoy basic civil rights. The United States does not intend to accept any proposal for a unified Germany that cannot guarantee these basic rights. Acheson praised the West German leaders for drafting the German federal constitution with satisfactory results.

[Reuters, London, October 10] A London reporter for the "New York Times" reported that after the Soviet Foreign Minister's visit to Germany, he immediately began preparing for the district foreign ministers conference to be held in Paris on May 23. Some people still express doubts about the results of this conference. They believe that unless the Soviet Union completely changes its attitude held at the previous foreign ministers' conference, the Paris conference cannot be expected to achieve any success. As far as the three countries of Britain, the United States, and France are concerned, they all hold a firm attitude towards their goals. They believe that the Soviet Union's decision to lift the blockade is only a change of means and not a change of principle. Its main goal is still to place Germany within the Soviet sphere of influence. So far, the goals of the three powers in the Paris talks have been completely unified, but the means or strategies to be adopted at the meeting remain to be unified. Observers here believe that the Soviet Union's policy at the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference will be based on the German plan drafted by the Soviet Union and its satellite countries in Warsaw last June. The declaration issued after the meeting suggested (1) completely disarming Germany; (2) four-power co-management of the Ruhr industrial area; (3) four-power agreement on the organization of an all-German government of various parties; (4) concluding a peace treaty with Germany so that the occupying forces stationed in Germany will withdraw one year after the signing of the peace treaty; (5) formulating measures to make Germany pay compensation.

[US News Service, Washington, October 10] At the Foreign Ministers Conference to be opened in Paris on May 23, the chief representative of the United States will be Secretary of State Acheson, and US Ambassador at Large Jessup will serve as alternate representative. The State Department today announced the temporary list of US representatives as follows: US Representative to the United Nations Dulles will serve as an advisor to the delegation. Dulles is one of the Republican Party's experts on foreign affairs. Murphy, Director of the German and Austrian Affairs Office of the State Department, will serve as the US Deputy Representative on German Affairs. Murphy was originally the political advisor to General Clay, the US military governor in Germany. Special Assistant to the Secretary of State Bartel and Special Assistant to the Ambassador at Large Yust will serve as special assistants to the US Chairman Representative and Alternate Representative respectively. Ketchina, Director of the International Conferences Group of the State Department, will serve as Secretary-General of the delegation. Other advisors to the delegation include State Department Counselor Bohlen, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for German and Austrian Affairs Pim, Director of the Eastern European Affairs Office Reinhardt, Head of the German Political Affairs Group Trivy, Head of the German Economic Affairs Group Reinstein, Officer of the German and Austrian Affairs Office Halleson, and State Department Legal Advisor on German Affairs Oppenheimer. Press releases for the delegation will be handled by State Department Press Liaison Officer McDermott. Jessup and Bohlen will travel to Paris on the 12th to conduct preliminary discussions before the opening of the Foreign Ministers Conference. Acheson and other representatives will fly to France at the end of next month.

### The Berlin Blockade Exceeds Ten Months: Land Traffic Opens Today; First Train in the British Sector Prepares to Depart

[United Press Berlin, November 11] The Berlin blockade, which once almost led to a dispute between the East and West, will end peacefully tonight. At one minute past midnight Berlin time, land traffic to West Germany will be reopened. This is the three hundred and twenty-seventh day of the Soviet blockade of Berlin, and the three hundred and twentieth day of the Anglo-American airlift to break the blockade.

Although the Soviet blockade and the Western counter-blockade are coming to an end, the dispute between the Soviet Union and the Western Allies over the German issue will continue. The second stage of the dispute will begin at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris on May 23.

[United Press, Frankfurt, November 11] Five cars of the first train after the lifting of the Berlin blockade departed from here this morning and are scheduled to arrive at Lier Munster on the border of the British military zone this afternoon to connect with the British military train. The British military train is scheduled to cross the border line tomorrow morning. If there are no obstacles on the way, it will arrive in Berlin at 6:30 am (Berlin time) tomorrow morning. The train will carry British and American officials such as Inglis, the director of the British and American zone traffic office, and about 100 journalists.

Tricolor National Flags Flutter in the Wind

[United Press Berlin, October 10] West Berlin Mayor Luther today ordered the West German flag with red and black colors and gold bars to be hung all over Berlin. Trams and buses will also hang this flag. Buses to Hanover, Hamburg, and Frankfurt in West Germany will also hang this flag. On the first day of the lifting of the Berlin blockade, there will be ten coal trains and six trains carrying fresh potatoes and consumer goods entering Berlin. In the future, 120,000 tons will be supplied to Berlin every day, which is the same as the highest amount of airlift.

Shops in the Western District Are Discounting

[Reuters Berlin, October 10] The people of Berlin believe that the ten-month blockade can be lifted smoothly, and all technical differences can be resolved before the lifting of the blockade. Today, shops in the Western District selling clothing and luxury goods have discounted more than one-tenth of their prices. The Economic Commission of the Soviet Zone expects to be able to obtain a large amount of imports from West Germany in the future, so it has announced the cancellation of quantitative rationing of certain types of clothing, porcelain, bicycle tires, and furniture. The American Governor Clay stated that after the resumption of East-West trade, the Soviet Union will not directly benefit from Marshall Aid. Trade will be based on barter in principle, so Eastern Europe may indirectly obtain some American aid materials.

### West Berlin to Announce New Municipal Plan

Refuses to Compromise with Eastern District Authorities

[Reuters Berlin, 10th] West Berlin City Council Chairman Suhr declared today that after the Berlin blockade is lifted, the West Berlin municipal authorities will still refuse to discuss any topics with the East Berlin authorities, otherwise it will be tantamount to acknowledging "this illegal organization." Unless the East Berlin City Council resigns unconditionally, Berlin will not be able to return to unification. Suhr also stated that when the West Berlin City Council meets at 9:00 AM on the 12th, British Inspector-General Robertson, Deputy Minister McCloy, and Deputy Minister Noailles will also be present. At that time, Mayor Reuter will announce the municipal plan after the lifting of the blockade.

### Bidding Farewell to the German People, McCloy Speaks Earnestly

[United Press Berlin, 11th] U.S. Military Governor for Germany McCloy is about to retire and return to his country. Today, he bid farewell to the Economic Commission of the U.S.-British merged zone in Germany. It is said that the United States hopes for German unification, and it is essential that each occupying zone equally protects the freedoms included in the Bonn Constitution. Germans should dedicate themselves to three major tasks: (1) Understanding freedom; (2) Resolving never to abandon freedom; (3) Using freedom appropriately. McCloy's remarks are consistent with the previous statement of British Military Governor for Germany Robertson, who stated that Western countries will never sell out fundamental democratic rights in the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference.

### West German New Constitution Likely to be Approved by Allied Nations

[Reuters Bonn, 10th] According to an announcement by a British military government spokesman, the three-power governors will meet in Frankfurt on the afternoon of the 12th to approve the West German constitution. Allied officials believe that the three governors will sign and approve the constitution in Frankfurt on the 12th or 13th.

### West Germany Decides to Establish Capital in Bonn; Beethoven's Birthplace Has Beautiful Scenery

[Reuters Bonn, West Germany, 10th] The West German Constitutional Assembly passed a resolution late yesterday by a majority of 203 votes to make Bonn, a city on the Rhine River renowned for its scenery, the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany. During the voting, 29 votes favored making Frankfurt the capital, and both Communist Party members abstained. Bonn is the hometown of the great musician Beethoven and is a famous university town and academic center. During the massive bombing in 1944, most of the university and library were destroyed, but Beethoven's former residence and the Beethoven Museum were fortunately undamaged.

[United Press Bonn, 10th] The Constitutional Assembly also passed the second reading of the West German regime election bill by a vote of 36 to 28. The bill stipulates that anyone who has been a member of the Nazi Party may not be elected as a member of parliament or president of the republic. It also stipulates that the lower house of parliament will have 400 members, half of whom will be elected based on a majority, and the remaining half will be appointed proportionally.

### East-West Economic Systems Can Coexist; Three Powers Have Potential for Cooperation; Moscow Radio Broadcasts in English

[United Press London, 10th] Moscow Radio reporter Vavilov broadcast in English today, stating that cooperation between the economic systems of the United States and the Soviet Union is both possible and necessary. This broadcast, made two weeks before the resumption of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, is particularly noteworthy. Vavilov stated, "The three major powers of the anti-Hitler alliance, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain, have already shown the world that different economic systems can cooperate very successfully during World War II. Since two different economic systems can cooperate during wartime, they can certainly cooperate even better in peacetime. To maintain lasting peace, this cooperation is not only possible but also necessary."

### Austrian Peace Treaty Negotiations Postponed to Next Month

[Reuters London, 11th] The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' representatives' meeting on the Austrian peace treaty, which has continued for three months, was adjourned today. Although the meeting has been going on for three months, no solution has yet been reached on the basic issues in the peace treaty. The only hope for breaking the deadlock now lies in the improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and Western countries after the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference. Discussions on the peace treaty began in July 1947, and have been repeatedly postponed and reopened. The current meeting, which began three months ago, has ultimately failed to produce significant results due to the numerous obstacles in East-West relations. It is now agreed that the next meeting will be held no later than June 25th. It is not yet known whether the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference will discuss the Austrian issue. Britain believes that the Austrian issue may also be discussed at the Paris Conference, but the foreign ministers must first deal with the German issue. Therefore, it is expected that unless the German issue is resolved, the thorny problems in the Austrian peace treaty will be difficult to resolve.

### French Cabinet Approves Atlantic Treaty

Approves the Two German Constitutions with Reservations

[Our News] London, 11th Broadcast: Paris dispatch, the French cabinet unconditionally approved the Atlantic Treaty and the proposed European Parliament. After a three-hour meeting, a communique was issued stating that the two proposals will be submitted to President Auriol for approval, and then submitted to the National Assembly for debate. In addition, the cabinet approved the West German constitution, with some reservations.

### Mrs. Pandit Visits Acheson

Discusses the Presentation of Credentials

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 10th] The newly appointed Indian Ambassador to the United States, Mrs. Pandit, had a brief conversation with Secretary of State Acheson today to discuss the issue of presenting her credentials. Afterwards, she told reporters that India is not currently afraid of the possibility of Chinese Communist troops invading. The ambassador continued, stating that India will be self-sufficient in food in 1950. The food problem is still the most pressing issue, but she has confidence in the future.

### West German Basic Law Guarantees Human Rights, Prevents Re-Aggression; Calls for National Unity, Establishes Foundation for Peace

[United Press Bonn, 10th] Article 146 of the new constitution of the German Federation stands out in the history of constitutions of various countries. The most constitutional provision stipulates the prohibition of aggressive wars and the transfer of national sovereignty to the future European Federation, which is a pioneering move. The chapter on human rights recognizes that "human dignity is inviolable..." All postal and telecommunications inspections, press censorship, and inspections of books, newspapers, and magazines are prohibited. The new constitution not only requires Germans to abide by international law but also gives them greater freedom, a freedom that Germans had not even enjoyed before Hitler.

Any ambitious person who changes the constitution "by force or attempts to change it by force" or usurps the functions of the head of state and becomes a dictator is subject to life imprisonment. German political leaders praised this constitution as "the most progressive charter in the world."

Secondly, the constitutional provisions repeatedly call for national unification, stating that West Germany is only temporary in nature, which shows that it does not want to formally make the east and west parts permanently divided. The preamble states, "The German people, deeply aware of their responsibility to God and to mankind, are determined to preserve their national and political unity, to contribute to world peace in a position of equality in the European Federation, and, on the basis of their constitutional powers, to enact this Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, thereby giving a new order to political life during the transition period. The Parliament is acting on behalf of the other German people (referring to East Germany), whose participation has not been rejected. All the German people must now complete the freedom and unity of Germany through free self-determination." The article on the territory stipulated in the constitution also uses the word "temporary."

The Bonn Constitution, for the sake of emphasizing peace, does not stipulate the establishment of an army or the right to declare war, and declares that no German may be drafted "against his conscience." The article prohibiting aggressive wars or preparing for aggressive wars states: "Any act that disturbs or intends to disturb peaceful relations among countries, especially preparing for aggressive wars, is unconstitutional and should be punished." German security must rely on international collective protection, and its sovereign provisions stipulate that it is transferred to "international institutions" such as the European Federation. In order to maintain peace, the German Federation may participate in "mutual collective security organizations."

Regarding the chapter on human rights, the new constitution stipulates: (1) All people are equal before the law. (2) Freedom of publication and freedom of reporting by radio and film shall be guaranteed and shall not be censored. (3) All German people may engage in peaceful and unarmed gatherings without prior notice or permission. (4) Homes are inviolable. (5) No one shall be discriminated against or privileged because of gender, origin, race, language, belief, or political opinion. (6) "The powers of the states are conferred by the people and shall be exercised by the people through legislative, administrative, and judicial organs."

The constitution declares that people can "freely form" various political parties, but it also lays the foundation for prohibiting the activities of the Communist Party or any militarist faction, stipulating that political parties must be based on "democratic principles" and that those who attempt to endanger the "free democratic basic order" or endanger the existence of the Federation are in violation of the constitution.

### Resolutions of the Commonwealth Conference Will Be Submitted to the Indian Parliament for Approval; Nehru Addresses the Nation in New Delhi

[Agence France-Presse New Delhi, 10th] Indian Prime Minister Nehru broadcast to the nation tonight, expressing satisfaction with the resolution of the long-standing feud between India and Britain, stating: "The fact that the conflict between India and Britain can be resolved in a friendly manner is a good omen." The Prime Minister stated: "I arrived here three days ago after attending the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in London. Today, I am reporting to you on the historic decisions made at this conference. These decisions will be submitted to the Indian Parliament for approval and will be discussed by the All India Congress Committee Council. The work that I and others completed in London last month will be finally evaluated by these two great institutions."

India's Foreign Policy is Friendly to All Countries

Nehru believes that the vast majority of people welcome this resolution. He said: "I have repeatedly declared that our foreign policy is to strive for peace and to have friendly relations with all countries, and to avoid joining political blocs. This is still the guiding principle of our policy. We swore a long time ago to complete India's complete independence. This point has now been completed, but India's union with other states in the Commonwealth does not therefore lose its independence, because this union is completely free and there are absolutely no obligations. We need to know that the Commonwealth does not have the meaning of a super-national country. We have agreed to regard the King of England as the symbolic head of this free union, but the King of England does not have any authority over the position of the Commonwealth. The King of England does not have any position in the Indian Constitution, so we do not have to be loyal to him. When I made this decision, I certainly considered the interests of India, because this is my first responsibility, but I have always believed that the greatest responsibility is the welfare of the whole world. This is the lesson that Mahatma Gandhi gave us. Mahatma also taught us to pursue the path of peace and to be friendly with other countries while maintaining India's freedom and dignity. The world today is full of battles, and a great disaster is brewing. The hatred, fear, and suspicion in the hearts of mankind have blinded their vision. Therefore, we welcome any action that can reduce friction in the world.

India Will Become a Bridge Between East and West

I know very well that there are many situations in some parts of the Commonwealth that make us very dissatisfied, which were the goals of our past solo struggle, but we will deal with these situations as an independent and sovereign country and cannot confuse unrelated matters. India will strive to become a bridge between the warring parties, helping to maintain what is most urgently needed today and in the future, which is world peace. My agreement to the London Agreement is because I firmly believe that India can therefore better promote its policy of encouraging peace and freedom and reducing hatred and friction. We should not waste time on empty debates at this critical juncture in the world, and we should focus our efforts on the most urgent task today, enabling India to become a great and strong country, fulfilling its responsibility to benefit people in Asia and around the world.

### Norwegian Army Exercises

[Reuters Oslo, 10th] Norwegian army officers today began the largest-scale exercises since the war in southeastern Norway, presided over by Army Commander General Munthe-Kaas. Participants included 60 staff and senior officers from various regions, including commanders of various regiments. The goal of the exercises is to study defense conditions and the state of readiness in the southeastern region and around Oslo.

### U.S. Senate Leader Advocates for Restoration of Relations with Spain

[Reuters Washington, 10th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally, during the Senate's discussion of the Spanish issue today, stated that he felt there was no reason why the United States should not send an ambassador to Madrid. He also believed that the State Department was under pressure from foreign countries and could not fully recognize the Franco regime. Connally emphasized that he believed it was unreasonable for the United States to maintain diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union while refusing to maintain diplomatic relations with Spain. It should be noted that the U.S. sends ambassadors to other countries to represent the United States, not other foreign governments. Republican Senator Brewster also believed that the U.S. did not send an ambassador to Madrid due to pressure from Britain and France. Democratic Senator McCarran believes that Spain should also be included in the Atlantic Treaty, because all democratic countries that "believe in God and love freedom" are willing for Spain to participate in the anti-communist front.

### Ireland Demands Return of the North; Protests British Obstruction of Unification

[Reuters Berlin, 10th] The Irish Parliament today unanimously passed a resolution moved by Prime Minister Costello, demanding that Britain end the "current occupation" of Northern Ireland. The resolution expressed angry protest at the British government's submission to the House of Commons of the Ireland Bill, which guarantees the status quo of Northern Ireland, and pointed out that its purpose was to approve and continue the division of Ireland.

[British News Agency London, 11th] Elections for the new People's Congress will be held in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany and the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin on the 15th and 16th of this month. The People's Congress will review and pass the draft constitution of the "German Democratic Republic," which was drafted by the People's Council and passed by the Council on March 19. The constitution does not have checks and balances to prevent one-party dictatorship and has been severely criticized by non-communist German newspapers. The entire organization of the People's Congress and the People's Council, although ostensibly representing all parties and factions and the entire German people, is entirely manipulated by Soviet-zone communists and their followers and is not supported by the majority of the people. Last summer, the organization planned to hold a referendum.

### UN Special Political Committee Decides to Postpone Discussion of Dutch-Indonesian Issue; Postponed to Autumn General Assembly for Further Discussion

[United Press Lake Success, 10th] The UN Special Political Committee today decided to postpone the Dutch-Indonesian dispute to the Autumn General Assembly for discussion. The vote was 42 to 6, with only the Soviet bloc voting against it, and 6 countries abstaining. The proposers were India and Australia, who reasoned that Indonesia and the Netherlands had reached an agreement in Batavia, and that it would be more harmful than beneficial for the UN General Assembly to debate it at this time. Previously, Soviet representative Malik had a verbal battle with the chairman of the committee, Philippine representative Romulo. Malik stated that the Indonesian representative knew nothing about the new Dutch-Indonesian agreement, and that India and Australia's proposal completely trusted the Dutch side. The negotiations in Batavia were negotiations between prisoners and prison guards. The Political Committee should allow the Indonesian representative, Palar, to state his opinions. Romulo replied that the Soviet proposal was difficult to accept, and that the Indian-Australian proposal was in fact a proposal to postpone the discussion, and that according to the UN General Assembly's regulations, this type of proposal was a procedural issue that must be discussed first. Furthermore, the Indonesian representative, Palar, does not wish to speak at this time. Malik stated that this proves that the representative was deprived of his right to speak, because the leaders of the Indonesian Republic are in exile on Bangka Island. We must admit that all this is a conspiracy of the Dutch government. Romulo advised Malik not to go beyond the topic, and Malik countered: "The chairman wants to prevent me from speaking, I will do so." Romulo replied: "Your representative has the right to speak, as long as you do not exceed the procedural issues, and do not touch the substance of the Dutch-Indonesian dispute. "Indian representative Shiva Rao stated that India does not intend to please any foreign country, and that the Southeast Asian 19-country conference to discuss the Indonesian issue was convened by India. We do not ask to cancel this issue, we only ask that it be postponed to the Autumn General Assembly for discussion. Pakistani representative Zafrulla stated that Pakistan will support the Indian-Australian proposal.

### Division Two Basketball Tournament: Shantou Team and Chongde Kang Team Advance; Three More Exciting Matches Tonight

At 14-9, Pang team was forced to call a timeout. Indeed, Zhang Shaoxiang and Huang Yang successively broke through the basket, closing the gap to 13-14. However, Yuan Qing and Xu Xingeng of Chongde applied frequent pressure, and Zhu Neng eventually caught up. At 24-17, Pang team called another timeout, but it did not improve the situation. At 24, the Chongde players, led by the Nie family, roamed freely, ending the first half with a score of 43-24.

Shantou team added another five points, making it 12-5. Mao Xun replaced Chen Kan with Zhu Jianxiong and called two timeouts, secretly discussing strategies, but it was difficult to stem Shantou team's offensive. Mao Xun then replaced Wang Gongsen with Zhu Lvqian. Chen Qingjiang and Zheng Guofan of Shantou team combined their efforts, increasing the lead to 18-7. Zhuo Guanzheng and Zhu Lvqian of Mao Xun scored three points from throws and free throws, but Luo Shaoqiong scored again, giving Shantou team a 20-9 lead in the first half.

### Division One Table Tennis League: Lianxing vs. Bank of China Tonight

Previous Matches Featured Outstanding Performances by Chou Bai and Chou Hong

The fourth Table Tennis League continues today (the 12th) with one Division One match and three Division Two matches. In Division One, Lianxing will face Bank of China. Lianxing was last year's third-place finisher and has trained diligently this year, harboring strong ambitions to win the championship. They have strong players such as Hu Yiping, Wu Zuochang, Zhang Shanda, and Feng Hao. Although their reputation is second to the two powerhouses Jingwu and Huamei, their players have well-rounded skills in both offense and defense, making them more balanced than any other team. Bank of China will find it difficult to win against such a strong team. If they can put forth their best effort and persevere, they will surely make their opponents think twice about underestimating them.

All three Division Two matches are crucial for their future, and each will feature intense moments. In Division Two Group One, You Si, with six wins and one loss, and in Division Two Group Two, Lianhe, with four wins and no losses, will face formidable opponents Haiguang and Chongben, respectively. They may face dangerous situations. In another match in Division Two Group One, Lingxia will face Ling Team. The former was last year's Division Three runner-up, but they have already been defeated by the "dark horse" Shanbao. The latter is a seeded team from the talk department, but unfortunately, they have already been defeated by the new team Hongbai. Both teams have lost once, and they cannot afford to lose this match. The winner will still have a chance, while the loser will have no hope. A fierce battle is inevitable. The schedule for today is as follows:

Lianxing vs. Bank of China (Division One) 6 PM

Haiguang vs. You Si (Division Two Group One) 7 PM

Chongben vs. Lianhe (Division Two Group Two) 7 PM

Lingyun vs. Ling Team (Division Two Group One) 6 PM

The previous day, Bank of China played against Chou Bai in the latter's table tennis room. Bank of China's lineup was incomplete, so it was inevitable that they would lose. Wang Shaozeng and Zhu Guozhen fought hard against Yang Changxi and Chang Jiakun of Chou Bai, and the battle was extremely intense. In the end, they were exhausted and lost two matches in a row. In the third match, Zhu Yongkang of Bank of China defeated Kong Hanchen in straight sets to win back one match. In the fourth and fifth matches, Bank of China sent out reserve players, so they were no match for Chou Bai and lost successively. As a result, Chou Bai defeated Bank of China 4-1. Among the Division Two matches, the seeded team of Division Three, Xin Xing, performed abnormally. Jian Jiang Gao Shangzhi was out of luck and lost 1-2, forfeiting the victory. Chou Hong benefited from this unexpected gain and was in high spirits. Newcomer Wu Canpeng was inspired and defeated Li Baoyan in straight sets. As a result, Xin Wu suffered another blow and has lost hope of being selected, which is a pity. The results of the two matches and the previous matches are as follows:

Results of the Two Matches

(Chou Bai) Score (Bank of China)

Yang Changxi 2-1 Wang Shaozeng

Yang Changjia 2-1 Zhu Guozhen

Kong Hanchen 0-2 Zhu Yongkang

Weng Shuheng 2-0 Liang Wenyun

### Accomplices in Xu Wentian Treason Case: Chen Tilu and Five Others Executed by Firing Squad

[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Police Department executed five people by firing squad at the Song Park Road execution grounds in Zhabei yesterday at 4 PM. The five were convicted of treason and collaborating with the enemy. The executed were Chen Tilu, Zhang Dasheng, Fang Zhichen, Zhu Datong, and Wang Wenzong. Li Yalong, the deputy director of the Changshu Police Sub-bureau, served as the execution supervisor. These five criminals were all important figures in the "Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary Alliance" organized by Xu Wentian and others. They specialized in inciting mutiny among the National Army, attempting to coordinate with the Communist Army's crossing of the Yangtze River. The mutinies of Jia Yibin's unit from the past He Yu Gan Tuan, Wang Changyan's unit of the 97th Division, Dai Rongguang's unit, the commander of the Jiangyin Fortress, and the 88th Army stationed in Digang were all incited by this organization. Many of these five people were members of the Kuomintang. The authorities believed that they stole a good name, organized illegal groups, sold out the Party and the country, endangered the survival of the nation, and willingly surrendered to the Communists. Their crimes were heinous, so they were presented to Commander-in-Chief Tang for a death sentence, which was approved. According to the police department's announcement:

Chen Tilu

Age 50, from Huaiyin, Jiangsu. He was the director of the Nanjing Wenfeng Bookstore and served as the executive committee member and director of the Guizhou Provincial Party Headquarters, the executive committee member of the Shandong Provincial Party Headquarters, the director of the Battlefield Party Affairs Office of the Central Organization Department, a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the dean of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Two-District Training Corps. In November of last year, he initiated the organization of the "Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary Alliance" with Gao Zongyu, Xu Wentian, Liu Butong, and Chen Xiaoling. He served as a standing committee member and organization minister of the pseudo-General Alliance, and also as the person in charge of the Shanghai Branch Alliance. He was the primary drafter of the "Sun Alliance" organizational outline. He also participated in Li Jishen's pseudo-"Kuomintang Reform Committee." He instigated Yan Yimin to defect from our Garrison Headquarters' senior advisor Chen Zumin (Chen understood righteousness and was not moved). He assigned Zhang Dasheng to cross the river to contact the Communists, attempting to divide the government's strength and coordinate with the Communist bandits' crossing of the river, betraying the Party and harming the country, and slandering the leader. He confessed these facts in his interrogation records and his confession.

Zhang Dasheng

Also known as Zhi Ren, 41 years old, from Xiaoxian, Jiangsu. He was the president of the Jiangsu branch of the China Cultural Service Agency and served as the deputy commander of the 18th Column of the Lu-Su-Yu Border Region Headquarters. In the winter of last year, he joined the "Sun Alliance" through Chen Tilu's connection and served as a committee member and secretary of the Jiangsu Branch Alliance. He was also ordered by Chen Tilu to go to Huaiyin, northern Jiangsu, to contact the Communists. From the contents of the Jiangsu Branch Alliance's February 28, 1939, political report resolution—the current political situation and our strategic line—it can be observed that the criminal slandered the leader, attacked our Party, responded to the Communist bandits, and conspired to subvert the government. He admitted these facts in his interrogation records and his confession.

Fang Zhinong

Age 35, from Anhui County, Anhui. He was a teacher at Nanjing Anhui Middle School. In early February of this year, he joined the "Sun Alliance" through Xu Wentian's introduction and served as the secretary of the General Alliance. He confessed to participating in the "Sun Alliance's" acts of betraying the Party and harming the country.

Zhu Datong

Also known as Gong Tao, age 42, from Xiaoxian, Jiangsu. He served as the magistrate of Xiaoxian and is currently an employee of the Kaiyuan Coal Mine Company at Xiashu Station. In late February of this year, he joined the "Sun Alliance" Jiangsu Provincial Branch Alliance through Zhang Dasheng's introduction. According to his confession, he attended two meetings of the branch alliance in Wuxi and Zhenjiang and admitted to being involved in military operations. After verifying the handwriting of the letter from "Kaili" and "Gong Tao" addressed to Gui Shuren, the mayor of Communist Yangzhou, which was seized from Ma Shewen, it was confirmed to be written by the criminal. There is no doubt that he colluded with the Communist bandits and plotted wrongdoing.

Wang Wenzong

Age 29, from Wujin, Jiangsu. He was a clerk at the Jiangsu Provincial Training Corps. He joined the "Sun Alliance" Jiangsu Provincial Branch Alliance through Song Changhuang's introduction and was responsible for clerical work. The booklet of the branch alliance's February 28, 1939, political report resolution was written by him. Reviewing the criminal's diary, his thoughts were radical, and he willingly participated in acts of harming the country.

[Another report] It is reported that after the authorities cracked down on the "Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary Alliance," a treasonous and enemy-collaborating organization formed by Legislative Yuan members Xu Wentian and Liu Butong, Xu and others used their status as members of the Legislative Yuan to obtain bail in Nanjing. When the Communist army crossed the Yangtze River and occupied Nanjing, Xu, Liu, and others openly came forward to help with the takeover of government agencies.

### Social Affairs Bureau Calls Labor and Management Organizations to Discuss Technical Issues of Salary Payments

[Report from our newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Industrial Association, and the General Labor Union yesterday morning to discuss the technical issues of paying salaries after converting wages to silver dollars.

Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau convened various public utility agencies and informed them that the salary payment method announced by the Garrison Department must not be changed.

### Head of Household Registration Raised the Price of Registration Forms: Leader Sentenced to Seven Years

[Report from our newspaper] Yuan Junhua was the leader of the 40th Jia of the 6th Bao of the Yulin District of this city. In October of last year, he colluded with Chen Fazuo, the cadre of the 6th Bao under his jurisdiction, to raise the price of household registration application forms to 5,000 yuan per copy, jointly seeking illegal profits. The case was investigated and discovered by the police bureau and transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution.

### Silver Bulls Change Business to Carrying Goods, Carrying Silver Dollars to Other Regions to Sell, and Bringing Pork and Other Goods to Shanghai to Sell

[Report from our newspaper] Since the authorities clearly stipulated that the price of silver dollars in various districts of this city should be uniformly limited to 4 million Gold Yuan, the "yellow bulls" who generally engaged in silver dollar transactions have found it unprofitable in Shanghai. In addition to a small number who have changed their business to "street vending," the rest have transformed into carrying goods, going to Songjiang, Qingpu, and other places to sell silver dollars. Currently, in Songjiang, each silver dollar can be sold for 6.4 million yuan, and in Qingpu, each silver dollar can be sold for 4.8 million yuan. The discounted price of silver dollars in Kunshan, Lujiabang, Jiading, Taicang, and other places is also higher than in Shanghai, regardless of the type. After selling their silver dollars, they buy low-priced pork, eggs, white rice, etc. locally and bring them to Shanghai for sale. Then, they carry cigarettes, soap, and other daily necessities from Shanghai back to various places for sale, engaging in trade back and forth and making huge profits. Under these circumstances, the inventory of silver dollars and daily necessities in this city has flowed to other regions in recent weeks, and the reverse flow of cash from other regions to Shanghai has also been considerable.

### Difference Between In-Market and Out-of-Market Prices Narrows: Gold Market Returns to Normal

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday's gold market was steady with an upward trend. Because the in-market price limit has reached beyond 2.4 billion, while the general asking price is below 2.4 billion, it has entered a normal state, and trading has gradually become active.

There were few transactions at noon, and the appetite of all parties was not good, with only three transactions being made.

### Cotton Yarn Trading Stagnant

Cotton yarn trading was very sluggish yesterday. Although there were calls for prices on the floor, there were very few transactions. Only a few popular goods saw sporadic trading. Customers, due to shipping difficulties and speculative risks, remained passive observers. The local market had an oversupply, and transaction prices were still slightly lower by 10 to 20 million yuan per bale compared to the previous day.

According to market sources, cotton yarn trading is unlikely to flourish in the short term. Most factories in the copying industry have shut down, speculative transactions are almost non-existent, and major players have gone to South China. Only a few small players are still trading.

### Cotton Cloth Market Weak

The cotton cloth market was weak, and merchants' sentiments were low. Although there was some bolstering by floor traders, it briefly prospered, and quoted prices were very close to the previous day's highest prices. However, due to ample supply from various sources taking advantage of the high prices, combined with generally weak prices outside the customs area, prices softened again at the close.

Dragon Head Fine Cloth opened low at 17,400,000, reaching a maximum of 18,600,000 mid-session, a drop of 400,000 compared to the previous day. Four Gentlemen Serge opened 1,000,000 lower at 18,000,000, then rose to 19,200,000, closing at 18,400,000 at noon, a decrease of 600,000. Five Blessings Fine Cloth was traded at 14,600,000, down 1,400,000. Trumpet Child Fine Cloth was traded at 14,800,000, down 1,600,000.

The cotton market was stable, and trading was slightly more active. Zhoupu seed cotton was quoted at 10,000,000. Hankou fine velvet was used in the exchange of 6,600,000 for every 100 market pounds. Jingfu fine velvet was exchanged for 12 pounds per 100 market pounds, Shenhu fine cloth was exchanged at 5.8 bolts, Hankou fine velvet was exchanged at 625 pounds for 20 count Earth Yarn, Jingyang was exchanged at 820 pounds for 42 count Water Moon Yarn, and other transactions were not idle.

### Various Sectors' Anti-Communist National Salvation Committee Launches "Frontline First, Soldiers First" Campaign

(6) Improve the staple food for officers and soldiers, ensuring that the rice quality is not too poor. (7) Send photos and stories of combat heroes to various newspapers to show respect and promote their achievements.

### Rice Prices Rise Again

Rice trading was temporarily suspended in the South Market yesterday due to the presence of troops. The North Market continued trading as usual. Rice shops, due to the South Market's closure, increased their purchases in the North Market, leading to active sales and rising prices. White japonica, thin paddy rice, and indica rice were all traded at a high of 37,000,000 yuan, up 4,000,000 yuan each. Medium-grade early rice was at 34,000,000 yuan, with only 196 dan of registered arrivals.

The markets for miscellaneous grains and edible oils were temporarily suspended yesterday. However, retail stores still had to purchase from the market, so they eagerly awaited the resumption of trading.

The flour market rebounded yesterday. Bingship morning open at 7,500,000, good clearing in Central Market, Market price rising slowly, and later broke through eight barriers, closing at noon at 82,000,000, Old Car 84,000,000, Red Sound, Jiancheng, Dafa, Peacock, slightly traded, bran still not opening.

Raw sesame oil rose sharply, and soybeans also rose sharply, with Sangyuan beans and winter beans both closing at 14,000,000.

### Industrial Association Cables Authorities to Purchase Finished Products and Provide Loans to Solve Mid-Month Salary Payment Issues

[Our Newspaper] In response to the current industrial crisis in the city, the Municipal Industrial Association has cabled the Municipal Government, Central Bank, and other agencies to request the purchase of finished products and the provision of loans to resolve the issue of paying salaries in the middle of the month. They also requested permission to lay off some workers to extend the livelihood of the remaining workers in the city. The original telegram stated briefly: Since transportation from North China has been cut off, the Yangtze River has been obstructed, and recently, train services between Nanjing and Shanghai, and Shanghai and Hangzhou have been reduced again. Although sea routes are available, the reduced number of ships makes transportation difficult. As a result, the export of finished industrial products from the city has come to a standstill. In this extraordinary period, factories in various industries cannot stop production nor lay off workers. To maintain social stability and the livelihood of workers, they must make every effort to find solutions. However, funds are exhausted, and they have reached a desperate situation. Taking the salary payment at the end of last month as an example, due to a lack of funds, various factories were forced to pay wages in the form of their own products. Recently, street vendors are crowded, and all kinds of goods are gathered, because these workers are selling their products to make a living. The tragic situation is imaginable. In the blink of an eye, it is again time to pay wages in the middle of the month. According to the temporary measures for calculating employee salaries promulgated, with 600,000 employees in the city, half a month's salary requires approximately 3,000,000 silver dollars, equivalent to 12 trillion gold yuan, a huge sum. The daily funds of various banks in the Central Bank and their joint reserve deposits have never reached this figure. Moreover, in this time of industrial decline, how can they raise such funds? This is the reality and not an excuse. If the government does not provide assistance, the consequences will be dire. The Association, in its duty, dares not remain silent, lest it add to the offense. Therefore, it earnestly presents the current real situation of industry and cables to request that the government, considering the unprecedented crisis faced by industry and the survival of hundreds of thousands of workers, provide strong assistance. It requests that the Central Bank, based on the number of workers in each factory, calculate the required amount of wages, regardless of the type of factory, purchase their finished products, and allow them to be exchanged for silver dollars. For those without finished products (such as the machine industry), loans should be provided based on the number of workers to solve the problem of paying wages in the first half of the month, to maintain the minimum livelihood of workers and protect the endangered industry from collapse. Furthermore, factories are in an extraordinary period and are unlikely to be able to sustain themselves for long. As the countryside is in need of labor during the busy farming season, it is proposed to allow the dismissal of some workers so that they can return to their hometowns to engage in agriculture, which can reduce the burden on various factories, reduce the city's food consumption, and extend the livelihood of the remaining workers. However, convenience and security should be provided for the transportation and along the way of dismissed workers.

### Six Districts Cotton Textile Association Requests National Bank Loan

[Our Newspaper] Recently, due to the disconnection between production and sales and the stagnation of business, the selling prices of various yarn factories in the city are lower than the costs, and the payment of wages cannot be delayed, making their situation extremely difficult. The Cotton Textile Association of the Six Districts convened a meeting of representatives from various member factories in the city yesterday and decided on the spot that all directors and supervisors and representatives from various factories would immediately take a letter to the Central Bank requesting an emergency industrial loan of 800 million yuan, with the production equipment of each factory as collateral, to provide relief. There are currently 1.6 million yarn spindles in private yarn factories in the city (including converted looms). If each 10,000 spindles requires 100 billion yuan in monthly wages, the total requirement would be 16 trillion yuan. If the Central Bank approves a loan of 800 million yuan, the remaining half, 800 million yuan, would still need to be raised by the factories themselves to overcome the difficulties and continue production.

### Nantong Sojourners Association in Shanghai to Hold Directors and Supervisors Meeting Today

The Nantong Sojourners Association in Shanghai recently elected Ma Junshuo and Cai Guohua as Chairman and Vice Chairman, respectively, to be stationed at the association and take responsibility.

Fellow villagers who have temporarily come to Shanghai and have not yet obtained a National Identity Card for the city, or those who have come to Shanghai and have no one to rely on, can go to the association at No. 149 Wujin Road to register. Furthermore, the association's affairs are being actively developed, and the cooperation and service of fellow villagers in Shanghai are urgently needed. A joint meeting of directors and supervisors was scheduled to be held at the association at 3:00 PM today. Additionally, a portion of the association's premises is occupied by military officers' dependents. The Garrison Headquarters has been telegraphed to urge them to move out.

### Taiwan's Financial Industry

[Taipei 3rd Dispatch] The earliest financial institutions in Taiwan were "Ma Zhen Halls," which were essentially comprador agencies. In the year that Japan took control of Taiwan (1895), the Neutral Bank of Japan established a branch in Taiwan, which can be considered the earliest bank in Taiwan. Later, this bank merged with the Thirty-Fourth Bank of Japan and was renamed the Thirty-Fourth Bank. In 1933, it merged with the Yamaguchi and Hong Kong Land Banks and was renamed the Sanwa Bank. These were purely Japanese banks. In 1899, the Bank of Taiwan, which had the role of a "central bank" in Taiwan, was established. Subsequently, the Taiwan Savings Bank, specializing in savings, the Changhua Bank, with a local focus, the Commercial and Industrial Bank, with a commercial focus, the Industrial Bank of Japan, responsible for agricultural development, and the South China Bank, with an aggressive mission, and the cooperative-oriented Industrial and Financial Association were established one after another. After the Restoration, the government reorganized and merged these banks to form the existing banks, as follows:

Bank of Taiwan

This bank is the central hub of Taiwan's finance. After the Restoration, it was reorganized by merging the Sanwa Bank of Japan, the old Bank of Taiwan, and the old Taiwan Savings Bank. It officially opened in 1946 with a total capital of NT$60 million, allocated by the national treasury. In addition to conducting general banking business, it was specially authorized to issue NT$ within a specified amount and was entrusted by the government to handle the issuance, interest payment, and redemption of government bonds, to act as an agent for public treasuries at all levels and other matters entrusted by the government, and to act as an agent for various businesses entrusted by the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank. The bank's head office is located in Taipei, with 77 branches and agencies inside and outside the province. Its businesses include deposits, loans, remittances, issuance, trusts, and savings. As of the end of 1948, the bank's total deposits reached NT$300,808,342,000, an increase of NT$7,219,000 compared to the bank's deposits in 1946. During the same period, total loans were NT$345,167,187,000, mostly used for agricultural, industrial, and mining production, as well as fertilizer and water conservancy loans. The bank has the exclusive right to handle remittances outside the province, but currently, to avoid the impact of mainland prices on Taiwan, all remittances from outside the province have been temporarily suspended. Military and industrial remittances require the approval of the provincial government. The adjustment of the exchange rate between NT$ and gold yuan has been a "disease prevention dam" for Taiwan's prices against those in mainland provinces. In the past, it has been quite effective, but now it has gradually lost its effectiveness. Although the exchange rate has been adjusted from 3,703 to 163 within two months, Taiwan's prices are still rising wildly. According to a comparison of price indices, during the "August 19" period in Shanghai in 1947, prices rose 43 times, while prices in Taipei rose only 1.5 times. However, by the end of last year, prices in Shanghai had risen 120 times compared to the end of 1947, while prices in Taipei had also risen more than 12 times. It can be seen that the adjustment of the exchange rate of the Taiwan currency has gradually lost its effectiveness. The amount of Taiwan currency issued was only NT$5,330,593,000 from the Restoration to the end of 1946, but it had reached NT$14,819,912,000 by the end of 1947, and had increased to NT$89,085,725,000 by the end of 1948, not including the issuance of banknotes. The authorities are now working hard to contract the currency supply and step up production to avoid the disastrous consequences of hyperinflation in the Taiwan currency.

Taiwan Land Bank

At the beginning of Taiwan's Restoration, the government, in order to meet actual needs and realize banking specialization, established the bank in 1946 and took over all branches of the Industrial Bank of Japan in Taipei, Tainan, Taichung, Kaohsiung, and Hsinchu, reorganizing them into branches in their original locations. The total capital was NT$60 million, allocated by the national treasury at once. The head office is located in Taipei. The main tasks of the bank are to regulate land finance, capitalize land capital, so that fixed land and housing can obtain the necessary working capital, so that land can be fully utilized, especially focusing on rural areas to assist the government in implementing land policies; and to develop agriculture and forestry by directly assisting the development of agricultural, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry production projects through agricultural loans or investments.

Taiwan Industrial and Commercial Bank

The bank was originally named the Taiwan Commercial and Industrial Bank during the Japanese occupation period. After the Restoration, it was reorganized and renamed the Taiwan Industrial and Commercial Bank, and the capital was increased to NT$16 million, divided into 320,000 shares. It was jointly operated by the government and private individuals. The government subscribed to 180,601 shares, and the rest were private shares. In addition to vigorously absorbing floating capital, the bank also provides funds to small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises and also provides agricultural funds, so it has provided much support to local businesses. The bank's head office is located in Taipei, with a total of 27 branches and offices in the province.

Recent News from the University of Vienna

[Our Newspaper] The Chinese students from various departments who went to Vienna to study last year in batches are studying at the University of Vienna and elsewhere. Recently, the Dean of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Vienna sent a letter to the Austrian Embassy in China, stating that the 18 students who applied for and were approved to participate in the winter registration on July 31, 1948, have been granted an extension to register on March 1, 1949 (spring) or October 1, 1949 (winter) due to various difficulties in entering and leaving the country. In addition, the school has degrees available for 25 more Chinese students, but there are no scholarships available.

### An Account of Grudges and Gratitude in the Greater Liang Mountains (Part II)

"Intending to take his late father's pacification troops by force," this was Sun Fang's entire crime. When this decree was spread throughout the countryside and openly posted on the streets of Xichang, Sun Fang, in order to defend himself, when Deng Deliang's battalion entered to reinforce from Kangding, was wiped out by Sun Fang in Tuolang. Deng Deliang then marched on Xichang, ordering Chang Huwujiao to attack Luomuqie in Ningdong and Wazhaji to attack Nazhidayu in Hongmao to provide support. The two Yi leaders who were attacked were both members of the Yi ethnic sightseeing tour group. At the same time, Deng Deliang attacked Shachang, looting the family members and residences of Sun's officers. As a result, the situation in Xichang changed sharply, people were panicked, rumors spread, communications between Lugu and Xichang were cut off, and wild Yi people took advantage of the situation to loot. He Guoguang then hurriedly returned to Xichang from Chongqing at the end of last month to suppress the situation. The day before his departure, he told reporters, "The Yi people are very barbaric when they fight, burning, killing, and looting, doing everything. I want to try my best to resolve this issue peacefully."

He Guoguang has been back for half a month, but not a single piece of peaceful news has been heard from the Greater Liang Mountains. Presumably, he cannot "suppress" the situation. He, in anger, consulted with Liu Wenhui and obtained his consent to add the 136th Division of Liu's forces to deal with Deng Deliang. Local people, seeing that the situation was not good, repeatedly asked He to consider the achievements of the late Commander Deng Xiuting in governing the Yi people and to forgive the orphans. On April 2, He agreed to give Deng Deliang three days to repent.

Telegraph from Fellow Villagers of Xikang in Chongqing

However, to date, three days have passed, and what is the result? There is no news. The Xikang Fellow Villagers Association in Chongqing initially telegraphed General He Guoguang, urging him to resolve the issue peacefully to avoid devastation of the region. The day before yesterday, it suddenly telegraphed again, requesting the pacification office to dismiss and investigate Liu Wenhui. The evolution of the matter is truly extremely subtle. The original telegram is as follows:

"To the Southwest Chief Executive's Office: Regarding the Sun-Deng dispute in Ning, this association, with pity for our homeland, telegraphed Pacification Commander He, earnestly requesting a peaceful resolution to avoid local devastation. To end the dispute, it seems appropriate to delineate the responsibilities of Sun and Deng, and jointly maintain local security to strengthen the rear. As for the Tianlu Rongbao civil unrest, according to generally credible rumors, it is the result of Kang Liu's subordinates and children disregarding the law, much like the Rongjing incident of the past. Generally, gentry are deeply dissatisfied with Liu's poisoning of Xikang, while the people are taking the risk and echoing each other, leading to a major change. To prevent future occurrences, it is proposed to dismiss and investigate Liu Wenhui and appoint an impartial official to preside over Kang's administration to pacify the frontier and stabilize the rear. The colleagues of this association remember the brethren of their hometown and cherish the tombs of their ancestors. We express our views impartially and without any grievances. We respectfully telegraph for your consideration. Xikang Province Fellow Villagers Association in Chongqing (38) Mao Zhen Yin."

The person in charge of the Xikang Fellow Villagers Association in Chongqing has been frequently visiting the door of Zhang Dulun, Secretary-General of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, hoping that Zhang can help with the peace in the Ning region because Zhang Dulun once served as the Director of the Xichang Pacification Headquarters and is also the "in-law" of General Deng Xiuting (Zhang's son, who died in a plane crash, married Deng's daughter). Half a month ago, someone saw Zhang Dulun writing to Liu Wenhui, begging him to withdraw his troops, presumably hoping that the 136th Division would not put too much pressure on his mother-in-law. With the rising voice of "Down with Liu" today, it seems that the crisis is lurking everywhere, and the situation seems to be getting more and more serious.

The Destruction of the Anti-Japanese Construction Reclamation Society

Currently, the Anti-Japanese Construction Reclamation Society in the Leima Pingbian area seized "Chunyan," causing a dispute between the Han and Yi people. The Yi people have destroyed the Anti-Japanese Construction Reclamation Society, and the residences of the reclaimers have been burned to ruins. Lv Zhenhua, the general manager of the Anti-Japanese Construction Reclamation Society, is trapped in Dahe. The Yi people continue to advance towards Pingshan County. On the other hand, the northeastern part of Yunnan Province has been controlled by the bandit army of Zhu Jiafeng and his ilk. If the internal disputes in the Ningjing Border Pacification Headquarters cannot be resolved reasonably, the forces suppressing the Yi people will instead become a fuse for inciting the Yi people to rebel. With the slightest carelessness, the entire border area of Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces may turn into a Han-Yi conflict. Uncivilized wild Yi people will take the opportunity to loot. The disturbance caused by these tens of thousands of savage Yi people, in this area where "defeated troops are frequently defeated, and generals are often sent on expeditions," even if Zhuge Liang were resurrected, it would not be possible to pacify it in one or two years.

As the manuscript was being written, good news came. He Guoguang has replied to the Xikang Fellow Villagers Association in Chongqing, stating that he is determined to resolve this dispute peacefully. The compatriots in the southwest, who have not been directly damaged by the long-term external and internal wars, are all earnestly hoping that this living "Account of Grudges and Gratitude in the Greater Liang Mountains" will end with good news.

### Fires of War and Smoke-Filled Lands: Where to Find Paradise? A Hong Kong Diary

[Hong Kong, 3rd] Fires of war rage, and smoke fills the land. Anyone with a desire for life, wouldn't they want to find a paradise, to dream of "escaping the Qin"? Unfortunately, Tao Yuanming has been dead for over a thousand years. People yearn for a "Peach Blossom Spring," but where can they find such a "guide"?

If you feel that this place truly suits your current status, if you feel satisfied with everything here, then you should be proud that our ancestors had the foresight to give this place to the British Empire a hundred years ago, leaving a "paradise" for their descendants.

However, if you still have some Chinese blood in your veins, and if you haven't developed amnesia and forgotten your heritage, then when you come to this Chinese land ruled by foreigners, you should know that you are an expatriate. All the good and beautiful things, the paradise-like happiness given to you, are from those foreigners with high noses and yellow hair. One day, whenever they please, they can take back this thing you think is good, beautiful, and happy.

Then you might feel a bit lost again.

Perhaps you're very lucky, and the day you arrive in Hong Kong is a night.

At the end of the sea, you see myriads of lights, as dense as stars, seemingly suspended in the air. The lights illuminate the green strait, shimmering like ten thousand golden snakes, rushing towards your feet, welcoming you, the distinguished guest from afar.

What could be more beautiful than such a scene? You cheer, you imagine even more beautiful and lovely scenes on the shore. Perhaps your relatives, or your loved one, are waiting for you to embrace them warmly.

Have you read about relativity? Good luck is often followed by bad luck.

The ship's officer announced to your fellow travelers – all the passengers: "We cannot disembark today!"

"Why?"

"The colonial quarantine office hasn't come for inspection yet!"

"Why haven't they come?"

"It's past office hours, they're off work!"

"Shanghai issued a quarantine certificate, what else needs to be checked? If you don't trust Shanghai, why did Shanghai issue a certificate?" You complain a bit.

"These are British regulations, I don't know!" The officer is enforcing "British law," perhaps implying that he is already a "Britisher." Of course, you wouldn't believe it, because his nose isn't high, his hair isn't yellow, and especially those rat-like eyes almost dilute that bit of "British" air.

The towering foreign buildings, the flat, clean asphalt roads, the orderly cross-harbor ferries shuttling back and forth, the double-decker trams without the congestion of Shanghai, the readily available, beautiful, and luxurious "buses" that are even better than private cars, the magnificent, stable, and affordable "buses," and the elegant senior Chinese figures with a touch of British "eel-like" demeanor – all of this is unimaginable for those who have long lived in Shanghai and experienced all kinds of chaos, entanglements, suffocation, and terror.

However, that is only one side of Hong Kong. Have you seen the other side? Just like in the mainland, aren't those magnificent buildings and flat roads built upon the blood and sweat of millions of laborers? Out of 1.8 million people, how many live in Western-style houses? How many live in "wooden houses" that are even more rudimentary than those shacks in Pudong? How many don't even qualify to live in a wooden house? A few days ago, six thugs robbed a money exchange shop in the busiest downtown area, shooting and injuring three people. The Hong Kong government's reward for capturing the thugs changed three times in one day, from one thousand to five thousand, and from five thousand to ten thousand. But this is only because the incident occurred in the bustling city center. How many such robberies happen in more remote areas every day? If you visit a friend who has a bit of "influence," the doorman takes your business card from a small hole less than five inches square. After a long wait, only then does he open the door and invite you in. Then you will realize how people in this paradise live a cautious life, always being vigilant against the entry of "uninvited guests."

When you first arrive in Hong Kong, you will naturally have some desire to travel. Won't you come to Hong Kong to eat some seafood? Fish of unknown species wearing various colorful patterns, lobsters weighing three or four pounds, crabs almost as big as small washbasins, and fresh abalone, fresh scallops, countless and unrecognizable seafood, waiting for you to choose. Won't you go to Victoria Peak in Hong Kong to overlook the entire view of Hong Kong and Kowloon? The flagship of the British admiral, viewed from the mountain, is no different from the small ornaments in your home. However, you must be careful, whether it's a bus or a mountain cable car, it may encounter the patronage of thugs, causing you to return disappointed after going there in high spirits. Friends, you will feel that this overseas paradise is sometimes "difficult to move even an inch," right?

Where can you find a paradise in this world? After being in Hong Kong for forty-eight hours, you may sigh like this.

### A Glimpse of the Rural Areas of Jiangnan

Bad Spring Blossoms, Difficult Autumn Harvests

[Reported by This Newspaper] When price controls were lifted last year, after the appropriate autumn harvest, rice prices soared. Many rice merchants desperately purchased rice from rural areas at slightly higher prices. Farmers, shortsighted and lured by the current Gold Yuan Certificates, sold their rice one after another. By the time they had sold it, rice prices continued to rise, and their rice was almost completely gone. It was too late for regret. Currently, there are too many various taxes and levies imposed in the countryside, all standardized against the price of rice. Farmers, helpless, have to buy rice at high prices to pay off these levies and assessments. I once asked a large rice merchant in Hangzhou how much rice was left in the countryside. He said there was probably very little. His reason was that after price controls were lifted last year, farmers, seeing the good rice prices, sold their rice one after another and exchanged it for gold. Now, when the countryside needs rice, they exchange gold for rice. Based on this merchant's testimony, we can at least know that there is really very little rice left in the countryside.

With bad spring blossoms and difficult autumn harvests, and little rice left in the countryside, how will we cope with this year's crisis? Which is this year's unprecedented famine!

### Nightingale of the United Nations

— Heralding

What makes the United Nations General Assembly most convenient for the attending representatives is the "translation breeze" set up in the venue. Without it, I don't know how much time the great organization devoted to the well-being of mankind would lose, and how much spiritual separation would be increased between these dozens of countries. Originally, if two nations or countries did not speak the same language, there was no way to talk about mutual understanding, and even unnecessary misunderstandings could arise as a result. But here, the scientists of the United Nations easily solved this important problem for us.

The first problem to be solved is the language problem. Although there are thousands of different languages in the world, only a few are commonly used in diplomacy, so there is no need to adapt to dialects from all over the world. Initially, only five languages were used in the United Nations meetings: Chinese, French, English, Soviet, and Spanish. Later, due to improvements in equipment and considering the convenience of the representatives of several small European countries, German and Italian were added in addition to the above five, which was almost sufficient.

Its equipment can be roughly divided into two periods. Initially, it could only translate the above five languages into English, and then transmit them to the representatives through loudspeakers or earphones. However, the English proficiency of representatives from all over the world was not necessarily good, so it was naturally easy to cause misunderstandings, so this method was soon abandoned.

Replaced by a novel new type of machine that is still in use today; whenever any representative speaks in the venue, the sound will be immediately picked up by the "microphone" installed in the venue, and then transmitted through a line to the ears of the translators sitting in a row of glass booths on the side of the venue. The efficiency of their work is truly amazing. Each of them must be able to understand the languages of seven countries and translate them fluently without hesitation. The speaker's speech is continuous, and their translated words are also continuous. Not only that, but each of them has some talent for speaking, and can express the central consciousness and tone of each representative's speech very appropriately. Everyone who has participated in the United Nations conference admires this skill immensely.

The voices of these seven interpreters are transmitted into seven microphones, then into seven amplifiers, and finally turned into radio waves, radiating from a copper wire around the ceiling using seven different wavelengths.

The receiver is even simpler, smaller than our ordinary camera, equipped with full receiving equipment and batteries, attached with a strap, which is the antenna, and does not need to be connected to anything. Representatives can hold it and listen while walking around. There is also a knob on it. No matter which country's representative stands up to speak, the listener only needs to turn its pointer to the language they can understand.

### Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation Disputes Arise from Land Returns Without Written Records

(Answered by Lawyer Jiang Pingfan)

Mr. Huang Zhongyi asks: Mr. A has seven mu of ancestral land. In 1937, due to a lack of people to cultivate it and owing two piculs of rent, he returned the land to the landlord. However, the landlord was momentarily confused and did not have him issue a land return receipt, and then immediately entrusted Mr. B to continue cultivating it. A year later, B no longer wanted to cultivate the land because it was not good. The landlord then entrusted Mr. C to cultivate it and issued a cultivation ticket. C has been cultivating and renting since 1939 for eleven years. Recently, A suddenly claimed land surface rights from C and forced him to stop cultivating. Please ask:

(1) Do C and A still have a relationship on the land surface? (2) Due to the return of rent and owed rent, does A still have land surface rights? (3) Is it valid not to have a written record at the time of the rent return? (4) Now that A is asking C to return the land surface, how should C deal with it? (5) After eleven years, A has not expressed any intention, and there were no words at the time of the initial rental. Can C directly reject it? (6) Is there any reason to refute the forced cessation of cultivation?

"Answer" (1) (2) C has been renting the land from the landlord and cultivating it for eleven years with a land ticket, so he should have obtained the right to rent the land. A and the landlord have already returned the rent, so there are no rights to speak of, and cannot claim rights on the grounds that the landlord did not take back the land ticket. (3) It is not necessary to have a written record at the time of the rent return. The fact that A has not cultivated for eleven years can prove it. (4) When A asks C to return the land surface, C can use the land ticket issued by the landlord to resist and reject it. (5) C can directly reject A's request. (6) If A forces the cessation of cultivation, he can be accused of hindering freedom.

### Clarification of School Enrollment Issues

Education Bureau answers Mr. Jin Yongjian

Regarding whether there are any remedial measures for the enrollment of graduates from unapproved secondary schools. After investigation, Mr. Wang's graduating school was only approved to open and was not formally registered. All schools that are approved to open but have not completed registration procedures are still unregistered schools. The student's enrollment has not been reported to this bureau for record, so there is no record to verify. If Mr. Wang was admitted to the university based on equivalent qualifications, then there should be no problem with the university enrollment. If he was only admitted to the university with a certificate, there is no other way except to (1) participate in the screening and (2) wait for the college to complete registration before applying for retroactive recognition of the qualifications of graduates before registration.
