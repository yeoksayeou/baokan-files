### Listening to the Peace Talk Report at the Legislative Yuan, Encouraging Representatives to Fulfill Their Mission, Shao Lizi Not Discouraged, Zhang Zhizhong Filled with Emotion, President Chiang States He Will Not Intervene in Politics

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 30th] Chief Representative of the Government's Peace Delegation, Zhang Zhizhong, flew back to Nanjing from Xikou around 3 p.m. on the 30th. After a short rest, he immediately went to the Legislative Yuan to attend a closed-door meeting to report on his visit with President Chiang. At 8 p.m., the representatives gathered at Zhang's private residence to discuss relevant matters, with personnel from the secretariat also participating. Zhang also reported on his trip to Xikou, and the meeting adjourned at 11 p.m. Zhang then accompanied Huang Shaohong to visit Acting President Li, reporting on the Xikou trip, not returning until midnight.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 30th] President Chiang has decided to adopt a completely non-interfering attitude towards the major peace plan, allowing Acting President Li and Premier He to decide and handle matters with full authority. President Chiang also stated that he is determined, as a private citizen, to fully support Acting President Li in achieving peace. President Chiang made this statement on the 29th when he met with Zhang Zhizhong, who was representing the Kuomintang and reporting to the President in Xikou on the peace talks. Zhang Zhizhong, after returning to Nanjing on the afternoon of the 30th, went to the Legislative Yuan to attend a closed-door meeting, reporting on his visit to Xikou. Zhang said: President Chiang in Xikou was touring the mountains and rivers, appearing relaxed and at ease. He stated that since he had already retired, he would not interfere in politics. In the past, he first advocated for peace, and now he sincerely hopes that everyone will work hard to complete it. When the President and Zhang went for a walk, facing the stream in front of the mountain, he happily told Zhang: "I haven't lived in my hometown for so long in over forty years. If the peace talks can succeed, the world can be at peace, and the people can live and work in peace, it would be like being an immortal to spend my remaining years in my hometown." His attitude was very relaxed and cheerful when he said this. Zhang also told the legislators that President Chiang has gained weight since his retirement, going from 118 pounds to 125 pounds. After learning of President Chiang's statement, the legislators expressed their infinite joy with enthusiastic applause. The closed-door meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 30th was held at 3 p.m. All six government peace representatives were invited to attend. Zhang Zhizhong and Shao Lizi each gave reports. Shao stated that while many outside believe he is pessimistic about the peace talks, he is not discouraged. The Chinese Communists insist on eight conditions, and the government's measures to benefit the peace talks have not been thoroughly implemented in the past two months, so the future of the peace talks is indeed difficult. However, he agreed to be a peace representative, which indicates that he is not discouraged. After Shao's report, more than ten legislators, including Hou Shaowen, Zhang Qianhua, Jiang Yiping, Hu Daoyuan, Huang Jianzhong, Yang Gongda, Yang Buping, Wu Chouren, Zhong Pusheng, and Cui Xueli, spoke one after another. Summarizing their opinions, in addition to encouraging the peace representatives to complete their mission, they also put forward the following hopes: (1) Both sides should first cease fire, (2) Maintain the people's freedom of life, (3) The people's standpoint should be the standpoint, and it should not only be the government's standpoint. (4) Concessions should be made. (5) Nationalization of the army, etc. (6) Peace should be fair and reasonable. After the legislators finished speaking, Zhang Zhizhong reported. Zhang first stated that the peace representatives were appointed by the government and should be guided and restrained by the government, but the government is also responding to the people's demands and striving for peace, and will accept the supervision and guidance of the Legislative Yuan at any time. The delegation will not abandon the common aspirations of the people and will do its best for the country and the nation. Zhang expressed that he could not bear to look back on the evolution of the peace talks over the past two years and the changing situation, and was filled with emotion. It is said that he participated in peace talks with the Chinese Communists two years ago, but his mood for going to Beiping for peace talks today is very different. Regarding the preparations for the peace talks, Zhang said that it is not convenient to announce anything before the negotiations. The specific counter-proposals to the Chinese Communists' eight conditions must also be kept secret. However, in abstract terms, such as the issues of the constitution and legal system, the Legislative and Supervisory Committees have collectively expressed their opinions on this, advocating that as long as peace can be achieved, no sacrifice should be spared. Since everyone has expressed this, the government should attach importance to everyone's opinions. Confiscating bureaucratic capital and reforming the land system have long been our consistent demands in the past. Even today, who would think of the wealthy, but this must have its methods. As for treasonous treaties, everyone opposes them. Abolishing treasonous treaties, I believe, will be supported by everyone, but what constitutes a treasonous treaty needs to be distinguished. These five items are not difficult. The other three items, punishing war criminals, reorganizing the army, and establishing a coalition government, are more difficult to resolve than the first five, but these difficulties are not insurmountable, and we should strive for a proper solution. Zhang's report lasted forty minutes. His attitude was relaxed and cheerful, interspersed with hearty laughter. The legislators responded with warm applause more than ten times in forty minutes. After Zhang's report, President of the Legislative Yuan, Tong Guanxian, also stood up to thank the peace representatives and wished them success in completing their mission and achieving peace. The meeting adjourned around 6 p.m. (The opinions of the Shanghai National Assembly Members Association and the National Peace Promotion Association on the peace talks are published on page two.)

### Secretariat Staff of the Peace Delegation, Lu Yuwen and Others Fly to Beiping Today, Representatives for Postal and Aviation Communications Fly North on the Same Plane

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 30th] A group of seventeen people, including the secretariat staff of the peace delegation and the representatives for postal and aviation communications, are scheduled to fly to Beiping from Nanjing on the morning of the 31st at 10 a.m. on a special plane provided by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC). The group will be led by Secretary-General Lu Yuwen and will include ten secretariat staff, five postal representatives, and one aviation representative. The plane will also carry several large boxes of reference materials and silver dollars for use. The delegation, its advisors, secretaries, and staff are scheduled to go to Beiping on the 1st. The list of advisors still needs to be approved at the political affairs meeting on the 31st, and will likely include Jiang Yong, Li Junlong, Jie Wu, and Mo Dehui. The government is taking a very cautious attitude towards the peace talks this time, so the preparation work is also very careful and thorough. The delegation members are also very cautious in their external communications and do not reveal any news that could affect the peace talks. In general, people have high hopes that the delegation's trip will ultimately be successful, and Zhang Zhizhong, who has always maintained confidence, is leading the entire team, which further increases the optimism of all parties regarding the peace talks. The delegation members have all expressed the spirit of "taking one step at a time, not asking about the harvest, only knowing how to cultivate," which is admirable and comforting. It is reported that the delegation's preparations are already in order, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) delegation's departure time and the number of its staff were notified on the 30th.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The representatives sent by the Directorate General of Posts to negotiate comprehensive postal communications with the CCP, Mei Yifan, Weng Haoying, Li Xiong, Shen Xin, and Wang Zhenbai, as well as the representative from CNAC to negotiate aviation communications, Lei Zuoren, and the representative from the aviation industry, Jin Shan, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane at noon on the 30th and are scheduled to fly to Beiping on the special plane with the secretariat staff of the government peace delegation on the 31st. The postal representatives going to Beiping will negotiate with the CCP on the following issues: (1) location of mail exchange, (2) types of packages, (3) principles of remittance, (4) uniform postage, (5) personnel safety, and other issues.

### Should the Legislative Yuan Suspend Meetings During the Peace Talks? Legislators Exchange Opinions Today

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 30th] Whether the Legislative Yuan should suspend meetings during the peace talks has become a major concern for most legislators. Some legislators are brewing a proposal for discussion by the General Assembly. The fourth informal meeting of legislators, originally scheduled for 3 p.m. on the 31st, has decided to focus on this issue and exchange opinions first. If meetings should be temporarily suspended, then the existing proposals must be quickly processed so that the meeting can be adjourned immediately.

### Li Junlong Flies to Nanjing

[Our Correspondent in Changsha, 30th] Li Junlong flew to Nanjing on the morning of the 30th. He stated that he was going to Beiping this time on orders to work for "the public will of the people." Li specifically denied rumors that Li Weihan and he were brothers, saying they were not "older brothers," but "school seniors." However, Li does have an older brother, Li Zhuoran, who joined the Communist Party and has not been in contact for twenty years.

### Yan Xishan and Bai Chongxi Visit Acting President Li for a Long Talk

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 30th] Yan Xishan had frequent visits on the 30th after arriving in Nanjing. He went to Chuanhougang at 9 a.m. to pay his respects to Acting President Li and had a long talk that lasted three hours, not leaving until 12 p.m. When Yan paid his respects to Acting President Li, Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi, who had just arrived in Nanjing from Wuhan on the 29th, also paid his respects and participated in the discussion. At 2 p.m. in the afternoon, Yan visited Premier He Yingqin, at 3 p.m. he visited Bai Chongxi, and at 4 p.m. he visited Yu Youren, returning to the Capital Hotel to rest at 5 p.m. At around 6 p.m., Premier He personally visited Yan at the Capital Hotel in return, and then Xu Yongchang and others came to visit.

### The Legislative Yuan Smoothly Passes the He Cabinet's Policy Guidelines, Only Four Members Questioned, Remaining Members Submit Questions in Writing

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 30th] Premier He Yingqin, accompanied by his cabinet members, attended the Legislative Yuan on the 30th to report on the policy guidelines. It passed the biggest difficulty since his inauguration with unexpected smoothness. As a rule, the questions posed by the legislators after the report of the policy guidelines by the newly appointed premier are extremely severe. Weng Wenhao, the first premier of the constitutional cabinet, was interrogated for three days. Sun Ke was exempted because he only made a supplementary report after announcing his resignation. However, He Yingqin only received questions from four people, and the remaining fifty or so people submitted their questions in writing, which He will answer in writing. The Legislative Yuan held the ninth meeting of the third session on the 30th. Chairman Tong Guanxian, He Yingqin, the heads of various ministries, the Chief of Staff, and the Commander of the Navy were all present on time. After the reporting of the items, the meeting began, and the premier and the heads of the ministries reported on the policy guidelines. He Yingqin calmly stepped onto the podium and read out the policy guidelines passed by the Political Council meeting on the 29th (full text on the left corner), which took twenty minutes to complete. Finally, He also modestly stated that he had always held military positions, and this time he took the post of Premier of the Executive Yuan, deciding to be pragmatic and realistic. The purpose of the above-mentioned guidelines is to achieve them, so he did not dare to make excessively high demands, hoping that the legislators would give guidance. After he finished speaking, he received a lot of applause. This was followed by a military report, in which Xu Yongchang and Gu Zhutong explained the verification of military strength, the improvement of conscription and treatment, the recent strength of both sides, the movement of the Communist army, and the situation of river defense, all of which were very concise. Gui Yongqing was also invited to attend and report on the Chongqing warship incident, saying that he had reported the facts and asked to be punished. After the break, the questioning began. Fifty-nine people requested to speak. Zhang Qingzhen spoke first, hoping for two points: (1) Abide by the spirit of the Constitution and respect the powers of the Legislative Yuan. Important decisions should be made after consulting the Legislative Yuan. (2) Guarantee personal freedom and remove obstacles to peace. (3) Truly achieve a responsible cabinet, stand up straight, and take responsibility. Gao Tingzi raised three doubts and disagreements about the policy guidelines: (1) Does the so-called transportation industry no longer (completely) rely on subsidies from the national treasury, but still needs (partially) subsidize? (2) In addition to Guan Yuan, the tax revenue has revived the (tax Yuan) unit system, with too many tricks, and the people do not know what to do. (3) The technical problems in the implementation of the property tax should not cause nationwide disturbances, and should truly make the rich people of the country pay. He also hoped that He would employ people based on their talents and that the policy guidelines could be fulfilled, and reforms must produce results. Zhou Yong urged He to pay attention to prevent opportunistic bureaucrats from mixing in, resulting in corrupt and incompetent politics. Wu Shipeng advocated: (1) Peace is for the government to represent the people in negotiating peace, and there should be minimum conditions during negotiations, which should be finalized by the Legislative Yuan. (2) Spiritual education for soldiers is important and should still be emphasized. In the economic field, speculation by banks should be cracked down on. Then, Li Xiatian's written opinion on the issue of military reorganization was read out. The legislators argued that the written opinions should be sent to Premier He for reference and did not need to be read out. By then, it was almost noon. The chairman consulted the opinions of the audience. There were still fifty-four people who had not had a chance to speak. Whether to extend the time, most legislators felt that time would never allow everyone to speak, and mainly advocated that all be changed to written form and sent to Premier He for compilation and answers. After a vote, the meeting was adjourned at 12 o'clock, and He Yingqin and his cabinet members also left the venue at the same time.

### More Than 3,000 Faculty and Students of Anhui University

### The Chinese Communist Army Currently Has a Total Strength of Approximately Four Million, Will Cross the Yangtze River in Early Summer if Peace Talks Fail, Gu Zhutong Reports on Military Affairs at the Legislative Yuan Meeting

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 30th] Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong reported at the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 30th that the current strength of the Communist army, including the first-line troops, second-line troops, and militia, is approximately four million people. Gu said: At the end of 1947, the Communist army had a total of more than 1.9 million people. By the end of 1948, it had increased to more than 3.55 million people. This year, it has reached more than 3.95 million people. Its field army has a total of 106 columns (now changed to armies), 1.7 million people, and the military region troops have 770,000 people, totaling 2.5 million people. The second-line troops and militia total more than 1 million people. There are approximately 120,000 communist troops south of the Yangtze River, of which 1.54 million belong to Lin Biao, 780,000 to Nie Rongzhen and Xu Xiangqian, 270,000 to Peng Dehuai, 730,000 to Chen Yi, 470,000 to Liu Bocheng, and 120,000 to local communist troops, distributed in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Guangdong and other places. There are also more than 10,000 people near the capital and Xiaguan. When Gu mentioned the issue of the Communist army crossing the Yangtze River, he said: From a purely military point of view, the deployment and preparation for crossing the river have been largely completed, so that they can put forward harsh conditions to the government during the peace talks. If the peace talks fail, they will blame the government. According to the previous deployment of the Communist army, Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi are responsible for the east of Wuhu, Chen Geng is responsible for the west of Wuhu, and Nie Rongzhen and Xu Xiangqian are on the west side of the Pinghan Railway. According to the information currently available, the Communist army may cross the Yangtze River in early summer, that is, in April or May. Regarding the National Army's defense of the Yangtze River, Gu also mentioned that the defense of the Yangtze River is the responsibility of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters and the Central China Military and Political Commander's Office. The Tang Headquarters is responsible for Pukou to Shanghai, and the Eighth Pacification Zone is responsible for above Pukou. At present, most of the ports in Jiangbei have been closed, and the National Army has deployed a tight defense in Jiangnan. Bridgehead fortifications have been set up in Jiangbei to cover the navy's patrol of the river surface, and the air force is also conducting extensive reconnaissance. This deployment and preparation, I believe, can be consolidated day by day. If the Communist army wants to cross the Yangtze River, relying only on wooden boats, when the river is rising, the wind and waves are very large, and it is not easy to cross the Yangtze River by wooden boats. The National Army will absolutely strictly guard the Yangtze River to conduct peace talks with the Chinese Communist Party.

### Fierce Battles on the Southern Section of the Pinghan Railway, Zhumadian Falls

Communist Army That Attacked Wangkongdian Was Defeated

[Our Correspondent in Huayuan, 30th] Fierce fighting broke out at Wangjiadian (118 kilometers from Hankou), 16 kilometers north of Huayuan on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, at 3 a.m. on the 30th. A part of the Communist Army's Jianghan Column, about 5,000 people, invaded the town of Wangjiadian and moved in groups to attack the railway station. The elite troops of Zhang Gan's Army Corps, which rushed to the aid of Wangjiadian, completely defeated the two regiments of the Communist Army that had infiltrated the town of Wangjiadian at 1 p.m. today and recaptured the high ground on the north side of the railway station.

[Our Correspondent in Xinyang, 30th] A regiment of the New First Brigade of the Communist Army and more than 1,000 local communist troops from Suiping and Biyang sneaked into Zhumadian at 10 a.m. this morning.

### The Battle of Anqing Reaches Its Climax, Communist Army Reinforcements Are Repelled Despite Repeated Attacks

Several River Boats Were Shot at by the Communist Army While Passing Through Huayangzhen

[Our Correspondent in Wuhu, 30th] The battle of Anqing has entered its eighth day, and the war has also reached its climax. The three armies of the Communist Army's Chen Geng Department, after repeated reinforcements, launched another full-scale attack on the suburbs of the city on the night of the 29th. Among them, the attacks in the agricultural school and Qipanshan areas in the northeast of the city were particularly fierce. After the arrival of reinforcements from the sea and land routes, the National Army also fought back bravely. After a fierce battle until the morning of the 30th, a large formation of the National Air Force rushed to join the battle, and the Communist Army finally retreated after suffering more than 3,000 casualties. As of the evening of the 30th, the National Army still secured the original positions of Wulidun, Fenghuangshan, Qipanshan, and other places. The so-called abandonment of the airfield is obviously a misreport. In addition: The offensive of the Communist Army on the sandbars of Shangguan and Tiexin in the middle of the Yangtze River west of Anqing has been frustrated since the 30th under the fierce fire net formed by the joint land and sea forces of the National Army.

[Our Correspondent in Wuhu, 30th] External communications in Anqing are unhindered today, and the rumor of being interrupted is inaccurate.

[Our Correspondent in Hankou, 30th] Military information: The battle of Anqing has entered a decisive stage. Part of the defending army of the city has moved to the suburbs to prepare to encircle and attack the Communist Army. According to transportation sources here: After Anqing became tense, the Jiangtai ship that went there to pick up non-combatants and the Jiangshun ship that was preparing to sail to Shanghai both departed from Anqing yesterday afternoon and sailed west from Qishou, and when they arrived at Huayangzhen north of Wangjiang, they were suddenly shot at by the Communist Army on the shore. A total of two people were killed and one injured on the Jiangshun ship, and there were no losses on the Jiangtai ship. In addition, eight people were killed and one injured on a certain ship of the Dada Company. The details are being investigated.

[Our Correspondent in Chongqing, 30th] Aviation industry news: Yangtze River shipping has not been completely blocked. The Minzu ship left Yichang for Shanghai today. Also, the Minsheng Company's No. 1 oil tanker left Nanjing on the 30th and arrived at Qiugang near Anqing at 12 a.m., continuing west.

[Our Correspondent in Suzhou, 30th] The political work office of the "7061" unit of the local garrison announced that on the evening of the 27th of this month, 21 local communist boats were discovered at the Linkou of Beishe in Taicang County. Each boat was carrying ten soldiers attempting to land forcibly, and they were repelled by the troops. In addition, on the night of the 28th, more than ten communist boats, full of communist troops, shot at the south bank with rifles at the Liuhekou northeast of Taicang, and they were also defeated by the troops.

### Policy Guidelines of the Executive Yuan

1.  Preamble

At this critical juncture of national peril, Ying Qin has been entrusted with the position of President of the Executive Yuan. With limited talent but significant responsibilities, I deeply fear being unequal to the task. However, having received the nomination of the Acting President and the approval of your esteemed Yuan, I must reluctantly accept this weighty mission and devote all my efforts to it. I have primarily been involved in military affairs and have rarely concerned myself with politics. However, upon observing the current situation, I believe that striving for peace is essential to safeguard the foundation of the nation; political reform is essential to reverse decline and rectify long-standing issues; military reform is essential to defend the country and protect the people; and financial reform is essential to stabilize the people's livelihood.

Since the victory, the flames of war have not ceased, the nation's strength has been almost exhausted, and the suffering of the people has deepened. Therefore, seeking peace is the unanimous desire of the people nationwide. It is imperative to seek peace with the utmost sincerity and tolerance to solidify the foundation of the nation.

In recent years, the social atmosphere has deteriorated, manifested in politics as perfunctoriness, corruption, and incompetent venality. To reverse decline and rectify long-standing issues and restore the social atmosphere, it is imperative to reform politics with the utmost courage and decisiveness, eradicate old corruption, and make a fresh start with the people.

After prolonged warfare during the War of Resistance, the organizational structure of the military has expanded, making the supply of military provisions more challenging. Consequently, the official number of personnel often exceeds the actual number, and discipline has not been fully rectified, leading to a decline in military reputation and morale. It is imperative to verify personnel numbers and actively reorganize with the utmost determination and effort, ensuring a lean and well-supplied force with strict discipline to fulfill the responsibility of defending the country and protecting the people.

Today, the nation's finances and financial system are severely depleted, and the national economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. Compounded by declining currency confidence and rising prices, the majority of the people are unable to meet their basic needs for food and warmth, let alone maintain their minimum standard of living. It is imperative to reform with the utmost perseverance and conviction, aiming to streamline revenue and expenditure, maintain currency confidence, and increase production, so that finance, financial system, and economy can closely coordinate and mutually reinforce each other, ultimately achieving stability in the people's livelihood. The aforementioned matters are all pressing priorities. Other administrative affairs will be gradually improved based on their relative urgency. I hereby present the policy guidelines for this year, outlining the tasks that must be undertaken and can be implemented: As the ancient saying goes, "Good governance lies not in excessive pronouncements." I can only be diligent and pragmatic, seek truth from facts, and strive to navigate these difficult times with utmost sincerity. I hope that the esteemed members of your Yuan will provide guidance and assistance, contributing to collective wisdom and effort to achieve peace and national construction. This is not only my personal heartfelt prayer.

Editorial

### Regarding Production Loans

After the He cabinet's policy guidelines were approved at the Provisional Political Affairs Meeting on the 29th, Premier He presented a policy report to the Legislative Yuan yesterday morning. The report placed particular emphasis on support for production in the areas of finance, financial system, economy, and transportation, and four measures will be adopted: (1) prudently provide production loans; (2) adopt a key-point approach to increase production; (3) encourage people to invest in productive enterprises; and (4) develop rural sideline occupations and handicrafts. Today, when the national economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, the He cabinet's adoption of only the above four measures to achieve the goals of stabilizing the economy and ensuring the people's livelihood is, of course, a significant challenge. However, the thirsty person easily craves a drink, and the hungry person easily craves food. When the nation's productive enterprises are currently in a state of stagnation, hearing Premier He's policy report, that the government is determined to do its best to support productive enterprises, it is impossible not to regard this as a ray of light in the darkness, especially regarding the expectation of the government's "prudently providing production loans," which is the most urgent.

In recent years, the widespread scarcity of funds for our country's productive enterprises has been a major factor hindering industrial progress. However, the government's intermittent loans over the years have also provided considerable assistance to the struggling industrial sector. Looking back on the industrial loans issued in recent years, although there are distinctions in name such as production loans, emergency industrial loans, order loans, small industrial loans, and the purchase of finished products, in reality, they are nothing more than temporary, low-interest loans provided around the end of the year to meet urgent needs. Recently, in addition to the authorities issuing ten measures for order loans, they are also in the process of drafting measures for production loans. Before these measures are announced, we would like to propose several principles for the reference of the financial authorities.

First, the loan recipients: Are they truly industries related to democratic national defense? Do their products meet the standards of general industry? Do they truly feel a lack of funds? Are their operating conditions meeting normal requirements? All of these should be carefully investigated in advance.

Second, the loan criteria: Strict regulations should be established, with all decisions based on the actual conditions of the factories. Loans should not be given as gifts due to personal connections or the influence of a few special individuals, leaving the majority of factories that truly need funds unable to obtain them.

Third, the loan supervision: In addition to the Central Bank's Rediscount Committee making decisions on loans, it must also authorize and hold the lending banks accountable for seriously assessing the use of funds by the factories that received loans, and comparing the production situation before and after the loans. Only then can the prosperity of productive enterprises be promoted and the inertia of manufacturers relying on loans be eliminated.

Fourth, the loan collateral: It is best to avoid using raw materials, finished products, and semi-finished products, because the purpose of the loan is solely to help manufacturers alleviate the shortage of working capital in the production process. If raw materials and semi-finished products are used as collateral, it is tantamount to preventing them from re-producing, and even promoting their excuse for hoarding, harming the entire national economy, from the saying "It is better to do business than to manufacture, and it is better to hoard than to do business." Therefore, I personally advocate that loans should be secured with real estate and machinery. In addition, in order to ensure the safety of the loan, it can also be stipulated separately that guarantees be provided by the trade association and two reputable shops, along with the guarantee.

Fifth, the loan term: It should still be stipulated separately based on the nature of heavy industry and light industry. Under the current circumstances, with the value of currency fluctuating daily, it is difficult to lend all of the long-term funds needed by factories. Therefore, we advocate that loans for heavy industry should still be for a term of three months, and loans for light industry should still be for a term of two months. When they are due, the decision to roll over or recall them should be made separately based on the effectiveness of the factory that received the loan.

Sixth, the loan interest rate: It should not be excessively low, and it is most appropriate to be close to the market rate, because the overall environment is such that it is not easy for the country to extract a portion of its strength to lend to factories in the midst of great difficulty. If the interest rate is too low, it will inevitably create benefits for a few people, which is also unreasonable.

Seventh, the loan procedures: They should be as simple as possible. Do not let factories feel a headache when they see complex forms, and do not teach factories that when they receive a loan, they feel that the purpose has changed from when they applied, and that it is not of much help. Therefore, in order to save time, many delays in the transfer of agencies should be reduced as much as possible. It is best for factories to apply for loans directly to the Central Bank's Rediscount Committee, which may be faster in terms of procedures.

Eighth, the source of loan funds: It must not rely on the issuance of currency again, increasing the burden on the entire nation. It is most appropriate if loans can be handled based on the situation of each national bank's own position (including the Central Bank itself).

The eight principles mentioned above are indeed what the government authorities cannot ignore when prudently providing production loans. Currently, we certainly sympathize with the difficult situation of the industrial sector, but when the majority of the people are still struggling on the hunger line, we cannot help but pay attention to obtaining the maximum efficiency of the funds flowing out of the country. It is best to issue more fixed-order loans and effectively control materials; otherwise, it is also necessary to agree with the relevant trade associations in advance that they have the right to designate the destination of their products, in order to regulate other needed places, thereby stabilizing the supply relationship.

In short, today the country and the nation's productive enterprises are both in a precarious situation. We deeply hope that everyone will understand the difficulties of the times and follow the correct principles to handle matters. The personnel handling the loans should be particularly honest and conscientious, so that the nation's productive enterprises can all benefit from the real benefits. At the same time, the industrial sector must also work hard to improve the quality and quantity of products. In this way, the production loans organized by the authorities today will not fall through!

This is truly a major event related to the nation and the people, and is by no means to be monopolized by the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. For the government, in particular, it must not forget its own position, which was produced by the National Assembly last year in accordance with the Constitution. If the Constitution is ignored first, and the National Assembly is disregarded, may I ask what position and what power will you rely on to negotiate with the Communist Party? At today's meeting, this Association unanimously believes that in this peace talk, the government should strive for equal and comprehensive peace within a reasonable and legal scope, and what must be adhered to should be: (1) political democracy, (2) economic equality, (3) social security, (4) freedom of life, and other four major principles. As for the necessity of all troops being owned by the state and the necessity of protecting basic human rights, these are even more matters of course and cannot be compromised in any way. The undersigned also believe that any amendments to the Constitution and the political system are absolutely within the jurisdiction of the National Assembly, and no one should be allowed to overstep their authority. In particular, it is proposed that the government convene a temporary meeting of the National Assembly immediately in accordance with the National Assembly's resolution last year to make the final decision.

Shanghai Liaison Association of National Assembly Representatives, knocking [with respect], Yin Yan Two."

[Associated Press, Washington, 29th] It was learned on the 29th that two minority party reports requesting comprehensive aid to the democratic forces in China will be submitted to the House of Representatives in a few days. The first report is being drafted by Republican Congressman Walter Judd and Congressman Judd. They intend to protest against the "piecemeal" passage of the foreign aid bill and urge comprehensive economic and military assistance to the Chinese Nationalist government. The other two, Fulton and Javits, want to give aid to any independent and democratic factions in China, not limited to the Kuomintang, and emphasize economic rather than military support. These two reports will be submitted as "minority opinions" to the House bill extending the Economic Cooperation Act. A member of the Foreign Affairs Committee told the Associated Press that the majority party report on China in the Foreign Affairs Committee was submitted on the 28th. The report supports the extension of aid to China, but opposes large-scale appropriations pending a "comprehensive review" of the situation in the Far East. The member said that in any case, the committee is expected to design a comprehensive plan for China's recovery during the current congressional session. Congressman Judd told the Associated Press that "unless the Communist Party completely controls China in the spring, this congressional session will definitely have an aid-to-China bill." He also said that even if the Communist Party completely controls China, he will advocate a bill to support the government in exile so that the democratic forces can actively resist the Communist Party.

### Opinions Offered by the Harmony Promotion Association, Telegraphing a Request for Adoption by Both the Government and the Chinese Communists

[Central News Agency, this city] The National Peace Promotion Association, considering that peace talks are about to begin, has specifically put forward three opinions and telegraphed a request for adoption by both the central government and the Chinese Communists. The original telegram is recorded as follows: To President Li, Premier He, and all peace talk representatives of the government in Nanjing; To Chairman Mao and all peace talk representatives of the Chinese Communist Party in Beiping: We are pleased to hear that representatives from both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will begin peace talks tomorrow to resolve suspicions and restore amity. This opportunity must not be lost. Our association has repeatedly telegraphed appeals to both sides to immediately issue cease-fire orders to demonstrate sincerity. However, recent rumors indicate that the artillery fire along the Yangtze River is intensifying. How can this inspire trust in the people? This is the first matter that we ask you to clarify. The content of the peace talks is crucial to the survival and interests of all people. Furthermore, national sovereignty belongs to the people. Therefore, in addition to the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, representatives from popular opinion institutions should participate in the peace talks, and reporters from both sides should be allowed to freely gather news and disclose it at any time to demonstrate frankness and impartiality. This is the second matter that we ask you to adopt. As for the Constitution, it is the fundamental law of the country. Even if it can be amended according to the law, it must never be arbitrarily discarded. Freedom is the basic right of the people, and human rights should be respected by any government. The political democratization, economic socialization, and nationalization of the military, which were previously proposed in our telegram, are not only the principles of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference in past years but also the common desire of the people throughout the country. These principles should still be adhered to in this peace talk without change. This is the third matter that we ask you to uphold. In summary, if you truly wish to end the war and make peace, everything should be based on obeying public opinion and respecting the law. Otherwise, without proper principles and legal safeguards, chaos will only increase, and how can we hope to see peace and stability again? We are specifically telegraphing to ask you to set aside your personal opinions, be calm, and plan for the long-term peace and stability of the country. We would be most fortunate. The National Peace Promotion Association, Yin Xian.

### Executive Yuan's Policy Guidelines, Continued from Page One

B. Regarding Military Affairs:

1.  Frontline troops will maintain their existing defensive lines and preserve the current situation to facilitate the smooth progress of peace talks.

2.  Adopt a policy of elite troops, reducing the number of military personnel to the minimum necessary to adapt to the current situation. All equipment, training, soldiers, and organization should be refined, new, and practical.

3.  Increase the salaries and benefits of officers and soldiers to ensure they can maintain a minimum standard of living. Subsidies for food, forage, office expenses, travel expenses, operating expenses, and equipment expenses must meet actual needs.

4.  Implement transparency in personnel matters, finances, and opinions. Promote a spirit of verification and rigorously conduct reviews at all levels. Rewards and punishments must be fair and consistent, avoiding hypocrisy, perfunctoriness, self-deception, and affectation. Ensure that orders from above are carried out below, and information from below reaches the top.

5.  Adjust the organization of the Ministry of National Defense, streamline non-essential units, and reduce excessive personnel to improve the effectiveness of command, supervision, and communication. The separation of planning and execution of business must also be redefined to ensure harmony and connection.

6.  Improve the conscription system. Conscription agencies should be integrated into local administrative agencies to specialize responsibilities and save manpower. In addition, strengthen local people's self-defense organizations to ensure an ample supply of soldiers and facilitate conscription and demobilization.

C. Regarding Fiscal and Monetary Affairs:

1.  Land taxes will be returned to local control, and a portion of national taxes will be allocated for local collection. Except for remote and impoverished provinces, the central government will no longer provide subsidies.

2.  Various fees for transportation and public utilities will be calculated based on cost and adjusted regularly to achieve self-sufficiency and no longer rely entirely on subsidies from the national treasury.

3.  Customs import duties will be calculated in Customs Gold Units (關元). A fixed ratio will be established between Customs Gold Units and foreign currencies. Gold Yuan Certificates (金圓劵) will be used to purchase and pay customs duties and will not circulate on the market.

4.  Establish a "Tax Unit" system to ensure tax revenue and avoid delays and losses in payment. All taxes, except customs duties, will be calculated and paid in Tax Units. Each Tax Unit will be equivalent to one-tenth of a gram of gold by the market system. Taxpayers will purchase with Gold Yuan Certificates, which will be used exclusively for paying taxes and will not circulate on the market.

5.  Levy property taxes to have the wealthy contribute, in accordance with the demands of the people throughout the country.

6.  Provide production loans, giving priority to industries producing daily necessities to facilitate the purchase of raw materials and foreign exchange settlement, to increase production and cultivate tax revenue.

7.  The free buying and selling of gold and silver will be permitted. The Central Bank may also buy and sell gold and silver to stabilize market prices and currency values.

8.  Silver dollars will be allowed to circulate. The government will procure silver and mint silver dollars to increase the amount in circulation and gradually consolidate the currency system.

9.  Encourage exports and remittances from overseas Chinese to increase the source of foreign exchange.

10. Establish cost-of-living deposit accounts or other value-preserving deposits to protect the people from losses due to currency devaluation.

D. Regarding Economic and Transportation Affairs:

1.  Increase production, adopting a focus on key areas. The types of products to be increased will be mainly daily necessities, important industrial raw materials, and import and export goods. For domestic sales, attention will be paid to improving living standards while saving labor and materials. For exports, efforts will be made to standardize products to meet the needs of the international market.

2.  Encourage private investment in production enterprises.

3.  Develop rural sideline occupations and handicrafts to compensate for the lack of equipment and power.

4.  Improve the transportation system and encourage exports to enrich the national economy. The scope of imports will be appropriately relaxed, provided it does not violate the principles of saving foreign exchange and protecting domestic production. Luxury goods and semi-luxury goods should still be prohibited from import.

5.  Actively rectify land, water, and air transportation operations, improve transportation efficiency, maintain normal order, facilitate travel for the people, and promote the exchange of goods in various parts of the country.

6.  Actively promote and encourage various privately operated transportation enterprises.

Mr. Acheson said that the talks will begin on the 31st, and Bevin and others will participate. In addition, "multiple meetings" may be held before and after the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty. Acheson also emphasized that special attention will be paid to the Berlin issue. Mr. Acheson said that the countries will discuss how to permanently prevent Germany from becoming a threat to world peace again, and at the same time, they will discuss how to make Germany a constructive and peaceful European nation again. Mr. Acheson said that ten countries are currently willing to join the treaty. The foreign ministers of these ten countries will hold a meeting this Saturday, at which the text of the treaty will be finalized and the establishment of a reception organization responsible for implementing the treaty will be considered.

At this point in Mr. Acheson's speech, news came that the Portuguese government had decided to participate in the treaty, bringing the number of participating countries to eleven.

The White House also revealed that President Truman will deliver a speech when the North Atlantic Treaty is signed next Monday. Mr. Acheson also said at the meeting that he had met with Italian Foreign Minister Sforza yesterday, who had put forward some opinions on European unification and had discussed the Italian political situation over the past two years. Mr. Acheson said that the issue of the former Italian colonies will be discussed again in the coming days, but Mr. Acheson did not elaborate on this.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th] French Foreign Minister Schuman is scheduled to leave Paris tonight and fly to Washington, D.C. to attend the signing ceremony of the Atlantic Treaty on April 4. He will be accompanied by M. Maheu, Director of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 30th Broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin arrived here on the "Queen Mary" in preparation for attending the signing ceremony of the North Atlantic Treaty. As Bevin left the ship, someone threw a tomato at him. The police immediately arrested him for disturbing the peace. When asked if the Atlantic Treaty needed to be fulfilled, he replied, "Of course," and said that this treaty proclaims to the world that democracy will finally unite in times of crisis. When a reporter asked Gromyko, the chief representative of the Soviet Union who arrived on the same ship, Mr. Gromyko replied that he would not make any formal statements. The reporter then asked Bevin again if he anticipated the result of the North Atlantic Treaty to be peace or war. Mr. Bevin replied, "If we are attacked, we can certainly take action quickly, but we would rather take steady and slow steps to cultivate our strength. I am not afraid of early attacks. If we want to maintain peace, it depends on how united people are." Other representatives of various countries who came to the United States on the same ship included Yugoslav Foreign Minister Popovic, Belgian Prime Minister Spaak, Luxembourg Foreign Minister Bech, and Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker.

### Syrian Army Launches Lightning Coup; Government Overthrown, All Cabinet Members Arrested; Generally Believed to Be a Prelude to Realizing Greater Syria

[United Press, Amman, 30th] Syrian Army Chief of Staff and Commander-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie Colonel Zaim launched a lightning coup on the evening of the 29th, arresting government officials, issuing strict martial law, and warning that anyone carrying firearms without authorization would be executed on the spot. A statement signed by the "Armed Forces Headquarters" and broadcast by the Damascus Radio Station in the Syrian capital stated that Prime Minister al-Azm and all cabinet ministers had been arrested. (There are conflicting reports about the whereabouts of President al-Quwatli. Reports from Beirut said that he was arrested along with cabinet members, while reports from Cairo said that he had fled to Lebanon.)

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 30th Broadcast: Damascus reports that the Syrian army has arrested a large number of officials after taking over the government and stated that it will hold civic elections to decide on the members of the new government. According to all indications, the purpose of this coup is clearly to obstruct Syria's reconciliation with Israel. There was no violent action when the army took over this afternoon, and the country was as peaceful as ever. Army Chief of Staff Zaim, the main leader of the coup, told reporters that this takeover of the government is temporary, pending the establishment of a new democratic regime. Zaim also said that he is negotiating with Khalil, the Syrian representative to the United Nations and chairman of the Syrian Parliament, to immediately establish a legitimate new government. Another report said that Asseily, another Syrian representative to the United Nations, is responsible for organizing the new government. Zaim also said that the army's action is purely an internal affair and has no foreign influence whatsoever. Zaim also warned that if anyone attempts to covet Syrian territory and sovereignty, the army will take decisive action.

[Reuters, Amman, 30th] Damascus Radio broadcast that Syrian Army Commander-in-Chief Colonel Zaim has assumed the position of dictator and established a military regime in Syria. Colonel Zaim told the Syrian people through the station, stating that his seizure of power was due to the worsening situation and to expel those who claim to be national elements. This emergency measure is necessary until a democratic government is established in Syria. The station also published another proclamation issued by Zaim, announcing martial law throughout the country and implementing traffic control in all cities and towns throughout the country from 6:00 a.m. local time until the notice is lifted. Syria has a population of 3.2 million and is one of the more intelligent Arab countries. Recently, the country's army has expressed great dissatisfaction with the government's signing of a truce agreement with Israel.

[United Press, Cairo, 30th] Well-informed political figures say that the coup in Syria may be a prelude to King Abdullah of Transjordan's long-cherished Greater Syria ambitions. The Arab Bureau in London said, "This is just the beginning of similar events within Arab countries. This is clearly a direct result of the Palestine catastrophe."

### Johnson Will Devote Himself to Unifying the Three Branches of the U.S. Military

Bureaucratic Branches and Agencies of the Military to Be Merged and Eliminated

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 29th] The new Secretary of Defense Johnson declared at his first reception for reporters on the 29th that the United States will take two measures to accelerate the unification of the American armed forces. These two measures are: (1) to concentrate the various departments of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force in the military headquarters in Washington, D.C., and (2) to eliminate and merge the 800 committees of the overlapping branches as soon as possible. Johnson announced that he is determined to entrust Mcnerney, the current Chief of the Air Force Materiel Command, with the task of handling the various tasks of adjusting the Department of Defense that he has planned. Johnson said that after Congress passes a bill granting the Department of Defense the necessary power to unify the Army, Navy, and Air Force, there will be a large number of personnel changes.

### Drafting Military Aid Plan

Barker Appointed as Special Assistant

[Report from this newspaper] Washington, 30th Broadcast: Acheson announced at a press conference that he has appointed Barker as a special assistant to draft the military aid plan. Mr. Barker is a well-known physicist. Regarding the content of the military aid draft, Acheson said that the draft may include a special authorization for all the funds needed for a one-year plan. The duration of the plan is probably more than one year, but the amount requested for approval is only for one year. Acheson also said that under the current plan, the bill does not designate the countries that will receive assistance. He said that the meeting on Saturday will discuss the organization of the committee to implement the treaty. He also said that after Truman delivers a speech at the signing ceremony, the foreign ministers of various countries will speak in succession and then sign one by one in alphabetical order. The final procedures for the signing ceremony are still awaiting approval from the foreign ministers of various countries and President Truman.

### U.S. Warns Eastern European Representatives to the World Peace Congress to Leave the U.S. as Soon as Possible; The Representatives Have Not Yet Abandoned Their Plan to Travel Around the Country

[United Press, Newark, New Jersey, 29th] The State Department tonight prevented twelve representatives from communist countries attending the New York World Peace Congress from traveling around the country.

### Industrial Representatives Travel to Beijing Together: Submitting Opinions on North-South Bartering, Carrying an Outline of Bartering Methods, etc., Presented to President He

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Industrial Association, recognizing the increasingly urgent need to realize North-South bartering, previously appointed ten representatives in the last joint meeting of directors and supervisors to go to Beijing to present their opinions to the central authorities. It is now learned that these representatives have been discussing matters for several days and have formulated a bartering outline based on the opinions of various industries, as well as a list of items to be exchanged. This bartering outline and list of goods were approved at yesterday afternoon's meeting of the Industrial Association's standing directors. Besides some representatives already in Beijing, Liu Hongsheng, Pan Shihao, Tian Heqing, Hong Nianzu, Cai Xintao, Hu Xiyuan, Yao Shushen, and seven others set off for Beijing last night. They will present to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Communications the current crisis facing the industrial sector and the need for North-South bartering. If this proposal can be approved by the authorities, the North-South bartering plan can be realized in the short term. The full text of the Industrial Association's resolution to present to President He is recorded below:

We believe that the operation of industry and commerce in various regions depends entirely on the exchange of goods and the mutual exchange of goods, so that they can prosper and grow and avoid suffocation. The prosperity or decline of the social economy also rises and falls with this. Since last winter's Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign, the abandonment of Jiangbei, and the partial peaceful settlement of Tianjin and Beijing, Shanghai's industrial sector has been facing increasingly difficult circumstances due to the lack of raw materials and the shrinking sales area. All of Anshan and Longyan's iron, Kailuan, China Xing, and Huainan's coal, Fengyang and Xuchang's tobacco leaves, Tianjin and Yongli's alkali, peanuts and soybeans needed by the oil pressing industry, cotton and wool needed by the textile industry, pig bristles and animal bones needed by the toothbrush industry, raw hides needed by the leather industry, etc., are all restricted by region and cannot come south. Furthermore, products manufactured in Shanghai, such as cloth, wool, dyes, medicines, machinery, tires, rubber shoes, bicycles, light bulbs, flashlights, paint, towels, sheets, underwear, enamelware, aluminumware, silk, bakelite products, seasonings, soap, tea, hardware, paper, and various household chemicals, etc., have traditionally relied on North China and Jiangbei as their main markets, but now they cannot be transported for sale. Although they may be nearby, there are no merchants coming and going, and trade is completely cut off. Our industrial sector is in a difficult situation. On the one hand, we feel that fuel and raw materials cannot be obtained, and on the other hand, sales are shrinking, finished products are piling up, and capital turnover is sluggish, forcing us to reduce work and production. However, normal expenses cannot be reduced, and losses are increasing. Those with a slightly thicker foundation find it difficult to manage, and those with smaller scales have to stop operating. If this continues, we will all perish together. Fortunately, you have taken over the Executive Yuan and are committed to peace and economic recovery. You must have been deeply considering the difficulties and hardships of the industrial sector. Feeling the urgent need to ourselves, our industrial sector has convened meetings several times to discuss and study conducting bartering and trial trade with North China and Jiangbei, so that the products of both sides can be mutually circulated. All exchanged goods are limited to the needs of the people and industrial raw materials, so as to avoid goods being滞留 on the ground, being used by neighboring countries, or bypassing Hong Kong Island, wasting physical resources. In the past, our exchange of flour for their coal has been effective, and shipping industry leaders have contacted them to negotiate shipping, which is also showing promise. Recent reports of the opening of telecommunications, postal services, and remittances are all being carried out one after another. If the trade issue can be carried out along with it, not only will the livelihoods of the more than eighty industries and more than 12,000 factories belonging to this association and the hundreds of thousands of employees be guaranteed, but also the peace that you have been seeking day and night can be achieved with favorable progress. If this matter can be approved in principle, concrete measures should be formulated in terms of implementation technology to ensure thoroughness and facilitate progress. We have now prepared an outline of North-South bartering methods and a list of North-South cargo names and quantities, and the association has appointed representatives Liu Hongsheng, Shu Yunzhang, Yang Guanbei, Liu Piji, Pan Shihao, Tian Heqing, Hong Nianzu, Cai Xintao, Hu Xiyuan, and Yao Shushen to go to Beijing to present them for your inspection, hoping that you will grant them adoption and implementation. We are waiting for your orders with utmost urgency. Respectfully presented to He, President of the Executive Yuan.

### Rent Standards Can Be Determined: Conveners of Participating Groups Have Exchanged Opinions: Visiting the Mayor Today to Suggest Maximizing Reduction

[Our Newspaper's Report] The issue of rent standards in this city, after several studies by the Land Administration Bureau and the Municipal Government Councilors' Office, has reached the final stage and can be announced after discussion and decision at tomorrow's Municipal Government meeting. Councilors Jiang Hao, Zhang Zhongyuan, Chen Peide, Ma Junshuo, Zhou Lianze, Zhu Yakui, Ye Xianggao, Zhang Xuelian, Yao Baozhen, etc., agreed with Mayor Wu yesterday to visit Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government at 4:00 PM today, representing the Land Administration, Social Affairs, and Regulations Committees of the Municipal Council, and the Tenants' General Federation, respectively, to contribute opinions on determining rent standards to Mayor Wu.

Previously Determined Plan: Divided into Five Levels

It is reported that the rent standards previously formulated by the Councilors' Office are divided into five levels: (1) For pre-war rents below 50 yuan, 20% (i.e., 10 yuan) is taken, multiplied by the current cost of living index, as the current rent. (2) For pre-war rents between 51 yuan and 100 yuan, 15% is taken as the base. (3) For pre-war rents between 101 yuan and 200 yuan, 20% is taken as the base. (4) For pre-war rents between 201 yuan and 300 yuan, 25% is taken as the base. (5) For pre-war rents above 300 yuan, 30% is taken as the base. After the above rent standards were set, both the Municipal Council and the Tenants' General Federation believed that they were too high and difficult for citizens to bear, so they suggested that the Municipal Government calculate them at half of the original standard. Mayor Wu believes that after the rent standards are divided into five levels, various disputes will inevitably arise between tenants and landlords in the future, and believes that it is necessary to study them carefully. Therefore, they were not approved at last week's Municipal Government meeting and were decided to be reviewed by the Councilors' Office and submitted to the Municipal Government meeting for discussion and decision tomorrow.

Councilors Exchange Opinions

In order to discuss the rent standard issue, Zhang Xuelian, convener of the Land Administration Group of the Municipal Council, Zhang Zhongyuan, Ye Xianggao, Yao Baozhen, and Zhou Lianze of the Social Affairs Group, Ma Junshuo and Zhu Yakui of the Regulations Group, and Councilors Jiang Hao and Chen Peide of the Tenants' General Federation, held a discussion meeting at 5:00 PM yesterday to exchange opinions. They unanimously believe that the rent standard is related to the burden of all Shanghai citizens, and the Municipal Government should reduce it as much as possible. They believe that if the Municipal Government feels that the rent classification method is inappropriate, it can be divided into residential and commercial buildings. As for the rent standard, it will be suggested that Mayor Wu base it on the original proposal of the Eighth General Assembly of the Municipal Council, that is, for residential buildings, convert the pre-war rent into gold yuan coupons, take 5% per yuan, and multiply it by the current cost of living index, which is equivalent to taking 5% of the pre-war rent as the base. For example, if the pre-war rent was 50 yuan, the base would be 2.5 yuan. For commercial buildings, 6% per yuan will be taken. This standard is very different from that set by the Councilors' Office, and whether the Municipal Government can accept it will depend on the results of today's discussion with Mayor Wu. In any case, the rent standards in this city can be determined at tomorrow's meeting.

### Lower Half of March: Cost of Living Index: Released Today

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Municipal Cost of Living Index Compilation and Review Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting at 10:00 AM today in the Municipal Government Conference Room to review and announce the fixed base period index and the chain relative index of the cost of living for employees in the second half of this month. This period's employee cost of living index is the first item after the improved compilation, and the Municipal Government Statistics Office is stepping up its compilation.

### Workers' Salary Payment: Cash Won't Be a Problem

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the issue of workers' salary payments, according to Director Cao Peizi of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, the cash panic may be alleviated and there will be no serious situation. The Central Bank is considering the Social Affairs Bureau's suggestion to relax the cash withdrawal limit for manufacturers and to issue silver dollars and fixed-amount promissory notes, and this is under consideration by the vice president. Director Cao believes that the current serious threats to manufacturers are high interest rates, narrow sales channels, and business shrinking, and the cost of living index for employees is no longer a major stimulus for manufacturers.

### Heads of Various Bureaus and Offices of the Municipal Government: Handling Fake Handover: The Mayor Will Travel to Hangzhou for a Spring Outing at the Beginning of the Month

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, various bureaus and offices of the Municipal Government handled fake handovers, and prepared lists of completed official matters in each department, as well as those that had not been completed, and handed them over to the Municipal Government Secretariat for compilation. It is reported that Mayor Wu is scheduled to take leave from April 1st and leave Shanghai for a spring outing in Hangzhou at the beginning of the month, with a vacation of ten days to half a month. After the vacation, he will still return to Shanghai, but he will firmly resign from the position of mayor. He hopes that by the time he returns to Shanghai, the central government has already decided on a new candidate, so that formal handover procedures can be carried out. Furthermore, he will no longer approve the resignations of the heads of various bureaus before his own resignation is approved.

### The Headless Dismembered Corpse Will Be Exhumed Again Today: The Investigation Results Show Two People Are Similar: Suspects Are Under Close Surveillance

[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of the headless dismembered corpse on Jinyi Road has achieved considerable success after days of investigation by the police and relevant agencies, and the truth will soon be revealed. The investigation of the case is based on a study of recent missing persons, constantly narrowing the scope. As a result of the summary, there are five people who are more likely, and finally only two people remain, who are quite similar to the dismembered corpse investigated in this case. One of them was discovered by the Changshu Police Sub-bureau, and the other was discovered by other agencies. Detailed investigations have been carried out on the characteristics of the missing persons, such as height, weight, skin and hair color, scars on the body, and skin diseases. The police bureau is scheduled to exhume the coffin today together with the forensic doctor to determine who the victim belongs to. If there are characteristics in the thirty-two pieces of the corpse that match the characteristics, the case will take a sharp turn and can be solved immediately. However, considering the meticulousness of the murderer in destroying the corpse and eliminating traces, the characteristics on the deceased's body may have been destroyed, and it may not be possible to find the characteristics in these thirty-two remains. However, if the missing parts match the characteristics on the deceased's body, it will also be a strong counter-evidence. As for the identity of the deceased, according to the investigation results, the deceased may have had a criminal record. The murderer cut off his fingers for the purpose of destroying his fingerprints so that the identity of the deceased could not be determined. After the case-handling personnel investigated from various aspects, it has been determined that this is undoubtedly a vendetta case. Before the murderer is apprehended, this newspaper will continue to keep it secret for the sake of prudence. But it can be asserted that the suspects involved in the case are under close surveillance by the investigation network arranged by the police detectives, and the time of apprehension is not far away.

### Shui Yao Chen Disappears in Hangzhou: The Police Bureau Is Investigating His Whereabouts

[Our Newspaper's Hangzhou 30th Report] On the eve of the discovery of the headless dismembered corpse in Shanghai, a man named Shui Yao Chen disappeared in Hangzhou. He was from Yin County, 44 years old, and lived at 22 Yiru Lane, Tiantong Road, Shanghai. Shui came to Hangzhou on the 17th to mourn his teacher, Sun Yici, the former director of the Zhejiang Provincial News Office, who was 57 years old, and disappeared on the 17th. On the 21st, a headless dismembered corpse was discovered on Jinyi Road. Shui's family came to Hangzhou to look for him but could not find him, and placed a missing person advertisement in the newspaper on the 28th. The Changshu Road Police Sub-bureau in Shanghai read the newspaper and went to inquire, suspecting that he was the victim of the dismemberment case. Deputy Director Wang Sizu and detective Zhu Yunrong specially came to Hangzhou yesterday. After investigating with relevant parties today, it is believed that Shui's wife may be the one. The reasons are said to be the following: (1) He is burly, and his long gown can fit the corpse. (2) Shui's shirt collar is 16 inches, and the corpse is the same. (3) Shui's feet have characteristics, scars on the toes, gray spots on the nails, and moisture on the feet. The corpse's fingerprints and toes were cut off. (4) The dates of Shui's disappearance and the discovery of the dismemberment case coincide. It is found that Shui was originally a wealthy businessman. During the occupation period, he opened the Dada Money Shop at the entrance of Xiangfen Lane, Nanjing Road, Shanghai, and engaged in export trade, cotton cloth, etc. He has been unemployed for four years since the victory. He has a mother, a wife, and nine children. The eldest daughter is already 21 years old. He used to have a Suzhou concubine, but she has died. He has a very good relationship with his wife, and his wife must pack his luggage when he travels. When he left home on the 17th, his wife did not know where he was going, nor did she pack his luggage for him. His mother had seen him wandering around, thinking deeply and nodding. After arriving in Hangzhou, he stayed at the Huaxing Hotel on Zhongzheng Street, wearing a coffee-colored gown and black leather shoes, looking quite worried, and asked for a quiet room. After opening room 27, he asked the tea room who was in room 28 opposite, and was told it was the manager. He used his gown to pledge the room fee. On the 18th, he received 60,000 yuan remitted from Shanghai and went to Sun's house to mourn and送禮 6,000. He left without eating lunch. At 8:00 AM on the 19th, he told the tea room that he was going to Shaoxing. During the two days in the hotel, no guests visited him, and he only made one phone call. According to his sister Shui Xiu, he had no luggage, only a gold watch and a gold chain, and the gold buttons on his shirt weighed about seven钱. He has been missing ever since, with no news. After Deputy Director Wang investigated, he immediately telegraphed Shanghai to bring Shui's clothes and bedding to the bureau for investigation, and two police dogs were transported to Hangzhou. The latter has been transported today and will continue the investigation. According to the investigation, Shui had a quarrel with his wife before coming to Hangzhou.

### Affected by the Taiping Steamer Disaster: Employees of China Union Company Appeal

[Our Newspaper's Report] It has been two months since the Taiping Steamer of the China Union Company sank, and the aftermath has not been completely resolved. Recently, all employees of the company believed that the various measures taken by the families of the victims directly affected their livelihoods. Yesterday, they specially invited reporters to the Bank Club. Chen Yifeng, the head of the accounting department of the company and a representative of the employees, reported that since the Taiping Steamer disaster, the compensation requests made by the families of the victims to the China Union Company were divided into two parts: 162 people in Taiwan, each requesting 800石 of white rice, and 416 people in Shanghai, each requesting 35 million yuan. If the index changes when it is issued, it will be increased proportionally. This huge amount is currently equivalent to about 5,000 large gold bars, which is definitely not within the company's ability to bear. However, as of recently, the China Union Company has also made every effort to pay out most of it, including 288 ticketed passengers, each with 10石 of white rice, and 96 non-ticketed passengers, each with 7.5石 of white rice. In addition, each person was given 10,000 yuan two months ago, a total of 400 people. He said that the funds were borrowed separately by all employees from outside, so although the company is not bankrupt at present, the employees are heavily in debt. However, the families of the victims still cannot understand this. In addition to the company's Anlian Steamer being attached by them in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, the branch office address was also occupied. Recently, the families in Shanghai have even requested the attachment of the company's only general Hualian Steamer and plan to organize a committee to take over all businesses of China Union. They believe that if this is the case, the livelihoods of all employees will be cut off, the debts will be impossible to repay, and the company will be unable to fulfill its compensation obligations. Therefore, they requested that both parties should wait for legal solutions from now on and put forward eight appeals: (1) Please ask the company to stop all supplies to the representatives of the families of the victims in Taiwan and Shanghai from now on. (2) Require the company to find a way to pay off the debts owed by employees. (3) Request the families of the victims not to occupy the company's office anymore. (4) The representatives of the families of the victims should publish detailed accounts of all expenses received. (5) In the future, the company's payments should be supervised and reviewed by employee representatives. (6) In the future, when the company and the families of the victims have meetings to discuss, employee representatives should be allowed to attend, and any matters that hinder the welfare of employees may be vetoed immediately. (7) The company should legally protect the livelihoods of employees, otherwise all will file a complaint with the shareholders' meeting. (8) Request the company to thoroughly investigate and punish the dereliction of duty of the主管 personnel in Taiwan.

Furthermore, the families of the employees of the China Union Company sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to petition for assistance. The Social Affairs Bureau stated that this matter is not a labor dispute, but a legal issue, which is not under the jurisdiction of the Social Affairs Bureau, and only promised to assist in mediation within a possible range.

It was not until 3:00 PM, when the bank closed, that the details were learned by the bank clerk's盘讯. Bai then returned to the store dejectedly and did not report the incident to the manager until about 6:00 PM. Yu Long Bank received a notice from Xin Tai Bank and hurriedly investigated and went to the Huangpu Police Station to report.

### Case of Framing a Priest: District Court Held First Trial Yesterday; Five Chinese and Foreign Defendants All Shirked Responsibility; Court Ordered Additional Witnesses to be Summoned for Retrial

[Our Newspaper's Report] The five defendants, Chinese and foreign, accused of framing Father George and extorting tens of thousands of US dollars - Egger, Krieg, Ilich, Jamie, and Wang Xianzhang - underwent a first trial yesterday afternoon presided over by Judge Chen Shijing of the District Court. Among them, the German Krieg, who spoke fluent and highly accurate Chinese, answered the court directly, employing various tones to express his intentions, no different from a Chinese person. He claimed to have been operating a coal business in China for many years. On December 2nd of last year, after being arrested by the police, his hands were cuffed and he was taken to Father George's house to search for stolen goods. It was alleged that Father George was illegally exchanging foreign currency. Opium paper packets and US dollars were found during the search. He was then taken back to the police station and released, forbidden from disclosing the matter to the outside world. He denied any other extortion or fraud. The other three foreign defendants, Egger, Ilich, and Jamie, through the statements of interpreters, completely denied any knowledge of the charges against them. Wang Xianzhang claimed that he had never been to Father George's house, but he knew that a Westerner named Albour (who is at large) had used apples to cook a black paste resembling opium, which was indeed the case. Subsequently, Father George, one of the victims, testified that during the extortion, Albour acted as a French translator, making contact back and forth. Krieg was also brought to his house in handcuffs on the day of the search. After repeated questioning by the court, it was ordered that additional witnesses be summoned, and a retrial was scheduled for the eighth of next month. Jamie was ordered to post a cash bail of one million gold yuan, Egger was ordered to be available upon summons, and the remaining three defendants were remanded in custody.

### Two Railways to Prepare for Price Increase Tomorrow; Increase of 300 Percent; First-Class Ticket from Shanghai to Beijing on Special Express is 115,300

[Our Newspaper's Report] The new railway fares are scheduled to take effect tomorrow (April 1st). The Ministry of Transportation has not yet issued a formal directive to Shanghai regarding the adjusted multiples. It is heard that the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau has calculated the new fares based on the adjusted fare standards set by the Legislative Yuan. The new fares will increase by approximately 300 percent. The basic passenger fare will increase from 20 yuan to 85 yuan per kilometer, and the freight fare will increase from 27 yuan to 114 yuan per kilometer. The Railway Bureau has already submitted this calculation method and adjusted multiples to the Ministry of Transportation for approval. If the Ministry approves the above new fares, the estimated passenger ticket prices for the two railways will be as follows:

Shanghai-Nanjing Line:

Ordinary train first-class ticket: Shanghai to Kunshan, 15,500 yuan; to Suzhou, 23,200 yuan; Wuxi, 33,500 yuan; Changzhou, 43,800 yuan; Danyang, 56,600 yuan; Zhenjiang, 64,400 yuan; Nanjing, 82,400 yuan. Special express first-class: Shanghai to Kunshan, 18,500 yuan; Suzhou, 27,800 yuan; Wuxi, 40,200 yuan; Changzhou, 52,500 yuan; Danyang, 68,000 yuan; Zhenjiang, 77,200 yuan; Nanjing, 98,800 yuan. Reserved seat train first-class: Shanghai to Suzhou, 32,500 yuan; Wuxi, 46,900 yuan; Changzhou, 61,300 yuan; Danyang, 79,300 yuan; Zhenjiang, 90,100 yuan; Nanjing, 115,300 yuan.

Shanghai-Hangzhou Line:

Ordinary train first-class ticket: Shanghai to Songjiang, 10,300 yuan; Jiaxing, 25,800 yuan; Hangzhou, 48,900 yuan. Special express first-class: Shanghai to Songjiang, 12,400 yuan; Jiaxing, 20,900 yuan; Hangzhou, 58,700 yuan. Reserved seat train first-class: Shanghai to Songjiang, 14,500 yuan; Jiaxing, 36,100 yuan; Hangzhou, 68,500 yuan.

The ratio of first, second, and third-class ticket prices remains 1:2:3. That is, the second-class ticket is two-thirds of the first-class price, and the third-class ticket is one-third of the first-class price.

### Civil Affairs Office Notifies: Rice Shops Must Not Refuse Payment by Check

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to news from the Civil Affairs Office: Recently, citizens have been using checks to purchase rationed flour, and some rice shops have refused to sell. The office has notified the area commissioners stationed in each district to inform the rice shops that they must not refuse to accept checks. However, given the shortage of cash in the market and to take into account the actual difficulties faced by rice shops, citizens are requested not to use large-denomination checks to make purchases and force the rice shops to make change in cash.

### First Ration of Rice for April to Begin Distribution on the 5th

Flour Will Also Be Included in the Ration

[Our Newspaper's Report] The first round of rationed rice for April in this city has been decided upon in yesterday's food meeting and will begin distribution on the 5th. The ration price will be determined and announced by the Economic Coordination Committee at a meeting to be held at 3 p.m. on April 4th. In addition to rice, flour will also be included in the ration.

### Rebuilding the Zhabei Demonstration Zone; Budget Requires Over 50 Billion; A Distant Dream Still Requires a Considerable Period to Realize

[Our Newspaper's Report] The "Zhabei" area, with the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway stations as major arteries handling over 100,000 people daily, and the Wusong River surrounding the southwest, enjoys exceptionally convenient land and water transportation. During the January 28th Incident and the August 13th Incident, the Japanese army invaded Shanghai twice, causing severe damage. The essence of the area was reduced to ashes, and many boundaries were obliterated, leading to frequent disputes among property owners. In view of this, the Shanghai Municipal Government decided to rebuild the western district of Zhabei as a demonstration area for land readjustment in the city. First, the Shanghai Urban Design Committee designed a land use plan and produced a zoning map for the western district of Zhabei. The Land Administration Bureau, based on this plan, designed a land readjustment plan and produced a land readjustment map for the western district of Zhabei. The map divides the area into seven neighborhood units, each with schools and green spaces. The entire area has an administrative center, police and fire sub-stations, and public docks and warehouses, as well as the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway stations, designated according to the original location and needs. The construction is divided into four phases. This plan and maps have been submitted to the Municipal Council for review and approved, and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. However, due to financial difficulties, it has not yet been realized.

If the Plan Can Be Realized, a New World Can Be Opened Up

According to information gathered by our reporter from the Land Administration Bureau yesterday: the total area of the western district of Zhabei is 2,526.660 mu. If the future construction plan is successful, the area of residential land will account for 1,275.974 mu, railway land 245.216 mu, public buildings and green areas 326.380 mu, roads and local roads 679.090 mu. The construction cost for the entire area was estimated at 19,222,000.00 gold yuan during the currency reform of "August 19th" last year. Now, if calculated at 3,000 times, it would require approximately 57,666,000,000.00 yuan. The construction cost of over 50 billion yuan is feared to be beyond the reach of the current central government and local economic power.

If this plan can be realized, it will indeed open up a new world. The plan shows that residential buildings, schools, hospitals, government offices, shops, post offices, police stations and fire departments, stations, warehouses, waterworks, and roads are all well-organized. If construction is successful, it will become a model area for Shanghai.

Roads are Rugged and Uneven; Traces of War Still Remain

To understand the latest situation of Zhabei, the reporter drove to Zhabei yesterday for an on-site investigation. Crossing the railway and turning into Song Park Road, the roads were uneven, the car jumped and bumped severely, mud splashed everywhere, and both sides were lined with low thatched sheds. Those who had just come from Nanjing Road and Lin Sen Road felt as if they had suddenly fallen from the 20th century to the 18th century. Some places simply did not resemble roads. Near Zhongshan Road, there were many empty spaces. The bricks of the houses destroyed by artillery fire had been dismantled by the Japanese and local poor people, leaving the land leveled. Now, it has become large vegetable gardens.

Song Park is the only place for recreation in this area. We went in and paid respects to the statues of revolutionary martyrs. Mr. Song Jiaoren's statue appeared silent, with Zhang Binglin's seal script "Fisherman" below, and Yu Youren's inscription behind: "Mr. Song's death is a pity for the world; Mr. Song's actions are known to the world. What should I record? A truthful pen? A truthful pen! A crooked pen? A crooked pen deserves divine punishment. Alas! Tears of the underworld, blood of the world, pen of an old friend, ax of a thief, engraved on the empty mountain, awaiting good historians, inscribed in the heart, attested by heaven and earth." On both sides of the statue are two stone figures moved from the opposite side of the racecourse. The figures have been renovated, with black hats, white faces, and yellow robes, looking brand new, but there are no traces of incense. The park gatekeeper told reporters that the crisscrossing ditches and high mounds outside the gate were remnants of trenches and defensive works from the past, adding to the desolate feeling.

Empty Land Near Baziqiao; Most of the Owners are Gone

Then we turned to Liuying Road and drove to Baziqiao. The bridge crosses the Henghang River and connects Shuidian Road to the northeast, a vital thoroughfare from Jiangwan to Zhabei. During the bloody anti-Japanese war, it was the site of the tragic "eight in and eight out" battle. The reporter stood on the bridge, wanting to pay tribute to the relics of the war, but they were no longer visible. Only many newly built houses were seen. According to the local elders, the houses near the bridge were burned and destroyed in the war, leaving a flat expanse of land. Therefore, there was much empty land, and the topography had changed. After the war, most of the owners did not claim their land. As long as one spent more than ten dan of rice, one could pick any empty land to build a house, and no one would interfere. This situation is bound to cause many land disputes when Zhabei is rebuilt in the future.

As a result of the Zhabei tour, it is felt that this dilapidated place does need to be rebuilt. The question is how to raise this huge amount of construction funds? How to deal with these many shack dwellers? How to reorganize land registration? The plan is good, but realizing this plan will probably take a considerable period of time.

### Yankaolun Ship Nearly Caused Disaster En Route to Guangdong; Collision With Landing Craft Causes Damage to Both Sides; Both Ships Returned to Shanghai Yesterday for Repairs

[Our Newspaper's Report] China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yankaolun ship, loaded with goods from Shanghai to Guangdong on the afternoon of the 29th at 1 p.m., encountered Landing Craft No. 109 returning from Guangdong to Shanghai at around 8 p.m. near Baiji Mountain in the waters of Fuzhou. Due to the darkness, the two ships collided and rubbed against each other. Fortunately, both sides avoided in time, averting a major disaster. However, both ships sustained minor damage. The iron plate at the bow of the Yankaolun ship was dented, and the iron plate on the port side of the landing craft, above the waterline, was also crushed by several feet. The landing craft arrived in Shanghai at around 9 a.m. yesterday and is currently docked at Pier 7. The Yankaolun ship immediately suspended its voyage to Guangdong and returned to Shanghai for repairs, arriving at port at 11 a.m. yesterday, docked at Zhangjiabang Pier. Both ships are awaiting inspection and repair.

### Raise Awareness of Curfew; Turn On and Off Street Lights Three Times

To raise public awareness of the curfew, the garrison command previously stipulated that the city's electric lights should be turned on and off three times half an hour before the curfew was lifted every night. It is now learned that due to the different equipment of Shanghai's power companies compared to Beijing, Chongqing, and other places, a city-wide power outage would be difficult. It has been approved that the city's street lights will be turned on and off three times from now on.

### Survey of Ancient Tombs in Changzhou (Part 1)

— Jiang Dayi

At around 10 p.m. on March 19th, Mr. Yuan Wenzhong, a reporter from Shen Bao, visited me at the College of Liberal Arts of Tongji University. I was already asleep at that time. I put on my clothes and opened the door, inviting the guest into the room. The guest told me that he had visited a newly discovered ancient tomb in the southern suburbs of Changzhou and brought back a tomb brick from this tomb. He wanted me to assess the age of this ancient tomb based on this brick. I had already seen the news about the discovery of the ancient tomb in Changzhou in the newspaper two days ago. Director Yang Kuan of the Municipal Museum and Professor Mou Runsun of Tongji University both intended to invite me to investigate it together. Because the students had missed too many classes last semester, I was reluctant to further delay their class time, so I hesitated for a while and did not go immediately. Now that the reporter has delivered the materials to my door, I am of course very willing to examine them carefully.

Examination of Tomb Brick

This brick is rectangular: 38.9 cm long, 18.7 cm wide, and 6 cm thick; one side has patterns, and the other side and four sides have no patterns; one corner is slightly damaged.

The side with patterns has a design of banana leaf patterns paired with four large coins. The banana leaf pattern lacks the "main vein" in the leaf and has a hint of superimposed human figure patterns. The circles of the large coins are not very accurate, with the longest diameter being 6 cm and the shortest diameter being 5.7 cm. There are four characters on the large coins, which are very blurry. This is because the tomb brick absorbed too much water in the soil, the brick is soft, and it was washed immediately after being unearthed, causing this phenomenon. The little trace seen in the blur is that the pattern on the brick surface was made by repeatedly applying a model that is only a quarter of the size of the brick surface for four days in a row, so the four large coins on this brick are identical. After I and Mr. Zhang Ziqi of the Municipal Museum gathered together and compared the four large coins, the clearest of the four characters is a "five" on the side. On the opposite side of the "five" is vaguely a "hundred". Vaguely, there is a "big" character above, and below is vaguely a "spring" character; the calligraphy of the four characters is between seal script and official script, with the "big" character being particularly blurred.

Great Spring Five Hundred

If our view is correct, then what is written on the brick should be the coin pattern of "Great Spring Five Hundred." According to research, "Great Spring Five Hundred" was the currency created by Emperor Wu of Wu in the fifth year of Jiahe. Since the tomb brick has the coin pattern of "Great Spring Five Hundred," then the earliest year it was built cannot exceed the fifth year of Jiahe of Sun Wu.

Let us ask when this ancient tomb may have been built at the latest? According to research, although the large coin Five Hundred was cast in the fifth year of Jiahe of Sun Wu, its use as an ornament on tomb bricks could be extended to the Western Jin Dynasty. The Jianxing Three Years brick recorded in the Qianduting Ancient Brick Illustrated Interpretation, volume ten, page seventeen, is an example of a Western Jin Dynasty tomb brick with "Great Spring Five Hundred" as an ornament. Furthermore, regarding banana leaf patterns, their use as decoration on tomb brick surfaces can also be extended to the Western Jin Dynasty. The Yongxing brick recorded in the Qianduting Ancient Brick Illustrated Interpretation, volume nine, page nine, is an example of a Western Jin Dynasty tomb brick with banana leaf patterns and coin patterns as brick surface decoration. By the Eastern Jin Dynasty, not only were tomb bricks with "Great Spring Five Hundred" as decoration and tombstone brick surfaces with banana leaf patterns as decoration rare; but also the form of tomb bricks gradually became smaller, different from this tomb brick's still retaining a bit of the large Han brick typical. Therefore, in my personal opinion, the latest era in which this ancient tomb was built may not be later than the Western Jin Dynasty.

After I told the guest my opinion, I also asked the guest to donate the brick to the Shanghai Municipal Museum. On the 22nd, Mr. Wang Tianmu of the Preparatory Office of the Central Museum came to the museum, and everyone carefully examined the brick again; and we used a wooden basin to hold water and soaked the brick in the water to make the patterns on the brick surface appear more clearly. As a result of this careful examination, everyone felt that saying that the coin pattern above was "Great Spring Five Hundred" was still very accurate. However, I always felt that I should find a tomb brick with a clearer coin pattern to look at to feel at ease, so on the 23rd, when I had no classes at school, I went to Changzhou again with Director Yang of the museum.

### Strange Young Man with a Big Background: Wu Zhihui's Great-Nephew

[Our Newspaper's Wujin Report, 29th] The former city defense department arrested Yu Chongguang, a young traveler at the Central Hotel, who had been staying at the inn for half a month, was usually extravagant, had unclear whereabouts, and carried weapons, at the Yingbin Hotel casino. After several interrogations, it was learned that he was the great-nephew of Party-State elder Wu Zhihui, only seventeen years old, originally studying at Provincial Chang Middle School, but was romantic by nature and did not restrain himself. In early February, he went to Taiwan with his mother to avoid the chaos. Within a few days, he stole three gold bars, totaling 26 taels, from his mother, took a boat back to Shanghai, and squandered twenty taels at Shanghai song and dance halls. He then came to Changzhou and stayed at the inn. As for the pistol, it was borrowed from his relative and classmate Wu Xinggen. The original owner of the gun was the police chief Zhang Huanrong, who lent it to the former social section chief Gao Chuan. After Gao left office, he hastily went to Guangdong and did not return it, so it was left with the intelligence officer Wu Xinggen. Yu was very familiar with Wu, so he secretly took it out and wore it on his body, intending to show off. Once the facts were clear, the city defense department notified Yu's relative, Senator Wu Pingzhai, to post bail for him. The whole case was quite dramatic and interesting. Rich young men are accustomed to being frivolous, and public opinion is all saddened.

### Reader Consultation: Legal Interpretation; Inheritance and Debt Issues Between Direct Blood Relatives

Answered by Lawyer Tang Mingshi

Li Fufu asks: Editor, (1) My friend Mr. Wang's family is ordinary. He has two brothers, each establishing their own family and career. After their father's death, the meager inheritance will be divided equally between the two, inherited by the two brothers. The elder brother temporarily gave his share of the inheritance, two mu of land, to his mother to cultivate, to subsidize her living expenses, while the younger brother did not provide any support. Now, his mother does not work and likes to gamble. Although she has been repeatedly dissuaded, she has accumulated a lot of debt. If his mother disregards the livelihood of the two brothers, does she have the right to sell the property? (2) His mother is addicted to gambling, resulting in a lot of debt. Can the two brothers publish a statement in the newspaper to sever their mother-son relationship in order to prevent bankruptcy?

[Answer] (1) The inheritance should originally be jointly inherited by the spouse and lineal descendants. Therefore, dividing it into two shares and only receiving it by the two sons is not in accordance with the law. However, his mother's disposal of the land is also not something that she can decide alone. (2) There is no reason to sever the mother-son relationship, but if his mother has more debts than credits (or assets) after her death, then her sons (i.e., the heirs) can invoke the limited inheritance clause and use all assets to repay the debts. In fact, it is equivalent to declaring the bankruptcy of the deceased. Lenders should pay attention to the solvency of the debtors, otherwise they take risks and suffer losses themselves.

### Bank Branches to Open Silver Dollar Deposits; Decision Awaits Finance Minister Liu's Return to Shanghai; Silver and Money Trades Believe Technical Considerations Still Needed

[China Economic News Agency] Regarding the financial sector's proposal to the Ministry of Finance to establish "Gold Deposits," "Silver Dollar Deposits," and "Commodity Price Index Deposits," the Ministry of Finance is considering accepting them. Yesterday, according to reporters, the "Silver Dollar Deposit" item has been ordered by the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance to draft a "Measures for Converting Gold Yuan into Silver Dollar Deposits," which is currently under review by the Secretariat of the Ministry of Finance. The content of the measures stipulates that people can convert gold yuan into deposits at banks at the current market price, and banks will pay silver dollars at the current market price when they are withdrawn in the future. Loans will all be converted from gold yuan to silver dollars, but calculated in gold yuan. These measures will be finalized after Finance Minister Liu Gongyun returns to Shanghai from Beijing, and it is expected to be implemented in the shortest possible time.

[China Economic News Agency] Minister of Finance and Governor of the Central Bank Liu Gongyun has completed his official duties in Beijing and is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Beijing today.

[Our Newspaper] The news that the financial authorities intend to mobilize various banks and branches to establish silver dollar deposits is rampant. Yesterday, reporters consulted various related parties on the possibility of establishing them, but the response was not very good. Here, we will analyze the two types of deposit methods. (1) Deposits and withdrawals are all in gold yuan, that is, the gold yuan deposited is converted into silver dollars at the current rate and recorded in the account. When withdrawing, it is converted back into gold yuan at the current rate. The silver and money trades believe that this method only adds unnecessary trouble to the business. The silver dollar fluctuates constantly, and the silver and money trades feel overwhelmed. Unless the Central Bank can accept the re-deposit of silver dollars, the silver and money trades will find it difficult to accept these deposits. From the customer's point of view, this type of deposit is not unlike the past gold deposits. To avoid repeating the same mistakes, even if it is opened, the deposits may not be large. (2) Deposits and withdrawals are all in silver dollars. Although the silver and money trades do not have the trouble of conversion, after receiving silver dollar deposits, the silver and money trades cannot lend in silver dollars because no one would be willing to accept silver dollar loans. Since the funds attracted cannot be released, the silver and money trades will be unwilling to accept this new business. Therefore, according to observation, if the financial authorities do not have sufficient encouragement for silver dollar deposits, it may be difficult to obtain enthusiastic support.

### Gold Market Opens at Limit Up, Declines Step by Step in the Afternoon

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the trend of the gold market was uncertain, with rapid advances and retreats. In the morning, because the Central Bank still did not sell, favorable news spread everywhere, and people continued to be optimistic. Opening trading could not be done. The price was called up to the limit of 828,000, with demand exceeding supply. There was still no formal transaction until noon. In the afternoon, due to the high underground interest rate of about one yuan, and under the tight money situation, people's minds were weak, and retail investors came out one after another, opening at 833,000. In the middle of the day, under the influence of selling pressure from bank-affiliated gold dealers, the market fell all the way, retreating to 800,000 at closing. The clearing price among colleagues was not listed in the morning, and it was listed at 806,000 in the afternoon, an increase of 47,000 compared to before the holiday. The combined interest for two days was only about 65 yuan, which was actually a rise in name but a fall in reality.

Off-Exchange

[Our Newspaper] Off-exchange trading was strong. The morning opened at 855,000. Guangdong and Shanxi dealers searched vigorously, and securities dealers also made arbitrage purchases, pushing the price all the way to 878,000 and 883,000. Near noon, bank-affiliated dealers frequently sold, dropping directly to 838,000 and 843,000 at closing. Afternoon trading was light and declining, from 825,000 and 830,000, all the way down to 800,008 and 811,000, a decrease of 42,000 compared to before the holiday. The overnight interest rate was increased by 65,000 per tael, making the high to 873,000 and 877,000.

US Dollars

[Our Newspaper] There were not many US dollar transactions, and foreign firm dealers and bank dealers were still actively trading. The morning opened at 17,000 and 17,500, rising to 18,000 and 18,500. The noon closing fell to 16,700 and 17,200. The afternoon opening was 16,500 and 17,000, and the closing fell to 16,100 and 16,400, a decrease of 900 compared to before the holiday. The overnight interest rate was increased by 1,300, making the high to 17,400 and 17,700.

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, gold jewelry sales in jewelry stores were strong, and prices were firm. The morning listed the price up to 830,000 and 900,000. In the afternoon, it rose again to 840,000 and 920,000.

Silver Dollars

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the silver dollar market was firm. Due to silver dollar arbitrage transactions, several trading firms in the city had generally opened in the morning. Yesterday, about 1.8 million silver dollars were arbitraged, and buying and selling were busy. The telephone arbitrage transaction, same-day check, high for big heads reached 14,000 and 15,000, which was invisibly 17% higher than cash transactions. Street trading was active because it was the end of the month today and various industries were distributing salaries. Holders strongly supported the price, calling the big head 10,500 and 10,800 in the morning, all the way up to 12,000 and 13,000. The afternoon once fell to 11,500 and 12,500, and in the evening, it lingered between 12,000 and 13,000. Small heads were called 10,000 and 11,000, and Eagle and Dragon dollars were called 8,000 and 9,000, an increase of about 15% compared to before the holiday.

### Short Squeeze Unleashed in the Market, Chinese Stocks Forced to Decline

The Chinese stock market was initially firm yesterday, but later, major players felt that the money market was tightening. Textile and construction companies sold off large quantities of yarn, and the Central Bank secretly sold gold. Cotton yarn dealers, securities dealers, and gold dealers all sold off, unleashing a short squeeze in the market. Selling pressure was strong, and the market was forced to decline. Yong Yarn opened at 9 yuan and 95 cents in the morning. After the opening, hearing that gold had reached the limit up, people were quite optimistic. Buyers came out and pushed the price all the way up to 10 yuan and 9 cents. Later, various dealers sold vigorously, seeing a low of 10 yuan and 55 cents. Spot buyers came in to cover their positions, and the price rose again to 10 yuan and 78 cents. Near noon, due to the tightening of the money market and strong short selling pressure, the price closed low at 10 yuan and 5 cents.

Small and medium-sized stocks all opened high in the morning. Near closing, due to Yong Yarn's short squeeze, all stocks were dragged down. Meiya opened and saw 3 yuan and 34 cents again, reaching the limit up twice. Xinguang opened and turned to close flat. Jingfu followed the same trend. Xinhuo, Qinxing, and Jinglun all returned after rising. Only Neiyi reached the limit up. Zhenhua reached the limit down, and the rest rose slightly.

In the afternoon, the money market suddenly tightened, and the underground interest rate was high at 1 yuan and 20 cents. Off-exchange gold reported a decline, and the bulls were overwhelmed. The market weakened again. Yong Yarn initially opened at 10 yuan and 25 cents, falling all the way to 9 yuan and 75 cents. Later, it gradually declined, with the lowest at 9 yuan and 15 cents. Near closing, it rebounded slightly, closing at 9 yuan and 25 cents. The rest were all lower than the morning closing. The volume traded was 5.00902 billion shares.

The foreign stock market saw a tightening of the money market yesterday, and people became tired. Floating retail investors started selling, and the market immediately retreated. Yisha made 24,000 yuan and 25,000 yuan, a drop of 1,000 yuan. British Union made 27,000 yuan and 30,000 yuan, a sharp drop of 4,000 yuan. Yip Beer made 4,850 yuan and 5,150 yuan, a small drop of 300 yuan. Jardine Matheson made 85,000 yuan and 86,000 yuan, a drop of 5,000 yuan.

Gold public bonds opened at 515,000 yuan in the morning, rising all the way to 550,000. Later, due to the tightening of the money market and a slight return of gold after rising, the market followed softly. The noon closing was still 510,000. There were no transactions in the afternoon.

### Money Loosens, Production Prices Rise, Rice Rises Across the Board, Flour Initially Firm then Weak, Edible Oil Slightly Shows

Rice prices rose again yesterday due to loose money and rising prices in the production area. In the middle of the day, the price of gold was reported to be rising, so the increase was quite strong. The price of white japonica rice and thin paddy rice in the North City market generally rose by 3,000 yuan. Special japonica rice was 89,000 yuan, already approaching the 90,000 mark. In the South Rice market, door sales of white japonica rice heavily knocked on the 90,000 yuan mark. The arrival of goods in the two cities was 5,271 stones.

Edible Oil

The rising trend has slowed down slightly because prices have risen excessively in recent days. Owners are seeking to sell at high prices, and factories have also started production, increasing supply. The price is weak to rise. Soybean oil reached a maximum of 540,000, and the closing price was 520,000, a slight increase of 10,000 yuan. Raw rapeseed oil rose slightly by 20,000, while raw oil fell by 20,000. Jiangbei Jishui raw oil was 580,000, and the price of soybean cake was stable.

Flour

Initially firm then weak. The market opened with a surge in various off-exchange commodities, and the money market was relatively stable. Owners reported very strongly. Houchuan initially made a high of 33,000 yuan. Later, the money market tightened, the stock market retreated sharply, and Yong Yarn fell into the tenth level. People's minds were weak, and the market moved step by step downstream, with the last transaction at 32,250 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

The market saw a decline in the later stages due to tight funds. Soybeans fell by 35,000 yuan. Car beans made 15,000 yuan. Peanut hoarders came out, and the market supply exceeded demand. Prices were slightly weak. Corn and sorghum closed earlier, and the market saw a slight rise.

### North-South Remittance Business Temporarily Suspended from Yesterday

According to Xinhua Bank, banks designated to handle North-South remittances have temporarily suspended remittances to the North from yesterday. Since the opening of North-South remittances, there have been many remittances from the South to the North, but few remittances from the North to the South. The designated remittance banks themselves cannot balance their positions and have to temporarily suspend remittances. After more remittances come from the North, the North-South can be handled as usual.

### Central Bank to Issue Six Types of Large Bills

[Commodity Research Institute] The Central Bank will announce the issuance of the following types of banknotes from the 4th of next month, namely 5,000, 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, 500,000, and 1 million yuan banknotes. This measure should alleviate the banknote shortage in various places. Also, our reporter recently asked a certain authority of the Central Bank here when the banknote shortage can be eliminated. According to him, it will definitely be eliminated on the 5th of next month.

### Money Market Changes from Loose to Tight

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the money market changed from loose to tight. The morning opening day interest rate was still between 60 and 70 yuan. Soon, as the end of the month approached, various sectors were short of funds. The day interest rate gradually increased. It was also heard that the National Bank was selling gold in large quantities, and it was rumored that a certain bank was unstable due to a large short position. In the afternoon, the money market suddenly tightened, and the day interest rate once broke through the 100 yuan mark. Finally, it was around 80 or 90 yuan, but there were still many borrowers searching everywhere to make up for the shortage. The trend was quite tight.

Also, the tight cash situation yesterday did not improve because Fang Zhi was after the holiday. The discount rate was mostly as high as 10% or more. Bills were prevalent. The bill exchange center was extended until about 8 p.m. before the exchange was completed. The number of exchanged bills was more than 910,000, and the amount reached more than 410 billion yuan. Government banks had a net outflow of 700 million yesterday, foreign merchant banks had a net inflow of 2.3 billion, large exchanges had a net inflow of 4.9 billion, and small exchanges had a net outflow of 6.5 billion.

### Cash Withdrawal Limit for Banks and Branches Relaxed by National Bank Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] The Central Bank's cash withdrawal limit for banks and money shops has been relaxed to 18% of the overnight deposit balance, of which 20% is issued in National Bank promissory notes and 80% is issued in cash. However, as a result, due to signature issues, the number of promissory notes issued was less than 20%. As a result of yesterday's relaxation of the limit, promissory notes were issued about 350 million yuan, and cash was issued about 5.8 billion yuan (of which banks and money shops accounted for about 3.36 billion yuan).

### Cotton Yarn Rises and Falls Intermittently, Cloth Market Reaches New High

Cotton yarn initially rose then softened because Monday's surge was too severe and the money market was tight. People were thinking of risks at high prices. As a result, the increases were more than the decreases compared to before the holiday.

42-count Blue Phoenix initially opened at 1.35 million yuan. By the end of the day, because of direct sales, buyers were watching, and the rising trend finally failed to continue. It retreated to 6 million yuan at closing, a decrease of 220,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose slightly by 50,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon fell from 4.25 million yuan all the way to 3.97 million yuan at the end, finally rising by 70,000 yuan.

21-count Double Horse spot goods opened at 3.29 million yuan. Soon, it was heard that gold and securities had reached the limit up, and the price was pushed up to 3.32 million yuan. Near noon, the money market tightened and people's minds turned empty. Finally, it stood at the 3 million mark, a decrease of 50,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse initially made 3.15 million yuan, and just as it fell into the pass, it retreated to 2.82 million yuan at closing, also a decrease of 50,000 yuan. Other grades varied. 16-count and below all saw a slight rise.

The cloth market continued to rise sharply. In the early morning, hearing that gold had reached the limit up, people were excited. Local customers sucked up successively, and scattered households pulled up successively. Under the atmosphere of buying, all cloths reached new highs.

Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 122,000 yuan. Just as it reached 139,000 yuan, many short-term holders made profits and sold. The price fell back to 132,500 yuan at closing, a sharp increase of 21,000 yuan compared to before the holiday. Five Happiness fine cloth also surged by 21,000 yuan. In addition, low-end fine cloths all opened outside the 100,000 mark.

Four Gentlemen's Yuan Serge initially made 108,000 yuan, once knocking on the 120,000 mark. Before closing, it relaxed back to 106,500 yuan, finally reaching 116,500 yuan, a decrease of 9,300 yuan. After closing, it once made a small amount of 103,500 yuan. 190 high-end Shilin Factory opened at 270,000 yuan. The remaining cloths rose across the board. The market is opening the post-market for the Tiger brand. If it proceeds smoothly, it may be implemented at the beginning of next month.

### Market Ramblings

— Onlooker's Stand

Don't Underestimate the Buying and Selling of Silver Dollars; Someone Is Squeezing Blood from Employees

The way employees arrange their salaries is to buy silver dollars. They are just preserving the value of the currency and maintaining their livelihood, not seeking profit.

Salaries are paid in the middle and at the end of the month, which has become a common practice. Therefore, there is usually a rising trend for silver dollars in the morning during the week starting on the 1st and 16th of each month.

Someone is squeezing blood from the employees!

They buy silver dollars successively in the week before the middle of the month and the week before the end of the month, taking advantage of the price not having risen yet. Then, in the week after the middle of the month and the week after the end of the month, they sell silver dollars successively at high prices.

After they sell the silver dollars, they put them out for a week of interest, and then it's the week before the middle of the month and the week before the end of the month again. So, they recover the interest and then go to buy silver dollars successively, waiting until the week after the middle of the month and the week after the end of the month to sell silver dollars and put them out for interest.

Repeating this cycle, they get fat off the blood of the employees.

How cruel this is! However, the current so-called business economics is originally "man eats man," and it cannot be blamed on them alone.

There is a cash shortage everywhere, and it is becoming more and more serious.

However, in the hands of silver dollar dealers on Sichuan Road, Henan Road, and throughout the city, there are stacks of brand new cash, increasing every day, and there is no shortage.

Where does their new cash come from? Everyone is wondering.

A Hong Kong newspaper's "Shanghai Correspondence" has the following record: People in uniform dispersed pedestrians on the road and handed several sacks of new banknotes to a small money shop on Sichuan Road, receiving a large number of silver dollars. Then, more than a dozen silver dollar dealer leaders received large amounts of cash from this small money shop and distributed them to silver dollar dealers on the street, and then recovered silver dollars from the silver dollar dealers.

Where does the cash in the silver dollar dealer silver dollar market come from? Well, it comes from this way.

Believe it or not.

The Central Bank not only does not think of ways to eliminate the discount on bills, but the recent issuance of fixed-amount promissory notes and other behaviors are expanding the trend of bill discounting.

The tightness of cash in the past two days is becoming increasingly severe, so the trend of discounting is also becoming increasingly severe.

In the aforementioned Hong Kong newspaper's "Shanghai Correspondence," the following things were reported:

Friends in uniform, carrying sacks full of new cash, bought silver dollars, and also bought promissory notes and checks, in certain small money shops such as Sichuan Road. It is said that they paid cash at 90% of the face value for the bills they received. That is to say, they paid 9,000 yuan in new cash for a 10,000 yuan bill. In this way, it can be known that when silver dollar dealers receive a 10,000 yuan bill, they actually only earn 1,000 yuan in discounts, and another 1,000 yuan in discounts is collected on behalf of friends in uniform.

Those who are doing the business of discounting bills are not limited to the silver dollar market. There are also many underground money shops, and even employees of some public banks, who are also participating.

These institutions and figures who are doing the business of discounting bills are strange. They can all pay out large stacks of new banknotes with a face value of 500 or 1,000 yuan. They can handle any large bill discount.

Where does their new cash come from?

Besides the issuing agency, no one can supply new cash so sufficiently.

Of course, we cannot assume that the Central Bank refuses to issue cash to merchants and reserves it for buying silver dollars.

Of course, we cannot think that the Central Bank refuses to issue new cash to merchants in order to earn a 1,000 yuan discount in the underground money shop market.

However, we cannot confirm that this new cash in the silver dollar market and bill discount market is not directly supplied by the Central Bank.

We only know that all cash is issued by the Central Bank. Only the Central Bank can supply all new cash.

New Finance Minister Liu Gongyun is also the new Governor of the Central Bank. Mr. Liu is a financial expert and is trusted by the central government. We hope that he will take action to thoroughly investigate and quickly eliminate the cash shortage and eliminate the crime of discounting!

Large Bundles of New Cash Appear in the Evil Market; Hope Finance Minister Liu Thoroughly Investigates

### Women's Basketball Circle

— Mei Jie

On the Xinghua Team with a Good Roster

If we use the Xinghua team's personnel to deploy a lineup as follows:

Forwards: Zhang Xiuli, Wang Zhelun, Wang Huiling, Wang Shan, Qian Mengyue

Guards: Zhu Lanzhen, Huang Ruyu, Wang Shan, Zhu Jiazhen, Wu Zhaorui

Any qualified fan who sees the above lineup will certainly - everyone will think of their results. Aren't they able to steadily defeat the Li team and threaten the Green team? Even in the middle school cup, Minli can also defeat Qixiu. Xinghua has the soldiers of Minli and also has city representatives such as Wang Shan, Wu Zhaorui, Zhang Xiuli, and Wang Huiling. It should be better than Minli, and the Li team is the backbone of Qixiu. Based on this, Xinghua seems to be so uncompetitive in this league. The previous evening, Luo Yuehan only played half a game. Although it is said to be Yuehan's hard work, it also shows the decline of Xinghua.

The good or bad of everything is naturally not without factors. The reason why Xinghua has such good talents but the results are not ideal, in the author's observation, should have the following two problems.

(1) Management is not effective - Perhaps many people will not believe this. Everyone in the circle knows that the backstage manager of the Xinghua team is our old friend Qiu Hongkang, and the person fully responsible for external management is Qu Xirong, the secretary-general of the basketball committee. Qiu was previously the manager of the front-line women's team. He has rich experience and a sensitive mind, and Qu is a figure of the authorities, which is even more valuable. Then, why is it said that management is not effective? Hongkang has been busy with other things recently and does not pay much attention to it. Qu has a lot of heroic abilities, but lacks delicate ideals, so there are shortcomings of excess and deficiency. The so-called excess is that the estimate of the players' ball skills is too high. The so-called insufficiency is that they cannot be urged to do substantial training. Therefore, in terms of management, if Qiu and Qu cooperate fully in the future, a wise and courageous mixed effort will still have hope in the Mayor's Cup.

(2) Lack of training opportunities - Xinghua's performance in this session is completely trapped in the individual performances of a star-type idol system. There are good talents but no good performances. This is based on this. My criticism must be the lack of opportunities to practice together. Therefore, in the recent tactics, there are only personal skills, no team cooperation, no way to attack, and no full defense. Naturally, it can only be inferior and fail to exert its personal advantages. This is very regrettable.

Xinghua has this problem in this session, so she is frustrated. If she can improve, she should have high hopes. For example, each of the players in their team has special advantages. Let's see:

Wang Huiling - has height, speed, is lively and can shoot, a good center forward. However, she did not play in this session due to heavy schoolwork, which is also a major regret for Xinghua.

Zhang Xiuli - can rush and is energetic, extremely brave, and has excellent corner shooting skills. Unfortunately, she has been away from this for a long time, and it is inevitable that her color will be reduced.

Qian Mengyue - has a strange style of shooting, and it looks like she can move it at will, but nine times out of ten she hits. She is a strange talent the previous evening, but she suffers from short-sightedness and is slightly at a disadvantage.

Wang Zhelun - interception skills, not letting the beard and eyebrows, is more aggressive than spicy, and shooting has not yet reached perfection.

Wang Shan - has a slender figure, is light and good at jumping, can be a forward or a guard, and is good at follow-up work, a female basketball all-rounder.

Huang Ruyu - sees people extremely tightly, has a good position, and also has thresholds for blocking. She is shorter in stature and prone to fouls.

Zhu Jiazhen - has a healthy physique, superhuman height, and should be more convenient to get the ball. She seems to be able to beat others as a defender, but her movements are slightly slower.

Zhu Lanzhan - pinning people is so tight that those who are hit will be devastated. The disadvantage is that they are prone to fouls.

Wu Zhaorui - has a clear mind, and has a way to grab the ball and block people. She is also good at avoiding people dribbling.

Here - what I want to list is that several of Xinghua are very good in sportsmanship. Then, it is regrettable that they abandoned the game against the Green team for no reason in this session. I hope to be able to reform myself. I don't know if the team will participate in the Mayor's Cup? If you participate, then review my words and work hard, I think there will definitely be amazing results and good performances to please the fans.

### Renyu and Haiqing Fight for Second Place: The Basketball League's First Division Nears Conclusion

The basketball league originally had three First Division matches scheduled today, but the highly anticipated second-round game between Hua Lian and the Shanghai Police team was postponed due to unforeseen circumstances, leaving only two matches. The games will be held at the City Gymnasium starting at 5:30 PM, with ticket prices at 500 yuan for the balcony, 1000 yuan for the ground floor, and 1500 yuan for reserved seating. The schedule and game times are as follows:

Ping Ping – Pang Team (Second Division C) 5:30 PM

Renyu – Haiqing (First Division Makeup Game) 6:30 PM

The first match features Ping Ping versus Pang Team in the Second Division C group. The two teams are evenly matched, and their skills are both at a high level. Pang Team boasts veterans like Liu Ben, Dong Yangfeng, and Zhang Buqing, who have extensive experience but may lack endurance. Although Ping Ping is a newcomer, they defeated Taer in their group, demonstrating their strength. Xia Zhiong and Rao Yurong are young and energetic, and Wang Weijun's shooting skills are particularly excellent. They are evenly matched with Pang Team, so their competition should be quite exciting.

The second game is a First Division match between Renyu and Haiqing. This is a makeup game from the first round. Renyu's record in this tournament is second only to Hua Lian. Although the Shanghai Police team is close behind, they only have one game left against the Shanghai Police team besides tonight's game. If Renyu wins tonight against Haiqing, they can be assured of second place. They will undoubtedly give their all in this crucial game. Renyu is in excellent form, making their chances of winning high. Haiqing will be represented tonight by the Qierdun ship. Qierdun previously played for Haiqing against Mailing in the second-round league match, losing 20-41. This was partly due to unfamiliarity with the court lighting. Hopefully, their performance will be better tonight. The lineups for the four teams are listed below:

(Ping Ping) Wang Weijun, Xia Zhiong, Wang Yaoxiang, Chen Ronglin, Song Lianxiang, Sun Xuewen, Zhao Xieming, Li Yongji, Rao Yurong.

(Pang Team) Sun Mingxin, Liu Benqin, Dong Yangfeng, He Xiaoguang, Chen Beiting, Zhang Shaoqing, Song Qihou, Ji Youkun, Ling Peng.

(Renyu) Wu Xinyun, Yao Wenyi, Zhuang Yirong, Shen Pengju, Li Zhaohe, Wang Huaiding, Cai Jindian, Sun Guozheng, Xu Zhongyi, Yan Bin.

(Haiqing) Saipula, Bolang, Piweiqu, Su Pei, Habotuo, Yalu, Smith, Saimu, Shibanen, Tang Musi, Datuman.

The First Division schedule has entered its decisive stage. Three teams, Huili, Mailing, and Peifeier, have already finished their matches. Hua Lian has only lost once in twelve games, securing the championship. Renyu is in second place with eight wins and four losses. If they win against Haiqing tonight, they will secure second place. The Shanghai Police team has six wins and five losses, with three games remaining. If they win all three, they could tie with Renyu for second place. The third position is more uncertain. The current standings of the First Division are listed below:

Team Name  Matches  Wins  Losses  Percentage

Hua Lian   12   11   1   901

Renyu   12   8   4   666

Huili   14   8   6   571

Shanghai Police 11   6   5   545

Enkas  12   6   6   500

Mailing  14   5   9   357

Peifeier  14   4   10   285

Haiqing  11   3   8   272

### Pan Team Wins by One Goal Against Huaguang: Democratic Cup Tournament Championship Game Tomorrow

Pan Team and Huaguang played in the Democratic Cup yesterday in Nanshi. Huaguang's strength was affected by the absence of Wu Qixiang, but they still maintained an offensive throughout the game. Unfortunately, their shots were inaccurate, and they did not score. Near the end of the first half, Pan Team's Situ Yuan scored a goal, which ultimately determined the outcome. Pan Team showed great fighting spirit and was able to defeat Huaguang 1-0, which was not entirely unexpected.

Tomorrow at 4:00 PM, the championship team will face Daxia, the champion of the intermediate group. The referee will be Ma Youyu, and the linesmen will be Qu Rusong and Zang Wenbin. The starting lineups for Pan Team and Huaguang yesterday were as follows:

### Table Tennis Tips

— Written by Wang Xinjing, Revised by Chen Linsheng (2)

(4) What are the Benefits for Us?

It can strengthen the body: "A sound mind in a sound body." "Where there is life, there is hope." We have never seen a sick person accomplish something extraordinary. If you have great ambitions, but your body cannot withstand a breeze or the sun, then I worry about your future. I may see you as someone different from the average person. The health of our bodies and our future are closely linked. I don't want to say too much, but we can confidently say that "any divine calling, big or small, requires a healthy person to carry it out." If we want to spend our time "from birth to death" meaningfully, then we feel the importance of strengthening our bodies.

Rickshaw pullers have especially developed legs, blacksmiths have especially developed hands, and thinkers have unusually complex brains... The more you use something, the more it develops. Some sports cause the body to develop abnormally, but table tennis is an average full-body exercise. Not only is the full-body exercise average, but it also requires "mental agility", so it is also a hand-brain coordination exercise.

I am not saying that table tennis is the only way to strengthen the body, but I dare say that table tennis can strengthen the body. We know that Shaolin Kung Fu can strengthen the body, and Tai Chi can also strengthen the body. Bird's nest and tremella are said to nourish the body, but we believe that vegetables and light meals are more beneficial to the body. Table tennis is a gentle exercise, comparable to Tai Chi in national sports, and comparable to vegetables and light meals in diet. "Some people are a hundred years old as children, and some people are three years old as old men." Let's all try to be "hundred-year-old children".

I have already briefly discussed the environment of table tennis, regardless of time, place, or people. Here, I want to talk about what benefits it brings to us. I think it has several obvious points for us:

Cultivating Noble Character: We should take some time to rest when we are extremely busy; and we should often find things to do when we are free. This is the psychology of most people. In our free time, we can do good things or bad things. But according to common sense, the "crane" standing out from the "chickens" is, after all, in the minority. Most people are "chickens" that "go with the flow". So we only hear the "crackling" sound of sparrow battles, only hear drinking and guessing games, only hear talk of adultery, theft, and bandits, and rarely hear about studying proper issues... From these "common" things, we can see that most people do not know how to use their leisure time and do not have proper entertainment. This is such a dangerous thing!

"It's easy to learn bad habits, but difficult to change for the better." We should not learn bad habits before we learn them; and we should "practice upwards" while not learning bad habits. If you play table tennis whenever you are free, you can easily isolate yourself from most bad habits and maintain your original innocence. For the sake of the nobility of table tennis, we cultivate our excellent character. Once the habit of playing table tennis is formed, picking up a racket when the body is uncomfortable is like a drinking buddy having a big drink, and the joy is endless. Its ability to entertain body and mind is a topic for another article.

Increasing Work Efficiency: People of the same level, in the same environment, handling the same things, will definitely get different results. This is due to interest. With good interest, one's thinking will naturally be precise, and one's skills will naturally be agile. After doing something successful, interest is better, and external things that are enough to attract our attention can often generate interest. Whether interest is good or not, we can say that it is due to the heart in seven out of ten cases, and due to external feelings in three out of ten cases.

The Xinghua team lineup: From right to left (back row) Wang Wenlian, Zhang Xiuli, Qian Mengyue, Wang Zhelun, Zhu Juzhen (front row) Wang Ruyu, Wu Zhaorui, Wang Shan, Zhu Jiazhen.

### A Record of Meddling

— Zhong

I often like to meddle in other people's business, and many experienced elders think this is inappropriate. However, there is one thing that, in the eyes of someone who likes to meddle, is quite "satisfying".

Last month, I saw a high-class beggar using the latest scientific method to ask for money. First, let me tell you about this person's appearance: thin face, medium-sized body, buzz cut, no unsightly whiskers on his face, very clean, wearing a gray-white cloth gown, and wearing a pair of slightly shiny yellow leather shoes. He was sitting on a blanket, with his gown pulled up, revealing half of his left leg covered in cloth, folded under his right leg. His right leg was straight, so others could see that his right leg was healthy, but his left leg had a problem and he couldn't walk. A baby was sleeping on his chest, and a two- or three-year-old child, who was not very steady on his feet, was standing to his left. The child's hair was brushed with hair oil and styled in the Western fashion, but his limbs were pitifully weak. Many people were watching, and this noble beggar said to himself, "My leg is paralyzed, I can't do anything, and the child's mother is also sick." He meant that he was unemployed, but he originally had the ability to work, but because one of his legs became disabled, it affected his future. His wife is sick, which is also indirectly affected by unemployment. Plus, there is no one to take care of the child, so he has to beg shamelessly. Isn't this kind of suffering enough to arouse sympathy?

If it were really genuine, no one would bother to care. However, this kind of person's family was originally not bad, as you can tell from his clothes and the child's attire. It is truly miserable to fall to this point, so bystanders are willing to give him money. The cloth gown he is wearing is worth at least twenty or thirty thousand, so bystanders will definitely not give him ten or fifty yuan. You think, how can you be embarrassed to offer so little?

He held a lot of gold yuan bills in his hand and moved his butt forward. Every two or three steps he moved, he dragged the standing child forward. The child's heart was pure, so he opened his mouth and cried very miserably, even jumping up and down, as if he couldn't bear the strain. I followed them for quite a while, and when we reached a place with fewer people, I saw the noble beggar get into a rickshaw with the two children and disappear.

The second time I found this person near the Great World. His legs were straight, and a carrying pole was placed in front of him. In the bamboo baskets at each end, there was a dying child, and many people were giving him money.

The third time I saw him get out of a rickshaw with the two children, performing the same act as the first time I saw him. People who pitied his misfortune were again rewarding him.

I am extremely happy to see people willing to give alms to the poor, but for some reason, I felt disgusted by this beggar. I even hated his actions a little. I believe I was definitely not envious because I saw him holding a wad of banknotes. The reason I hated him was because I saw through his lies. He shouldn't deceive people, especially by using children. I don't think those children were his own flesh and blood, because the faces of the children I saw several times were different. He wouldn't have so many; and some of their ages seemed to differ by only a few months. Moreover, his expression towards the children showed no signs of pity. A question that could not be dispelled swirled in my mind: Where did these children come from? Were they simply discarded after they were dragged to death? Therefore, the third time I saw him, I told my doubts to a police officer. The police officer also found it strange, saying, "I met him on ×× Road just a quarter of an hour ago. How did he get here so quickly?" Then, the police officer stepped forward to question him, and he was visibly flustered. Apparently, he stumbled over his words, and the police officer angrily kicked him several times in the back, demanding that he stand up. At first, he still claimed to be paralyzed, willing to endure the pain. Later, the weight of the leather shoes finally cured his illness. He was actually able to stand up and go to the "police station" with the police officer.

I don't know what happened after that. But it is true that I have never encountered this noble beggar again. I hope that this rogue, who used ignorant children to swindle money, has indeed received the punishment he deserved.

### Suggestions to the Central Bank

— Weiming

I accidentally saw a Hong Kong cent bill. One side was printed with text, but the other side was completely blank.

Our country's finances are currently always in deficit when comparing income and expenditure. We use inflation to make up for it, and banknotes are constantly circulating in the market.

Now, I suggest that the Central Bank authorities might as well imitate the style of Hong Kong bills in the future banknotes they issue, only printing on one side and leaving the other side blank so they can put advertisements on it. Because banknotes circulate in a large area and are necessary for everyone, their effectiveness must also be very high. The companies and shops that advertise will definitely not suffer losses, and the Central Bank can also have a substantial income. I wonder what the Central Bank authorities think?

### Daydreaming Inventions

— Mao Yi

It is not very difficult for an inventor to obtain a patent certificate from the "U.S. Patent Office". All he has to do is fill out an application form in person or through a lawyer, pay a $30 processing fee, and then wait for the examination of his design and invention. Any "new" and "useful" art, machine, or manufacturing method, once patented, gives the inventor and his heirs "the patent right to manufacture, use, and sell" his invention for a period of seventeen years, valid in the United States and its territories.

However, the term "new and useful" is interpreted differently. Here, let me give a few examples of daydreaming inventions that the Patent Office actually approved. They are indeed new, but whether they are truly useful seems to be a big question.

A method to prevent train collisions: If two trains are approaching each other on the same track, using this new collision avoidance method, one train can drive onto a section of track and climb on top of the other. In this way, the two trains can still safely travel on their own paths.

A rocking chair with bellows to provide fresh air to the rocker.

A battleship with magnets installed all around to capture submarines.

A hat that automatically tips using levers, saving the energy of gentlemen who are courteous to women.

Glasses for chickens to prevent their eyes from being pecked by other chickens.

The most wonderful invention is a machine for catching tapeworms in the stomach. It is a doctor's masterpiece, shaped like a loaf, with a window opened in one end and a string attached to the other. Before use, the tapeworm in the patient's abdomen is starved for a long time. Then, the patient is told to swallow the machine. It is assumed that the hungry tapeworm in the stomach sees the bait in the bag through the window on the machine and will drill its head in, at which point the mechanism will catch the tapeworm. At this time, it is also assumed that the patient realizes something is happening in his stomach and quickly pulls the machine out like fishing, catching the tapeworm, and so on.

### Male Childbirth

— Yi

In theory, a pregnant woman who is about to give birth should enjoy better treatment and careful care. However, in some parts of the world, the opposite is true, and it is the man who is about to become a father but does not experience the pain of childbirth who is being cared for.

For example, in some parts of the Baltic Sea, in a family that is about to have a new baby, it is the husband who takes medicine and tonics, while the pregnant wife is completely ignored. After the baby is born from the mother's body, it is also the husband, not the wife, who nurses and raises the baby. This custom is called "male childcare."

In British Guiana, Indian women continue to work until a few hours before giving birth, while her husband can lie in bed and rest for several days before the new baby arrives. He eats specially nutritious food to ensure that his wife will give birth to a healthy baby. When the pregnant woman is about to give birth, she sneaks into the woods, while her husband lies in bed groaning as if he were really about to give birth. As soon as the fetus falls to the ground, the woman immediately rushes home to take care of her newborn baby, herself, and her husband—until he is fully "recovered" from childbirth.

### A Poetic Menu

— Fei Yuanfan

Cantonese people are good at writing beautiful sentences on menus. For example, paper-wrapped chicken is titled "Phoenix Enters the Silk Tent," and bamboo shoots fried with chicken slices are titled "Phoenix Enters the Bamboo Forest," both of which are subtle and pleasing. Now, I have selected some common and delicious dishes, and following their intention, I have crowned them with poetic names and listed them in a menu below:

Crimson Strings and Jade Zithers: Shredded chicken with agaric.

Wind's Charm, Purple Roses: Fragrant mushrooms stir-fried with chicken slices.

Purple Ribbon, Silver Gauze: Jellyfish skin mixed with tofu skin.

Silver Foundation, Hanging Flowers: Seaweed and silver needle fish soup.

Golden Kings Filling the Hall: Golden needle vegetables braised with tofu.
