### National Affairs Conference Held in Beijing Reaching Conclusions on Unity and Reform; Major Peace Talks Being Studied in Detail

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] In order to discuss major peace talks, promote unity, and comprehensively reform politics, Acting President Li invited important consultations. As central dignitaries and local officials had gathered in the capital one after another, the consultations officially began at 4:00 PM on the 1st at the Fu Hou Gang official residence. Those invited to participate included Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Yu Youren, Tong Guanxian, Ju Zheng, Shao Lizi, He Yingqin, Zhang Zhizhong, Xu Yongchang, Gu Zhutong, Wu Zhongxin, Bai Chongxi, and more than 20 important ministers and heads of departments. Zhang Qun also rushed to participate immediately after disembarking from his plane. During the meeting, Acting President Li explained the government's sincerity and determination for peace talks, and emphasized the necessity of internal unity and political reform. The participating dignitaries also put forward their opinions on the current overall situation and various issues, and discussed them in detail. Acting President Li also hosted a dinner for the participating dignitaries at the official residence, which ended at 9:00 PM. In recent days, Acting President Li has held individual talks with various dignitaries, and has reached some conclusions on peace talks, internal unity, and political reform. The meeting on the afternoon of the 1st made these opinions more concrete. It is said that this series of talks may continue for two or three more sessions. After Cheng Qian arrives in Beijing on the 2nd, he will also participate in the discussions.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] After participating in the consultations at Acting President Li's official residence on the 1st, President of the Legislative Yuan Tong Guanxian paid another visit to Acting President Li at around 9:30 PM, and left after talking for a quarter of an hour. In addition, Chairman of the National Resources Commission Sun Yueqi also paid a visit to Acting President Li on the evening of the 1st to report on matters.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Well-informed sources say that the Communist side is delaying the appointment of representatives because some details are still being processed. Once everything is in place, formal negotiations can begin in Beiping. It is estimated that positive steps can be taken within a month. It is also learned that the Shanghai Peace Delegation has reached the following agreement in principle: (1) Negotiations will be held in Beiping; (2) Each side, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, will send four representatives; (3) If there is a desire to increase the number of representatives, both sides should increase equally. It is not yet known whether Acting President Li will retain the current four "official representatives," but it seems certain that Shao Lizi will serve as the head of the delegation, with Zhang Zhizhong, Huang Shaohong, and Zhong Tianxin as the other three. It is heard that the Communist side is willing to consider the "three-thirds" plan, in which the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and non-partisan leaders participate in the new government with an equal number of representatives. However, it is currently unknown whether the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee led by Li Jishen will be included in the Kuomintang quota.

It is Widely Rumored that the CCP Has Appointed Four Peace Talk Representatives

[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] It is widely rumored here that the CCP has already appointed Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Ye Jianying, and Lin Biao as peace talk representatives.

[Our Dispatch] Regarding the prospects for peace talks, according to a certain person involved: From the conditions brought back by the Shanghai Peace Delegation, it can be seen that the CCP does not overemphasize the punishment of war criminals; on the contrary, they are unwilling to relax on the issue of military reorganization. In the military reorganization plan of the Political Consultative Conference three years ago, the ratio of military strength between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party was stipulated as five to one. Although it may not be completely reversed today, the CCP demands to occupy the majority of the military strength.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Those close to the Shanghai Peace Delegation say (10) that the Communist side no longer insists on punishing war criminals as a condition for resuming peace talks, and is also willing to make some concessions on the reorganization of the army. It is also learned that there is a tendency among the CCP leaders to "pardon" some of the important officials on the list of war criminals, but they insist that Song, Kong, Chen, Jiang, and the so-called "Four Big Families" must be punished. At the same time, well-informed sources here say that President Chiang's confidants are currently trying to persuade him to travel abroad in order to eliminate the barriers to peace or to resume power and personally make peace, but all have been coldly received by Chiang. Chen Yi, the former chairman of Zhejiang Province, was therefore detained in Shanghai.

[Associated Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] It is reported that the records of the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations during Marshall's mission to China in 1946 have been found and are being carefully studied to find a way to make them acceptable now. It is reported that all points on which the Kuomintang and the Communist Party reached a partial or full agreement during Marshall's mission to China are being listed. At the same time, the major issues on which they most disagreed and which ultimately led to Marshall's failure are also being listed in the same way, so as to avoid obstacles in future talks. These reports have not been officially confirmed.

### The Executive Yuan Will Undergo Partial Restructuring; Rumors of Sun Ke's Resignation Are a Thing of the Past; Personnel Changes or Replacements Will Be Made to the Heads of Various Departments and Commissions

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] According to a senior government official, a partial restructuring of the Executive Yuan is inevitable. Premier Sun Ke returned to Nanjing from Guangzhou to participate in the important consultations convened by Acting President Li to discuss the current situation. In addition to this, the issue of the partial restructuring of the Executive Yuan was also the main topic that Sun raised to Acting President Li. If a decision can be made on this matter in Beijing, it will still follow past practice, and will be announced after being approved by the Central Political Committee. However, the date of the announcement may not be within this week. It is said that the rumors of Sun Ke's resignation are a thing of the past. Acting President Li has painstakingly promoted unity within the government and has made every effort to communicate with various committee members. He has achieved considerable success in reaching a consensus on the current problems. Sun Ke's continued chairmanship of the Executive Yuan is one example of this. As for the Legislative Yuan's dissatisfaction with Sun Ke, due to Wu Tiecheng and Sun Ke's successive returns north and their several individual consultations, the situation is not as serious as rumored. Because Secretary-General Duanmu Kai is still in Guangzhou, the two men's policy directions may not be reported to the Legislative Yuan this week, but must be postponed to next week. The reason for the partial restructuring of the Executive Yuan is also related to the fact that all parties are dissatisfied with the top leaders of the Executive Yuan. In addition, there are heads of departments and commissions who have expressed their firm intention to resign, such as Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Communications Yu Dawei, and Acting Minister of Education Chen Xubing and Minister of Judicial Administration Zhao Chen, who are represented by vice-ministers, it is necessary to nominate successors or replace them. The senior official believes that when a partial restructuring is implemented, there may be more changes. Among the current heads of the Executive Yuan who are in the capital, in addition to Premier Sun Ke, there are Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Wu Tiecheng, Minister of the Interior Hong Lanyou (returning from Shanghai), Minister of Industry and Commerce Liu Weizhi, Minister of Finance Xu Kan (having gone to Shanghai from Guangzhou), Minister of Land Administration Wu Shangying, Minister of Water Conservancy Zhong Tianxin, Minister of National Defense Xu Yongchang, Minister of Education Chen Xubing, Minister of Food Guan Jiwang, Minister of Resources Sun Yueqi, etc. In Guangzhou, Secretary-General Duanmu Kai is in charge, but Duanmu Kai will also come to Beijing for a trip in the short term. The regular meeting of the Executive Yuan scheduled for the 2nd will be suspended once because the Premier and Vice Premier are not in Guangzhou. As for the rumors that the Political Affairs Conference will be moved to Beijing, the reporter inquired with relevant parties and it seems that there is no such decision yet. Whether this will be necessary in the future depends on how the situation develops.

[Associated Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Amid frequent peace discussions, general attention in Beijing remains focused on whether Executive Yuan Premier Sun Ke will resign, obey public opinion and move the Executive Yuan back to Nanjing, and whether the legislators will still insist on opposing Sun. Someone close to Sun said that Premier Sun originally planned to stay in Nanjing for a week, but he may now change his original plan. In recent days, Wu Tiecheng has been entertaining influential legislators almost every day, apparently with the aim of speaking up for Sun Ke. However, according to a survey on the 1st, many legislators still insist on putting forward a vote of no confidence in the government.

### National Army Around Tianjin and Beiping Has Been Reorganized by the Communist Army

[Our Dispatch] According to the CCP radio station in Beiping, the National Army around Tianjin and Beiping ended its original command system on February 21 and was officially under the command of the People's Liberation Army's Tianjin and Beiping Front Command. The transfer procedures were handled by Guo Zongfen on behalf of Fu Zuoyi. Officers of the National Army at the division level and above were summoned to attend this meeting. The Communist Army's reorganization plan stipulates: (1) The three-level command organizations of the Fourth and Ninth Army Corps and eight army headquarters originally under the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters will be terminated, and officers will be incorporated into the Communist Army's Tianjin and Beiping Front Command, various army corps headquarters, and various army headquarters. The 25 divisions under their command will be reorganized into independent divisions of the People's Liberation Army, and various special forces will be merged with the Communist Army's special forces. (2) National Army political workers can be employed after training. (3) Those assigned to work in the Communist Army and their families will enjoy the same treatment as the Communist Army. (4) National Army officers who are willing to study further will be organized into classes according to their work positions and levels. (5) National Army officers who wish to return to their hometowns will be paid three months' salary and train tickets according to their original salary, and will be allowed to take private property, family members, and one or two escort soldiers with them; officers residing in the Communist area can be divided into a share of land to which they are entitled after returning to their hometowns, and will be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of their Land Law Outline, but they must abide by the laws and decrees of the democratic government in the future. As for their past behavior towards farmers, no further investigation will be made. In addition, a "Certificate of Participation in the Peaceful Liberation of Beiping" will be issued uniformly to prove this.

### The Cruiser "Chongqing" Sailed from the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River to Yantai

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] China's largest warship, the cruiser "Chongqing," sailed from its defensive position in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River to Yantai, a port controlled by the Chinese Communists in Shandong, a few days ago. This has now been confirmed by reliable Chinese sources here. The departure from the defense line was apparently due to someone forging orders. According to the Navy Headquarters here, they were unaware of the ship's escape. Gui Yongqing is now investigating in Shanghai, and no details can be released.

### Zhang Qun Arrives in the Capital from Chongqing; Says There is No Truth to the Transfer of Hu Zongnan's Troops to Sichuan; Local Economic Reform Plan is Being Discussed

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Zhang Qun, the Chongqing Pacification Director, along with Deputy Director and Chief of Staff Xiao Yisu and his party, arrived in Beijing on a special "Chasing Clouds" plane via Weiyang in the fading light. Because many government officials had already participated in the important meeting convened by Acting President Li at 4:00 PM, only a dozen or so people, including Bai Chongxi, were at the scene to welcome them. Zhang's plane took off from Chongqing at 9:30 AM on the 1st and landed at Jiyang at around 2:00 PM, waiting to pick up Xiang Chairman Cheng Qian, who was going to Hengyang from Changsha, on the same plane to Beijing. Because Cheng was unable to arrive on time, they continued to fly to Beijing at 3:15 PM and arrived at 6:00 PM. At the airport, Zhang said that the southwestern provinces and Sichuan are now very stable. The rumor that Hu Zongnan's troops have been transferred to Sichuan is completely false. Liu Wenhui's transfer to Chengdu has been stated by himself and does not have the serious meaning that is rumored. As for the saying that the chairman of Sichuan is about to be changed, it is even more untrue. He has only been the Chongqing Pacification Director for ten days. The Southwest Military and Political Conference convened a few days ago was only to review the military and political situation in the Southwest and to plan how to reform the Southwest's politics and economy in the future. However, having only been in office for less than ten days, everything is still up in the air. He was summoned to come this time to consult with the Central Government, and there is no question of reporting on his work. When asked by reporters whether he had brought any new economic plans, Zhang said that they were still under discussion. The Chongqing Pacification Headquarters intends to imitate Central China and establish a political affairs committee to guide the political affairs of its jurisdiction. Zhang also said that the southwestern provinces have not considered issuing local currency. The Central Government's financial reform plan has now been announced, and he hopes that it will have good results after implementation and balance local financial revenues and expenditures. When talking about the peace issue, Zhang emphasized that the southwestern provinces obey the Central Government on both peace and war. When asked by reporters whether there was any hope for peace, Zhang said: "Peace is needed by the people and us. Everyone wants peace, so there is hope for peace." When asked again how peace could be realized, Zhang particularly pointed out: "We must make comprehensive efforts. If only partial efforts are made, or if I work hard and you don't, then peace is still difficult to achieve." Zhang stayed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dormitory. Zhang Zhizhong and Bai Chongxi visited and talked for a long time at 9:30 PM.

[Our Chongqing Dispatch on the 1st] Zhang Qun will stay in Beijing for two weeks on this trip.

### Cheng Qian Will Fly to Beijing Today

[Our Changsha Dispatch on the 1st] The special plane to welcome Cheng Qian landed in Hengyang on the afternoon of the 1st. Cheng took the Yuehan train to Hengyang at 12:00 PM and can take off on the morning of the 2nd. Tang Honglie, Yang Jirong, Liu Yuanrou, and others accompanied him.

### Tianjin Ta Kung Pao Suspended and Changed to Progressive Daily

[Our Dispatch] According to the CCP broadcast, the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao has been changed to the "Progressive Daily" by the newspaper's colleagues. After registering with the Tianjin Military Control Committee, it was first published on February 27. The radio station broadcast stated that the newspaper "was a mouthpiece for warlords, bureaucrats, and comprador control groups during the Beiyang warlord era, and after Chiang Kai-shek came to power, it became an organ of the Kuomintang political science system. Over the years, the basic position expressed by Ta Kung Pao has been anti-people and anti-democratic." Therefore, the newspaper's colleagues "recognized the reactionary association of Ta Kung Pao" and decided to suspend publication and "abandon this bad name and use a new name." Note: Ta Kung Pao is one of the oldest major newspapers in China. It was first published in Tianjin and has been published for more than 30 years. At present, in addition to the Shanghai version, the newspaper also publishes the Chongqing version and the overseas Hong Kong version domestically. It is said that the host of the Tianjin Progressive Daily is Yang Gang, a former female employee of Ta Kung Pao. The radio station also said that the Tianjin Xin Sheng Bao, Bo Min Bao, and Han Ying Bao have been granted permission by the city's Military Control Committee to temporarily publish. The Bo Min Bao has been republished since the 12th, and the Xin Sheng Bao and Han Ying Bao were recently published.

(4) The food expenses for government-funded students will be 6 silver dollars per person per month from February.

(6) Please pay the regular expenses of each school from February according to a certain number in December of last year multiplied by the local price index. (7) The number of government-funded students is decreasing day by day, but the number of poor students in each school is increasing day by day. Please allow each school to designate two-tenths of the total number of students as work-study students. (8) Please allocate the supplementary amount for February and the amount to be paid for March as soon as possible and hand them over to the presidents of each school to take back. (9) Please prepay temporary expenses once at three times the above standard to prepare for special circumstances. Chen Xubing expressed his agreement to the principle of paying all expenses according to the index, but said that some details need to be discussed. The presidents of each school will stay in Beijing for two or three more days and discuss the details with the Ministry of Education before returning to Shanghai.

### Cases Discussed in This Legislative Yuan Session: More Political Than Legal; Procedural Committee Suggests Holding Plenary Talks to Exchange Views on Reform and Peace Negotiations

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] It is possible that no legal cases will be proposed for discussion during the second meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan on the 4th. The Legislative Yuan's Procedural Committee held its second meeting on the 1st, and no final decision has been made on this matter. However, there are currently two important issues that must be resolved first. One is the handling of various cases. In the past, after reporting to the Yuan's plenary session, they were assigned to relevant committees for review, draft review reports, and then submitted to the Yuan's plenary session for a decision. The Yuan has twenty-one committees, requiring a large number of staff. To simplify matters, the Procedural Committee has drafted five measures on the 1st to implement classified and combined offices. Each committee will be established as usual, but its staff will be divided into political, economic, military, cultural, and social groups, according to their respective natures, and will work together. The other is that this Yuan session is more political than legal. The members are brewing discussions on important issues related to the current situation. General ordinary legal cases have therefore lost importance, and important issues related to the current situation cannot be handled in the general manner of cases. Therefore, the Procedural Committee decided to suggest holding a plenary talk for all members to exchange views on political reform plans and issues related to peace negotiations, and then decide on concrete measures. The Procedural Committee will submit the above two matters to the Yuan's plenary session for a decision on the 4th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Chen Kewen, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, will fly from Nanjing to Taiwan on the morning of the 2nd to deliver public funds to legislators in Taiwan and invite them to come to Nanjing for a meeting. According to Chen, he hopes to return to Nanjing on the 3rd.

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 1st] Liu Jianqun, Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, quietly returned to Guangzhou late on the 28th. It is said that this trip was to Hong Kong to send his youngest son to the hospital for treatment, and he denied having a "secret mission" in the south. According to the Legislative Yuan Office, Secretary-General Zhen Guwen of the Legislative Yuan recently sent a telegram to Deputy Secretary-General Yan Guofu here, instructing him to continue handling the resumption of the meeting in Guangzhou to meet the needs of the current situation.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Legislators continue to register. On the 1st, there were thirteen people including Chen Shaoxian, Wu Wangji, Hu Qiuyuan, and Wang Xinheng, bringing the total to 238 people. It is reported that Li Zongli, Wang Lihang, Yu Zheng, Liang Dong, Jiang Zhaoguo, He Xinghan, Mo Danyun, Jiang Wenfeng, and other legislators in Changsha recently telegraphed the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan, requesting them to come to Nanjing to attend the Yuan's meeting immediately.

[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 1st] More than 40 legislators staying in Chengdu will immediately go to Nanjing to attend the meeting. Tang Zhaomin and others will fly to Chongqing on the 2nd and then transfer to Nanjing.

[Our City News] Legislator Qin Qin recently sent a letter to President Tong Guanxian and all legislators, in which he stated his views on the issue of resuming the meeting, roughly saying: "The four suburbs are full of fortresses, and the people are suffering terribly. We, from our own duties, how can we bear to dream different dreams in the same bed? I hope that my colleagues will be aware of the difficulties of the times, make calm decisions on tactics and interests, save the critical situation late, not be petty on small matters, or be anxious about emotions, lest we suffer the criticism of the Song people who could not make a decision and the enemy had already crossed the river."

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The legislators from the 29 northern provinces and cities who have registered will hold a symposium on the morning of the 3rd to discuss the current situation and the northern situation.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The Press Office of the Legislative Yuan was established on the 1st, with Ma Shuyu as the director.

Editorial

### Freedom and Equality Are Equally Needed!

—The Main Principles of People's Peace—

Mr. Yan Huiqing's Shanghai Peace Delegation returned to Shanghai this morning. The people of Shanghai will surely express their sincere condolences and place deep expectations on them. The peace we, the people, desire is people's peace, and the main principles of which should be: freedom and equality are equally needed.

The reason why we, the people, want peace is, of course, for survival. However, survival must have meaning. The meaning of survival lies in freedom and equality, neither of which is dispensable. Recently, I often hear people say: "There is freedom but no equality in the government's jurisdiction, and there is equality but no freedom in the CCP's area." In fact, these observations are just general superficial talks. It is difficult to say exactly what boundaries the so-called "have" and the so-called "have not" have reached. However, even from this relief-like critique, it can be seen that ordinary people really feel that freedom and equality are equally needed. However, they feel that freedom and equality are like fish and bear's paws, and they want to have both. Therefore, they seem to be somewhat dissatisfied with the real life in these two regions. Because of this, they hope for a peaceful political environment so that everyone can have freedom and equality.

In today's China, in China where the war has not yet ended, to be honest, no matter where, freedom and equality may not be fully enjoyed by the people. This is not an extravagant demand on our part. Before peace is fully realized, this is inevitable. Even in the world where the two major groups are still engaged in the Cold War, it is probably still wishful thinking for all of humanity to enjoy freedom and equality.

Let's not talk about other countries for the time being, let's just take a look at our own real situation.

First, let's talk about equality: In the government's jurisdiction, the Principle of People's Livelihood has not yet been seriously implemented. In the past, it may have been intentionally or unintentionally moving in the opposite direction, so that in the past ten years, the rich have become richer, the poor have become poorer, and the middle class has been almost completely destroyed. This is of course an unequal social pathology of economic life; the criticism of the three words "no equality" cannot but be said to be pertinent. In theory, in the CCP's area, regardless of whether they are practicing communism or New Democracy, it should be as advertised, with true equality. We don't need to list the refugees who were forced to flee from the CCP area because of liquidation struggles, how they lived an unequal life at that time, suffering to the extreme, and even leaving their hometowns, crying for hunger and cold. Even in the bits and pieces of news recently transmitted from Peiping, we can seem to glimpse some not-so-equal scenes. The luxury of the Six Nations Hotel, the grand banquet of sixty tables at Dongxinglou, is as described by a certain newspaper, "When the wine is drunk and the ears are hot, they forget the endless flames of war!" After the cheers and drinking, I wonder if there are still compatriots on the streets and in the fields who cannot get millet bran? If we compare this with the result of some workers in Tianjin demanding higher wages and shorter working hours, but instead getting an 80% wage cut and two more working hours, where is the equality?

It is almost universally known that there is no freedom in the CCP area. Although some people want to support the scene in various ways, saying how free and comfortable it is there, they can't hide the facts after all. There is no need to cite hearsay. Just look at the fact that American reporters are generally prohibited from interviewing and sending telegrams, and Mr. Cheng Shewo's World Daily and World Evening News have been sealed up (not to mention Yishibao and other newspapers). Even Tianjin's Ta Kung Pao is being subjected to the title of "reactionary newspaper" and forced to change to "progressive newspaper." It should be known that terms such as freedom of speech and freedom of the press are absolutely unusable in the CCP area. As for other freedoms, such as freedom of residence, freedom of belief, freedom of communication, etc., whether there is no interference can be proved by facts. In the government's jurisdiction, although there are still people shouting to fight for freedom, at least in terms of freedom of speech, it is much freer than in the CCP area. However, before the state of war has ended and peace has not been truly realized, due to the facts, there are indeed many laws and actions that restrict people's freedom. The inability to stop the implementation of martial law, the continued arrest of military spies, and the prohibition of the publication of unregistered newspapers and periodicals, etc., we cannot but admit that the people are not completely free.

Therefore, we believe that when peace talks begin, both parties should pay more attention to the wishes of the people. Instead of focusing on arguing about how to distribute territory and political power, it is better to pay attention to how to determine policies so that the people can enjoy full freedom and true equality.

More than 4,000 people participated. Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng attended in military uniform and said in his speech: Since Taiwan's restoration, although various production and construction projects have made progress every year, they have still failed to catch up with the highest records during the Japanese rule. We still need to work together in the future. Now, I will explain the main points of the provincial government's policies: Regarding politics, based on the demands of the people of the province, they unanimously hope to implement constitutional government and reorganize the public opinion organs. However, this matter requires considerable time for preparation. First, we must train the people to exercise the four powers, so we have decided on five steps: (1) Promote local autonomy, (2) Improve administrative efficiency, (3) Strengthen organizations at all levels, (4) Establish a personnel system, and (5) Promote land reform policies. Regarding the economy, increase production to implement the food industry as the center. This year, it is planned to produce 1.2 million tons of food, and strictly implement the "37.5%" rent reduction, which will be used as the standard for evaluating county magistrates. Secondly, it is necessary to improve the transportation adjustment mechanism, and at the same time, it is decided to fully supply production loans to public utility agencies, but they must be repaid at the actual price of the goods. The foreign exchange earned from exports, except for the needs of the agency itself to enrich its equipment, the rest will be turned over to the provincial government for overall distribution and must not be spilled out. Regarding culture: The first is to popularize national education and fully provide funding, and the second is to equalize education so that outstanding young people have as many opportunities as possible to go to school. Chen said at the end: Governing does not require much talk, it should be expressed with facts. This administrative meeting especially hopes that all participants will be frank and review the advantages and disadvantages. Then Fu Sinian, Huang Chaoqin, Chen Zhiming, and Ge Zhizhong gave speeches respectively before the meeting adjourned.

A preparatory meeting was held in the afternoon. More than 220 members attended and passed the rules of procedure and agenda, and assigned personnel to the review小组. The大会 received a total of 407 proposals.

### Taiwan Newspaper Paper Allocation Stopped

Chen Cheng Explains Three Reasons

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 1st] Taiwan's newspaper industry is about to face the most difficult environment. Chairman Chen has recently issued a hand order to the Paper Industry Company to stop all paper allocation to the newspaper industry from March. According to reports, 90% of the dozens of newspapers in the province rely on paper allocation for survival. Each order has an allocated price of only 50,000 yuan. If they seek it on the black market, it will cost more than 200,000 yuan. The Newspaper Association has held a meeting and decided to seek a way to survive on its own.

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 1st] Chairman Chen stated in his opening speech at the administrative meeting today that the reasons for stopping the paper allocation to newspapers are: the Paper Industry Company has been losing more than 7 billion yuan annually due to this paper allocation, which has made it impossible to increase production. He took this measure decisively in order to take into account the cost of the Paper Industry Company, avoid the suspicion of manipulating public opinion and engaging in corruption, and the current need for a large amount of paper to print textbooks. Chairman Chen hosted a luncheon for the heads of newspapers in the provincial capital this afternoon, introducing the new Director of the News Bureau, Wu Xize, and further explaining the issue of stopping paper allocation.

### Siamese Rebellion Suppressed: Government and Rebels Reach Agreement; Coup Reportedly Masterminded by Followers of Former Prime Minister

Thirty of the rebels who occupied the royal palace on the evening of the 27th have been arrested. Unofficial estimates put the number of dead and wounded in the fighting at at least fifty. A government statement said that a total of seventy people had been arrested, but did not list the names of the rebellion leaders.

### Indonesia Refuses to Attend the Hague Round Table Conference, Will Propose New Solution Based on the Current Situation

[Associated Press, Batavia, 28th] The Republic of Indonesia refused on the 28th the Netherlands' invitation to attend the Round Table Conference on the Indonesian issue to be held in The Hague on March 12th. At the same time, the Republic criticized the Netherlands for failing to implement the Security Council's resolution on the Indonesian issue. This straightforward rejection statement from the Republic came from Bangka Island.

Dr. Roem, head of the Indonesian Republic delegation, telegraphed to Batavia: "Our government has never participated in any action that evades the implementation of the Security Council's resolution." Neutral parties in Batavia, including United Nations officials, immediately stated that the Republic's refusal has split the fate of the Hague conference.

[Reuters, New York, 28th] Indonesian representative to the Security Council Palar stated today that he expected the Indonesian government would not accept the Indonesian plan proposed by the Netherlands, nor would it agree to participate in the conference planned by the Netherlands. The Republic of Indonesia will propose its own plan based on the current situation in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. Palar also pointed out that the Netherlands' statement regarding Indonesia completely disregards the Security Council's three resolutions, and its intention is to avoid restoring the Republic of Indonesia, to avoid negotiating with the Republic of Indonesia as a party to the dispute, or to withdraw Dutch troops, which is stipulated by the Security Council's resolution.

[Reuters, The Hague, 1st] Dutch representative Noelke flew to Bangka Island next to Sumatra Island yesterday with the Dutch government's invitation, and is scheduled to return today after delivering it to Indonesian Republic President Sukarno. At the same time, a United Nations plane will also carry representatives of the Indonesian Republic from Batavia to Bangka Island today.

### European Unification Committee Issues Declaration, Clarifying General Principles of Policy, Stipulating the Establishment of a European Parliament With West Germany Holding One Seat, Maintaining Peace and Freedom, Closely United to Save Survival

[Reuters, Brussels, 28th] The European Unification Movement Committee unanimously passed today the "Declaration of the Movement's Policy Principles," which stipulates the establishment of a European Parliament, giving West Germany a position in the Parliament, and allowing refugees who fled from behind the "Iron Curtain" to have voting rights in the meeting.

The Declaration stipulates that the European Parliament should be elected by the parliaments of each country, and each representative should be able to represent all levels of life in their country, and be committed to assisting in the establishment of a democratic system for a unified Europe. The total number of representatives from countries with democratic governments should be at least three hundred, and the delegation from each country should include members of parliament and people outside parliament. The European Unification Movement Committee's declaration also recommends that the delegation from each country's parliament should reflect the strength of each party in the parliament. In addition, the European Parliament should meet two to three times a year, for a total of at least forty-five days, and its discussions should be based on matters of concern to the entire Europe. The Declaration specifically points out that today's world is controlled by the political and economic forces of continental units, and it is difficult for European countries to survive by acting independently. Europe must unite to maintain the peace and freedom of its people, improve its material prosperity, and protect its principles that are threatened today.

### Hoover Commission Advocates Unifying Military Institutions

Enhancing the Power of Civilians in the Department of Defense

[United Press, Washington, 28th] The government reform committee chaired by former President Hoover submitted a report today advocating the unification of military institutions and enhancing the power of civilians in the Department of Defense to control the military. The report stated that the President and the Secretary of Defense lack civilian control over the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest military body. There are disagreements within the Department of Defense, leading to multiple conflicting orders and wasting national treasury. The authority of the Department of Defense should be concentrated in the Secretary. The Joint Chiefs of Staff should not act unilaterally and should be controlled by a chairman. National security depends on the cooperation and balance of the Navy, Army, and Air Force. If there is infighting, it will be extremely harmful. The Joint Chiefs of Staff is composed of the chiefs of staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and the President's Chief of Staff. President Truman recently appointed Eisenhower as the temporary chairman.

### Korean Commission Again Urges Soviet Assistance in Contacting North Korean Leaders, Otherwise It Will Negotiate Directly With North Korea

[United Press, Tokyo, 28th] Chairman Singh of the United Nations Commission on Korea stated today that the group recently requested the Soviet Union's assistance in contacting North Korean leaders to seek their views on the merger of the North and South. If the Soviet Union cannot assist, the committee may choose a location in China to contact North Korean representatives to promote North-South Korean unification. Although the work is difficult, it is not impossible. I do not hope for a miracle, but I hope to find some way to reduce the current economic, cultural, and social barriers to division. South and North Korean leaders must cooperate before they can unify. There is currently no sign of cooperation, and the situation is even more difficult than a year ago. There is little commercial or other exchange between South and North Korea.

### Strength of Soviet Air Force in the Far East Revealed by Soviet Pilot Who Fled to Japan

[Report from this Newspaper] New York Broadcast, 1st: Tokyo News, Balashkov, a Soviet Air Force officer who fled to Japan from the Soviet Union last year, recently told reporters that the Soviet Union has about 40 airfields in the Far East, of which about 15 can accommodate four-engine aircraft. However, the Soviet Union has no four-engine bombers or post-war new aircraft in the Far East. He also stated that the total number of Soviet aircraft in the Far East is between 1,000 and 1,200. The Soviet Union has no aircraft carriers in the Far East. He also said that before the Soviet army withdrew from North Korea last year, the army and air force headquarters were located in Voroshilov-Ussuriysk, and North Korea, while the naval bases were located in Gaya-Gavin and Vladivostok.

### United States Refuses to Extradite Soviet Pilot, Turns Him Over to Refugee Organization

[Reuters, Tokyo, 1st] The U.S. Army Department revealed today that Soviet Army pilot Balashkov stole an aircraft and fled to Japan on November 10th last year, making an emergency landing on Raichish Island north of Hokkaido. After requesting asylum from the U.S. authorities, he has been released by the U.S. authorities and turned over to the International Refugee Organization for resettlement. Balashkov, 26 years old, fled from Vakanai on the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk in Siberia. He originally planned to fly directly to Hokkaido, but ran out of fuel and made an emergency landing on Raichish Island. At the time, he told the U.S. authorities that he was Lieutenant Masazhrov and that he was determined not to return to the Soviet Union. During the Great War in 1945, he attempted to fly to Finland to escape from the Soviet Union, but the plane crashed near a Soviet hospital and he was sent to a rear hospital. The Soviet authorities did not notice his escape plan. After he fled to Japan last year, the U.S. Far East Command immediately notified Trivianko, head of the Soviet delegation in Japan, and allowed the Soviet side to question Balashkov. Unexpectedly, the Soviet side rejected this suggestion twice, and at the same time requested that the fugitive be extradited to the Soviet delegation. The U.S. authorities pointed out that forced extradition against the will of the escapee is contrary to U.S. traditions and policies and cannot be permitted. Balashkov was finally handed over to the International Refugee Organization by the U.S. authorities for resettlement today.

### U.S. Aid to Europe Fund May Be Slightly Reduced

The committee held a closed-door meeting to make a final review of the case. The case would extend the Marshall Plan for 15 months, stipulating that $5.58 billion would be used during this period. Committee Chairman Connally told reporters that he was "generally" satisfied with ECA Administrator Hoffman's statement that any major reduction in the $940 million earmarked for Britain would be unfortunate.

### Insisting on Territorial and Reparations Demands, Yugoslavia's Attitude Turns Strong Again, the Path to an Austrian Peace Treaty Remains Bleak

[Associated Press, London, 1st] Yugoslavia warned on the 1st that unless Austria is willing to make territorial concessions, further negotiations on an Austrian peace treaty would be impossible. Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister Bibergle told representatives of the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference that "the current border is unfair and needs to be changed." Bibergle said, "If there is no agreement on this point, all negotiations will be impossible." Bibergle said that Yugoslavia had reduced its previous demands and "sacrificed a lot." This refers to the compromise proposal put forward by Yugoslavia, which requires the four powers to accept a principle that Yugoslavia should receive territorial and reparations, and that the Slavic minority in Austria should have civil rights guarantees, some of which should be granted autonomy. Bibergle put forward this proposal last week, but Britain, the United States, and France have refused to change the borders of Austria. Representatives of Western countries believed that they were making progress in resolving the disputes between Yugoslavia and Austria, and they were very surprised by Yugoslavia's strong stance today.

### United Nations Reacts Coolly to Development Plans for Underdeveloped Countries, Suggests Establishing a Committee to Investigate World Labor Conditions

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 8th] After U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Thorp recently explained President Truman's plan to develop the world's underdeveloped countries to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, some representatives expressed disappointment. Indian representative Sundaram declared that the United States' draft of the Truman plan seemed to have changed the President's "brave new plan" into the "Holy Roman Empire," but it was neither "holy," nor "Roman," nor an "empire."

At the same time, Sundaram, like others who spoke on the plan today, expressed willingness to cooperate with what he called the "challenge to the United Nations." British representative Mayhew pledged support for the U.S. plan and said that the United States could provide technical assistance to participate in the implementation of the plan, but the United States could not provide financial assistance due to its own financial difficulties. Belgian representative Langenhove called for unanimous international action to help the economic development of underdeveloped regions. The Soviet bloc is expected to criticize the plan as another action of U.S. imperialism.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 28th] Soviet representative Tsarapkin suggested today in the Economic and Social Council to establish an investigation committee to investigate the living conditions of workers in various countries around the world. According to the Soviet proposal, the committee will also investigate allegations regarding the existence of forced labor camps in the Soviet Union and people's democracies. The committee will include representatives from the Soviet Trade Unions, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, the British Trades Union Congress, and the trade unions of China, France, Italy, Germany, Japan, India, and other countries. The committee's task is to submit reports on the unemployment and working conditions of the countries it has investigated, paying particular attention to the working conditions of workers in colonial and trust territories. The Soviet Union's above proposal shows that the Soviet Union's attitude has changed greatly.

### Dismembered Male Corpse in Two Strange Suitcases on Train at North Station: Luxury-Clad Escort Arrives in Shanghai from Hangzhou Claiming Intention to Transfer to Changzhou: Railway Bureau Dispatches Police to Investigate Suspects

[Report from this Newspaper] A horrifying and bizarre suitcase corpse case occurred at the North Railway Station in this city yesterday. The corpse was dismembered into seven pieces and hidden in two suitcases. The "suitcase corpse" originated from Hangzhou and was intended for Changzhou. The terrifying individual responsible for transporting the "suitcase corpse" to Shanghai was a middle-aged man dressed in luxurious attire. After discovering this, both the road and municipal police departments immediately mobilized their entire force of plainclothes detectives to investigate. It was reported in the evening that important clues had been obtained, and it would not be difficult to solve the case immediately. Full details of the case will also be revealed in the coming days.

At approximately 2 PM yesterday afternoon, the 24th express train from Hangzhou on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line arrived at the North Station. After the train pulled into the platform, passengers disembarked. In the second carriage, a middle-aged male passenger wearing a black wool overcoat, yellow leather shoes, and carrying a briefcase beckoned baggage porter No. ×× into the carriage to retrieve two 38-inch yellow soft-tire large suitcases. After getting off the train, the passenger did not exit the station, claiming that he urgently needed to transfer to Changzhou. The baggage porter told him that there was still plenty of time before departure, so he could purchase a ticket first. However, the passenger replied, "First, send the luggage onto the train to secure a good seat, I am willing to wait on the train until departure." The baggage porter complied with the passenger's wishes, leading him to the 74th Shanghai-Changzhou local train on the Beijing-Shanghai line that had just pulled into the platform, placing the two suitcases on the luggage rack, and then departed. At this time, there were still more than two hours before departure, and the train had not been marked with a train number, so there were no other passengers on the train. At 3:40 PM, a cleaner boarded the train to clean and found no one on board, but two large yellow suitcases were left on the luggage rack. The cleaner, assuming that the luggage had been forgotten by a passenger, reported it to the on-duty road police as a matter of routine. The road police officer then accompanied the cleaner onto the train to inspect the suitcases. They saw that the two suitcases were very new, and the leather material was also of high quality, but they were not locked, which raised suspicions. However, they had no authority to open the suitcases for inspection and immediately reported to Inspector Guo of the Eighth Police Station. Guo accompanied them to the train and also thought that such suitcases must contain valuable items, why not lock them, and why should they be left unattended, and it absolutely did not seem like items forgotten by a passenger, so he ordered the cleaner to move the first suitcase down, push open the suitcase lid, and saw that the suitcase was covered with white cloth and cotton. Inspector Guo probed it with his hand, soft and elastic, with a harder circular object in the middle. He pulled away the white cloth and was shocked to find that it was actually a male head. The cleaner could not help but scream in horror beside him. Inspector Guo forbade him from making noise, instructed him to keep the secret, and continued to investigate. Below the head were the chest and two arms. The second suitcase contained the lower body and two legs. The corpse was divided into seven pieces and was completely naked. After Guo completed the inspection, without showing any expression, he still placed the two suitcases in their original positions and ordered the road police to secretly monitor them. He then returned to the police station to report. After receiving the report, Police Chief Jin immediately reported to his superiors. The Police Department immediately mobilized all plainclothes officers and dispatched them separately to investigate, and also sent other officers to secretly monitor the two suitcases on the 74th train. Detectives were also deployed to Hangzhou and Changzhou. At approximately 7 PM, the Police Department received a report from the on-duty criminal police officers, stating that they had found important clues and were currently working hard to pursue them.

According to the railway police department's speculation, the male corpse in the suitcase was approximately 30 years old. This case may be a love triangle murder or a kidnapping case. The murderer was definitely not alone because the cut marks on the dismembered corpse were smooth and even, obviously cut with an extremely sharp knife or axe, and there was very little blood on the corpse pieces, possibly washed with water. Based on various signs, it can be concluded that this was a premeditated murder with a strict plan. The murderer must also be an exceptionally meticulous and sinister person.

### Government and Education Personnel's February Salary at 75 Times Not Yet Fully Paid

The February salary for government and education personnel, which was decided to be adjusted to 75 times the original amount at the political affairs meeting held in Guangzhou on February 9th, has still not been paid out after more than ten days. In Shanghai, various agencies have only received 15 times the original amount, and some have only received 6 times, leaving employees in dire straits, even worse than before. Yesterday, some agencies received payment notification slips from the National Treasury, and after consulting with the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, they were told that payment would not be made because the payment slip issued by the National Treasury had not yet been received. The 75 times increase, which has been awaited for so long and is only enough to sustain them for a few days, is so near yet so far, causing great panic and indignation among the employees of various agencies. Subsequently, representatives from the Liaison Association of Employees of Central Agencies negotiated with the National Treasury Bureau, and as a result, central agencies originally located in Shanghai that have received the 75 times payment slip can prepare an official letter with the payment slip and submit it to the Director of the National Treasury Bureau for approval, so that they can receive payment in advance.

### Public Education Allowance Announced for This Month: Officials 12,000, Technicians 11,000, Laborers 6,500

[Report from this Newspaper] The commodity allowance and differential allowance for public education personnel for March have been approved by the Municipal Public Education Personnel Commodity Supply Committee yesterday as follows: Officials: Total of 12,000 yuan, including 3 dou of rice, 30 yuan rice allowance. 2 dan of coal briquettes, 7,200 yuan differential allowance. 3 catties of cooking oil, 1,800 yuan differential allowance.

Laborers: Total of 6,500 yuan, including 2 dou of rice, and the rest of the items are half of that of officials.

The committee also resolved the following matters yesterday: (1) In order to expedite the supplementary distribution of overdue coal briquettes to public education personnel, it was decided to appoint Zeng Gangfu, Director of the Municipal Commodity Supply Committee, Xiong Daji, Director of the Coal Briquette Adjustment Office, and Zhuang Zhixuan, representative of the Municipal Audit Office, to form a task force to plan and find ways to advance the distribution.

Request to the Executive Yuan for Prompt Allocation of Oil Funds

(2) Regarding the cooking oil for the four months from December last year to March this year, a request was submitted to the Executive Yuan and a letter was sent to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce requesting the prompt allocation of oil funds. The China Vegetable Oil Factory should continue to distribute physical goods uniformly. Otherwise, the differential allowance will be re-assessed and issued according to the market price. (3) The prices of various in-kind distributions for public education personnel are odd numbers, making it impossible for the retailers to make change. Starting from March, all fractions will be waived. A request will also be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. (4) In addition to the original scheduled supplementary distribution dates, public education purchase certificates will be supplemented on the 14th and 15th of each month after each distribution is completed. (5) The kerosene supply method for January and February will remain the same. If various agencies wish to purchase more than the prescribed quantity, they may also contact the oil company to purchase bulk kerosene after the first supply is completed. The quantity shall not exceed the prescribed supply quantity for each agency for one or two days. (6) Lost purchase certificates cannot be reported as lost. However, if the purchase certificate is stained with water and the writing is unclear, but the number is complete and still distinguishable, making it impossible to receive the allocated items, the service agency may issue an official letter of certification. After verification by the committee, a certificate will be issued to allow the recipient to receive the physical goods.

Distribution of This Month's Purchase Certificates Starts on the 3rd

(7) In the future, the dates for the supplementary distribution of various physical goods will not only be announced by the committee but will also be officially announced by the various supplying agencies in the Shenbao and Central News, two newspapers.

Now that the case has been transferred to the court for investigation by the Control Yuan, I am not in a position to express my opinion during this period. Fortunately, all relevant documents relating to the handling of this case have been transferred to the court for reference. I believe that the truth will come out in a short period of time.

### Dispute over Marriage Contract Involving Zhang Naiqi's Sister: Process from Falling in Love to Broken Relationship Only Lasts Three Months: Both Parties Express Determination to File Lawsuits

[Report from this Newspaper] The conflict between female doctor Zhang Xueqin and her colleague, Dr. Li Ming, due to a breakup in their relationship, has resulted in complaints being filed with the Jing'an Temple Police Precinct. Although mediation has been attempted, both parties have stated that they are determined to file lawsuits in accordance with the law in order to seek a fair resolution. Therefore, this convoluted dispute may have further developments in the coming days.

Zhang is the sister of Zhang Naiqi. She graduated from the Medical Department of Tokyo Imperial University in Japan and served as the Director of the Health Department of the Ningbo Municipal Government. She currently runs a hospital called New Life Hospital. Although she is 36 years old, she is still single. In early November of last year, she frequently visited the Sixth Municipal Hospital for checkups due to high blood pressure and met a Miss Li, a nurse. One day, Li invited Zhang to take a walk in the park. They passed by Li's residence at No. 25, Lane 672, Changle Road, and Li invited her in for a rest. At this time, Zhang suddenly felt unwell. Li said that there was Dr. Li Ming's clinic downstairs and immediately asked Li to come upstairs to give Zhang an injection. Zhang and Li met from then on. From that day on, Li Ming visited Zhang's home every day to treat her illness, showing great concern and warmth, and even buying medicines for Zhang to take, showing extreme diligence. By November 14th, Zhang had received a total of 42 injections, and her illness gradually improved. The 14th was Zhang's birthday, and Li immediately bought incense and gifts

to come and offer congratulations.

Zhang kept him for dinner. After a few drinks, Li expressed his love. After that, they visited each other more often, and their feelings grew stronger. On December 28th, the anniversary of Zhang's mother's death, Li personally brought funerary offerings to pay his respects. That night, he formally proposed marriage to Zhang, and at the same time, he also requested to cohabitate first. Zhang was not in favor of this and told him that love should last a lifetime and the wedding must be held. Li hesitated for a long time and then suggested that they get engaged first during the Lunar New Year, and the ceremony could be dispensed with. Zhang agreed. During the Lunar New Year, Li frankly told Zhang that his economic situation was not good and strongly stated that a fortune teller said that Zhang had "good luck for helping her husband," so he urged her to make an agreement as soon as possible. At the same time, he asked Zhang to draft a marriage contract so that it could be signed and finalized. On the 11th day of the first month, Li came, and Zhang showed him the marriage contract she had written, which included the following words: "We two have the same aspirations and are willing to love each other forever, face national difficulties together, and serve the motherland. If one party breaks the agreement in the future, the other party shall use all of its property as compensation." Li

laughed after reading it

and said: "A sentence can be added to this, that the woman allows the man to freely take concubines." After speaking, he collected the agreement. By this time, it was curfew time. After Li left, it rained and snowed. The next day, he was reported to be bedridden. On the 12th, Zhang, finding it inconvenient to inquire about his illness, sent her cousin, the wife of Liao Gongshao, the former director of the Hongkou Police Precinct, to visit and bring a letter, telling him to take care. Liao's cousin was 29 years old, beautiful and elegant, and studying at a maternity school. Unexpectedly, after she and Li met, Li fell in love with her at first sight, showing her great warmth. After several meetings, she also fell in love. At this time, Zhang's old illness relapsed. In bed, she heard the servant privately discussing the intimacy between Li and Liao's cousin.

This aroused suspicion.

Because Liao had proposed to take his cousin as a concubine, Zhang summoned Liao's cousin to question her strictly. She did not deny it and said: "Mr. Li said that you are so old, why are you still writing love letters? Aren't you ashamed?" At the same time, she said: Liao and Li are both over 40 years old. Instead of marrying Liao as a concubine, it is better to be Li's legal wife. Zhang was almost in despair after hearing this. Afterwards, she tried to find out about Li's past and learned that Li had a wife in his hometown and had already married a daughter-in-law. Li's original name before the victory was Li Ming, and he later changed his name to Li Ming, etc. She believed that Li's behavior was improper, so she decided to go to Li's residence to demand the return of the letter and the marriage contract. When she arrived, Li refused to hand them over, resulting in a conflict. In the chaos, Zhang was also injured by Li's neighbors, Chen Xiangneng and others, and as a result, she was brought to the Jing'an Temple Police Station.

According to Zhang, Li intentionally deceived her and his behavior was despicable. Li, on the other hand, said that Zhang had been engaged to Zhang Tianzhong, the Deputy Director of the Zhabei Police Precinct, before, but the engagement was terminated for some reason. However, Li said that he had told her in detail about his past when they met and had not concealed anything.

### Police Bureau's Economic Section Streamlined to Adapt to New Economic Plan

In addition to merging the gold, currency, food, daily necessities, and fuel groups, the peddlers, special business groups, and economic police team will be retained. The original economic police officers will also be assigned to various precinct stations.

### Jewelers Encounter Pickpockets: Recovered Five Diamond and Emerald Rings

[Report from this Newspaper] Zhou Zhaozhen, a jeweler residing at No. 9, Lane 646, Nanjing West Road, boarded the No. 22 bus in front of the Jindu Grand Theatre on the morning of February 21st. Unexpectedly, a silk bag containing five diamond rings and one emerald ring, worth approximately 2 million yuan, was pickpocketed from his pocket. Zhou reported the case to the Xincheng Police Precinct for investigation. On the 28th, Section Chief Hao of the precinct received a tip that the thief in this case was attending a soup dumpling feast at the home of a Mr. Lu at No. 3, Xingye Li, Linsen West Road. He then ordered officer Wang Xiaofeng to lead the police to the location. As expected, the thief, Shen Qiusheng (age 30, from Zhenjiang), was arrested. Under strict interrogation, he confessed to his accomplices and said that he had sold three large and small diamond rings to Shao Youfang, a watch repair stall owner at the intersection of Linsen Middle Road and Zhongzheng 1st South Road, for 300,000 yuan. The rest were hidden at his home at No. 22, Zhongxian Bridge, Dongfahua Town, and given to an accomplice, etc. Subsequently, the police continued to arrest accomplices Qin Sibao and Li Huizhong, along with the receiver of stolen goods, Shao Youfang. Most of the stolen goods have been recovered, but only four diamond rings and one ring are still being tracked down.

### More US Aid Rice Arrives

[Report from this Newspaper] The Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) in this area had another 1,000 tons of Siamese rice transported from Bangkok by the "Hongzhang" vessel yesterday.

### Relief Society Strained: Eight Soup Kitchens Reduced

[Report from this Newspaper] The Relief Committee of this city operated 19 soup kitchens in various districts of the city during the winter to provide congee, benefiting many poor people in the suburbs. According to past practice, winter congee distribution only lasts until the end of the Lunar New Year. The committee now believes that transportation in the suburbs is inconvenient and difficult, and that some of the staff have been working hard for several months and are physically and mentally exhausted. Furthermore, the monthly requirement of rice is as much as 3,600 stones, and the committee also feels it is difficult to manage. Therefore, it has been decided to close eight of the original soup kitchens from yesterday, adopting a focus approach. The eleven soup kitchens with the most poor people will continue to distribute congee, including five in Zhabei and three each in Nanshi and Yangshupu, with a daily benefit of 43,000 people. These eleven soup kitchens are scheduled to operate for another half month. If there are no problems with the food source, it is hoped that it can be extended to one month.

### Passengers Flying to Taiwan Before the 10th Do Not Need to Apply for Entry Permits

[Report from this Newspaper] The Taiwan Provincial authorities have implemented measures to restrict passenger entry from yesterday, requiring all those going to Taiwan to apply for approval in advance and obtain a permit before they can enter. However, before the 10th of this month, military personnel, government employees, and general passengers traveling to Taiwan on China Airlines flights can still do so without prior application, and only need to have their identification cards. This is because the company, in order to facilitate passengers, instructed the Taipei station to negotiate with the provincial authorities and was granted a special extension of ten days. After the 10th, the company is also working with the authorities to discuss how to simplify the application procedures. In the future, the company may be able to handle entry applications on behalf of passengers at various stations in the country, in order to expedite the process.

### Prices of Eight Public Utilities: Implement Base Number Calculation Method: First Unit Equals 6.25 Cents Customs Gold Unit: Converted to Gold Yuan Based on Previous Day's Customs Gold Unit Price for Payment

[Report from this Newspaper] After the announcement of the financial and economic reform plan, in order to cooperate with the plan to stabilize the prices of various public utilities and to seek fairness in the burden on citizens, the Municipal Government, led by Mayor Wu, Director Zhao, and Zeng Jue, exchanged views with President Liu of the National Bank several times. Based on the principles of the plan, an appropriate pricing method was found. It was decided to set a "Public Utility Calculation Unit," with each unit equivalent to 6.25 cents of the Customs Gold Unit. From now on, the prices of various public utilities in this city will be calculated according to this unit, and the payment will be converted to Gold Yuan coupons based on the Customs Gold Unit price of the previous day. Consumers who wish to prepay can pay the public utility company in advance, but only up to the amount consumed in one month. A few days ago, the Municipal Public Utility Bureau invited representatives from various public utility companies to set the price base numbers. Fang Shangui, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the National Bank, attended the meeting on behalf of President Liu of the Central Bank. After careful review by all parties, the base numbers of various prices were approved and submitted to the mayor for approval. The calculation for water, electricity, gas, and telephone will start from the meter reading on the 1st of this month, and for public transportation, it will be implemented from the 3rd of this month. The various base numbers are as follows:

Shanghai Municipal Public Utility Price List Based on Public Utility Calculation Unit

Water (per cubic meter)

Shanghai Waterworks 〇·二七九

French Tram and Electric Light Company 〇·二七九

Zhabei Water and Electricity 〇·三六二

Inland Waterworks 〇·三六二

Pudong Waterworks 〇·三六二

West Shanghai District (Former Extra-Boundary Roads District) 〇·三六二

Gas

Below 10 Degrees per Degree (Each degree is 100 cubic feet) 〇·六六八 or Below 28 Cubic Meters per Cubic Meter 〇·二三六

Above 10 Degrees Within Limit per Degree 一·一八四 or Above 28 Cubic Meters per Cubic Meter 〇·四一八

Telephone (per call)

〇－一五〇 calls 〇·〇七五

一五一－三〇〇 calls 〇·〇八五

Above 三〇一 calls 〇·〇九五

Trams

First Class 〇·一〇〇 〇·一四〇 〇·一七〇 〇·二一〇 〇·二四〇

Third Class 〇·〇六六七 〇·〇九三三 〇·一一三 〇·一四〇 〇·一六〇

Buses

〇·一〇八 〇·一六二 〇·二一六

〇·二五二 〇·二八八 〇·三二四

Ferries

Across River 〇·一〇八 Long Distance per Person Nautical Mile 〇·一〇八

Small Railway (per person kilometer) 〇·〇六三

Tram monthly and quarterly tickets for March are temporarily sold at 8,000 yuan for ordinary tickets and 4,000 yuan for public education preferential tickets.

Bus monthly and quarterly tickets for March are temporarily sold at 10,000 yuan in Gold Yuan for ordinary tickets and 5,000 yuan for public education preferential tickets.

Calculation Based on the Above Table:

User's Payment = Consumption × Base Number of Each Limit × Gold Yuan Conversion Rate of Public Utility Unit Price.

If the Customs Gold Unit price yesterday was 1120 Gold Yuan coupons, the Public Utility Unit Price would be 700 Gold Yuan.

Multiplying the base number published in the table above by this unit will result in the user's payment. For example, the base price of electricity for the Shanghai Electric Power Company below 10 degrees is 〇·二一一. Multiplying this by 700 is 147.7 Gold Yuan coupons. This 147.7 Gold Yuan coupon is the Gold Yuan coupon price for each degree of electricity within 10 degrees.

### Landlords and Tenants Unite, Making Landlords Retreat: Gu Lin Agrees to Forgo U.S. Dollars and Resolves Dispute with Revised Terms

[Our Report] Over twenty households, including the Phoenix Silk Company located at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Gordon Road, were renting properties from the Russian businessman Gu Lin's real estate company. Due to Gu Lin's demand to raise the rent to US$400 per month per household, the tenants, unable to afford it, petitioned the Land Bureau for intervention. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, Secretary Qian of the Land Bureau convened both the landlord and tenant representatives for mediation. Lawyer Gao Qisun represented Gu Lin, while Lawyer Ma Junshuo represented the tenants. According to Lawyer Gao, the landlord and tenants have reached a settlement: Gu Lin will no longer insist on collecting rent in U.S. dollars. The revised terms are as follows: RMB 8,000 per month for each storefront room, RMB 1,400 per month for each room on the second and third floors, and RMB 1,280 per month for each room on the fourth floor. These amounts will be calculated from last September until the Municipal Government announces new rent standards, after which the new standards will be used. The tenants generally agreed to consider these terms. However, because Lawyer Gao Qisun did not bring Gu Lin's letter of authorization, a written settlement was not reached yesterday. Secretary Qian instructed that another meeting be scheduled to allow both parties to finalize the agreement.

### This Month's Rice Ration Coupons Have Been Distributed to Each District; Certificate No. 7 Must Be Submitted When Claiming Shopping Coupons

According to information from the People's Survey Committee: This office distributed the March household rice ration coupons to each district on February 28, to be fully distributed by March 5. All citizens who registered their household in January of this year and received an ID card should receive this rice ration coupon.

If citizens have lost their ID card due to fire or other reasons, they can be exempted from submitting Certificate No. 7 upon providing proof from the Bao Office or publishing a lost document notice in the newspaper, and the rice coupon will still be issued.

### A Golden Dream Shattered: Female Employee of the Central Trust Bureau Defrauded

[Our Report] The case of Zhou Zheng, Pan Yu, He Ruitang, and others being sued for colluding to defraud through contracting for building construction concluded after Judge Ye Guilin of the District Court held the fourth hearing yesterday morning. The verdict is scheduled for the 8th of this month. According to the plaintiff Hao Mengru (female), she was transferred from the Jinan Central Trust Bureau to the Shanghai Central Trust Bureau's Accounting Department in August of last year. She used her accumulated savings of gold, converted entirely into gold yuan, and, unfamiliar with commercial matters, decided to build a house. She entrusted the defendant Zhou Zheng to build a three-story house on Bao'an Road, agreeing on a price of 390 shih of top-quality white japonica rice. A contract was signed on September 17, with Pan Yu and He Ruitang acting as guarantors. Subsequently, she paid the defendant 220 shih in two installments (equivalent to 4,400 gold yuan at the time). However, months passed, and the defendant had not built the house, nor had he obtained the required building permit or purchased the necessary materials. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the defendant Zhou Zheng was not a construction businessman, and the "China Engineering Company" listed on the receipt was fictitious. Despite repeated inquiries to the defendants, they were evasive and ignored her, even resorting to threats and bullying a vulnerable woman. On January 9, she reported the matter to the Xincheng Police Station, which detained Zhou Zheng. She is suing the defendants for their due punishment and is also filing a civil suit.

### In the Midst of Calls to "Build Hangzhou," Do Not Waste the Great Springtime

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

[Our Report from Hangzhou, 27th] The willows by West Lake are already tinged with light green. The wintersweet has faded, and the spring plums are in bloom. A peach blossom in Yellow Dragon Cave has prematurely bloomed in full. Flocks of wild ducks frolic in West Lake, knowing that this is a warm and intoxicating season. Although nature has not failed Hangzhou, the people living in Hangzhou have shattered their peaceful state of mind, anxiously concerned about current affairs. Indeed, Zhejiang has become the first line of defense in Jiangnan, and Hangzhou is only one step away from the front line. The Communist forces are on the north bank of the Yangtze River, and various counties in Zhejiang are showing signs of unrest. Tiantai was briefly occupied by local communists two days ago, and Sanmen was also once captured. Fuyang and Lin'an, near Hangzhou, often see the appearance of local communists. Rumors spread, inevitably creating a sense of alarm.

Special Elements Everywhere

In Hangzhou, people wearing disheveled military uniforms and civilian clothes are everywhere. It is impossible to determine whether these people belong to formal units or schools. The Hangzhou newspapers call them "special elements." These special elements do nothing all day long, watching movies, sitting in restaurants and teahouses, riding public buses for pleasure, bathing, and getting haircuts, all for free. They even demand money from shop owners after consuming their goods and services. Under these circumstances, barbershops once closed down, bathhouses requested protection, cinemas struggled to survive, and the public bus company considered ceasing operations.

Along with this chaotic scene, theft cases in the city are constantly occurring. Wuya Lane near Ying Bridge, Ping'anfang on Huixing Road, Songmuchang, and Changshouli two days ago have all experienced looting. The latter two cases involved masked thieves armed with wooden-cased guns. All of these cases occurred in February. Although the police authorities have issued strict orders to solve the cases, it will still take some effort.

Scars on the Roads, Dirty Water by the Side

Originally, with the arrival of spring, Hangzhou's merchants should have been revitalizing their businesses. Neon lights would have been lit day and night, and all local products would have been piled high. Almost every store would have had a wireless loudspeaker broadcasting excerpts from Shaoxing opera, filling the city with joy, excitement, and abundance. This spring is indeed somewhat unusual. Stores are not lavishly decorated, and even the uniquely clean and wide Hubin Road, Yingshi Road, and Yanling Road are marred by scars and potholes, with sewage overflowing along the sides of the roads. The rumbling military vehicles and "00" number sedans and jeeps have to drive forcefully on these roads. Not long ago, the lakeside of Hubin Road was full of ten-wheel trucks, with all the food and lodging inside becoming temporary dormitories. Now, they have finally driven away. However, the damage to Hubin Road is unavoidable. Various scenic spots have not been repaired and embellished due to the current situation. There are people coming to Hangzhou to play, some are fleeing and passing through Hangzhou, taking the opportunity to visit the mountains and waters, some are special elements visiting the mountains and waters, and some are coming from Shanghai to enjoy the scenery, but this is a minority. For Hangzhou, which "relies on one spring for three winters," this spring is probably worse than the usual slow season.

Build Hangzhou After Normalcy Returns

In this chaotic time, cultural activities have not fallen behind, such as the performances and exhibitions of the Drama Festival, as well as constant drama performances, music concerts, dance concerts, and various forums. There is also the Zimin Art Institute, which reportedly has departments of music, drama, fine arts, sculpture, and dance. These many cultural activities are in line with the call to build a cultural city. It is said that the landowner of the old site of the West Lake Auditorium is willing to donate the land to build an art gallery and is also willing to donate all the iron window frames of the buildings. The auditorium of the Hubin Public Education Center has been designated by the mayor as a permanent drama theater. However, all the performances have not made money because too many people watch free shows.

Remarkable Work in Eighty Days

After Hangzhou's administrative official Ren Xianqun left, he handed it over to Secretary-General Xu Xiongfei to act as his agent. Xu said to reporters, "I'm just transitional. I still want to go to school to teach in the future." Xu said this, so naturally he won't continue doing this for a long time. Who will succeed him? As of the time this reporter wrote this draft, it is not yet known. However, during Ren's tenure, although it was only a short eighty days, he did do some things, such as adjusting the salaries of public servants and teachers, getting closer to the common people, and repairing streets in the common areas. It was originally heard that not only would the old asphalt roads be paved and renewed, but asphalt roads would also be added. Now that Ren has left, we hope that the new mayor can come and tidy up. Naturally, the new mayor also has other important responsibilities, such as maintaining order and taking care of the lives of ordinary people.

We believe that this chaotic scene is only a temporary state, and it will definitely return to normal soon. We hope that after returning to a normal state, we can build Hangzhou well, and not waste this great springtime, great nature, and great environment!

### A Thrilling Scene: The Hua鎣 Mountain Incident—The Revolt of Several Landlords and Village Chiefs

— Zhang Xiduan

Sichuan is generally regarded as a land of peace and happiness. Unexpectedly, in this land of peace and happiness, especially near Chongqing, the lighthouse of the Anti-Japanese War, internal strife would break out – the Hua鎣 Mountain Rebellion. The name Hua鎣 Mountain initially had no significance, but today it is a term that sends chills down the spines of the people of Chongqing.

The Treasure Trove of Eastern Sichuan

Hua鎣 Mountain is a relatively unfamiliar place because it is located on the borders of several counties and is the source and watershed of several rivers. This mountain is a branch of the Daba Mountains that extends from the northeast border of Sichuan, crossing Quxian, Dazhu, Guang'an, Yuechi, Linshui, Hechuan, and other counties, all the way to the suburbs of Jiangbei, which is separated from Chongqing by water. The mountains are over 600 li long, over 1,500 meters above sea level, and 40 to 80 li thick. The mountains are full of high cliffs, deep ravines, wild trees, and barren forests. Other than the valleys around Juandongmen, there is very little arable land. In the past, there were many temples in the mountains, but now, due to the unstable situation, incense has dwindled, and monks have scattered (only Baoding remains as before). The mountains are rich in resources, but only coal and bamboo for papermaking have been exploited. Because of the small-scale traditional mining methods, production is insignificant. However, the mountains have thick forests and abundant minerals. From an economic point of view, Hua鎣 Mountain is the "treasure trove" of eastern Sichuan and the "blessed land" of Sichuan.

However, the continuous presence of local communists, coupled with this year's political rebellion, has turned this blessed land into a "drag" on eastern Sichuan.

Difficult to Attack and Defend

Hua鎣 Mountain is so deep, barren, and dangerous. The fan-shaped spread of the Jialing River, Qu River, and Fu River in the southwest further increases the complexity of the mountains. The political jurisdictions of various counties are intertwined, making contact and management difficult, forming a lawless zone. For many years, the mountain area has been a paradise for fugitives. In addition, the richness of the riverside and plains provides unparalleled convenience to petty criminals. However, the mountains are high, the forests are dense, and there is a lot of fog, making it difficult to attack and defend. It is extremely difficult for suppressors to attack and communicate, and supplies are not easy to obtain, making it unsuitable for long-term stationing. For local communists, without a good base, hiding is also not easy.

Wealthy Gentry Rising Up

The leading figures in this Hua鎣 Mountain rebellion were all from the bourgeoisie or local administrative cadres. In theory, these people should be the targets of the Communist Party's liquidation, but they actually initiated the uprising. Isn't that strange!

Now let's describe these characters.

The first to rise up was Zhang Shujun, the current village chief of Fulong Township in Hedong, Yuechi County. He is 22 years old and a wealthy gentry with over 2,000 mu of land. He once served as the district leader of the Three Principles of the People Youth League. His father was brutally murdered by the local communists, so his family built a strong fortress and hired guards, equipped with guns and cannons (including machine guns and submachine guns). It is said that Zhang personally led his guards to capture and kill local communists not long before the uprising. However, on the evening of August 21, he suddenly gathered his tenants and publicly burned all the land deeds and a large amount of clothing to show that the land was collectively owned and to share weal and woe, thereby gaining the support of the tenants. The next day, he formally started the uprising. The person who incited him to revolt was his brother-in-law, Chen Zheng from Hechuan (formerly the chairman of the Chongqing University Student Union). Participants in the uprising included some nearby village heads, elementary school principals, teachers, and over 300 farmers. There was also Yang Xiqin. Yang was the principal of Yuechi New Third Middle School. This school was founded by Yu Youren to commemorate his father's business in Yuechi. Their unit designation was the Seventh Detachment of the Democratic Allied Army Hua鎣 Mountain Column, with Yang Xiqin as the political instructor and Zhang as the detachment commander.

Village Chief Jinzi

The second revolt was Chen Bochun, the village chief of Jinzi Township in Hechuan. He was 26 years old and had studied at Jinling University. He joined the Communist Party because of his lover and his brother-in-law Luo Youxin (a graduate of Shanbei University). During his time in the village, he used the slogan of resisting soldiers and refusing grain, winning the support of the villagers. Later, when the Hechuan County Chief suspected him, he ordered the village to re-elect the village chief four times, but he was still elected. Later, because he was exposed for going to Chongqing to collect a wireless radio, he started the uprising on August 25. With him were the three townships of Gulou, Shengxi, and Qiantang, with a total of over 400 people and guns, organized into three rifle companies, one pistol company, and one machine gun squad, calling themselves the Fourth Detachment of the Democratic Allied Army Hua鎣 Mountain Column. Chen served as the detachment commander.

Councilors Participate

The third was Wang Pingfan, a councilor from Wusheng County. Wang was the former village chief of Shipan Township in the county. He was 32 years old and had 500 to 600 mu of land. When Chen Bochun led people and guns north along the border between Nanchong and Yuechi to meet him, he also started an uprising on August 27, with a total of over 300 people and guns. The unit designation was the Third Detachment of the Democratic Allied Army East Sichuan Column, with Wang as the detachment commander.

According to the confessions of the captured people and other intelligence, it was confirmed that they had planned to launch simultaneously. It was estimated that at least 5,000 to 6,000 people could be mobilized, preparing to establish three guerrilla bases between Hua鎣 Mountain, Hecheng Mountain, and Wuhe Mountain, and then expand outwards. Later, because they were detected by the government, they were forced to act hastily. There was also another Communist Party member using the alias Lao Tian who personally commanded, originally scheduled to launch in Quxian, Longtan, Juandong, Huidong, and other villages during last year's Mid-Autumn Festival, expecting 1,800 people and guns, attempting to attack Dazhu or Quxian County to obtain weapons and ammunition. As a result, the uprising was launched as scheduled. On the evening of the 20th, only 300 people attended the evening party in Dengjiawan. The participating cadres were nearby village heads, deputy village team leaders, elementary school principals, teachers, etc. The slogans at the evening party were "Divide the land," "Abolish debts," "No conscription," "No grain tax," and five or six village women sang songs and sang specially made lyrics. The unit designation was the Sixth Column of the Sichuan People's Liberation Army, with Lao Tian as the detachment commander, He Shang as the chief of staff, and Lao Fan as the commander of the Third Detachment.

Coercion with Guns

When the uprising began, Zhang Shujun crossed the Qu River to the west, and Chen Bochun and Wang Pingfan joined forces and went north along the border between Nanchong and Yuechi, coercing people with guns along the way. Local transportation was blocked, and various county towns built street-fighting fortifications. At night, every household closed their doors. The Nanchong Police Chief was beaten to death, and several county chiefs were reprimanded as a result. At that time, it was impossible to estimate their military strength, and terror and rumors spread among the people. The people were not afraid of the Communist Party, but of the war. They completely lost confidence in the strength of the government. Even in Chongqing, there was a sense of impending doom.

A Terrorized Area

At that time, the area of Hechuan, Nanchong, Wusheng, Quxian, Guang'an, and Dazhu was filled with terror and riots. The county governments also dispatched police teams and militia forces, but they were mostly passive due to the lack of ammunition and appropriate unified command. The Second Corps of the Internal Police General Team sent by Chongqing had only two companies. The Min Company engaged Zhang Shujun's troops in a fierce battle in Heier Township, Wusheng, for two hours, killing their political instructor Yang Xiqin and Zhang's brother Chen Zheng on the spot. In the pouring rain, they abandoned more than ten corpses, and a part of them fled in a panic with weapons. This battle became a sedative for stabilizing the situation.

Hidden Worries Have Not Disappeared

Afterwards, Director Zhu of the Pacification Office also sent the commander of the Second Corps of the Internal Police General Team, Peng Bin, to serve as the commander of the Hua鎣 Mountain area in Hechuan, Wusheng, and other eleven districts, and a part of the large army. Peng arrived in the Hua鎣 Mountain area on September 8. He issued a simple proclamation: "Those captured in front of the battle will be killed, and those who surrender will be allowed to reform." On one hand, he closely deployed and commanded the troops to encircle and suppress. In less than thirty days, he summoned and surrendered more than 700 people, captured more than 300 alive, shot more than 40 people, and seized more than 300 various guns. The Chen Bochun and Zhang Shujun troops were completely disintegrated. Chen and Zhang fled without being captured. Wang Pingfan committed suicide after going blind. Only a few dozen people are still hiding in the mountains.

The Hua鎣 Mountain rebellion has been quelled, but this land is still an uneasy place. The future troubles cannot be said to be completely eliminated. There are many civilian guns in the southwestern provinces, at least tens of millions in each county. If these weapons can be used well, they may be a strong force, otherwise they are also endless hidden worries, because natural disasters, political misfortunes, poor politics, and various other reasons cause the people to take risks. If political activities are added, it will be triggered immediately. Even if it is fortunately quelled, the loss of life and property is irreparable.

### Reader Consulting Legal Interpretation: A Wandering Traveler Is Exhausted; Random Medicine Casting Kills a Person

Wang Qichang asks: My younger brother, Wang Qiming, 21 years old, serves in the First Company of the People's Service Corps of the Ministry of National Defense. In September of this year, because his nostrils often bled, he asked for leave to return to Huaiyin for recuperation. Unexpectedly, Huaiyin was evacuated again on December 2. He traveled alone south. He suffered from wind, frost, hunger, and cold for ten days on the road and was also pushed down and trampled. He arrived in Zhen on the afternoon of the 11th. His body was very weak, and he had slight chest pain, but he was still able to sit and walk and was not bedridden. After staying at a relative's house for one night, he ate thin rice porridge and glucose on the 2nd. In the afternoon, he took a rickshaw to Zhen Enpei Hospital for treatment. Dr. Gao Enpei of the hospital only used a stethoscope and did not examine the various parts of his body in detail, nor did he measure his temperature. He immediately concluded that it was lobar pneumonia and immediately prescribed medicine, tablets, and an injection (the type of medicine is unknown), and then immediately injected penicillin. When he was returning, his eyes were already dim. He died after about an hour. (1) The doctor failed to diagnose in detail, nor did he ask for a relative's insurance policy. It can be seen that the condition was not dangerous, but he recklessly used the medicine, causing death. Should he be held legally responsible? (2) The doctor demanded a handling fee of ninety-six yuan the morning after his death, only knowing how to get money and neglecting human life. Moreover, there have been five or six cases of negligent homicide this year, and he has been accused in the record. What punishment should this doctor receive?

[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers] (1) Whether the doctor is liable for negligent death should be determined by whether the result of his diagnosis is consistent with the medicine he used. (2) The doctor's request for medical expenses or handling fees is the remuneration he should receive for his business and has nothing to do with his liability for negligent death. If the doctor is indeed guilty of negligent death, you can sue him according to law and ask the prosecutor to investigate.

### After the Issuance of Four New Banknotes, the National Bank Fully Implements Tight Monetary Policies, Selling Gold, Foreign Exchange, Gauze, etc., Exceeding 600 Million Yuan

To adapt to the actual needs, the Central Bank yesterday (the 1st) began issuing large banknotes of 1,000 yuan and 500 yuan denominations. However, the number issued was not large, so the shortage of banknotes in the market has not been resolved. It is reported that the Central Bank does not intend to release large amounts of large banknotes in order to tighten credit. As of yesterday (the 1st), the deposit balances of various banks and firms were still subject to a 30% limit.

After the authorities announced the tightening of the issuance of Gold Yuan Certificates, the Central Bank issued four types of large banknotes yesterday. Among them, there are two types of 1,000-yuan notes, one printed by the Central Printing Plant and the other printed by the Chung Hwa Book Company. There are two types of 500-yuan notes, one from the Central Printing Plant and the other from the Chung Hwa Book Company. At the same time as the issuance of the four types of large banknotes, the Central Bank made every effort to tighten monetary policy yesterday in order to suppress the skyrocketing of prices after the issuance of the large banknotes, and also sold huge amounts of foreign exchange transfer certificates and gold. As a result, the tight monetary situation became even more severe, and the black market interest rate rose to 90%. All commodity prices were forced to remain the same. The financial market, such as gold and foreign exchange, also hovered at the original price of the previous day.

[Another Dispatch] After the issuance of the large banknotes, morale in all sectors was boosted, and there was a unanimous expectation for price increases. All markets showed strength in the morning, but the financial authorities made preparations in advance and sold large quantities of gold, securities, gauze, and foreign exchange transfer certificates in various markets, amounting to more than 600 million yuan. Commodity prices then declined and were roughly equal to the previous level. In the past two days, the monetary authorities have tightened monetary policy by as much as 1.2 billion yuan. The money market was extremely tight yesterday. Black market interest rates initially appeared at 70 to 80 yuan, and rose to 90 yuan near noon. Due to the lack of funds in all sectors, the momentum of price increases was suppressed. According to market observers, it will be difficult for monetary conditions to ease within the day, and prices will not rise significantly.

### Large Fluctuations in Gold Prices Make Business Difficult for Gold Shops

[Report from Our Newspaper] The gold market's trend yesterday went from decline to prosperity. At the initial opening, it hovered around the 149,000 to 151,000 mark. Then, because large banknotes had not yet been issued, and the tight monetary situation remained, the black market interest rate once soared to 90%. The lowest price was seen at 137,000 to 139,000. At noon, it closed at 140,000 to 142,000. In the afternoon, the market was volatile, with large fluctuations. However, as monetary conditions eased slightly, the trend was firm. The highest price was once 160,000 to 162,000, and it finally closed at 158,000 to 160,000.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The member gold shops of the Shanghai Gold Shop Association resumed formal business operations yesterday, with all members divided into three groups to coordinate market prices. However, because the gold market fluctuated greatly yesterday, the number of times the listed price changed was also high. It is estimated that the market price of 155,000 yuan per tael for selling and 145,000 yuan per tael for buying in the morning lasted longer. The lowest price for the whole day was 146,000 yuan for selling and 136,000 yuan for buying. In the afternoon, the gold market rose, and the listed price also rose step by step. Finally, the highest price of the day was listed, with 165,000 yuan for selling and 153,000 yuan for buying. The cost of exchanging old gold jewelry for new gold jewelry yesterday was set at 5,000 yuan per tael. Generally, gold shops' business was quite prosperous, and the business principle was mostly to balance buying and selling. However, many also sold short, seeing that the tight monetary situation had not eased. According to a certain authority in the industry who told reporters, given the trend of the gold market yesterday, gold shops found it quite difficult to do business. The listed price often could not correspond to the rapidly changing market price. Therefore, the difference between the buying and selling prices in the morning was only 10,000 yuan per tael, but in the afternoon, because the market fluctuated too violently, the buying and selling prices had to be raised to 12,000 yuan.

### Sudden Tightening of Monetary Conditions Leads to Chaotic Bidding for Black Market Interest Rates

Transactions Made at as High as 100 Yuan

Due to the impact of large overnight differences in bank and firm positions and widespread rumors in the market that remittances from other cities were being withheld and that the National Bank was selling large amounts of foreign exchange certificates, the money market suddenly tightened yesterday morning. The asking prices for general overnight lending rates were extremely chaotic in the morning. The lowest price was 60 yuan, but the highest was 90 to 100 yuan. Around 10 o'clock, the overnight lending rate gradually became uniform, averaging between 70 and 80 yuan. Because all sectors heard the news of the Central Bank's large banknote issuance, everyone was searching for funds and hoarding goods, so the shortage of funds in the market was very serious. The average black market overnight interest rate in each market was around 80 to 90 yuan. Among them, the black market interest rate in the noodle, flour, silk, and other markets was as high as 90 yuan due to the lack of supply. The asking price in the cotton yarn market was low at first and then high. The asking price in the morning was between 70 and 80 yuan, but after 11 o'clock, due to the difficulty of borrowing and lending, the black market interest rate also rose to around 90 yuan. Off-exchange interest in the securities exchange was 75 to 80 yuan.

### The National Bank Decides to Expand the Organization of the Open Market Committee

In order to curb rising prices, the Central Bank has decided to sell as much material as possible, including gold, silver, securities, and foreign exchange certificates, and to set up a separate organization to be responsible for the sales. After President Liu returned to Shanghai, he frequently consulted with the heads of various departments and exchanged views with the financial community. As a result, it has been decided to expand the organization of the Open Market Committee. The heads of national banks and bureaus will all participate in order to strengthen the force. It is reported that the committee can be established within this week. Before its establishment, the Central Bank will take action at any time depending on the market situation.

### The China Textile Construction Corporation Sells a Large Amount of Cloth and Receives Nearly 300 Million Yuan in Gold Yuan Certificates

[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Textile Construction Corporation sold cloth yesterday as usual, with a total of 15 types of cloth. A total of 13,760 bolts of cloth, 15,000 pounds of leftover cloth, and 24,800 yards were sold, totaling 282,210,000 yuan in Gold Yuan Certificates.

Narrow Fluctuations in Cotton Yarn

The cotton yarn market was mostly brewing yesterday, with very little change. At the initial opening, due to the impact of the large banknote issuance, traders unanimously called for higher prices. Then, because monetary conditions tightened and demand from all parties was mediocre, the market relaxed near the close.

The 42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 920,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan higher than before. The closing price fell to 900,000 yuan, the same as the previous day. The 40-count Blue Phoenix closed down 30,000 yuan, and the 32-count Silver Moon closed down 10,000 yuan.

The 21-count Double Horse spot goods once broke the 600,000 yuan mark, but finally fell back to 570,000 yuan at the close. The factory order rose slightly by 5,000 yuan to 535,000 yuan. The 20-count Double Horse remained at the original level of 530,000 yuan from the previous day. The other grades softened, and the 16-count changed very little.

The Cloth Market Trend Turns Soft

The cloth market trend turned slightly soft. In the early morning, due to reports of the issuance of 500-yuan and 1,000-yuan banknotes, the general psychology was boosted, but because monetary conditions in the industry tightened, those in need of funds came out one after another, leading to a decline in the market price. Near noon, it was heard that the Textile Construction Corporation was only selling second-class fine cloth and Yuan Bijin, and the situation of falling prices recovered and rebounded. As a result, it was slightly lower than before.

The Longtou fine cloth opened at 22,200 yuan, and then rose to 22,500 yuan, then fell to 21,300 yuan, and closed at 22,000 yuan at noon, down 1,000 yuan.

The highest price for the Sijunzi Yuan Bijin was from 20,500 yuan to 20,900 yuan. Before the close, it was slightly lower to 20,300 yuan, and finally 20,600 yuan, down 400 yuan. The Sijunzi Yuan Zhigong was only down 50 yuan. In the afternoon, off-exchange asking prices rose, and it was heard that the Sijunzi Yuan Bijin was 22,500 yuan.

### The National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee Decides to Actively Store and Purchase Raw Cotton

[Report from Our Newspaper] The National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee held a routine meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss four important matters: (1) In order to support cotton farmers and replenish raw cotton reserves, the committee decided to request the Central Bank to allocate funds sufficient to purchase and store 180,000 dan of raw cotton (approximately 20 billion yuan) in the near future in order to actively purchase cotton and entrust the Textile Construction Corporation to spin cotton yarn.

(2) The cotton stored in Hankou and Xi'an can be shipped to Shanghai one after another.

### The National Bank Posts Exchange Rate for US Dollars: 2,650 Gold Yuan Certificates per Dollar

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the new financial plan, foreign currency notes are still prohibited from circulation. The Central Bank should calculate the exchange rate for foreign currency based on the market price of gold and the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates. It is learned that the Central Bank began posting exchange rates yesterday (the 1st) for the purchase of US dollars, with the rate set at 2,650 Gold Yuan Certificates per US dollar. This price is only for buying, not selling. The exchange rates for other countries' currencies are calculated proportionally.

### Excessive Negative Interest Rates Make it Difficult to Boost Buying Sentiment, and A-Shares Continue to Show Weakness

Yesterday, the Central Bank issued new Gold Yuan Certificates of 500 yuan and 1,000 yuan denominations. The response of the Shanghai A-share market not only did not show an increase, but generally showed a soft trend. At the initial opening, due to tight monetary conditions, all stocks opened weakly. However, the state-owned Taiwan Sugar Corporation continued to reach new highs, trading at 23,570 yuan, reaching the eighth daily limit increase. Thereafter, because the trend fluctuated, both bulls and bears dared not take action easily, so the market trend became more and more downward. Yongxin Spinning opened at 3.25 yuan, following the fluctuations of off-exchange gold. The highest price was 3.41 yuan. At 11:30, the asking price for off-exchange gold gradually decreased, and the speculators in the ring increased the pressure at a high level, and retail investors generally held a wait-and-see attitude. The market became lower and lower, and the smallest price was once 3.17 yuan. At the close, because off-exchange gold was slightly higher, people's morale was slightly boosted, and the market trend returned to 3.22 yuan. The initial opening price of Meiya was 1.35 yuan. Because the Yongxin Spinning market showed a sideways trend, most retail investors concentrated on Meiya transactions, and the market trend was pulled up, with a high price of 1.50 yuan. However, because the black market interest rate was high, retail investors could not afford it, and they turned from buying to selling one after another. At 12:30, it finally fell to 1.36 yuan at the close. Among the small stocks that reached the daily limit increase, there were only three types: Yongye Real Estate at 74.3 yuan, Xinya at 0.86 yuan, and Zhenhua at 1.21 yuan.

### Foreign Shares Continue to Reach New Highs

The off-exchange foreign shares market continued to show a high trend. Although monetary conditions in the industry were tight, people's morale was still very boosted, and the buying intention of all groups was strong. Among them, the foreign firm group had the strongest buying appetite, so new highs continued to be seen in various stocks. Yisha traded at 6,300 yuan and 6,400 yuan. British Union traded at 6,700 yuan. Yipi traded at 950 yuan and 1,050 yuan. The Steel Industry Corporation traded at 1,450 yuan. China Paperboard traded at 1,200 yuan. Jardine Matheson traded at 18,000 yuan, up 1,000 yuan from the previous day.

### Market Strolls

— From the Balcony of an Observer

Gold Shops Reopen with Smiles and Shakes of the Head

The gold shop industry has fully reopened, and everyone is excitedly trying to make up for the losses during the shutdown.

However, I asked several shopkeepers, "What good business is there to do?" Some replied with a smile, some shook their heads, and some sighed and said, "Just get by; if we can't get by, we still have to get by."

The reality is right in front of everyone. Although the listed prices for buying and selling are posted, most of the transactions are selling. May I ask what to use to respond to the market?

Of course, with the door open, you can tap on the telephone; you can go back and forth with nothing, and try your luck. This is what people who smile mean without saying a word.

In fact, opening the door can create another dream. That is, if there are no goods to respond to the market, you can collectively request the Central Bank to allocate real goods. Once the dream is over, I am afraid it will be time to prepare to close the shop again.

The market price of American silver is about 70 cents per ounce, so it is not a loss to buy the Yuan head silver coin when the market price is below 70% of the US dollar price. When it is above 70%, there is always a chance to make up for it by selling.

For example, yesterday the highest market price of a US dollar was 3,150 yuan, and the Yuan head price at 70% discount was 2,100 yuan. Also, the lowest price of a US dollar was 2,750 yuan, and the equivalent Yuan head price was about 1,900 yuan. If calculated according to the Central Bank's posted price, it is close.

Yesterday, the Central Bank posted the exchange rate for the first time at 2,650 yuan per US dollar, but with the addition of the daily interest rate of 100 yuan, it was 2,890 yuan.

The US dollar is pegged to the price of gold, and Shanghai is used to calculating 50 yuan to one tael. Because they use this to calculate that, as long as they mess around in this triangular relationship, who is willing to do serious business?

Who Is Willing to Do Serious Business While Getting into the Triangle of Gold, Banknotes, and Yuan Head Silver Coins?

Affected by the Issuance of Large Banknotes, Rice Prices Once Strengthened. Subsequent Tight Monetary Conditions Led to a Fall in Prices. Flour Prices Stopped Rising and Turned Weak. The Oil Market Declined Slightly

The rice market was boosted by the introduction of large banknotes, and people's morale was high. The owners took the opportunity to raise prices, and the early opening rose by more than 1,000 yuan. In the subsequent market, due to tight monetary conditions and high black market interest rates, sellers were eager to sell, and prices fell back. The North City market's white rice was 16,000 yuan, up 200 yuan, and early Bo rice was down slightly by 100 yuan. The South City market's white rice and Bo rice were each 16,000 yuan, up slightly by 200 to 300 yuan. A total of 7,266 dan of goods arrived at the North and South markets yesterday.

Edible Oil

Although transactions were very firm due to the issuance of large banknotes, the market atmosphere was weak due to tight monetary conditions, and prices hovered and declined slightly. At the initial opening, soybean oil and rapeseed oil were both stable. At the close, soybean oil fell by 2,000 yuan, raw rapeseed oil was slightly weaker by 1,000 yuan, and Jiangbei old barrel raw oil was 72,000 yuan, and then 70,000 yuan. Refined rapeseed oil and small cart sesame oil both fell by 2,000 yuan, and soybean cake fell sharply by 1,000 yuan.

Wheat Flour

The upward trend turned weak due to tight monetary conditions and high black market interest rates. Buyers were cautious, and actual sales were quite sluggish. The old truck retreated to the 7,000 mark, and the Warship fell by 400 yuan, closing low at 6,630 yuan. After the close, monetary conditions became even tighter, and the interest rate reached 90%. The sellers were eager to sell, and the market was full of selling voices. The market trend was again slightly lower: Hongfeng and Peacock are now at 6,600 yuan, Jiancheng at 6,500 yuan, and Dafa at 6,650 yuan. Bran supply and demand were scarce, and the market trend was slightly up. Daxin brand is now at 5,650 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

Prices rose and fell differently. Due to tight monetary conditions, owners were eager to sell. Yellow soybeans generally fell by 10%, and oil mills' appetite was weak. Zha soybeans fell by 2,000 yuan, and Che soybeans fell by 10%. Raw kernels and sesame seeds were the only ones that had a strong appetite, and it was heard that large banknotes were being issued, and people's morale was firm, and the market trend continued to be firm. Hankou white sesame rose sharply by nearly 20%, and Linhuai Pass raw kernels rose again by 2,000 yuan. Corn and Green Gang were watching, and actual sales turned sluggish. Market prices fell by 300 to 500 yuan each. Red grains generally fell by 500 yuan, and green beans also saw a downward trend.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hongzhang ship returned to Shanghai from Bangkok yesterday, carrying 963 tons of US aid rice, a total of 10,000 bags, and docked at Zhongzhan Wharf for unloading.

The Zhongkai ship carried 2,200 tons of sugar, and the Jiaoren ship carried 1,800 tons of sugar, all docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf for unloading. All of the above sugar is from the Taiwan Sugar Corporation.

### Not Much Tea Trading

The tea reserves in this city are empty, and the trend is struggling in gasps, and is still trying to struggle. Prices are consistently hovering at peak levels. According to general opinion, the cost of tea will inevitably increase, so the future has a tendency to rise easily and difficult to fall. As for yesterday's market transactions, there is still an imbalance between sales and purchases, and only a few transactions are made.

### Silk Hovers

The silk market situation hovered yesterday, with very little rise and fall. Initially, due to the tight monetary conditions and the black market interest rate rising to 80 or 90 yuan, retail investors sold to realize cash, and the market trend weakened. Then, it was rumored that the issuance of large banknotes was imminent, remittances from various places were being suppressed, and the tight monetary situation could be resolved, so there were still many pull-ups. However, as the tight monetary situation intensified, some traders frequently closed their positions, and the market turned into a sideways trend near the close. No. 120 Youguang new goods opened at a low price. After the opening, it was heard that the price of gold was falling step by step, and people's hearts were weak, so the market trend was unable to rise. The asking price was still waiting at a low level. Then, it was rumored that remittances from other places were being suppressed, and people's hearts turned firm, and the bullish psychology became active again. The asking price immediately rose from the 700,000 yuan range to 760,000 yuan at the close. In the afternoon, it was heard that monetary conditions eased slightly, and the price of gold also rebounded, and people's morale improved. At one point, the asking price rose to 800,000 yuan, but finally closed at 780,000 yuan. Raw silk yesterday was due to tight monetary conditions, the foreign exchange transfer certificate trend was stable, off-exchange prices were still flat, and people's hearts were weak. Superior grade zero-load opened at 920,000 and 930,000 yuan. In the middle, the price of gold fell step by step, and the market trend softened, once as low as 890,000 yuan. After the low, it was rumored that the issuance of large banknotes was imminent, and the tight monetary situation would be resolved, so people's morale was boosted, and the market price rebounded. Near noon, it closed at 910,000 yuan, slightly down 10,000 yuan. The silk market trend was stable yesterday. The city's monetary conditions carried on the huge difference in the positions of the banks and bureaus the day before, and the turnover of various industries suddenly became tight. However, it was rumored that the issuance of large banknotes made people optimistic, but because after the opening, the monetary conditions became tighter and tighter, and the black market interest rate rose from 70 yuan to 90 yuan, retail investors were unable to bear the burden, and the intention to sell was stronger, so the market trend was flat first and then weak. The initial opening price of Meiya was 510,000 yuan. Then, because the off-exchange gold price was step by step low, the market trend was unable to support it, and it immediately retreated to the 500,000 mark, and hovered at a low level for a long time. Until near the close, most of the fund shortages had been arranged smoothly, and the vitality turned slightly, and the market trend slightly improved, and finally closed at 508,000 yuan at noon.

### The Four Mines Joint Operating Office Adjusts Coal Prices Again

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Four Mines Joint Operating Office adjusted coal prices again yesterday. The special prices are as follows: Keelung coal 56,600 yuan, white coal nuggets 55,000 yuan, white coal lumps 83,000 yuan, white coal dust 50,000 yuan, foreign bituminous coal no goods, no market.

### Leping Coal Arrives One After Another, and the Supply is Expected to Improve

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to a person in charge of the bituminous coal allocation office who told reporters, the arrival of coal from various places in February was barely enough. A total of 11,700 tons of Kailuan coal, 15,760 tons of Soviet coal, and 52,713 tons of coal were received. The above totals 80,173 tons. In fact, the city needs 90,000 tons per month, and the Nanjing area also relies on the city for supply, needing 30,000 tons per month. The shortage still needs to be made up. However, starting from this month, Leping coal can arrive one after another, and it is estimated that 60,000 tons can arrive per month. In addition to Taiwan coal, the supply situation is expected to improve. The Four Mines Joint Operating Office has negotiated with the city's Shipping Association to lease 10 ships to transport Leping coal south in rotation. Among them, the Greater Shanghai and Tangshan ships have already begun transportation. The remaining eight ships, including Guangdong Dong, Haitian, Huaxin, Nanquang, Yongxing, Tianping, Fuxiang, and Taian, can also set sail one after another.

The Russian ship Baronono, represented by Maotai Company, transported more than 8,000 tons of coal from Vladivostok and arrived at the port at around 3 p.m. yesterday, and is now berthed at Dongjiadu Zhongzhan Wharf for unloading.

### Tung Oil Was Firm First and Then Returned

The tung oil market yesterday appeared with a firm and profitable attitude from the morning opening, and the market rose sharply. Because after the index rose sharply, the eight major public utilities are also brewing price increases. At the same time, it was heard that the source of tung oil in Hankou and other places has been blocked, and at present it only relies on a small number of supplies from Wenzhou and Lanxi, so people's morale has progressed, and the asking price is endless. However, until the afternoon, stimulated by tight monetary conditions and the arrival of off-exchange materials, it was unable to support it and turned soft, and compared with the previous day, it was lacking in glory.

### The Glory of Malayan Chinese: Badminton Champions of the World

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] This is a glorious page in the history of Chinese sports. The Malayan Chinese team has won the Thomas Cup, the world badminton championship, bringing the world champion silver cup back from Scotland to keep until 1952, when they will compete with the world's strongest teams again. Chinese sports have never been able to compete in world competitions, but these few Malayan Chinese compatriots have actually won the world championship, which is a truly glorious achievement.

Badminton is suitable for people of all ages and genders, and can be played in all seasons. Tennis players can use it as an indoor activity in the cold season. Badminton is especially popular in Southeast Asia, where the Chinese are so passionate about it that they have produced many outstanding players. Malayan players have long had world-class standards and are famous around the world. It was expected that they would reach the top this time. I remember when the Seventh National Games were held in Shanghai last May, the Malayan Chinese delegation brought three badminton stars, who were also the heroes of this Thomas Cup victory. These three were: Huang Defu, Huang Bingshun, and Yang Guangcai. The overseas Chinese were preparing to invite them to perform their skills for the people of the country to improve the level of badminton in the country. Unfortunately, at that time, everyone was busy with other programs in the National Games and did not pay enough attention to these three world-class players. The publicity in various newspapers was also insufficient, so they quietly performed in the gymnasium and then left. The brilliance of the performance at that time, the superb skills, were truly breathtaking, defeating several Shanghai representatives such as Hong Dequan, Hou Shuji, and Li Guofan, leaving them unable to resist.

The Thomas Cup was initiated by Sir Thomas, the previous British badminton champion, who donated the cup. It is held every four years, with countries from all over the world participating in regional competitions, similar to the Davis Cup system. It consists of five singles and four doubles matches, with the team that wins five out of nine matches winning. Since the Malayan Chinese team participated in the competition, they have defeated all their opponents along the way, with countries bowing down in admiration. In the end, they replayed the match with the United States, which was held in Glasgow with more than 3,000 spectators. Sir Thomas personally attended the event, and tickets were sold out weeks in advance, creating an unprecedentedly grand scene. As a result, the Malayan Chinese team defeated the United States with a score of 6-3, gaining the right to compete in the final with Denmark. Among them, the American main player Freeman, who was also the world badminton singles champion, defeated Huang Defu and Huang Bingshun in fierce battles. Freeman had never lost a set in ten years, and this time, the Malayan Chinese champion Huang Defu actually won a set against him, which was a remarkable feat. On the 26th, the Malayan Chinese team competed for the championship with Denmark in Lancashire, and again won with a score of 8-1, severely defeating the Dutch army, causing global attention. Before the game, because the second singles player Huang Bingshun injured his arm and could not play, the Dutch army underestimated the Malayan Chinese team and even declared that anyone could replace him, to show their generosity. However, the Malayan Chinese team still had the third singles player Luo Defu replace him, and he actually defeated the Dutch first-ranked player Sgaropp, which was a great achievement. The Dutch army was almost completely wiped out.

The Malayan Chinese team is fighting for honor for the motherland overseas, and we here remotely congratulate them on their victory.

### Basketball League Second Round: Ren Yu Defeats Mai Lings Again, Several Ties, Difference of Three Goals, Exquisite Performance, Tense Game

[Report from Our Newspaper] The second round of the Division A Basketball League began last night. Ren Yu met Mai Lings again. After 40 minutes of fierce battle, it was difficult to determine the winner. Ren Yu finally defeated Mai Lings again with a score of 52-46. In the first half, Ren Yu was ahead by four points with a score of 25-21. Both sides demonstrated extremely clear and beautiful basketball skills. Ren Yu's shooting was particularly smooth last night, and they were able to score with ease. Wu Xinyun, Xu Zhongyi, and Sun Guozheng, the three musketeers, stood out and scored the most points. Mai Lings has many talents and is well-rounded, with tall players who scored many points through high-ball passes. It was not easy for Ren Yu to overcome the difficulties in this environment with low-ball tactics. Mai Lings improved each time, and although they lost, their performance was quite remarkable. Two games in Division B: (1) Hui Li B defeated Hua Nan by a large margin, 63-35, with the first half score being 24-22. (2) Xi Qing Basketball defeated Typhoon, 32-30, with the first half score being 18-13.

In the first 20 minutes, Mai Lings led by 1-2 points and 2-3 points in the first 10 minutes, before the score tied at 12 each, making the game extremely tense. In the second 10 minutes, Mai Lings played with their formal lineup, but it was still difficult to distinguish the winner, and there were ties at 16, 19, and a total of six times. Ren Yu started to break through, taking the lead with 25-21 in the first half. At the start of the battle, Ren Yu sent Yao Wenyi, Shen Pengju, Cai Jindian, Li Zhaohe, and Xu Zhongyi onto the court. Mai Lings' Brahman opened the scoring, and Ren Yu's Zhongyi and Jindian responded with three points. Gu Dihuaerfu added two goals, and Cai and Xu tied the score at 6 each. Punk Kiddong showed his color again, and Mai Lings led again with 8-6. Zhaohe and Peng made one free throw each, surpassing the score with 9-8. Zhongyi made a free throw, and Ounas tied the score at 10. Ren Yu's passing was brilliant, and they continued to tie the score at 12. Mai Lings began to bring on their formal good players, with Remsay, Rees, Coffins, Frote, and Jockson entering one after another. Ren Yu was still able to hold their ground. Russia tied the score at 16, and Remsay and Lees scored, with Sun Guozheng pulling the score to 19 each (this was the sixth tie). Guozheng showed his skills under the basket, and Xinyun followed suit. Ren Yu's players made contributions one after another, finally allowing them to breathe. In the first half, Ren Yu led by four points with a score of 25-21.

In the second half, Mai Lings came on strong, scoring continuously and immediately tying the score at 27 each. The scores went up and down, making the game extremely tense. Fortunately, Xinyun and Guozheng made consecutive shots, and Ren Yu saw the opportunity to raise their heads again. Mai Lings chased hard, and the score was 38-36, 42-40, only two points behind. At this time, both sides were eager to win, and Mai Lings focused on attacking, which greatly relaxed their defense, leaving many loopholes. Ren Yu's balls entered the net one after another. Mai Lings' situation was over, and they could not recover. The final score was 52-46, and Ren Yu defeated Mai Lings again.

### "Airbag" Chen Zhennan Invited to Swim in the Philippines: Departs Today to Participate in the 400m and 1500m Events

[Report from Our Newspaper in Hong Kong, 1st] Water hero Chen Zhennan recently received a letter from the Philippine swimming community, inviting him to compete in the Philippines. In addition to Chen Zhennan, Liang Aimei, S. Anderson, and H. Anderson were also invited, but the above three were unable to accept the invitation due to circumstances. Only Chen Zhennan departed on the 2nd. The Hong Kong Chinese swimming community held a grand banquet for him on the evening of the 28th, wishing him success.

[Hong Kong Aviation News, 28th] Chen Zhennan, a long-distance swimming star known as the "Airbag" and the "treasure of the Lijing Swimming Team," has been specially invited by the Philippine Sports Federation to participate in the All-Philippine Open Swimming Competition held on the 5th and 6th of next month. This is an open international competition, and water monsters from any country or region can sign up to participate and show their skills. However, according to regulations, each athlete is responsible for their own travel expenses. Chen Zhennan is an exception, and all expenses for meals, accommodation, and round-trip air tickets are covered by the Philippines.

Japan was originally the "Swimming Kingdom" of the Far East, with results comparable to those of top American players. However, due to the non-signing of the treaty, Japan's qualifications in the international sports arena have not yet been restored, and the Philippines did not invite them to participate in this competition. Although the Japanese youth Furuhashi has repeatedly broken the world records for 400m and 1500m.

It is said that Mr. Kimba, the secretary-general of the World Swimming Association, a key figure, has been trying to restore the qualifications of the Japanese swimming community for international competitions and plans to invite Furuhashi to perform in the United States. However, this is just a personal plan of Kimba, and he still needs to work hard to clear the way. It is too early to say at the moment. However, this secretary of the World Swimming Association confidently told a reporter from a Western newspaper in Australia: "Before the next World Games, Japan will definitely be able to restore its qualifications for international sports competitions."

Furthermore, Zhennan and his coach Huang Shaoxiong went to Victoria Club a few days ago by appointment and discussed the departure to the Philippines with the club secretary. Fatty Nan said to him: "Although I still swim regularly in the cold winter, the pool water is too cold, so the results are naturally not as good as during the swimming season. Moreover, this time I am going to a major competition overseas alone, and the coach cannot accompany me. I am afraid that I will fail and lose face for the Hong Kong and Philippine Chinese communities." He showed hesitation about this trip to the Philippines, without any confidence of victory.

After the encouragement of the Victoria Secretary and Coach Huang, Zhennan finally formally signed the contract to go to the Philippines and decided to depart on the Pan American plane on the 2nd of next month and participate in the competition on the 5th and 6th. The events have also been confirmed as 400m and 1500m. After the competition, he is scheduled to return to Hong Kong on the Pan American plane on the 8th. The entry procedures for going to the Philippines are quite troublesome. According to people in the Victoria Club, they have heard that Morse, the manager of the Shanghai Bank, has been helping Chen with this matter.

The competition will undoubtedly be held at the Philippine National Rizal Swimming Stadium. This is a 50-meter-long white porcelain swimming pool, which is different in length from Victoria and Chung Ching. Because all swimming competitions in Hong Kong are based on the "yard system" set by the British Swimming Association, while all swimming competitions in the Philippines are based on the "meter system" of the World Games swimming rules under the leadership of the Americans. Meters are longer than yards, so 1500 meters is also longer than 1600 yards. Chen Zhennan is known as the "Airbag."

### Philippine Athlete Maba is Fatty Nan's Strongest Rival

In the last Hong Kong-Philippine inter-city swimming competition, Chen competed with Philippine athlete Maba in the 880-yard race. Although Chen unfortunately finished as the runner-up by a narrow margin, his inexhaustible strength in the later stages surprised everyone. Therefore, this time when he goes to the Philippines, we don't have much expectation for Chen's 400 meters, but we would be satisfied if he can be nominated. However, in the 1500-meter event, I believe that he can defeat the Philippine "long-distance swimming king" Mr. Maba, and wash away the shame of losing by a narrow margin in the 880-yard race in Hong Kong.

However, the Philippines is a sea island with eternal spring, and the weather there seems to be more suitable for training water sports than Hong Kong. Maba may have made great progress in the past few months. However, as my brother Huang Shaoxiong said, "If Zhennan can maintain his best record of 21 minutes and 22.2 seconds in the 1500 meters, he can definitely win the championship in this international competition and make a name for himself overseas, bringing glory to the Hong Kong overseas Chinese."

It is found that "Fatty Nan" weighs 180 pounds and has won the cross-sea championship for three consecutive times. Last year, he won the championships in the 220, 440, and 883 open competitions in Hong Kong. He made many contributions in the Hong Kong-Philippine inter-city competition.

### Armored Forces Basketball Tournament Decides Champion Today

### China Industrial and Commercial College: Principal Change Dispute Resolved, Classes Start on the 4th

[Report from Our Newspaper] The dispute over the change of principal at China Industrial and Commercial College in this city has attracted attention from all parties in recent days due to the publication of announcements by Principal Shen Sizhuang and the school board Yang Weiyu in the newspapers, and professors and students have also been involved in the vortex. Some students paid fees and registered at the China Vocational Education Society, while others paid fees and registered at the original school, and the school has a tendency to split into two. The school board members could not bear to see the school they founded fall into this situation, so they mediated the dispute. Yesterday afternoon, the school board held a meeting at the China Vocational Education Society, discussing for more than three hours, and the dispute will be resolved soon.

It has now been decided that all students will start classes at the original site of Rongyuan on Yongjia Road from the 4th (Friday). Gu Shusen, the school board member and acting principal recommended by the school board, will go to the school today to discuss everything with Principal Shen Sizhuang.

### Malayan Chinese Continue to Participate in the All-England Badminton Championships: Believe that at Least Two of the Five Championships Can Be Won

[Report from Our Newspaper] London Broadcasting: According to observations by badminton professionals here, the All-England Badminton Championships this year will undergo major changes due to the participation of the Malayan Chinese team, which recently won the Thomas Cup in a winning streak. It is believed that at least two of the five championships will be won by Malayan Chinese. The importance of the All-England Badminton Championships can be compared with the Wimbledon Annual Tennis Championships. This year's competition will be held in Haringey.

The strength of the Malayan female players has not yet been speculated as they have not yet formally appeared. However, badminton observers here believe that if the technical level of the Malayan Chinese women is proportional to that of the men, then in mixed doubles, players from other countries will be difficult to avoid defeat and humiliation.

In men's singles, the "Sunday Express" nominated Huang Bingshun as the most outstanding player.

Based on their performance in defeating the United States and Danish teams in international competitions, the Malayan doubles teams have already secured the championship title.

This year's competition has an unprecedented number of participants, reaching 176. Players from the United States, Denmark, India, South Africa, Sweden, and other countries have all participated.

### Suggest that Badminton Should be Included as a Championship Event in the National Games

The Malayan Chinese badminton team won the first Thomas Cup overseas with excellent and outstanding performances. Although they represented British Malaya this time, all the team members from the leader to the reserve members were Chinese players. This should be an unprecedented honor for the sports community in our country.

Reuters sports editor Morgan said in a dispatch: "No one will deny that Malaya is a commendable world hegemon in the badminton world, which also gives some comfort to Sir Thomas, who donated the cup."

The Malayan Chinese team came from afar and spent a lot of money, but they finally succeeded, establishing an irrefutable honor - they are the best badminton players in the entire universe.

The Malayan Chinese team not only had amazing performances in their skills, but their sportsmanship on the court and their politeness off the court can be used as models. Anyone who donates to them should consider themselves satisfied - their money has not been wasted.

The overseas Chinese in Malaya should be proud of this group of badminton ambassadors. Their motto is: "We want to win, but we want to win with enough sportsmanlike demeanor. If we lose, we also want to lose beautifully. At the very least, we have done our best and strength."

I remember during the National Games, when these Malayan Chinese comets performed in the gymnasium, Li Guofan, the top badminton player in Shanghai, made a good analogy: "He (referring to Huang Bingshun) paced on the court, while the opponent was running desperately there!"

Badminton was not invented by the Chinese, but the first Thomas Cup fell into the hands of the Chinese. This is not only an honor for the Chinese, but it also makes us realize that the Chinese have the talent to play badminton. We suggest that badminton should be officially included as an event in the National Games, and should no longer be a demonstration match.

Fortunately, badminton equipment is simple and the cost is cheap, which can be afforded by the general economic strength of the people of the country. - May all the badminton championships in the world come to us from now on. (Ai Lian)
