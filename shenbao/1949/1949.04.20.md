### Government to Continue Thorough Discussion Today; May Request a Few Days' Extension to Consult with the CCP on Proposed Amendments

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The government's response to the eight articles and twenty-four clauses proposed by the CCP was not fully concluded in the day-long important meeting held on the 19th. It was decided that the meeting would continue on the 20th for a final decision. At 9:00 AM on the 19th, Acting President Li and Premier He Yingqin convened the Peace Negotiation Guidance Committee at the Ministry of National Defense. In addition to a brief explanation by He, Huang Shaohong, the representative who returned from Peiping, was invited to report on the progress of the peace negotiations, and advisor Qu Wu provided supplementary explanations. The report included: (1) the individual exchange of views from the beginning of April 1st to the 12th, and the records of several meetings with Bao Zhedong; (2) the situation and detailed records of the two general meetings on the 13th and 15th; (3) the conditions proposed by the CCP and the process of discussion; (4) the contacts with third-party figures and the opinions of the third-party figures; (5) the attitude and practices of important figures of the CCP. Huang and Qu's reports were extremely detailed, lasting for more than three hours before adjourning. The meeting continued in the afternoon, during which He presented the CCP's twenty-four clauses for discussion. Ju Zheng, Zhu Jiahua, and Wu Tiecheng, who had returned from Xikou, reported on the conclusions reached in Xikou with President Chiang on the peace issue. The meeting adjourned late in the evening. The afternoon session involved clause-by-clause discussions, so any clauses deemed to require significant changes could be unified. Those of a major nature did not reach a conclusion. This reporter interviewed participants after the meeting, but they did not disclose any opinions. What is known is that the ordinary clauses of the twenty-four clauses are not non-negotiable. Although there may be disagreements in terms of timing and implementation, it is widely believed that after the amended proposal is presented to the CCP, it will not be dismissed without consideration. As for important issues such as the crossing of the Yangtze River, they still require thorough research. Therefore, the meeting will likely reconvene on the morning of the 20th. Those attending the meeting today were Li Zongren, He Yingqin, Yu Youren, Tong Guanxian, Zhang Cui, Ju Zheng, Zhu Jiahua, Wu Zhongxin, Xu Yongchang, Wu Tiecheng; those attending as observers were Huang Shaohong, Qu Wu, Huang Shaogu, Huang Yunchun, Bai Chongxi, Yan Xishan, and Liu Jianqun.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The government's response to the CCP may be telegraphed to Peiping by midnight on the 20th. In order to make the progress of the peace talks known to the people, it is currently considering issuing a statement simultaneously with its response to the CCP. Both of these matters will be finalized at the political affairs meeting to be held at 9:00 PM on the 20th. The Peace Negotiation Guidance Committee convened by Acting President Li on the 19th is a party internal decision-making body. The Executive Yuan is the responsible cabinet, and all decisions must be approved by the political affairs meeting. The Peace Negotiation Guidance Committee will reconvene on the morning of the 20th. In the afternoon, He Yingqin will attend the Legislative Yuan to report, so the Executive Yuan's routine meeting will be changed to 9:00 PM to reach a decision before the deadline and inform the CCP.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Ju Zheng, Wu Tiecheng, and Zhu Jiahua, who went to Xikou to request instructions on the peace negotiations, returned to Shanghai on the 18th. On the morning of the 19th, they flew to Nanjing at around 9:00 AM. After getting off the plane, they went to the Ministry of National Defense to attend the Peace Negotiation Guidance Committee meeting convened by Acting President Li.

### Premier He to Visit the Legislative Yuan Today to Give a Comprehensive Report on Peace Negotiations, Including the CCP's Demands and the Government's Countermeasures

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Legislators requested to understand the progress of the peace negotiations and the content of the draft peace agreement. Wu Yanhuan and 47 others proposed a temporary motion at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 19th. At the same time, Premier He Yingqin also decided to attend the Legislative Yuan's special meeting on the afternoon of the 20th to give a comprehensive report on the progress of the peace negotiations, the CCP's demands, and the government's determined countermeasures. Wu Yanhuan's motion was to request the Executive Yuan to submit the peace terms to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation before the peace agreement is signed. The legislators spoke one after another, and most believed that before understanding the progress of the peace negotiations and the CCP's demands, the Premier of the Executive Yuan should be asked to report first. Moreover, the Legislative Yuan has already authorized the government to conduct peace negotiations. If this case is carried out before the peace negotiations are finalized, there is an obvious contradiction in the procedure. However, some legislators did not oppose the deliberation. There was no objection to inviting Premier He to report and inviting committee member Shao Hong to attend to exchange views. In the end, it was decided to ask Premier He to attend the Legislative Yuan to report before making a decision.

### Tong Guanxian and Liu Jianqun Invite All Legislators to a Banquet to Report on the Progress of the Peace Negotiation Guidance Committee

Tong arrived late at 1:00 PM due to attending the Peace Negotiation Guidance Committee meeting. He briefly reported on the progress of the peace negotiations and the situation of the meeting on the morning of the 19th, and said: "There has been no meeting for discussion. The 19th was the first formal consultation. The report that Acting President Li has telegraphed the CCP requesting a postponement is not accurate." He concluded: "The Legislative Yuan should support the government in the location of the government. No matter how it evolves in the future, the five branches of the government will act together." The banquet ended at 2:00 PM.

### Huang Xuchu Returns to Guangxi; Li Pinsian Arrives in Hankou from Nanjing

Mrs. Huang Yunchun, Director of the Second Bureau of the Presidential Palace, and Mrs. Cheng Siyuan, wife of a legislator, also returned to Guangxi on the same plane. It is also learned that Mrs. Guo Dejie, wife of Acting President Li, will also return to Guangxi from Nanjing within a few days.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 19th] Li Pinsian arrived in Hankou by plane from Nanjing at noon on the 19th. It is said that the future of the peace negotiations has not yet reached a state of hopelessness.

### Relatives of Important Officials in Nanjing Are Departing

[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Nanjing is outwardly stable today, and there is no chaos due to the approaching CCP deadline. All industries are proceeding as usual, which is very different from the situation three months ago when the communist army first arrived on the north bank of the Yangtze River. However, those who have the means to leave Nanjing have already departed. The families of some advisors to Acting President Li also left Nanjing today. However, train transportation is normal, and there are no extra flights. Rumors that the government has begun to move to Shanghai cannot be confirmed.

### Yu Youren Stated Yesterday That There is No Need to Go to Peiping

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] After his trip to Peiping was postponed again, Yu Youren told reporters on the evening of the 19th that he no longer needed to go to Peiping.

### Difficulties in Peace Negotiations Expected; Even if the Deadline is Reached, They Will Not Immediately Break Down

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The 20th is the date set by the Communist side for the government to sign the peace agreement. The government's attitude must be decided by midnight on the 20th at the latest, so that the government delegation in Peiping can be notified as soon as possible to convey it to the CCP. Authoritative sources revealed on the evening of the 19th that the government has decided on the following two points: First, before noon on the 20th, the government will telegraph its representatives to inform the CCP, explaining the various practical difficulties, and request an extension of the signing date (possibly extending it by five days to sign on the 25th). Second, during the extended period, the government will propose amendments to facilitate consultations with the CCP. The source also stated that the signing of the peace agreement is of great importance, and the government must thoroughly discuss and unify the opinions of all parties within the party, so that this peace agreement can have integrity. The government's opinion on the most difficult part of the CCP's terms is that everything should be decided by the coalition government after it is established. The proportion of each party in the coalition government should be clearly stipulated, and the Kuomintang should have its due position. As for issues such as the crossing of the Yangtze River and the reorganization of the army, they can be left to the coalition government to find a solution, and there is no need to raise them during this period when the fighting has not stopped, so as to avoid complications. If the government's amendments can be considered and adopted by the CCP, then the future of the peace negotiations will be promising.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] An authoritative observer said on the evening of the 19th: "Although the 20th is the deadline set by the CCP for signing the peace agreement, it does not mean that if the agreement cannot be signed, the communist army will cross the Yangtze River." The observer believes that whether the communist army crosses the Yangtze River depends on its strength. If the peace negotiations have not completely ended and the communist army crosses the Yangtze River, the government army will resist. Whether the communist army can achieve its goals at that time is still a question. Now that the 20th has arrived, the signing of the peace agreement will be postponed. Regardless of whether the government requests a postponement or whether China agrees, the communist army will not cross the Yangtze River on the 21st if the agreement is not signed by the 20th. Moreover, when the peace negotiations began, it was foreseen that there would be many difficulties. There will inevitably be some twists and turns during the peace negotiations. Success is not easy, and it will not break down with the first setback.

### Huang Shaohong's Sentiments

Wrote "Good Things Approaching" in Peiping

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Huang Shaohong, the government's peace negotiation representative, wrote two poems to express his sentiments in Peiping. The original poems are as follows:

"Good Things Approaching"

First

"Looking up at the long sky, people are settled, light smoke envelops the blue, waiting for a new moon to be full, wanting to ask when it will be round. Last night I took a nap and dreamed of Jiangnan, wild fire burned the Cold Food Festival. Fortunately, a sail sent wind, reporting news from Yan and Yun."

Second

"The north country is blooming, and the flowers in Jiangnan have fallen, only the red apricot by the wall remains, lonely and melancholy in the guest's quarters. At this time, for this enemy, I have given up my spring tour appointment, but I urge the god of spring to be careful, and not let it drift away."

### Non-Combatants in Wuhan Ordered to Evacuate Southward

### Draft Organizational Law of the Ministry of Economic Affairs Amended and Passed by the Legislative Yuan; Name of Affiliated Resources Committee Decided to Remain Unchanged; Re-Examination of the Proposal to Improve the Treatment of Public School Teachers and Civil Servants

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The 16th meeting of the Third Session of the Legislative Yuan was held at 9:30 AM on the 19th. Tong Guanxian participated in the eleven-member committee and amended and passed the draft organizational law of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Article 8 of the original draft, "The Ministry of Economic Affairs may add, merge, or abolish various departments and affiliated agencies with the resolution of the Executive Yuan Council and the Legislative Yuan," was deleted by resolution, so the organization of the Ministry of Economic Affairs no longer has room for flexibility. In addition, at the request of Minister Sun Yueqi, after repeated discussions, it was decided to rename the Resources Bureau attached to the Ministry of Economic Affairs as the Resources Committee to avoid modifying the names on domestic and foreign contracts. At the same time, it also saves the waste of changing signboards, seals, and public funds paper due to the name change. In addition, all were passed without objection. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.

The meeting continued at 4:00 PM. Liu Jianqun was also unable to attend due to official business. Zou Shuwen was elected as the chairman to discuss: (1) The proposal to quickly and reasonably adjust the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants nationwide was resolved to be re-examined and submitted for discussion at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 22nd. (2) The proposal by Zhou Shusheng and others to abolish military agencies, strictly prohibit vacant military positions, establish a military expenditure budget, and increase the treatment of soldiers was resolved to be jointly reviewed by the National Defense Committee, the Budget Committee, and the Finance and Banking Committee. (3) The proposal by Zhou Shusheng to establish special articles to sanction market monopolies in order to avoid unreasonable price fluctuations and ensure people's livelihood was resolved to be jointly reviewed by the Economic and Resources Committee, the Civil Law Committee, the Commercial Law Committee, and the Criminal Law Committee. (4) The proposal by Rong Zhao and others to request the government to protect industries throughout the country, not to damage them due to war, to maintain national vitality, and to benefit production was resolved to be jointly reviewed by the National Defense Committee and the Economic and Resources Committee. (5) The Finance and Banking Committee and the Civil Law Committee reported on the joint review of the proposal by Kong Geng and others to request the re-revision of the standards for clearing bank deposits and housing loans before the war to show fairness and convince people. It was resolved that due to lack of time, it would be left for discussion at the next Legislative Yuan meeting. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The Legislative Yuan's Procedure Committee met at 6:00 PM on the evening of the 19th and decided on the agenda for the 17th Legislative Yuan meeting. In addition to the cases that were not discussed at the 16th meeting, the following reporting items were added: (1) The Executive Yuan's request to review the draft organizational regulations of the Hainan Special Administrative Region Chief Executive Office. (2) The Executive Yuan's request to review the abolition of the Tungsten and Antimony Purchase Regulations. Discussion items: (1) Review of the amendment to the organizational law of the Examination Yuan, abolishing the Ministry of Examinations, with its business directly handled by the Examination Yuan, and shrinking the Ministry of Personnel into the Bureau of Personnel to simplify and save public funds. (2) Review of the draft provincial and county autonomy general rules and the Executive Yuan's draft legislative principles for provincial and county autonomy general rules.

### Peiping Peace Talks Temporarily Adjourned; Government Representatives Awaiting Instructions

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] After the CCP announced the eight articles and twenty-four clauses and stipulated the 20th as the signing date, the peace talks in Peiping have obviously been temporarily adjourned. According to related sources, the government's peace negotiation delegation is currently awaiting instructions from the government to continue further consultations with the CCP representatives. In recent days, they have only been in private contact with the CCP and third-party figures. According to relevant sources, the government delegation encountered many difficulties after contacting the CCP representatives at the beginning of their arrival in Peiping. Later, after Zhang Zhizhong and all the representatives met with Bao Zhedong one after another, the situation gradually improved. The eight articles and twenty-four clauses proposed by the CCP represent only a very small part of their opinions, but the main ones are all CCP demands. The full text was proposed by the CCP representatives at a formal meeting, stating that the draft has been adopted by the government and third-party figures. In addition, it is difficult to make any further concessions. At the same time, the deadline of the 20th was announced, hoping that the government would express its attitude before the 20th so that it could be signed on the 20th. Huang Shaohong's delay in returning to Nanjing for three days was due to the CCP proposing the eight articles and twenty-four clauses. After the second formal meeting at midnight on the 15th, the government representatives decided that because the deadline was approaching, they decided to ask Huang Shaohong and Qu Wu to take the entire plan back to Nanjing on the morning of the 16th to request instructions.

### Communist Army Fiercely Bombards Taiyuan City; 1,200 Shells Land in the City; Eastern Battlefield Only a Li Away from the City

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] In the past 24 hours, in addition to fiercely besieging Taiyuan City with a crowd of more than 100,000, the communist army also launched all its artillery and bombarded the Kuomintang army positions inside and outside the city. According to a preliminary report obtained by the military here at 8:00 PM on the 19th through a wireless phone call with Taiyuan, more than 1,200 shells landed in the city, and more than 5,000 shells landed near the Taiyuan Pacification Office and the Drum Tower. Residents relied on bomb shelters, so although there were casualties, the damage to residential houses was incalculable. The only airport in the west of the city that could still land yesterday is now becoming increasingly difficult to use due to the approaching front line and the fierce anti-aircraft fire of the communist army.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The battle to defend Taiyuan has entered its fifth day, and the war is gradually entering its climax. The two armies of Nie Rongzhen and Xu Xiangqian, totaling 20 armies, plus an artillery division, launched a full-scale attack on the four suburbs of the city from the night of the 18th. In the eastern direction, after a night of fighting, the battlefield has shifted from Sanjian Tree to the Machang and Wohushan areas, which are only a li away from the city. In the northern direction, due to the higher terrain, fighting continued on the line about three or four li away from the city on the 19th. In the southern and southeastern directions, the battle line had shifted to the Qinxiandian, Yangjiabao, 123 Barracks, Black Camel Village, and Zhaobi Tomb, which are more than ten li away from the city, by 6:00 PM on the 19th. In the western direction, the fighting was fierce in Nantun, about ten li away from the city, on the morning of the 19th.

More than 200 shells had landed by noon, causing heavy casualties and losses to merchants and residents. In addition to declaring that their property has suffered serious destruction, their feelings are extremely indignant. The Shanxi Provincial Assembly and other mass organizations believe that the communist army's actions during the peace negotiations are inappropriate and have sent a telegram to Acting President Li to request that effective measures be taken.

### Heavy War Situation on the North Bank of the Yangtze River: Communist Forces Fiercely Attack Beishazhou of Shierwei; First Attempt to Cross the River Fails

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] Communist forces along the entire northern bank of the Yangtze River focused their attacks on Shierwei southwest of Yangzhou and Beishazhou east of Yangzhong County on the 19th. In the Shierwei area, Chen Yi's troops, initially with one division of the 34th Army, launched an attack starting on the night of the 17th. By the evening of the 18th, the force had increased to an entire army, leading to an increasingly grave war situation by the evening of the 19th. On the Beishazhou front, parts of the 20th and 23rd Armies of the Communist forces, after occupying Nanyongan Island at the port on the morning of the 18th, continued their advance towards Beishazhou to the south that evening. By 6 p.m. on the 19th, fierce fighting was still ongoing. Additionally, the Communist forces on Yongan Island, while attacking Beishazhou, also coordinated with Communist forces at the port to launch artillery attacks on Yangzhong.

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 19th] The 34th Army of Chen Yi's Communist forces in Yizheng is actively gathering earth to surround the three strongholds of Guazhou, Liuzhou, and Shierwei. Starting at 1 a.m. on the evening of the 18th, over 20,000 Communist troops launched a fierce attack on Shiye Island between Shierwei and Guazhou. This area is strategically located, facing the Yangtze River with a narrow river surface. Fan Xiyuan, leading the security regiment of Yizheng County, along with the National Army, bravely resisted, and the navy stationed on the river also provided intense artillery support. There were over nine rounds of contention in this area, and the battle situation was extremely fierce. Residents of the provincial capital were awakened by the sound of cannons and machine guns. The fighting continued until dawn on the 19th. Shiye Island is currently being steadfastly defended by the defending troops. Furthermore, around 1 a.m. on the morning of the 19th, over 10,000 Communist troops from Dongxincheng in Yizheng attempted to capture the bridgehead of Shierwei in one fell swoop, but were suppressed and forced to retreat after the defending troops coordinated with the navy to launch artillery bombardment. In addition, a large number of Communist vessels have been concentrated near Sanjiangying. The National Army is currently closely watching the next move of the Communist forces. There have been constant small-scale encounters in the Guazhou and Liuzhou areas.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] The situation on the Guazhou side across from Zhenjiang has not calmed down, and fierce fighting is still taking place near Shierwei. Lisi Island (Shiye Island) in the river south of Shierwei is still being firmly defended by the National Army. Rumors that it has been attacked and landed on by Communist forces are inaccurate.

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 19th] After Communist forces seized Yongan Island, follow-up troops continued to land on the 19th, and approximately 6,000 troops have now arrived. Furthermore, according to a well-informed military source, the Communist forces facing Zhenjiang will not be able to threaten the southern bank but will only be able to carry out attempted crossings or artillery bombardment on the southern bank from the northeast and northwest.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 19th] Communist forces in Xinzhou, Gaoqiao, and Sanjiangying on the north bank of Zhenjiang attempted to cross the river on the evening of the 18th but were repelled by our troops. The fighting ceased at 3 a.m. on the 19th. In addition, the artillery battle at Siyuangou west of Guazhou ceased on the morning of the 19th but resumed at 1 p.m. on the 19th and has not stopped by the evening.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] Naval Intelligence: Communist forces attacking Shierwei launched a fierce attack on the National Army on the northeast and northwest flanks on the evening of the 18th. By 1 a.m. on the 19th, the battle situation was intense. After our navy launched a fierce attack from pre-arranged positions, a fierce artillery battle ensued between the two sides. By 3 a.m., the Communist forces, unable to withstand the pressure of our intense artillery fire, retreated. The battle situation then subsided. At 4 a.m., Communist reinforcements, along with three mountain guns, launched a fierce attack on the direct north of Shierwei, and fighting continued into the evening. Over a hundred Communist troops were discovered at the Shatou River estuary between Sanjiangying and Guazhou across from Zhenjiang. They were dispersed after naval artillery fire.

[Reuters Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] A shocking cable this morning stated that the Communist forces made their first large-scale attempt to cross the Yangtze River last night, 55 miles east of Nanjing. An entire division or more of Communist troops, at around 10 p.m. last night, divided into over 1,000 small boats from Lotus Island in the Yangtze River, 12 miles northeast of Zhenjiang, and began to attack the southern bank. At midnight, National Army gunboats and cannons on the southern bank opened fire fiercely on the attacking Communist forces. The Communist forces have not been able to gain a foothold. Lotus Island was occupied by Communist forces 24 hours ago.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] Amid the tense atmosphere along the entire northern bank of the Yangtze River, the Liangpu area on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway also remained in a state of suspense. In order to strengthen the defense of the Yangtze River, the Capital Garrison Headquarters issued an order starting at 0:00 a.m. on the 19th to suspend all existing civilian ferries.

Editorial

### Can the United States Still Afford to Wait and See?

Amid the rising demands in the United States for increased aid to China, Secretary of State Acheson's letter to Congressman Connally has been released. This letter has dampened the spirits of those advocating for aid to China, but it has also provoked the indignation of senators, filling the Senate with condemnation and accusations. This has forced officials in the State Department to resort to self-deprecating explanations, such as "the rising tide of Asian nationalism will prevent the Soviet Union from controlling China" (Special Dispatch from Washington by various news agencies, 17th). Whether the United States should increase aid to China is, of course, a matter for the United States itself, and it is not appropriate for the recipient country to express an opinion. However, this issue is no longer a simple question of "right" or "wrong," but rather a question concerning the peace of the entire world. We cannot bear to see Secretary of State Acheson misled by erroneous intelligence, leading the United States astray and repeating historical mistakes in the Far East, in China. Therefore, we cannot help but write this article to correct this terrible misconception that exists between the United States and China.

Acheson's letter to Congressman Connally was issued on March 15th. Because of its significant implications, its release could weaken the Chinese government's position in peace talks, so it was not made public for some time. However, Senator Green, a Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, requested that the letter be released, and it was therefore released to the public on April 16th. The contents of this letter explain the State Department's views on the McCarran $1.5 billion aid-to-China bill. The full text has been translated by the United States Information Service and published in various newspapers in Shanghai.

Summarizing the main points of the letter, we can identify the following: (1) Since the victory in the war, the United States has provided China with over $2 billion in aid; however, the economic and military situation of the Chinese government has still deteriorated to such an extent that it is unable to resist the continued southward advance of the Chinese Communists in South China. (2) The failure of the Chinese government's troops is not due to a lack of ammunition and equipment; even if the United States provides further military aid, it will not be able to change the current state of affairs in China. (3) If the United States continues to aid China, it will only prolong the Chinese civil war, increase the suffering of the Chinese people, and ultimately deepen anti-American sentiment among the Chinese people. (4) If the United States wants to reverse the current deterioration of the Chinese government's situation, it would need to deploy a large number of armed forces for actual combat, which would violate the United States' traditional policy toward China and its own national interests. Therefore, Acheson concludes, "The State Department believes that the aid to China proposed in this bill, regardless of its scope or nature, cannot be guaranteed by the current environment in China." However, fearing that this overly passive policy toward China would provoke public discontent, Acheson opened a small "door of convenience" at the end of his conclusion. He said, "The government has considered requesting Congress to extend the term of the 1948 China Aid Act, so that the remaining unpaid funds (approximately $54 million) can be allocated for a certain period of time after the act expires on April 2, 1949. If the situation in China can be clarified during this period, further suggestions may be made." This letter fully exposes the contradictions in the US policy toward China. Acheson still adopts a wait-and-see attitude toward the situation in China, on the one hand being misled by erroneous information, believing that continued aid to China would not be helpful and would only deepen anti-American sentiment among the Chinese people; on the other hand, he is afraid of public criticism and still keeps the "door of aid to China" open. This indecisive, hesitant, and procrastinating attitude will undoubtedly cause endless sighs among the Chinese people, and even the American people will express deep disgust. Therefore, the Senate is filled with voices of opposition to Acheson. Republican Senator Bridges demanded that Congress investigate the State Department's policy toward China; the original proponent of the bill, McCarran, accused Acheson of providing Congress with erroneous and false information and showing weakness to the Chinese Communists. The New York Times believes that the government cannot hesitate on the China issue. Although Acheson did not respond directly, his aides have defended him, saying, "Even if the Chinese Communists achieve complete victory in the civil war, Asian nationalism will still prevent the Soviet Union from controlling China. Therefore, once the civil war is over, China will inevitably exclude all foreign forces. The government's policy of 'hands-off' toward China is for this reason." This self-justifying and self-deprecating statement only reveals its far-fetched arguments. We only need to raise the following two questions, and Acheson will be unable to answer them.

First, the postwar US foreign policy has been based on the "Truman Doctrine" and the "Marshall Plan." In a nutshell, it is based on the four words "anti-communism and anti-Soviet Union." In the past, in the hope of compromising with the Soviet Union and jointly building peace, it did not even care about making blatant expressions. But today, the Atlantic Pact has been signed, and the encirclement of the Soviet Union has been formed. Even President Truman warned all countries that the United States would not hesitate to use atomic bombs for world peace. The United States is so anti-communist and anti-Soviet in Europe, but in the Far East, Acheson takes a different view of the Chinese government, which is the most anti-communist, and adopts a wait-and-see attitude. How will Acheson justify this? Stetson said, "The failure to implement the Marshall Plan in Asia is our most tragic failure." What does Acheson think about this?

Second, there are many people in the United States who have many illusions about China, believing that China has no international character and is just a political party advocating land reform. Some even think that Mao Zedong can be China's Tito, not subject to Moscow's control. There was reason to hold this illusion in the past, but today, it is nothing but a blind diplomat who still uses this to justify and mock himself. Haven't you seen Mao Zedong's telegram opposing the Atlantic Pact yet? Haven't you heard that one of Mao Zedong's eight conditions is to abolish all traitorous treaties (the Sino-US Trade Treaty, the Sino-US Mutual Agreement, the Sino-US Relief Agreement, and the 1947 Sino-US Agreement)? Conducting diplomacy without being realistic is like a blind man riding a blind horse, and won't it cause a catastrophe!

In short, the situation in China is about to take a turn for the worse, and the threat of communist forces in the Far East is becoming more serious. Can the United States still afford to wait and see? Former Secretary of State Marshall has admitted his mistakes and resigned. How can Secretary of State Acheson repeat the same mistakes? Communist forces are now developing towards the world's "vacuum zone" - Asia. The success of the Chinese Communists is the beginning of communist forces controlling the entire Asia. How can Acheson blindly evade reality and still adopt a "wait-and-see" attitude? The accusations of the Senate are not enough to worry about, but the criticism of historians is cruel and cannot be ignored.

### Continued Operation of Gold Trading Regulations Approved by Hong Kong Financial Authorities; General Expectation that Black Market Will Still Exist

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 19th] The Gold and Silver Exchange's regulations for the continued operation of gold trading were approved by the financial authorities this morning. They will be implemented after being discussed and passed by the Exchange's members' meeting tonight. It is understood that the principles stipulated in the regulations allow Exchange members to continue trading an appropriate amount of industrial gold (95 gold) to supply jewelers and dentists. The Gold and Silver Exchange will no longer engage in speculative gold trading in the future. However, it is generally expected that the black market will still exist. For example, the Exchange has stopped reporting telegraphic transactions to Guangzhou, but there are still so-called "outside market" transactions.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 19th] Although there are no official gold prices, black market trading is quite active. Today is the second day of resumption of business for the jewelry industry. Both buyers and sellers conduct semi-public transactions through jewelry stores. The buying price is HK$330 per tael, and the selling price is HK$345 per tael.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 19th] Regarding the Hong Kong government's ban on buying and selling and private storage of gold, a Hong Kong government spokesman made further supplementary explanations this morning, stating that the ordinance only targets future gold trading and does not affect the existing gold holdings of Hong Kong merchants and residents. From a legal point of view, those currently holding gold cannot sell it, and the government has no intention of acquiring gold from the public. The rumors circulating in the market that the government intends to freeze gold stored in bank safety deposit boxes are unfounded. Regarding the banks or legal entities authorized to engage in gold trading, the government will announce them publicly. According to financial circles, although the government has no intention of acquiring gold stored by the public, the public's gold holdings are legally frozen before authorized banks begin buying and selling gold. However, black market sales are expected to flourish, and the public's gold holdings will be smuggled out, shifting Hong Kong's gold market, which has long been the most active in the Far East, to Macau.

[Finally News Agency, Hong Kong, 19th] According to Deputy Financial Secretary Yandell's explanation to the chairman of the Jewelry Industry Association this morning, the gold ordinance only regulates pure gold and 95% gold, while 22-karat gold, i.e., anything below 22 karats, can still be freely bought and sold. Regarding the management of jewelry sales, jewelry stores must register the names and addresses of buyers for authorities to check at any time. Each buyer is limited to buying three taels per day. All existing jewelry stocks in jewelry stores must be reported to the authorities within the shortest possible time.

### The West Insists on Lifting the Berlin Blockade; Door Open for Four-Power Negotiations; Plan to Establish West German Government Not Abandoned; Soviet Envoy's Mission to the US Confirmed

[United Press, London, 19th] Diplomatic circles said on the 19th that the West has rejected the Soviet Union's tentative proposal to end the Berlin blockade but has kept the door open for further negotiations. Sources said that the Soviet representatives have been solemnly informed that the West can accept: (1) simultaneous termination of the Soviet blockade of Berlin and the Allied opposition; (2) a Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference after the blockade is lifted to discuss the entire German question. However, it is claimed that the West will indicate that the plan to establish a West German government will continue regardless of Soviet opposition. Negotiations between East and West on the Berlin issue are reportedly being conducted through the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik. It is reported that Malik initially suggested that the West suspend its plan to establish a West German government in exchange for lifting the blockade. Malik implied that this would lead to a Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the German question. Diplomatic circles here said that this proposal was submitted to the Western Big Three Foreign Ministers - Acheson, Bevin, and Schuman - who were meeting in Washington at the time. They apparently decided that they could not accept any suggestion that would make them abandon the West German plan, but they were willing to reconvene. The reply was given to Malik, and was as informal as when Malik initially raised the suggestion. Diplomatic circles also said that the next action now needs to be decided by the Soviet Union.

[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] Reliable German sources close to the Soviet military headquarters report that a Soviet official left Berlin for Washington yesterday on a secret mission to the Soviet Embassy there. It is said that the person will also obtain detailed information on the Atlantic Pact in the United States, and its consequences for Western Europe, especially West Germany. The envoy is accompanied by another Soviet person. Although his name has not been announced, it is believed that he is General Malinin, a financial expert and confidant of the Communist Party Politburo. Malinin was Sokolovsky's financial advisor when he implemented the Berlin blockade. However, Malinin's main topic of discussion is not the Berlin blockade. People in the Soviet military government are reluctant to reveal whether the envoy will be received by US Secretary of State Acheson. It is understood that before leaving Berlin, Malinin had detailed talks with General Chuikov, the Soviet military governor in Germany, and his political advisor, Semionov. It is also learned that Dikanokov, another Soviet expert on German issues and the last Soviet ambassador to Germany before the war, was also in Berlin during Easter. Malinin often accompanied former Soviet military governor Sokolovsky to Allied Control Council meetings. Malinin has many aliases, one of which is Georgiev.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] Diplomatic circles say the few remaining trade relations between East and West German ports may become a path for the Soviet Union to propose an end to the Berlin blockade. If the Soviet Union can conduct one or two trial shipments successfully through the anti-blockade line, the result may be a gradual relaxation of restrictions on both sides without any "formal" agreement. The huge cost of the airlift to the United States so far will make Congress and taxpayers happy to end it, but rather than let Berlin fall completely into Soviet hands, the airlift will continue.

### Second Day of US Military Exercises; Air Force Regains Air Superiority by Defeating a Larger Force

[United Press, Nuremberg, 19th] In the largest exercise in Germany since the war, two advancing units of the simulated enemy army invaded Germany from the Czech border on the 19th. "Enemy aircraft passed through the American defense" and "attacked two important occupied headquarters." The US Air Force was ordered to retake air superiority in Germany. About 100 American aircraft took off. The enemy aircraft was able to control the airspace based on the assumption that the number of aircraft was three times that of the American aircraft, but the American aircraft fought hard from the supply line 300 miles from the Atlantic coast to the front line 95 miles from the Czech border. "The enemy" continued to cause unrest in the American rear during the day, "damaging" important railway equipment in Mannheim. Communication was cut off this morning when "enemy aircraft" attacked. Ten officers and a repair team tried their best to repair it, intending to restore communication as soon as possible.

### Stettinius Re-emphasizes the "MacArthur Plan" Urging the US to Broadly Aid Asia, Allocating $1 Billion to Support South China and the Entire Asian Continent

[Associated Press, Philadelphia, 18th] The last Republican presidential candidate, Stettinius, the history professor at the University of Pennsylvania, sent a letter to the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin today, re-emphasizing the proposal to formulate a "MacArthur Aid Asia Plan" to go hand-in-hand with the Marshall European Aid Plan. Stettinius declared that many people misunderstood his speech delivered in Boston on the first of this month, and it is necessary to supplement and clarify it. He is not asking for aid to China alone, but for aid to Asia as a whole.

The US government's actions in Asia after the war violated the judgments and advice of most fair scholars around the world. Although the European Recovery Plan formulated by former Secretary of State Marshall was the most important achievement after the war, the failure to implement the same basic method for Asia was our most tragic failure. Asia is different from Europe and cannot be treated as a direct object, so he suggested borrowing the name of a great hero and calling it the "MacArthur Plan" to symbolize that the United States will expand further assistance to many peoples and lands in a vast part of the world. According to the plan, the United States should allocate $1 billion annually to support South China and the entire Asia, in order to prevent communism. This measure is necessary to counteract aid that is conducive to the Communist Party's rule in China. The US State Department must take action immediately to support South China. The new plan is not only to aid Japan, China, or Myanmar, but is a pan-Asian nature. The aid methods include improving transportation in China and Myanmar, developing inland river hydropower projects in India, and promoting the revival of the Philippines and Japan. In addition, the trade methods between Asian countries should be stipulated. The United States currently has "no policy and plan" for Asia, and the government should formulate this plan as soon as possible and hand it over to those who are familiar with the Asian situation.

Mr. Mondale said that the United States is building higher, wider, and more expensive embankments on one side of the river in an attempt to contain the tide of communism, while on the other side, allowing the red flood to flood the blue Asian plains is the most harmful and frustrating thing.

### Second Economic Conference; Silver Dollar Problem Becomes the Focus of Discussion; Four Resolutions Passed, Meeting Continues Today

[Report from this newspaper] The second economic conference of this city was held at 3:00 p.m. yesterday in the City Hall Conference Room, presided over by Secretary-General Chen Liang. The attendees included Minister of Finance Liu Kung-yun, Commander of the Garrison of Jinghu-Hangzhou Tang Enbo, Garrison Commander Chen Daqing, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs Cao Peizi, Fang Zhi of the City Party Headquarters, Deputy Speaker of the City Council Xu Qiwei, Zhou Xuexiang of the General Labor Union, Bi Delin of the Economic Control Bureau, Pan Shihao and Ouyang Lun of the Industrial Association, Tian Heqing, and Wang Xiaolai, and more than 40 representatives from relevant agencies. The discussions on the shortage of banknotes, the use of promissory notes, the buying and selling of silver dollars, and the use of silver dollars as the unit of pricing for wages and commodities were very heated. The conference adjourned at 6:30 p.m., and the following resolutions were passed: (1) Regarding the solution of the banknote shortage and the use of promissory notes on the same day, the Central Bank and the Gold Control Bureau are requested to consult on detailed measures before the end of this month and notify relevant agencies for their reference. (2) Whether silver dollars can be used as currency and whether silver dollars should be used as the standard for prices and wages should be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review. (3) Regarding the management of silver dollar transactions: A. Banks, pawnshops, commercial firms, and post offices licensed by the government may buy and sell silver dollars, but they must first register and obtain a license. B. Mobile vendors should be concentrated in designated areas for management, and detailed measures should be formulated by the municipal government's competent authorities in consultation with the Central Bank and the Gold Control Bureau. C. Whether pawn shops should be allowed to resume business should be considered and decided by the Ministry of Finance. (4) Due to time constraints, the issue of wages being denominated in silver dollars will be discussed again at 2:00 p.m. today in the City Hall Conference Room by the relevant agencies.

### Minister of Finance Liu Kung-yun Attends to Report on the Contents of the New Financial Reform Plan

Before the economic conference was held yesterday, Secretary-General Chen first invited Minister of Finance Liu Kung-yun to report on the contents of the new financial and financial reform plan that had been revised and passed by the central government. He briefly stated: The financial and financial reform plan has been revised according to President He's administrative guidelines and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for revision and approval. The more important contents are: (1) The original provision that customs yuan must be purchased from the Central Bank with gold and foreign exchange has been changed to allow purchase with gold yuan notes. (2) Commodity tax will still not be collected in kind. (3) The system of collecting salt tax in kind will be postponed. (4) Direct tax and profit tax will adopt a distribution system. (5) Property tax will be implemented. (6) Commodity tax will still not be calculated by quantity, and fines for overdue payments will be based on the principle of preserving value. The Central Bank will formulate separate measures. (7) Maintain foreign exchange settlement convenience for industry and commerce as much as possible, and implement fixed-order loans and value-preserving deposits. (8) Implement value-preserving deposits and value-preserving insurance. (9) In terms of trade, imports will be restricted. The Ministry of Finance is considering the issue of tax exemption for gold and silver imports proposed by the Legislative Yuan. Value-preserving deposits are being actively prepared, and value-preserving insurance will be formulated after consultation with the insurance industry. The customs system is currently being drafted overnight by the Direct Tax Bureau and other agencies for implementation and public announcement.

Mr. Liu analyzed the city's soaring prices, stating: The government's implementation of silver dollar payments has led to a sudden increase in government expenditures, which has affected price increases. However, I dare to guarantee that the entire economy will not collapse, because the government has not yet used its strength and still has sufficient power to respond. We should implement the new financial and financial reform plan with great confidence. Anyone who disrupts finance will be severely punished. We hope that all sectors will help us overcome this difficult situation together.

### Commander-in-Chief Tang's Three Points

After Minister Liu finished speaking, Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo expressed several points: (1) The new financial and financial plan was revised and formulated based on actual needs. It is hoped that all sectors will unanimously support it and jointly solve the current economic difficulties. The Central Bank's sale of gold, silver, and foreign currency cannot solve the problem. Emphasis should be placed on encouraging production, making the transportation of goods smooth, so that industry and commerce can be maintained, and a large amount of daily necessities should be purchased and stored. (2) The lives of workers should be effectively guaranteed. (3) At present, rural residents use rice as the unit of transaction. It seems that the city can also use in-kind or silver dollars as the unit of pricing, which can help stabilize finance.

### Banknote Shortage Will Not Happen Again

Minister Liu's answers to the issues raised by the General Labor Union and the Industrial Association regarding the use of silver dollars as currency, silver dollar transactions, banknote shortage, and the use of promissory notes are as follows: (1) Silver dollars cannot be used as currency, but they are allowed to be freely traded, because the circulation of silver dollars and gold yuan at the same time would have too much impact on the gold yuan. Moreover, after the military's non-staple food expenses are changed to silver dollars, they must be allowed to be freely traded. As for whether the silver standard will be adopted in the future, the Ministry of Finance is currently considering the government's strength and will wait for the opportunity to make a decision. (2) Silver dollar transactions can be listed by the Central Bank every day. What needs to be considered now is also the issue of strength, because the government does not have enough silver dollars. (3) The formation of the banknote shortage is due to the Central Bank's inability to print large banknotes in time, resulting in a disconnect. Now, after printing day and night, it is guaranteed that this situation will not happen again in the future. (4) Whether promissory notes can be used on the same day is a technical issue, and it will definitely be improved after research.

### Garrison Headquarters Proposes 12 Recommendations

In addition, the twelve recommendations on economic measures proposed by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters were resolved yesterday to be distributed to the competent authorities for review. The original text is recorded as follows:

In order to fundamentally achieve a balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure, reduce issuance, or a sound monetary system, and increase production and smooth the flow of goods, in a wartime economy, it is almost impossible. Here, nine people make recommendations for adverse causes and industries and what should be improved and what can be done as follows: (1) Reduce speculative firms - there are too many firms in Shanghai, too little capital. Except for their signs and facades, there is almost no capital to speak of, and all are credit speculation. The amount of silver dollars in each firm's pre-war capital should be converted into gold yuan notes, and the existing capital and the percentage of its reserve funds should be checked. Those who are short in the above two items should have their licenses revoked or merged. (3) Implement silver dollar value-preserving deposits and loans - the former requires no fixed deposit period, fair calculation, and convenient remittance and allocation, which can be achieved. The latter can provide an outlet for the government's stored funds and prevent the national treasury from suffering losses. (3) Allow the use of silver dollars - on the one hand, salaries are paid in silver dollars, and on the other hand, they are not allowed to be used. Isn't this self-contradictory and intentionally creating silver dollar traffickers? The Central Bank should list prices every day and allow them to be converted into gold yuan notes for use. (4) Reduce credit expansion - except for the Central Bank, no one is allowed to issue promissory notes, and those who are far away should be closed down. (5) Reduce the currency circulation rate - while the Central Bank sells gold, it allows gold notes to be mortgaged, so a large amount of currency still falls into the hands of speculators and accelerates circulation. It should be absolutely forbidden to mortgage gold notes. (6) There are restrictions on industrial and commercial loans - based on purchase orders, payment for goods, and verification of goods. (The above six items should be strictly implemented by the Gold Control Bureau, the Central Bank, and the Ministry of Finance) (7) The price increase of public utilities should be limited - the subsidy policy should be reconsidered. (Please ask the Municipal Government to forward it to the relevant central authorities for prompt action) (8) The prices of important daily necessities should be subject to review. (9) Monitor the market, remove intercom telephones, and prohibit price gouging. (10) Crack down on the silver dollar market, express riders, and silver dollar peddlers. (10)(1) Inspect the business account books of firms and shops, and close down those that specialize in speculation outside of their business. (10)(2) Practice thrift - electricity, gasoline, banquets, etc. should all be economized. (The above five items should be strictly handled by the Municipal Government in conjunction with the relevant authorities) Today's problem requires recognizing the seriousness of the situation, preventing economic collapse, ensuring order, and stabilizing people's livelihood. It is impossible not to break through relationships and sacrifice the extra benefits of some people, and strictly handle it. I hope that some measures will be taken, which would be fortunate.

### Preparatory Committee for North-South Barter Joint Management Office to Be Established

[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Industrial Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Shipping Association recently held a symposium on the North-South barter issue. It was unanimously agreed that the government has, in principle, agreed to the North-South barter issue, and the industrial and commercial sectors should quickly establish a preparatory committee for the North-South barter joint management office. It is learned that the preparatory committee has tentatively designated 17 executive committee members, 7 from the Industrial Association, and 5 each from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Shipping Association. Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Municipal Industrial Association, will serve as the Chairman, and Liu Hongsheng, Chairman of the National Federation of Industrial Associations, and Xu Jiwei, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, will serve as the Vice Chairmen. The organization will be submitted at tomorrow's North-South Barter Design Committee meeting. If it is approved, it can be formally established.

### Public Utilities Request Improvement of Fee Collection Methods

[Report from this newspaper] Recently, the rise in prices has been alarming. The city's water, electricity, gas, telephone, and public transportation agencies have been deeply affected and are on the verge of collapse. They have requested the competent authorities to quickly improve the fee collection methods to cope with the prices that change several times a day. According to statistics from the Shanghai Waterworks Company, from March 5 to April 5, the company's income listed on the issued bills, calculated according to the exchange rate on the date of issuance, can be considered equivalent to over 77,000 British pounds in currency value. When converted according to the exchange rate when the funds were received, it only amounted to over 47,000 pounds. The company's losses due to slow collection of funds are considerable. Other companies are also in the same situation. The Shangli Power Company and the French Water and Electricity Company, etc., suffer losses of about half of their total income each month due to currency depreciation. The gas company regularly maintains more than one month of coal reserves, but it currently has only seven days' worth of reserves due to its inability to replenish them. As for the transportation sector, the city's public buses' total income each day is not enough to cover the cost of gasoline alone. The current oil reserves are not enough for half a month. The companies are facing great difficulties. It is believed that without improving the fee collection methods, they will be completely shut down. They have urgently requested immediate remedies. The competent authorities believe that public utilities are deeply and significantly related to the city's industrial production and social stability, and they are carefully studying countermeasures to the requests made by the companies.

### Citizens Who Have Not Received ID Cards Should Apply for Them as Soon as Possible

The Municipal Government announced that during this period of martial law, citizens, whether at home or abroad, must carry their ID cards with them for inspection by military police and Baojia personnel at any time. Those who do not carry their ID cards will be severely punished. Citizens of all ages who have registered their households but have not yet applied for ID cards must apply for ID cards from their local district offices as soon as possible, and have ordered Baojia personnel to strictly enforce compliance.

### Prices Soar Like Crazy; Vegetable, Fish and Meat Prices Rise the Most; Actual Sales of Spring Fashion Greatly Reduced; Many Large Companies Use Silver Dollars for Pricing

[Report from this newspaper] In recent weeks, the price increases have been like crazy, and the general salaried class has reached a stage where they cannot afford it. According to a research report by an academic group studying prices: In the past half month, the prices of vegetables, fish, and meat have risen the most rapidly, averaging more than 100,000 times higher than on August 19th. Next is soybean oil, and then rice and grain. The actual increase rate of gold bills and Yuan silver dollars is not as high as that of commodities. Because commodity prices fluctuate too quickly, the scene of the past when the legal tender depreciated sharply is reappearing on the market. Prices are different in the morning and afternoon, and prices vary from district to district. For example, a fried dough stick is priced at 3,000 yuan in the Central District, but in the Nanshi area, it is as high as 6,000 yuan. Because the purchasing power of ordinary citizens is becoming increasingly weak, actual sales in various stores are sluggish. In the past, fashion stores were booming every spring, but this year's actual sales have been reduced by about 60-70%, so the doors are unusually bleak. In the larger companies, both buyers and sellers have tacitly agreed to use silver dollars for pricing. Many companies have also added old-fashioned accountants who have been retired for many years to specialize in identifying the silver dollars delivered by customers. The trading methods of twenty years ago have reappeared, which is truly touching.

### Public Bus Route 3 Will Be Rerouted Starting Tomorrow; The Transportation Company Has Less Than Half a Month's Worth of Oil Reserves

[Report from this newspaper] Due to the soaring gasoline prices, the income from fares is not enough to purchase the required amount of oil, and the current oil reserves are decreasing day by day and are not enough for half a month. In order to avoid affecting the entire route, the city's public transportation company has decided to temporarily reroute the three routes starting tomorrow (the 21st): (1) Route 12, which originally detoured through Haining Road around North Henan Road, Tianmu Road, and North Zhejiang Road, turning into a section of Xinzhapu Road, will be rerouted to run straight along Haining Road to Xinzhapu Road. (2) The southern end of Route 13 will be changed to start from the Lujiabang Road Daxing Street bus terminal, with a temporary shuttle bus between Daxing Street and the original starting station, Nanmatou. The northern end, which originally ran from North Tibet Road through Xinjiang Road turning into North Zhejiang Road to the North Station, will be rerouted to turn from Central Tibet Road into East Beijing Road, Central Zhejiang Road, and North Zhejiang Road to reach the North Station. (3) Route 14, which originally ran from Zhabei Road through Jiangning Road to Yichang Road, will be rerouted to turn from Jiangning Road into Kangding Road, running west along the original Route 6 line to Caojiadu, with a temporary shuttle bus on the section from the intersection of Jiangning Road and Kangding Road to Yichang Road.

### The Index Review Committee Passes Recommendations; Compile and Use Weekly Index; Name of Institution to Be Determined; May Be Implemented as Early as the 27th of This Month

The Shanghai Municipal Cost of Living Index Compilation Review Committee, according to a request from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, convened an emergency meeting. The original text briefly stated: "The indices published in recent times are very accurate and cannot be criticized. However, this kind of index is quite effective when applied to a time when the situation is peaceful and prices are stable. However, at a time when the gold yuan notes are depreciating and prices are jumping several times a day, doubling in a few days, and the currency value is gradually falling miserably and going in the opposite direction, even women and children know that if the average index is used as the standard for issuing salaries, it has lost its balance function. Now, in order to take into account the lives of workers and to ensure that monthly wage income can be maintained, it is necessary to establish a special institution to study how to link prices and wages. A separate Wage Index Compilation Review Committee should be organized as soon as possible so that prices and wages can be balanced, the lives of workers can be maintained, society can be stabilized, and production can be increased, benefiting both sides."

### US Aid Rice - 300th Shipment Arrives - Ceremony Held on the Hai Su Transport Ship - Receiving the Sincere Friendship of the United States

[Report from Our Newspaper] The 300th shipment of US aid rice, totaling 9,050 long tons, arrived in Shanghai on the Hai Su Transport Ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company the day before yesterday and docked at Pier 1 of the China Merchants Bureau. A reception ceremony was held on the ship at 10:00 AM yesterday, presided over by Zhang Zhaoyuan, a member of the US Aid Utilization Committee. Attendees included Griffin, the Deputy Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration, Chen Liang, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Yang Chuo'an, the Chairman of the Food Procurement and Storage Committee, Cabot, the US Consul General in Shanghai, and more than 30 representatives from various agencies. After the ceremony began, Zhang Zhaoyuan delivered a speech, stating that the Hai Su Transport Ship's arrival in Shanghai with rice was the 300th ship to transport US aid to China, which was worth commemorating. He expressed great gratitude for the help given to the Chinese people by the American people and government. To date, the value of aid materials transported to China has reached 150 million US dollars, including over 9,000 long tons of rice, which, although not a large amount, has had a significant effect on enriching the supply of food for Shanghai residents and stabilizing their psychology. As for the supply of cotton for textile mills, it directly maintains the employment of over one million workers, and the number of indirectly benefited people is even greater. Gasoline and other oil products help maintain and develop transportation and public services. Fertilizer directly helps China's agricultural production, and coal supplies urgently needed fuel for power plants and general factories. All these kinds of material assistance have been of great help. Recently, the US Senate and House of Representatives passed a bill to extend the period of US aid appropriations, allowing the remaining 54 million US aid from this US aid program to continue to be allocated to materials needed by China and the implementation of rural reconstruction plans. He expressed his deep pleasure and hoped to accept the sincere friendship of the American people and government with a spirit of self-reliance. After Zhang's speech, Griffin delivered a speech, elaborating on the significance of US aid to China, and expressed his hope that China would achieve peace and success, so that the people would no longer suffer from the pain of civil war. He also said that after the victory of the war against Japan, President Truman specially sent General Marshall to China to work hard to promote the coordination of Chinese political parties. Although it was not successful, the original intention of the United States to hope that China could end the war and restore prosperity has never changed. Subsequently, Municipal Secretary-General Chen delivered a speech, quoting the ancient Chinese saying "It is easy to add flowers to brocade, but difficult to provide charcoal in the snow," comparing the effective assistance given by the United States to China in times of great difficulty. He expressed his deep gratitude on behalf of the six million citizens of Shanghai for this pure and precious friendship. The ceremony ended at 11:00 AM, and a reception was held, with guests and hosts enjoying themselves.

### Shanghai Council and Other Groups Jointly Telegraph, Calling on the Communist Party to Abandon Harsh Conditions

In view of the fact that the 24 articles proposed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are mostly harsh and detrimental to peace talks, the Shanghai Council, General Labor Union, Educational Association, Farmers' Association, Women's Association, and other groups, for the benefit of all newspapers and fellow countrymen, hereby record the original text as follows: At a time when the government is sincerely seeking peace and the people of the whole country are eager for peace and seeking to end the war, the CCP notified the government with 24 articles, limiting the reply to the 20th. At the same time, it is also gathering troops, going back on its promise of a ceasefire, fiercely attacking the bridgehead of the National Army north of the Yangtze River, and actively preparing to cross the river to the south. The peace talks under the attention of the whole country are no less than a blow to the head. The 24 articles proposed by the CCP and its husbands are mostly harsh. For example, the members of the united government and the chairman of its decision-making committee must be selected by the CCP, which is nominally united but actually monopolized. Secondly, the national system of the Republic of China must be changed and the legal system must be abolished, which is an attempt to destroy the glorious history and cultural system of our country for thousands of years in one fell swoop, which we cannot accept. In addition, the CCP forced the National Army to reorganize according to the model of Beiping, designated Jiangyin, Zhenjiang, Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang and other places as places for peaceful crossing of the Yangtze River, and took over the navy and air force, etc., in an attempt to cross the river without bloodshed and force the government to surrender. As for the confiscation of private capital, it clearly shows that the CCP is unwilling to abandon the violent policy of struggle and liquidation, which is deeply regrettable. It is hoped that the CCP can suddenly realize that it values the lives of the people and public opinion, immediately stop all military operations on the spot to fulfill its previous promises, and meet with sincerity to maintain the freedom of the people's lives. Both parties should agree that their troops can reorganize themselves in their respective defense zones under equal conditions, so that peace talks can continue and a comprehensive, reasonable and emotional peace can be realized. Otherwise, the responsibility for destroying peace, which is pointed out by ten fingers and watched by ten eyes, is very clear. This association and other groups are deeply concerned about the country and cannot remain silent at this critical moment of peace talks. Therefore, we specially jointly telegraph all groups and compatriots across the country to rise up together and call for a unified voice, so that under the supervision of the truly fair public opinion of our country, both parties can implement a ceasefire, tolerate each other, and save the peace talks from breaking down and the national destiny from being in danger. Then the country will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate.

At the same time, there will be major changes to the train schedule for both lines. The new train schedule was completely finalized last night, but the implementation date has not yet been determined, because it must wait for the through train from Beijing to Guangzhou to complete its full journey and the Ministry of Transportation's Joint Transportation Office to finalize the schedule, and then incorporate the current passenger train schedule before it can be implemented.

### Most of Shanghai's Fishing Transport and Fishing Boats Set Out to Sea to Fish

During this peak season for yellow croaker, the garrison headquarters, in consideration of the safety of the river defense and the livelihoods of fishermen and fish merchants, has specially organized and registered fishing boats to go out to sea to catch and sell fish. The registration procedures are also stipulated to be as fast and convenient as possible, so as not to delay the fishing season. It is learned that: the Shanghai Fisheries Association, in accordance with the instructions of the garrison headquarters, is rushing to handle the matter in charge of four places, including the Jiangquan Shanghai Fisheries Transport and Fishing Boat Management Office, the Marine Product Marketing Association, and the Fisheries Association of the seven counties in northern Jiangsu. Most of them have now set out to sea to catch and sell fish. Furthermore, it is learned that the previous reports in various newspapers about the opening of the ports of Fushan and Hupu were misreported. The fishing boats there have all been moved to Liuhekou for nearby fishing in order to facilitate inspection.

### Wang Jinming Sentenced to Death for Defrauding the Families of Criminals

[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Jinming, an unemployed vagrant, colluded with a person named Zhang Guohua between January and February this year, using the pretext of being able to find ways to bail out criminal suspects Su Youfu, Lu Gengsheng, and others detained at the First Detention Center of the District Court. He continuously defrauded the family members of the criminals, including Su Feng Guiying, Lu Asi, Chen Yang Ailan, Liu Xiaoya, Wu Xiaomei, and Huang Zhang Xingbin, of a large amount of activity fees and clothing. On February 28, at around 12:00 noon, he was encountered by Liu Xiaoya on East Changzhi Road, and she immediately reported him to the Huangpu Branch Bureau. After investigation and prosecution, the District Court concluded the trial yesterday. The court stated that although Wang took this approach due to lack of means to make a living, his targets were the families of criminals. These people relied on the fact that their husbands, brothers, and sons were in prison and eagerly hoped to regain their freedom, so they were obedient to the defendant in every possible way, allowing him to take whatever he wanted. However, the defendant specifically carried out fraud on these pitiful worms, which was truly heinous. Therefore, although the situation was pitiful, the heart was truly punishable, and he was sentenced to four years of imprisonment as a warning.

### Through Train from Beijing to Guangzhou Enters the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Yesterday, Many Difficulties Remain for Formal Operation

[Report from Our Newspaper] The through train from Beijing to Guangzhou has successfully completed the journeys on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways and entered the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway yesterday. After passing Nanchang, it arrived at Zhangshu Town on schedule. Passengers crossed the Gan River and changed to the Guangdong-Hankou Railway train to continue their journey. The trains allocated by the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau can return to Hangzhou today. Although the Joint Transportation Office of the Ministry of Transportation has high hopes for through train service, there are many difficulties. After this trial run, it is not yet certain whether formal service can begin immediately. There are two major difficulties: (1) The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been busy with military transport recently, and the tracks are often congested by military vehicles. With the increase in passenger transport on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, the through train from Beijing to Guangzhou may not be able to arrive on schedule on these two lines. (2) The passenger fares on the three lines are different and adjusted from time to time, making it impossible to set joint transportation fares. For example, on the first day the train departed from Beijing and Shanghai, the two lines immediately increased fares tenfold. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway also adjusted fares the day before yesterday, and announced that they would be adjusted every five days after publication. The Guangdong-Hankou Railway's fares are even calculated in silver dollars, and the market prices of "big heads" change from morning to night. Although fares do not change as frequently as the market prices of "big heads," they may be adjusted at any time. For example, different fares have already occurred during this trial run. Yesterday, passengers crossing the Gan River were charged 10,000 yuan for the crossing fee and 90,000 yuan for the luggage fee (limited to 50 kilograms, doubled for exceeding), which was calculated according to the newly adjusted standards of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and was not included in the original fee.

### National Property Inventory Commission Begins Accepting People's Accusations - The Commission is Internally Divided into Five Groups

[Report from Our Newspaper] The members of the Supervisory Yuan's National Property Inventory Commission stationed in Shanghai hosted a press conference at 3:00 PM yesterday. Members in attendance included Xiong Zaiwei, Tang Honglie, Liang Shangdong, and nine others, chaired by Xiong Zaiwei, the convener, who explained the commission's position of "striving to work with a completely fair and selfless attitude, so that the country's property can truly be taken from the people and used for the people, and not allowing anyone or any kind of power to deceive, manipulate, or control it for personal gain under the guise of public interest."

The internal organization of the commission is based on work objectives and is divided into five groups, with the following allocation of personnel: Commission Convener: Xiong Zaiwei. Group 1 (National Treasury Bank): Tang Honglie, Xiong Zaiwei, Hu Wenhui. Group 2 (Gold, Silver, and Foreign Exchange): Liang Shangdong, Chen Yunge, Ren Bingjun. Group 3 (State-Run Enterprises): Sun Yulin, Yu Zhenzhou, Wang Xiangchen. Group 4 (Enemy Puppet Property): Liu Pingjiang, Jin Yueguang, Yu Peihou. Group 5 (US Aid Materials): Gu Huangxiang, Huang Huangshi, Guo Zhongkui. (The first person in each group above is the convener of that group).

Regarding the investigation techniques in Shanghai, the members stated that they would be used flexibly and adapted to local conditions, so it is difficult to provide a concrete explanation. The location of the property inventory is not limited to the city of Shanghai, as this is a national issue. The focus of the investigation is not on the amount of national property, but on exposing old abuses and further imposing penalties and impeachments. The commission has begun accepting people's accusations, and as of today, a number of complaints have been received. However, the Supervisory Yuan does not respond to people's complaints in accordance with the law, nor can it provide rewards.

### Zhao Changgen Sentenced to Five Years Imprisonment for Attempted Murder of His Brother

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhao Changgen was sentenced to five years imprisonment yesterday by Judge Zhu Chanping of the District Court for attempted murder of his brother.

Neighbors Cao Bingrong and others heard the noise and rushed over. Changgen directly admitted to the crime. He was sent to the police station and transferred to the District Attorney's Office for investigation and prosecuted for attempted murder.

### Another Anonymous Letter Received in the Decapitated Dismemberment Case, Police of District Attorney's Office Arrested People Without Success

[Report from Our Newspaper] During the secret investigation by the District Attorney's Office into the decapitated dismemberment case on Jinji Road, the Police Office of the District Attorney's Office suddenly received another anonymous letter yesterday morning, stating that the cruel murderer in the dismemberment case is currently hiding in a certain place on West Nanjing Road in the city, and hoping that police officers would be dispatched quickly to arrest him. After receiving the report, the Police Office of the District Attorney's Office reported to the prosecuting attorney in charge and dispatched multiple police officers to the address for inquiry. However, the address is the Zhongyuan Electrical Materials Factory, and no murderer in the case was hiding there. The prosecuting attorney now intends to list the allegations in the letter as one of the investigation clues and will periodically summon the person in charge of the factory to court for questioning.

### Principal Offender Arrested and Handed Over to the Garrison Headquarters in the Attempted Murder Case on Tibet Road

[Report from Our Newspaper] On February 22 of this year, an attempted murder case occurred in front of the Oriental Hotel on Tibet Road. At that time, the victim Zhu Gengsheng was kidnapped by Qin Shibin, an acquaintance, and a group of people to Qunyu Lane nearby. They first took away his weapons and then repeatedly stabbed his hands and feet with sharp blades, and fired several shots as a warning before dispersing. After the incident, the police station immediately sent personnel to investigate and successively arrested three suspects, Xu Jinshan, Chen Genlin, and Lin Amao, who have been sent to the District Attorney's Office for interrogation. As for the principal offender Qin Shibin, the police station did not receive a tip-off until the 7th of this month and arrested him at No. 4, Lane 224, Qufu Road. After interrogation, he directly admitted to the murder. However, due to the seriousness of the circumstances, the police station will transfer him to the garrison headquarters for punishment in accordance with military law.

### Three Defendants Given Lighter Sentences in the Case of Attempting to Embezzle Enemy and Puppet Ironware

[Report from Our Newspaper] Song Zhen was a plainclothes police officer at the Xinshi Street Police Branch in the city, Zuo Dihua was the police chief of the branch, and Xu Ruyun was the head of the first unit of the twelfth district in the branch's jurisdiction. There were many scrap iron shovels, iron bars, etc. near Xu's residence when the enemy and puppets surrendered. Later, Xu gathered the scrap iron in a thatched shed without a house number at No. 470 Lane on the road, which was kept by resident Zhuang Jinlong. However, it was not reported to the主管機關(zhuguan jiguan, roughly translated to authorities in charge), and was later learned by Zuo, who introduced Li Rujin to Xu to negotiate the sale, but it was unsuccessful. On April 10 of last year, Xin Yuekang, a small contractor, needed iron shovels for organizing the venue for the National Games and attempted to buy them, so Zuo introduced Xu to bring a number of workers to carry them. Local residents tried to stop them, but Zhuang went to report to Xu, who arrived on the scene and explained Song's identity, claiming that the iron shovels were being transported by the police bureau's car. The onlookers dispersed, and Xin transported the iron shovels away by truck. On the third day, Xu invited Song and Zuo to Xin's place. Xin first gave Song 500 法幣(Fabii, currency at the time), which Song转交(zhuanjiao, handed over) to Xu. After Xu left, Song and Zuo took another 3,500 yuan from Xin. The incident was later discovered by the Municipal Police Bureau, which transferred the case to the District Court for trial in accordance with the Special Cases Litigation Regulations. They were sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. Later, the defendants applied for retrial, and the Supreme Court of Shanghai sent the case back for retrial. The District Court has now concluded the trial again, stating that their crime of embezzlement is extremely clear. 自主財物(zizhu caiwu, independently managed properties/belongings), the greed for small profits, and the occasional violation of criminal law, after reviewing the circumstances of the crime, it is still excusable. The court has specially reduced their sentences by one-half, each reducing their sentences to three years and six months of imprisonment.

### The Fundraising Results of the Poor Children's Work-Study Institute are Very Good

The Shanghai Poor Children's Work-Study Institute held an all-day radio fundraising campaign on Children's Day, and the results were very good. The collection of donations has now been completed, but it is regrettable that the addresses of some donors are unknown, or the names and addresses match but they did not call to donate. This type of situation is probably due to miscommunication over the phone. The institute hopes that donors can send their donations to the institute's office at No. 354 West Nanjing Road, Daguan Society, or call 37646. It is also learned that the biggest gain from this fundraising campaign was that the Lu Genji Construction Factory generously donated all the tiles for building houses.

### Two Criminals Arrested for Specializing in Stealing Bicycles - Confessed to More Than Ten Cases

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Songshan Road Police Branch recently received a report that two habitual thieves known as "Killer Quick Horse," Zhu Youwei and Sun Xinglong, lived at No. 5 Daren Lane, Fuxing Middle Road. Section Chief Zhong ordered police officers to rush to the location, and they arrested the two criminals and brought them to the bureau. According to their confessions, they committed 11 bicycle thefts in Shanghai between August of last year and January of this year. In addition, they also stole four bicycles in Hangzhou. Based on the confessions of the two criminals, they recovered six stolen bicycles and a large number of parts from four locations, including Zhang Bonan's home at No. 4 Tangjia Lane, Jinji Road, the Kuaili Bicycle Shop at No. 150 Fuxing Middle Road, Wu Fusheng's home at No. 246 Jianguo West Road, and Yang Tailong's residence at No. 26, Lane 478, Xie Xu Road.

### He Yugan Military Academy Cadre Returns After Desertion, Bitterly Hates Jia Yibin, Tears Flowing in the Wind and Snow

— Our Reporter Liu Jianxiong

[Our Paper, Jiaxing, 17th Dispatch] The First Corps of the Pre-cadre Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, stationed in Jiaxing, had some cadets who deserted freely on the evening of the 6th of this month. This not only caused alarm among the people of Jiaxing, but also aroused concern throughout the country. Everyone knows that the predecessor of the Pre-cadre Corps was the patriotic and intellectual youth who responded to the call of the leader "100,000 Youth to Join the Army" during the war. They had an indelible "glorious history" on the Burma Road during the War of Resistance. After the victory and return, under the leadership of Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo, they were forged to be stronger and more decisive. Because they have been stationed in Jiaxing for more than four years, they are regarded by the people as the only "model soldiers" in China. This sudden and unfortunate incident has indeed been of concern to the people of the whole country. Although the incident has now been successfully resolved, readers may not fully understand the causes and consequences of this incident. For this reason, our reporter visited General Xu Sixian, Director of the Pre-cadre Bureau, and Li Tianduo, the Corps Commander who returned after deserting, and the cadets, respectively. The process and current situation are reported as follows:

Reasons for Launching the Incident

"The cadets were completely deceived and have no responsibility. Jia Yibin cannot shirk his responsibility." This is what Director Xu and Corps Commander Li said first when talking to reporters. From this, we can understand that the cause of this incident was only Jia Yibin. So, who is Jia Yibin? He is the former Director of the Pre-cadre Bureau and concurrently the Corps Commander of the First Corps, a native of Hubei, about forty years old. This person has petty cleverness but no great wisdom. During his tenure, he used the enthusiasm and frustration of young people, used "democracy" as a cover to deceive students, and attempted to use students as personal tools. He was usually extreme in his words and deeds, and used slogans to cater to the youth to incite and win the favor of the cadets. Since the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, he has been deeply poisoned by defeatism, and his attitude and words and deeds have become more obvious. He was transferred to the Ministry of National Defense for review and dismissed from his post, and transferred to serve in the Nanjing Garrison Command. Instead of reflecting on his mistakes, he became angry and resentful, and secretly arranged for his confidants, hoping to wait for an opportunity to act. Recently, when the Communist Party deployed troops on the banks of the Yangtze River, he thought the time was ripe and hoped to dominate the area. He sneaked into Jiaxing and hid in the countryside to plan a rebellion.

Secretly Planning a Rebellion in Jiaxing

Jia came to Jiaxing in plain clothes on the 2nd and secretly gathered his confidants. The original plan was to launch the rebellion on the 16th. So why did he act hastily on the evening of the 6th? There are two reasons why he could not carry out the original plan calmly. First, the Pre-cadre Corps had been ordered to be stationed in Fuzhou, and everything was being actively prepared. Second, his actions on the afternoon of the 6th had been discovered by the current Corps Commander Li Tianduo. Because Li was kind-hearted, he believed that he had been with Jia for many years and had a deep personal relationship. Therefore, he asked someone to inform him that he wanted to persuade him and tell him the righteousness and the stakes. However, Jia knew that the matter had been exposed and replied, "There is no need to come to see me, I will come to see him." Therefore, without waiting for Li to meet him, he decided to launch the rebellion ahead of schedule. This was at six o'clock on the evening of the 6th.

The Evening of Coercing the Desertion

At this time, Corps Commander Li was discussing all matters concerning the relocation of the corps to Fuzhou with Deputy Corps Commander Pan and Corps Adjutant Qi in the office. Jia's confidants had secretly deployed armed guards around the office. First, one or two so-called "representatives" asked Corps Commander Li, "What is the future of our corps?" Soon, Jia also entered the room, and the external security was further strengthened, and the situation suddenly became tense. After Jia sat down, he talked to Li about trivial matters. Then, more than a dozen cadets broke into the room and reported to Li, "Now we are ready to do it, listen to the opinions of the Corps Commander and Deputy Corps Commander." Li asked, "What exactly do you want to do?" Their answer was, "Only go to the mountains!" Li asked again, "Is there no other way to go besides going to the mountains? Now the government wants us to go to Fuzhou, isn't this the right way? You should study it." At that time, Jia said sternly, "Only do this, it must be done this way." At that time, Li and others all expressed their disapproval. Jia then pulled out the original planned marching map, and while monitoring Li and others, he falsely issued Corps Commander Li's order to "implement combat readiness march," ordering each company to carry all guns, ammunition, bedding and equipment and wait for departure.

At that time, it was close to midnight, and most of the cadets woke up in a daze, not knowing the truth, and were deceived by him. However, the 15th and 16th teams (i.e., the political work team and the transportation team) became suspicious because the order came suddenly and refused to follow. When Jia heard the news, he was taking Corps Commander Li to persuade them. Halfway there, he turned back because of lack of time and hurriedly coerced Corps Commander Li to lead more than 1,600 cadets to Wuzhen. Pan and Qi took the opportunity to escape at this time.

Major Riot Among Cadets

Their team arrived in Tongxiang on the 7th. Most of the cadets were exhausted from the long journey and had not eaten, so they complained. At the same time, Corps Commander Li, who was being monitored, took the opportunity to reveal the news and persuaded the cadets to return to the team. Therefore, some deliberately fell behind and sneaked back. In the evening, the team arrived in Wuzhen, which belongs to Huzhou. Jia then gathered the cadets to speak, vaguely revealing that the destination was to break away from all fetters. He thought this would encourage morale, but it backfired. Once the secret was revealed, the cadets immediately rioted. Seeing that the situation was not good, Jia threatened and intimidated them, saying, "You will be killed if you go back." Therefore, the cadets were filled with resentment and terror, and they were in a dilemma. The troops continued to advance, but were blocked by the local team. They detoured and took the wrong route, and clashed with the blocking team. Also, because there were many cadets and the line was long, the team was extremely chaotic. Jia knew that there would be danger, so he went on a boat alone. The cadets who were monitoring Corps Commander Li also abandoned their mission for the sake of their own safety. So Li took this opportunity to escape and return. At the same time, about 500 cadets returned on the evening of the 8th. At this time, Jia Yibin was doomed to failure.

The Rebellion Was Successfully Resolved

As for the headquarters, Deputy Corps Commander Pan and Corps Adjutant Qi contacted the 11th Traffic Police Corps stationed in Jiaxing after escaping and sent personnel to pursue and suppress them. At the same time, they telegraphed the Ministry of National Defense for instructions and discussed solutions with the Zhejiang Provincial Garrison Headquarters and the China Youth Corps and other agencies. General Xu Sixian, Director of the Pre-cadre Bureau, also came to Jiaxing on the 8th to sit in the Corps Headquarters and contacted the counties by telephone to personally request assistance in comforting and suppressing the rebellion. The government authorities knew that most of the cadets who deserted this time were deceived. In addition to sending troops to pursue and intercept them, they also sent planes to distribute leaflets to clarify the truth and explain the righteousness. The China Youth Corps also sent important personnel to shout near Mount Mogan, explaining the government's intentions. At this time, more than 700 cadets who went to the mountains, after the truth was revealed, went down the mountains to await the government's disposal. Therefore, the successful resolution of this incident was not only due to Director Xu's tireless day and night command and the effective comfort and suppression of the provincial and county teams, but also due to the fact that the leaflets distributed by the planes and the shouts of the China Youth Corps personnel were really helpful.

The Fate of Jia Yibin

Most of the cadets who were deceived by Jia Yibin have returned. As of now, the corps has 2,239 cadets, only 131 less than the original number of 2,493 (excluding 133 who were sent to the hospital due to illness or injury). About 50 people were killed or injured in this incident, and some cadets were discouraged and returned home after this encounter. According to the recent return of the cadets, "Jia Yibin only brought a dozen or twenty people, all of whom have changed into plain clothes. Jia also told these dozen or twenty people about his fate, saying: (1) You will beat me to death. (2) I can only commit suicide. (3) You will not send me to the garrison headquarters." From this, it can be seen that it will not be difficult to capture Jia Yibin in the short term.

Reorganization Completed and Classes Resume

After Corps Commander Li returned, he suffered great stimulation this time and suffered a nervous breakdown. He is currently recuperating. The reorganization of the troops and the handling of the aftermath are temporarily presided over by General Xu Sixian, Director of the Pre-cadre Bureau. According to Xu, the initial reorganization has been completed. There were originally four battalions and sixteen companies. Currently, three battalions have been formed, and the reorganization will be completed soon. However, many guns and bedding were lost in this incident. In addition to setting up a bonus system to ask the counties to help collect them, personnel were sent to Wuxing, Deqing, Tongxiang and other counties to investigate the casualties and the loss of weapons, and to properly handle them separately. The Ministry of National Defense was also telegraphed to request remedy. Therefore, classes will resume from the 25th and training will be carried out according to the original plan. The cadets who returned after deserting this time all felt remorse and even cried bitterly."

[Our Paper, Jinshan, 17th Dispatch] Hu Hengchang, the owner of the Hu Qiangyi fish shop in Dongshi Town, Songyin, Jinshan County, raised a hen. On the afternoon of the 16th, it hatched fifteen chicks. It was found that one of the chicks was yellow in color and had four feet, resembling a frog. The anus was located on the abdomen, and it moved very quickly. Food excretion was normal. It caused a sensation in the town, and the audience was amazed. Now, the Songyin Town Office has been informed to raise it properly and will purchase it and send it to the Jinshan County People's Education Center for exhibition for biologists to study.

### Jiangnan Levies Self-Defense Donations

[Our Paper, Zhenjiang, 18th Dispatch] The counties in the First Pacification District were previously ordered to levy special self-defense donations. Commander Ding Zhipan recently sent an urgent telegram to the jurisdiction, limiting all to be completed before April 25. In addition, supplementary measures were formulated based on the previously promulgated detailed rules for fundraising and expenditure, and distributed to the counties for compliance. The main points of these supplementary measures are as follows: (1) The special self-defense donations payable by natural persons may be paid in kind (rice) according to the actual situation of the donor. Corporations and legally adjusted tax rates shall still be converted into gold yuan coupons in principle. (2) The collection of in-kind payments shall designate a proxy treasury (Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank) to receive, set up warehouses for storage. (3) The counties shall notify donors to pay directly to the treasury, whether in-kind or in gold yuan coupons. (4) If the donor pays in silver dollars, the proxy treasury shall convert it at the current exchange rate.

### 100 Meters of Land, 1,000 Piculs of Rice, 30 Taels of Gold Changzhou National Taxation Bureau Accused of Corruption

[Our Paper, Wujin, 18th Dispatch] Sun Mingshu, Director of the County National Taxation Bureau, was originally the Director of the Goods Tax Bureau. He usually relied on his strong background (rumored to be the nephew of a certain party elder) and often traveled between Beijing and Shanghai. When the National Assembly was held that year, he conspired to become a staff member of the meeting place, swayed back to Changzhou with a red satin strip from the county, and frequented restaurants, flaunting himself in front of people, looking like a delegate of the National Assembly. His boring appearance made people laugh. Later, the Direct Tax Bureau and the Goods Tax Bureau were merged into the National Taxation Bureau, and Sun took advantage of the opportunity to become the Director, arbitrarily placed his cronies, and excluded dissidents, which once caused major disputes. Recently, he was accused by Liu Shounian, a citizen of this county, of four points of corruption and dereliction of duty and sued to the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Supervisory Office. The facts are approximately as follows: (1) In October of last year, Director Sun heard that the liquor tax would increase tenfold, so on October 1, he sent Han Jinkun, the Secretary of the Bureau, to Zhenjiang to inquire. On the 2nd, he returned and reported. Sun immediately summoned the rice merchants of the Yixing branch to give face-to-face instructions. On the same day, he contacted the liquor merchants to pay the prepaid tax in advance, colluding with each other to obtain private profit of 20,000 gold yuan (equivalent to 1,000 piculs of rice). After being reported, the Ministry of Finance sent the inspector Zhou Keming to Changzhou to investigate thoroughly. Sun Mingshu gave Zhou Keming 2,000 gold yuan coupons, and the matter ended uneventfully. (2) Wan An, an employee of the Bureau, never came to the office to work and had another job outside. He was paid a salary in the Bureau in name only. (3) On September 25 of last year, Director Sun celebrated his birthday in a big way. The entire Bureau stopped working for two days and went to Wuxi for fun, under the pretext of congratulating him. (4) In handling the profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the first half of the 37th year, he colluded with the Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce to fraudulently collect an additional tax of 360,000 gold yuan, equivalent to 30 taels of gold. Because the Wujin Chamber of Commerce has always followed the tax collection in Wuxi, Wuxi calculated the tax at 200 times the 36th year, while Changzhou calculated the tax at 60 times, seeking private gain and engaging in malpractice, which was known to everyone in the entire Bureau. ... The indictment clearly points out the names, dates, and months, which are very credible. The Supervisory Office has telegraphed Wujin County to investigate and verify the case nearby. The county government sent Section Chief Zhu of the Finance Section to conduct the investigation. The inside story is turbulent, and rumors are rife. According to people familiar with the situation, the National Taxation Bureau also has many problems with tobacco and alcohol taxes.

### On the Art of Employing People

— Xu Daolin

The year before last, when I returned from Taiwan, I met Mr. Chen Guangfu. I told him that there was great potential for tourism in Taiwan, and advised him to start working on it quickly. He said that it was not that he did not know how to do it, nor that he did not want to do it, but that he did not have the right people yet. This sentence fully expressed that he was a person in the business, and made me even more clear why his business was successful.

I know a few contemporary giants. They are indeed loyal to the country and work hard day and night. They all hold several important positions and spend the whole day attending meetings, giving instructions, giving speeches, attending ceremonies, and receiving foreign guests. They are already very busy, but their desks are piled with piles of official documents, waiting for them to approve them one by one, and sometimes they even have to revise them word by word. The waiting room is full of guests waiting to see them, each patiently waiting there with newspapers and magazines. The most difficult thing is their group of high-ranking subordinates, each with their briefcases full of so-called "most important" official documents, chasing from the office to the meeting place, and from the meeting place to the residence, waiting for their approval. Sometimes, such a hard chase and wait lasts for three or five days, but still cannot catch these adults in a relatively free time, because they are at some venue talking about their great economic ideals and their philosophical concepts.

To say that they do not want to do well, they are followers of ideology and ardent patriots. To say that they are not working hard, they eat little and do many things, and each of them is highly overworked. But why are they still unable to achieve anything? This is because they only know how to do things but do not know how to employ people. The ancient saying "A wise ruler makes seeking talent his business" is not something their brains can comprehend.

Some more enlightened dignitaries seem to understand the importance of "seeking talent." They are indeed consulting widely and seeking talent everywhere. They will admire your high reputation and will not hesitate to condescend to visit you. When you come, they will greet you with open arms, give you the seat of honor at dinner, and offer you wine diligently. They will give you high positions, honorable titles, and rich gifts. They may even entrust you with an important position and give you full power. But their reason for employing you is not to seek talent for the country's cause, but to consider their personal status. They do not want to give you the opportunity to develop your ambitions, but to bring you in to decorate their facade. Before long, they will either feel that you are not obedient enough, somewhat obstructive, or fear that your wings are gradually growing and you cannot be controlled. As a result, they will become estranged and discriminatory, and then discriminate and exclude you. In the end, it will always end in an unhappy breakup. The ancient books say that it is difficult to become prosperous and difficult to obtain talent, it is difficult to use talent, and it is difficult to entrust talent. This is exactly the reason.

Therefore, the first element of the success of historical figures is to know people and make good use of them. Knowing means being able to know people, and making good use of them means being able to employ people. But those who know people may not be able to employ people, and those who can employ people must know people. Those who are good at employing people can discover the strengths of each person and will find opportunities for them to发挥 them—there is no one in the world who is completely without strengths, and there is no one who does not want to发挥 their strengths. Those who are good at employing people know how to increase the work interest of each person, know how to increase the work ability of each person, and know how to increase the cohesiveness of the entire group. Therefore, those who rely on changing personnel to reorganize their business are certainly correct, but those who can use the original personnel, without adding new people, without expelling people, only relying on the allocation of work and the application of rewards and punishments, and can turn the bad into good and the useless into useful, so-called embracing everything and making the best use of talent, and can change the atmosphere and improve efficiency, this can truly be considered someone who knows how to employ people.

People who know how to employ people must have the wisdom to know people. How easy is it to know people! But there is also a secret, which is to cultivate the wisdom to know people, and must strive to break inherent prejudices. And one's inherent prejudices must be based on selfish interests. In other words, the selfish cannot know people, and to know people, one must first restrain oneself. A truly talented person knows everyone, but sometimes does not know, because they are unwilling to know, so they do not know. This is one point. Furthermore, it is absolutely not easy to know the quality of talent, but it is extremely easy to know it relatively. As the saying goes, "One is not afraid of not knowing the goods, but of being afraid that the goods cannot be compared." But in general, those who employ people are unwilling to put in the effort in this one word "compare," and still say that talent is hard to come by. How can one not sigh! This is the second point. Also, how is a person's talent? Words are not proof, and one test will reveal it. The so-called "true gold is not afraid of fire." A person who knows how to seek talent for the cause will not be stingy in giving people a chance to show their skills. Yao tested Shun with the world, let alone the rest! This is the third point.

People who know how to employ people must also have a virtue, which is the concept of helping others to succeed. Our purpose in employing a person is to cultivate him, not to help me. Our purpose in teaching him to do something is for the sake of the thing itself, not for the sake of my interests. If we employ people with such a starting point, how can people not work hard and devote their lives? Bo Le saw the thousand-mile horse under the salt cart and cried bitterly, and the thousand-mile horse also wailed in pain, because Bo Le loved the horse, and was not a horse dealer who exploited the horse for profit.

Finally, those who can achieve great things, that is, those who are best at employing people, must also possess one condition, which is the ability to tolerate others, and the magnanimity to allow others to develop as much as possible without feeling wary. (That is, what Yangming said, "the ability to tolerate everything, and the heart to compete with no one"). This magnanimity is also another side of indifference. However, true indifference not only sees fame, wealth, and power as dim, but also sees achievements as dim, and it is still obscured, and will still be obscured by things. However, indifference is not negativity. The opposite of indifference is enthusiasm. Those who are distraught when they do not see their ruler for three months cannot be called indifferent. Indifference is also not coldness, because indifference does not hinder ambition, and it has absolute right and wrong. However, those who love great achievements and hate evil like an enemy cannot be called indifferent, because "love," "like," and "hate like an enemy" all move one's spirit and will, and therefore cannot become indifferent. Regardless of how the situation and environment change, whether it is success or failure, good times or bad times, one does not forget oneself when one is successful, and does not become frustrated when one is unsuccessful. The emotions and will in one's heart are always as calm as ever. This is true indifference.

There are many types of people, some are witty, some are steady, some are brave, some are cautious, some are virtuous, and some are capable. Those who are strong in this must be weak in that. Making friends mostly requires that one's personalities are compatible, but when employing people, one must never stubbornly establish boundaries and be partial. One must clearly recognize the environment and be practical. One must truly "seek people for the sake of things" in order to achieve "making the best use of people."

People's strengths are different, and the needs of the environment are also different. Regarding the standards for employing people now, I believe that those in high positions must value integrity. As for the talent for governing affairs, I believe that one should possess four conditions: 1. Insight, 2. Method, 3. Integrity, and 4.魄力(Po Li: courage and decisiveness). It is best if all four conditions can be met. If one cannot meet all four, I believe that insight is more important than method, method is more important than integrity, and integrity is more important than魄力(Po Li). Those who possess all four and can also know how to support the younger generation and nurture talent, and engage in the work of cultivating people and trees, are even more worthy of being the best among people.

Some people work hard but have very poor abilities, and some people have abilities but are unwilling to work hard. Between the two, we should of course reward those who work hard and dismiss those who are unwilling to work hard. However, those who are good at employing people will definitely put in effort in this situation, research the reasons why he is unwilling to work hard, and try to correct them. Because he knows that a person's desire to seek use and seek knowledge is his good ability, and there is no difference between it and a person's desire to survive. (End)

### Market Stroll

— Observer from the Stands

Silver Dollars Flow Back to the Central Bank; Employees Subsidize Interest for Two Days

For the past two days, the Central Bank has been actively working to recall silver dollars.

The silver dollars that flowed out during the pay period have been secretly and actively collected back in the past two days.

In the future, the index will be announced weekly, making it even more hectic for manufacturers to secure funds for payroll. Therefore, the Central Bank preparing silver dollar reserves has also become a routine matter.

The Central Bank's task of preparing silver dollars is the most difficult of all its official duties. This is because the amount required for military salaries is unimaginably large. What is released to commercial firms in this city is just a drop in the bucket.

The quantity of silver dollars needed by the Central Bank is particularly large, making its task of collecting them especially arduous. The skill lies in collecting silver dollars without causing their price to rise.

Over the past two days, the Central Bank has demonstrated its skill very well.

News keeps coming in: Previously, it was widely claimed that the Ministry of Finance had purchased a large amount of gold from the United States, which had already been shipped to Shanghai. Yesterday, it was again widely claimed that the Ministry of Finance had purchased a large amount of silver from the United Kingdom, which had already arrived.

The Central Bank has been able to secure cooperation from the press to announce news favorable to controlling the market, whether true or false, which is always good.

Therefore, let me also make an effort: [The Central Bank has received a large shipment of gold; the Central Bank has received a large shipment of silver. The gold is to be released into the market, and the silver is to be minted into silver dollars. Specifically, it is to mint Yuan Shikai-head dollars]. But I must declare that I am only acting as a mouthpiece and cannot be held responsible, because I myself do not believe it.

Our efforts are having an effect. Not only have general commodity prices not risen in the past two days, but interest rates have even increased. Silver dollars, on the other hand, have had their interest subsidized for two days.

Those buying silver dollars should not be anxious. With weekly pay periods, there will be at least one day each week when the subsidized interest can be fully recovered, with some profit to be made. However, you must hold onto the silver dollars and wait for this opportunity.

If you sell them as soon as you get them, of course, you will be secretly suppressed and forced to sell at a lower price.

However, those who buy silver dollars with their wages have no choice but to sell them as soon as they get them, so suppressing and buying them up is a sure thing.

In the past, when the Central Bank squeezed small merchants, it would buy up the IOUs of shaky firms at discounted prices. It was severely criticized by the business community and has now become much more sensible, openly declaring "this will not happen again"!

However, if soft tactics cannot be turned into hard ones, the existence of the Central Bank loses its meaning.

The silver dollars in the hands of wage earners have now become the target of attack. The performance of the past two days has been quite successful.

Wage earners are the weak, a scattered bunch, not comparable to wealthy merchants who cannot be bullied!

You see: The labor sector is demanding to be paid in silver dollars. However, the current approach is to announce the index weekly, which means: take gold yuan. Therefore, the issuance rate of gold yuan has been well-arranged.

Indeed, once military salaries are paid in silver dollars, it is impossible to change course midway. Otherwise, there would be an uproar.

I greatly admire the Central Bank's success in controlling the silver dollar market over the past two days. However, I always feel concerned for the Central Bank, holding my breath. Because it is not easy for a clever housewife to maintain things for long without rice to cook. The Central Bank is more skilled than a clever housewife and can cook without rice.

### The Strange and Complicated Evolution of the Case of Drug Trafficking Ring Cracked in Qingdao: Huang Gongru Sends a Letter to Our Newspaper's Reporter Expressing Profound Grief, Stating This Case Involves Issues of Morality, Reason, and Conscience

[Special Dispatch from Our Qingdao Correspondent on the 15th] Huang Gongru, formerly the Chief of Staff of the Qingdao Garrison Headquarters, currently a Senior Advisor in the Sui Region, sent a letter to our newspaper's reporter regarding the corruption of personnel in the Qingdao Garrison Headquarters as reported by our newspaper on the 2nd and 5th of this month, offering explanations in extremely mournful language. The letter roughly stated, "The case of fraud at the Xiaogang Inspection Station on March 12th was initially very simple. Upon discovery, punishments were carried out according to the law, and guilt was assigned where it belonged. However, after repeated evolutions, some people ultimately used clandestine (original) means to distort right and wrong, to exclude dissidents, to shield relatives and personal interests, and to use it as an excuse to harm the loyal and good, thus creating a bizarre and complicated situation that cannot be properly resolved." The letter also directly pointed out that the news released by the reporter had "caused significant errors and responsibility for inaccurate reporting. However, the case's circumstances are tortuous and changes are strange and sudden, and even those involved can scarcely understand the entire process. It is difficult for you to obtain sufficient materials when interviewing for news, so you should not be overly blamed. I am the Chief of Staff Huang who, out of suspicion, ordered the inspection of the Yuan Feng Company, obtained evidence, and was the first to expose this case of corruption and fraud. Because of pressure, and under orders to handle the matter in a way that minimizes its impact, I proceeded with the handling. In the end, I disagreed with this method of prioritizing private interests over public duty and angered a group of selfish petty people. They then conspired, fabricated schemes, and falsely accused me of being a suspect. The Deputy Commander Xiang Chuan Yuan (Reporter's Note: Deputy Commander of the Garrison Headquarters) dealt me an unexpected blow, forcing me to leave my post. In the end, there was no evidence, no reason. Although I have left, a perfunctory resolution is still difficult to achieve; only keeping the matter secret will not solve the problem." The letter further stated, "The evolution of this case to this day is not merely a matter of law, but also involves issues of people's morality, reason, natural justice, and conscience, that is, whether there is still truth, justice, good, evil, right, and wrong in this society? It is a test. I am the first to be sacrificed in this multitude of contradictions. I am silently watching the consequences of this case." The letter also made the following three corrections: "(1) The report on the 5th stating that Chief of Staff Huang's order to inspect the Yuan Feng Company was indeed correct, because that company was a drug trafficking organization for bandits, and it was the firm receiving funds from the bandit region. The corruption and fraud at the Xiaogang Inspection Station was also exposed because of this. So, from this, it can be known that I am the whistleblower of the case, not a suspect. ... (2) The case occurred in Xiaogang, the corrupt organization was the inspection station, and the main culprit was the station chief, Yu Jingcheng. The case itself has nothing to do with the officers in the Garrison Headquarters. Those outside the Garrison Headquarters who colluded with Station Chief Yu in committing the crime are now reversing the priorities, as if Zhang Tong's responsibility is serious, but in reality, it is not. (3) I have resigned three times already. I submitted my resignation request as early as February 9th. Although Deputy Commander Xiang agreed to forward it, the commanding officer did not approve it. The lesson this time is that I would rather die than continue to do this. Commander Liu issued an order to transfer me back to the Sui Region to continue in my original position. Although the timing is coincidental, no superior would ever transfer an officer suspected of corruption to a senior management position in a governing department during a concurrent job opportunity. As for the so-called 'has already been placed under surveillance,' frankly speaking, there is some absurd recording." (Reporter's Note: The reporter's report was based on information disclosed by relevant parties. More than a month has passed since the case occurred, and the authorities have not yet issued any official statements. The original letter is published above.)

The natives of the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific still use ancient methods to hunt sharks. One person enters the sea as bait to lure sharks to chase them, while another person, armed with a sharp fork, accurately targets the shark's vital parts and leaps into the sea to stab it fiercely. It was only nine years ago that sharks were recognized as a raw material for making cod liver oil. The United States is now more developed in this industry than any other country.

### Miniature News

Wuxi

[Our Dispatch] Zhang Yifei, the former county magistrate and head of the social affairs section of this county, and six others, are suspected of participating in the "Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary Alliance" organization. After being arrested and sent to the provincial capital, Peng Fuzhong and two others were deemed not suspicious and have been released back to Wuxi. Xue Mingjian and Sun Xiangfeng, members of the Legislative Yuan from Wuxi, have sent a letter to Premier He of the Executive Yuan, requesting that the Jinghu Garrison Headquarters be ordered to transfer the case to the judiciary for handling as soon as possible to uphold the protection of human rights, as the case has not been publicly processed.

[Another Dispatch] The Jiangsu Province Tenant Welfare Association held its first representative assembly in this city on the 17th. Twenty-five representatives from various counties including Zhenjiang, Yixing, Suzhou, Yuyao, Songjiang, Wuxi, and Changzhou attended. The chairman, Ge Jianshi, first reported that the Jiangsu High Court had issued a ruling to abolish the issue of using rice as rent.

Beiqiao

[Our Dispatch] For the 37th year of the Republic, Shanghai County failed to pay the land tax. The surcharge has now been adjusted to 144,000 yuan per shi (unit of volume) of rice. The back taxes for the 35th and 36th years will also be converted at the new price.

### Introducing the Medical Aid Society for Acute Illnesses (3)

Answering Reader Inquiries and Requesting Enthusiastic Donations from Caring Individuals

(4) Application Procedures

If a citizen suddenly suffers from one of the acute illnesses listed above, they can be directly taken to the society's designated hospitals for treatment. If, after diagnosis, it is deemed necessary to provide emergency treatment and the case meets the society's regulations, the hospital should provide treatment regardless of whether the patient's family is able to afford the treatment costs. Therefore, the patient's family can, upon admission, ask the hospital to fill out the society's printed form within the prescribed time limit of 24 hours and notify the society by phone. Whether applying for aid or applying for a guarantee, the same procedure must be followed.

(5) Aid Levels

The level of aid is determined by the society based on the patient's actual circumstances. If the family is impoverished and truly unable to pay, full aid will be provided. If they are able to afford part of the cost, the society will provide partial aid to supplement the shortfall. If the patient's family does not wish to accept aid but only a temporary loan, the society also has loan provisions. No interest is charged on the loan, and it can be paid in installments.

### National Banks Unrestrictedly Selling Gold Off-Market, Gold Prices Fluctuating Between Solid and Flat Yesterday, On-Market Trading Disconnected from Off-Market, Unable to Conduct Business

[Our Dispatch] The gold market was calm yesterday, with prices fluctuating between solid and flat. On-market trading remained stagnant, still stuck at the 8.71 million upper limit as usual. Off-market spot trading was subdued due to heavy pressure from the Central Bank, with large dealers remaining inactive and buying interest tepid. Entrusted to Da Desheng and Zhao Fengchang Gold Shops, trading opened with a restrictive sale at 12.8 million, but due to lack of interest, prices were dropped to 12.2 million, selling approximately 200 bars, stabilizing sentiment. The morning opened flat, at 11.8 million and 12.3 million, reaching as high as 12.4 million and 12.7 million. Near noon, due to high after-hours interest rates and continued large-scale reverse flow of Hong Kong gold, supply was ample. Fearing the financial reform plan, various parties frequently sold, dropping to 11.7 million and 12 million at the noon close. In the afternoon, due to overnight trading, interest rates increased by 200 to 250 yuan, opening at 14.5 million and 15 million, reaching as high as 14.7 million and 15 million. Midway, the Central Bank continued to sell gold in large quantities at 14.8 million, dropping to 14.5 million, with few buyers, only selling a dozen or so bars, gradually dropping to 14.3 million and 14.6 million, eventually closing at 14.4 million and 14.7 million in the evening. As a result, prices fell back by 100,000 compared to the previous day.

Off-market futures trading opened in the morning at 13 million and 13.5 million, reaching as high as 13.9 million and 14.2 million, dropping to as low as 12.7 million and 13.2 million, closing at 13.3 million and 13.6 million at noon. In the afternoon, intraday trading opened at 13 million and 13.5 million, reaching as high as 13.3 million and 13.6 million, dropping to as low as 12.7 million and 13 million, eventually closing at 13 million and 13.3 million, rebounding by 2.6 million compared to the previous day. Interest rates for overnight long and short positions opened low by 20 yuan, at 260 yuan and 280 yuan, with the settlement price for the difference money at 16 million.

[Our Dispatch] The gold market, which opened not long ago, has seen an increasingly wide gap between on-market and off-market prices in recent days due to the constraint of a 20% upper limit on on-market price increases. Furthermore, with high after-hours interest rates, a 20% daily increase limit only equates to a daily interest rate of 200 yuan, making an upper limit an inevitable trend. As a result, the market has been stagnant for nearly a week. The Central Bank has currently agreed to improve market rules, but the Ministry of Finance has not yet issued approval, so on-market trading exists in name only.

Recently, various parties have expressed suspicion regarding the Central Bank's large-scale gold sales off-market through Da Desheng and Zhao Fengchang Gold Shops. This reporter specifically inquired about this matter with the person in charge of Zhao Fengchang Gold Shop. The shop and Da Desheng act as agents for the Central Bank's gold sales. The Central Bank has a permanent supervisor every day who handles the matter together. Regarding prices, they consult with the Central Bank's Operations Bureau at any time, reporting sales as they occur, with absolutely no irregularities, and only taking a commission of one-thousandth, he said.

### The Shorts Launch a Counterattack, the Bullish Sentiment on Chinese Stocks Has Subsided

Due to the sudden dimming of hopes for peace talks, the bullish trend in Chinese stocks over the past few days has gradually subsided. Moreover, Ye Zhong's tight monetary policy has not eased, with after-hours interest rates at approximately 1 yuan per 1,000 yuan, making it difficult to borrow money, and sentiment has weakened. Large "short" sellers seized the opportunity to resist pressure, so the morning market was difficult to stabilize, and the afternoon market showed weakness.

Yong Yarn opened high at 120 yuan, once reaching as high as 123 yuan after opening, but it was short-lived and soon returned to a downward trend, hovering for about an hour. It repeatedly showed signs of fatigue and rising, but was still suppressed by the strong force of the shorts. At 11:30, interest rates were released, reaching as high as 135 yuan and 145 yuan, and sentiment suddenly became weak. Large dealer No. 13 took the lead in initiating selling, and Nos. 135, 145, and 169 also collectively followed, with the market retreating in a straight line, reaching as low as 106 yuan. Near the close, No. 13 covered shorts and went long, pulling the price up to close at 111 yuan. The government gold bonds reached the upper limit, seeing the highest price of 4,177,200 yuan. The remaining stock markets all showed a trend of solid at first but then weak.

### Foreign Stocks Reaching Repeated Peaks

Foreign stocks reached repeated peaks. Yesterday, the market saw new highs, with Ewo Yarns bought at 270,000 and sold at 290,000, a gain of 35,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

British American Tobacco was bought at 310,000 and sold at 330,000, a rise of 50,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Ewo Brewery was bought at 50,000 and sold at 53,000, a gain of 4,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Yip Kee was bought unilaterally at 90,000, matching the buying price from the previous day. Steel Corporation was bought at 49,000 and sold at 52,000, a rise of 4,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

China Paper Board was sold for 70,000, a rise of 21,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Asia Navigation was bought at 29,000 and sold at 30,000. Wheelock Marden broke through the million-yuan mark, trading at 1.1 million for buying and 1.3 million for selling, an increase of 100,000 yuan.

### Silver Dollar Market Firm

[Our Dispatch] The US dollar off-market trend hardened yesterday. Due to the sharp price increase in Hong Kong, various gangs searched fiercely, already diverging from the Big Head dollars. The morning opened at 250,000 and 260,000, reaching as high as 260,000 and 270,000, closing at 245,000 and 255,000 at noon. In the afternoon, due to overnight trading, interest rates increased by 200 to 250 yuan, opening at 290,000 and 300,000, a surge of more than 50,000 compared to the previous day. In barter transactions, 9.5 yuan in US dollars exchanged for 10 yuan in Big Head dollars.

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, silver dollar arbitrage gradually became more active. Four or five Tianjin gangs were doing it, mostly for tea payments, arbitraging out approximately 150,000 yuan, with an exchange rate of 3 yuan per 100 yuan. Qingdao also arbitraged out silver dollar remittances, with payment in cash two days after sight, an exchange rate of 6 yuan per 100 yuan. Hankou arbitraged out more than 400,000 yuan, with a premium of 5 to 8 yuan per 100 yuan. Wanxian arbitrage for Yuan silver dollars rose by 2 yuan, with delivery in Shanghai on a ten-day term, paying in cash, with transaction amounts ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 yuan. Guiyang Yuan silver dollars were arbitraged out with a premium of 15 to 18 yuan per 100 yuan. Shanghai gangs were doing it, with small but numerous transactions, totaling about 40,000 yuan. There was no arbitrage for Yuan silver dollars in Peiping, only heard of a 500 US dollar bill being arbitraged out, with a high exchange rate of 8 yuan per 100 yuan. Jiangxi gangs arbitraged out Big Head dollars in seven transactions, also with a premium, ranging from 1 to 2 yuan, because prices are low in that area, but most are remittances from local product merchants, with very small amounts. Rice gangs did not have funds for arbitrage. Several trades were arbitraged out in Changsha by Hunan gangs, with very large amounts, said to be funds for special local products, with the × Department purchasing materials totaling a huge sum of 380,000 yuan. Apart from some cash already shipped to Shanghai, most of it was paid in gold yuan at the day's price. After inquiries from reporters in various places, the method of arbitrage and the exchange rate were kept strictly confidential.

Street trading fluctuated narrowly. In the morning, because the Central Bank's gold and silver exchange rate remained unchanged, still one tael of gold for 52 Big Head dollars, the outflow of funds in recent days was quite large, and sentiment was stable. Big Head dollars were priced from 220,000 and 235,000, stagnating to 15,000. In the afternoon, the asking price remained at 220,000 and 235,000. Small Head dollars were quoted at 175,000 and 190,000. Eagle silver dollars were quoted at 130,000 and 150,000. For promissory note trading, Big Head dollars were quoted at 230,000 and 240,000, for overnight delivery. Money exchanges did Big Head dollars as high as 260,000 and 280,000, with few transactions, slightly increasing by 10,000 to 20,000 compared to the previous day.

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday at the Stock Exchange Building, the gold and silver exchange ratio did not see much gain or loss. In the morning, Big Head dollars initially traded at 47 and 50, dropping near noon to 46 and 49, and in the afternoon remained at 47 and 50. Small Head dollars traded at 58 and 61. Eagle silver dollars were not traded.

### Central Mint Casting Ship Dollars Daily

Since the Central Mint began minting silver dollars, production has gradually increased. It now mints 200,000 Ship Dollars daily, and can increase to 500,000 in the short term. According to factory director Zhang, who spoke to the Huadong News Agency yesterday: (1) The Central Bank recently ordered 1.2 million ounces of silver from the UK, which has already arrived and is being used to mint Ship Dollars. (2) The Central Bank has previously collected a lot of mixed silver dollars, all of which will continue to be reminted into Ship Dollars. Another 3.6 million mixed silver dollars arrived last Saturday. (It is said that this batch of mixed silver dollars was mostly shipped from Australia.) (3) The Central Mint still has several minting machines in Guangzhou and Kunming, which will be shipped to Shanghai. After they arrive, the daily minting volume can be increased to 500,000. (4) In addition to minting silver dollars, the factory continues to mint ten-tael gold bars.

### Details of Value-Preserving Deposits Finalized

[Our Dispatch] After the Legislative Yuan passed the principle of value-preserving deposits of the Ministry of Finance, Minister Liu brought it to Shanghai the other day. Yesterday, the heads of various national banks and treasuries met to discuss the implementation details. As a result, all the details have been finalized and will be taken by Minister Liu to the capital. Once the Legislative Yuan passes it, it will be issued by the Executive Yuan for implementation.

In addition: It is reported that the certificates for value-preserving deposits in the National Treasury are currently being printed by the National Bank. They are of a unified design and, once ready, will be jointly organized by the National Bank and treasury in Shanghai. The interest rate will be set at a minimum of 3% and a maximum of 1%. The handling fee charged by the banks and treasuries is proposed to be 2 per thousand and will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval.

### Price Limits Further Relaxed Yesterday, Rice Market Trading Gradually Returning to Normal

The price limit for rice was further relaxed to 1.3 million yesterday, and market trading has returned to normal. Due to tight credit, all goods are flat, sentiment is stable, and all goods can be traded within the price limit. Rice shops are weak because of tight credit and poor appetite.

Since the early and late japonica rice markets both opened at the price limit, the price of secondary goods was slightly reduced, with 1.28 million and 1.25 million for early rice. The total arrival of rice in the two rice markets was 2,443 stones.

The edible oil market was stable. Due to tight credit, many households were selling, and scattered households were unable to withstand high interest rates, so prices had little fluctuation. Soybean oil opened at 7.9 million, reaching a maximum of 8.1 million, and closed at 8 million, slightly rising by 200,000 to 300,000. Raw vegetable oil closed at 7 million, and Jiton raw oil closed at 7.7 million, an increase of 700,000 compared to the previous closing price. Small cart sesame oil opened at 760,000 yuan. Soybean cakes were scarce and prices were firm, rising by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan.

The rising trend of flour, which had previously subsided slightly, was reignited yesterday. The reason was that news of interest rate purchases spread, and scattered households strongly absorbed it, and holders took the opportunity to raise prices. Although credit was tight, sentiment remained high, and the market stood out by rising more than 20% amidst the stabilization of the prices of hundreds of goods.

Old car brand opened at 495,000 yuan in the morning, gradually rising in the mid-market, and the closing price created a new high of 560,000. The Army Ship brand temporarily rose to 530,000 near the close. After the close, holders took the opportunity to sell at a high price, and returned to the 500,000 mark. Bran was raised by 10%, and Dafeng brand was priced at 428,000 yuan for large packages.

The prices in the miscellaneous grains market varied. Soybeans were still performing well, and market prices were firm. Soybean paste was priced at 1.25 million, and Car beans were quoted at 1.2 million yuan. Corn was firm at first and then weak. Raw peanuts were extremely sluggish in sales, falling back by 200,000 yuan. Raw peanuts from Linhuai Pass retreated to the 3 million mark. Sesame trading remained scarce, and red sorghum showed a slight downward trend.

### Cotton Yarn Fluctuating Unsteadily, Narrow Price Movements in the Market

Cotton yarn continued to trend higher. Because market financing was expensive, holders had to add financing costs when selling. The market fluctuated little yesterday. Most prices outside the exchange were stable, and sentiment was also stabilizing. As a result, the increase in the price of each yarn was only enough for one day's interest.

42-count Blue Phoenix went all the way from 78 million to a high of 83 million, closing at the 8 million mark, an increase of 13 million compared to the previous day. 32-count Silver Moon rose by 9 million, ending at 53 million.

21-count Double Horse spot goods immediately soared through the mark upon opening, creating a new high of 41 million, once surging to 44.5 million, and finally falling back to 43 million, an increase of 9 million. 20-count Double Horse approached 40 million, an increase of 20% to 25%.

Yesterday, the cloth market moved narrowly. In the morning, prices opened low due to the still tight money market. Afterwards, buying on dips was still enthusiastic, and the market then returned to a firm state. As a result, the market showed only slight differences compared to the previous day.

Dragon Head Fine Cloth retreated from 1.42 million to 1.39 million. Near noon, customers frequently bought, creating a new high of 1.51 million. Near the close, there were gains and profit-taking sales, and the market showed a slight decline, finally closing at 1.45 million, a fall of 20,000.

Four Gentlemen Twill opened at 1.32 million, briefly falling to 1.28 million, reaching a high of 1.41 million mid-session, and finally closing at 1.38 million, a drop of 40,000.

The remaining cloths generally fell. Only Jumping Carp Yuan Guang Twill rose by 70,000. In the afternoon, the dragon head was at 1.65 million, and the Four Gentlemen Twill was at 1.6 million. There was some progress in the middle session, but in the end they fell back again, closing at 1.62 million and 1.59 million respectively in the evening.

### Sugar Buying Interest Undiminished

The sugar market saw tight money among operators yesterday, with after-hours interest rates as high as 200 to 250 yuan. However, since buying interest had not waned, prices still rose significantly. No. 24 raw sugar was at 1.68 million in the morning, with a high of 1.86 million, a low of 1.76 million, and closed at 1.84 million at noon, rising by 30-20,000 yuan compared to yesterday. The factory's rock sugar was at 2.6 million, rising by 300,000 compared to the previous day. Zhenji sliced rock sugar was at 3.5 million yuan, rising by 700,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

### National Banks Temporarily Suspending the Gold-for-Silver Dollar Exchange Starting Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] The Central Bank's method of exchanging gold for Yuan Big Head silver dollars was temporarily suspended yesterday, so the announcement of the ratio of gold to Yuan Big Head silver dollars was stopped yesterday.

According to the authorities, the method of exchanging gold for silver dollars was originally a temporary expedient measure to facilitate the payment of salaries to various industrial and commercial sectors. Therefore, the exchange must be done through the mediation of members of silver houses and gold guilds, proving that it is for the purpose of paying salaries. Now that the period for paying salaries in the middle of the month has passed, the method of exchanging has also been temporarily suspended.

### Feather King Ferryman Meets a Formidable Opponent; Huang Defu Delivers a Stunning Performance; Close Scores and Intense Competition as Seen Only in the Danish Open; The Malaysian-Chinese Doubles Remain Unmatched in the World

[Reuters, Copenhagen, 18th] The Danish International Badminton Championships concluded today after five days of intense competition. Ferryman of the United States won the singles title. Malaysian-Chinese champion Huang Defu lost to Ferryman in a three-game bloodbath, with scores of 15-11, 14-17, and 17-15. This was the most intense battle Ferryman had ever experienced. According to Danish experts, this match was likely the most exciting of all European competitions. Ferryman told reporters after the match that the Malaysian-Chinese player might defeat him after a few more matches. Ferryman's weaknesses have been discovered by the Malaysian-Chinese players, who are beginning to attack them. His forehand smash is the weakest, and his arm and leg length give him an advantage over the shorter Malaysian-Chinese players. Ferryman had defeated Huang Defu twice before, once in the Thomas Cup and once in the British Championships. In today's first game, Ferryman took an early lead of 3-0, then 4-3. Huang caught up at 6-5, but Ferryman scored six consecutive points to lead 11-6. Huang fought back to 12-11, but Ferryman scored three more points to win the first game 15-11. The second game was a hard-fought battle. Huang took an early lead of 2-1, but Ferryman came on strong, quickly reaching 12-3. Huang scored eight consecutive points to catch up at 12-11 and then tied at 13-13. Huang won the second game 17-14. In the third game, Ferryman took a strong lead of 6-0, but Huang rallied and scored five consecutive points. Ferryman then led 14-11, but Huang tied again at 14-14. Ferryman finally won the final game 17-15.

In the doubles final, an all-Malaysian-Chinese affair, Huang Defu and Zhang Chengkun defeated Zeng Guanliang and Yang Decai 15-7, 18-16.

In the women's singles final, Tonny Ahm of Denmark defeated Sonja Rasmussen, also of Denmark, 11-4, 11-3.

In the women's doubles final, the Danish women took the title, with Tonny Ahm and Sonja Rasmussen defeating Skovgaard and Nielsen 15-8, 15-1.

In the mixed doubles final, Zeng Guanliang of Malaysia-China and Tonny Ahm defeated Martensen and Sonja Rasmussen 9-15, 15-12, 15-2.

### Da Gong Challenges McKinley; Exciting Basketball Tonight

The Shanghai Sports Reporters Association, recognizing that the Da Gong basketball team had not made a public appearance since its victorious expedition to Southeast Asia (including ports in the Philippines) last year, secured sponsorship from the Municipal Committee to invite the team to perform against the U.S. Navy's Third McKinley team. The game will be held at the Municipal Gymnasium at 7:00 PM tonight. Before the main event, starting at 5:15 PM, there will be two additional matches: first, the Women's Ya Team against the Li Team, followed by John's Team against Da Tong. Tickets will be sold for 10,000 upstairs, 20,000 downstairs, and 40,000 for reserved seats inside the court. To prevent overcrowding, tickets will be pre-sold starting at 1:00 PM this afternoon, and the doors will open at 4:00 PM. Long-term passes will be valid as usual, but player IDs will not be accepted. The Siwei Boy Scouts will be present to maintain order. The schedule for the three events is listed below:

Ya Team – Li Team (Women) 5:15 PM

John – Da Tong (Men) 6:00 PM

Da Gong – McKinley (Men) 7:00 PM

The Ya Team is making its debut performance since its formation. All the female players are seasoned veterans, including Zhu Jiazhen, Huang Ruyu, Sun Fengzhu, Qian Mengyue, and Wang Zhelun, known for their experience and fame throughout the league. Wang Shan, Zhu Min, Wu Zhaorui, and Zhu Lanzhen are representatives of the city's National Games team and are particularly skilled. Therefore, the entire team has excellent offense and defense and a strong lineup. The Li Team has participated in the league's women's division for three years. Although they are ranked at the bottom, they have been persistent. In the recent Mayor's Cup, they only lost by ten points to the Li Team, showing significant improvement. They are expected to put up a good fight against Ya.

Following the women's game, there will be a match between the two major university teams, John and Da Tong. Since the conclusion of the university and college basketball tournament, school team matches have been rare. John has been a dominant force in university basketball for years, boasting five top players from Group A: Sun Guozheng, Tao Yingshi, Huang Tianlie, Sun Moses, and Hu Huizhao, known for their bravery, skillful defense, and superior technique. Da Tong has the three musketeers, Xu Zhongsi, Le Jiazhou, and Li Hanting, renowned players from the Hua Lian and Ren Yu teams in Group A1, known for their excellent skills and refined technique. Other players, such as Dong Qiwen, are also accomplished players, making the outcome uncertain.

The main event will be Da Gong against McKinley. Da Gong toured Malaya, Singapore, Manila, Hong Kong, and other places last year, playing forty games, winning thirty-four, drawing three, and losing three, achieving remarkable results and making a name for themselves. Team captain Cai Wenhua, vice-captain Tu Wenlong, and National Games athlete Cai Zhongqi each possess unique skills. Huang Bailing, Zhan Chen, Wang Cunzhong, and Ye Yunshan are also agile players. Since returning last month, they have been training hard and are full of energy. Today is their first official appearance, and they are expected to deliver an exciting and intense performance.

McKinley was transferred to Shanghai from Qingdao and has participated in numerous league and friendly matches, achieving considerable success. In the Mayor's Cup, they originally faced the Police Machine Team, but the latter withdrew. They then played a friendly match against the Green Forest Team, which was a closely contested battle. The game went into overtime twice without a winner, demonstrating the team's strength. It is expected that they will bring out their best players for tonight's game and fight tooth and nail, promising a thrilling and intense match.

In the 4th Table Tennis League, Lianxing of Group A faced Silk White at the Silk Industry Hall the night before last at 8:00 PM, with over 300 spectators in attendance. Lianxing, mindful of Qinglian's defeat to Silk White, fielded its strongest lineup and did not dare to be careless. Hu Zuochang, Hu Yiping, and Feng Hao in particular, with their fierce smashes, were unstoppable. In the Silk White team, Zhu Jiang and Yang Changxi fought hard against Chen Xingquan. The two fought fiercely for three games, but Xingquan's defense proved too much for Changxi, who lost 1-2. In the final match, Zhang Shanda of Lianxing played carelessly, while Silk White veteran Weng Shuheng doubled his efforts and easily defeated Zhang Shanda in straight sets, breaking Silk White's egg record. As a result, Lianxing defeated Silk White 4-1. The remaining matches were Group B matches, which took place in various halls. The results of all seven matches were as expected, except for Youlian, a team of rising stars, which suffered a crushing 2-3 defeat at the hands of Xin Yun Fansheng, a major upset.

### Table Tennis Must-Knows

— Gong Xinmao, Edited by Chen Linsheng

(9) Basic Table Tennis Practice

The above explained that playing table tennis should start with practicing "close blocking." When practicing, attention should be paid to controlling the height and direction. Controlling the height and direction is the most basic practice for playing table tennis. After practicing these two techniques, it is easy to practice other techniques. If these two techniques are not mastered, imitating the posture and methods of famous players will only lead to superficiality and wasted effort.

Controlling the height, except for people who are learning table tennis, because they are not familiar with various movements, the balls they hit often cannot be controlled as desired. This is a stage that must be gone through. Diligent practice will lead to faster progress, and a considerable understanding of the theoretical methods will lead to even faster progress. Some people, although they have achieved considerable success in playing table tennis, can only understand the balls they hit intuitively and cannot know the reason why. This is because they have not deeply studied the theory. The method of controlling the height of the table tennis ball when hitting it is a basic skill. The reasons why the table tennis ball is hit high or low are roughly no more than the following points:

The Relationship between the Player and the Distance to the Ball When the ball is coming and going, if you are far away from the table and the ball is very close to the net, and the momentum of the ball is very weak, it is too late to reach forward to receive it. You have to stretch your arm as far as possible to make up for it, and the racket becomes flatter, and the ball hit will be higher. If you are very close to the table, the ball you hit is in the middle of the swing, and the height of the ball will be very appropriate. Even if you want the ball to be very high or very low, it will be very easy, unlike being far away from the table where you have the will but not the strength. Why does the flatter the racket, the higher the ball hit? This is entirely due to the angle formed between the table tennis racket and the ball. The smaller the angle, the lower the ball hit, and the larger the angle, the higher the ball hit.

Three American female basketball national team players, all over five feet ten inches tall

### Three Outstanding American Female Basketball Players

[Special Report from this Newspaper] Yalian Pengsi, Tao Lisi Huisi, and He An Boleda are the three forwards of the U.S. Women's Amateur Basketball Team. They are also the mainstays of the American women's basketball champion Blue Team. Since 1942, the Blue Team has been a leader in the basketball world. Last season, they were invincible in forty games, large and small.

These three female players, who make up the Blue Team's invincible frontline, are all taller than our country's male players.

Yalian Pengsi (see the photo on the left, with six stars on her shorts) is the captain of the Blue Team and the All-American Team. This 26-year-old redhead is five feet eleven inches tall and weighs 150 pounds. Since graduating from middle school in 1938, she has participated in more than ten teams and has always been elected as the captain. Since being selected as an All-American representative in 1940, she has always been on the list, and this year is her ninth selection. Ms. Pengsi's basketball skills are amazing, and she has the superb skill of hitting the basket with both her left and right hands. Last season, in the final against a certain team, Pengsi injured her right arm the day before, but she still勉力出場. As a result, she scored 33 points with her left hand alone, defeating a strong opponent. Pengsi is also humble and treats her teammates like sisters and cares for the injured and young like a慈母. In non-important battles, she often steps aside to give younger players a chance to play. However, last season she still scored 596 points alone.

Taolisi Huisi, 25 years old, five feet ten inches tall. She is a versatile player who can attack and defend. Her style is fierce, and when she plays defense, she often makes the enemy forwards shrink back. The golden-haired Wins is also often proud of this. Off the court, Wins treats people kindly and is a secretary at an Atlantic City oil company.

"Leopard Girl" An Boleda, has the same height as Huisi and weighs 54 pounds. "Leopard Girl" is a 23-year-old, pampered daughter of a wealthy family. In addition to playing basketball, she spends all day driving around on the highway; at night, she likes to show off another set of floor skills - London dance and sailor dance. "Leopard Girl" also loves to play baseball and is a first baseman for the Lexington men's baseball team (Xiaoxing).

### Don't "Assume"

— Thunder

"Assume" is not a scary word in itself. Because it not only contains a big question mark, but also has great flexibility - it can be so, but not necessarily so; it also leaves people with a glimmer of hope that "it is not so."

However, now, assuming is a terrible word. Its threatening power is no less than adjusting prices instead of raising them, and the long string of circles behind the numbers. Because now's "assumption," at the time of assuming, does still leave people with a bit of hope that maybe it won't be so; but in fact, when the fact of the price increase is announced, the so-called "assumption" is often after the fact. The beautiful anticipation is all shattered.

For example: the cost of living index for the first half of March was more than 1,300 times; the assumed index for public utilities in late March was more than 2,200 times; the "assumed" price increase was slightly less than 70 percent. However, the cost of living index for the second half of March was more than 3,600 times, an actual increase of slightly less than 180 percent. The expression of this fact is equivalent to telling the citizens publicly that this "assumption" is still the lowest estimate. If you are not an idiot, you should look "up." Therefore, as soon as the "assumption" is "certain," everything first lines up to increase prices!

For another example, the assumed index for public utilities announced on April 8 was more than 6,900 times, an increase of more than 90 percent compared to the index of more than 3,600 times. If we still follow the example of last month, then our cost of living index for the first half of April should be at least more than 11,000 times. But this is not "assumed."

Because the "Committee on Suggestions for Solving the Cash Shortage" used 10,000 times as the "assumption" for the cost of living index for the first period of this month when meeting on the 11th to raise cash to pay workers' salaries. From this point of view, it was known early on that "unfortunately, it will be hit."

Of course, the index is determined based on the rise and fall of prices, and its sharp rise is not its own crime. The "assumed index" is the same, it is just an "assumption" in the transition between the old and new indexes, and it does not have its own crime.

However, I always feel that the publication of the cost of living index twice a month is already enough to make people panic. Now, two more "assumed indexes" have been added out of thin air, which really gives people the feeling of a leaky house being hit by continuous rain. Because as soon as the "assumption" is "certain," although it is not really "certain," everything will increase in price, which is always the case.

The common people are already so overwhelmed by life that they can't breathe. Can the authorities have a little kindness, cancel this "assumption," and reduce a little suffering for the citizens?

### Some Thoughts

— Awakener

Successful revolutionaries are called "heroes," but unsuccessful ones are often called "traitors." Everyone says that money is the root of all evil, but no one is willing to give their money away to others for nothing.

"Science benefits mankind," many people echo. But they don't realize that weapons of mass destruction like bombs and cannons are also products of science.

Some say: "Life is like a dream." Then isn't hope a "dream within a dream"?

What makes people worried is "desire," and what makes people excited is also "desire."

Passing a birthday means getting closer to the grave; from this point of view, birthdays are not only not worth celebrating, but are actually very worth grieving.

The purpose of life seems to be just to tear off dozens of calendars.

### Discussing Improving the Index

— Li Jie

Since Li, the adoption of the cost of living index to calculate wages has indeed reduced a lot of trouble for Shanghai society, especially in labor-management disputes. The index is something that has made undeniable contributions over the years. However, in the past one or two months, due to the sharp devaluation of the Gold Yuan, prices have risen by 50 percent or even doubled every day, causing the salaries calculated based on the cost of living index to be greatly out of touch with actual needs, leaving workers in a state of helplessness and living from hand to mouth. At this point, the index issue seems to need to be reconsidered and improved.

The numbers of the cost of living index themselves are absolutely scientific. Moreover, in terms of its calculation method, it is also very accurate. Some people see that the cost of living index is out of touch with real prices and suspect that there must be bargaining in the semi-monthly index review meeting to discount the real index by 30 percent or 20 percent. I don't believe this. Because if the authorities want to play tricks, they can do it during the investigation, why be so foolish as to discount it after the index is calculated, so as to give people something to grab? The cost of living index itself is not flawed; so where is the flaw? In the number of investigations.

The index was originally a general record of prices in the past half month. But today, because workers and salary earners who are paid according to the index use the index published in the first half of the month to convert salaries and live through the future days of the second half of the month. So this "historical record" seems to have become a "prior standard." The cost of living index is investigated several times every half month. When prices are relatively stable, the first and last investigations are not much different, so the average number is naturally similar; but when prices rise sharply, the situation is very different. For example, in half a month, the first investigation shows that the price of rice is one million yuan per stone, the second investigation is 1.4 million yuan, the third investigation is 1.8 million yuan, and the fourth investigation is 2.4 million yuan. The average of the four times, that is, the average price of rice in the first half of the month, is 1.65 million yuan. This fourth investigation was on the 29th, the day before the cost of living index was published. By the time the index is published and the money is received, it is already the 1st at the earliest. After two days, the price of rice has risen to 2.8 million yuan. Where can you buy a stone of rice with this average number? You can only buy five or six斗!

From this, it can be seen that when prices fluctuate sharply, the method of using averages is absolutely not feasible. Because the wages or salaries received by workers and staff are intended to cover the cost of living after the index is published, and they cannot go back a few days to buy rice at a price of 1.6 million yuan per stone. Therefore, the index should naturally be based on prices closer to the date of publication, and it should also be more reasonable.

Today, I saw in the newspaper that the General Labor Union has asked the authorities to change the method. I don't know if the General Labor Union has already proposed a method. I think that to solve the urgent problem, it is only necessary to cancel the first few investigations in each half month and change to investigating only once per period, that is, on the 14th and 29th of each month (the big month is thirty days), and announce it immediately the next day. In this way, the index and prices will not be too far out of touch. (Editor's note: It has now been decided to change to a weekly salary system.)

### Contributing Financial Reform Ideas

— Keyun

Recently, several gentlemen of the financial authorities, although very adept at business tactics, buying high and selling low, using gold to make money, I fear it will still be of no avail to the empty national treasury. I, as a member of the people, after much thought, have come up with a few solutions, which I hereby offer to the financial authorities. If adopted, I guarantee they will make money, enrich the country, and replenish the treasury with ease. I respectfully present them as follows:

Firstly, one might follow the previous method of adding value to postage stamps by imprinting the recovered legal tender and small-denomination gold yuan notes with the words "Temporarily used as × ten thousand gold yuan." This would, of course, save a significant amount of printing costs and a large quantity of fine paper. As for the worn-out condition of the banknotes, that would not matter. Just issue a clear announcement: that none of the issued banknotes will be recalled. Since the banknotes are already worn out and have passed through the hands of many people, once they become unusable, they can only be burned or thrown into the trash, naturally preventing further currency inflation. When the supply of discarded banknotes is exhausted, domestically produced Lian Shi paper or Mao Bian paper, etc., can be used for printing, with the same effect. This would be even more beneficial for promoting the increased production of domestic paper.

Secondly, the current method of selling gold is not thorough enough. It seems one could select a day and sell all the gold bars at half the market price, completely selling them out. If the people do not have enough cash, they can convert real estate or silver dollars into gold yuan notes, which will be accepted in the same way. The public will naturally flock to it. However, one thing must be noted: the addresses of the purchasers must be recorded. A few hours after the sale, suddenly issue an emergency order announcing that gold is nationalized. Anyway, the addresses of the purchasers are readily available. Immediately mobilize a large number of people to track them down and confiscate the original items. In this way, gold yuan notes that have been released can be recovered out of thin air, and real estate and silver dollars, etc., can be earned. After a few days, announce that the people can hold gold again. Repeat this method again and again, and of course, great profits will be made.

Thirdly, announce that the salaries of government employees, educators, and soldiers will be calculated in full according to the local cost of living index, and their base salaries will be increased. However, only a small portion is paid in cash, and the majority is paid in "national treasury stock." After a few rounds, when the stock is exhausted, a capital increase can be implemented, requiring each share to be subscribed for with several shares. If people are willing to subscribe, more currency can be recovered; if they cannot subscribe, the stock will be declared invalid, and the "board of directors" will be responsible for raising the shortfall, which can then be issued later. In this way, there will be no worry about being unable to pay salaries.

The above three points, whether one or all are adopted, can greatly help the finances. However, it would be best to ask medical or chemical professionals to invent a kind of anesthetic drug to be dispersed in the air, so that the people of the whole country are numb, making it naturally easier to implement these measures.

### The Magic Weapon is Broken Again

— Xiumu

### Government Employees and Educators

— Xianweisheng

I, the writer, resent my parents for making me study, which has condemned me to a life within the "government employees and educators" realm. I have been working in administrative agencies for a full ten years; in educational institutions, even longer. No matter how I try, I have never been able to escape this "golden cage."

Because of this, my life is over. Therefore, whenever I hear the words "government employees and educators," I simply get a headache.

Some people say: "Government" is "government employees," and "education" is "teachers." They cannot be lumped together, not to mention the distinction between "provincial" and "county" levels. For example, every time salaries are adjusted, those at the provincial level are so direct and swift, the money is in their hands; while those at the county level can take a good nap and wait.

Some people also say: Not only that, but there are even more mysteries in this. Even after salaries are issued according to the salary standards, there are different experiences. For example, if you and the accounting clerk are from the same hometown, or you were brought in by a superior, then it is easier to borrow salary during lean times; otherwise, there is no need to even ask.

In short, the most unfortunate ones are, of course, those in "education," especially those in "county-level education," who have the least chance of survival. For example, recently, municipal teachers in Shanghai received 2700 times their salary, but in our noble county - Taicang, since the beginning of the school year, not even one times salary has been issued. To make matters worse, the authorities, with their quick minds, launched a "raising temporary education funds" campaign at the beginning of the school year, with elementary school teachers receiving three to five dou of rice, barely enough to survive until now. But it's like a drop in the bucket, even if all the funds are used, each person still receives less than the "bowing salary," - so how can I not resent my parents!

### Two Post-War Japanese Matters

— Yanling

Madame Butterfly

The famous Japanese actress Michi Sunahara has been invited by the Teatro Colón in Argentina, South America, this spring to perform in the opera "Madame Butterfly." This is the first time a Japanese actress has appeared on an international stage since the war. When Sunahara received the invitation, she told reporters, "I would be lonely going alone. If I don't have a companion, I am..." When she set off, she finally took a singer named Suzuki with her.

Commemorative Holidays

Before the war, Japan had more than twenty commemorative holidays, but after the war, due to being forced to "embark on the path of democracy," some feudal commemorative holidays were gradually eliminated. Currently, there are only nine left. Namely: New Year's Day, Coming-of-Age Day, Children's Day, Emperor's Birthday, Constitution Memorial Day, Culture Day, Labor Thanksgiving Day, Vernal Equinox, and Autumnal Equinox. Holidays like Meiji Day and the Spring and Autumn Festivals at Yasukuni Shrine no longer exist.
