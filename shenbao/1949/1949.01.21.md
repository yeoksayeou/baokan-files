### Central Political Council Held an Extraordinary Meeting Yesterday: Ratified the Executive Yuan's Resolution on Peace, Discussed Representative Candidates, Modalities, and Locations, and Determined the Relocation of the Navy, Army, and Air Force Headquarters to Taiwan and Guangzhou

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The Executive Yuan's resolution on the peace issue on the 19th was presented to the Kuomintang Central Political Council at an extraordinary meeting on the morning of the 20th. Sun Ke attended and reported, and after discussion, it was resolved to ratify and approve it. The meeting was chaired by Sun Ke, who reported on the circumstances of the passage of the Executive Yuan's resolution on the 19th. Then, Wu Tiecheng, concurrently the Minister of Foreign Affairs, reported on the attitudes and contents of the replies from the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France regarding mediating the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Next, Xu Yongchang, the Minister of National Defense, reported on the enemy and our troop strengths in various war zones, as well as the defense forces and deployments in Nanjing and Shanghai. Immediately afterward, the discussion of the Executive Yuan's resolution commenced, with many committee members making speeches. Gu Zhenggang, Pan Gongzhan, Shao Hua, and Li Zonghuang, among others, expressed their opinions successively. They generally agreed with the proposal, but all believed that peace or war was the most important issue at present, and that the reform of politics, party affairs, and the military was particularly important. Although reform plans had been repeatedly proposed in the past, they lacked the spirit of vigorous implementation. Now that the policy direction of the responsible cabinet of the Executive Yuan had not yet been formulated, the essential task of reform could begin with the policy direction. As for the reform of party affairs, it could be formulated based on the policy direction. Some participants believed that reform lies in determination, and it is never too late to start reforming from tomorrow. Subsequently, relevant issues regarding peace talks, such as the selection of representatives, the modalities of negotiations, locations, and scope, were discussed in detail, but no conclusions were reached. Only the ratification of the Executive Yuan's resolution was passed. Finally, several personnel appointments and removals were approved, and the meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Wu Tiecheng, concurrently the Minister of Foreign Affairs, reported at the Kuomintang Central Political Council on the government's inquiry to the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union regarding the possibility of negotiating peace with the Chinese Communist Party and exploring the possibility of mediation by each country. At the same time, Shi Zhaoying, Director of the Information Department and spokesperson for the ministry, issued a statement at a press conference as follows: "Chairman's New Year's Day message demonstrates his determination to restore peace. In order to explain the sincerity of our government and people in restoring peace, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent identical memoranda to the governments of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union on the 8th of this month, expressing our government's willingness to hear the opinions of the governments concerned regarding our government's sincerity for peace, and willing to start peace negotiations with the Communist Party through their mediation. The four governments have now replied successively, all stating that they sincerely wish China to restore peace as soon as possible, but under the current circumstances, it is difficult to serve as mediators."

[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] The Ministry of Transportation's evacuation plan will be implemented on the 21st. Special trains, planes, and transport ships will be prepared to carry government personnel and documents to Taiwan, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, and various cities in South China. Each ministry may retain 10% or 20% of its staff to work, and they will evacuate at the last moment. The first batch of evacuees from the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will leave Nanjing on the 21st. Formal orders for the relocation of the Navy and Air Force Headquarters to Taiwan and the Army Headquarters to Guangzhou have been issued.

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 20th] The Taiwan Office of the Air Force Headquarters has now been established, with Hao Zhonghe concurrently serving as the Director.

[Our Newspaper, Nanchang, Daily] Fang Tian, upon learning of the Executive Yuan's passage of his appointment as Chairman of Jiangxi Province last night, stated that the current situation in Jiangxi is fraught with difficulties, especially in terms of funding. He also stated that he has telegraphed the Central Government to resign. Hu Jiafeng will remain in Nanjing as Deputy Secretary-General of the Presidential Office. However, when Hu spoke to the Provincial Government on the phone on the morning of the 20th, he indicated that he was still considering and would return to Jiangxi in the coming days. Hong Gui, Director of the Department of Finance, flew to Shanghai this afternoon and then to Nanjing to discuss the budget for the 38th year of the Republic (1949) in Jiangxi and how to resolve Jiangxi's financial difficulties in the future with the Ministry of Finance. According to one observer, Fang Tian's resignation is indeed his true intention. If the Central Government telegraphed him again to retain him, he might still take office, and the candidates for provincial committee members and department heads might be able to continue in their positions.

### Foreign Envoys in Nanjing Discuss the Issue of Relocating South

Washington Receives Report from the U.S. Embassy

[United Press, Washington, 19th] Under Secretary of State Lovett said: "The State Department received a telegram from the U.S. Embassy in China this morning, but the contents were not explained." When asked about the rumor that the Chinese government had requested all embassies to relocate south with them, Lovett replied that if this were the case, Ambassador Stuart would consult with other foreign envoys in China nearby, while the State Department would seek the opinions of the relevant governments. According to informed sources, foreign envoys in Nanjing have already begun discussing the matter, but it is not yet known whether the United States will accept the Chinese government's suggestion and instruct the U.S. Embassy in China to relocate south with them. Diplomatic authorities believe that the U.S. Embassy may send a portion of its staff to relocate south with them, while the rest will remain in Nanjing.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] The State Department said on the 19th that 240 Americans, including military personnel, are currently residing in Nanjing. Among them, 154 are U.S. officials and their families. If the U.S. Embassy relocates, they will also evacuate to Guangzhou, but there are some indications that at least some officials will remain there even after Nanjing falls to the Communists.

Yangzhou is Tranquil, While People in Nantong are Restless

It is rumored that the National troops are still firmly defending Lujin Town on the Grand Canal line, and the Communist bandits have not dared to enter the city. The situation in Yangzhou is very tranquil, but many non-combatant organizations have already dispersed, and wealthy citizens are moving south one after another. Prices have generally fallen for days, and the special train chartered by the banking sector to the town is ridiculously expensive at 50,000 yuan. Cinemas and theaters in the city are operating as usual, and newspapers are also being published as usual. Water and land transportation between Zhenjiang and Yangzhou is smooth, and military and political leaders are still stationed in Yangzhou, occasionally patrolling the streets, giving people extreme excitement.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 20th] As the situation in northern Jiangsu becomes tense, military and political organs, banks, and post offices in Yangzhou, Taixian, and Gaoyou have been relocating south to Zhenjiang one after another. Ships and automobiles have been requisitioned, and thousands of refugees are gathered at Liuwei. When reporters went there on the 20th, they witnessed them eating in the wind and sleeping in the dew, unable to board ships to come south, and the situation was extremely tragic. It is hoped that the shipping administration authorities will dispatch ships to rush to transport them.

[Our Newspaper, Nantong, 20th] The garrison forces in Hai'an Town on the Tongyu Line took the initiative to withdraw today, and the National troops protected the people along the way as they evacuated south. The area between Tongzhou and Rugao is still peaceful.

[Our Newspaper, Nantong, 20th] The situation in Nantong is peaceful, but the people are extremely restless, and they are moving south one after another. Various agencies have begun to disperse their families, and national banks and bureaus have suspended most of their operations due to staff shortages.

### Fierce Fighting Resumes Around Taiyuan

Bandits Launch Ferocious Attack Southwest of the City, Suffering a Miserable Defeat

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 20th] Fierce fighting has resumed around Taiyuan, which had been silent for many days. The bandits of the only brigade that was defeated by the powerful National troops in the area south of Baijiazhuang, more than 40 miles southwest of the city, gathered their remnants on the evening of the 19th to cover up their miserable defeat and launched a desperate counterattack against the highlands north of Zhuangzi and Qiugou. They launched five ferocious attacks against the highlands north of Qiugou using human wave tactics, and suffered another miserable defeat before dawn on the 20th. According to preliminary estimates, the bandits suffered more than 1,500 casualties. The bandits harassing the area south of Zhaobi Tomb and south of Songzhuang in the southeast of the city, and the area east of San'er Tree in the east of the city, were all ambushed by the National troops and fled in defeat.

### Britain Officially Denies the Claim that it is Preparing to Recognize the CCP Government: Current Far East Policy is "Wait and See"

[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] The British Foreign Office officially denied on the 19th the claim that the British government is preparing to recognize the CCP government. According to informed sources, it is too early to predict what decisions the British government will make when the CCP achieves final victory. The British government's current Far East policy is to "wait and see". The current situation is chaotic and unpredictable, and it is not yet time to make predictions.

[Central News Agency, London, 19th, United Press] It is reported that the units of the British Commonwealth agree with Britain's strict neutral attitude towards China.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Shen Changhuan, Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau, formally denied all rumors about President Chiang's movements to reporters on the 20th. Shen had just returned from the President's residence when he attended the press conference, but he was immediately troubled by telephone inquiries from various parties about the President's movements. Therefore, he made a statement on this issue at the press conference. A reporter asked when President Chiang would go to Guangzhou. Shen said: "I have never heard of any news about this matter." Shen also denied rumors that the President was traveling and that the Central Political Council was discussing the President's advance or retreat. These rumors had been spreading in the capital since 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 20th, and a few newspapers had even published extra editions based on them, which caused the citizens to feel slightly bewildered. However, these rumors were soon proven to be inaccurate. When some reporters inquired about the relationship between the Executive Yuan's statement on the 19th and the Central Political Council's discussion of the current situation on the 20th, Shen replied: "Since the President issued a New Year's Day message expressing his desire for peace, the national response has been very good. People's organizations such as provincial and municipal councils have appealed to the government and the CCP to cease fire first, and then begin peace talks. In order to comply with the wishes of the people, the Executive Yuan issued a statement on the 19th, expressing the government's willingness to immediately and unconditionally cease fire with the CCP and to appoint representatives to begin peace talks. This move fully demonstrates that the government has taken a further step towards seeking peace, and once again proves the government's sincerity in restoring peace as soon as possible. The Central Political Council meeting on the morning of the 20th discussed the current situation extensively and ratified the Executive Yuan's resolution yesterday. There were no other decisions, and all other rumors are purely false."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] President Chiang summoned Wu Tiecheng, Zheng Yanfen, Huang Shaogu, and others on the afternoon of the 20th. At 4:00 PM, he summoned Guan Linzheng. At 7:00 PM in the evening, he hosted a banquet for Navy Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing and officials above the rank of director of the Navy Headquarters to show his concern. He also scheduled to meet with Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and others on the morning of the 21st.

### The Situation in Beiping Regarding Peace or War is Confused and Uncertain: Foreign Wire Reports Say That the Outline of a Ceasefire Agreement Has Been Agreed Upon, But the Communist Army Still Fires Cold Shots into the City from Time to Time

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 4:30 PM, 20th] Ten representatives of the North China People's Peace Promotion Association went out of the city to the western suburbs of Haidian (where Yenching University is located) the day before yesterday to negotiate with the Communist side, especially on the Beiping issue, and obtained considerable results. It is reported that on the evening of their arrival in Haidian, they formally handed over to the Communist representatives the telegram from the speakers of the seven provinces and cities to Mao Zedong, appealing for cooperation with Fu Zuoyi. The Communist representatives said that they would forward it immediately. The next morning, they continued to negotiate on the ceasefire issue. The Communist side said that there had been no fighting in recent days, which was equivalent to a "truce". As for the issue of not firing "cold shots" into the city, the Communist side promised to convey it to the commanders of the Communist army units for attention. The date of the ceasefire was not definitely limited to ten days. How the Beiping peace talks would continue after the ceasefire was not discussed in detail, but many believe that there must be other ways to explore. In addition, the ten representatives elaborated on Commander-in-Chief Fu's advocacy of political democracy, economic equality, and freedom of life, as well as his diligence, hard work, integrity, and non-corruption style, which aroused much heated debate. He Siyuan spoke the most among the delegation.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 7:30 PM, 20th] There were occasional sounds of artillery in the suburbs of Beiping last night and this morning, but there was no formal contact. After the peace envoys returned from the western suburbs yesterday, they showed that local peace was proceeding through another channel. Some people working for peace are working hard on this matter, and it is not far from maturity. The atmosphere of peace or war is gradually decreasing. It is said that the demolition of civilian houses in the suburbs will be stopped, and the inspection of city gates will also be relaxed. However, the intermittent loud noises of explosions at midnight to repair the airport and remove obstacles still make it difficult for people to sleep peacefully.

[United Press, Shanghai, News, 20th] The United Press correspondent in Beiping passed through news censorship this morning and sent the following outline of the Beiping ceasefire agreement: (1) Beiping and Gui Sui are handed over to the Communist army; (2) Fu Zuoyi resigns and is succeeded by Deng Baoshan. Fu is no longer regarded as a war criminal in North China. Other generals are free to stay or leave; (3) Fu's troops are renamed the "Democratic Self-Defense Army", which is not directly commanded by the Communist army, and may eventually be disbanded; (4) The agreement will be implemented on January 20 or 21, so that the Communist army can enter Beiping in time to prepare for celebrations during the Lunar New Year.

[United Press, Beiping, 20th] The peace or destruction of Beiping reached its peak of disturbance on the 20th due to the return of the peace delegation, and rumors abounded. Although the delegation refused to formally disclose the results of its negotiations with the Communist side, individuals were free to make statements to the press, so that today's newspapers are full of various and even contradictory news, which almost makes people believe that the delegates of the delegation attended different meetings separately. One representative said: "The Communist army agreed to a ceasefire of ten days to wait for peace talks." Another representative later said: "The Communist army pointed out that Beiping is actually on ceasefire because the Communist army is not attacking the city and there are many opportunities for peace talks."

According to the statements made by the representatives and the news published in the newspapers, the situation of the peace talks should be as follows: This meeting was not the highest-level one. Communist Commander Ye Jianying and senior Communist generals did not attend. It is said that they have gone to Tianjin. Although some representatives claimed that the participants in the talks were "senior Communist army officers", one representative privately admitted that the Communist representatives who attended the meeting were only non-commissioned officers. The meeting continued until 11:00 PM, and resumed the next morning and ended at 11:00 AM. The Communist side hosted a grand banquet at the first meeting and the attitude was greatly improved at the second meeting.

It is generally believed that the Communist army participants do not have the authority to allow a ceasefire. One representative said: "The Communist army agreed to stop bombing the city." But another representative said: "The Communist side pointed out that 'in the continuation of the war, some stray bullets inside the city are inevitable'."

There were still stray bullets falling in the city on the evening of the 19th, but none on the morning of the 20th, but the sounds of machine guns from the suburbs showed that there was no full ceasefire.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Deng Wenyi, spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, declared on the 20th: "After the end of the Battle of Tianjin, the garrison troops in Tanggu have safely withdrawn to designated locations by ship. Only one battalion was lost during the withdrawal. Most of the two armies of the Tianjin garrison were lost. The bandits under Lin Biao suffered at least 65,000 casualties in the Battle of Tianjin. Now, Lin Biao has transferred four columns from Tianjin to Beiping. There are currently twelve columns of bandits in the area near Beiping."

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 20th] The suburbs of Beiping were quiet all day today. There was no contact between the two sides, but the Communist army still fired cold shots into the city from time to time.

### A Chinese Aircraft Test Flies in Beiping

Whether Flights Will Resume is Still Under Study

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 20th] A C.7 aircraft of China National Aviation Corporation flew to Beiping from Qingdao at 2:30 PM today and made its first test landing at an airport in the city. The situation was good. At about 3:00 PM, it took some CNAC transfer personnel and their families to Qingdao. Whether the Beiping-Qingdao-Shanghai flights, which have been suspended for a week, will resume immediately will be decided after the chief pilot returns to Shanghai and reports for study.

### Jinpu Railway is Still Open to Mingguang: The Capital Garrison General Headquarters Establishes a Command Post in the Two Pu Districts: Communist Troops Cross the Huai River and Enter the Bengbu City Area from Both the East and West Sides

[Our Newspaper, Chuxian, 20th] The Mingguang front section of the southern Jinpu Railway has been calm in recent days. The train between Mingguang and Pukou is still running smoothly. The two regiments of the Jianghuai Independent Brigade of bandits, which had previously fled to the old home mountain area 30 miles northeast of Zhangbaling Station, have been completely driven away by the National troops. Since the regular troops of the National Army withdrew from Bengbu, officials now acknowledge that a local Communist force has entered the city area. In addition, Li Yannian, commander of the Army Corps, is still stationed here.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] According to aerial reconnaissance: The Communist troops crossing the Huai River entered the Bengbu city area in succession from both the east and west sides today, and the number is close to one column. Hefei is as peaceful as usual.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Deng Wenyi, spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, announced on the 20th in response to reporters' inquiries that the National troops in Bengbu had completely withdrawn on the evening of the 19th, and the main force of the bandits has not yet entered Bengbu. The Xuzhou Bandit Suppression General Headquarters was also abolished on the 19th. Currently, the military affairs north of the Yangtze River are commanded by Li Yannian, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison and Commander of the Sixth Army Corps.

[Our Newspaper, Chuxian, 20th] After the Capital Garrison General Headquarters' Command Post in Chuzhou withdrew to Nanjing to await orders, the department recently established another command post in the Liangpu (Pukou and Puzhen) area north of the Yangtze River, with Commander Liu Bingzhe concurrently serving as commander, responsible for maintaining security and transportation in the area.

### Liu Bocheng Has Been Confirmed to Have Been Blown to Death and Du Yuming Was Executed by the Bandits

A Platoon Attached Escaped from the Bandit Area and Reported

[Our Newspaper, Chuxian, 20th] According to Feng Yuwen, a platoon attached of the former National Army Armored Corps who escaped from the bandit area: He was originally a subordinate of Lieutenant Colonel Chiang Wei-kuo. After being captured by the bandits, he was later assigned to be the driver of Liu Bocheng's private car. Liu always wears dark glasses when going out. He did not know at first that the owner of his car was the bandit Liu until he was told by others more than a month later. Feng also said that Liu Bocheng was indeed blown to death by the National Air Force while directing the battle on a car near Taoyuanji, Suxian County, a month ago. Chen Yi also suffered minor injuries to his leg. Although this news has not been formally announced in the bandit army, all bandit armies know this fact. On January 10, when the National Army broke through at Qinglongji, after the Deputy Commander of the Xuzhou Bandit Suppression General Headquarters, Du Yuming, was captured, according to unconfirmed news (the news of Liu's death has been confirmed), the bandits executed Du to vent their anger in retaliation for the death of Liu Bocheng.

### Although the Communists Disregard the People's Desire for Peace, the Nationalists Adopt a Defensive and Responsive Strategy - The Ministry of National Defense Political Warfare Bureau Releases a Weekly War Situation Report -

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Ministry of National Defense Political Warfare Bureau recently released a weekly war situation report from the 13th to the 19th, stating: At the beginning of the week, although the Communist Party put forward conditions for responding to the President's New Year's Day message, it continued to fiercely attack Tianjin, disregarding the peace wishes of the people across the country. However, the National Army was able to follow the instructions of the General Headquarters in all battlefields, adopting a defensive and responsive strategy, not taking the initiative in offensives, while actively adjusting deployments and consolidating new positions. In case the Communist Party disregards the peace wishes of the people across the country, for the sake of the people's wishes, we will not hesitate to continue a protracted war until the Communist side realizes its errors or achieves complete victory.

(1) North China Battlefield: In the Tianjin area, Lin Biao concentrated all his main forces to attack Tianjin, launching an offensive on the 6th of this month. On the 14th and 15th, he launched a fierce offensive against the National Army's positions in Tianjin. Fierce fighting took place in the Xiyingmen area. Due to the National Army's limited strength, it was forced to switch to an inner-line defense and continue fighting the bandits. The main forces of Lin Biao's units, including the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 12th Columns, were about four times the size of the Tianjin garrison. The Communist bandits suffered extremely heavy casualties. The fighting continued until the evening of the 15th before it ended. Statistics show that the Tianjin defense battle lasted 29 days, and the main forces of both sides fought for 10 days. The bandit army suffered more than 65,000 casualties. The National Army regarded Tianjin as the essence of industry and commerce in North China and could not bear excessive damage. While doing its best to fight the bandits, it also did its best to protect the lives and property of the citizens, so it was greatly affected strategically. The National Army's forbearance and burden-bearing in Tianjin resulted in losses. Due to the changes in the Tianjin battle situation, the National Army in the Tanggu area has safely withdrawn and transferred to designated areas by naval vessels in order to adapt to the new strategy. Around Beiping, there have only been minor contacts in recent days. Although people from all walks of life are doing their best to call for the preservation of this cultural capital, it is still a big question whether the Communist Party can restrain its troops to comply with the people's demands, because the Communist army seems to still be actively preparing to attack the city in recent days. Four columns of Lin Biao's troops near Tianjin have concentrated in the suburbs of Beiping.

(2) East China Battlefield: Since the end of the Xiaoyong area battle, the National Army immediately redeployed to prevent the Communist army's conspiracy of negotiating peace on one hand and attacking on the other. After a slight reorganization, it continued to invade southward. Now the National Army has actively withdrawn from various strongholds on the north bank of the Huai River to the new defensive positions south of the Huai River and north of the Yangtze River, adopting a defensive posture, deploying heavy troops, and maneuvering at any time as a vanguard base for the Yangtze River defense line. As of the 18th, the Bengbu Linhuaiguan area was still in the hands of the National Army. Small units of the Communist army carried out sneak crossings, and local battles occurred. On the north bank of the Huai River, the Communist army has suffered heavy losses to its main forces in recent months, and supply is difficult. In the short term, it seems unlikely to make large-scale movements. As for the south bank of the Huai River, the National Army is clearing out scattered bandits and deploying defense lines. Judging from the current situation, the defense of the Jiangbei area is very solid. The government and the people across the country currently desire the realization of peace, but preparations for war have not been relaxed in the slightest, adopting the principle of preparing for war while seeking peace, rather than seeking peace and forgetting war. Earlier this month, the Communist Party issued an emergency "conscription order," limiting the time to before February 15 of this year, requiring all areas in North China to conscript as many able-bodied men aged 16 to 48 as possible, totaling one million, forcing them to be sent to Handan, Hebei, for centralized training in preparation for becoming sacrificial tools for future human-wave tactics. In other areas, the Communist Party is still actively using terrorist policies and rumor offensives as the vanguard of its field troops. Therefore, peace cannot be achieved by one side alone. If the Communist Party disregards the future of the country and the nation, and disregards the wishes of the people across the country, continuing its military speculation, the government, in order to strive for the independence and freedom of the country and the nation, and to protect the people's free way of life, will not hesitate to engage in long-term warfare.

Editorial

### Looking Forward to the Improvement of US-Soviet Relations

President Truman was inaugurated as the 33rd President yesterday and delivered an inaugural address, saying that he will do his best to promote the Democratic Party's platform and seek world peace for mankind; at the same time, he also emphasized that the friendship of all mankind should go hand in hand with other sacred virtues of human behavior. The speech was short, lasting only fifteen minutes, and was broadcast worldwide via radio. In today's turbulent world situation, people from all countries around the world have heard President Truman's call for peace and regard it as a ray of sunshine piercing through the international haze, and place infinite hope in it.

Looking back at international politics since the end of World War II, it is not difficult to prove that the crux of today's international problems lies in the irreconcilable differences between the United States and the Soviet Union. If the two world powers can one day resolve their suspicions and restore the spirit of fighting side by side during the war to win victory, then all current international problems will be easily solved. Based on this correct understanding, people unanimously believe that if the world is to achieve true peace, it is necessary to first seek coordination between the United States and the Soviet Union. Since President Truman has taken the creation of world peace as his own responsibility, what he must first strive for is to seek understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union. On the eve of President Truman's inauguration, the Soviet Union had already published an article in the "News Report" issued by the Soviet Embassy in the United States, advocating "mutual understanding to promote friendship between the United States and the Soviet Union." Although this article can be regarded as the Soviet Union's "peace offensive," it may not be impossible as an opportunity for the transformation of US-Soviet relations, which is worthy of the world's attention. Acting Secretary of State Lovett also made a statement on the 19th, saying that the United States welcomes the Soviet Union to prove its sincerity for peace with a constructive cooperative attitude, and hopes that the Soviet Union can adopt a more cooperative attitude on the Berlin blockade issue and the Austrian peace treaty issue.

Judging from Lovett's remarks, there is still a considerable distance between the United States and the Soviet Union, and it is not possible to improve relations between the two countries overnight; but President Truman promised voters during the election that he would strive to achieve understanding with Soviet leaders in the next four years to ensure world peace; now that he has just taken office, he should work hard in this direction in order to fulfill his promises and live up to the expectations of voters; otherwise, the opposition party will definitely use this as an excuse to attack the Truman government, not to mention that the Executive Committee of the American Progressive Party has already issued a declaration demanding that President Truman implement his statement of "we all need peace" and meet directly with Stalin to negotiate the basic conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union. Therefore, looking at the general trend, the US government will definitely try its best to break the deadlock between the United States and the Soviet Union in the future. Recently, Secretary of State Marshall's resignation, with the vacancy filled by Acheson, can indeed be regarded as a prelude to American diplomacy pointing in a new direction.

At present, although the US government and the public are still full of anti-communist and anti-Soviet rhetoric, which is enough to hinder the development of the movement to improve US-Soviet relations; however, reviewing the US's two-year-long diplomacy towards the Soviet Union, one cannot but admit that the use of American diplomacy has indeed failed to be completely satisfactory. To be fair, the so-called Truman Doctrine and the so-called Marshall Plan, from the perspective of the US's anti-communist and anti-Soviet stance, are indeed a tough method; but in terms of the peace of the whole world, what are the consequences? It is worthy of in-depth study; moreover, the State Department often hesitates when implementing it, and cannot act vigorously and thoroughly achieve its goals; it cannot even be universally promoted, forgetting the integrity of the world, and distinguishing between Europe and Asia, achieving some achievements in Europe, but reducing its significance due to the backwardness in Asia. Therefore, today's America, unless it ignores everything and acts recklessly to the end, it must consider how to improve relations with the Soviet Union.

In short, US-Soviet cooperation is a prerequisite for world peace. Whether it is the people of all countries in the world, or the people of the United States and the Soviet Union themselves, as long as they love peace and hate war, they all hope that the United States and the Soviet Union can resolve their suspicions and promote friendship between the two countries with sincerity and goodwill. However, the opportunity to improve US-Soviet relations, like other opportunities, is fleeting; now that there is this new brewing in the international community, which is conducive to the development of good relations between the two countries, we should naturally hope that both the United States and the Soviet Union can especially cherish this good opportunity, face reality squarely, seize the opportunity, immediately improve US-Soviet relations, reverse the international trend, and make the whole world turn hostility into peace and harmony.

### Truman Delivers Inaugural Address, Unveils Four Diplomatic Principles, Emphasizing Winning Through Bloodless Struggle

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th, United Press] President Truman, taking office today, declared that our faith in democracy can defeat communism and all its evils, and win peace in the future. Truman was sworn in as the 33rd President of the United States today in a solemn ceremony here. After that, he delivered an inaugural address, urging the nation to have faith and strive for victory through a bloodless struggle. He also said that this struggle should be initiated by us. The President announced four principles of foreign policy today, saying that these four principles will make all free countries strong and prosperous, dispel the illusions of communist countries, and coexist peacefully with us. This afternoon, Barkley was sworn in as Vice President under the supervision of Judge Lee, and Truman was sworn in as President under the supervision of Chief Justice Vinson of the Supreme Court. Millions of people gathered in this colorful square today to witness this historic scene and the street parade. When Truman placed his left hand on two Bibles and swore "I will support and protect the Constitution," the crowd cheered enthusiastically. The President's inaugural address barely mentioned domestic issues, but emphasized winning the Cold War without letting it evolve into a real war. President Truman did not directly mention the Soviet Union today, but he made lengthy, sharp, and detailed criticisms of communism. He compared communism and democracy point by point, making a clear comparison between the shortcomings of communism's false philosophy and the advantages of the American democratic way of life. He also emphasized that the United States hopes for peace above all else, but he immediately stated that peace cannot be achieved by "appeasing the Communist Party," but only by strengthening the strength of free countries in economic, military, and social aspects. He also said that people in other countries around the world, including those under communist leadership, are waiting anxiously for future developments, and waiting for the friendship and assistance of the United States, as well as wise leadership, with an anxiety never seen before. He then declared the four principles of the "Peace and Freedom" plan, saying that the US foreign policy for the next four years will be based on these four principles. The four principles are: (1) Continue to support the United Nations; (2) Do our best to support the European Recovery Program; (3) Strengthen the strength of free countries through collective defense treaties and military assistance to Western Europe, so that aggressors dare not covet life; (4) Assist backward countries with strong forces, so that they become prosperous democratic countries.

[United Press, Washington, 20th] President Truman's oath is as follows: "I solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States." When Truman took the oath, he used two Bibles, harmonizing religious sentiments and love for his homeland. His left hand touched the two books from time to time. The small Bible was placed on top of the opened large Bible. This small Bible was the one he used when he was sworn in as President after Roosevelt's death on April 12, 1945. The large Bible is the original Gutenberg Bible, which has a history of 493 years.

### Key Points of Truman's Speech: Strengthening Democratic Forces as Policy Goal, Willing to Live Together in Peaceful Coordination

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th, United Press] The key points of President Truman's inaugural address are as follows: Today is not only the beginning of a new government taking office, but also the beginning of a period that will ultimately determine the future of us and the world. The most important need for us today is that the world faces a serious situation in the future, and how it will develop is unknown. At this time of rampant suspicion, the world's expectations for America's goodwill, strength, and wise leadership are greater than ever. Therefore, we should declare the main principles we trust and our goals at this time.

Conflict of Ideologies

Most importantly, we hope for a fair and lasting peace, and we will do our best to achieve it. And this kind of peace should be based on equal status, free discussion, and genuine agreement. In pursuit of this goal, the United States and other like-minded countries have noticed that they are directly facing a regime that is contrary to our goals, and whose life concepts are completely different from ours. This false philosophy is communism. Communism believes that the division of the world into hostile classes is inevitable, while democracy believes that free countries can fairly resolve differences and maintain lasting peace. A year ago, we and sixteen free European countries launched the most ambitious economic cooperation plan in history. The purpose of this work is to strengthen the strength of democratic Europe, so that the free people on the continent can contribute to the safety and well-being of the world in their correct position in civilization. Our efforts have restored hope to mankind, we have repelled defeatism, and we have spared some countries from losing their freedom. Millions of people around the world share the same view with us, that is, we do not need war, we can achieve peace, and we have the power to initiate it. In the next few years, our peace and freedom plan will focus on the following four points:

Four Principles

That is (1) continue to firmly support the United Nations, seek ways to strengthen its prestige and increase its power. (2) Continue the world economic recovery plan, that is, we must first fully support the aid-to-Europe plan. We firmly believe that this major attempt at world recovery will be successful, and countries cooperating with us can restore their self-sufficiency. (3) We will strengthen peace-loving countries to resist the crisis of aggression. We are now entering into agreements with several countries to strengthen the security of the North Atlantic. This type of agreement is a collective defense measure within the scope of the United Nations Charter. We have already established this defense agreement for the Western Hemisphere in the Rio de Janeiro Treaty. The basic purpose of this agreement is to express the common determination of free countries to jointly resist armed attacks. I hope to submit it to the Senate soon. Regarding the treaty on the North Atlantic Security Plan, (4) We must launch a bold new plan to use scientific progress and industrial development to develop backward areas. Our purpose should be to assist free people to increase production through their own efforts.

Prosperity and Freedom

The exploitative behavior of imperialism in the past has no place in our plans. The proper utilization of world resources will benefit all countries in the world, including the United States. According to past experience, as other countries progress in industry and economy, the trade between the United States and these countries will also increase. Increasing production is a basic condition for prosperity and peace. Based on the above four ways, we hope to help all mankind to obtain freedom and happiness. Anyone who seeks a free life, truth and security, and hopes for freedom of speech and religion can support us. Millions of people around the world who are eager for justice are also our allies.

### The Material Supply Committee Announces the Reasons for the Delayed Allocation of Coal Briquettes and Cooking Oil to Civil Servants and Teachers, Allocation Can Be Made Around the Lunar New Year

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the reasons for the delayed allocation of coal briquettes and cooking oil to civil servants and teachers, Zeng Gangfu, the chief secretary of the Municipal Civil Servants and Teachers Material Supply Committee, issued a statement yesterday, explaining that the delay was due to: (1) The supply of cooking oil for civil servants and teachers was previously designated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to be the responsibility of the China Vegetable Oil Factory. Due to the continuous rise in prices, the factory stipulated that transactions must be made in cash, which delayed the process of allocating funds. The factory, in view of the urgent need for oil by civil servants and teachers, is preparing to first allocate one month's worth of oil for November to meet the urgent need. After repeated negotiations, it was decided to start selling it on February 2. (2) After the end of the Public Utility Coal Allocation Committee, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce designated the Shanghai Office of the Anthracite Coal Adjustment Committee to be responsible for handling the allocation of coal. The committee entrusted the joint management office of the Kailuan, East China, Huainan, and Taiwan mines to handle the supply business. However, the coal briquettes and the difference in price were all advanced by the joint management office of the four mines and have not yet been allocated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. After submitting separate letters urging payment, it is now learned that the Executive Yuan has already allocated the funds. Once they arrive in Shanghai, the allocation can be carried out within a week, around the Lunar New Year. (3) Before November of last year, civil servant and teacher in-kind purchase certificates were issued at the end of each month, and the shopping period ended on the 20th of the following month. Since December, the committee has issued them earlier at the beginning of the month, and the shopping period ends at the end of the month, which has resulted in another month's delay in the allocation of coal briquettes and cooking oil. (4) The committee is only responsible for verifying the number of people, checking the reimbursement, and issuing purchase certificates. The actual supply of materials is handled separately by the relevant ministries and commissions designated by the Executive Yuan. Rice is supplied by the Shanghai Grain General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food. Coal briquettes, cooking oil, and cloth are supplied by the Shanghai Office of the Anthracite Coal Adjustment Committee, the China Vegetable Oil Factory, and the China Textile Company. Sugar is supplied by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation of the Resources Committee. Salt is supplied by the Shanghai Salt Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance. The prices of all allocated materials are also directly allocated by the Executive Yuan to various ministries and commissions and then distributed to the various supply agencies.

### Xin Xianlin and Qunli Equally Share the Nanshi Championship, Extended Time Resulted in a 2-2 Tie

In yesterday's Nanshi football final, Xin Xianlin faced Qunli. In the first half, Xue Peiran of Xin Xianlin scored two goals. In the second half, Xin Xianlin was saving a dangerous ball in front of the goal, and Gao Baozheng accidentally scored an own goal. Then, Chen Longquan of Qunli took a free kick and directly hit the target, tying the score at 2-2. At the end of the time, the score was tied, so the time was extended for 30 minutes to determine the final outcome. As a result, there were no gains, and the original record was maintained. Since the Lunar New Year is approaching, it was decided to divide the championship equally and no longer replay the game. The sports venue also added a silver cup and presented it to both sides for encouragement. More than 1,200 people watched yesterday's game, and their generosity was commendable.

Gao Baozheng of Xin Xianlin performed the best. Wu Kaimin and Xue Peiran were also very colorful. In terms of the front line, Xiao Ziwen, Lu Qingxiang, and Chen Qin were all very dedicated. It is a pity that center Fei Chunlin was weak, and goalkeeper Zhu Xinzhang was also poor, otherwise, they might have won the championship. Everyone in Qunli worked hard. The counterattack in the second half showed the strength of the group. Xi Boming's goalkeeping was obviously superior to the opponent, and it was not in vain to share the championship.

After the start of the game, Xin Xianlin's offensive was quite strong. After eleven minutes, Xue Peiran took a long shot in front of the goal, opening the scoring. After twenty-eight minutes, Xiao Ziwen took two corner kicks, and the second time he crossed, Xue Peiran headed in with his back, "Great."

Changing positions and fighting again, Qunli changed from defense to offense. In less than three minutes, a group of people were squeezed in front of Xin Xianlin's goal. The ball was only two yards away from the goal. In this critical situation, Gao Baozheng stepped forward to rescue, but his toe touched it and it turned into an own goal. Twenty-nine minutes Chen Longquan opened a free kick at 30 yards in front of the Xin Xianlin gate and entered the net from the air. This has become a 2-2 tie, and the victory is undecided at the end of the time. Extend for 30 minutes, the record is as usual, both parties are happy and scattered.

### Postmen and Messengers Prohibited from Soliciting Holiday Tips

As the Lunar New Year is approaching, the Municipal Postal Bureau, Telegraph Bureau, and International Radio Station, in order to strictly prohibit postmen and messengers or criminals from impersonating them to solicit holiday tips from all walks of life, are appealing to all sectors to cooperate in refusing to give tips. If it is discovered that postmen or messengers are soliciting tips while delivering mail or newspapers, the number and appearance of the postman or messenger can be noted and reported to the radio station in writing or by telephone.

### No Progress in Export Situation After New Year Due to the Influence of the Current Situation; Export Control Committee Releases Semi-Monthly Export Overview

According to the Export Control Committee, the export situation in the second half of the New Year has not progressed with the New Year due to the current situation. In the past two weeks, prices in Shanghai have risen sharply, and inland ports such as Kunming, Rong, and Hankou have also reported price increases, with export goods increasing in price by one to two times compared to the end of last year. At the same time, domestic exchange rates have risen, which has affected general export trade.

The price of foreign exchange transfer certificates rose steadily in the first half of the month, which was quite encouraging for exports but affected the buying interest of importers. Therefore, the Central Bank issued Foreign Exchange Circular No. 170 on the 10th, stipulating the identity of buyers of foreign exchange transfer certificates. Except for those who hold import permits or those who have applied for import and are expected to be approved, ordinary people are not allowed to purchase them, in order to comply with the principle of import and export linkage and to prevent non-industry people from competing to purchase and arbitrage. As a result, after the 14th, the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates fell, even falling below the overseas remittance exchange rate. Exporters generally believe that the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates should at least maintain the level of overseas remittances; otherwise, exports will be sluggish.

As for foreign market conditions, most are stable. Pig bristles are showing promise in the UK. According to the latest telegram from the Bank of China in London, on the 7th, the import prices there were 24 shillings per pound for Chongqing No. 27 long bristles, 13.5 shillings for short bristles, 27.5 shillings for Hankou long bristles, 12 shillings for short bristles, 23 shillings for Shanghai No. 27 long bristles, 12 shillings for short bristles, 60 shillings for Tianjin No. 55 long bristles, 45 shillings for short bristles, and 40 shillings for No. 26 short bristles.

Due to the gradual recovery of various countries around the world after the war, the output of goods last year has increased significantly compared to the previous year, and therefore general countries attach importance to export trade. Japan is particularly active. Our authorities are paying close attention to exports. In addition to opening up private cash trade with Japan this year to increase Sino-Japanese commerce, other promotional measures are also being strengthened and discussed separately.
