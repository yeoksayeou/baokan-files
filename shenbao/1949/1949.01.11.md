### Truman Did Not Propose New US Aid to China, State Department Denies Obstructing Aid to China Plan

[Dispatch from Washington, United Press, 11th] President Truman avoided mentioning the issue of new US aid to China in his budget message on the 11th. Truman postponed this whole issue to "later," which seems to coincide with the rumors that he is waiting to see what happens to the Chinese government. The State Department denied that there was any plan to "shelve" aid to China. Another spokesman emphasized that the two aid to China plans approved by the Eightieth Congress are "daily" in progress.

It is generally believed that the wording "currently includes" used by Truman is a chance to take a step back. An official said that Greece and Turkey can get new US aid as soon as the plan is drafted, but he refused to speculate on the plans for the other two countries.

These statistics illustrate two points: first, more than 100 frozen corpses are found and collected on the streets of Shanghai every day, and the majority are children's corpses; second, as the weather turns colder, the number of frozen corpses is increasing daily, and the increase in mortality is mainly due to the abandonment of children and infants.

Clearly, this is a serious social problem that illustrates the tragedy of the human world and the fate of orphans in troubled times, leading to death. Facing this situation, if the government authorities and philanthropists do not urgently rescue this group of dying orphans, and do not thoroughly implement social relief, the painful tragedy will not stop because of the warming weather. The misery of the human world will inevitably continue to occur and deepen.

How do we know how this social problem arises? According to sociology and social phenomena, this social problem currently exists for at least two reasons: first, because of poverty, and second, because of war. Regarding the relationship between the two, the expansion of urban poverty and death is entirely based on war. From a social historical perspective, poverty is the cause of war, or rather, war is the result of poverty. If there is no poverty in society, there will be no war; after a war occurs, it will invariably affect poverty in society. From the perspective of war development, in a war-torn society, whether on the front lines or in the rear, the value of life is like grass; the lives of men, women, old, and young are readily thrown onto barbed wire, rubble ruins, streets, and roadsides. Therefore, war not only destroys construction and obliterates the lives of our contemporaries but also buries the lives of our next generation! Recently, there was a film in Shanghai called "Orphans in Troubled Times," reflecting the fate of a group of orphans in war. They suffer the most brutal persecution, are separated from their parents and families, and are constantly humiliated and harmed, eroding their childhood. They are gloomy, dim, fearful, and suspicious. Finally, they lose their lives. Clearly, this is a depiction of the tragedy of the next generation of humanity. After the President's New Year's Day message, the Shanghai Municipal Council called for a ceasefire between the two sides. In their appeal telegram, they said, "In the past two or three years, countless people have been killed, and our compatriots are suffering deeply. Who doesn't have parents? Who doesn't have siblings? Who doesn't have spouses? Who doesn't have children? The strong are scattered in all directions, the old are wandering in ditches, and the human hell is heartbreaking." This fully illustrates that social poverty and human separation are entirely based on war, entirely rooted in war.

Therefore, in order to urgently rescue this group of dying orphans in society and to thoroughly implement social relief, we must first demand peace within the country. Only with domestic peace can there be social peace. Secondly, in an environment of peaceful construction, we need to establish a social relief system to thoroughly implement social conservation and health care, not only to preserve the lives of our contemporaries but also to conserve the lives of the next generation. As for the large number of children's corpses abandoned on the streets of Shanghai, most are abandoned infants from poor families, and a very small portion are children who died in hospitals and were not collected. This is entirely a phenomenon caused by social poverty. Currently, the Shanghai Municipal Government is actively promoting winter relief, and the purpose of winter relief is to relieve poverty and help poor families get through the cold winter. Therefore, we hope that the Shanghai Municipal Relief Committee and charitable organizations will face this serious social problem squarely and quickly find ways to rescue this group of dying orphans under the dual beliefs of compassion and love! In short, the lives of the next generation are as precious as the lives of our contemporaries. Our responsibility today is not only to preserve the lives of our contemporaries and demand the realization of domestic peace and social peace, but also to preserve the lives of our future generations, making their childhood and souls especially strong, and not allowing the cold currents of Siberia to kill them!

### At the Kuomintang Memorial Week Interior Minister Hong Lanyou Delivers His First Policy Report Briefly Elaborating on Eight Aspects Such as Governance

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters held a memorial week this morning.

At the same time, we hope that the country's entire personnel system can be effectively established, that the advancement of staff members is based entirely on examination, that promotions and demotions are based entirely on performance, and that salaries and grades are reasonable.

Regarding local autonomy, Hong stated that to promote local autonomy, it is necessary to improve grassroots organizations first. In the future, we should strive to strengthen the grassroots organizations, and supervise and implement them in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "Local Autonomy Begins Implementation Law," taking into account local conditions. Regarding police administration, Hong said that police administration is the basic work for stabilizing social order and all construction. The police department of the Ministry of Interior is committed to establishing a police system of balanced power.

Hong also reported on household administration, customs, construction, territory, and prohibition.

Finally, Hong also expressed his personal opinions on the operational data of the Ministry of Interior.

### Senior Staff Officers of the Chinese Communist Army Mostly Graduated from Soviet Military Academies Soviet Aircraft Expert Tukayev Reveals That Many of the Communist Areas' Ordnance Factories Were Established Under Soviet Guidance

[Central News Agency, London, 9th] Lieutenant Colonel Tukayev, a Soviet turbojet aircraft expert who fled to Britain a few months ago, wrote an article in this morning's Sunday Express, revealing that the Soviet Union is strengthening the communist revolution, plunging China into communist rule, in order to concentrate on its sinister plans for Europe. It is said that the collapse of China was due to the following two extreme mistakes: first, the Western countries' indifferent attitude towards the Soviet Union's seizure of Outer Mongolia, which has long been the Soviet Union's main ordnance factory in Asia. This is also the main reason for China's collapse. Second, when Marshall was working to promote the formation of a Chinese coalition government, the United States recognized the Chinese Communists as true "freedom fighters for on-the-spot reform," whose purpose was to overthrow the existing government. Tukayev continued to reveal that the senior staff positions in the Chinese Communist army are filled by Soviet officers of Chinese, Korean, and Mongolian descent. Most of them have recently served in the Soviet army and graduated from various Soviet military academies. In the Soviet areas in China, weapon factories have recently been established, most of which were established under Soviet guidance. It is said that after Japan surrendered, the Chinese Communists obtained a large number of Japanese weapons from the Soviet army, as well as a large number of Soviet-made weapons, but their trademarks were changed to those made in foreign countries. Tukayev believes that the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Treaty in 1945 was the most foolish mistake of President Chiang's life. In the treaty, the Soviet Union agreed to supply President Chiang with military supplies, but no Soviet military supplies were ever delivered to Chiang. It is also said that Outer Mongolia is the backstage source of the Chinese Communist power. Outer Mongolia is the Soviet Union's fortress and ordnance factory in Asia. A large number of Soviet land and air forces are stationed in Outer Mongolia, just like in any area within the Soviet Union. Tukayev said that in the Kremlin's blueprint for ruling the world, Europe is the first task and Asia is the second task. After the collapse of Germany, Stalin was convinced that within a few years, he would be the master of the European continent. However, due to the failure of the communist movements in Italy, France, and Germany, Tito's betrayal, and the return of American power to Europe under the Marshall Plan, the Soviet Union's westward advance was temporarily halted. The Moscow Politburo believes that the struggle in Europe is far more difficult than expected, and it is not dangerous to fully seek the end of the struggle in Europe before the end of the second task. Therefore, the Politburo decided to shift its attention and become the first in Asia. Tukayev continued to warn: If the Western countries cannot stop Stalin in the East, then the inevitable showdown in the West will soon arrive, and various conditions will become increasingly favorable to Stalin.

### The Ministry of Finance is Conducting a Thorough Investigation into the Central Bank's Staff's Gold Exchange

However, a certain branch of the Central Bank still handled deposits and exchanges for colleagues after the 6th, and the date on the application was filled in as the 5th.

### President Truman Presents a Huge Peacetime Budget to Congress - Total Exceeds 40 Billion, Military Spending Accounts for One-Third - Continued Economic Recovery Not Included

[United Press Washington dispatch, 9th] President Truman today submitted to Congress the largest peacetime budget, totaling 41.858 billion dollars, half of which will be used to conduct the Cold War against the Soviet Union, and the cost of arming Western Europe is not included, which will be submitted separately later this year. The new budget includes the expenses for the twelve months starting on July 1 this year, and the total amount increased by 1.678 billion dollars compared with fiscal year 1949. The budget for fiscal year 1949 also set a peacetime record. The President stated in his message that even without counting the cost of arming Western Europe, the US budget for 1950 will have a deficit of 873 million dollars, higher than the deficit of 600 million dollars in 1949, unless taxes are increased to fill the gap. Future budgets will need to be expanded to accommodate the increasingly important responsibilities of the United States to the world and to compensate for the greatly expanded national defense military equipment. The 1950 budget is dominated by international and national defense programs, and its nature is the same as the budgets of previous post-war years. Foreign aid and national defense together account for 21 billion dollars. The focus of the President's new budget includes: (1) International affairs and foreign aid expenses of 6.7 billion dollars, a decrease of 500 million dollars compared with 1949. The amount under the Marshall Plan will be reduced by 100 million dollars. Special aid to China will be reduced from 380 million dollars to 49 million dollars, but the aid plan of 355 million dollars will be shared by China, South Korea, Greece, and Turkey. (2) National defense expenses of nearly 14.3 billion dollars, accounting for one-third of the total budget, an increase of 2.5 billion dollars compared with 1949. Among them, the funds for equipping the army, especially the air force's research and industrial mobilization, are 3.1 billion dollars, the cost of stockpiling strategic military raw materials is 530 million dollars, and the cost of universal military training is 600 million dollars. The President continued in his message that the United States must continue to promote world peace and domestic prosperity with all its strength. The past US assistance to Western Europe and the mutual assistance of various countries have made great progress in economic recovery and political stability. The United States today is a powerful barrier to freedom in the world. In order to maintain its own strength, the United States must be well prepared. The military building plan proposed in this budget is the largest military force in peacetime. Most of the foreign aid expenses are used to revive the economies of free countries in Western Europe. The revival of Western Europe is the key to maintaining independence and freedom in other parts of the world. Our investment in the recovery of Europe will surely reap multiple rewards in terms of peace. However, in the current environment, economic power is not enough to provide a solid guarantee for free people. The United States, in accordance with the United Nations Charter, is discussing with some Western European countries the security measures to enhance the North Atlantic region. The cost of military assistance to Western Europe and assistance to some countries that have a significant relationship with US security are difficult to estimate for the time being, and will be submitted separately in the future. In short, the budget needs to be expanded to meet the needs of this plan, which further shows that national treasury revenue must be increased in the next few years. The main foreign relief activities of the United States in the future will be to relieve the occupied areas of Germany and Japan.

### Military and Political Authorities Discuss Middle East Situation - British Fleet Concentrates and Waits for Orders - Will Blockade the Israeli Coast If Necessary

[Our report] New York 10th broadcast: Israel is preparing to file a formal complaint against Britain to the Security Council. At the same time, it is rumored that Britain is also preparing to file a counter-complaint against the new Jewish state.

[United Press London dispatch, 10th] As a powerful British fleet concentrates at a location only 48 hours away from Tel Aviv, Britain is considering sending naval, land, and air reinforcements to the eastern Mediterranean on the 10th. British Prime Minister Attlee and Foreign Secretary Bevin discussed the British-Israeli crisis caused by Israel's downing of five British aircraft. Afterwards, an emergency meeting of the Cabinet Defense Committee was convened at No. 10 Downing Street. In addition to the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary, representatives from the Army, Navy, and Air Force and the Chiefs of Staff of the three services attended.

A Navy Department spokesman said, when talking about naval operations in the Mediterranean, that the commander-in-chief in the area has the right to assemble ships, and reinforcements are in the hands of the higher authorities. Although Israel refuses to accept British protests, the British Foreign Office does not seem to mind.

[United Press London dispatch, 9th] The Navy Department announced today that Britain is now concentrating warships in the Middle East as a backing for a strong protest against the Israeli military's downing of British aircraft. The aircraft carrier "Triumph" and the cruiser "Frobisher," which were patrolling the Mediterranean, have been ordered to return to Malta to join other warships. Two British ships have already set sail for Cyprus. A marine battalion is also waiting for orders in Malta. All British naval soldiers on the island are not allowed to leave the island tonight.

[Agence France-Presse Cairo dispatch] Observers here believe that if Israel fails to give a satisfactory reply to Britain's protest, Britain's first step will be to impose a blockade on the Israeli coast. Observers also pointed out that the Palestine incident will become an increasingly sharp conflict between the West and the Soviet Union, because according to their opinions, Israel has received military supplies from Eastern European countries, and the British headquarters in the Suez Canal area has already become a wartime system.

### Israel Refuses British Protest - Acknowledges British Act of War

[United Press Tel Aviv dispatch, 9th] After a meeting today, the Israeli Cabinet instructed the country's representative to the United Nations to ask the Security Council to recognize "British acts of war."

He said that the protest was addressed to the "Jewish Authorities of Tel Aviv" instead of the Provisional Government of Israel, and was therefore considered unacceptable and returned.

### Friction Between Britain and Israel - Britain Temporarily Takes a By-Stander

[United Press Washington dispatch, 9th] The United States is adopting a policy of non-intervention in the conflict between Britain and Israel, at least for the time being. A State Department spokesman said that the United States has not expressed any opinion on the downing of five British aircraft by Israel, because the United States is not directly involved in the matter. However, the fear of a large-scale war, which may cause the Middle East to fall into the hands of the Soviet Union, may force US officials to express an opinion on this dispute. Even if the United States wants to express an opinion, it will be announced through the United Nations.

### Indian Prime Minister Nehru Clarifies Rumors - Denies Forming Asian Group - Purpose of Delhi Conference is to Express Sympathy for Indonesia

### US Senate to Propose Factory Construction Plan

Guaranteeing Permanent Full Employment

[Central News Agency Washington 9th United Press] The US Senate will propose a revolutionary factory construction plan tomorrow to guarantee a permanent "full employment" plan, initiated by Senators Sparkman and Murray, and known as the Full Employment Act of 1950. When President Truman presented the State of the Union address to Congress last week, he said that government loans should be used to expand production equipment.

### Atomic Clock Counts Accurately - New Invention by US Scientists

[US News Service Washington dispatch, 9th] The US Bureau of Standards has recently adopted a revolutionary new method of measuring time with atoms. It is said that its accuracy is more reliable than measuring time with celestial bodies. This atomic clock was unveiled at a ceremony held on Thursday. The atomic clock uses the natural frequency of the vibrations inside the cesium molecule. Because atomic activity is constant, the new clock is irrelevant to climate, pressure, and old or new. This atomic clock is more accurate than any previous clock, and can free human beings from relying on the old method of measuring time according to the earth's rotation. The components of the atomic clock include a copper tube filled with cesium gas up to 30 feet, installed in two small rooms. The atomic vibration of argon is "observed" by sensitive wireless measurement, which is used to control an oscillator, and finally drives the hands. The inventor of this principle is Dr. Lyon, director of the Microscopic Measurement Group of the US Bureau of Standards.

### Eleven-Year Cycle - Sunspots Decrease

[United Press Washington dispatch, 9th] Naval Observatory Director Clark said that the peak of the sunspot's eleven-year cycle has passed, and the number of sunspots is expected to decrease in the next few years. The most was in February 1946, when telegrams and wireless radio were strongly disturbed. Meteorologists have different views on the impact of sunspots on ground-based meteorological phenomena. Some believe that during the period of increased sunspots, ultraviolet rays increase accordingly, which is enough to change the ground atmospheric pressure, thus causing climate change.

### Holy Land Dispute Mediator - Bunche to Rhode Island

[Agence France-Presse New York dispatch, 9th] UN mediator Bunche and UN Supervisory Officer Riley took a plane to Rhode Island this afternoon to lead the Rhodes Island-Israel armistice negotiations. Before leaving, they told news reporters that the future negotiations are expected to stabilize the overall situation and establish an armistice. This armistice will open the way for reconciliation and lead to the resolution of political issues such as boundary demarcation. Bunche refused to express any opinion on the recent unfortunate events between Britain and Israel until he received the report from the Holy Land Supervisor. He only said that he hoped that this matter would not affect the discussions to be held in Rhode Island. However, he pointed out that since the ceasefire order was issued, no party, including Britain, should engage in military activities.

### Hirohito Meets MacArthur - Content of Talks Not Disclosed

[Agence France-Presse Tokyo dispatch, 10th] Emperor Hirohito of Japan paid a visit to MacArthur this morning for a two-hour meeting. This is Hirohito's seventh visit since Japan surrendered. No communiqué was issued on the content of the talks. However, US and Japanese sources believe that during this meeting, Hirohito may have reviewed the situation in Japan and the Far East with MacArthur due to the development of the Chinese situation, because Hirohito once expressed concern about the weakness of the Japanese police force, which is not enough to cope with possible riots. Some sources here believe that Hirohito's consultations this morning may involve the issue of the communist forces currently facing Japan, which are increasing day by day. In any case, even in the current Cold War, Japan's position in resisting communism is still important from the perspective of the United States.

Yesterday, the Exchange Bank sold a large number of exchange settlement certificates, and credit has been tightened, and goods prices have also fallen. However, there is currently a lot of floating capital on the market, so it is questionable whether this policy can be effective for a long time.

In addition, National Bank Governor Yu Hongjun went to Nanjing on official business last week, and returned to Shanghai from Nanjing at 8:00 yesterday morning. He went to the National Bank to handle official business in the morning.

[Our report] In order to investigate the actual situation of various banks in the city in handling gold and silver deposit and exchange, the Ministry of Finance has sent auditors to Shanghai to check the account books of the contracted banks.

### Public Utilities Automatically Adjust Prices - Public Works Bureau Chief Says It is Impossible to Accept

### Overcharging on Public Telephones - Can Report to the Company

[Our report] After the price increase of public utilities in the city, the telephone company stipulates that public telephones cost three yuan each time. However, in fact, stores with public telephones in the urban area generally charge five yuan each time, exceeding the prescribed price by almost double. As for those who borrow private telephones from various households, the price charged each time is as high as fifteen yuan. According to the business department of the telephone company, public telephones in various places cannot be overcharged according to the company's regulations. If all sectors provide evidence to report to the company, the company will try to take unified measures. It is learned that the telephone company does not subsidize the stores that install public telephones, so the overcharging by the stores is obviously a disguised way of collecting subsidies themselves.

(2) As for student rice, the Civil Affairs Association has not yet finished issuing the rice ration for December, and requested to reissue it. It is hoped that the monthly rice ration for each school will be issued to each school within the first five days of the current month in the future, and the ration price is also expected to be announced as soon as possible so that self-funded students can pay according to the fee. (3) The treatment of professors is now adjusted to be issued at 15 times. The Ministry of Education previously remitted six months at a time according to the November standard, but it is only equivalent to twice the new standard for January. It is requested that this amount be issued at one time. (4) Student public funds, school fees, and living allowances for faculty and staff are requested to be issued at three months at a time as an emergency fund. (5) Since the opening of price limits, public utilities expenses such as water, electricity, gas, and telephone have soared. It now costs about one million yuan per school per month, but the regular expenses allocated by the Ministry of Education are only ten thousand yuan, which is only 1%. It is requested to increase the regular expenses in the future, otherwise, please the government directly pay for the public utility expenses of each school.

The Ministry of Education has now negotiated with the Central Bank to increase the overdraft amount for each school.

### Air Transport of Food to Tianjin and Beijing: Many Technical Difficulties Remain. US-Aided 9,000 Tons of Wheat Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Today

It is reported that the government, in view of the interrupted sea routes between Shanghai and Tianjin and Beijing, intends in principle to supply food to Tianjin and Beijing by air transport. However, there are many technical difficulties with this matter, and the high cost of freight is one of them. Therefore, a final decision has not yet been made. It is heard that the price of flour in Tianjin and Beijing is 1,200 yuan per bag, but the freight cost per bag is 2,500 yuan. To date, there are still more than 30,000 bags of flour, a shortfall from October, remaining in Shanghai for transshipment to Tianjin and Beijing.

### Hankou Airport Under Repair: Air Mail Re-routed by Train

[Our Dispatch] According to news from the Municipal Post Office, Hankou Airport has been under repair since December 22 of last year.

### Presidents of Private Colleges and Universities Discuss Tuition Standards: Based on Rice or Index, Final Decision Pending

[Our Dispatch] The presidents of private colleges and universities in this city held a symposium at the Tsinghua Alumni Association yesterday afternoon, attended by more than 20 people. The meeting discussed the issue of tuition standards for the next semester. It was generally believed that calculating the next semester's fees based on the upper semester's standards multiplied by the cost of living index would be too different from calculating them based on rice as the standard, which would affect the livelihood of faculty and staff. Therefore, it is still planned to use three and a half to four and a half dan of rice as the standard, and the principle of collecting fees in one lump sum. Because most schools need to start school by mid-February, there is still a month to go, and there will be many changes in the situation and rice prices. Therefore, it was decided to hold another meeting on February 7 to discuss and make a final decision.

St. John's

Acting President Zhao Xiuhong reported at the meeting that the school had already started classes yesterday. The semester is divided into three terms. The first term ends on February 19. The tuition and miscellaneous fees for each term are calculated by multiplying the base amount of 32 yuan by the cost of living index. The first term is calculated at 18.3 times the index at the end of December, totaling 585 yuan. There are more than a thousand students in the entire school. Because the fee amount is not high, there are no longer as many cases of late payment or requests for free tuition as in the last semester.

Datong

Principal Hu Dunfu reported that the school's term is also divided into three terms, with tuition and miscellaneous fees of 33.33 yuan per term calculated according to the cost of living index. The first term is scheduled to officially start on the 14th. The tuition fees for each term are settled separately to maintain flexibility in order to end in stages depending on the situation.

Shanghai College

Secretary-General Sun Ruilin reported that the school is scheduled to start school on the 12th and classes on the 17th. It has not yet been decided whether the standard for tuition and miscellaneous fees will be calculated according to the cost of living index or rice. If calculated according to the index, the livelihood of faculty and staff cannot be maintained. Therefore, it is considering using four or four and a half dan of rice as the standard, which is pending final decision. Many parents of students have requested to pay in installments, but the school plans to collect the full amount in one lump sum in principle.

Soochow

President Yang Yongqing reported that the school's law school will start school on the 21st. Tuition and miscellaneous fees may also be paid in two installments, and the standard is being considered based on the cost of living index.

### Seven Representatives Appointed to Inquire About Scholarships

If the government still handles it, please allocate the scholarship funds as soon as possible, so as not to have the same situation as last semester when the schools received the scholarship funds, the amount received was almost negligible.

### Poor Director Died for a Living: Film Stars and Fans Mourn Together

The memorial service for Fang Peilin was held yesterday in the main hall of the Ningbo Native Association. Almost all film industry personnel, except those who remained in Hong Kong, attended. Because actresses Zhou Xuan, Bai Hong, Xi Qiuxia, Zhang Fan, Chen Juanjuan, Sha Li, Zhang Wan, Du [blank] Zhu, and Su Manyi were present, movie fans gathered upon hearing the news, and the main [hall] was extremely crowded. The conference was emceed by Yan Jun and presided over by Fei Mu. First, Zhou Xuan offered flowers on behalf of the attendees, and then Fei Mu requested that all the people who love film art present unanimously observe a moment of silence to express their grief, and they all rose in response. Subsequently, Fei Mu, Ren Jinping, Luo Xuelian, and Zhou Boxun delivered speeches respectively and reported on Fang's life. Fei emphasized that Fang's death was not due to fleeing, but for art and for life. The film industry should mourn the loss of a loyal worker, and the audience should sympathize with a poor artist who died tragically in the pursuit of life. Zhou Boxun had collaborated with Fang in his last work, the film "United Hearts," so his speech was particularly poignant. He said that in the years before and after the victory, many people in the film industry had died tragically, the reason for which was nothing more than "poverty" and "illness." Before the accident, Fang often rushed between Shanghai and Hong Kong for filming, busy for life. This time, unfortunately, he suffered a tragic accident. He called on the attendees not only to mourn the deceased but also to cherish the living so that everyone could contribute to the development of the Chinese film industry in their remaining years.

Four Methods Decided for Planning an Education Fund

Fang Peilin had been in the film industry for decades and was famous for his set design. In recent years, he has changed from a famous set designer to a director. His works are rich in artistic atmosphere and are the only outstanding art director in the Chinese film industry. Because of his excellent personality, he is known as "Brother Fang" in the film industry. At yesterday's memorial service, his younger brother [blank] Ting and his orphaned children Shaoyuan, Kuanyuan, Xingyuan, and Minyuan all attended with tears in their eyes. Because Fang's financial situation was poor after his death, the film industry launched a funeral committee of 47 people. Yesterday, four methods were also decided to plan an education fund for his children: (1) Starting at 1:00 pm on the 15th of this month, all film actors will perform Peking Opera at the Tianchan Stage. (2) A large-scale concert will be held around the 20th of this month, hosted by Li Jinguang, Li Junxiang, Huang Yijun, and Chen Gexin, together with film stars Bai Guang, Bai Hong, Zhou Xuan, Xi Qiuxia, Chen Juanjuan, and Zhang Fan. (3) Fang's eight works after the victory will be screened simultaneously in eight theaters in Taishi on a scheduled basis. (4) A commemorative drama will be rehearsed and performed by people from the film and theater industries. In addition, Fang's five children have reportedly been promised by Qian Xucang of Guoqiang Middle School to study at the school free of charge until they graduate from junior high school.

### China Trust Bureau's Export Settlement of Exchange, $3 Million US Dollars Last Year

The China Trust Bureau's export materials have tried their best to export and exchange for a large amount of foreign exchange last year.

This figure was entirely obtained by supporting exporters, and does not include materials exported on behalf of the government. Among the exported materials, pig bristles and tung oil were the most numerous. The bureau is determined to strengthen this business in the current year's plan in order to benefit the balance of international payments.

### Tung Oil Increase

Yesterday's tung oil market, after opening, was pushed higher because the exchange rate of the Central Bank's deposit of gold was increased and non-financial commodity prices were rising.

The process continued to move towards a brisk path. Near noon, many old positions were sold for profit, and by the close, most still returned to the opening price.

Dragon Head fine cloth has not been sold by the spinning mill for a long time, resulting in tight spot prices in the market. Holders believe that the goods are scarce and artificially raise market prices. Therefore, market transactions cannot be carried out.

### Speculative Activities Concentrated, Daily Necessities Soar

At the end of last year, the market for daily necessities was extremely weak. Due to the winter season, the sales of daily necessities such as soap sharply decreased. At that time, the market price was roughly similar to the base price of pre-war gold and food. However, since the Lunar New Year, these commodities have been favored by general speculators. With the concentration of activities on all sides to pull up the prices, the market prices have risen sharply, and the trend of rising is quite alarming. Compared with the current market prices and the prices of gold and rice, the multiples that have risen have already exceeded one. According to people in the industry, some non-financial merchants, in view of the trend of daily necessities in the winter of the previous year, sold textiles and gold and bought soap for speculation. Although the rising trend in yesterday's market has continued for many days, it is still the object of enthusiastic pursuit by all parties. Guben increased by more than 50%, with a market price of 2,250 yuan. Few people in the actual sales are willing to cut prices below this level. Arrow knife soap was 2,200 yuan, Huang Xiangmao was 1,800 yuan, Beauty matches were 7,200 yuan, Phoenix matches were 7,000 yuan, Nanjing was 4,200 yuan, and Ningbo was 4,000 yuan.

### Tea Market Steady

Bids were raised sharply again and again. Therefore, although buyers still approached, negotiations fell into a stalemate and transactions were rare. The process revealed brilliance repeatedly, and prices continued to rise, and the foundation was also quite solid.

### Loan for Small Factories, Three Principles Determined

[Our Newspaper] The Central Bank's Discount Committee held its 21st meeting at 11:00 am yesterday. More than a dozen people, including Liu Gongyun, Xu Jiqing, Li Lixia, Zhao Dihua, Li Shuming, and Lin Chongyong, attended. Liu Gongyun chaired the meeting. In addition to reporting matters, the committee discussed the loan applications passed by the Industrial and Commercial Trade Advisory Committees last week, a total of 33 cases. The committee approved 23 industrial loan cases related to transportation, public utilities, coal mines, manufacturing, salt transportation and supervision, alcohol, steel, electrochemistry, and papermaking; 3 loan cases for export materials such as aluminum ingots, pig bristles, and tung oil; and rejected 7 cases. In addition, it is difficult for small factories in this city to apply for loans because they lack raw materials and quality pledges, and because of their small scale, it is difficult to negotiate bank acceptance. After various parties appealed to the committee, the committee submitted a detailed discussion yesterday and decided on three principles: (1) Small factories of various industries that continue to produce but have difficulty in working capital and urgently need to apply for loans can be jointly guaranteed by three companies and guaranteed by the industry association to apply for loans. (2) Small factories applying for loans do not need to be handled by banks; the application form can be sent to the relevant industry association for verification and then forwarded to the Central Bank's Discount Committee for review. (3) The Central Bank's Discount Committee will set up a small factory loan review committee, hire people from the industrial sector to participate, and be responsible for reviewing such applications. After approval, several banks will be designated to handle the loans.
