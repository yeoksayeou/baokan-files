### Standoff on the Jinpu Railway's Southern Section; Wuyi Town Becomes a Vacuum; National Army Troops on the Pinghan Railway Arrive in Xinyang as Reinforcements

[Our Puzhen Dispatch, 1st] The main force of the National Army on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway remains firmly defending the south bank of the Chuhe River. The Dongge and Xige areas on the north bank are also still garrisoned by the forward units of Hu Changqing's command. The Jianghuai Independent Brigade of the Communist army, originally stationed in Wuyi Town, withdrew northward voluntarily yesterday, and Wuyi Town has now become a vacuum. Furthermore, the National Army's Yang Gancai's unit has been transferred to a certain area outside of Nanjing for rest and reorganization, awaiting orders.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 1st] According to official sources: Yizheng city has not yet fallen. County Magistrate Zuo Zhiren is still leading his subordinate police teams, working with the National Army and naval vessels, to tenaciously defend the county seat while awaiting reinforcements. Although seven days and nights have passed, the morale of the officers and soldiers is extremely high. County Magistrate Zuo also telegraphed the provincial government: "I am determined to defend Yizheng and will never lightly abandon my responsibility for defending the territory without orders."

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The National Army in Jiangnan has completed its new deployment according to the pre-determined plan. The evacuation work of various agencies in Nanjing has also been largely completed. Therefore, the large number of train cars originally needed for military transport and the evacuation of public employees and teachers have mostly been returned to the establishment. The traffic order on the Jinghu Railway has thus gradually returned to normal. Although this area is close to the war zone, the situation remains peaceful and stable as usual, due to the strict enforcement of martial law by the Garrison Headquarters. In order to strengthen the security of the capital, Acting President Li also convened officers above the rank of company commander in the military police and police chiefs above the rank of police station chief at the Ministry of National Defense at 10:00 AM on the 1st for a speech. Zhang Yaoming, Zhang Zhen, Huang Zhenwu, Zhao Xia and others were all present.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The Guangxi troops directly under Acting President Li replaced President Chiang's central troops on the 1st in taking over the defense of the Pukou and Puzhen areas. The 13th Army Corps of the Guangxi Army, commanded by General Zhang Gan, began to enter the Pukou and Puzhen areas on the 31st to replace the 6th Army Corps of General Li Yannian. The 6th Army Corps, consisting of the 28th, 59th, and 96th Armies, has now been ordered to be stationed on the south bank of the Yangtze River. The 13th Army Corps consists of three armies, approximately 60,000 men, but so far only about 20,000 to 30,000 men have arrived at the defense line. This transfer is seen as indicating Acting President Li's determination to defend Nanjing under any circumstances. It was previously rumored that Zhang Gan would also be simultaneously appointed as the Capital Garrison Commander. According to military sources in the National Army, the Communist army seems to have abandoned its plan to directly attack Pukou-Puzhen and Nanjing. The 2nd Column of the Communist army north of Puzhen has begun to retreat northward, heading eastward towards the Grand Canal area. It is generally believed that this move by the Communist army further confirms the rumored initial attempt of the Communist army to cross the Yangtze River in the area near Yizheng or Zhenjiang, where the river is narrower and there are several small islands. According to people from Zhenjiang, the government forces have completed their deployment along the river to prepare for the Communist army's crossing, and artillery units are near the riverbank.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 1st] The situation in western Hubei, northern Hubei, and eastern Hubei is stable. Local bandits who had infiltrated near Jingmen and Dangyang have been dispersed by the National Army. There are currently no major engagements in Hubei. Furthermore, elite troops of the National Army have arrived in Xinyang as reinforcements and are currently on alert north of the city and south of Minggang.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 1st] Sources in the transportation sector: The bus service between Xinyang and Hankou on the Pinghan Railway continues to operate, and telecommunications are also functioning as usual. The number of passengers traveling south on the Yuehan Railway has slightly increased, and the order is still considered good. Navigation on the Jinghan waterways is unimpeded. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company may have a merchant ship leaving Hankou for Nanjing tomorrow. However, most of the ships of the Minsheng Company have temporarily suspended their eastward voyages and are participating in westward shipping. Currently, the small ferries between Hankou and Yichang are quite convenient.

### Yan Huiqing and Four Other Representatives' Trip to Beiping Is Not Yet Scheduled; Exchanged Opinions at Yan's Residence Yesterday

[Report from our Newspaper] Acting President Li recently came to Shanghai to invite five prominent figures in the Shanghai community – Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, Leng Yuqiu, Chen Guangfu, and Jiang Yong – in their private capacities, to go to Beiping to contact representatives from the Communist side for peace talks. Yesterday, there was no major development in this matter, so the departure date has not been set. However, Yan Huiqing invited Zhang, Leng, Chen, and Jiang to his residence yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM for tea, which lasted about an hour before dispersing. When the reporter went to visit Mr. Yan, they were having fried noodles together.

Yan's Remarks

Subsequently, Mr. Yan came out to meet the reporter and said in a peaceful tone: "There is no news at the moment. The various rumors about us are not true. The five of us met today because we have had little contact in the past. We took this opportunity to gather and there were no specific issues discussed. Everything still needs to wait for orders from Nanjing. As of now, we have no preparations, for example, an airplane is needed for the trip, which Nanjing has to prepare. Personally, I am 73 years old and have never been on a plane. I also suffer from heart disease and usually live downstairs because I'm afraid of climbing stairs and getting out of breath. So whether I am suitable for flying is a big question. But thinking that I have received many benefits from the country in my life, and this time I am running for the country, society and the people, I am obliged to do so even if I am ill. At most, I will ask a doctor to go with me."

Regarding the plan to contact the Communist Party for peace talks, Mr. Yan said: "There is nothing to talk about this at the moment. I don't know when Nanjing wants us to leave, and I don't know which representatives from the Communist Party we will be contacting in Beiping. I dare not say that this trip has the authority to represent either side, or has the authority to ask the Communist Party to appoint representatives, and the location and time to conduct comprehensive peace talks. But at least several people on this trip are people with some status in society. What we say may be listened to by some people. Therefore, we decided to explain to the Communist Party the people's hope for peace in a private capacity, and at the same time, we will try our best to tell the current sufferings of the people." Mr. Yan concluded: "The door to peace talks has been opened, and I hope this trip will make this door open wider."

Zhang's Remarks

According to Zhang Shizhao, this trip by the five people is purely a private exploration of peace. The overall plan for peace talks will have to wait for government representatives Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Huang Shaohong, Zhong Tianxin and others to fully negotiate.

It is also rumored that Leng Yuqiu is the most active in expressing his opinion on peace talks among the five people. However, according to Leng's statement to reporters yesterday: This matter was purely decided by Acting President Li. He has not yet made a final decision as to whether he will go to Beiping, so there is no way to talk about his views on peace talks.

### Hankou Peace Association Established

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 1st] The Hankou People's Peace Promotion Association was established this afternoon, and Cheng Ziju and 58 others were elected as directors, and they telegraphed Acting President Li and Mao Zedong to appeal for peace.

### De Wang Flew to Shaanxi and Then to Lanzhou

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] De Wang of Inner Mongolia left Nanjing by military plane at 1:30 PM on the 1st, flying to Shaanxi and then to Lanzhou, accompanied by more than a dozen Mongolian people and their families. De Wang came to Nanjing at the invitation of President Chiang nearly a month ago and had contact with various parties in Nanjing, but rarely expressed political opinions. When the reporter asked him at the airport on the 1st about his views on the future of Mongolia, he replied frankly, "Self-determination." This elderly man, loved by the last grassland Mongolians, did not have his national consciousness slightly affected by the suffering of his individual family. It is reported that De Wang will use the Northwest as a base to continue his work of saving the Mongolian people.

### US Senator Bridges: Criticizes the Government for Abandoning China

[United Press Washington Dispatch, 31st] Republican Senator Bridges, who has long advocated increasing aid to China, declared in the Senate on the 31st that China fought side by side with us in times of emergency, and we abandoned China, which will inevitably lead to regrets in the future. The United States has effectively handed China over to the Communist Party.

### Government's Peace Talk Delegation Ready to Depart; Nanjing People's Peace Delegation Flew to Beiping Yesterday

[Report from our Newspaper] According to Minister of Water Conservancy Zhong Tianxin (note: Zhong is one of the five representatives appointed by the government to contact the Communist Party for peace talks) yesterday: The government's peace talk representatives, Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Huang Shaohong, etc., may depart from Shanghai in the future and go to the designated location to negotiate peace talks with the Communist Party representatives. However, this matter still depends on the outcome of the trip of Shanghai's prominent figures, Yan Huiqing and others. After the Executive Yuan decided to move to Guangzhou, the next political affairs meeting will be held in Guangzhou. He himself is also scheduled to fly to Guangzhou in the next day or two. According to a report from the Central News Agency: Zhong Tianxin told reporters on the 1st: The personnel of the government's peace talk delegation's secretariat are now concentrated in Shanghai, actively carrying out preparations for future peace talks, such as collecting and sorting out various materials from past political consultations, and collecting international treaties signed by the government over the years. The delegation originally planned to bring a radio station, but if the peace talks are held in Beiping, the radio station will naturally not need to be taken along. In short, all internal affairs of the delegation have been largely prepared, and now they are only waiting for the Communist Party's reply.

[Report from our Newspaper] The rumor that Shao Lizi drafted a peace talk plan after arriving in Shanghai a few days ago was denied by authoritative sources here yesterday.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The weather in the capital was bad on the 1st, and the cloud cover was especially low in the afternoon. Shao Lizi's return to Nanjing was unsuccessful, and he is still stranded in Shanghai.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The Nanjing People's Peace Delegation representatives, Qiu Zhizhong, Wu Yuhou, Deng Jiyu, Song Guoshu, Zeng Zisheng, Wu Zhesheng, Guo Yude, Xia Yuanzhi and other eight people, and a group of news reporters, left Nanjing at 11:30 AM on the 1st by China Airlines special plane via Qingdao for Beiping. They will stay in Beiping for a week to meet with Communist Party members and cultural and educational circles in Beiping to discuss ways to seek comprehensive peace. The delegation is carrying a People's Peace Program to convey the people's fervent hopes and opinions on peace in the rear, and will bring back the Communist Party's opinions when they return.

### Zhang Zhizhong Answers Reporters' Questions in Lanzhou; There Is Still Hope for Peace; Military and Political Leaders of Gansu, Qinghai and Ningxia Gather in Lanzhou

[Central News Agency Lanzhou Dispatch, 1st] Northwest Military and Political Director General Zhang Zhizhong met with reporters this afternoon after arriving in Lanzhou and answered questions as follows: (1) Question: The Communist Party insists on punishing war criminals. Is peace already hopeless? Answer: No, it is not yet possible to say "hopeless." (2) Question: What is the future of the Northwest? Is local peace possible? Answer: The Northwest is the Northwest of China. I am the peace talk representative sent by the central government. I am willing to work hard for comprehensive peace. (3) Question: What are your views on peace? Answer: The people of the whole country want peace, and the government also wants peace. The government and the people's will is completely consistent. Even the Communist Party seems to not want peace. However, after more than 20 years of struggle between the two parties, there will inevitably be disputes and twists and turns when talking about peace. However, in order to show the sincerity of striving for genuine peace, the government should first seek to do its part. However, we must be calm and wait patiently. (4) Question: What do you think of the international situation? Answer: The international situation is trending towards coordination. Judging from the trend of international coordination, the future of China is also optimistic. (5) Is there any change in the military and political situation in the Northwest? Answer: No. (6) Question: What is the current situation in Xinjiang? Answer: The situation of peaceful unification and democracy in Xinjiang is constantly progressing.

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 1st] With the return of "Peace General" Zhang Zhizhong to Lanzhou, the military and political leaders of Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia have all gathered in Lanzhou. It is generally believed that the meetings in the past few days will determine the fate of war and peace in the Northwest.

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 1st] Zhang Zhizhong hosted a banquet for Ma Bufang, Ma Hongkui, and local leaders, as well as more than 100 representatives from the Lanzhou Supervisory Committee and public opinion organizations on the evening of the 1st.

[Our Xining Dispatch, 1st] De Genjia Ruo (a respectful title for Tibetan headmen) representative Guan Jia Cai Shi Duo and other seven people from Xikang arrived here and paid a visit to the authorities.

### Gan Jihou Talks About Hope for Peace

[Report from our Newspaper] Professor Gan Jihou, Acting President Li's personal representative, told reporters who visited him on the 1st: Peace is possible, because after the Communist Party put forward the eight conditions for peace talks, the government has also agreed to conduct peace talks based on these eight conditions. Acting President Li's personal representatives have had several informal contacts with the Communist Party in Beiping, and the process has been quite satisfactory. Therefore, based on these signs, peace is indeed hopeful. Mr. Gan also said: At present, the government's efforts for peace are very sincere, so it also hopes that the Communist Party will also be sincere. He does not understand why the Communist Party cannot be sincere, because the Communist Party has always called for peace for more than 20 years in the past.

At this point, a reporter asked, during the peace talks, if the Communist Party implements the crossing of the Yangtze River, would it be a sign of insincerity towards peace? Mr. Gan replied: Yes. However, he then quoted a certain military observer's view on crossing the river, believing that according to the current situation, the Communist army will not be able to complete the crossing of the river within two months. The strength of the Communist army in the area south of the Yellow River and north of the Yangtze River is not strong after a long period of and multiple wars. Because General Fu Zuoyi still holds 200,000 troops in the North China area, Lin Biao's army cannot go south for a while. Even if they go south, it will still take three or four weeks of preparation to gather a large number of arms, boats, and vehicles for a forced crossing. The main force for crossing the river must be at least 300,000 troops. However, the number and equipment of the National Army in Jiangnan are considerable. If they can defend firmly, it will not be easy for the Communist Party to cross the river. He then cited a historical proof, roughly stating that 50 years ago, Sun Chuanfang led several times as many troops to cross the river and invade Nanjing, but at that time, Acting President Li only used one army to kill Sun's army. Using the past as an example for the present, if the defending troops in Jiangnan are determined to defend firmly, history may not be difficult to repeat.

Regarding the issue of moving the capital, Mr. Gan believes that regardless of whether peace is hopeful, the government has to take contingency measures, so the government decided to move to Guangzhou. However, in his personal opinion, he believes that it is too early for the government to move the capital at this time. He also guarantees that Acting President Li will not leave Nanjing and may stay in Nanjing forever. Other heads of government ministries and commissions will need to travel between Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou in the future depending on the needs of their positions. Therefore, even if the Executive Yuan moves to Guangzhou, and Acting President Li still stays in Nanjing, according to the president being the representative of the government, it can also be said that the government is still in Nanjing.

### The Communist Army Around Taiyuan Is About to Launch an Offensive Again; Military Officials Point Out Various Signs

[Central News Agency Taiyuan Dispatch, 1st] The Communist army around Taiyuan may launch its seventh offensive within the week. This was stated by military officials here to reporters today. The officials pointed out various signs that the Communist army may launch an offensive, stating: After the Communist army's disastrous defeat in the sixth offensive in early December of last year, they immediately transferred the soldiers captured in Jinan and the militiamen from various counties in central Shanxi to the vicinity of Taiyuan to replenish their depleted troops, and after a month of reorganization, they have now completed their work. Furthermore, their offensive engineering work has been completed, the Communist army in various areas has increased significantly in recent days, and there is frequent mobilization and transportation. They have also collected a large number of ancestral frames and ladder materials from various counties, and released some captured officers and soldiers to arrange internal responses and launch rumor offensives. Furthermore, the Communist army has repeatedly used artillery fire to test the waters, and the signs of their launching an offensive are becoming increasingly obvious. He continued, although the Communist army is using the current peace talk situation to launch a fierce offensive against Taiyuan to assist in their political conspiracy, we dare to assert that we have the confidence to win, and the Communist army's invasion will suffer a more severe defeat than the previous six times.

### Establishment of Joint Organizations in Beiping; Communist Security Teams Continue to Enter the City

[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 1st] The Beiping Joint Office was officially established today, and people are generally concerned about the future movements of the organization. Chairman Ye Jianying and the other three representatives are reported to have entered the city and are waiting to take office. Various public groups are busy preparing for celebrations, and newspapers have changed the name of the Communist army to "People's Liberation Army," while the former National Army is called the "Kuomintang Bandit Army." Those who know Russian have posted notices at the door to recruit students, opening a Russian language training class. The Huabei Daily published an advertisement for the sale of "New Russian Grammar." Censorship of telegrams has been lifted, and it is impossible to predict whether it will be restored in the future. It is rumored that Fu Zuoyi's Bandit Suppression Headquarters has been disbanded, and some newspapers have begun to call him Mr. Fu.

[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 1st] Another 5,000 Communist security team members entered the city today. Today is the fourth day of the New Year, and shops have not yet opened. The New Year atmosphere is still strong. The Forbidden City, Dongjiaominxiang, the airport, and other places have been taken over by the Communist side. Government troops are leaving the city in a steady stream, and students continue to parade and rally to welcome the Communist army.

[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 1st] As of 5:00 PM today, the Communist authorities here have not yet stipulated the exchange rate between People's Bank banknotes and gold yuan coupons. The black market price is one to thirteen.

[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 1st] After entering the city yesterday, the Communist army took over the Hebei Provincial Government and other party and government agencies, such as the Beiping branch of the Central News Agency, the Beiping Radio Station, and the Kuomintang-sponsored Huabei Daily. The Catholic-sponsored Yishi Daily has voluntarily ceased publication. The personnel of Fu Zuoyi's headquarters have been reduced to only one-tenth of the original number, and the office has moved to the new Beiping area built by the Japanese in the west. It is rumored that Mr. Fu himself is also there. The Communist army did not cause any trouble after entering the city yesterday. As soon as they entered the city, they stood guard outside the gates of various agencies. The Beiping Joint Office is located in the former Japanese Embassy in Dongjiaominxiang, and the Communist representatives are also staying there. Communist soldiers are seen singing in groups on the streets, and curious crowds are watching and cheering. The Communist army and the government army are very friendly. The Communist soldiers and the former government soldiers who are standing guard in front of the Joint Office have no ill will towards each other, and both sides salute each other before greeting each other. At dusk, a group of students paraded in the streets, holding flags welcoming the Communist army, and carrying huge portraits of Mao Zedong and Zhu De. The slogans they shouted included "Down with unequal treaties." According to reliable sources, the number of Communist soldiers entering the city is about two columns, about 20,000 people. The command of the Beiping Garrison Command has been transferred to the Communist army, and Communist officers are meeting with former government army officers at Fu Zuoyi's headquarters. The Communist army's entry into the city was sudden, so the general public, especially the students, were surprised. Several foreign reporters tried to take pictures of the Communist army entering the city, but were stopped by the political workers of the Communist army. Government troops in prison uniforms were still standing guard at many intersections, blocking traffic to allow the Communist army troops to pass. A group of government officials took several trucks and were sent to Xizhimen to welcome the Communist army, shouting slogans such as "Long live the People's Army," but some seemed a little embarrassed. A certain film company of the government obtained permission from the Communist army to film the Communist army entering the city. Another truck was carrying Communist propaganda personnel, taking pictures at any time. Occasionally, female soldiers in full military uniform in the Communist army attracted even more attention.

[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 1st] A large truck of the Communist Propaganda Team drove slowly along the street on the morning of the 1st, followed by a band. Propaganda personnel distributed leaflets to the people. The trucks often stopped at intersections, and men and women in blue and white clothes got out of the car and danced for more than ten minutes to entertain the crowd.

Communist political cadres have rapidly taken over Kuomintang propaganda agencies, including radio stations and the former Kuomintang newspaper Huabei Daily. The newspaper will resume publication on the 2nd, renamed People's Daily. All other newspapers continue to publish as usual, but most of their news is now very pro-Communist.

### Fan Changjiang Appointed Editor-in-Chief of Huabei Daily in Beiping

[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 1st] After the Communist army took over Huabei Daily yesterday, they appointed the famous leftist writer Fan Changjiang as the editor-in-chief today.

### Telegrams from the Presidents of the Legislative and Control Yuans to Sun Ke Suggesting Important Leaders Gather in the Capital to Jointly Plan for the Benefit of Peace Talks; Sun Accompanied by Hong Lanyou Flew Back to Nanjing Yesterday Morning

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, and Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan, telegraphed Sun Ke, President of the Executive Yuan, currently in Shanghai, stating: "President Sun Zhesheng, with highest respect: Recently, the government dispatched personnel to Guangzhou as a contingency measure. However, during these peace talks, it seems appropriate for important leaders to gather in the capital to jointly plan for the benefit of the peace talks. Respectfully offering our opinion, hoping for your wise decision and a reply. Yu Youren, Tong Guanxian, early dawn."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Legislative Yuan President Tong returned to Nanjing on the 31st evening aboard Acting President Li's special plane. He was extremely busy throughout the 1st. In the morning, he went to the Yuan to handle official business, and then successively contacted more than 30 committee members remaining in Nanjing, conveying the opinions of the committee members staying in Shanghai regarding the current situation. In the afternoon, he visited Control Yuan President Yu for a long discussion. It is said that they exchanged opinions on the relocation of the two Yuans to the south. It is understood that quite a few Legislative Yuan members still reside in Nanjing and Shanghai, with most of the Kuomintang members in Shanghai. They unanimously believe that Nanjing should maintain its status as a political center to enhance people's confidence in peace and stabilize social order near the war zones. Judging from various signs, the Legislative and Control Yuans may take unified action, but it is not yet certain whether they will make any statements in the short term. Both Presidents Tong and Yu still have several days of delay in Nanjing, and the Secretaries-General of the two Yuans are also busily traveling between Nanjing and Shanghai, running errands to smooth things out. It is difficult to predict whether the third session of the Legislative Yuan will soon resume in Guangzhou.

[Our Newspaper] Sun Ke, Hong Lanyou, and others jointly took a flight back to Nanjing yesterday morning.

[Central News Agency, this city] According to sources from relevant parties, with the Executive Yuan relocating its office to Guangzhou, President Sun and Deputy Secretary-General Ni Jiongsheng will remain in Nanjing to supervise the remaining personnel of various ministries and commissions and handle affairs in Nanjing.

[United Press, Nanjing, 1st] Most of the important military and political organs of the capital have been evacuated. Only six transport planes remain at the airport in the city, and less than twelve fighter planes remain at another airport. Half a month ago, there were as many as 250. The navy has only two small warships stationed between Pukou and Nanjing. As for the army, various units are successively passing through Nanjing to the south. The city is filled with wounded soldiers and other scattered troops. The police are still on duty as usual, but it seems that most police teams are also being transferred out. A small number of personnel from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs continue to work, with most having relocated south last week. Public utilities and postal services are operating as usual.

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 1st] The Executive Yuan is scheduled to begin operations in Guangzhou on the 5th. More staff members arrived in Guangzhou today. Most senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and various embassies have arrived in Guangzhou. The address of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is set at Shamian Elementary School in Guangzhou, and the Aiqun Hotel is used as a reception location for foreign guests. The Ministry of National Defense has moved to Yantang in the suburbs of Guangzhou, and the conscription bureau has begun operations.

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 1st] The Presidential Office has partially relocated to Guangzhou and has decided to requisition part of the Zhongshan University campus as its office address.

According to Jiang, the date of the President's arrival in Guangzhou is not yet determined, but officials from various departments and bureaus under the Office will come to Guangzhou within days. Also, government personnel are flocking to Guangzhou, with the most being staff members of the Kuomintang headquarters, including Ma Chaojun, Chen Qingyun, Gu Zhengding, and Xiao Tongzi. The next Central Standing Committee meeting will be held in Guangzhou.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 1st] A spokesman for the Guangdong Provincial Government recently met with a Central News Agency reporter, stating that the February 1st Hong Kong newspapers, based on an Associated Press Guangzhou dispatch of January 31st, carried Chairman Xue's remarks, the content of which did not match the facts: (1) He did not announce the independent status of the four provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Fujian, (2) He did not mention not welcoming the Nanjing government to relocate to Guangzhou, and is in fact welcoming Executive Yuan President Sun Ke to come to Guangzhou to lead.

Editorial

### Wedemeyer's Visit to Japan and the Asian Situation

The overall situation in Asia is in turmoil, and the United States' Far East policy is becoming increasingly indecisive. At this time of turbulence and uncertainty, the US government has dispatched Secretary of the Army Royal and General Wedemeyer to Japan to visit General MacArthur. According to Tokyo news, Royal and his party are scheduled to arrive in Tokyo around February 1st, and MacArthur is preparing a warm welcome and will discuss the situation in Japan with them. According to Washington news, the mission of Royal and his party to Japan is clearly due to the fact that the Communist Party is advancing steadily in China, and the United States' Asian strategic situation has been greatly affected, and they will jointly review it with MacArthur. Based on the above reports and the general situation, the United States government, at least the Army Department, deeply feels that the wildfire in Asia has reached their eyebrows, and the United States must re-examine or establish a new policy. Royal and Wedemeyer are key members of the US Army Department and planners of President Truman's Asian strategy. Their visit to Japan is a matter worthy of attention.

American foreign policy has always had a tendency to prioritize Europe over Asia. This imbalance was very blatant during the implementation of the Marshall Plan after the war, and has in fact caused some mistakes! The facts of the past two years have shown that the Marshall Plan's emphasis on Europe and neglect of Asia has not saved Europe, let alone revived Europe. On the contrary, it has lost Asia, and watched communism in Asia grow from its roots and spread. The situation in northern China and the expansion of North Korea, as well as the considerable victory of the Communist Party in the recent general election in Japan, all show that the United States' past Far East policy has been a significant failure, and the entire Asian strategic situation of the United States has been greatly changed and affected. The recent personnel adjustments in the State Department have not modified the US policy toward Asia, but the anxiety of the Army Department indicates that the entire Asian strategic situation needs to be re-examined. Although this review is considered to be overdue, if it can truly catch up, it will still be beneficial to the future world situation.

In the future, the US policy toward Asia has only three paths to follow: (1) to sit and watch the continued advance of the Communist Party in China, and even be willing to withdraw from South Korea in order to secure Japan and vigorously support Japan; (2) to coordinate with the Soviet Union, re-determine strategic concessions, and maintain a new balance of power in Asia with the Soviet Union; (3) to conditionally support the Chinese government, strengthen aid to China, and contain the development of communism. The opinions of key members of the US Army Department are more inclined to the third point, while MacArthur's opinions may tend towards the first point. It is reported that MacArthur recently submitted a recommendation to the US government, which supports the first point of view. In fact, simply securing Japan and abandoning China, withdrawing from China, will not save Asia from its crisis. General Wedemeyer knows this very well. The visit of Generals Royal and Wedemeyer to Japan this time, in addition to re-examining the Asian situation and the situation in Japan, may be to negotiate a common opinion as a guideline for the future US policy toward Asia, and this common opinion must first be related to the overall situation in China. Therefore, it is said that this meeting between Royal, MacArthur, and others, its decision and outcome, is very important to the Far East situation, especially to the development of the Chinese situation in the future.

Supporting Japan seems to be an established policy of the United States, and the psychological factor of supporting Japan is mostly to underestimate the current situation in China, which is of no help to the overall Asian policy. General MacArthur implements this policy, and he certainly wants to insist on this policy, but he also said in the past that if the situation in China deteriorates further, it will obviously weaken the position of the United States in Japan, so he has repeatedly advocated actively aiding China. In addition, General Wedemeyer is a friend of China and is familiar with the Chinese situation. He and General Royal seem to be seeking a kind of coordination and compromise with MacArthur, that is, how to quickly strengthen aid to China without hindering the established policy of supporting Japan, in order to contain the continued advance of communism in China and even in Asia. If this decision is achieved, the Asian situation may gradually change in the future, at least the current hesitant attitude will no longer exist. In any case, it is beneficial to the evolution of the current Chinese crisis.

At the same time, Congressman McClen, chairman of the Foreign Economic Cooperation Committee of the new US Congress, stated: It is time for the United States to adopt an anti-communist stance in Asia as it has done in Europe. He also clearly advocated recommending a loan of $1.5 billion to aid China, including military and economic assistance. From this, we can also see the anxious mentality of the United States towards the development of the overall situation in China. We have long said that the Chinese government's previous resistance to communism was for China and at the same time for the world. The United States cannot adopt a "wait-and-see" policy or a "withdrawal" policy. The Chinese government should also understand that seeking peace with the CCP should be limited. Peace is acceptable, but surrender is not. Because it is definitely not the will of the Chinese people to surrender the entire country to communism. Because of this, we attach great importance to the visit of Generals Royal and Wedemeyer to East Asia; in the turbulent situation in Asia, we attach great importance to the change in the US policy toward Asia, especially the change in the policy toward China.

### Nanjing Renbao Newspaper Seized Yesterday, Spokesman of Garrison Command Issues Statement

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The Nanjing Renbao newspaper here was ordered to be seized by the Capital Garrison Headquarters on the evening of the 1st. The acting editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Wang Shoushan, and the editor of the fourth edition, Li Ji, have been taken into custody. It is said that the publisher of the newspaper, Zhang Youjing, is now in Hangzhou. The Capital Garrison Headquarters decided to hold a reception for the press here at 10:30 a.m. on the 2nd to explain the process of seizing the newspaper.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Tang Enbo, Commander of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison, issued a handwritten order to Zhang Yaoming, Commander of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, on the 1st, stating that "the Nanjing Renbao newspaper is spreading rumors and causing trouble, hindering public security, and should be investigated immediately and dealt with severely according to the law."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The spokesman of the Capital Garrison Headquarters said: "The Headquarters believes that the Nanjing Renbao newspaper in this city is intentionally alienating important military and political officials. Although the Headquarters has repeatedly warned it, the newspaper not only did not accept it, but intensified its efforts. On the 1st, it published a news item without any basis stating that the Capital Police Department 'Director Huang fled and was caught by his subordinates at the airport,' which was intended to provoke police officers to oppose their superiors, thereby inciting unrest and disturbing social order. It wantonly slanders senior public security officials. Although the Headquarters cherishes public opinion, it can hardly sit idly by. Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo has issued a handwritten order to the Headquarters to seize the newspaper and arrest the rumour-mongers for strict punishment. I hope the press will share the difficulties of the times. Please be cautious about publishing any unfounded news that may affect people's hearts and hinder public security."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The Nanjing Renbao newspaper here was seized by the Capital Garrison Headquarters for publishing the following news. The original text of the news is as follows:

"Amidst the rumours that some heads of agencies in this city are embezzling funds and fleeing, Huang Zhenwu, Director of the Capital Police Department, who is maintaining local public security, also embezzled a large amount of money yesterday (31st) morning, intending to flee before everyone else. However, he was caught by his subordinates at Minggugong Airport and sent to the Garrison Headquarters for legal action because the matter was not kept secret. This is indeed another scandal amidst the evacuation. The details are recorded below: At around 8:00 a.m. yesterday morning, a large truck full of luggage was stalled in the middle of the road in front of the Jindou Furniture Store in Yanling Lane in this city. The military and police came forward to inquire due to their duties. It was only then that they learned that the luggage and other items in the truck belonged to Director Huang and were intended to be transported to Fuzhou. The driver also showed a traffic permit from the police department and spoke strongly, in an arrogant manner. The police on duty were unwilling to endure his arrogance and brought him to the police station and asked Director Huang if the driver's words were true. Unexpectedly, Huang hesitated and said that the luggage belonged to Zhou Jingren, Director of the Supervision Department of the department, and sent a trusted inspector to the station to deliberately tear up the traffic permit. He was also quite annoyed that the driver had easily revealed the Director's secret, and rewarded him with a slap in the face and released him. Although Huang disguised it in this way, his intention to flee has been widely noticed by the police, because the 10,000 yuan evacuation fee that each police officer in the city should receive is still in Huang's hands and not a penny has been issued, which is related to their livelihood, so it is no wonder that there are many doubts. Zhou Jingren, Director of the Supervision Department, was especially indignant at Huang's act of covering up and pretending that the luggage was his, so he secretly monitored Huang's whereabouts. At around 8:00 a.m. in the morning, when Huang arrived at Minggugong Airport to flee and had not yet boarded the plane, he was caught by Zhou and reported to the Garrison Headquarters, which detained him for legal action."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] At around 12:00 noon on the 1st, the Nanjing Renbao newspaper (the original site of Minsheng Daily) on Zhongzheng Road in this city was attacked by more than 20 people wearing blue-gray coats and black Zhongshan suits, who smashed all the light bulbs, telephones, door and window glass, furniture, and sundries inside. The bedroom of Cheng Shewo, President of Shijie Daily, was also affected, but no one was injured.

### Across Regions, Commodity Prices Soar; Crackdown on Price Gouging in Wuhan Leads to Improvement

Yuan silver dollars are at 980 yuan each. The sound of bargaining in the streets is constant, and trading is extremely brisk.

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 1st] The Nanchang market, just after the Spring Festival, only hears of rising prices. Today's prices are generally 30% to 100% higher than on New Year's Eve.

A full-sized newspaper costs 700 yuan per month, and a quarto-sized one costs 560 yuan.

[Our Changsha Dispatch, 1st] As Wuhan intensifies its evacuation, the Yuehan Railway is extremely congested, and rumors abound. The rise in the price of silver dollars has become even more severe after the new year, with quotations above 1,000 yuan. All shops are conducting transactions in silver dollars, and in the evening, they are closing and refusing to accept gold yuan, leaving people in a state of anxiety and unease.

[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 1st] During the Spring Festival in Chengdu, commodity prices skyrocketed.

### Stalin Shows a New Attitude of Peace; US Hopes for Factual Demonstrations; Lie Suggests UN Headquarters as Meeting Place for US and Soviet Leaders

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 31st] President Truman today met with Secretary of State Acheson to discuss the questions raised by American reporters to Stalin, lasting for forty minutes. No statement was released by the White House after the meeting.

[Associated Press, Washington, 31st] The United States needs to consider Stalin's new peace overtures carefully before responding. Today, it was heard that an idea is under consideration, the content of which is to use this peace meeting to conduct a comprehensive review of the history of Soviet postwar negotiations with Western countries, and then re-request Moscow to provide concrete evidence proving that this action is indeed out of sincerity. White House Press Secretary Ross told reporters that President Truman still maintains his previously published statement, that he is ready to meet with Stalin in Washington at any time, but has no opinion to express at present. It was also heard from officials here in private that the United States now has a new Congress, Secretary of State Acheson is also a new face, and President Truman's new term has just begun. Under this completely new situation, Stalin has this new posture, and we should be especially careful to clarify the US government's attitude towards the Soviet Union, so as not to offend Congress and other aspects of peaceful sentiment. Some people also suspect that Stalin's indication at this time is still for propaganda purposes, and not to explore the US attitude towards the abandonment of suspicion and reconciliation between the East and West.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 31st] UN Secretary-General Lie said today that if President Truman and Premier Stalin are willing to meet, he intends to provide the United Nations' facilities in the United States or Europe for the two politicians to use as a meeting place.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 31st] Various circles of the United Nations are discussing today the possibility of Secretary-General Lie's suggestion to Truman and Stalin to use Lake Success as a meeting place, or at least the United Nations will sincerely exert its efforts to facilitate this meeting. Some observers point out that Stalin may have fewer objections to Lake Success as a meeting place than to going to Washington, because the UN headquarters is in an international position, which is easier to guarantee security. Lie has so far refused to express any opinion on his own will, but it is understood that Lie will discuss this matter with experts and diplomats in the next few days, and study how he should take advantage of this special opportunity if Stalin's answer can be taken at face value. Some observers in the United Nations believe that Lie can now invoke the Mexican proposal unanimously passed at the UN General Assembly in Paris before, which called on the great powers to redouble their efforts to resolve their differences, so as to lay the foundation for lasting peace.

### Royal Arrives in Tokyo; Generals of US Military Advisory Group to China Will Report to Royal on the Situation in China

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 1st] US Secretary of the Army Royal and his party arrived here from Alaska this afternoon. MacArthur and other senior generals welcomed them at the airport. Royal went to the US Embassy after getting off the plane.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 31st, United Press] State Department officials said: Secretary of the Army Royal's mission to Japan has nothing to do with the victory of the Japanese Communist Party in the Japanese elections. Observers believe that although Royal does not intend to go to China on this trip, some generals of the US Military Advisory Group to China, who recently withdrew from China to Japan, will explain the situation in China to Royal and Wedemeyer.

### It is Reported that Royal Once Advocated that the US Should Control Japan Independently

MacArthur Vigorously Opposed This Plan

[Associated Press, Chicago, 1st] The Daily News' Washington special dispatch yesterday strongly stated that Secretary of the Army Royal's trip to Japan was to force MacArthur to agree to a plan to deprive other countries related to the Pacific of their right to speak on the occupation of Japan. Royal advocated establishing Japan as an anti-Soviet base in the Pacific, stopping the American-style reforms, and restoring Japan to its pre-war state. If this plan is implemented, MacArthur will be relieved of his title as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Far East and will only serve as Commander of the US Forces in the Far East. From then on, the instructions given to MacArthur by the US government will not need to be discussed by the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission. It is heard that MacArthur strongly opposed this plan, and the two sides may have a showdown.

### Nordic Defense Issue; Three Countries Dream Different Dreams

[Associated Press, Copenhagen, 1st] The attitude of the three Scandinavian countries towards the North Atlantic Alliance can be decided within ten days.

The Danish Parliament will also launch a debate on foreign policy next week. The Farmers' Party and the Conservative Party in the Parliament are in favor of joining the West. The Norwegian foreign policy debate may affect Denmark's attitude, and Denmark is also somewhat dependent on Sweden's attitude.

[Our Newspaper News] Washington, 1st Broadcasting: State Department Spokesman McDermott stated that the United States hopes to soon meet with Norway and other countries and consult with them on whether they are willing to join the proposed North Atlantic Treaty.

### Vyshinsky's Whereabouts are Mysterious

[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 31st] The Czech Foreign Ministry remains silent today on the rumors that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky is currently residing in a hotel in Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic. According to the hotel, it has always been a gathering place for Red Army officers on vacation. Since the Soviet army withdrew from Czechoslovakia, prominent Soviet figures often reside in it. Vyshinsky himself often rests there for several days when he passes through the Czech Republic on his way back home from London or Paris, and sometimes he brings his wife and daughter with him.

[Agence France-Presse, Warsaw, 31st] A Polish government spokesman today denied rumors that Deputy Prime Minister Chaiwadiki or Prime Minister's Secretary-General Yuan Erman had gone to other countries to attend meetings with Vyshinsky or other Soviet leaders.

### President Truman Simultaneously Announces; Recognition of Israel and Jordan; Israeli Prime Minister Expresses Willingness to Maintain Friendly Relations with the US and Soviet Union

[Central News Agency, Washington, 31st, United Press] President Truman announced today the de jure recognition of Israel and its neighboring country, Transjordan. This action, which the two countries have been looking forward to for a long time, was realized immediately after Israel officially announced the results of its first election. The United Kingdom and several Western European countries have already recognized Israel de facto or temporarily last week. Truman's simultaneous recognition of Israel and Transjordan may be to reduce the dissatisfaction of Arab countries. Due to the strategic oil reserves in the Near East, the United States was forced to take a middle course in the dispute between Israel and its neighboring countries at one point in the past. Israel and Arab countries want to reach a permanent agreement to stop the bloodshed and war in the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations. The full recognition of Israel by the United States can also be expected to increase Israel's chances of joining the United Nations.

[Agence France-Presse, Tel Aviv, 31st] Israeli Prime Minister Gurion made his first broadcast speech after the general election tonight, saying that Israel's foreign policy will be based on maintaining friendly relations with the United States and the Soviet Union. The Jewish-Arab alliance is dedicated to supporting the United Nations and promoting world peace. The internal policy of the party (Socialist Party) will be based on the principle that men and women, people and all nationalities and religions enjoy equal rights. As for the government's economic plan, it will focus on immigration and colonization of barren lands.

### Small UN General Assembly Opens; Soviet Group Does Not Participate

Sha Hope Zhu, a representative of Turkey who was elected Chairman, hoped that countries participating in the Assembly could join as soon as possible, and this statement was obviously directed at the Soviet group.

### Progress in US Atomic Energy Research; Making New Weapons of Unparalleled Power

The largest atomic manufacturing project in peacetime is now being built, with an expenditure of more than 700 million yuan.

[Our Newspaper News] The issue of tuition fees for private primary and secondary schools in the city was previously discussed by Director Li of the Education Bureau before the Lunar New Year, who gathered the principals of each school to agree on the tuition fees of the previous semester converted into food rice as the standard. High school is about two "shi" two "dou" five "sheng" to three "shi", junior high school is about one "shi" seven "dou" five "sheng" to two "shi" five "dou", and primary school is about seven "dou" five "sheng" to one "shi" five "dou". At that time, the price of food rice was 1,500 yuan per "shi". Until the opening of the new year, the price of rice skyrocketed, and now it has reached about 6,000 yuan per "shi". Most parents are unable to afford this expensive tuition fee. In addition, the situation is chaotic, and many parents are considering temporarily dropping their children out of school, which will affect the maintenance of the school. Director Li of the Education Bureau, in view of these difficulties, specially sent a letter to Secretary-General Xiang of the Municipal Council yesterday, requesting to choose a date to invite all councilors to discuss how to solve the problem. In addition, the issue of tuition fees for municipal primary and secondary schools will be discussed by the principals of the city tomorrow afternoon.

### Professors' Associations of Two National Universities; Jointly Send Telegram Calling for Improved Treatment; and Request the Issuance of Three Months of Contingency Expenses and Food Storage Fees

[Our Newspaper News] The Professors' Associations of National Jiaotong University and Fudan University jointly sent a telegram to the government a few days ago, calling for improved treatment and the issuance of three months of contingency expenses and food storage fees. The telegram is as follows:

Acting President Li, President Sun of the Executive Yuan, and Acting Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education: We are teaching in Shanghai and living a poor life. Recently, we have seen that current commodity prices have risen more than a hundred times since the price limit of August 19, while our treatment is only 15 times the base salary. If converted according to today's silver coin market price, the highest treatment among us is only 45 yuan per month. Therefore, income and expenditure cannot be balanced, and life is on the verge of desperation. Moreover, the school authorities' regular expenses have also reached the end of their rope, and the government will move to Guangzhou on February 5. Although Deputy Minister Tian of the Ministry of Education has promised to allocate contingency expenses for universities in Shanghai within the month, there is still no news so far. We specially send this telegram to you, in addition to appealing for a reasonable improvement in our treatment, we also request the issuance of three months of contingency expenses and three months of food storage fees, all based on the price index at the time of payment. Please advance the above items from the National Bank, guaranteed by the government, to alleviate the accumulated difficulties and ensure life. We earnestly appeal, and we hope you will listen to us. Professors' Association of National Jiaotong University, Professors' Association of National Fudan University.

As a result of the discussions, the following measures were decided upon: (1) Food: Shanghai will maintain food reserves for three months or more as a principle.

Green Train No. 275, a special evacuation train, carried personnel from the Presidential Palace southward.

When it departed from Nanjing Central Station, it was agreed with the Presidential Palace that the four first- and second-class cars on the train could not travel south on the rails and would have to be replaced with third-class cars upon arrival in Shanghai. The Railway Bureau requested the replacement of the third-class cars after the train arrived at the northern station of this city the afternoon before yesterday, and contacted the Presidential Palace personnel. At that time, they gave a vague promise, but requested that the Railway Bureau keep the cars properly protected to prevent them from being occupied by other units. The Railway Bureau thought that this issue had been resolved, but unexpectedly, at around 10:00 AM yesterday, more than one hundred people, led by a Secretary Zhu, surrounded the dispatching office and the car assignment office, insisting on having the original first- and second-class cars travel south on the rails. The Railway Bureau stated that the first- and second-class cars could absolutely not travel south on the rails. When they could not agree, a conflict immediately broke out. The head of the car assignment office, Lu Xingming, was the first to be attacked and injured. The glass, telephones, and dispatch board in the dispatching office were damaged. The matter was only resolved after personnel from the Military Transportation Office and the Railway Bureau's transportation department heard the news and rushed to mediate. The Presidential Palace personnel agreed to replace the first- and second-class cars with third-class cars as originally agreed, and the train left Shanghai southward last night.

### Second Phase of the Risen Sun Building Flood Prevention Project to Begin Within Days

[Report from this Newspaper] The first phase of the Risen Sun Building flood prevention project, from the intersection of Xizang Road and Fengyang Road to the intersection of Ningbo Road and Guizhou Road, with a total length of 222 meters of newly built ditches, was completed in its entirety in late last month after day and night work. The Flood Prevention Committee then convened a joint meeting of the engineering and finance groups the other day, chaired by Zhao Zukang, the director of the Public Works Bureau, to discuss how to proceed. Although the municipal government has allocated special funds for the second phase of the project, from the intersection of Ningbo Road and Guizhou Road to the intersection of Tianjin Road and Zhejiang Road, in order to avoid rising labor costs, the Public Works Bureau should allocate long-term workers and a portion of regularly maintained materials. It can be carried out within days, and efforts should be made to complete it within three months.

Due to the sharp price fluctuations during the first phase of the project, the funds were insufficient by more than 150,000 yuan. At the meeting, committee member Liu Xiexun stated that the four major companies, Wing On, Sincere, New World, and Sun Sun, could donate 100,000 yuan, and the remaining amount would still be raised by the Flood Prevention Committee from other major merchants to repay the loans.

### Two Sunken Ships Missing; No Results After a Full Day of Searching; Survey Vessel Remains at Sea to Continue Search

[Report from this Newspaper] After the tragic collision between the "Taiping" and "Jianyuan" ships, the Relief Committee, composed of family members of the victims from the Shanghai side, is actively handling registration matters. As of last night, the number of people who have registered has reached more than 800. At the same time, a portion of the family representatives went to the Municipal Government at noon yesterday to meet with Mayor Wu, requesting that the authorities urge the two companies to handle the aftermath. Another portion of the family representatives went to inspect the waters off the coast on the "Haichuan" ship. The ship arrived at 1:00 PM yesterday at Hangzhou Bay East, 31.32 degrees north latitude, 122.28 degrees east longitude, about 70 nautical miles from Shanghai's Half-Yangshan Island, and immediately began searching nearby. The representatives also boarded the Jin Wanlong motorized sailboat, led by the shipowner Hu Zhilong, to search the island, but the sea was calm and there was still nothing to be found by night. The ship will remain at sea to continue the search today, hoping to accurately determine the location where the Taiping and Jianyuan ships sank first.

Regarding the location of the two ships' accident, according to a public announcement from the Jianghai Customs Maritime Affairs Department, the Jianyuan sank between Baijie Mountain and Half-Yangshan Mountain, while the Taiping sank about 4.5 nautical miles southeast of the Baijie Mountain Lighthouse. As for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the day after the two ships' accident, at the request of Yixiang and Zhonglian companies, it dispatched the Min 305 ship to search the Zhoushan Islands area. According to its report submitted after returning to Shanghai: "Arrived at Daji Mountain at 8:00 PM on the 28th. Due to the darkness, it was impossible to work, so it was decided to anchor. Departed at 5:00 AM on the 29th and arrived at Baijiemen. At around 7:00 AM, the steam whistle was sounded, but there was no movement. Later, the course was changed to Franklin Reef, and a signal was made every five minutes along the way. At that time, the wind was calm and the sea was smooth, and it was just during low tide. Only fuel oil floating on the surface was seen. Later, a small sampan was seen in Baijiemen, so it turned back to inquire. According to the fishermen on the sampan: They had seen a ship sinking in the Baijiemen channel on the evening of the 27th while on land. At that time, lifeboats were lowered, and the crying of children and women could be heard. The lights were very bright, but they were affected by the receding tide, and the sampans could not rush to the landing place in Baijiemen, etc. Then, it sailed to Ba Lai Island, the lower part of the Sanxing Lighthouse Mountain, and Franklin Reef and other islands. In order to find people and floating objects, in addition to paying attention at all times, air whistles were also released, but there was still nothing. Within a distance of two or three nautical miles outside Baijiemen and near Franklin Reef, ship fuel oil was floating on the surface, and occasionally alcohol bottles and boxes could be seen. Later, on the return journey, the tide was rising, and oil stains could also be seen in the Baijiemen channel. When inspecting the navigation in various places, we saw a Jingxing boat from the customs anchoring between Half-Yangshan Mountain and Baijie Mountain, exchanging information. As a result, we learned that they were also exploring the location of the sunken ship. By 10:00 AM, all the areas that should have been inspected had been completed. On the way back to Shanghai, a hatch board was seen floating on the surface near Daji Mountain." The location of the sunken ship measured in the report is slightly different from that announced by the Customs, but based on its patrol and observations, the sunken ship may be near Baijie Mountain and Half-Yangshan Mountain. This issue is currently being carefully studied by all parties involved.

One of the robbers drew a gun and fired two shots, one hitting Ms. Hu's right leg and the other hitting her chest, penetrating her back. Ms. Hu fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. After receiving the report, the Facao Police Precinct, led by Section Chief Shi of the Criminal Division, along with Inspector Zhu Yunzhang, police officers Zhou Youtian, Li Zonglan, Zhang Jili, Chen Shanji, and Patrol Inspector Li Chengjie from the police station, drove a police vehicle to surround and search the houses. Unexpectedly, one of the robbers fired three shots first to resist arrest. The police officers also fell to the ground and returned fire several times. As a result, the robber was arrested on Lu Xina Road and a loaded gun was seized. He was immediately taken to the precinct. According to his confession, his name is Zhao Jinsheng, 33 years old, a local, residing at No. 319 Sunjiazhai, Yu Yuan Road. The precinct is currently tracking down the accomplice, whose name is Shen Jinlin.

### A Businessman Has an Affair with a Dancer; A Family Dispute Arises

[Report from this Newspaper] Zhang Yiping, a 25-year-old dancer from Ningbo, rented a residence at No. 18 Yue Shun Li, Yunnan Road. Zhang met businessman Yang Yihe at the Dahua Ballroom in 1947 while working as a dance partner, and they soon cohabited at No. 6 Qunyu Fang, Guangdong Road. The matter was discovered by Yang's legal wife, Shen Jingzhi, who found the place and found them both there. She quarreled with her husband Yang Yihe on the spot. As a result, a statement was written and handed to Shen for safekeeping, stating that he had broken off the relationship with Zhang. In fact, the relationship was still going strong. They then moved to No. 18 Yuren Li, Yunnan Road, to cohabit. It was not until October of the following year that Shen found out again and reported it to the Lao Zha Police Bureau, who arrested the two. At that time, Shen did not want her husband to be subject to criminal punishment and only ordered Zhang to write a statement as a break in the relationship. Unexpectedly, on January 28 of this year, Shen learned that they were still cohabiting and went to the address. A mutual fight broke out, and both suffered minor injuries. The police were called and taken to the Lao Zha Precinct together. The two injured women were sent to Hongren Hospital for treatment. The case file was transferred by the precinct to the District Prosecutor's Office for review.

### Group A Basketball League: Shanghai Police Clear Another Hurdle, Defeating American Marines

The Shanghai Police basketball team, formerly known as the Morning Friends, riding the momentum of their victory over Enkas in the Group A league, overcame another obstacle last night, defeating the U.S. Marine Corps Marines with a score of 60 to 49. The Shanghai Police led the entire way, playing with ease and achieving a smooth victory. Despite the American team's height advantage, it was to no avail. The halftime score was 25 to 17, with the Shanghai Police leading by four baskets. It seems the Shanghai Police will have a brilliant record in this year's league. Last night also featured two Group B matches: (1) Group C Beryl defeated the Fat Team, 46 to 43; (2) Group D Shantou team came from behind to defeat Pu Shui, 37 to 26. The game reports are as follows:

Fat Team Unable to Endure

Group B C Beryl and the Fat Team were the first to clash. Beryl's young players entered the court and immediately gained the upper hand, leading 10 to 4. The Fat Team, all veterans of the arena, pressed closely, closing the score gap. At the end of the first half, Beryl led by only one point, the score being 19 to 18. After switching sides, the two teams fought fiercely, with numerous fouls and tense play. The Fat Team relied on Dong Yangfeng's shooting to briefly take a 31 to 30 lead, but it was a fleeting moment, and they ultimately succumbed. In the end, Beryl narrowly defeated the Fat Team 46 to 43.

Pu Shui Crumbles

Following that, Group B C Shantou team and Pu Shui faced off. After the initial contact, Pu Shui appeared very active, with Sun Weixi's shooting being quite accurate, quickly leading 6 to 0. Shantou called a timeout, but changing players was ineffective, and they lost another point. Subsequently, Shantou changed their strategy, playing a steady offense and careful defense, gradually closing the gap, initially tying at 9 each, and then taking the lead for the first time at 11 to 10. Pu Shui was unwilling to concede and responded, ending the first half tied at 15, with no clear winner. At the start of the second half, Shantou reversed their lackluster performance from the first half, with Chen Mingyi, Luo Shaoqiong, and others scoring frequently, taking a 24 to 15 lead and maintaining it throughout. Pu Shui tried to catch up but could not, the difference remaining around five or six points. By the end of the match, Shantou defeated Pu Shui 37 to 26.

Shanghai Police Take the Lead

Finally, in the Group A match, the Shanghai Police faced the Marines. As the two teams began to clash, He Zeng scored on a free throw, opening the scoring for the Shanghai Police. Goffins reached in with his long arms, and Rong Sheng responded. The Shanghai Police led throughout, and the Marines called a timeout at 7 to 4. Reese made a free throw, and He Zeng scored again. After 10 to 7, Bo Wen and He Zeng transported the ball and scored under the basket. The foreign team called another timeout, with the score at 14 to 7, a difference of half. The foreign team conferred closely and used high passes, which the Shanghai Police found difficult to intercept, allowing the foreign team to score four points. However, the police team quickly improved, with Bo Wen, Qi Xia, Jiu Quan, and Yong Biao all scoring successfully, but the Marines suffered more losses than gains. At the end of the first half, the Shanghai Police led 25 to 17, with a four-basket advantage.

American Military Defeated

After the break, Jin Gui and Rong Sheng of the Shanghai Police replaced Wang Bo Wen and Fu Qi Xia, while Reese of the Marines was replaced by Lyme Shan. The Shanghai Police performed exceptionally well. Jin Gui dismounted and exerted his power, and O'Ungate immediately responded. The Shanghai Police called a timeout, but could not blunt their momentum. O'Ungate scored twice, and Jockson committed a foul, allowing He Zeng to score a free throw. Reese scored, and the police team called a timeout. Reese scored again, and Rong Sheng and Yong Ke scored three points with a shot and a free throw, making it 31 to 25. After that, both sides scored, forming a seesaw battle. The Shanghai Police appeared active again, and the score went from 54 to 48. Shi Jiuquan and Yong Biao made three out of three shots, making it 60 to 48. As time expired, the Marines lost to the Shanghai Police.

Two or Three Things After Chen Bulei's Death  Jun Mo

[Our newspaper Nanjing Fast News, 1st] After Mr. Chen Bulei passed away in Nanjing on November 13th of last year, his remains were buried on December 10th north of Xu Village, Jiuxi Shiba Jian in Hangzhou, on a small mountain in Fan Village Tea Pavilion Lao. The location faces the mountains and overlooks the river, with quiet scenery. Hangzhou was a place that Mr. Chen often visited during his lifetime. Besides his hometown of Cixi, Hangzhou may have been his favorite place. He studied in Hangzhou in his early years and later served as the Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education for quite some time. Because he loved the fresh and beautiful scenery of Hangzhou, he and his friends jointly purchased six acres of mountain land, which is where he is buried today. At the time, he originally intended to retire from political affairs when he was old and weak, and live in the mountains, building a few simple bungalows to read and write, to spend his remaining years. Unexpectedly, the country is in such difficulty, and this hope has never been fulfilled. However, the few acres of land he bought were not very suitable as a residence, because it was too far from the city and transportation was very inconvenient, but as a burial site, whether it is an expert Feng Shui master or an ordinary passerby, they all feel that this is a good place. Because it is high and refreshing, with undulating mountains behind it, and an endless view in front, the Qiantang River is like a belt, winding at its feet, and the atmosphere is indeed majestic with a touch of charm. The construction of the tomb has been accelerated by the engineering division of the funeral committee, and it has been largely completed, leaving only the tombstone and epitaph to be engraved. The tombstone will be inscribed by Qian Taixi, in accordance with Mr. Chen's lifelong ambition of indifference, with only "The Tomb of Mr. Chen Bulei" inscribed, without listing any official titles. The epitaph will be written by Chen Zhiting, and will be completed soon. From then on, this perfect person in spirit will be buried here, adding another place to the scenic spots of the lake and mountains for people to remember and mourn.

Mr. Chen's family is now organizing Mr. Chen's diaries, manuscripts, letters, calligraphy, etc., preparing to publish them in succession. The "Memoirs" written by Mr. Chen himself during his lifetime has already been published. This is a chronological autobiography, from his birth to the age of fifty (1939). As for the ten years from the age of fifty to his death, because it has not been written into the memoirs, it can only be supplemented by the diary. This memoir records various matters of his family, his study experience, his dedication to the news industry, and his subsequent entry into politics. Many things in it have never been known to the outside world. For those who study modern history, it is certainly an important document. For those who study Mr. Chen's character and personality, this is also the most direct and reliable information. The book is published by the Twentieth Century Publishing House, and all are exquisitely printed in photogravure to preserve the original handwriting.

After the "Memoirs", the diaries and manuscripts have also been organized, but the letters are difficult to collect and will be difficult to publish in the short term. Mr. Chen kept a diary every day, without interruption for many years. Because he had severe insomnia, he could not fall asleep every night without taking sleeping pills, and the amount of medicine he took every night was also recorded in his diary. Therefore, these diaries contain the ups and downs of political tides, the understanding of career and life, and the narration of trivial matters around him. Once sorted out, they can be published. As for the submission of manuscripts, during the Northern Expedition's sweep of the north and south, the text of "Weilei" can be said to be known to women and children. Once an article was published, it was recited by tens of thousands of people. The commentaries he wrote in Tianduo Daily, Shangbao, and Shishi Xinbao have all been cut and pasted into albums. During his lifetime, Mr. Chen used his spare time to select these articles himself. Now he will compile and publish some of the articles he selected himself. In this way, his words will be as immortal as his personality in the world.

Some people in the Hong Kong press, in order to commemorate this veteran fighter in the press, and to develop the news industry in South China and Southeast Asia, and to cultivate foreign news talents, have launched the establishment of the "Bugong News Academy" in Hong Kong, which is actively preparing and will soon be enrolling students. The school building of Cixi Middle School in Mr. Chen's hometown was initiated and raised by Mr. Chen last year, and it was also completed on New Year's Day.

After Mr. Chen's death, the President issued a commendation order, saying that he "adheres to the principles of Tao, is loyal to the country, respects himself, and is conscientious in handling finances, and is a role model for human ethics." However, the press feels that they have lost a kind, amiable, and tireless elder, and the people have lost a public servant who is willing to endure hardships for the people day and night. His deeds are to be submitted to the National History Museum. The Biography of Chen Bulei in the National History has been drafted by Sha Menghai (Wenruo), a famous ancient writer from Yin County. The content is recorded as follows:

Chen Bulei, originally named Xunen, courtesy name Yanji, was from Cixi, Zhejiang. The Chen brothers were famous for their literature. His elder brother Huai was good at poetry and classical prose, and eventually became the Speaker of the Zhejiang Provisional Senate. He has his own biography. Bulei was fourteen years old when he took the government examination. The governor Yu Zhaofan specially appreciated him and placed him first. The following year, he was admitted to the county school. Soon, he graduated from Zhejiang Higher School. His writing initially followed Yang Minzeng and Feng Hui from the same county, and then he extensively read the works of famous Chinese and Western jurists. He was especially good at political commentary. In the third year of the Qing Xuantong reign, he and Dai Chuan, from Wuxing, were young men in charge of the commentary of the Tianduo Daily, and their reputation was sensational for a time. When Wuchang launched the uprising, Shanghai newspapers still did not dare to publicly advocate revolution. Bulei was the first to write ten articles about Hubei to promote it. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, he was the chief editor of the Shangbao. When the Kuomintang was reorganized and the National Revolutionary Army launched the Northern Expedition, the Shangbao was not run by the party. It spoke out for justice, creating theories to attack the Northern Warlords in response to the National Revolution. The power of its pen was almost as great as that of the military. Later, he became the chief editor of the Shishi Xinbao. When Japan invaded Jinan, Bulei immediately revealed the meaning of punishing the violent Japanese. Then he said: Is it appropriate to declare war on foreign countries before the country is unified? So he changed his words, urging the people of the country to endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens to complete the unification. Later, the government secretly issued propaganda policies, which were in complete agreement with Bulei's suggestions. When President Chiang Kai-shek of today went to Nanchang for the Northern Expedition, he immediately asked Bulei to join the Kuomintang. After Zhejiang was settled, he was appointed as the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, then as the Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, and served two terms as the Director of the Zhejiang Department of Education, one term as the Permanent Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education, and Vice Minister of Political Affairs, and concurrently as the Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department. In 1934, he began to participate in Chiang Kai-shek's government, serving as the Chairman of the Design Committee of the Nanchang Headquarters, and later as the Director of the Second Department of the Adjutant's Office. Japan was plotting against us urgently, and our government was superficially dealing with them while secretly preparing for war. Bulei wrote a poem "Enemy or Friend," clarifying that China must not succumb, and Japan must consider the security of East Asia, so that the public opinion in Japan, which was hesitant and without a master, would be vigilant. He published it under a pseudonym, and Japanese newspapers competed to translate and publish it. Those who plotted to invade us were dismayed to see it, and suspected that the article was authorized by our government. During the Anti-Japanese War, Chiang Kai-shek personally took charge of the party, government, and military, and had been in a pivotal position for a long time. He gained his exclusive trust, and they were always consistent. Bulei was regarded as the number one person to work with and achieve success. Bulei was also cautious and self-aware, not boasting about his achievements, not talking about his salary, and all his reports were based on public loyalty. He offered what was possible and rejected what was not, and did not choose what was beneficial to himself. Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly wanted to expand the duties of the Adjutant's Office, saying: "So-and-so, you can also handle it." Bulei always refused, saying: "There is already someone in charge." Internal and external high-ranking officials had difficulties that they could not ask for themselves. He must secretly and earnestly report them without letting them be heard outside. Those who had accumulated disagreements, he always mediated between them, without making accusations. He entered and exited the government offices silently and rarely spoke negatively, seemingly doing nothing, but when he faced major issues, he argued and debated firmly, never willing to compromise. Chiang Kai-shek relied on him like his right and left hands. During annual meetings and major reforms, all the documents informing friendly countries, rebuking enemy countries, admonishing officials, and informing soldiers and civilians, as well as the speeches broadcasted on wireless, were mostly written by Bulei. His articles and arguments, which were expressed outwardly, were commonly seen by the world, but as for his planning in the tent, assisting in major plans, and achieving his goals without claiming his name, it was not something that outsiders could know. Bulei served in the Adjutant's Office for the longest time. In 1939, he also served as the Deputy Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council. In August 1945, Japan surrendered. In September, he resigned from the Adjutant's Office and devoted himself to the affairs of the National Defense Council. Later, he was transferred to the National Government Committee. After the implementation of constitutional government, he changed to the National Policy Advisor of the Presidential Palace, and served as the Acting Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee. He was physically weak, often ill, sensitive to things, and quick to see opportunities. Once he was committed to serving in office, he always had the people, things, country, and nation in his heart. Being in a close position, he experienced many changes. Seeing that the habits of officials were becoming increasingly lax and the norms of the country were becoming lax, he was determined to rectify them. He believed that as a staff member, he was not in a responsible position, and he did not want to overstep the authority of others. So he secretly made plans to make up for and remedy the situation, removing what was too much and what was too extreme, silently operating and gradually changing things. His perseverance was something that ordinary people could not bear. Since he knew that his strength was about to fail, he was deeply thoughtful, sad, and unable to relieve himself. In November 1948, his family went to Shanghai for business, and Bulei stayed in Nanjing alone. He calmly wrote twelve letters to Chiang Kai-shek and to his family and friends, placing them on his pillow. Then, he swallowed an excessive amount of sleeping pills and committed suicide. The next day, at noon, the servant was late to call him to wake up. He pushed open the door and entered, and realized that something was wrong. He touched him, and his breath was already gone. He was fifty-nine years old. His letter to Chiang Kai-shek said: "Since this spring, I have been stimulated by what I have seen and heard. After summer and autumn, my illness has increased day by day, and my nerves are extremely weak. I am really unable to support myself reluctantly. At this most difficult time for the party and the country, I have verified that my body and mind have no ability to serve. Rather than stealing life and occupying a position, causing you to miscalculate, thinking that there is still a subordinate who can be driven, and thus delaying official duties, it is better to frankly admit that I am incapable and end my worthless life." He also said: "Bulei's intention arose several years ago, and recently it arose between July and August. I often recite the phrase 'The cake is exhausted, and only the shame remains,' and I am depressed all day long. Han Yu said, 'The senior officials of the central government are old in their affairs, how can they know that gratitude is in vain?' As the years pass, I cannot help in times of danger. I ask myself with a clear conscience, and I really feel that there should be no grateful and lightly alive people in wartime, and this body is not one that can serve in times of danger. The days are long and I am ashamed and have nowhere to go. In the past, when you heard Ye Ju slander the words of the Premier, you put down your chopsticks and did not eat. Now, what I have heard and seen among the general people is countless rumors and slanders spread by poisonous propaganda about you. Recalling thirty-two years ago, you ordered me to pay attention to the enemy's counter-propaganda. For the past four or five years, Bulei has not made any effort to reverse this malicious propaganda. This is just one end, and there is absolutely no reason for me to forgive and protect myself. My heart is pure and upright, and I have no other selfish thoughts except loyalty to you. Now, I am filled with regret that I cannot forgive myself, and I have come to this unforgivable ending. It is out of psychological depression and is a last resort. I dare to tell you again." Bulei's death was different from that of Qu Yuan, but his will was pure and his actions were honest, pure and unblemished. Chiang Kai-shek heard the news and came to see him in person, weeping loudly over the body. He attended the funeral and memorial service several times, and provided generous compensation. His posthumous works include Weilei Chamber's Literary Collection and Memoirs. The Memoirs is his self-written chronicle of his life.

A certain military observer told reporters: Can the Communist Army grow wings to cross the Yangtze River?

[Our newspaper Zhenjiang 30th] According to a well-informed military observer here, the Yangtze River is a natural barrier, and it is absolutely impossible for the Communist army to cross the river in the short term. The Shanghai-Nanjing line should be as peaceful as ever. I hope people's hearts will be stable and don't disturb themselves. He continued: In the history of Chinese warfare since ancient times, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River have been natural barriers that military strategists can defend, and besides, the government has a strong navy and air force, which is more than enough to blockade the vast Yangtze River. On the other hand, the Communist army has no warships or planes, and it is difficult to fly across the river even with wings.

He also said: Assuming that the Communist army wants to cross the Yangtze River on a large scale, and assuming that fifty people ride on a large civilian boat, then at least a thousand civilian boats are needed, and now the Yangtze River coast has long been blockaded. Where do so many boats come from? Taking a step back: Even if there are a thousand boats carrying a large number of Communist troops south, and the "northwest wind" helps, blowing across the river overnight, the Shanghai-Nanjing area is also heavily guarded by troops and artillery, and the sea and air are patrolling and monitoring. How would the Communist Party dare to take such a big risk to cross the river and die? So I think Shanghai-Nanjing can be settled, and Jiangnan can be foolproof.

British Economy in the Past Year  Ben Geng

[Our newspaper London 20th Dispatch] According to past practice, the British government usually publishes a white paper on the economic situation in March every year, on the one hand to review the situation of the past year, and on the other hand to explain the plans for the coming year. That is probably one of the best reference materials for observing the current state of the British economy. At present, this white paper has not yet been published, and some economic statistics have not yet been announced. The explanation in this article is based on what can be generally known, but it is mainly based on the recent talks of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Stafford Cripps.

Overall Balance Not Yet Achieved

Foreign trade is the main body of Britain's current economic problems. The provisional figure for exports in December last year was 145.7 million pounds, a decrease of 1.4 million pounds compared with November of the same year, but November had one more "working day" than December. If calculated by the average daily export volume, December was 3% higher than November. The deficit (i.e., import surplus) of visible trade in December was 26.5 million pounds, a decrease of 2.2 million pounds compared with November, and the lowest monthly import surplus since January 1947. The total number of exports and re-exports for the whole year, based on monthly statistics, was 10.48 billion pounds, and imports were 2.08 billion pounds. Comparing the upper and lower halves of the year, the deficit in the first half of the year was 251 million pounds, while the deficit in the second half of the year was only 181 million pounds. Comparing the quantity with the past, the export volume of the United Kingdom in 1947 was 9% higher than that in 1938. The export rate in the first half of 1948 was 30% higher than that in 1938, and it increased to 42% in the second half of the year. Comparing the value of imports and exports, in 1938, the value of exports was about 64% of the value of imports, in 1947 it was about 72%, and in 1948 it was 85% to 90%. It is obvious that foreign trade is gradually improving. But Britain's current goal seems to be to achieve the so-called "Overall Balance." The meaning of this "Overall Balance" is explained as that a country's consumption will not be more than what it produces. This kind of "balance" must be that exports are sufficient to pay for imports, and Britain has not yet been able to achieve this today.

Not only that, Britain not only needs to promote exports, but also needs to export to specific countries. These countries naturally include the countries of origin of British imports. The most important are the United States and Canada, followed by Argentina, Belgium, and Switzerland, all of which are so-called "hard currency" countries. But since the middle of 1947, only exports to Canada have improved, while exports to Belgium and Switzerland have declined slightly in recent months. Most of these countries have not banned imports, and the competition in these countries is very fierce. The method for Britain to deal with these countries, in addition to exporting to them, is to originally purchase from them, but now change to purchasing from other non-dollar countries. In 1948, imports were about one-fifth less than imports in 1938 in terms of quantity. In this reduced quantity, food, alcohol, and tobacco decreased from 47% of the total imports to 41%. On the contrary, raw materials increased from 27% of the total imports to 33%.

Worker Numbers Slightly Increased

To reduce imports and promote exports, it is necessary to increase production. The index of all industrial production in October last year was 27% higher than the monthly average in 1946. The number of "working population" is relatively stable, with 19.2 million people working in civil affairs at the end of October. In other words, the working population is limited by the absolute number of the population. Therefore, with no major changes in the working population, to increase production, it is necessary to increase the individual output of each worker. Last year, the number of workers in some important industries increased slightly. For example, the textile industry increased by 35,000 people, but it was still less than expected. It was expected that coal miners would increase by 31,000 people, but in reality only 6,000 people increased, and they were all foreigners. Although some British people also joined, the number was similar to those who left, which indicates that it is not easy to increase the number of people.

Individual Situations of Production in Various Industries

The individual situations of production in various industries last year were roughly as follows: The production of vehicles was very good. Based on the production volume of passenger cars in the first eleven months of 1948, there will be 335,000 vehicles in a year, which is 17% higher than in 1947. Commercial military vehicles were 170,000 vehicles, which is 10% higher than in 1947. The ships completed were 950,000 net tons in 1947, and exceeded 1.2 million net tons in 1948. The export target of coal has also been achieved, but the output has not reached the expected level, so between 1.5 million tons and 2 million tons of coal from inventory were used.

A Snapshot of Jiaxing  Our reporter Chen Jianxiong

Jiaxing - In this era of war and chaos, it has not been involved in the vortex of war. On the surface, it is indeed a paradise in the war. But the surface prosperity still cannot conceal the internal emptiness. After eight years of catastrophe, it is still unable to break free from the indirect impact of the war.

The economic turmoil has made the treatment of public teachers without a certain standard. The salaries they receive really make it impossible for them to live. Therefore, the primary school teachers first launched a petition, and the local newspapers also wrote articles to appeal. Finally, it was passed at the ninth conference, relieving the siege of life and distress.

The councilors are very concerned about the lives of the primary school teachers, but because they are too concerned, they made a joke. When the ninth conference decided to send representatives to the county magistrate to request that the balance of the salaries for primary school teachers from August to November be paid in full within a week, the county magistrate agreed and ordered the relevant department to rush to make the roster overnight and notify the schools to claim it. Who knew that the maximum balance salary for each teacher was only ten yuan, but the round-trip travel expenses from the countryside to the county town cost twenty or thirty yuan. Some townships were too far from the county to rush back, and there were also problems with food and accommodation, which made everyone laugh and cry.

The suffering of public teachers is not as much as the suffering of public teachers who are cultural people. When prices were at their peak, it was not enough to buy a pack of black market "white tin-wrapped" cigarettes with a month's salary. Although the editors and reporters association later invited the heads of various newspapers to request an increase, it was two times lower than that of public teachers. It is still too hopeless whether it is possible to adjust it in the future.

The public security work in Jiaxing has indeed achieved a level of ensuring safety. In recent months, not only has there not been a single case of theft, but even small cases of theft have been rarely discovered.
