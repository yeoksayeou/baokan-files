### Russell Speech: Supporting the Kuomintang is a Bad Strategy

[United Press, San Francisco, 25th] State Department Public Affairs Director Russell said at the "World Trade Week" banquet today that it would be extremely foolish for the United States to support the Chinese Kuomintang government, implying that it should quickly establish relations with the communist regime. Russell said: The Chinese people do not like foreigners, but in any case, they need a large amount of food and industrial cooperation such as machinery. The Kuomintang has collapsed. If you want to support it, you must use American military force and greater financial and economic assistance. This is tantamount to forcing a government that the Chinese people do not trust at all to obey, which will only arouse the resentment of the Chinese people. In the Chinese Civil War, the Kuomintang army had superior firepower in every major battle, and it also had an air force, but they all surrendered without fighting. The only reason is that the Kuomintang government has lost the trust of the Chinese people.

### Fundamental Problems of German Unification: Disagreement Among the Four Foreign Ministers; Soviet Union Reaffirms Demand for Restoration of Allied Control; Acheson Proposes Two Conditions for Economic Unification

[Reuters, Paris, 25th] The four foreign ministers held their third meeting today, chaired by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, to discuss the issue of German unification. The meeting lasted three and a half hours and failed to show any progress toward an agreement. The foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union each declared their general principles on German unification and attacked each other's views.

The starting point of today's meeting was the Western three powers' rejection of Vyshinsky's proposal yesterday to restore four-power control and Soviet participation in the Ruhr industrial control. Vyshinsky, speaking for the first time as chairman of the current meeting, responded to the Western three powers' rejection of his proposal yesterday, based on legal points, and reiterated his proposal to restore four-power control. US Secretary of State Acheson pointed out that there are two conditions for economic unification: (1) cessation of reparations payments from East Germany; and (2) agreement on Soviet funds in East Germany. French Foreign Minister Schuman pointed out that the four-power control system can only work if the principle that the four powers must agree unanimously is stipulated, and can only be used in exceptional circumstances. At the same time, Germans must be allowed to have extensive powers within the democratic systems of West and East Germany. Foreign Secretary Bevin also emphasized that Germans must be allowed the freedom to choose their political and economic systems. The meeting finally ended at 7:15 pm local time. Dulles, an advisor to the US delegation who attended the meeting, said afterwards that no new proposals were put forward at today's meeting, but the discussion was extremely detailed and complex, and could not be summarized in a few words.

Western Powers Shirk Responsibility for Causing German Division

[Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 26th Dispatch] According to TASS, Paris: The four foreign ministers' meeting on the 24th began to discuss the first item on the agenda, namely "the unification of Germany, including economic principles, political principles, and Allied control." British Foreign Secretary Bevin served as chairman. Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky spoke first during the discussion. Vyshinsky first elaborated on the importance of the economic and political unification of Germany and reviewed the important decisions on this issue made at the Yalta and Potsdam conferences and the 1947 Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. Subsequently, Vyshinsky discussed the activities of the German Control Commission, the German reparations issue, and the Ruhr issue. He reiterated the Soviet government's position on these issues. After listing the facts, Vyshinsky criticized the divisive measures taken by the US, British, and French governments in Germany. In order to ensure the economic and political unification of Germany, Vyshinsky put forward the following specific suggestions to the meeting: (1) Restore the activities of the German Control Commission and restore the Allied Joint Command in Berlin; (2) Establish an all-German Council of State on the basis of the existing economic commissions in the eastern and western occupied zones and restore the Berlin City Council. After Vyshinsky spoke, the foreign ministers of the United States, France, and Britain spoke in succession. US Secretary of State Acheson said that when he listened to Vyshinsky's speech, he had the hope that the foreign ministers' meeting might reach an agreement on the issue of German unification. However, Acheson's further remarks opposed the Soviet proposals and made it clear that the US delegation continued to adhere to its previous position and did not intend to eliminate the divisive activities it was carrying out in West Germany. Acheson tried to prove that the so-called denazification and elimination of militarism had been completed in West Germany, that war criminals there had been tried and punished, and that all democratic freedoms had been fully realized there. Therefore, the tasks facing Allied control in the early stages were said to have been resolved in the western occupied zone. Acheson argued that the Western countries were not responsible for the division of Germany. He said that Germany was automatically divided into separate parts, like an organ composed of separate cells. Referring to the Soviet delegation's proposals, Acheson said that the proposals "disappointed" him and that he opposed the proposal to restore the activities of the Control Commission on the former basis. He insisted that this step would cause the "recovering patient to fall back into complete paralysis." Acheson said of the Soviet proposal to establish an all-German Council of State that doing so would be a step backward, not a step forward. French Foreign Minister Schuman and British Foreign Secretary Bevin's speeches on the issue of German unification agreed with Acheson's views in some respects and were ambiguous in others.

It will thoroughly eliminate the four major families of warlords, bureaucrats, party thugs who have harmed the country and the people and committed all kinds of evil, and let the people use their own power to build an independent, free, and happy New China.

In the past, Shanghai was a colony where imperialists invaded China and a slaughterhouse where the Kuomintang reactionaries persecuted the people. In the future, it will be the people's own democratic stronghold. We must highly promote the people's revolutionary tradition of Shanghai and make the newborn Shanghai an iron army for building a new China.

We greet the new victory of the revolution and celebrate the rebirth of the people in this city and everywhere with unusual excitement and joy. However, we should not just celebrate in form and then be done with it. Everyone should further learn from the People's Liberation Army's spirit of perseverance and hard work, assist in the advancement of the revolutionary cause, and make long-term efforts to build a new Shanghai and a new China. At present, all citizens of Shanghai should carry out the following tasks together: First, do everything possible to provide the People's Liberation Army, which is fighting and resting, with material and spiritual assistance. Second, comfort all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Third, rescue and comfort the wounded and sick soldiers. Fourth, mourn the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who died in battle and the democratic martyrs who sacrificed for the revolution, and donate money to help their families. Fifth, assist the People's Liberation Army and municipal receiving personnel to restore order and prosperity in Shanghai as soon as possible. Sixth, report latent war criminals and Kuomintang secret agents, and prevent the conspiracies, sabotage, and disturbances of reactionaries. Seventh, assist the new government agencies in rescuing refugees. Eighth, assist the People's Liberation Army and political receiving personnel in implementing the Eight Main Rules of Discipline.

Let us unite: Pay tribute to the People's Liberation Army that liberated Shanghai and China! Pay tribute to the Communist Party of China and its leaders who led the New Democratic Revolution! Mourn the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who died in battle and the democratic martyrs who were martyred in various places! Eliminate the remnants of reactionaries all over the country! Strive for the comprehensive victory of the Liberation War! (Shanghai Members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy)

In addition, the members of the Shanghai Democratic National Construction Association also issued a declaration yesterday to express their enthusiasm for welcoming the People's Liberation Army. Excerpts are as follows:

Today is the glorious day when Shanghai was first liberated. In addition to celebrating wildly, the six million citizens of Shanghai should bravely and unitedly stand up to assist the People's Liberation Army in taking over the work of Greater Shanghai, and immediately mobilize the power of the city's people to complete the following most important tasks: First, we must protect the integrity of all public and private production sectors. Second, we must preserve the integrity of all public and private properties and materials. Third, we must maintain the continued operation of all public and private enterprises, institutions, schools, etc. Fourth, we must preserve accounting books and documents, assist in the takeover, and prepare for handover. Fifth, we must stabilize social order and maintain public security. Sixth, we must continue to restore production and increase output. Seventh, we must eliminate old habits, learn new lives, cherish materials, and save consumption. Eighth, we must do our best to contribute manpower and materials to support the People's Liberation Army's military affairs, and especially respect and love the soldiers and families of the People's Liberation Army, and expand condolences and assistance. Ninth, we must support the new regime of the democratic revolution and abide by the new laws of the People's Government. Tenth, we must impartially report Kuomintang spies and underground secret agents, expose their conspiracies, and destroy their organizations.

In order to effectively implement the above ten important tasks and accelerate the thorough victory of the democratic revolution, we especially call on people from all walks of life in Shanghai to actively unite and act together.

First of all, the labor compatriots of Shanghai! You are the main force of the New Democratic Revolution, and you are the backbone of the new China after liberation. You should stand on the front line without hesitation and lead the people of all classes forward.

Secondly, fellow farmers, today, in the face of the liberation of Shanghai, the revolutionary people ask you to form a strong worker-peasant alliance with the urban working masses, become a model of liberation in Jiangnan, and lay a solid foundation for the new China of New Democracy.

Shanghai's industrial and commercial entrepreneurs, the policy of New Democracy is "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital." It will help you develop your business and increase the freedom and happiness of the whole people and you under the premise of being conducive to the development of the national economy. Therefore, you are required to maintain and restore production, assist the People's Liberation Army's cause, and be revitalized without hesitation to support the victory of the democratic revolution across the country.

Shanghai's shop clerks, employees, young students, intellectuals, public teachers, soldiers, police, and citizens of other strata! Today, this great cause of the people's liberation urgently needs you to continue your glorious tradition, bravely join the revolutionary ranks, assist in the takeover, implement liberation, and take on the task of building a new China.

Finally, we would like to solemnly inform people from all friendly countries that you must change the superiority of the imperialists and abandon the attitude of bullying the weak.

Compatriots all over China! Elders, uncles, brothers and sisters of Shanghai! We hereby call on you to stand with us, gather together under the banner of the People's Revolution, abide by the leadership of the People's Liberation regime, assist in the takeover of Shanghai, support the military of the pursuing troops advancing into South China, and enable the Chinese democratic revolution to be completed quickly and peaceful construction to be realized as soon as possible.

### We Have People to Avenge Us

—Gao Shutang

[Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang-Jiangxi Front, 26th Dispatch] The victorious People's Liberation Army stepped into the old liberated areas of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi more than ten years ago, and the soldiers appeared particularly excited. Thirty miles further south is the county town of Leping. Everyone was singing when they suddenly heard a miserable cry from the roadside. The soldiers couldn't help but stop. They saw a little girl with disheveled hair crying on a coffin in a dilapidated thatched house by the roadside. A little boy next to her was crying and rolling on the ground. The two were calling out to their dead mother, and it sounded like knives were piercing their hearts. The people's soldiers couldn't help but step forward to comfort the two orphans. Suddenly, someone shouted from behind an earthen slope at the edge of the village:

"Come out! It's not Chiang Kai-shek's army. They're still singing the Three Main Rules of Discipline of the Red Army!"

So, a large group of people, men, women, old and young, emerged from behind the earthen slope and surrounded the People's Liberation Army. An old woman leading the way grabbed the soldiers as if she had seen relatives and said, "If you comrades don't come, everyone will die, and the houses will be burned down." Her surname is Huang, and the village is called Taqian Village. Yesterday, the Kuomintang bandit army's 68th Army had just fled past here. Grandma Huang pointed to the little girl on the coffin and said, "A Kuomintang platoon leader and seven or eight soldiers dragged her to the back room. Her mother, Sister Hong, desperately grabbed the platoon leader's leg and begged for mercy. The dog platoon leader turned around and shot her. Sister Hong was killed like that. The girl is only fourteen years old. She was defiled by those dog thief soldiers. Look how defiled she is!"

The little girl on the coffin had already cried herself speechless. Grandma Huang saw that her eyes were swollen and bloodshot, and her thin body was yellow and thin. She couldn't help but cry out, "My child with no one to take care of her!" and she collapsed onto the coffin and burst into tears. The little boy on the ground suddenly got up, using his two small hands to lift the coffin, and his little head pushed desperately inside, crying with a red face. At this time, Grandma Huang wiped away her tears and came over to pull the two orphans and said, "Little girl, little boy, the Red Army is here to avenge us! Listen to your aunt, don't cry, don't cry." The child cried even more sadly and lifted the coffin lid more vigorously, crying out "Mama" over and over again. The soldiers' eyes were filled with tears, and they didn't know how to comfort them, but they clenched their weapons in anger. More and more people were complaining. A twelve or thirteen-year-old child who was shot with a peach pit by the bandit army in Duchang said that he personally saw a bandit army company commander rape a woman in Lintian Village, four miles away. She refused to obey, so the dog company commander used a bayonet to dig out her left eyeball. Immediately, blood gushed out of her eye like a fountain. She was in so much pain that she bit her hair and rolled all over the ground. She rolled into the water channel, and immediately dyed the water channel red. She died in the channel after a meal's time. He Lixian, a young man from Huangmei County, Hubei, cried and accused the bandit army of raping his wife to death when they withdrew from his hometown. He sold all his land to bury his wife, but he was captured here by the conscription officers. A man from Hukou named Zhai Zu and his father were captured by the bandit army to carry ammunition. When they walked to the village to the south, his father was really unable to carry it. The bandit army tied his father and three other old men into a house and burned them alive. Another person cried that the Ma brothers, who were digging wild vegetables with him, were passing the large wooden bridge south of the village on their way home when they ran into the defeated bandit army. The bandits stabbed him off the bridge with a bayonet without asking any questions, and he was killed. There are still bloodstains on the bridge. The endless sea of ​​blood and deep hatred filled everyone present with tears. "Don't be sad!" the soldiers said briefly, "We will avenge you!"

The People's Liberation Army of the Fourth Column came from the north again. Villager Hong Minggan said: "Don't be sad, we have people to avenge us! Hurry up and get water for the comrades. I'll get food for the comrades!" Taqian Village suddenly became busy, with people boiling water, cooking, and revenge cries everywhere. "The team to avenge us is here, hurry up!" people shouted in the village, "Avenge us, comrades, arrest all those Kuomintang bandit army dogs!" People shouted on the roadside. The little girl on the coffin also came to the roadside with boiled water and pointed to the coffin to the People's Liberation Army and said, "This is my mother, comrades, avenge me!" The troops continued to advance, and everyone's pace became tighter. On the dusty road, angry songs rang out: "Chiang Kai-shek, where are you fleeing!"

Suburban residents who had taken refuge in city hotels rushed to rent cars to return home. (Our Newspaper Photo)

### All Towns in Pudong are Peaceful; Yangjing Suffered More Damage; People From Songjiang Said That the City Has Returned to Normal Long Ago

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, the reporter met a villager at the Nanmatou ferry crossing who had just walked from near Bailonggang in Pudong, passing through Xiaowan, Zhangjiangzha, Beicai and other places to Shanghai. According to him, the countryside has been extremely peaceful since liberation, and walking along the way is convenient. When the People's Liberation Army advanced north along the Qin Gongtang from Nanhui to Xiaoyingfang in the middle of this month, there was a slight contact with the Kuomintang army, and the entire Kuomintang army retreated along the Shangchuan Railway to Qingning Temple. Within a range of more than ten miles around Bailonggang, Chuansha, Gongjialu, X港, and Heqing, no major losses were suffered, the damage to houses was minimal, and even fewer villagers died. Only one or two bombs fell in Chuansha city.

[Also reported] There are ferries at Yangjiadu that can take you to Puxi (but not the municipal ferry). The market in the town is very prosperous, and the order in Dongjiadu and Dongchang Road is good. There is no damage to civilian houses, but the houses near the artillery positions have mostly been demolished by the Kuomintang army. The battle was more intense around Yangjing and Dongshi, and many houses were damaged. The No. 7 bridge behind Yangjing town was also blown up by the Kuomintang army.

### Nighttime Gunfire: Signal Shots, No Need to Panic

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the liberation of this city, sporadic gunfire has often been heard at night. These are signal shots fired by the People's Liberation Army during nighttime patrols and searches. There are no bullets involved, so citizens need not panic.

They reported that normal conditions in Songjiang city had been restored for several days. Residents were very calm during the war, and losses were minimal. The towns and villages along the way have also been extremely peaceful since liberation.

Furthermore, someone from Zhoupu reported that when the People's Liberation Army advanced to Zhoupu town, they did not encounter strong resistance. Therefore, the damage to the town and surrounding areas was not significant. However, the Pu Jian Company was set on fire and partially destroyed. Most shops have resumed business, and there were no obstacles encountered on the way to Shanghai.

### Meteorological Observatory Undamaged, Resumed Work Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] Urban public transportation gradually resumed yesterday. Tram lines 2, 4, and 10, operated by French businesses, and bus lines 21 and 22, began operating after 7:00 AM. However, the number of vehicles running was very limited. For example, trams ran approximately every several tens of minutes, resulting in extremely crowded conditions on each vehicle. Tram line 2, operated by a British business, also resumed operation, but because enemy forces were still putting up stubborn resistance on the northern bank of the Suzhou Creek east of the Sanbanqiao Bridge, and stray bullets were occasionally flying between the southern bank from Carter Road to the Bund, it only ran from Jing'an Temple to the Carter Road stop. A few trolleybuses on lines 20 and 24 were also running. City-operated bus lines did not resume yesterday, but more than thirty empty buses traveled from east to west to Fenglin Bridge in the afternoon. It is possible that they will resume operations today.

### Shanghai-Changshu-Suzhou-Wuxi Transportation: Bus Trial Runs Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] Although land and water transportation between the city and outlying areas have not yet fully recovered, during this transitional period, the Zhonghua Transportation Company plans to utilize the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway to connect Shanghai with Changshu, Suzhou, and Wuxi.

The entire journey will take approximately six hours, and it is said to be safe, but the fare is quite expensive, at seven silver dollars to Changshu, eight to Suzhou, and ten to Wuxi. The first trip will depart today as a trial run. Because the bridges along the highway cannot bear heavy loads, the vehicles used will be business cars, each carrying six passengers.

Additionally, a passenger transport company is being organized within the Huashang Hotel on North Hai Road. Starting today, they will first restore bus transportation on the Minhang-Pinghu line.

### Rice Prices Fall Back Down, Flour, Oil, and Grain All Decline

[Report from Our Newspaper] The grain market is still in a dormant state, but most retail rice shops have resumed operation. The second phase of household rice distribution for this month, which has been underway since the 23rd, is also the last day today, the 26th, in accordance with previous regulations. Because the price is not particularly cheap, many ordinary citizens have not gone to purchase it. Due to increased sources from the four suburbs, the retail price of white japonica rice has fallen back to around 300 million per shi. Other cooking oil, flour, and miscellaneous grains have also generally lowered prices and are being sold, as people's hearts have settled. Bingchuan flour has fallen to 70 to 80 million per bag, raw soybean oil is also down to 8 to 9 million per jin, and large soybeans are around 3 million per jin, a decrease of about 30% from the previous day.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday at the small vegetable market, because the source of supply was smooth and there were more vegetable vendors, prices also fell.

In the early morning, members of the Shanghai Mass Organizations United Association went to various shops to encourage them to open and resume business. Retail shops in the nearby western district, Nanshi, and along Xuhui Road began to open for business after 9:00 AM.

The storytelling venues also continued their business without interruption.

At the intersection of Béthune Road and Wenlin Road in western Shanghai, when the reporter passed by around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, it was seen that vehicles were prohibited from passing. The Bund south of Avenue Edward VII was open and unobstructed, but north of it, there were no people or vehicles. The situation in the area near the Suzhou Creek north of Beijing Road was roughly similar.

The two ferries across the river between Yangjiadu Wharf, South Wharf, and Pudong resumed operation yesterday morning, and passengers were crowded. According to visitors from Pudong, Pudong has now been completely liberated, and the countryside is also exceptionally quiet, with unobstructed roads. A large number of firewood boats from Tangkou arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and several were seen unloading at the Lujiabang Wharf.

Many ships that were forcibly sunk in the Huangpu River on the Bund when the enemy forces withdrew still have their cabins above the water surface. According to various salvage companies, these ships are not large in tonnage, and it will not be difficult to salvage them in the future.

According to workers at the Navy Shipyard in front of the Gaochang Temple, the shipyard was heavily damaged by the enemy forces, and all dock gates, power generation rooms, and faucets were destroyed. The shipyard workers have now automatically organized a security team to help protect the equipment inside.

The Minzhi Journalism Vocational School organized an independent propaganda team and work team yesterday, carrying out street propaganda in front of the gas station at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Avenue Edward VII, and leading citizens in singing Yangko songs using a megaphone. Students from other schools also organized propaganda teams to carry out mobile propaganda on the streets, and many onlookers watched.

While carrying out oral propaganda, the students of Minzhi Journalism School and others also advised shops to open for business. When some shops were not opened for a while, the students, after obtaining the consent of the shop owners, unloaded the door panels for the shops, enabling them to resume business.

People fleeing from various places to the city continued to move back in the past two days, and the large and small hotels in the central district returned to their usual state yesterday. Most of the hotel corridors no longer had mountains of boxes and luggage piled up.

### Yangko Songs Sung Everywhere on the Streets, Enthusiastically Welcoming the People's Liberation Army

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the reporter toured the western part of Shanghai and saw a long column of People's Liberation Army soldiers marching from west to east on Jing'an Temple Road. At that moment, a Yangko team arrived in front of the Guanshengyuan [confectionery] on Jing'an Temple Road. Two people raised the flags, on which was written "Welcome the People's Liberation Army." The People's Liberation Army soldiers walked under the flags, and the Yangko team sang songs, danced the Yangko dance, and shouted slogans, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. Going further west, near Zhao Feng Park, there was a large group of captured Kuomintang soldiers, wearing the "Ping" character symbol, escorted by several People's Liberation Army soldiers, marching from west to east. The prisoners looked very dejected. On the way back, passing through Yuyuan Road, I saw a large team of male and female students dancing the Yangko, wearing red stars and red flowers, and beating gongs and drums. Many passers-by were watching. Near the Paramount Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road, two large "People's Propaganda Team" trucks were parked. A large Yangko team was dancing, led by two red flags, with neat steps. This is the new people's song and dance. At the corner of Carter Road, a large group of People's Liberation Army soldiers were sitting in the corner resting. Heavy rain was pouring down, but they would rather endure the rain than enter the people's homes to rest. Their iron discipline won the praise of the citizens. When they reached the Dahua Theater, the rain was even heavier, and the students in the Yangko team were all drenched in the rain.
