### Acting President Li Receives Telegram: CCP Orders to Cease Offensive; Frontline Troops to Receive Orders Within One or Two Days; Stance on War Criminals Issue Also Relaxed

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th Dispatch] The CCP authorities have issued an order on the 10th to cease military offensives. This was clarified in a telegram Acting President Li received from Beiping at 10 p.m. on the 10th. It is reported that this order was issued by the CCP authorities on the 10th, but it will take one or two days to reach the various frontline troops. It is predicted that the continuation of the war can come to an end in the short term. This is the greatest achievement after the delegation's arrival in Beiping for the exchange of views.

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th Dispatch] Regarding the eight conditions for peace talks proposed by the CCP, the first condition, the issue of war criminals, has seen positive progress during individual contacts before the formal start of the peace talks. The CCP has agreed to relax the handling standards, so the issue of war criminals is no longer the focus of attention. Formal peace talks have not yet begun on the 10th, but according to reports from Beiping, the most important thing at present is the pre-meeting exchange of views. During this period, the eight conditions will be discussed one by one. After each condition has been agreed upon, a formal meeting will be held, and the results of the agreed-upon conditions can be signed into a peace treaty after the start of the meeting. Judging from the current situation, the peace talks may proceed smoothly.

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th Dispatch] Regarding the issue of troop reorganization in the peace talks, government military officials are continuing discussions. At 4 p.m. on the 10th, Acting President Li and Premier He convened a meeting at the Ministry of National Defense with Xu Yongchang, Gu Zhutong, Bai Chongxi, Hu Zongnan, Lin Wei, Guo Chan, and others, totaling ten people, for about two hours.

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th Dispatch] The government's decision to send high-ranking officials to Beiping to assist in the peace talks has not yet been finalized as of the 10th and is still under consideration.

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th Dispatch] The Peace Talks Guidance Committee established by the KMT Central Standing Committee will have a significant impact on peace talk decisions in the future. The committee consists of eleven members, chaired by Li Zongren. Except for Sun Ke in Guangzhou, the remaining members, including Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, He Yingqin, Tong Guanxian, Zhang Qun, Wu Zhongxin, Zhu Jiahua, and Xu Yongchang, are all in Nanjing. Wu Tiecheng flew from Guangzhou to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 10th and will arrive in Nanjing at 7 a.m. on the 11th. In fact, the above-mentioned eleven committee members had already participated in the deliberation and decision-making of the peace talks in the past. After the Central Standing Committee approved the establishment of the committee, it will follow the instructions of the Central Standing Committee, regularly study and handle all issues in the peace talks, so as to expedite matters. It is reported that the committee does not necessarily hold regular meetings. When important issues arise, all or part of the committee members will consult with each other at any time to resolve them.

[United Press, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] Government officials, after thoroughly discussing Mao Zedong's reply telegram to Acting President Li all night on the 9th, have intensified hopes for peace. A senior official commented on the concessions made by the CCP and the mild language in Mao Zedong's reply telegram, saying: This may be the CCP's "first step in a miracle of finally changing its original intention and deciding to make the Beiping negotiations a success." He said that the CCP's abandonment of the demand for an immediate crossing of the Yangtze River and the government's obligation to state its final position before April 12 has brought the KMT and the CCP somewhat closer. He said that there were two particularly encouraging points in Mao Zedong's reply telegram: first, the CCP has now agreed to limit its demands to the scope of the eight conditions; second, the CCP may concede on the deadlock over the issue of punishing war criminals. It is reported that the government's current position on the "punishment of war criminals" is only to agree to prohibit individuals listed as "war criminals" from participating in the coalition government after a peaceful resolution.

### KMT Legislative Members in Nanjing to Issue Joint Declaration; Held Secret Symposium Yesterday to Discuss the Current Situation

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th Dispatch] KMT legislative members in Nanjing held a secret symposium at 9 a.m. on the 10th at Shipo Lane to discuss party affairs reform and the current situation. More than 80 people attended, including Huang Yuren, Fan Yushui, Gan Jiaxin, Huang Tong, Qiu Changwei, Wang Qijiang, Bai Yu, Liu Butong, and Wu Hexuan. Chairman Bao Huaguo and other committee members spoke enthusiastically, exchanging opinions extensively on peace talks, party affairs reform, and the current situation. It was decided to issue a joint declaration on the current situation, stating: (1) absolute support for peace talks; (2) hope that the Executive Yuan will truly be accountable to the Legislative Yuan; (3) overthrow the powerful families, politically abolish monopoly; and (4) oppose behind-the-scenes manipulation. Huang Yuren, Bao Huaguo, Wang Menglin, and Gan Jiaxin were nominated to be responsible for drafting the declaration. In addition, it was decided to establish a joint organization, and Tu Gongshui, Qiu Changwei, Zhang Jingyu, Zou Shuwen, Chen Guyuan, and others were nominated to draft the organizational regulations, which will be submitted for discussion at the next meeting. The symposium on the 10th was initiated by Huang Yuren, Gan Jiaxin, Qiu Changwei, Huang Tong, and Fan Yushui. Those invited were mostly KMT legislators with similar views. Two meetings had been held in the past, and the 10th was the third gathering. At the meeting, Qiu Changwei first reported on the peace talks, saying that the peace talks were progressing smoothly, the issue of war criminals was expected to ease, and the Communist army would certainly not cross the Yangtze River during the peace talks. Third-party figures are now mediating, and the CCP hopes that government officials will visit Beiping. He believed that the future could be optimistic, but regardless of the success or failure of the peace talks, it was difficult to say whether the Communist army would eventually cross the river. Huang Yuren then reported on his views on party affairs reform. The committee members spoke one after another, lamenting the mistakes of party affairs in the past, saying that without thorough reform, it would be impossible to save the critical situation. The meeting adjourned at 12 noon.

### Fu Bingchang Passes Through Sweden

[Reuters, Stockholm, Sweden, 9th Dispatch] Fu Bingchang, Chinese ambassador to the Soviet Union, who arrived here on the 9th from Moscow via Helsinki, reiterated here that although he is on his way back to the country, it has not yet been decided whether to serve as foreign minister. He said: "Nanjing has not formally asked me whether I would accept the post of foreign minister. I would like to study the domestic political situation before Yuno takes office as foreign minister."

### Cheng Qian Issues Statement to Stop Absurd Rumors

Changsha Gongshang Bao Permanently Suspended

[Our Changsha Bureau, 10th Dispatch] In order to clarify public opinion and stop rumors, Hunan Chairman Cheng Qian issued a written statement of more than a thousand words on the 10th. The summary is as follows:

"Recently, the peace talks are underway. Except for a very small number of people, I believe that most people must hope for its smooth success. At present, the total number of troops and local teams on both sides is more than 20 million. Driving them into meaningless struggles will not only fail to produce anything, but both sides will also consume manpower and resources. If the fighting continues, the human race will also be destroyed. Thinking of this, anyone with a little conscience will be heartbroken. Therefore, everyone hopes for peace very much. As for my being listed as one of the war criminals, I will not defend myself and am willing to accept the public trial of the people. If I am truly found to have committed war crimes, I will not hesitate to be torn to pieces. Hunan is the Hunan of 30 million people. I do not recognize that a small number of people can consider themselves masters and control the fate of the majority of the people, and I oppose those who are partial and selfish and disregard the lives of the public and sell out Hunan. With a sincere and upright determination, I seek to save Hunan from the scourge of war, the people from the fire of artillery, social order to be stabilized, and local vitality to be preserved. I hope that at this critical juncture, everyone will work together to satisfy this one requirement: Changsha is the nerve center of local administration. It is necessary to maintain stability, not to alarm each other, and especially not to believe rumors. All opportunistic and self-righteous remarks will not help the actual situation. Finally, Cheng warned "no more creating new ideas and disrupting the process, no more digging one's own grave and causing suffering to the people."

[Our Changsha Bureau, 10th Dispatch] The local Gongshang Bao published "Chairman Song (Cheng Qian) is willing to be Fu Zuoyi," and on April 7, students marched and shouted "Demand to be like Beiping," with all kinds of absurd arguments, causing unrest in people's hearts. In addition to issuing a written statement, Cheng Qian also ordered the Gongshang Bao to be permanently suspended for its absurd remarks.

### Amidst Reports of CCP Ceasing Offensive, Artillery Battles Still Fierce North of Yangtze; Some Stray Shells Heard in Capital, Injuring People in Longtan; CCP Attempt to Cross Yangtze Southward Foiled in Anqing

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th Dispatch] Several faint sounds of artillery fire were heard in the capital after dusk on the 10th, clearer in Xiaguan and the northern part of the city. This was the first time the capital had heard the sound of artillery fire since the war moved southward. However, the artillery fire was from the National Army, not the Communist Army. It is reported that around 7 li southwest of Jiangpu, a village was raided by a thousand Communist soldiers in the afternoon of the 10th, and a battle occurred with the defending troops. The National Army artillery north of the Yangtze River was ordered to fire in support around dusk, so the sound of artillery fire intermittently reached the south bank. The battle in that area continued until late at night, with no changes in the positions.

[Our Zhenjiang Bureau, 10th Dispatch] Military sources here claim that when the Communist army captured Dahekou, located on the opposite side of Longtan in the northwest direction, on the evening of the 8th, they fired artillery shells at the south bank. One shell landed in Longtan, which is about 8 li from Longtan Station, injuring nine people. Foreign wire reports that the shell landed at the station are inaccurate. Also, during this attack on Yiwei, 80% of the Communist artillerymen in Dahekou and Sanjiangying were Japanese.

[Our Zhenjiang Bureau, 10th Dispatch] Elite troops of the National Army continued to arrive at Shierxu on the 10th, stabilizing the situation. The Communist 16th Army's Zhang Juchu division, with more than 10,000 soldiers, is now attacking in an encircling posture, but the area remains safe. Also, a captured Communist soldier from the Yizheng battle said that the 25th Army of the Communist Army is still located in Longheji, west of Yangzhou and south of Yizheng. The 24th Army has recently arrived in the suburbs of Yangzhou, seemingly as a follow-up force for an active southward advance.

[Our Zhenjiang Bureau, 10th Dispatch] The Communist army attacking Liuxu continued to increase on the 10th and moved southward in an arc from the east, west, and north. On the morning of the 9th, the vanguard troops had reached the vicinity of Chenjiaqiao, 4 li from Liuxu. After reinforcements from the National Army arrived this morning, they continuously fired artillery at the area, and the Communist army retreated north to Chenjiaqiao. The defending troops moved into the bridge.

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th Dispatch] According to the Military News Agency: (1) The Communist army that captured Dahekou continued to attack Huashikou at 10 p.m. on the 9th, and the defending troops are resisting. (2) Gaoqiao Town, south of Sanjiangying, across the river from Dagang, was captured by the Communist army at 6 p.m. on the 9th, and the National Army retreated to Jingkou Ferry. (3) Nengwo is still firmly defended by the National Army. (4) Fierce fighting took place in Longshaogang, southeast of the port, starting at 8 p.m. on the 9th. (5) A small part of the Liangshan position on the opposite bank of Wuhu was captured by the Communist army on the morning of the 10th, and the National Army is counterattacking. (6) The Communist army in Huayang, upstream of Anqing, began shelling the south bank on the evening of the 8th, which did not stop all night. On the morning of the 9th, the Communist army crossed the river southward by boat, and more than ten boats were sunk by the National Army, and the remaining boats were scattered. The Communist army shelled the south bank all day on the 9th.

[Central News Agency, Zhenjiang, 10th Dispatch] The Communist army attacked the National Army's position at Longwokou north of the Yangtze River on the 9th, and the battle was fierce. By dawn on the 10th, the Communist army had charged several times, with corpses lying all over the field. They suffered more than 5,000 casualties but ultimately failed. The Communist army's offensive at Longshaogang once stalled on the 9th, but resumed its fierce attack on the position at night, and the offensive eased by the morning of the 10th.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] Military news: The battle in the areas of Liangshan Yuxikou and Erba on the opposite bank of Wuhu continued. The Communist army launched another fierce attack at 8 p.m. on the 9th, and a small part of the Xiliangshan position was captured by the morning of the 10th. The National Army is fighting bravely in a counterattack.

[United Press, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] Officials today announced that the National Army has abandoned Hekou and Yaojiaji under the pressure of the Communist army's Lin Biao's forces and is withdrawing to Changxuanling, 36 miles north of Hankou. Another unit of the Communist army occupied Xishui, 55 miles east of Hankou. The National Army also abandoned Huangmei, 30 miles north of Jiujiang, and retreated towards Jiujiang. The National Army bridgehead on the opposite bank of Wuhu is currently under heavy attack by the Communist army.

### Communist Army is Flowing Southward, Vowing to Liberate the Entire Country

[Report from our newspaper] The CCP has not yet stopped its propaganda offensive. In yesterday's news broadcast on CCP radio, it continued to attack the government and admitted that the Northeast and North China Communist armies are marching south along railways, highways, roads, and waterways to "liberate" the area south of the Yangtze River. On the North China Plain, large armies are continuously flowing south, and recruitment campaigns are being expanded everywhere. The radio station also claimed that three field armies of the Communist army are in line with the CCP's eight peace conditions, realizing true peace and liberating Jiangnan. The Central Plains People's Liberation Army and the East China People's Liberation Army have now been reorganized into the Second and Third Field Armies, and most of them have gathered on the north bank of the Yangtze River. The Fourth Field Army, reorganized from the Northeast Liberation Army, is flowing south in a steady stream. According to the broadcast, the National Army deployed in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River numbers about 300,000, and about 200,000 are distributed in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. The total number is less than all the National Army in the Huaihai Campaign, and their morale is said to be far inferior to that of the Communist Army. In order to liberate the entire China, all railways, highways, and country roads north of the Yangtze River are being repaired. From the Yalu River to the Yangtze River, food and laborers are flowing south with the Communist army. The river channels along the Yangtze River have also been dredged, and tens of thousands of ships are waiting, ready to cross the river. At the same time, the people south of the Yangtze River will also take action to welcome the Communist army. The first detachment of the CCP's southward work team, with 2,600 members in four brigades, held an opening ceremony in Zhongshan Park, Beiping on the 8th. Lin Biao and Luo Ronghuan attended and delivered speeches. Lin Biao said that the Communist army has won a decisive victory, and the future task is to realize true democratic peace in the whole of China in accordance with the CCP's eight conditions.

The Communist army is actively transporting grain and ammunition between Huangzhai and Xihuangshui north of the city. Four artillery pieces towed by Communist army cars were found near Xihuangshui. The Jin-Chahar-Hebei Communist Army is also forcibly conscripting laborers in various counties.

### Whether Long Yun Will Return to Yunnan is Undecided; His Son Says There are Three Prerequisites: Resolve Economic Issues, Establish Yunnan Army

[Our Kunming Bureau, 10th Dispatch] Yang Wenqing, a committee member of the Yunnan Provincial Committee, who was previously the representative of Chairman Lu to pay his respects to Acting President Li in Nanjing to discuss various issues related to the Yunnan territory and was ordered to visit former Chairman Long in Hong Kong, returned to Kunming at noon on the 10th after completing his mission. According to him, Long Yun is in good health in Hong Kong, and the various rumors are not credible. Long has no intention of returning to Yunnan for the time being. Yang told reporters that this trip was quite satisfactory, and he is scheduled to visit Chairman Lu on the 11th to report on the progress.

[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 10th Dispatch] Long Yun's eldest son, Long Shengwu, said that his father has not yet made a decision on Acting President Li's invitation to reassume the chairmanship of Yunnan. There are three prerequisites for his father to accept Acting President Li's invitation: (1) Yunnan should adopt a stable currency; (2) there should be a balanced economy so that Yunnan can meet its own needs without the need for Nanjing's assistance; and (3) a Yunnan army should be established. Long Shengwu confirmed that he had visited Nanjing on behalf of his father, who was unable to go in person due to poor health. He also said that Long Yun's return to Yunnan "may be extremely complicated," and his attitude will depend on the position of the National Government and the public opinion of the people of Yunnan. Well-informed sources said that Long Yun has always been known for his caution in politics, so he is hesitant about Acting President Li's invitation. He naturally hopes to return to his province, but he seems to avoid any action that could arouse the suspicion of the Communists. Communist newspapers here have not published any news hostile to Long Yun so far, perhaps because of his hostile attitude towards President Chiang. The same source believes that Long Yun recently declined a visit to North China but sent a letter to his old friend Li Jishen, chairman of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee now in Beiping, explaining that he could not make the trip due to "poor health." Well-informed sources here deny that Long Yun has a bad relationship with the current Chairman of Yunnan, Lu Han. On the contrary, Lu Han's provincial government retains many of Long Yun's former friends, and Lu often maintains contact with Long Yun. A British businessman here, who had lived in Kunming for several years, recently returned to Hong Kong and said that this statement seemed extremely unreliable, because Long Yun and Lu Han were not only relatives but also belonged to the same unit and were close friends. He believes that the government's actions are due to the frequent rebellions in Yunnan. In the past few weeks, the rebels have occupied more than 20 towns, and the Communist army near the province is rumored to have the strength of a "division." If Long Yun agrees to return to Yunnan, his personal appeal may help prevent the immediate collapse of the National Government's rear in southwest China; otherwise, it will close all supply lines via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway.

### Wuhan on the Edge of the Flames of War

[Our Hankou Bureau, 10th Dispatch] As war approaches Wuhan, the hard news today cannot highlight this heavy scene. Below, I would like to use a little bit of information to describe some of "Wuhan on the Edge of the Flames of War."

Perhaps it has been too dull for too long. People do not seem to regard this precarious reality as "the eve of the storm." Although some are numb and some are sensitive, generally speaking, people's hearts are still extraordinarily calm.

The frontal defense line of the Ping-Han Railway has been shortening repeatedly, and it seems that no one is very vigilant. When the soldiers and horses from the south to the north crossed the streets, stepped into the suburbs, and drilled into the trenches and embankments, everyone stared blankly, welcoming and sending them off, and somewhat felt the evil omen of "chariots rumbling and horses neighing."

"Let's go, Wuhan may be devastated!" Some wealthy and selfish people and some who yearn for safety all had this feeling in their hearts. As a result, the wharves of the Yuehan Railway were crowded with people, luggage piled up like mountains, and the number of passengers registering for the Shanghai-Hankou flight exceeded 1,500. The most eye-catching thing was the distant flight of several yarn factory owners.

Amidst this busy chaos, at 2 p.m. yesterday, workers at the Xujiapeng Wharf dropped a bomb they were carrying, killing a total of seven porters and pedestrians and injuring more than ten. Fortunately, this was not a gathering place for tourists and did not cause a greater tragedy.

"What are we running away from! Where are we going?" Although a few people are panicking, most people are still very calm. Especially the newly opened Wuhan Municipal Assembly, which is conducting a lengthy review of the overall situation. Mr. Geng Bozhao said, "We want to shout for peace. Whoever is not for peace, we will overthrow them!" From beginning to end, they seem to believe that the war will not invade Wuhan and that peace can certainly be shared.

Looking at the response of government agencies, it is also somewhat subtle. Although the provincial and municipal governments have made emergency preparations, the attitudes of some public institutions are somewhat uneven. The Third District Telecommunications Administration has begun to move to Changsha and Nanchang in groups, while the employees of the Wuhan Telecommunications Bureau are purchasing rice, determined to "stick to their posts to the end"!

As for the market, whether it is the yarn market, the cloth market, or even the rice market, there is a general sluggishness. In addition to small-scale transactions, there is no large-scale hoarding. Only the price of silver dollars has risen sharply, causing serious panic among public school teachers and workers.

Most heartbreakingly, mysterious leaflets and warnings have appeared on the market, and the security authorities have dispatched a large number of police officers to detect and arrest spies. In addition, the transit garrison troops are moving frequently, the Hankou military conscription campaign is being actively launched, and the telecommunications personnel who have been withdrawn from Huangpi are crowded at the gate of the Wuhan Telecommunications Bureau, with wives weeping and children crying, playing a particularly tense and tragic scene.

Doesn't all of this symbolize that the scourge of war is unavoidable? But every song stage and theater is full, and the underground dance halls are "booming" non-stop. Who can believe that this place is already facing the edge of the flames of war?

### One of the Mysterious Guests from Peiping: Liu Ziheng Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday; Said to Be a Personal Trip, Planning to Stay One Day

[Report from Our Newspaper] Liu Ziheng, one of the mysterious guests from Peiping to the capital, arrived in Shanghai from Peiping yesterday morning. Mr. Liu appears to be in his forties, wearing an old black cotton robe and a gray felt hat, looking very much like a rural teacher from the mainland, and not at all like a political envoy traveling north and south. Mr. Liu stated that he would only stay in Shanghai for one day, and did not disclose his residence or friends he planned to visit, but repeatedly and solemnly declared, "This trip to Shanghai is entirely a personal action and does not represent any opinion from any party." Mr. Liu also claimed to be from Teng County, Shandong, and arrived in Peiping from a certain place after the liberation of North China.

Editorial

### Can Diplomatic Offensives Stop the Cold War?

After the signing of the Atlantic Treaty in Washington, D.C., the international situation took a sharp turn for the worse. On the one hand, the "Cold War" between the East and West became increasingly intense. The Soviet Union and the countries within its "Iron Curtain" all condemned the Atlantic Treaty as creating a new international war and openly denounced the United States as a "war monger." This anti-American propaganda war can be said to have reached its peak. On the American side, they were not to be outdone. President Truman warned the world that "for the sake of human welfare and world peace, the United States will not hesitate to use the atomic bomb again." On the other hand, the rearmament of Western European countries has become increasingly concrete. The eight Western European countries have made an urgent appeal to the United States, requesting military and economic assistance. The U.S. authorities have responded positively, saying that a plan for military assistance to Europe is being drafted, with a total requirement of more than 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. All of this is enough to show the seriousness of the international situation. The world today is indeed moving closer to the road to war, and no matter from which angle we observe this trend, it is a great misfortune for mankind.

Observing the recent trends in American foreign policy, it is not difficult to see that the focus of American diplomatic activity is still in Western Europe, and it has not shifted due to Churchill's warning (that the collapse of China is a great tragedy after the victory of World War II). Moreover, the U.S. State Department has already drafted a series of plans. The signing of the Atlantic Treaty is the first step in the American diplomatic offensive, followed by many planned steps. According to what we have already seen, there are the following two items: First, the intensified implementation of the pro-German policy. The so-called West German Agreement has also been signed in Washington, D.C., with four key points: (1) Unifying the administration of the British and American occupation zones with the French occupation zone, and gradually abolishing the boundaries of the three occupation zones; (2) Establishing a West German government within the next sixty days; (3) Standardizing the military missions of the British, American, and French occupation forces; (4) Recognizing West Germany as one of the signatories of the Atlantic Treaty. Second, assisting Western European countries in rearming. The defense ministers of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg met in The Hague and passed a military plan to defend Western Europe, and decided on how to implement this military plan. However, the greatest difficulty for Western European countries to rearm is that the wounds of the war have not yet healed, and the economic difficulties are the most troublesome. If they cannot obtain assistance from the United States, whether this military plan can be realized is also a very large question. Therefore, Western European countries have made an urgent appeal to the United States, which has expressed its willingness to provide generous assistance, with a total cost of more than 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. In addition, the second-year aid to Europe bill, which allocates 5.8 billion U.S. dollars to assist Western European countries in reviving their economies, will also complete the legislative process and is expected to be established within days.

From the perspective of the American plan for Western European countries, it is meticulous and far-sighted. Relying on its "unparalleled" capital—the U.S. dollar—it can be expected to stand in an invincible position, making the East feel a sense of "intrinsic inferiority." However, whether the United States can defeat its opponent in the "Cold War" between the East and West by adopting this set of diplomatic offensives and force it to demand the cessation of the "Cold War" is probably still an unanswerable question. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson told reporters from the Associated Press on the 8th: "The recent courageous actions of the Western Allies have strengthened the opportunity for a peaceful resolution of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. The United States will wholeheartedly support the resolution of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, and refuse to conduct negotiations with the Soviet Union again until the Soviet Union lifts the blockade of Berlin." From this, it can be seen that Secretary of State Acheson believes that as long as the United States can deal with the Soviet Union with strong means, it can force the Soviet Union to submit. Therefore, he is very optimistic about the future of the U.S.-Soviet Cold War and insists on the consistent position of the Western Allies, which is to take the prior lifting of the Berlin blockade by the Soviet Union as a prerequisite for reopening negotiations. As far as Acheson himself is concerned, he may have his own reasons for holding this confidence; but as we see it, from the Atlantic Treaty to the West German Agreement, from the Marshall Plan to the aid to Europe and rearmament, although it can explain the active American policy toward Europe, it is determined to use strength to fill the weak vacuum in Europe; but the consequences may still not achieve the goal of forcing the Soviet Union to submit and demand the cessation of the Cold War. It may even lead to the opposite result, making the development of the Cold War more likely to increase rather than decrease. Not only will the permanent division of Germany not have the hope of reunification, but the rearmament of Western European countries will also make the people of all countries deeply feel the pain of "cannons before butter."

In the above analysis, we do not have the intention of pouring cold water on the elated diplomats of the Western Allies, and we do not have any subconscious opposition to the Western Allies. Rather, we want the political diplomats of the Western Allies to observe the general trend of the world and must weigh the gains and losses from the entire world. Today, the scope of the Cold War is not limited to Europe. If the Western Allies only know how to work hard in Europe to fill the "vacuum zone" with strength, and ignore the "vacuum zone" elsewhere, even if they are always successful in Europe, they still cannot obtain decisive results. Churchill said: "To weigh the gains and losses of the Cold War, both Europe and Asia should be considered together." This famous saying is most worthy of deep reflection by the political diplomats of the Western Allies today.

### Republican Senator Smith Suggests Cutting $500 Million in Aid to Europe to Transfer to Aid to China; If China Collapses, All of Asia Will Turn Red

[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] After the second year of the Aid to Europe Recovery Act was submitted to the House for discussion today, it has sparked a new movement to increase aid to China, led by Republican Senator Smith, who proposed cutting $500 million from the second phase of the Aid to Europe Act to restore aid to China. Smith said that the Soviet Union is conducting a frantic race to take over Asia without firing a shot. Then the Philippines will be like a sitting duck, and Japan and the Pacific Islands, and even our Alaska, will be in danger. I hope you will not think that this situation can be laughed off. The United States is willing to spend billions of dollars to deal with the threat of communism in Europe, but in China, it insists that the Kuomintang government should reorganize into a coalition government, accommodating the Communist Party in a favorable position to support communism. I now denounce the current policy of the State Department, which is to trade with the Communist Party when the opportunity arises, and is currently taking action to destroy the officials of the Republic of China. I really doubt whether we really want to stop communism. Once China collapses, all of Asia will turn red, and when the door is opened, the Soviet Union can control more than half of the world's population. The Soviet Union should be blocked in Europe, but we cannot risk the communization of Asia and the Pacific Islands. Smith suggested that the ECA's aid to Europe program could be cut by at least $500 million without any harm. Speaker Rayburn predicted that Smith's proposal or any similar proposal would not be submitted for discussion.

### The World Situation is Fraught with Danger; U.S. Defense Spending is Unprecedentedly Large; The Total Amount Exceeds 15.9 Billion, Approved by the House Appropriations Committee; The Air Force Decides to Expand to Seventy Squadrons

[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] In an atmosphere of overt anti-Soviet sentiment, the House Appropriations Committee passed a bill on the 9th to allocate 15.9091168 billion yuan to the Army, Navy, and Air Force in the fiscal year beginning July 1, setting a new post-war record, an increase of more than 5 billion over the amount previously requested by President Truman. The committee also overturned Truman's opinion and voted to allow the Air Force to form 70 squadrons.

[Reuters, Washington, 9th] Congressman Mahon, chairman of the subcommittee drafting the bill, said in a report to the Appropriations Committee that due to the dangerous world situation, we have no choice but to make sacrifices. The budget stipulates that the U.S. military has a total of 4,743,100 officers and soldiers, including 1,644,200 regular troops, 399,500 National Guard troops, and 2,709,300 organized reserve troops. Among the regular troops, the Army has 677,000 troops, the Navy has 527,300 troops (including 85,700 Marines), and the Air Force has 440,000 troops. The budget also includes 3.7 million yuan for the National Security Resources Committee and 189 million yuan for veterans' pensions, as well as 530 million yuan for research and development. The largest increase in the budget is for the Air Force, with 209 million yuan in cash and 642 million yuan in contract amounts for purchasing new aircraft and training new aircraft crew members. The Navy's budget stipulates a total of 731 ships, including the battleship "Missouri," eight heavy aircraft carriers, eleven escort light aircraft carriers, eighteen cruisers, one hundred and seventy destroyers and escort destroyers, eighty submarines, ninety-nine torpedo boats and patrol boats, eighty-four amphibious boats, and two hundred and sixty auxiliary ships. In addition, 43 million yuan of the 189 million yuan total cost of the super aircraft carrier "United States" is also included in the next year's budget. A Navy spokesman told the Appropriations Committee that he believes the U.S. Navy can act quickly anywhere in the world, but Navy Secretary Sullivan is still dissatisfied that the Navy Air Corps can only purchase 843 new aircraft in the next year. He specifically pointed out that a certain foreign country currently has more than 250 submarines.

War is Not Likely to Break Out at Present

During the debate on the bill, Army Chief of Staff Bradley told the committee that he does not expect a war to occur in the year ending June 30, 1950. He was more worried last year than he is today, but he did not elaborate. Army Vice Chief of Staff Wedemeyer said that he does not think a war will break out immediately, but he also admitted that accidental incidents may occur, the development of which may lead to participation in the war. Air Force Secretary Symington said that possible aggressors will not have atomic bombs until 1952, so war is not likely to break out at present. Air Force Vice Chief of Staff Clay said that the United States is fully aware of the knowledge the Soviet Union has acquired from German atomic scientists.

### Full Text of West Germany's New Occupation Statute Submitted to German Constitutional Assembly; Three Powers Retain Control Over Nine Important Departments, Granting German Government Greater Authority Within a Year and a Half

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 10th (Broadcast), Berlin: Today, the Allied military authorities of West Germany submitted the new occupation statute, which was announced last Friday, to the Bonn Assembly. The statute was signed by the three governors: Clay of the United States, Robertson of the United Kingdom, and Koenig of France. The three powers also declared the following points: (1) The West German government has full legislative, administrative, and judicial powers. (2) The Western powers retain administrative control over nine government departments: foreign affairs, disarmament, management of the Ruhr area, handling of refugees, Allied security, foreign trade, German prisoners of war, UN economic aid, and education.

(3) The three powers have veto power over any German legislation that violates the principles of occupation. (4) The occupation authorities deeply hope that no further intervention will be necessary outside of the aforementioned nine departments. (5) When receiving instructions from their respective countries, the occupying powers may take certain measures, when necessary, to maintain the democratic system in Germany. (6) Before exercising the powers mentioned in the previous article, the occupying powers will notify the West German government and explain the reasons for taking such measures. (7) The West German government has no power to abolish the occupation statute. (8) After one year, within eighteen months, the occupying powers will review the occupation statute again and decide whether to grant the German government greater authority.

Granting Germany Autonomous Opportunity Has Semi-Treaty Nature

[United Press Bonn 10th] The occupation statute established by the United States, Britain, and France has a semi-treaty nature. The full text is about 700 words. It will take effect as soon as Germany establishes a Federal Republic, which is expected around July 1st. The contents of the statute grant the 45 million people of West Germany an opportunity for autonomy.

West Germany Re-Drafts Constitution Based on Three-Power Agreement

[Reuters Bonn 9th] The Bonn Assembly, in view of the fact that the constitution previously drafted had not been approved by the Allied powers and the new situation arising from the Washington Agreement, has drafted a provisional constitution for West Germany to serve as the minimum legal basis for the German government and parliament to begin work. The leader of the German Social Democratic Party in the constitutional assembly believes that since the three-power agreement has given Germany the opportunity to obtain an independent government and participate in the European group, Germany should not easily give up. If the Allied powers insist that financial powers should be individually controlled by the federal states and not centralized in the federal authorities, Germany can only try it, even if it considers it impractical. However, the Social Democratic Party also stated that their concession was not voluntary but was due to the intervention of the Allied powers, which made the new West German constitution no longer a democratic constitution but merely a kind of administrative regulation.

### Moscow Commentary

### British Prime Minister Attlee Points Out That Two Soviets Are Responsible for Dividing the World; Soviet Side Accuses Bevin of Pursuing Unfriendly Policy Toward the Soviet Union

[Reuters London 10th] Prime Minister Attlee today delivered a blunt speech on Soviet communism at a Labor Party rally in Glasgow, accusing the Soviet Union of being responsible for dividing the world. He said that the Atlantic Pact is not aggressive but purely defensive. To attack the pact is motivated by evil intentions. The Soviet Union is like Germany before the war, thinking that the defensive combination of other countries is an encirclement of the Soviet Union.

Attlee said that the Atlantic Pact is not the first action of the Western countries. First, there was the Marshall Aid Agreement, which was warmly welcomed by the European countries that had suffered from the war. The Eastern European countries originally intended to participate in the agreement, but after a little hesitation, the Soviet Union immediately stopped them. We do not give up hope of uniting the world, but it must be done by the Communist Party abandoning its attempt to force the world to accept its doctrine and force everyone to wear the straitjacket of Lenin-Marxism before the world can move towards unity. We believe that the human spirit should be free, and this is the creed of British socialism.

[Reuters London 10th] Moscow Radio commentator Livonidov today asked British Foreign Secretary Bevin to cite a fact to prove that the Soviet Union had ever threatened Britain, France, the United States, or any participating country of the Atlantic Pact. Livonidov said that no one in our country believes that the general people of Britain are willing to end British friendship with the Soviet Union. Livonidov also pointed out that one of the main promises of the Labor Party during the election was to promise to strengthen and develop British-Soviet friendship. Bevin himself once said that the Labor Party would aim at close cooperation with the Soviet Union. Everyone knows that this promise has never been fulfilled.

### Testing West European Defense Capabilities; Joint Naval and Air Force Exercises to Be Held in the English Channel This Summer

Liu Hongsheng, Xu Jiyi, Pan Shihao, Wang Xiaolai, Xie Tiansha, Tian Hexiang, Luo Qinghua, and Ye Fukan expressed their opinions, analyzing the formation and gains and losses of the current economic situation in detail. Generally, they all believed that the exchange of materials between the north and south was indeed necessary, but the implementation method needed to be studied. Finally, Chairman Chen Liang summarized the results of the discussion, saying that the most pressing issues at the moment are food, fuel, and prices. The municipal government and relevant agencies discuss the food issue every day and believe that it will proceed as planned. The fuel issue has also been effectively resolved by the competent authorities in accordance with the established policy. The price issue will still be handled by the Economic Conference composed of sixteen agencies. In addition to the economic conference, there are also issues such as the cash shortage, the purchase of raw materials for factories, the production and sales of industrial products, and many specific issues related to the exchange of materials between the north and south. The final decision was

### National Bank to Sell Silver Dollars; to be Implemented Within the Week

Last week, prices rose crazily, which greatly affected people's lives. Minister of Finance Liu Gongyun and officials from the National Bank held meetings in Shanghai to discuss countermeasures. It has been decided to expand the sale of gold and silver this week to tighten credit and suppress prices. According to sources, in addition to gold, the long-prepared sale of silver dollars will officially begin this week. Since the Central Mint resumed minting last month, it has minted more than 6.7 million new "boat dollars," which have been continuously transported to the National Bank's treasury. Except for two times when the Business Bureau distributed them to customers, most of them have not been touched. This week, the market price can be slightly stabilized.

Also, rumors that the Central Mint will stop minting boat dollars and switch to minting Yuan Datou dollars have been denied by the person in charge of the factory, who stated that it is absolutely not true.

### One Step Too Late; Large Batch of New Five Yuan Bills; Arrives as Waste Paper

At a stage where price increases are nearing madness, a steamed bun costs 500 yuan. Recently, the National Bank shipped back a large batch of five yuan gold yuan bills printed in the United States. The gold yuan bills were originally ordered in the United States during the price limit period in August last year. They were only shipped to port today and cannot be circulated on the market. The National Bank failed to complete the printing and issuance of the gold yuan bills in time, and by today, they have almost become waste, resulting in huge losses. The responsibility is being investigated.

### Police Station Chief Flees in Fear of Punishment for Corruption; Supervisory District Notifies All Stations to Assist in Apprehending Wu Shangzhi

Wu Shangzhi, the chief of the Suzhou River branch of the Municipal Water Police Bureau, was involved in corruption and dereliction of duty. He arbitrarily detained people without following legal procedures. He did not try to solve theft cases in the area, nor did he report them to his superiors. All these facts have been personally and thoroughly investigated and confirmed by Xu Guang, the chief of the First Supervisory District in charge. The relevant police officers have been detained. Wu Shangzhi, the police station chief, fled in fear of punishment on the afternoon of the 9th. The Supervisory District is currently compiling investigation materials and reporting them to Director Mao for review, and at the same time notifying all branches and stations to assist in the arrest.

### New Method of Wage Payment by British Electric Tramway Company; Labor Union Hopes for Early Improvement

The British Electric Tramway Company's delay in paying wages for too long has caused more serious disputes between labor and management. It is rumored that the disputes have been resolved, but this is not the case. On the contrary, they are brewing. For this reason, the reporter specifically visited the company's industrial union to find out the truth. According to Qiu Changjiang, the chairman of the union, since the drastic fluctuations in prices in the past ten days, five of the city's six major public utilities (French Electric, Power, Telephone, Gas, Water, and British Electric) have improved their wage payment methods to avoid huge losses to employees. However, the British Electric Tramway Company failed to accept the workers' requests and has not improved. The wages for the first half of this month were delayed for seven days, and as a result, 100,000 yuan in wages were affected by rising prices, leaving only 46,000 yuan. Therefore, the workers are very dissatisfied and hope that the company can understand the difficulties of the labor side and pay wages in the same way as the other five unions. Otherwise, they will resolutely strive for their rights through legal channels until they achieve their goals. Finally, Chairman Qiu earnestly stated that the entire workforce is currently in a state of indignation, and the labor union is trying to persuade them. However, it is better to resolve the matter as soon as possible. If it is delayed, it will inevitably lead to problems!

### Police Officer Dies Tragically Under Wheels; Soldier Carelessly Drives Car; Three Accidents in a Row

[Report from this newspaper] At around 9:50 AM on the 9th, a medium-sized Jeep military vehicle (military number 95061) belonging to a certain infantry unit stationed in Jiading, driven by soldier Yang Qi (21 years old, from Sichuan), drove from its station to Shanghai on official business. When it arrived at Jiangxun, it hit and injured a wounded soldier. The driver still drove at full speed after the accident. Unexpectedly, it passed lightly through Yixian Road and turned into the intersection of West Tiyu Road, where it knocked down the 950 police officer Jie Lingbin (42 years old, from Shandong) from the Tiyu Road police station of the Xinshi Street police branch. Jie sustained injuries to his waist and abdomen, and his brain was concussed, barely breathing. Unfortunately, misfortunes never come singly. In a panic, the driver hurriedly moved the steering wheel, trying to escape. A new military truck led by the Jiangyin Fortress Command came head-on and was also hit by the car, damaging the front and internal mechanisms. The police officers from the police station arrived and detained the offending soldier, transferring him to the branch for investigation. They also rushed the injured police officer to the police hospital for treatment, but he died en route due to his severe injuries.

### Another Person After Shui Yao Chen; Suspected Victim of Dismemberment Case; Guo Maofu's Leave of Absence Caused Misunderstanding

[Report from our correspondent in Suzhou on the 10th] After the mystery of Shui Yao Chen's disappearance in the dismemberment case on Huji Road in Shanghai was revealed, the police suspected that another person named Guo was also a victim. Guo Guoliang, an employee of the Hangzhou Railways Bureau, had a son named Maofu, who worked as a clerk in the Suzhou Military Prison. He also disappeared before the dismemberment case occurred. However, his father came to Suzhou a few days ago and found his son, who returned to Hangzhou with him. The fact is that Guo took a leave of absence at the time, and the letter was delayed in arriving, causing a misunderstanding. This second mystery of disappearance has also been cleared up.

### Economic Council to Hold First Meeting Tomorrow; Soaring Prices; Authorities Decide to Increase Control

For a week, prices have been like a runaway horse, changing several times a day, which is not only related to the lives of citizens but also affects social order. In view of the above situation, the municipal government has decided to strengthen economic controls to stabilize prices and maintain people's livelihoods. With the consent of the relevant agencies, an Economic Council has been established to control prices. The outline for the organization and implementation of the Economic Council was drafted by the Social Affairs Bureau and will be submitted for discussion at the first meeting tomorrow, after which it can be implemented. Regarding the causes of the continuous price increases, Cao, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated that according to reports from the relevant departments, this crazy price surge was led by gold yuan and silver dollars and was purely manipulated by speculators. However, gold yuan and silver dollars are not within the scope of control of the Social Affairs Bureau, so he specially reported to Secretary-General Chen of the Municipal Government and obtained the consent of various agencies to establish the Economic Council. Rates will be set for rice, coal, and other important daily necessities to regulate them. The detailed methods will be drafted today and submitted for discussion at tomorrow's meeting.

According to relevant authorities, the continuous price increases are led by rampant off-exchange gold and foreign exchange transactions, and are purely manipulated by a few speculators. Close attention will be paid to the situation. At the same time, off-exchange trading telephone lines will be dismantled to reduce the possibility of price manipulation of coal, rice, oil, yarn, and cloth. It is reported that a few large players have been driving up prices in the off-exchange gold, US dollar, and securities speculation market, which affects the lives of citizens. The authorities have been paying close attention to the situation and will deal with it according to the law.

### Bloodshed Occurs in the China Industrial Bank Building Yesterday Morning; Small Worker Murders Wife, Stabbing Her More Than 30 Times; Young Woman Dies Tragically Because She Refused to Work as a Maid

[Report from this newspaper] Gu Xingyao, 22 years old, from Haimen, is the younger cousin of Gu Xingtian, 40 years old, a store clerk at the Dongtaifeng Textile Machinery Trading Company's office on the fourth floor, number 40, of the China Industrial Bank Building at the intersection of Beijing Road and Huqiu Road. He was previously a small worker in the company. He was laid off due to corporate downsizing last winter and returned to his hometown. Last winter, he married Zhang Shuizhen, 20 years old, a fellow villager who worked as a female worker at the Datong Yarn Factory in Haimen. Not long after the marriage, due to unrest in the area, they came to Shanghai together on February 28th of the lunar calendar. They have been in Shanghai for more than two weeks and have been staying with relatives and friends every night because they have no money. The day before yesterday, Zhang was introduced by her cousin Xingtian to work as a maid at the home of an employee of Dongtaifeng. It was stated that she would go this morning. Since the original residence was inconvenient, the couple stayed at Xingtian's place the night before last (that is, in the office of Dongtaifeng Company). At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Xingtian went out on business, leaving only the two of them in the room. During a casual conversation, Zhang told Xingyao that life in Shanghai was becoming more expensive and that it would be better to return to their hometown. She expressed her unwillingness to work as a maid. Gu saw that his wife insisted on returning to their hometown, and his attempts to dissuade her were unsuccessful, leading to a quarrel. Xingyao suddenly became angry and murderous. He grabbed a blanket and threw Zhang to the ground, trying to strangle her. She resisted with all her might, but he did not succeed for a while. Xingyao suddenly saw a pair of small scissors on the table. He grabbed them and stabbed Zhang's face wildly, first blinding her by stabbing her eyes, and one eyeball flowed out. Then, he stabbed her face more than ten times. Zhang was injured and cried for help, grabbing her husband and refusing to let go. Xingyao then stabbed her throat, chest, abdomen, and other parts more than ten times, and Zhang died of her serious injuries. Seeing that he had caused a disaster, Xingyao fled in a panic to the gate downstairs. Yang Feizhang, the section member of the Huangpu Police Bureau, who was patrolling with police officers, saw that he was covered in blood and knew that something had happened, so he stopped him for questioning. The murderer's face was pale, and he was incoherent. At that time, his cousin also returned and learned that his cousin's wife had been stabbed to death. The police officers immediately went upstairs to inspect and found the deceased lying stiffly in a pool of blood, with a slight warmth in her chest. She was wearing a blue velvet cheongsam, a Shilin cloth jacket, gray striped trousers, and yellow leather shoes. Her feet were tied with ropes, and she had been stabbed more than thirty times. The police officers immediately telegraphed Chief Feng and Section Chief Liu to the scene for investigation and notified the photography section of the headquarters to send personnel to take photos for record. The body was then transported to the autopsy office. The murderer was taken to the bureau for interrogation. According to his confession, the deceased had thrown the scissors at him first during the conflict, so he killed her in anger. He also claimed that she had had an abortion once in her maiden's home, and this time she insisted on returning to her hometown because she was probably going to live with her lover again, so he killed her in anger.

### Five Thousand Japanese Yarn Spindles to Be Shipped to Shanghai

It is said that this is based on the principle of barter between private manufacturers in China and Japan, and our manufacturers will use tung oil and bean cake as exchange goods.

### Confiscated Checks for Relief Funds; Mo Dehui Writes to the District Court Requesting a Ruling to Void Rights

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Northeast Assets Inventory and Disposal Committee, formerly located within the customs, disbursed 60 million yuan in relief funds to refugees from the Northeast at the Huangpu Police Station in this city on February 7th. The funds were disbursed using special checks numbered 1 to 4,000 issued by the Central Bank, with face values of 10,000 and 20,000 yuan each. Unexpectedly, some of these checks were stolen. The committee has already issued a public statement and sent a special letter to the Central Bank for investigation. As of the 16th of last month, 303 checks worth 10,000 yuan and 76 checks worth 20,000 yuan had not been cashed. The committee is convinced that they were lost due to robbery and theft. Recently, Mr. Mo Dehui, in his own name, wrote to the District Court, requesting it to follow legal procedures, issue a public notice, and rule to void the rights associated with the stolen checks in order to protect the committee's interests.

### Overseas Chinese Women Unaccustomed to Living in the Motherland; Court Rules to Grant Husband a Divorce

[Our Newspaper's Report] Liang Beihe and his wife, Chen Yueqi, were both overseas Chinese from Canada. They married on July 29, 1933, in Vancouver, Canada, through an introduction. In September of the same year, Liang returned to China and practiced medicine in this city. At the end of the same year, he brought Chen back to China to live with him. However, Chen, accustomed to life in the West, felt very uncomfortable with life in her motherland. She repeatedly asked her husband to live abroad with her, but Liang refused. Their relationship deteriorated, and Chen repeatedly requested a divorce so that she could live abroad alone. Liang tried to dissuade her in every possible way, and she reluctantly lived in Shanghai for several years. In the autumn of 1940, on the eve of the outbreak of the Pacific War, Chen again asked her husband to live abroad with her. Liang resolutely refused, and Chen immediately bought a ship ticket and returned alone. However, Chen then purchased a ticket on the Japanese Empress ship and left without informing him. By the time Liang found out, it was too late to stop her. Afterwards, Chen's whereabouts were unknown, and her life or death was uncertain. Liang asked friends to search for her in Canada in every possible way, but without success. Last month, Liang filed a petition with the District Court, requesting a divorce from Chen. The court has now ruled to grant the divorce.

### Fishing Boat Robbed in Huangpu River; One Suspect Arrested

Two Notorious Water Rats at Large

[Our Newspaper's Report] Recently, early in the morning, fishmonger Zhang Jingen loaded over a hundred dan of yellow croaker onto six small boats and sailed from Qingning Temple in Pudong to Puxi. Unexpectedly, when they reached the center of the river, several pirate ships suddenly approached and blocked their path. Dozens of bandits jumped down, armed with pistols and wooden clubs. They ordered the crew to be silent and robbed them of over a hundred dan of yellow croaker, over twenty silver yuan, and all the shoes on the boats. Afterwards, the victim reported the incident to the Water Police Bureau, which ordered Inspector Chen Zhi of the Yangjing Police Station to be responsible for the investigation and arrest. As a result, three small boats were found at the Xidu Wharf, along with three axes and the stolen shoes. It was learned that the boats belonged to the notorious water rats Shen Xiaosanzi and Gu Xiaogou, but both had already fled. Subsequently, Inspector Chen arrested Xu Zhenquan, a suspect with significant involvement, and transferred him to the Water Police Bureau for interrogation.

### Workers' Home; Cornerstone Laid Yesterday; New Building of the General Labor Union on Changde Road to be Completed in a Few Months

The Shanghai General Labor Union held a cornerstone laying ceremony for its new building on Changde Road at 10:00 AM yesterday. All executive directors and supervisors of the union, as well as chairmen of various industry unions, attended. Guests included Lu Jingshi, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Agriculture and Labor, Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, Cao Peizi, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau (Lu Yun Dai), and others, totaling over 200 people. Zhou Xuexiang presided over the ceremony and reported that the union was originally located at 267 Penglai Road in the Nanshi district, but the building was simple and inconvenient. Furthermore, as this city is an international metropolis and the union is a representative of all workers in the city, the previous chairman, Shui Xiangyun, the current chairman, Zhou Xuexiang, and all executive directors and supervisors planned to build a new building. They also received support from Deputy Minister Lu of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Labor and called on all workers in the city to respond unanimously. As a result, the fundraising work was carried out actively. At the Third Members' Representative Assembly in November of the 36th year, union members from all industries enthusiastically donated one day's wages, and the funds began to take shape. After collecting this money, all of it was used to purchase materials. Furthermore, the Shanghai Municipal Social Welfare Commission donated the remaining materials from the Labor Hospital, and Mayor Wu allocated 20 million gold yuan, which provided considerable assistance. In addition, floating capital was used for lending and earning interest, so that the payment of construction wages could maintain the original currency value. Finally, it was stated that the smooth construction of the union's current building relied on the guidance, assistance, and donations of leaders from all sectors of the city, leaders of various labor unions, workers from various industries, and the enthusiastic support of all executive directors and supervisors of the fifth and sixth sessions, which ultimately led to its construction. The cornerstone has now been laid, and in a few days, we will see its completion. After Executive Supervisor Ye Xiangju reported on the fundraising process, Deputy Minister Lu Jingshi, Director Zhao Zukang, Director Cao Peizi (Lu Yun Dai), and others delivered speeches in succession. Finally, Executive Supervisor Shui Xiangyun gave a reply, stating briefly: The General Labor Union has been launching the construction of a new union building for more than a year. In the past, we only heard the sound of the stairs, but no one came downstairs. Now that the materials are complete and the cornerstone has been laid, the doubts of the general public can be dispelled from now on. This construction is not only a home for all workers in Shanghai, but will also promote the construction of buildings for labor unions throughout the country. With a magnificent building, the social status of a labor union can be improved invisibly, and it can also highlight the progress of China's labor movement in the international community, and further demonstrate the power of worker solidarity. In this regard, the spirit of the workers can be seen. According to the current estimates, the materials for the completion of the auditorium are still insufficient (approximately 4,000 shi of rice are needed). It is hoped that the workers of the city will continue to work hard to complete the construction of the auditorium. One monk is four, and 40,000 workers have great national strength. Unlike monks, who are empty of the four elements, as long as everyone takes a deep breath and exerts their strength, the goal will be achieved, and the auditorium will be completed. Following this, the cornerstone laying ceremony was held. After taking photos, the ceremony ended, and the meeting adjourned.

### The Reason for the Disconnect Between the Cost of Living Index and Commodity Prices; Many Unpopular Goods Included in the Categories; Price Surveys Conducted Four Times a Month Must Be Averaged

[Our Newspaper's Special] If I were to say, "The cost of living index is very scientific and very accurate," countless salaried people who live according to the "cost of living index" would certainly stare at me with disbelief! The ironclad fact before our eyes is that the city's 1.3 million salaried people have personally experienced that the "cost of living index" has never kept up with the actual prices. Is it reasonable to calculate salaries using such an index? The answer is self-evident, but the blame does not lie with the index itself.

Some people may ask: Since the cost of living index is based on commodity prices, why is it so far out of sync with the price multiples? This question must be answered in two ways. First, the cost of living index is fundamentally not a price multiple. It includes many "unpopular goods." The rate of price increase for "unpopular goods" is extremely slow. After the index is averaged, it is naturally not as high as the price multiples of general goods. Second, although the cost of living index includes many "unpopular goods" with relatively slow rates of price increase, it should not be so far out of sync with the price multiples. Therefore, the key to the problem must lie elsewhere. What does this mean? We are influenced by habit, and every time we mention the four words "cost of living index," we naturally think of what the municipal government publishes on the 15th of the month and at the end of the month. In fact, what the municipal government publishes in the middle and at the end of each month is not the real cost of living index, but the average of the four cost of living indexes in half a month. This is because each time a price survey is conducted, a cost of living index is generated. This index is indeed the comparison number between the price survey on that day and the cost of living on its "base period." However, when the four indexes in half a month are added together and divided by four, the resulting "average index" is bound to be out of sync with commodity prices. Therefore, although there are more than one reason for the disconnect between the cost of living index and commodity prices, the biggest key lies in the "average index."

The Larger the Price Increase, the Greater the Difference

During the era of fiat currency, we often heard the phrase "price increase in [month]." At that time, commodity prices increased intermittently and cyclically. For example, after the price increase in May, commodity prices in June and July would be relatively stable, so the difference in the "average index" would not be too large. Now it's different. Look at how commodity prices are increasing every day. According to the trajectory of price increases in recent months, almost every commodity is increasing by about 10% every day. Regardless of whether this is the government's fiscal policy or the inevitable result of malignant inflation, in short, this orderly daily increase is making the difference between the cost of living index and the average index larger and larger. To give a simple example: on the 4th of this month, each dan of white polished rice cost 180,000 yuan, which is 9,000 times higher than on "August 19" of last year. On the 8th of this month, each shi of white polished rice cost 220,000 yuan, which is 11,000 times higher than on "August 19." The average is 10,000 times. Assuming that the base salary is 20 yuan (which could buy one shi of rice on August 19 of last year), if we give him 9,000 times on the 4th of this month, multiplying the base salary would give a salary of 180,000 yuan, which can still buy one shi of rice. If we give him 11,000 times on the 9th of this month, multiplying the base salary would give a salary of 220,000 yuan, which can also buy one shi of rice. However, if we give him the average of 10,000 times to multiply the base salary, then it would only be 200,000 yuan. On the 9th of this month, 200,000 yuan can only buy nine dou of rice.

Formula for Compiling the Index

The cost of living index should not be a mystery. It is a sacred scientific product. No one can manipulate it, and anyone can compile and calculate it themselves according to a certain formula. The calculation method is to find out the current prices of the following quantities of goods one by one, add them up, and use the sum as the dividend. Then, add up the prices during the price limit period of August 19 of last year and use the sum as the divisor. The quotient obtained is the cost of living index on the day you used the commodity prices. The current index is based on the worker's household survey conducted by the Public Concession of the Municipal Council in the 30th year of the Republic of China, which includes four categories and 54 items:

(1) Food Category

Xian rice 2.860 shi dou

Building without a patio 0.391 cubic feet base period consumption price in the 30th year of the Republic of China: 0.864 yuan in fiat currency

Building with a patio 0.483 cubic feet base period consumption price in the 30th year of the Republic of China: 1.330 yuan in fiat currency

(On March 22nd, the Shanghai Municipal Staff and Workers Cost of Living Index Compilation Group passed a resolution to remove corn, millet, salted pork, sweet potatoes, fermented bean curd, striped cloth, and flannelette, adding Shen Bao, movies, and women's long stockings.)

Various Demands for Salary Payment Methods

As for salaries not keeping up with commodity prices, there are many other reasons. For example, the date of salary payment is also a relatively serious issue. For example, if the index is published on the 31st, and the salary is not paid until the 4th of the following month, and commodity prices increase by 40% during these four days, then the salary you receive is discounted by 60%. Therefore, the General Labor Union formally calls for a weekly wage system, and even demands daily wage payments. There are also proposals for payment in kind or in silver yuan, so there are many different options.

### Yu Shuping Responds to the Lawyers Association's Objections to His Practice of Law

Yu Shuping, the former director of the Municipal Police Bureau, recently responded to the objections raised by the Shanghai Lawyers Association regarding his practice of law after leaving office. He stated that he had applied to the District Court and the High Court for registration in accordance with the provisions of the Lawyers Law and had submitted the approved registration documents to the Lawyers Association to apply for membership and to be issued a membership card. The membership card number is 1581, and it was received before the 5th of this month. The legal procedures have been completed, and there seems to be no problem with practicing law. As for whether police officers should also recuse themselves, Article 13 of the Implementing Regulations of the Lawyers Law has clear provisions. The judicial officers referred to therein do not include police officers other than prosecutors. At the same time, there are many former colleagues from the police bureau who have practiced law after leaving their positions, and no problems have occurred. It is hoped that the executives of the Lawyers Association will provide guidance in accordance with the law.

### A-League Football Game; Longtou Narrowly Defeats Zhichao

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the second round of the A-League football game between Longtou and Zhichao, Longtou narrowly defeated Zhichao by a score of 2-1 after a fierce battle of 90 minutes in strong winds. Longtou controlled the overall situation, adopting an offensive posture from beginning to end, but could not find a way to score. Five minutes before the end of the first half, Zheng Bingyi committed a foul in the penalty area and was penalized with a penalty kick. Qian Yuanqing scored with one shot, and Longtou actually conceded a goal first. In the second half, Longtou continued to attack fiercely in the tailwind, but struggled to find a shooting opportunity. Zhichao's entire army retreated to defend against the wind. Wu Qixiang led the three armies, fighting hard with their backs to the goal, and goalkeeper Sheng Peter was extremely busy. Finally, within 30 minutes, they scored two goals and turned defeat into victory. After the second goal, a defender kicked the ball with the wind, and Chen Qin deflected it into the net. The spring wind was strong, and it was cold and about to rain. The audience at Yiyuan was sparse, with fewer than 2,000 people. The game was chaotic. Although Longtou's kicking skills were solid, their coordination and communication were poor; otherwise, they would have won a major victory earlier. Zhichao's young players lacked skills, and Wu Qixiang could not support the building alone.

Longtou attacked first, and Shi Dafa shot out of bounds. Jiang Kun shot powerfully from 20 yards, and Xia Shufu headed the ball, missing by a hair. Zhichao counterattacked, and Xu Guoping backhanded a shot from 15 yards, which was caught by Yan Chengkuan. Longtou attacked again and was again caught by Sheng Peter. Longtou's offensive was fierce, but it failed to succeed. Wu Qixiang took the ball far out, and Guan Yongchang penetrated and hooked it. Yan Chengkuan jumped up to catch the ball and was knocked down by Wu Zhemin, who was penalized and sent off. Stalemated for 40 minutes, Longtou's misfortune came. Zheng Bingyi touched the ball with his hand in the penalty area, and Qian Yuanqing heavily penalized a penalty kick, shooting it into the bullseye. The score was one to zero, and Zhichao took the lead. Five minutes later, the first half ended.

The two teams fought again, and the Longtou generals vowed to recover the lost ground, attacking desperately. Zhichao's hinterland was severely ravaged. However, the forwards lacked the skill of finishing, failing repeatedly. Longtou killed so enthusiastically that the central defenders came out to assist in the battle. Zheng Bingyi kicked a long ball towards the goal, the ball landed and bounced, and Sheng Peter jumped up, but the ball had already entered the net. The score was tied. Zhichao's spirit waned, and Wang Burong took advantage of the situation again, plugging into the center. Chen Qin deflected it in close range, making it two to one, and Longtou took the lead. The silver horn sounded, and Longtou narrowly won by a score of 2-1.

### Power Company Statistics; Power Supply in Recent Months; Electricity for Lighting, Heating, and Industry; Increases Every Month

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to statistics from the Shanghai Power Company, the figures for the company's supply of electricity for lighting and heating to ordinary households in the city in recent months are as follows: In November of last year, lighting electricity was over 10.78 million degrees, and heating electricity was over 1.34 million degrees. In December, lighting electricity was over 11.94 million degrees, and heating electricity was over 1.50 million degrees. In January of this year, lighting electricity was over 13.15 million degrees, and heating electricity was over 1.65 million degrees. In February, lighting electricity was over 13.15 million degrees, and heating electricity was over 1.55 million degrees. March has not yet been finalized, but it is likely to be higher than February. These figures show that although electricity prices have been adjusted dynamically based on the base number, they have not had the effect of saving electricity for ordinary households. On the contrary, electricity consumption for lighting and heating has only increased. Furthermore, the industrial electricity supplied by the company was over 30.08 million degrees in November of last year and over 43 million degrees in December. In January of this year, it was over 46 million degrees. In February, due to more holidays during the Lunar New Year, it was over 41 million degrees. In March, it was over 50 million degrees. This shows that the need for electricity in the city's industry is increasing every month. Therefore, the saying that the city's industry is shrinking does not seem to be true. Furthermore, there are currently many troops stationed in the city, and most of them do not pay for the electricity they use for lighting and heating. The power company's loss from this is approximately 1% of its total revenue.
