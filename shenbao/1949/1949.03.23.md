### New Cabinet Actively Planning Peace Talks; Delegation Expected to Go to Peiping Early Next Month; Will First Discuss Most Fundamental Issues

[Our Newspaper, Nanking, 22nd] Peace negotiations with the Chinese Communists are clearly the most pressing issue for the current government and the people. Since the announcement of the new cabinet's formation, Acting President and Premier Ho Ying-chin have been busy preparing on the 22nd. It is reported that if things proceed quickly, the delegation is expected to go to Peiping in early April. An authoritative source said that this delegation will be responsible for substantive negotiations, the situation being similar to the Double Tenth talks in the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945], with the Kuomintang and the Communists each sending representatives to first discuss the most fundamental issues and decide on matters concerning the civil war, then convene a new Political Consultative Conference (PCC) and invite third-party figures to participate, jointly discussing all political issues after peace. The government representatives, accepting their mission to Peiping, will not attend with full power of representation, that is, when each issue is discussed to the final stage, they will reserve the right to sign, deciding after reporting to Nanking in Peiping. This approach will benefit both the representatives and the government. As for the underlying principles of this trip to Peiping for negotiations, they are based on the peace outline drafted by the Ten-Person Committee, which in turn was based on Mao Zedong's eight conditions. However, the current peace outline is still a draft and needs to be revised and improved. An authoritative source expressed concern about this, because some pro-war figures, such as so-and-so, believe that basing it on the eight conditions is unacceptable, and if that is the case, there will inevitably be many hidden reefs in the future peace talks. When the reporter discussed the issue of abolishing the constitution and legal system with an authoritative source, he said that the most reasonable approach is to establish another institution after the future new PCC is convened, to convene a new National Assembly to undertake the revision of the new constitution. Regarding the reorganization of the army, the source expressed the opinion that we ultimately want to adopt the army reorganization model of Shenyang, Changchun, and Tianjin, or the army reorganization model of Peiping. Moreover, a comprehensive peace negotiation must be better than the army reorganization of Peiping. The source further commented on the current situation, saying that many pro-war figures clearly do not believe that their own strength is sufficient to defeat the other side and advocate war. Being unable to continue fighting is a fact, so peace negotiations should begin immediately. The source especially said that in the current peace talks, the government must obviously make concessions, because the conditions of the Communist authorities are very clear. The Communists are waiting for the government to sue for peace, so in future negotiations, there will inevitably be some issues that government officials consider inappropriate, but peace talks are inevitable, a fact, and the future of peace talks is bleak, which cannot be denied.

### Twenty-One Legislators' Emergency Motion; Request the Government to Urge the Communists; To Quickly Send Representatives and Designate a Location

[Our Newspaper, Nanking, 22nd] The Legislative Yuan passed a resolution on the afternoon of the 22nd, urging the government to telegram the Communists to quickly send representatives and designate a location to begin peace talks. The motion was proposed by Yang Bu-ping and twenty-one others as a temporary emergency motion, and there were no opponents in the entire session. The motion included two supplementary measures, one being that the government should quickly strengthen the delegation of peace talks, and the other being that the government should immediately telegram the Communists to send representatives and designate a location to begin peace talks. Someone said that the word "strengthen" in "strengthen the delegation of peace talks" was inappropriate. The chairman then announced that the motion was passed without objection, and appointed five members, along with the original proposers, to be responsible for organizing the text and report to the next Yuan meeting.

[United Press, Nanking, 22nd] It is reported that Acting President Li's representative in Peiping, Huang Chi-han, today communicated with the President's Office via wireless telephone, urging the appointment of a peace delegation as soon as possible. Huang said he believed the Communists were preparing to start negotiations and were only waiting for the appointment of the government's peace delegation.

###傅秉常's Remarks

Undecided Whether to Take Office as Foreign Minister

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 22nd] I recently interviewed Ambassador Fu Bing-chang, who said that he was not aware of his appointment as foreign minister beforehand, and only learned of it this morning after receiving notification from the new Premier of the Executive Yuan, Ho Ying-chin. He is still considering this new position and has not yet decided whether to accept it.

[Our Newspaper, Nanking, 22nd] Former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Shao Lizi told reporters on the 22nd regarding Fu Bing-chang's appointment as foreign minister: Fu has been stationed in the Soviet Union for five or six years and is extremely familiar with the Soviet Union's political situation and its attitude towards China. Fu's appointment as foreign minister will surely enable us to achieve a balance in our diplomatic policies towards the United States and the Soviet Union. Regarding the rumor that Shao will succeed Fu after Fu returns to China, the reporter asked Shao about this. According to Shao: The authorities have not mentioned this matter to me, but someone mentioned it to me before. I am unwilling to consider it before the national policy is decided. Shao's words indicate that if the national policy is anti-Soviet, he does not intend to consider this matter. If the national policy changes to emphasize both the United States and the Soviet Union, Shao should consider it. Premier Ho telegraphed Fu Bing-chang on the 21st, urging him to return to China to take office immediately, while the affairs of the embassy will be temporarily handled by the counselor of the embassy. Fu's return to China is expected in a week at the earliest, and half a month at the latest.

### Rumor of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters Moving to Chengdu; Guo Jijiang Dismisses it as Groundless

[Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 22nd] According to Gansu Chairman Guo Jijiang's words to the reporter: The rumor that the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters will move to Chengdu is purely groundless.

### General Labor Union Requests Restoration of Social Administration Organizations

[Central News Agency, Nanking, 22nd] An Tingfu, Managing Director of the National Confederation of Trade Unions of the Republic of China, declared at a press conference held in Nanking on the afternoon of the 22nd that the 5 million workers across the country opposed the abolition of the Ministry of Social Affairs in the Legislative Yuan's passage of the bill to simplify the structure of the Executive Yuan. He said that the Ministry of Social Affairs is the government's leading agency for social administration. In the past, the national labor movement relied on its leadership. After the abolition of this agency, the direction of the labor movement will lose its basis. According to the Legislative Yuan's bill to simplify the structure of the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Social Affairs will be abolished and merged into the Ministry of Interior. An Tingfu pointed out that this is a sign that the government does not attach importance to the social movement. At a time when democratic freedom is fighting against class dictatorship and the system of enslaving the people, the social movement is extremely important. He further stated that the National Confederation of Trade Unions, in accordance with the request of the national labor force, requests the government to restore the establishment of a social administration agency in the Executive Yuan. Shui Xiangyun and other Managing Directors of the National Confederation of Trade Unions separately petitioned Acting President Li, Premier Ho, and President Tong on the 22nd regarding this matter, and the heads of each state expressed that they would consider this issue.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 22nd] The Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Trade Unions telegraphed the central government on the 22nd, requesting the establishment of a Ministry of Labor.

### The Democratic Socialist Party Holds a Central Standing Committee Meeting in Shanghai; Decides Not to Participate in the Executive Yuan; Issues a Declaration Asking the Kuomintang and the Communists to Abandon Old Grievances; The Youth Party Declares Support for Premier Ho

[Our Newspaper Report] The Democratic Socialist Party held its 47th Central Standing Committee meeting yesterday, deciding not to participate in the Executive Yuan. The meeting was chaired by Xu Fulin, who read out Premier Ho's original letter inviting members to join the cabinet, and then discussed whether to participate in the Executive Yuan. Jiang Yuntian first reported on his visit to Nanking to meet Acting President Li and Premier Ho, and then the discussion began. It was generally agreed that Ho Ying-chin's appointment as Premier of the Executive Yuan was the most appropriate choice, but the organization of the new cabinet did not yet have the basis for cooperation among the parties, so it was not planned to participate. However, Zhang Junmai, due to the sincere invitation of Acting President Li and Premier Ho, still intends to go to Nanking in the short term if his health improves. The Democratic Socialist Party also issued a declaration on the current situation with the establishment of the new cabinet, stating its position and appealing to both sides to abandon old grievances and seek a rational and emotional solution in a calm and peaceful spirit.

### Situation in Central China Not Yet Severely Felt; National Army in Southern Henan Captures Luo Mountain; Communist Army in the Henan-Hubei Border Region Moves Towards Eastern Hubei

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 22nd] According to the observation of a military authority: As of today, the Communist army has not shown any active signs of attacking the southern section of the Peiping-Hankou Railway. Even the Communist army moving south to eastern Hubei has not exceeded 30,000 people. Therefore, the current situation in central China has not been severely threatened. General observations outside may be overly sensitive.

[Our Newspaper, Xinyang, 22nd] Military news: Under the command of General Zhang Zhen, a certain powerful unit, in coordination with a certain regiment of Unit "3677", captured Luo Mountain County at 5:00 PM yesterday. The more than 1,000 Communist troops in the city have been driven away.

[Our Newspaper, Xinyang, 22nd] Military news: More than 20,000 troops from Liu Bocheng's Communist army, gathered in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui border region, are moving towards Luotian and Yingshan in eastern Hubei. A portion of Chen Geng's corps, concentrated in Shangcheng, Gushi, Huangchuan, and Guangshan in southern Henan, is moving southeast. It is reported that this Communist army may establish an advanced base in the Dabie Mountain area to attack Wuhan and prepare to cross the Yangtze River on the north bank of eastern Hubei. The transportation platoons continuously driving south along the Xin (Cai)-Huang (Chuan) highway in recent days have mostly arrived in Gushi. Two or three detachments of Liu's army are currently stationed there, training very diligently.

[Our Newspaper, Xinyang, 21st] Two thousand vehicles of the Communist army's baggage train, full of war materials, were found on the Xincai to Guangshan highway, heading towards the Henan-Hubei border, including two tanks.

[Our Newspaper, Xinyang, 21st] After the National Army strengthened its defenses in the southern section of the Peiping-Hankou Railway, the local Communists near Guangshui Xiaogan have all fled east. When the reporter inspected Guangshui, he witnessed that the people in the area

[Agence France-Presse, Hankou, 22nd] The future of the National Government, the determination of its fate, seems to be currently in concentrating its best troops, under the command of General Bai Chongxi, in the Wuhan area. General Bai will defend his troops at the intersection of the Yangtze River and the Yuehan Railway, waiting for the progress of the Communist army, or convene peace talks. According to observers: He is very willing for the peace talks to be held, because his strength is not enough to make him win a decisive victory, but it allows him to occupy an important position in the peace talks. He seems to have deployed his troops and can command the provinces within his power. For example, Zhang Gan commands the military north of Wuhan, Xia Wei is stationed in Anqing, and Zhang Zhen commands the military in southern Henan. After the adjustment of the armies by Bai Chongxi in mid-February, it seems that he has greatly consolidated his position. According to military experts: General Bai Chongxi's army has about 150,000 local troops and 150,000 national troops, distributed along the 700-kilometer area along the Yangtze River and controlling the 250-kilometer Peiping-Hankou Railway. The National Army, especially the most elite Guangxi Army, is well-equipped, including several divisions that are fully motorized and equipped with American equipment. Military personnel in Hankou believe that although Lin Biao's Communist army has appeared in the area south of Xuzhou, they believe that a general offensive by the Communist army may not be possible for the time being. Although eliminating an army commanded by Bai would be a major loss for the National Army, the price for the Communist Party would also be very high. So far, the Communist army has only conducted small-scale reconnaissance battles in the area downstream of Wuhan. It is heard that a Communist army column has gone to Macheng, sixty kilometers east of Hankou. According to military sources, its purpose is only to scout the area along the Yangtze River in northern Hubei. The other 200,000 regular Communist troops in southern Henan are holding against Bai Chongxi's army without any action. Although there is war in the east of the Peiping-Hankou Railway, commerce has not stopped. In 1948, 80 million pounds of tobacco were still transported from the Communist area of Henan Province to Hubei in exchange for agricultural products. According to recent news, barter trade is taking place under the permission of the generals of both sides.

### Communist Army in Jiangnan Increases Columns; Northern Army Reaches Solid Regiment; Recent Positions Have Changed

[Our Newspaper, Wujin, 22nd] The strength of the Communist army in the Jiangnan area of northern Jiangsu is increasing, and its movements are even more busy. According to information up to the 19th, in addition to the southward movement of the 13th Column being confirmed, the military has also determined the positions of the Liangguang and 9th Columns based on intelligence. Counting the units found in the past, the main force of the Communist army east of the Grand Canal line, west of the Tongyu line, and south of the Dongtai Taixian Yangzhou line has reached more than eight columns. According to National Army returnees, the Communist army has reorganized these more than eight columns into three corps, namely the 7th, 9th, and 10th Corps. Among them, the 9th Corps governs the 1st, 4th, and 9th Columns, and the 10th Corps governs the 10th, 11th, 12th, and Liangguang Columns. The serial numbers of the units under the command of the 3rd Corps are still under investigation. The location of the headquarters of the three corps is approximately in Zhaixian, Rugao, and Nantong. The positions of the columns are as follows: The 1st Column is between Yiling and Xiannvmiao, west of Taixian. A follow-up unit of this unit is on the line from Xiannvmiao north to Shaobo. According to prisoners, this unit will still move towards Taixian. The 4th Column is on the Hekou Taixian line. The 9th Column is between Jingjiang and Xinzhen (about 30 li south of Taixing). The 10th Column is in Huangqiao, Taixing. The 11th Column is still in the north and south of Rugao. The 12th Column has reached near Nantong. The Liangguang Column is going north along the Tongyu line and has reached Fuan, Dongtai (about 30 li northeast of Hai'an). This unit was originally stationed in Huaiyin. The more than 20,000 people discovered by the Air Force previously should be this unit. The Changjiang Column is still divided into two parts, one stationed in Nantong and the other stationed in Jiangyan. As for the unconfirmed 13th Column, it is said to have been transferred to the line between Shizhuang (about 50 li south of Rugao) and Jijiashi (about 20 li northeast of Jingjiang). According to intelligence obtained yesterday, the 10th Column has shown signs of fleeing north to Jiangyan, while the 12th Column seems to be moving west from Nantong to the original position of the 10th Column.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 22nd] After the Communist army's organization changed from "column" to "army," the military here has learned the new serial numbers of the three Communist army columns in northern Jiangsu. The 1st Column has been changed to the 20th Army, the 4th Column has been changed to the 23rd Army, and the 13th Column has been changed to the 31st Army.

### Legislative Yuan Discusses Financial Issues: Yang Baodong Proposes Issuing National Salvation Public Bonds, Readjustment of Railway Freight Rates and Postal and Telegraph Rates Referred for Re-Examination

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The seventh meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan was held at 9:30 a.m. on the 22nd. Chairman Tong Guanxian announced the report matters: "The President's communication that the Executive Yuan submitted a request to promulgate the financial reform plan based on the Temporary Provisions of the Constitution, which has been promulgated by this government, is submitted for your information." This immediately aroused opposition from some members, who believed that the implementation of the reform plan was harmful and not beneficial to the people's livelihood, and the Legislative Yuan could not remain silent. It was decided to discuss it together with the "Request to the government to promptly change and correct the financial reform plan" proposed by Zhu Huiqing. Then, the discussion matters proceeded. Regarding the Executive Yuan's submission of the review opinions on the method of adjusting railway, postal, and telegraph rates and fees according to the cost index, as well as related implementation methods and trial operation situations, the members raised various opinions. The review opinion advocates that railway freight rates and telegraph fees should be based on the "August 19th" price as the basis, and calculated according to the government's announced cost of living index for civil servants. Adjustments to postal rates must be implemented only after discussion by the Legislative Yuan. It is proposed that the price increase be implemented from April 1st. Opponents said that the original method proposed by the Executive Yuan was based on scientific methods, while the review opinion ignored this point. The prices of transportation undertakings should take into account the materials required and the costs. The price difference between the review opinion and the original proposal is too large, and for the sake of prudence, this case should be referred for re-examination. The meeting passed a resolution to have the original review team conduct the review. The discussion continued on Yang Baodong's proposal to issue special national salvation public bonds to stabilize the currency system and prices, establish economic credibility, and stabilize social life, in order to save the country from its difficulties. The opinion of the Procedure Committee was to hand it over to the Finance Committee for review, but the majority of the members advocated retention. After a vote, although a majority of 103 people agreed to retain it, because there were only 142 people present, which was less than the legal quorum, it was changed to be voted on again in the afternoon. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 p.m. The afternoon session continued, and the legal quorum was only reached at 4:00 p.m., and the discussion on the issuance of national salvation public bonds continued. Some people advocated that there was no need to retain it and that it could be handed over for review. After a vote was proposed, it was found that there were only 13 members present, which was less than the legal quorum, and no vote could be taken. It was decided to leave it for the next meeting. Afterwards, the discussion was on Kong Geng and others' proposal to re-amend the standard for clearing bank deposits in war zones, Li Shijun and others' proposal to the Executive Yuan to quickly form a national property inventory organization to conduct a thorough investigation in groups, Meng Yunqiao and others' proposal to simplify provincial-level administrative agencies, and Wang Zemin and others' proposal to formulate a reform plan based on facts. All were passed without objection and handed over to the relevant committees for review according to the opinion of the Procedure Committee. The remaining cases were not discussed, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The Procedure Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting at 6:00 p.m. on the 22nd to discuss the agenda for the next meeting. In addition to the five cases that were not fully discussed at the Yuan meeting on the 22nd, the newly listed items include Tang Siyao and others' proposal to organize a political research committee for innovation to innovate political affairs (to be discussed together with the outline for political innovation). Zhang Jingyu and others proposed amending the Central Bank Law to meet the current needs, so as to rectify the bank and seek financial stability. Lian Mou and others proposed that the temporary measures for military and public personnel and tourists entering Taiwan Province violate the Constitution, deprive people of their freedom of residence, movement, and action, restrict traffic, divide unity, and should be submitted to the Executive Yuan for repeal to facilitate merchants and travelers, etc. (There is also news about the Legislative Yuan on page 2)

### Editorial: He Cabinet's Financial Policy

The He cabinet, which the whole country has been anticipating, was born on the 21st after a week of preparation. The heads of the eight ministries and one commission, as well as the seven ministers without portfolio, have also been appointed and announced by Acting President Li. Looking at the lineup of the He cabinet, it seems to have made significant progress and has a new atmosphere, which naturally increases the people's expectations for the He cabinet, which is not surprising. According to our newspaper's Nanjing report, the He cabinet is scheduled to hold its first joint cabinet meeting in the coming days to discuss the new cabinet's policy guidelines. It is said that the main points are to earnestly promote the following four goals: (1) Seek peace; (2) Political innovation; (3) Stabilize the economy; (4) Secure people's livelihood.

These four policy guidelines, judging from the words, are exactly what the people urgently expect from the government. In today's gloomy political atmosphere, the guiding principles of Xuanzheng really do not need to be high-sounding. Rather than aiming too high and talking empty words, and issuing checks that cannot be cashed, which only disappoint the people, it is better to be practical and say things honestly and do things earnestly. "Where there's a will, there's a way." As long as there is sincerity and perseverance, any difficulty can be overcome. Taking these four policy guidelines as an example, this newspaper has repeatedly discussed seeking peace and innovation, and this article does not want to add anything. However, regarding the two items of stabilizing the economy and securing people's livelihood, we cannot but point out that this is where President He's unique insight lies.

At the beginning of President He's mission to form a cabinet, he had long had the intention of taking the social policies implemented by the British Labour Party cabinet as an example. Because after the victory against Japan, President He was ordered to go abroad to participate in the United Nations Chiefs of Staff meeting, and he must have had a deep understanding of the democratic system and social policies of Britain and the United States. This time, as the premier of the Executive Yuan, he will surely be able to implement the economic policies of the Three People's Principles to fulfill his long-cherished wish. At the same time, we must also point out that today's Chinese people, affected by currency inflation, are living in deep water and burning fire. Once they hear that President He's policy guidelines are to stabilize the economy and secure people's livelihood, it is like hearing the gospel, who would not cheer and rejoice? The problem in the future lies in how to realize this stability and security.

Standing in the position of the people, we cannot but pay special attention to the new financial policies of the He cabinet. Under the current situation, whether it is the national finance or the personal economy, it is almost at the end of its rope, but it may not be without a new realm of bright prospects. In the past two months, prices have indeed been rising, but if the former Finance Minister Xu Kan had not resolutely taken out his set of methods to deal with the emergency, I am afraid that there would not be such tranquility today. It is said that after the new Finance Minister Liu Gongyun takes office, he will make further improvements to the current measures to remedy the defects and formulate a new set of methods. Naturally, we hope that the methods will become better and better, so that the people's lives can be relieved. In terms of the talents of the new cabinet, Finance Minister Liu is the current president of the Central Bank, and can also be said to be the current de facto finance minister. The current finance seems to have not seen new measures other than throwing gold to inflate prices, buying and selling foreign exchange certificates, and printing a large amount of banknotes, which shows that the real power of finance is in the hands of the Central Bank. Therefore, Finance Minister Liu's financial policy will probably not have a major turnaround of eighty or ninety degrees. As for the Minister of Economic Affairs, Sun Yueqi, he is also the original director of the Resources Committee, and of course there are old chapters to follow. With the recommendation of Zhang Jia'ao and Weng Wenhao, Liu and Sun took the stage and should display their new plans to comfort the people's expectations.

Some may think that the current financial policy will undergo fundamental changes. "Change when you are poor" is certainly a good phenomenon, but the most important thing is to "get through when you change," and not to make things worse by changing. When President Bao arrived in Beijing from Shanghai, he told reporters: "I am like a blank sheet of paper when it comes to economic policy." This can indeed show President He's humble attitude, but it is also enough to show that President He still needs experts to study and draft a complete set of methods for the current economic crisis. We do not know what the new cabinet's methods will be today, but there is a general saying that the way to save the economic crisis, in addition to paying attention to the branch and leaf problems, the most important thing is to establish the general policy of "making the rich pay." If it cannot be taken from the rich and used for the common people, then not only will "economic equality" not be achieved, but the goal of "economic socialization" will not be achieved, and the current national treasury revenue and expenditure will inevitably be countless. There is no way to save the current economic crisis, let alone restore the people's lost hearts. What the people of the whole country expect from the He cabinet to use new people to implement new policies is mainly this point. Therefore, how the new financial plan is not only can show whether the He cabinet's policy guidelines are heading towards the goal of improving people's livelihood, but also the quality of the He cabinet can be seen from here.

### The Fire on the Chongqing Warship is Extinguished: The Air Force Flew to Huludao Again Yesterday for Reconnaissance: The Eighth Squadron Completed its Mission and Returned to Beijing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] At 9:00 a.m. on the 22nd, an air force reconnaissance plane went to the sky over Huludao again to investigate the situation of the Chongqing warship. The pilot of the plane, Hu Cuiting, made his third flight to Huludao. According to what he saw, the bottom of the warship was turned over even more severely. The part of the oil depot that caught fire burned for two days and two nights. With the intrusion of seawater, the fire was extinguished, and Huludao was unusually quiet. Mr. Hu mentioned that when he flew over the warship in Huludao on the 18th and 19th, he saw flashes of light on the ship (the muzzle flashes of the intense anti-aircraft fire). The sky was filled with exploding shells, and the island clouds showed one ball after another. It was truly a tense war scene. When the aircrew went to bomb for the third time on the 20th, the ship did not react to the artillery fire. Even the five anti-aircraft guns on land in Huludao were withdrawn, fearing that they would be affected. Mr. Hu originally wanted to go with his wife Gao Xuemei to watch the movie "Snow in Red", but missed the show because he talked to the reporter about the situation in Huludao.

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 22nd] The Eighth Squadron of the Acting Army, led by Commander Chen Jiashang, returned to Beijing on the morning of the 21st.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Military personnel added comments on the Battle of Chongqing: The Battle of Chongqing shows that naval warships have no aircraft protection. Once they encounter air raids, they will inevitably go to destruction. If the Communist Party had fighters this time, they would definitely use them to prevent the National Army bomber group from approaching. Because the Communist Army lacks air force, the bombing of Chongqing is still a test of pure bombing technology and accuracy. Also because the Communist Army has no air force, the planes that went to bomb were able to form a formation to fly to the sky over Huludao and then enter with a single plane from the air to drop bombs. Furthermore, because the bombing technology was sophisticated, and each bomb used created a 30-foot diameter crater, the damage to the ship's surface was too great (the Chongqing's deck was only 51 feet wide), so the Chongqing was hit by bullets, caught fire and exploded, tilted and turned over, and then it was inevitable that it would sink. However, because the general understanding of the role of the air force is not very clear, after the Chongqing was bombed, the general response was alarming. In fact, those who understand the power of the air force had long expected this ordinary ending after the Chongqing slipped away.

### Legislators Demand that Responsible Authorities Report on the Chongqing Warship Incident and Explain the Disappearance of Wang Lingyun

The case incidentally mentioned the Commander Wang Lingyun of the Sui District, who "disappeared" in Zhijiang, and also asked the military authorities to explain. According to reports: "It is also heard that Wang Lingyun, commander of the 13th Pacification District, has disappeared. The details of his disappearance should also be reported at the same time, so that everyone can understand the actual situation on the military side recently. Please question the amount of mass at that time, and trace the whereabouts of various incidents."

### Remuneration for Judicial Personnel; Remedial Measures Planned; Six Months of Living Allowance Issued at Once

The above three points have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and have been contracted with the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance.

### If Atlantic Treaty Signatories are Attacked; The United States Will Not Hesitate to Go to War; Danish Foreign Minister Leeb Receives Assurance; Sfuosa Emphasizes the Defensive Nature of the Treaty

[Our Dispatch] New York 22nd Broadcasting: Copenhagen News, The Danish government assured the parliament today that when the North Atlantic Treaty signatory countries are attacked, the United States will immediately go to war. Today, Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen told the parliament when requesting authorization from the government to sign the North Atlantic Treaty: "If the signatory countries of the treaty encounter armed attacks, the only consequence is: the United States will go to war. The Danish government is certain that the United States has provided its commitment." All military force to assist the attacked country" But Mr. Lai also said that the US Constitution and the Danish Constitution have the same point, that is, the declaration of war must first be approved by the parliament. Mr. Lai also announced that he had discussed the status of the Geeling Chan base with Secretary of State Acheson in Washington. Mr. Ai strongly requested that if this base is used, it will be purely for defensive purposes and will never be used for offensive purposes. Mr. Lai denied the rumor that the Danish government is willing to sell Luoling Er in exchange for artillery, and said, "We have not sold Geeling Pass, and Geeling is not for sale." In Mr. Lai's speech, some people in the gallery shouted "Long live the Soviet Union."

[Reuters, Rome, 21st] The Senate debated the Atlantic Treaty today. Foreign Minister Sfuosa came to the meeting to defend the treaty, stating that if Italy wants to continue to work for peace and maintain its security, it has no other way but to participate in the Atlantic Treaty. After World War II, only the Western powers have disarmed, while the Soviet Union quickly colluded with Eastern European countries to establish military agreements with them. The agreements between the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries and between Eastern European countries not only regard the actual aggression as the cause of the war, but also regard the threat of aggression as the cause of the war, and there are many flexibilities in interpreting these so-called threats. Therefore, since Eastern Europe has first formed a group, Western countries have to seek countermeasures. If the Soviet Union has no intention of dividing Europe, the Soviet Union can join the Marshall Plan from the beginning. Mr. Shi repeatedly emphasized that Italy has never received any request to establish a base in Italy, and the Italian government has never expressed its intention to supply a base. When Mr. Shi explained the relationship between Italy and the Atlantic Treaty, a communist member shouted "We have really entered heaven now." Mr. Shi immediately replied, "At least we have escaped from hell."

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 21st] In Ravello, Calabria, police and demonstrators against the Atlantic Treaty clashed today, resulting in injuries to seven citizens and four police officers.

### Southeast Asia and Mediterranean Regions; Defense Agreements in the Works; The United States Maintains a Watchful Eye on the Far East Situation

[Reuters, London, 21st] Deputy Minister Meixiu told members of the House of Commons today that, to his knowledge, no regional convention other than the Atlantic Convention is under negotiation.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] Washington political commentators do not believe the rumor that the US government will decide to establish the Pacific Convention immediately after the Senate approves the Atlantic Convention, saying that the United States has a number of military bases in the Pacific and its position in Japan is extremely solid. However, at present, the White House and the State Department hold a watchful policy towards the Far East, especially China, because the situation in China is in "flux."

[Reuters, London, 22nd] The idea of establishing regional conventions around the world first became the basis for discussing long-term policies at the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Meeting in October last year. Today, due to the announcement of the Atlantic Convention and the victory of the Chinese Communist Party, all non-communist countries in the world have realized that it is impossible to stabilize their own position without establishing a collective regional security system to resist the continuous expansion of communist forces. After the failure of efforts to cooperate with the Soviet Union to rebuild the world after the war, the establishment of regional agreements began to brew. The first to become a reality was the Western European Union. The Atlantic Union is just to expand the Western European Union to both sides of the North Atlantic. The foundation work for regional agreements in the Mediterranean and Southeast Asia has also begun. During their recent visit to London, the foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey outlined their views on the Mediterranean regional convention to the British Foreign Office. Turkish Foreign Minister Shadak believes that the Mediterranean Convention can be divided into two stages. The first stage includes the countries of Turkey, Greece, Italy, France, and Britain. The second step includes the countries around the Mediterranean. He believes that the Middle East situation must be stabilized before discussions on the regional convention including countries around the Mediterranean can begin. Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris believes that discussions on the Mediterranean Convention can begin immediately without delay. He also divides the establishment of the Mediterranean Convention into two stages: the first stage is the same as the Turkish Foreign Minister; the second stage, he advocates including the countries in the first stage as well as Iran, Pakistan, and the Arab countries. Although the United Kingdom expressed sympathy for the views of the two countries, it hoped that the Atlantic Convention would be approved before the Mediterranean Convention began negotiations. So far, the British government has not formally expressed whether it intends to join the Mediterranean Human Rights Convention as a Mediterranean power, which is an extremely important decision. The Mediterranean Convention hoped by the two Greek countries intends to use Britain as the key to linking the Mediterranean Convention and the Atlantic Convention. As far as the situation in Southeast Asia is concerned, although the United States has not been involved there, it seems to be very concerned about the conclusion of the Southeast Asia Regional Convention. The achievements of the CCP on the mainland of China and the suspicion of the strategic position of Japan by American strategists have made the United States feel the threat of the rapid expansion of communism. Due to the active communist forces in Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam, Indonesia, etc., and the lurking crisis within the borders of Nepal, the British Commonwealth Conference convened by India in February to discuss the situation in Myanmar is of great significance. India's adoption of decisive measures against domestic communism shows that India is not only an anti-imperialist, but also a firm anti-communist country.

### Japan Hopes the Pacific Convention; Can be Signed Quickly

Eden Arrives in India en Route Home

[Reuters, Aijing, 22nd] Mrs. Jin Teng, Deputy Minister of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said: She hopes that the United States, Australia, and other countries in the Pacific region and the Far East will form a Pacific defense convention similar to the Atlantic Convention together with Japan to protect the security of freedom-loving countries in the Pacific region. The sooner this agreement is concluded, the better. At present, whether it is the victorious country or the defeated country, it should abandon prejudice and unite to maintain peace.

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 25th] British Conservative Party Deputy Leader Eden arrived here from Singapore last night and is scheduled to leave here the day after tomorrow via Karachi to return to England.

### US Military Aid Plan for Europe to be Reviewed by Congress

President Truman Requests Discretionary Power

[Washington, 21st (Reuters)] It is reported that as the military aid plan for Europe is presented to Congress, President Truman will request Congress to grant him broad discretionary power in deciding the allocation of military supplies to Europe. He hopes that Congress will not strictly stipulate the amount of aid to each country. He will request Congress to approve a total amount, and then, based on the State Department's recommendations, he will make the allocations himself. This system would allow for responses to any emergencies that may arise. It is currently estimated that this plan will cost between ten and fifteen billion dollars in the first year, with the hope of raising European military strength to an effective level within this range. Once the Atlantic Pact is submitted to Congress for approval at the beginning of next month, this military aid plan for Europe will be prepared for congressional review. Vincent, Chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, has indicated that the House is unlikely to object to the proposal.

### Soviet Union Employs Delaying Tactics in Austrian Treaty Negotiations; Britain and the US Grow Impatient

[Report from our newspaper] London, 22nd Broadcast: British representative Manjouk stated at the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers that Britain is increasingly losing patience with the tactics employed by the Soviet Union in discussing the Austrian peace treaty. Other Western representatives also accused the Soviet Union of simply delaying the current negotiations. They said that the Soviet representative, Sarupin, is using various tactics to avoid reaching a resolution and is prolonging the discussion at the end of the meeting without making any progress. Western representatives have learned that Mr. Sarupin has been appointed as the Soviet representative to the next United Nations General Assembly, but he has not informed the other representatives that he will be leaving in a few days. The Western representatives find it puzzling that Mr. Sarupin is simultaneously seeking to continue the meeting but is unwilling to make any concessions.

### Results of French Provincial Council Elections Announced Last Night; Centrist Parties Achieve Major Victory; Second Round of Voting Scheduled for Sunday

[Paris, 21st (Associated Press)] The final results of the French local elections were announced tonight, with the parties supporting the centrist government of Guy Mollet winning. However, General de Gaulle achieved a personal victory record. De Gaulle's French People's Party received 25.34% of the total votes, the Communist Party received 23.54%, and the government parties received 51.12%.

Neutral observers say that Guy Mollet's moderate, pro-American government has strengthened its position through the first round of voting. Both de Gaulle's party and the Communist Party want to overthrow the current government, but they have different goals and hate each other, so both sides are suffering. Of the 1,508 local council seats, only 723 were won by a majority of votes this time, including 536 for the government parties, 170 for de Gaulle's party, and 17 for the Communist Party. The remaining 785 seats will be elected next Sunday among the candidates who received the second-most votes.

[Paris, 21st (Agence France-Presse)] The victory or defeat of each party in the election of local council representatives will depend on the results of the second round of voting to be held on Sunday. The statistical report from yesterday already offers a glimpse into the current trends of French political opinion. All parties that did not win are now saying that they are still confident of victory in the second round of voting. Observers emphasize that the French people are now mostly unwilling to be drawn into risky politics. The parties that were most popular before the war are now gradually recovering the positions they lost during the turbulent period after liberation. This is a victory for the centrist parties.

[Paris, 21st (Agence France-Presse)] The Communist Party issued a statement tonight stating that in the second round of voting for the French local elections on the 27th, Communist voters will only vote for candidates who have criticized the Atlantic Pact. The statement denounced the pact as an "important tool for preparing for World War III." The second round of voting will be held in areas where no candidate received a majority of votes in yesterday's election. In that election, only a majority was required.

### Improvement in the Method of Compiling the Index; Three Items Decided in the Subcommittee Meeting of the Compilation and Review Committee; Quantities, Types, and Techniques Are All Revised

[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Living Index Compilation and Review Subcommittee Meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM in the Municipal Government Conference Room, chaired by Mr. Chu Yifei, Director of the Municipal Government Statistics Office. Attendees included Mr. Jin Runxiang and Mr. Tian Heqing from the Municipal Industrial Association, Mr. Liang Yongzhang, Mr. Fang Rusheng, and Mr. Sun Wenyuan from the General Labor Union, Mr. Wang Naixu from the Municipal Council, Mr. Liu Jingquan from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Mr. Cao Peizi and Mr. Shen Ding from the Social Affairs Bureau. The meeting continued to discuss various issues related to the compilation of the index and adjourned at around 7:00 PM. Regarding the improvement of the compilation of the living index, three items were discussed and resolved as follows: (1) Quantity Issues - In the past, under the items for compiling the living index, some were calculated in a mixed way. A. For example, for 7.5 dou of rice, half was calculated at the subsidized price and the other half at the market price. From now on, it should be changed to calculate 2 dou at the subsidized price, and the rest at the market price. B. The cost of electricity was previously calculated at 10 degrees, now it should be changed to 30 degrees. C. The streetcar fare was previously calculated at the third-class fare, now it should be changed to the first-class fare. D. Rent should be adjusted once a month. (2) Type Issues - When the living index was previously published, it was divided into two types: for office workers and for laborers. Now that it has been merged into one type, the items originally under the office worker category, such as newspapers, movies, and long stockings, should still be included in the calculation. (3) Technical Issues - In the past, price surveys often became disconnected from market prices. This should be avoided as much as possible in the future. It was decided that the price survey dates for the first half of the month should be the 4th, 8th, 12th, and 14th. The dates for the second half of the month should be the 19th, 27th, and 30th. The above resolutions will be submitted to the Compilation and Review Committee for review and approval, and then submitted to the Mayor for approval and implementation.

[Report from our newspaper] According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, amidst widespread rumors that Mayor Wu Guozhen is determined to resign, there is still a glimmer of hope that could retain the Mayor, namely, temporarily granting him a leave of absence for one or two months. It is understood that various parties are currently making every effort to retain the Mayor, and the central government also believes that after approving Mr. Wu's resignation, it would be difficult to find a suitable successor in Shanghai under such difficult circumstances. Therefore, it is generally speculated that Mayor Wu's resignation is still unlikely to materialize. It is possible that he will temporarily take a leave of absence from April 1, and then return to Shanghai to continue serving the citizens. All those who care about Mr. Wu believe that the vacation is important for him. Curing malignant malaria is certainly the biggest reason, but the excessive fatigue of his political duties is also a fact. Since Mr. Wu has been the Mayor of Shanghai for three years, he has never had a proper vacation to separate himself from municipal affairs, and his mind and body are exhausted. If he does not rest in time, his physical strength will inevitably be unsustainable. As for the rumors that Mayor Wu will join the cabinet after his resignation, it is impossible. The reason why he is asking to resign is to seek an opportunity to rest. Considering the development of the situation, it is difficult to find a new mayor, so Mr. Wu's resignation is still unlikely to become a reality for the time being. However, it is possible that he will temporarily take leave from April 1 for a considerable period.

### Director of Finance Bureau's Resignation Not Approved; Mayor Wu Grants Him Five Days of Leave

[Report from our newspaper] Mr. Tian Yongqian, Director of the Finance Bureau, has requested to resign due to hemoptysis, but his resignation has not been approved. Starting yesterday, Mayor Wu temporarily granted him five days of leave to recuperate. However, since the newly promoted Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau, Mr. Qian Jianfu, was absent from the bureau due to the death of his father, Director Tian still went to the bureau to work. According to what Director Tian told reporters yesterday, his intention to resign has been decided, and he will follow the Mayor, whether it is approved or not. After the five-day leave is over, he will apply for another leave.

Although Miss Liu's ancestral home is in Fujian, she was born in Europe when her father, Liu Chongjie, served as the Minister to Germany. After that, she studied in Germany and other parts of Europe, so she is proficient in German, English, and French, as well as various local dialects such as Mandarin, Cantonese, and Shanghainese. In recent years, she has appeared as the main receptionist at various receptions, cocktail parties, and dances hosted by Mayor Wu for foreign guests. Her intelligence and competence have attracted attention from all sides.

### Primary and Secondary School Teachers in the City Discuss Treatment Issues; Decide to Request Four Points from the Central Government; Send Representatives to Nanjing to Petition

[Report from our newspaper] The Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers Association held a joint meeting yesterday afternoon at Yucai Middle School. The meeting discussed the issue of treatment and decided to send a telegram in the name of the Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers Association to Acting President Li, Premier He of the Executive Yuan, and President Tong of the Legislative Yuan, calling for improved living standards and requesting four points: (1) The February salaries should be quickly supplemented according to the local living index for that month. (2) Starting in March, the treatment of public school teachers should be calculated according to the local living index for that month. The salary base should be based on each person's original fixed salary. (3) The local authorities in charge of public school teachers should first issue salaries according to the previous month's salary amount before the 5th of each month, and then supplement the balance within five days after the index for that month is announced. (4) In-kind allocations should continue to be issued monthly. Food oil and coal balls that have been owed in the past should be ordered by the competent ministries and commissions to be cleared before the end of this month. It was also decided that each municipal primary and secondary school would send two representatives to Beijing to petition Acting President Li and the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan. The date of the trip to Beijing will be decided after consulting Mayor Wu today.

Call on the Mayor Today to Request Four Points

At 10:00 AM this morning, representatives Xi Zhen, Li Zhanren, and others will call on Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government, in addition to seeking instructions on the petition to Beijing, and request: 1. Please issue 1,000 times the salary before the 25th of this month. 2. Please quickly allocate the owed in-kind allocations of coal balls and food oil, otherwise, please issue the difference in cash according to the market price. 3. Issue welfare rice to respond to the grain storage campaign.

The meeting yesterday also decided that each municipal primary and secondary school would send two representatives to contact the Shanghai District National College and University Professors Association and the Staff Association. The Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers Association will also convene representative conferences on a regular basis. The next joint meeting is scheduled to be held at Qingcai Middle School on the afternoon of the 24th.

### The Presidents of Major Colleges and Universities Collectively Telegraph the Ministry of Education Requesting Tuition Fee for Staff

[Our Newspaper's Report] The presidents of various national colleges and universities in the Shanghai area, on behalf of their school staff, jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Education, stating: "The staff members of national colleges and universities in Shanghai have organized a fellowship association to appeal to the presidents of various institutions, roughly stating that the base salaries of general staff are relatively low, and they do not receive academic research funds or overtime pay, nor can they hold concurrent jobs or classes outside the school. They work diligently throughout the year, without winter or summer vacations. This time, the academic research fees for teachers have been generally increased to four levels: two hundred, one hundred fifty, one hundred, and fifty yuan. However, full-time staff members, in addition to their fixed salaries, do not receive any similar subsidies. Serving the school together, there is a significant difference in treatment, which is somewhat unfair. With meager salaries, it is truly impossible to support a family. Please consider issuing full-time staff members a 'tuition fee' in the name of academic advancement, referring to the amount of research funds received by lecturers and teaching assistants (i.e., fifty to one hundred yuan), to maintain their livelihoods, etc. The statements made are indeed factual. An investigation reveals that the number of full-time staff members in each school is relatively small, and the amount of tuition fees is not large. To avoid imbalance, it is indeed necessary to provide some assistance. We are forwarding this request and earnestly hope for your consideration and approval."

[Another Report] The Shanghai Area National College and University Staff Fellowship Association has approved the Henan University Staff Association as a member. Recently, it has received telegrams from the Hangzhou National Academy of Art and the Suzhou Social Education College applying for membership, which will be discussed at the next board meeting.

Students Appeal to All Parties for Protection

### A Young Woman Misses the Mayor and Boldly Visits Him to Inquire About His Health, but Is Stopped by Guards

She Smiled Before Speaking, Her Situation Was Quite Mysterious

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday at 4:00 PM, a young woman named Ding Yonghui went to the City Government Building to see Mayor Wu and inquire about his health. The woman was wearing a dark green silk cheongsam, cloth shoes, and holding a National School Teacher Qualification Registration Certificate issued by the Bureau of Education. She went straight to the mayor's office but was stopped by the guards outside the mayor's office. She immediately presented the National School Teacher Certificate and asked the guards to forward it, saying that the mayor would definitely summon her after seeing the certificate. The guards accompanied her to the Protocol Section for consultation. According to the woman, she told the person in charge of the Protocol Section that she knew from the newspaper that Mayor Wu had contracted malignant malaria and missed him very much, so she came to visit him. The Protocol Section thought that the woman was not acquainted with the mayor and suspected that she was mentally disturbed by her words and actions, so they told her that the mayor was very busy at the moment and had no time to see her. However, the woman still refused to leave and sat quietly on the long bench outside the mayor's office. She waited there for half an hour and left in disappointment when she saw that no one was paying attention to her. When the reporter asked her what she wanted to see the mayor about, she replied, "Of course, I have something to say, but I can't tell you." She smiled before she spoke, and the smile was always on her face, looking very happy. The woman was about thirty years old, with a very upright appearance, and spoke in the Shaoxing dialect, so it is speculated that she might be from Shaoxing.

### The University Professors Fellowship Association Repeatedly Telegraphs Requesting Salary Based on the Index. It Is Hoped That the Difficult Situation Will Not Force Them to Make Further Statements.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Area National College and University Professors Fellowship Association yesterday telegraphed the government again to appeal on the issue of livelihood. At the meeting of this association on the 14th of this month, the issues of organizing and dispatching representatives for petitions and joint strikes were discussed and decided to be temporarily reserved. Now that the new cabinet has been established, the association hopes that it can quickly seek a fundamental solution. The situation is difficult, and it is hoped that they will not be forced to make further statements. This will be discussed again at the meeting on the 27th.

The full text of the association's telegram to the government yesterday is as follows: "To Acting President Li, Premier He of the Executive Yuan, and Minister Kang of the Ministry of Education: We previously sent a telegram, which we believe has been noted, but we have not yet received a reply, and we are very apprehensive. Currently, prices are jumping several times a day. The cost of living index for workers in Shanghai has reached 1,339 times zero points in the first half of this month, and the price index has reached over 1,556 times. The salaries of our colleagues in February are only 75 times after a 24% discount, which is a huge difference. Even with the 500 times compensation that the presidents of various colleges and universities brought back to issue at the beginning of this month after a 24% discount, it is still insufficient. This month will soon be over, and the salaries of our colleagues have not been issued yet. Please issue them immediately based on the local price index for this month, without any discounts, to maintain our livelihoods. Please also follow the usual practice and issue six months of funding for storage based on the current month's multiples so that we can overdraw and issue them at any time according to the current month's index, to avoid delays and further distress. If there are practical difficulties in allocating large amounts of gold yuan, please change to issuing silver dollars on a monthly basis according to the original salary as a fundamental improvement. According to the presidents of various colleges and universities, the ministry said in a telegram that the funding for March should still be handled according to the central government's regulations. Former Acting Minister Chen had promised the presidents that the salaries of teachers and staff would be issued according to 500, which our colleagues received after a 24% discount, which was already extremely small compared to the prices at the time. To go back on this small amount of money, how can we show great faith to the world? Now that the new cabinet has been established, we believe that it should reform the consistent sloppy style to comfort the hopes of the world. The lives of our colleagues are truly extremely difficult and unbearable. The situation is difficult, and we hope that we will not be forced to make further statements. Furthermore, the public funding for students is very meager, and the self-funded students have mostly lost their financial support due to the war, and their lives are equally painful. Please improve this situation quickly to avoid further problems. We urgently plead for your understanding. The Shanghai Area National College and University Professors Fellowship Association respectfully appeals."

### The Section Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau Inspects Barber Shops to Determine the Pricing Base to Ensure Fairness and Reasonableness

The base pricing for barber shops in this city will be implemented soon. The social and political party bureaus believe that the determination of the base price is related to the daily life burden of citizens in the future and are handling it carefully. It is learned that Mr. Xi Yongzhi, the section chief of the Social Affairs and Price Control Section, went out yesterday to inspect barber shops of all levels in this city, including Nanjing Barber Shop, White Rose, Wufu Chengji on Nanjing Road, White Peony on Xizang Road, Damei Xiejie on Huanghe Road, Liu Lihua on Guling Road, and many other barbershops in the alleys, to investigate the barbering prices before the war and the current barbering prices. In general, the prices before the war ranged from 1.7 yuan to 0.1 yuan, and the current prices range from 5,000 to 700 gold yuan (alley vendors). After obtaining the survey data, Mr. Xi will use it as a reasonable standard for determining the base price.

### The Bureau of Education Arranges for the Registration of North China Refugee Students

After the reversal of the situation in North China, young students flocked to the south.

In addition, a group of Northeast refugee students is scheduled to take the Qiujin Wheel to Guangzhou this morning to request the Ministry of Education to find a way to borrow a school to study.

### A Young Girl Was Arrested and Prosecuted for Using Counterfeit U.S. Dollar Drafts

[Our Newspaper's Report] On January 26 of this year, a young girl named Sun Silan presented two insured drafts from the Bank of America, one for 550 U.S. dollars and one for 7,300 U.S. dollars, to the Chase Bank in this city for cashing.

It was found that Adomar had no legitimate occupation and specialized in counterfeiting banknotes. The investigation of this case has been completed and transferred to the District Court for prosecution for the crime of counterfeiting valuable securities.

### Light Punishment for Man Detained for Unsuccessful Dollar Transaction

On March 12, at around 5 p.m., a Russian named An Te We Wan was buying and selling 20 U.S. dollars with a silver dollar vendor named Zhang Jinrong at the intersection of South Shaanxi Road and Central Linsen Road when he was discovered by police officers from the Changshu Road Police Sub-bureau. Both were detained and questioned. According to the Russian An Te's confession, he was not selling U.S. dollars, but because he needed money for living expenses, he intended to sell the 20 U.S. dollars he had. He did not know that selling U.S. dollars should be done with the Central Bank and that private buying and selling was a violation of the law. According to Zhang Jinrong's confession, he was indeed making silver dollar transactions due to the pressure of life. Because the Russian mistakenly thought that he was a U.S. dollar vendor, he was answering An Te's question about the price of U.S. dollars when he was arrested. The police bureau now believes that the transaction was not successful and the circumstances are light, so they are tentatively allowing a light punishment in accordance with Article 54, Item 11 of the Statute on Punishment of Violations of Public Security.

### Brothers Commit Robbery Out of Resentment for Unsuccessful Loan

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhao Meisheng, a resident of 61 Guangming Village, Hefei Road, had a friend named Ye Xibiao who had previously asked him for a loan unsuccessfully, resulting in a grudge. After returning home, he discussed a plan to deal with him with his brother, Xilong. On the afternoon of the 18th, at around 4 p.m., he went to rob with his brother. First, his brother Xilong stepped forward and knocked on the door. When he was in the kitchen, he asked Zhao's wife, Zhao Xiuying, "Is Brother Meisheng at home?" She replied that he had gone out. Xilong then grabbed an oil bottle and violently struck Zhao's wife on the head, causing her to faint on the spot. Xibiao followed and entered, helping his brother to remove a gold ring from Zhao's wife's hand. At this time, Zhao's wife regained consciousness slightly and shouted loudly. The police officer on duty outside heard the sound and arrived. Xibiao took the opportunity to escape, and only Xilong was captured and taken to the Songshan Road Police Sub-bureau for questioning. After verification, he will be transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation.

### Police Bureau Driver on Trial for Allegedly Defrauding Money

[Our Newspaper's Report] Shen Jiagen, also known as Ji Wenbin, who worked as a driver in the police bureau, learned in July last year that Zhu Ronghua had purchased some stolen iron chains from the Bureau of Supplies from Dai Songzhou, part of which was seized at the North Sichuan Road Police Sub-bureau.

Zhu first paid 30 million, but Shen failed to retrieve the iron chains for Zhu, so Zhu accused Shen of intending to defraud. The District Court concluded the trial yesterday and scheduled the verdict for the 28th.

### The Leader of the Broadsword Gang Was Sentenced to Death by Firing Squad

The Police Bureau Ordered Its Subordinates to Report the Detailed List

The Criminal Division of the Police Bureau has recently decided to thoroughly crack down on the Broadsword Gang, which endangers public security. The head of the Criminal Division, Zheng Tingxian, has ordered his subordinates and the judicial sections of each sub-bureau to provide a detailed list of all the leaders and criminals of the Broadsword Gang in this city and submit it to the General Bureau within two weeks. He then ordered all relevant personnel to mobilize together, arrest them at the same time, and immediately execute the leaders of the Broadsword Gang who command the actions by firing squad. The gang members will be severely punished separately, depending on the severity of their circumstances. It is learned that the number of names on the Broadsword Gang blacklist is extremely alarming. It is said that there are more than a thousand important figures listed on the blacklist.

[Another Report] The Chief of the City Police Bureau has ordered a strict crackdown on local thugs, vagrant soldiers, and Broadsword Gang members.

### The Dismembered Male Corpse Found on Jinji Road Most Likely Came from the North. The Police Bureau is Investigating Clues from the Transportation Industry.

[Our Newspaper's Report] After the major case of the dismembered male corpse found on Jinji Road in West Shanghai, yesterday, Cheng Yikuan, the Chief of the Changshu Road Police Sub-bureau, personally led Chen Fenglin, the head of the Criminal Division, and various capable police officers to the scene and related places to conduct investigations throughout the day. It is heard that many extremely important clues have been obtained. According to general observation, although the murderer's disposal of the corpse in this case is even more cruel than the box corpse case at the North Station, according to the theory of criminology, criminal methods often have an imitative effect. It has now been determined that the time when the murderer committed the crime was not long before the time of the corpse dumping. Since the box corpse case occurred two weeks before, the murderer's motive for dismembering the corpse may have been influenced by this. Moreover, according to various signs at the scene, it is speculated that the principal offender or accomplice in this case is not someone without experience in medicine, anatomy, and slaughtering methods. Otherwise, cutting off bones and flesh with knives and axes could not be so neat and clean, and it is obvious that they can follow the rules of dissecting human or animal bone structures. Furthermore, the newspaper inside the corpse-containing package and the slip of paper inside the woman's jacket, which contained the corpse, are enough to prove that the murderer is an intellectual, or at least has received a considerable amount of education. The phrase "Those who have hatred with me, can be forgotten but not remembered" on the slip of paper, considering the tone, is between seemingly understandable and unintelligible, and may have been deliberately written. At the same time, all the words were printed in No. 6 lead type, rather than handwritten, which fully illustrates that the perpetrator had used wisdom, carefully considered the pros and cons, and meticulously planned the arrangement under the principle of leaving no traces. Based on the above conclusions, the main clues have generally appeared. In addition, Mr. Cheng Yikuan, who is currently in charge of the investigation, is a famous scholar who was previously sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States to study crime and investigation, and is now the leading expert in criminology in our country. He has solved major cases many times during his tenure as the captain of the criminal police brigade. All parties believe that he will be able to use skilled scientific methods to solve this "corpse-wrapping" case in a short period of time.

The Yellow Wrapped Luggage Bag is Definitely Not a Local Product

[Another Report] Regarding this cruel murder case, as of yesterday, although there was no obvious progress on the surface, according to the examination of the corpse, it has been determined that the deceased was from the North, in addition to the age and height. At the same time, after research, it was also determined that the yellow wrap and luggage bag containing the corpse were definitely not produced locally and most likely came from the North. Therefore, the murderer in this case may have deliberately created a smokescreen, dismembering the deceased in another city and transporting them to Shanghai. Another speculation is that the murderer first designed to lure the deceased to a remote area of this city, harmed them, and then dismembered them before moving the corpse to Jinji Road in the middle of the night. Therefore, in addition to requesting the Railway Bureau to mobilize railway police and employees to assist in tracking down passengers who carried similar yellow wrapped luggage bags on passenger cars in the past two days, the police bureau also asked the rickshaw, tricycle, and taxi associations in this city to investigate possible clues to solve the case.

The Changshu Police Sub-bureau Checks Household Registration in Its Jurisdiction

In addition, the Changshu Police Sub-bureau mobilized all police officers last night to conduct a thorough investigation of household registration in its jurisdiction. The bureau believes that the woman's jacket and the child's open-crotch pants are definitely related to the case. In short, the police bureau, in view of the increasing number of cases of destroying corpses and eliminating traces in this city, has also concentrated manpower and material resources to determine to expose the traitors and fugitives, and it is expected that the truth of this case will not be difficult to uncover in the short term.

### The Chief of the Songshan District Security Corps Falsely Reported the Number of Households and Embezzled Rice Ration Tickets and Fled After the Crime Was Discovered

In order to strengthen the investigation of rice rationing, the municipal food distribution office often sends personnel to work with investigators sent by the Economic Cooperation Sub-agency to conduct surprise inspections of rice stores in various districts. When they previously inspected the Dongtai Rice Store at 483 Jianguo East Road in the Songshan District, they found that Pang Bingyao, the chief of the 74th Security Corps in the district, had deposited 31 rice rationing tickets with key rationing certificates in the store, totaling three dan and one dou of rice. According to clues, they checked the sign-in register for the distribution of rice tickets in the corps and thoroughly investigated the households in the district. As a result, it was confirmed that Pang Bingyao, the chief of the corps, had indeed altered and falsely reported the number of households of Chen Mingxue, Yu Zhuang, Jin Yun, Ma Wangshi, and Chen A Da, embezzling 24 rice tickets. The office then transferred the case to the Municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs for referral to the court for handling. Unexpectedly, Pang Bingyao fled in fear of the crime. The court is now investigating and summoning relevant personnel to pursue the matter. The office also welcomes citizens to report such situations. If the investigation is true, they will be punished according to law.

### A Batch of White Russians and Jewish Immigrants Depart Shanghai by Ship on the 27th

It is heard that the police authorities of this city will separately ban the above situations as necessary.

If there is a cash shortage, half cash and half promissory notes will be issued.

### Porter Helps Reunite Lost Child; Railway Bureau Awards 40,000 Yuan

[Our Own Correspondent] On the 20th of last month, Wang Longyun's wife, a passenger, boarded a train from Zhenjiang to Shanghai that day. When boarding in Zhenjiang, she first sent her two daughters (one five years old, the other two years old and still in swaddling clothes) and luggage onto the train. The passenger then hurried to the restroom. By the time she reached the platform, the train had already departed, with her two daughters aboard. The passenger then took the next train to Shanghai and searched everywhere without success. She went to the Railway Bureau's Police Department to report the incident and request assistance. It was later discovered that the two young girls had been taken to Danyang Station by the on-board railway police and handed over to Xu Baichun, a porter numbered fifteen at Danyang Station, and Wan Shunjun, a porter numbered forty-five, and their wives, to be cared for. Because the children were still being breastfed and were ill, doctors and wet nurses were hired to provide medical care and nursing. Many new clothes were also made for the children, incurring significant expenses over the course of twenty-odd days. By the 15th of this month, the children had recovered, and it had also been determined that they were Wang Longyun's lost children. The Jingxi Section Fifth Precinct of the Police Department dispatched railway police to escort Xu Baichun and others' wives, carrying the two young girls, to the Police Department. They were handed over to their original parent, who provided a guarantee to reclaim them. The Railway Bureau, recognizing that the wives of porters Xu Baichun and others, despite being rural women, were enthusiastic in caring for the lost children and demonstrated commendable public spirit and righteousness, and to promote the enthusiasm of employees and their families in serving the public, issued a bonus of 40,000 yuan to each person as an incentive.

### Young Woman Claims Abandonment by Husband; Demands Over Four Thousand Loads of Rice

[Our Own Correspondent] Tang Lizhen came to Shanghai in 1938 and worked as a helper at the Quit Smoking Hospital at 44 Tongchun Lane, Baike Road. In June 1946, Zhu Youyuan, the hospital accountant, seeing her youth and beauty, seduced her in every way and incited her to divorce her husband. Subsequently, Tang became pregnant and had to quit her job, relying on Zhu for a living. In 1947, she gave birth to a daughter. At the end of November last year, Zhu's eldest son, Zhu Jinian, found out about the affair and sent his father back to his hometown of Ningbo. Tang, with no means of support, sued Zhu for abandonment and also accused Zhu Jinian of hiding his father, demanding alimony and maintenance in the amount of 4,256 loads of white rice. Yesterday, the district court held a hearing. Zhu, being in his hometown, was unable to attend, and his eldest son appeared in court. Judge Ge Jianong of the district court ruled that, since the main defendant, Zhu Youyuan, had not appeared, the case would be rescheduled for further hearing.

### Forgery and Fraud; Shen Weijie, Teacher at Fisheries Administration School, Sentenced to One Year and Two Months; Zhao Heming Fined 10,000 Yuan

[Our Own Correspondent] Shen Weijie, a teacher at the school for children of employees of the Fisheries Materials Management Office, took advantage of the absence of the school principal, Shi Zhaohan, last August to steal the school seal he was responsible for and forge letters of appointment in preparation for deception. On December 12th of last year, using the alias "Yang Haoran," he impersonated an auditor from the Municipal Finance Bureau, printing many business cards and commissioning a seal with the inscription "Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance Audit Completed" from a print shop run by Wu Xingsheng. He also borrowed money from Xu Rongchang, who borrowed 6,000 yuan and 7,000 yuan each from Zhao Heming in the form of checks dated December 13th from Qiankang Bank, where Zhao had no funds, and gave them to Shen. After obtaining these checks, Shen went to a carving shop run by Cai Jinming and commissioned a seal of "Zhao Heming" and a seal of the "Audit Section of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance." He falsely claimed that Zhao was the chief of the Audit Section of the Bureau of Finance and then went to Wanli Typing Company, where he asked Jiang Yueli to type fourteen "Audit Notices from the Bureau of Finance," affixing the forged seals. He went to the Xinxin First Restaurant, posing as a financial auditor to audit the books, and took the opportunity to borrow cash from Yang Shenrui, using the 6,000 yuan check of Zhao Heming as collateral, and obtained 2,000 yuan in cash, asking Yang to cash the check. Subsequently, in the same way, he went to Xie Da Xiang Cloth Shop, used a 7,000 yuan check of Zhao Heming, and exchanged it for 3,500 yuan in cash with Cao Laoxi of the shop. He also used the pretext of auditing to defraud Tang Huaimin of four checks from the New China Bank and cashed one of them for 500 gold yuan. He used the remaining three checks to obtain 500 yuan in cash each from Mo Minyao and Chen Nanchang. He also defrauded Zeng Guanlin of a 1,000 yuan check from the China Reclamation Bank. He then opened an account in the name of Zhao Heming at Chunmao Money Exchange, obtained checks, and then used them arbitrarily, defrauding more than ten merchants such as Hu Wenchao of cash. Because the checks were all rejected, they inquired at the Finance Bureau and realized they had been defrauded. They reported to the police, who arrested Shen and handed him over to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Zhao Heming, Bai Zuqian, Xu Rongchang, Jiang Yueli, Wu Xingsheng, Cai Jinming, and Shen were jointly prosecuted for the crime of forging official documents. Judge Zhu Huaping of the district court held several hearings. Yesterday, all the victims were brought to court for questioning. The defendant, Shen Weijie, initially tried to deny the above-mentioned criminal facts, but after the victims testified separately, he bowed his head in silence. The other defendants, Zhao Heming, Bai Zuqian, Xu Rongchang, Wu Xingsheng, and Cai Jinming, all denied colluding with Shen. Jiang Yueli claimed that typing the forged audit notices from the Finance Bureau was a work assignment from the company, and she did not directly negotiate or receive compensation from Shen. At this point, the case was clear. The court then pronounced the sentence: Shen Weijie forged official documents, harming the public, and was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. For the fraud part, he was sentenced to six months of imprisonment, to be served concurrently for a total of one year and two months. The other parts were found not guilty. Zhao Heming was fined 10,000 yuan for issuing bad checks. All other defendants were found not guilty.

### Cold Air Mass Condenses; Snow Pellets Fell Yesterday Morning

[Our Own Correspondent] Since the 4th of this month, the Siberian high pressure originating in North China has repeatedly pushed eastward. Because it borders and meets the strong tropical air current in the southwest in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the atmosphere has remained humid and persistent, resulting in cold and overcast weather in this city almost every day, with continuous rain and wind. From the 4th to last night, the rainfall in this city has reached 91.3 millimeters, or 3.60 inches, which is a relatively high record for early spring rainfall in recent years. Yesterday morning, due to excessive condensation of the cold air mass, snow pellets fell with the heavy rain for half an hour before stopping. The average daily temperature was only 40 degrees Fahrenheit, with a low of 3.7 degrees Celsius (38.3 degrees Fahrenheit) and a high of only 5.7 degrees Celsius (42.3 degrees Fahrenheit), making it unusually cold. According to the Meteorological Observatory's forecast, this type of weather may persist until around the Lunar Qingming Festival before it gradually stabilizes and becomes milder.

### A Picture of Family Exodus: Visiting Soldiers' Wives; The Future is Bleak, Sorrow Like the Sea

— Our Correspondent Liu Zao

[Nanchang, 19th] "Fields and gardens deserted after war, families scattered on the roads." These two lines of Bai Juyi seem to be a true portrayal of the circumstances of soldiers' families stranded in the rear, because they depict the hardship they are in. Since the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, more than 10,000 soldiers' families who have been moved from the front lines of Jinan, Xuzhou, and Bengbu to Nanchang, according to statistics from the Nanchang Military Dependents Reception Station of the Logistics Command. According to the regulations of the reception station, all military dependents who pass through can register at the station, where they will be cared for and given three days of free rest at designated hotels in Nanchang before going west or choosing their own residence, so the military dependents from the battlefield seen at the reception station are all in such a hurry to come and go.

However, among this group of evacuated military dependents, there is a group of wives and children who have no home to go to or have temporarily lost contact with their husbands, or whose husbands have died in battle, and even old grandfathers with white hair and wrinkled faces...now wandering in the ancient city of Hongdu.

This group of military dependents, whose future is bleak, totals more than fifty people, from Shanxi, Shandong, Kaifeng, and Xu-Bengbu. Apart from two "wives of colonels," the rest are the wives of lower-level cadres. They support the old and carry the young, traveling all over the Jiangnan Plain to Hongdu. When they recall the life of family reunion, clothing, food, and warmth in Kaifeng, Jinan, and other places, they cannot help but sigh at the cruelty of war and the livelihood of "the future is bleak, sorrow like the sea."

Floors as Beds

Now, they live in the rooms on the third and fourth floors of the Jiangxi Hotel. Because they are stranded dependents, they cannot afford the expensive room rates. Naturally, all tea and operations cannot be enjoyed in the same way as distinguished guests. More than a dozen people are squeezed into a small room one zhang square, and the broken floor is their bed. The window without glass is just right for the sunshine to shine in, warming the broken hearts of the soldiers' families. The house is filled with dilapidated luggage and the cries of hungry children, forming a picture of refugees.

Husband at the Front

In this turbulent life, do they miss their homes? Do they miss their husbands at the front? From every haggard face, from their incessant comforting of their children, there is not only a bone-deep longing like looking through the autumn water, but they also see their husbands coming back in their dreams at night. The wife of a platoon leader who fought at the front in Kaifeng said: On the eve of the fall of Kaifeng, her husband sent her to the city. The next day, this ancient city of Bian Dye was occupied by the Communist army. She fled to Nanjing, and then met the government's evacuation and came to Nanchang. Regarding the news of her husband, after all kinds of inquiries, she recently heard from a brother in the platoon that her husband had sacrificed on the Kaifeng battlefield. Similarly, three other wives also received this kind of bad news. However, from despair, they are still praying, thinking, and longing for their husbands to have a one-in-a-million chance of survival and relive their good dreams. A company commander of Huang Botao's corps recently escaped from the battlefield to Nanjing. He got news from a friend that his wife had escaped to Nanchang. When he came to Hongdu and reunited with his family, his wife seemed to have had a dream. When this tragedy was rewritten into a comedy, many wives shed tears of joy.

Livelihood Becomes a Problem

The gentlemen at the reception station gave special preferential treatment to this group of military dependents. First, they made an exception to the rule of temporary residence for three days, and also solved their problems such as illness, medicine, and two meals of vegetables, firewood, and charcoal a day. However, in today's rice-pearl-salary hanging, it is not easy to support the lives of this group of suffering wives for a long time with the money raised from all sides! How to settle their lives in the future has become a problem that cannot be sustained for a long time and needs to be solved urgently.

### Human Smuggling and Cargo Smuggling; Dantu and Zhenjiang Strictly Investigate

[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 20th] Since the blockade of the Zhenjiang river surface, it has not been long before human smuggling and cargo smuggling have made Sanshan uneasy. In addition to strictly investigating and handling smugglers in recent days, a large number of cargo ships smuggling occurred on the Dantu river surface on the 17th. The details are as follows:

Two steamships, "Shi Tai" and "Li Qun," towed nine medium-sized wooden boats loaded with pigs, wine, cottonseed, and other large quantities of goods, smuggled from the north to the south of the Yangtze River. When passing through the Dantu river surface, they were discovered by the garrison troops, who immediately seized them in the river and telegraphed for verification. According to the investigation results, the two steamships and nine wooden boats were hired by the district chief of the port area, Liang Qimin, from Xie Xing and Shengcheng companies. Three wooden boats were loaded with pigs, two with wine, and four with cottonseed, escorted by the merchant Meng Jikun. They departed from Longwokou on the night of the 11th of this month. The destination was Zhenjiang. Li Ridong was the representative of the receiving party in Zhenjiang. There were more than seventy people on the eleven ships. In addition to the owners of the "Shi Tai" and "Li Qun" steamships, Li Changming and Yang Tangyun, and the owners and partners of the wooden boats, the identities of the remaining passengers were mostly unknown. Among them were Chen Zhimin and Gu Zhengrong, soldiers of the Ministry of National Defense, who were equipped with certificates. The identity cards of other merchants and civilians were mostly outdated.

According to the person in charge of cargo transportation on the ship, this is a large-scale smuggling group with very meticulous planning. They spared no expense to establish close contacts with various checkpoints along the way from the Three Rivers Camp at the port to Sanjiangying, so they boldly moved forward. This batch was a tentative move. There were still more than forty large cargo ships moored in the Sanjiangying area, waiting to see how things went. If they could successfully reach Zhenjiang, they would continue to set off immediately.

The staff investigating this matter is unaware of whether there are contraband and weapons hidden in the cargo of the ship, and most of the passengers have unknown identities. They ordered the original ship to stop in the heart of the river and not allow it to land. They have reported the details to the Security Command and requested instructions. Yang Zongding, the deputy commander of the department, specially dispatched the City Defense Command and the Ship Control Station to Dantu on the morning of the 18th to conduct a strict inspection. They escorted the batch of ships to Zhenjiang late that night to await processing. It is heard that many important officials from relevant checkpoints are involved in this large-scale smuggling case, and the Provincial Security Department will severely punish this case.

There are still hundreds of fishing boats of various sizes moored along the Yangtze River in Zhenjiang. Since the authorities issued an order to block the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the livelihoods of many fishermen have been affected, and their livelihoods will be cut off. Several representatives were sent to the Zhenjiang Fishermen's Association a few days ago to appeal for relief. The association has submitted this kind of suffering to the county government and the garrisoned naval and army units, requesting them to consider the people's livelihood and stipulate the time and place for fishing, but it is still a question whether it can be approved.

### The Controversy of "Opening Wuzhou"

— Special Correspondent Liang Feng

[Report from Guangzhou, 19th of this month] On the third day after Acting President Li's Southern tour of Guangzhou, the forty-fifth cabinet meeting during Sun Ke's premiership passed an important resolution: to open Guangzhou and Wuzhou as treaty ports for foreign trade. This is a new record in the history of the Republic of China. After the government announced this measure, it immediately attracted great attention from the whole country, especially from people in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. However, due to their own interests, the people of Guangdong and Guangxi had two opposing views on this issue, resulting in intense controversy.

Viewpoints of the Opposition

In Guangdong, the strongest opposition came from the Guangdong-Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce, the Rice Grain Association, and labor unions such as the shipping and maritime workers' unions. They believe that once Wuzhou is opened, foreign goods will be directly dumped into the southwestern provinces through Wuzhou, and raw materials will be purchased at low prices, which will severely damage the industry and commerce of the southwestern provinces. The economic lifeline of the people in the southwestern provinces will also be completely squeezed dry. The most important issue is the loss of national sovereignty. They pointed out that from the perspective of the overall national policy, treaty ports should be limited to coastal areas, while Wuzhou is the heart of South China. Once the port of Wuzhou is opened, it not only violates the basic national policy, but also allows imperialism to penetrate deeper into our heart through trade, escorting, protecting overseas Chinese, merchant ships, and warships, step by step! If convenience of foreign trade is the reason, then Lanzhou, Guizhou, Chongqing, and even any region can be opened for this reason. The National Assembly has a resolution: "No opening of navigation rights for any reason." Moreover, China's industry and commerce are backward, and the current import surplus has affected the entire national economy. The consequences after opening up are even more unimaginable! Therefore, they say that they are purely standing on the position of national sovereignty to firmly oppose and protest to the end. If the request to the Executive Yuan to revoke this resolution is unsuccessful, they are prepared to appeal to the Legislative Yuan to achieve their goal.

Insisting on Opening Wuzhou

Conversely, in Guangxi, they request the government to open Wuzhou as soon as possible. Here, the written statement issued by the 23rd Standing Committee of the Guangxi Provincial Council on the 15th of this month, as well as the telegram to the central government, can be taken as representatives of their general opinion. Their reasons are: Wuzhou is the main port of entry and exit for South China. A large amount of local products from Guangxi Province and parts of Guizhou and Zhejiang provinces are directly transported to Hong Kong and Macau for sale through this port, accounting for about 8% to 28% of the national export volume. A large number of daily necessities are imported from Hong Kong and Macau and then distributed to the interior. According to pre-war statistics, Wuzhou Customs revenue ranked ninth among the 40 customs offices nationwide in terms of foreign trade. At the same time, the Guangzhou-Wuzhou route is 418 kilometers, and the Hong Kong-Wuzhou route is 432 kilometers, with little difference between them. However, all goods are now transported through Guangzhou for export, which increases transportation costs, delays the time, and increases costs, making it impossible for goods to flow smoothly, causing domestic production to shrink, and the people's livelihood to be greatly affected, which also reduces foreign exchange inflows and tax revenue, and the national finances and finance suffer losses. As for the issue of opening inland navigation rights leading to the loss of national sovereignty, they refuted that the unequal treaties have long been abolished, and tariffs can be determined independently. It is not comparable to the opening of treaty ports under duress by the late Qing Dynasty. Moreover, Guangzhou, Hankou, Changsha, and other inland commercial ports have long been established with customs offices, all of which can engage in foreign trade. Restoring Wuzhou's customs taxation authority and opening up foreign trade rights is beneficial to merchants and promotes the prosperity of the inland economy and increased production, which is not contradictory.

The Problem is Expanding

From the above examples, they each hold their own views and have their own reasons. However, precisely because each has their own reasons, this problem is almost expanding day by day. But then again, it is only for the sake of their own interests. Because after Wuzhou is opened, the most important thing in Guangxi is to increase tax revenue and prosper the local economy. But in Guangdong, because Wuzhou is an inland river port on the Xijiang River, it is the gateway from Guangdong to Guangxi. In the past, foreign goods entering the Southwest had to pass through Guangzhou as a transshipment station. Therefore, the opening of Wuzhou will first hit the shipping merchants in Guangdong and Guangzhou, followed by the joint ventures in Guangzhou and the southwestern provinces that regularly conduct foreign trade, and then Guangzhou's future grain supply will also be affected. They believe that Guangxi grain can escape to Hong Kong along with ordinary commodities, which is why the Guangzhou Rice Grain Association also opposes it. The former Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan said it well. He once told reporters: "This issue is very simple. The people of Guangdong are for the benefit of Guangdong, and the people of Guangxi are for the benefit of Guangxi, but in fact, it is all for the benefit of the country." So he also said: "The Executive Yuan already has a very good solution." However, he did not reveal this solution.

View of the Supervisory Committee Office

At the same time, the Joint Office of the Supervisory Committee in Guangdong and Guangxi also attaches great importance to this issue. What are the pros and cons? Will the opening of navigation rights affect our future sovereignty? What was the actual situation when this case was passed in the Executive Yuan? They have now sent people to investigate. According to Supervisory Committee member Zhang Jun, who went to Guangxi for inspection and returned to Guangzhou, Guangxi is unusually poor. The lives of military and government officials in the places he passed through were very difficult. However, to maintain local security, the local militia cannot be reduced, so the burden is heavy. Is the opening of the port of Wuzhou intended to increase tax revenue to make up for this? Therefore, it must now be submitted for investigation, and it can only be handled after the results are obtained.

However, although this issue is still developing in the active activities of both parties, anyway, they are all our own people, and I believe it will not lead to any serious consequences.

### The Distress of Guizhou Province

— Our Reporter Liu Mengchi

[Report from Guiyang, 16th of this month] "Three parts of spring color and two parts of sorrow, another round of wind and rain," this is a depiction of the early spring weather, a symbol of the current domestic situation, and even more so the mood of the Guizhou provincial authorities. Whenever Guizhou's political program is lost and it has no way to turn, it feels particularly distressed and at a loss compared to any neighboring province because of various restrictions imposed by geographical conditions and historical factors.

Speaking of the current political situation in Guizhou, in terms of route and style,

Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Hubei Provinces have long been prepared for changes since last winter. Because of the superior geographical, transportation, and economic conditions, they have always been favored by the central government. Their political distress is indeed much less than that of Guizhou. Sichuan and Yunnan provinces have always been known as "special circumstances." Precisely because of "special circumstances," whether in power or in opposition, they rarely make estimates when doing things. In other words, these two provinces seem complex but are actually simple. Only Guizhou is different. Its geographical location is between "major powers." It is difficult to serve both Qi and Chu. It strives to defend and support itself by being friendly and kind to its neighbors. It is already difficult enough to serve the great with the small. Moreover, the domestic situation has been depressed for a long time, and the situation between Hankou, Nanjing, and Guangzhou is even more difficult to see clearly. A veteran and important minister who has a long historical relationship with Xikou and is also an isolated and unfilial son is forced to clarify his position in this remote corner without soldiers, horses, or money. The extent of his distress can be imagined.

Guizhou is the Guizhou of the central government, and the central government is the central government of the Chinese people. With historical understanding and a spirit of great righteousness and integrity, taking out conscience to work for the central government of the Chinese people and for the central government's Guizhou, it is a steady way to hold the post, do more and talk less, and try to get through this difficult time. But in terms of the political situation in the province, it is also the development of the situation affecting people's hearts. The southwest of Guizhou is affected by banditry in the border areas of Yunnan and Guangxi, and the northeast of Guizhou is affected by banditry in the border areas of Sichuan and Hunan. In addition, years of war of resistance and suppression of the rebellion have left the people's livelihood devastated. The accumulated disasters have become larger and larger, and the cunning and resentful are clearly distinguished. The social security order in various places has always been difficult to restore. Military solutions make the people unafraid of death, not to mention that the local armed forces are not sound at all. Political solutions indulge evil and are enough to encourage wrongdoing. Using both methods at the same time does not seem to have any sustained effect. Do you not see the result of Ma Henglin, a provincial senator from Xiuwen, raising troops to rebel? In the end, he can only rely on military solutions. Speaking of Guizhou's

Finance and Economy Because it is barren and the people are poor, it is at a loss without the central government. Ninety-five percent of the provincial finances rely on central government funding. When public school teachers were paid twelve times their monthly salary, the entire province had to rely on the central government to allocate 5 billion yuan per year to cover expenses. Since March, it has been changed to paying salaries based on the cost of living index, and the amount of money required can be imagined. The shared tax between the central and local governments does not seem to be enough to cover the expenses of the tax collectors, and although efforts have been made to rectify and prevent tax evasion and corruption, slogans remain slogans, and those who engage in fraud and embezzlement are still everywhere. In particular, the central government recently decided that after the end of the 37th fiscal year for grain, grain requisitioning will no longer be carried out. The source of military and public grain in the future is indeed causing those in charge of finance to sigh at the roof. The provincial government recently reduced the amount of public grain received by each public school teacher per month from four shi dou to two shi dou, wanting to supplement public grain for military grain necessary for local armed forces in the future. This is what makes public school teachers complain the most about their future lives, but there is nothing they can do. In the past, in the era of warlords in Guizhou, the provincial finances relied on selling opium to make up for payments. Some time ago, someone suggested to the authorities that they might as well divide the province into districts to ban opium, some seriously and some slowly, and simply let the people grow opium. This would not only solve the problem of rural security in turmoil, but also make up for the provincial fiscal deficit. However, Chairman Gu has always been deeply disgusted with opium and resolutely opposed it, so the matter was dropped.

The most serious financial problem currently facing Guizhou is that the Guiyang branch of the Central Bank is unable to transport gold yuan notes to the province because the head office cannot print them in time. At the same time, Guizhou's transportation is inconvenient,

Cash Transportation is often plagued by the inability to provide relief. The Treasury Department often delays sending payment orders to the central and provincial government agencies in Guizhou for half a month or a month. Even if they are sent, the Central Bank has no cash to allocate. Such delays and disconnections are tantamount to the prelude to the disintegration of the entire financial system. No wonder the Guizhou Higher People's Court, the National Guizhou University, the Guizhou Normal University, the three medical colleges, and the provincial government often quarrel with the Central Bank in Guiyang over the allocation of funds, arguing until their faces turn red. When public school teachers finally manage to receive ten or twenty times their salary, prices have already jumped to fifty or a hundred times the previous level. Due to the extreme shortage of cash, the Central Bank is struggling to cope, so it issues large-denomination promissory notes of 10,000 and 50,000 yuan, creating a phenomenon where discounts on market transactions are as high as 70% to 80%. As a result, credit tightens, interest rates increase, prices skyrocket, and the people's lives become even more miserable. Everyone is saying that the gold yuan is following the old path of the legal tender, and the gold yuan is not as valuable as the legal tender. This pain is currently not unique to Guizhou province, but Guizhou, which relies on the central government to allocate gold yuan notes to assist it, of course, feels the pain even more.

If it were a province with abundant production and abundant resources, there would be no such distress. Places that have "nothing" always have to ask places that have "something." But Guizhou is not like that. Cotton cloth must rely on Hunan, hardware, electrical, and general merchandise must rely on Guangdong, and the food that the people cannot live without for a day relies purely on Sichuan. Guizhou people have to use money for everything

to buy from other provinces, but Guizhou people have no money. Chairman Gu Zhenglun has returned to Guizhou to take charge for almost a year. He has a deep understanding of the crux of the problem and advocates increasing production across the board to exchange Guizhou's tobacco, vegetables, tung oil, and other items for cotton yarn and salt from other provinces. Over the past year, this problem has remained the same and has not improved much. Take salt as an example: Sichuan salt is transported to Guizhou, the road is long and difficult, the capital tied up is too high, and there is collusion between officials and merchants for corruption. Therefore, it is advocated to designate Guizhou Province as a special sales area for salt, break the salt sales system, and allow the free and unhindered sale of Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Huai salt into Guizhou. Under this decision, the Guizhou Provincial Publicly Operated Products Transportation and Sales Company took the lead in obtaining a salt loan and has purchased and transported two batches of Guangdong salt from the Guangdong and Guangxi Salt Affairs Bureau to Guizhou, which the company directly distributes to the people of Guiyang for consumption. However, transporting salt from Guangzhou to Guiyang is not closer than transporting it from Sichuan. Purchasing and transporting Guangdong salt in Guangzhou, all prices are based on the Hong Kong dollar at the time. Purchasing and transporting it in Sichuan is based on the official fixed warehouse price in gold yuan. Guangdong salt to Guizhou is not "tofu transformed into meat price," but it is not as good as people's ideals.

Guangdong needs Guizhou's vegetables and tung oil the most. Last year, the Guizhou Provincial Products Transportation and Sales Company signed a contract with Song Ziwen's Guangdong Materials Adjustment Committee to

exchange materials at equal prices. The Guizhou Products Company has shipped more than 100 tons of vegetable oil to Guangzhou and plans to continue to ship tung oil, gallnuts, and American tobacco to exchange for some "foreign exchange." Unfortunately, it was not the right time. Song Ziwen fell, and the heart of the Materials Adjustment Committee stopped beating, so that the Guizhou Products Company still has three or four hundred large barrels of vegetable oil that cannot be transported. This is to say that Guizhou is also feeling deeply distressed in terms of material adjustment. Fortunately, Guizhou's

Local Armed Forces have gradually been strengthened. According to the person in charge, he is very confident that it will not be difficult to quell the clowns in various places in a short period of time. Even if the Communist army invades, an invading force of 30,000 to 50,000 people will not be difficult to drive out of the province. Guizhou currently has purely local armed forces, including seven provincial security regiments, seven independent battalions in the special commissioner districts, and 79 county militia standing companies. The two military districts in eastern and western Guizhou will each establish two to six supplementary regiments, and each can establish a modernized supplementary regiment. Recently, the Sixth Training Command newly organized the 98th Army, one army and two divisions, in Guizhou, stationed in northern and western Guizhou. Everything is borne by the Ministry of National Defense, but it can be used purely to ensure local security. Director Zhang Qun of the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters approved the advance replenishment of the weapons and ammunition of the local armed forces in Guizhou in order to comprehensively strengthen and complete the equipment of the local armed forces at the provincial and county levels. This is really enough to make the distressed Guizhou feel a smile.

Gu Zhenglun has always been unsmiling, and it seems even more so in recent months. We still feel that Guizhou is facing distress. He must feel the same way, so he encourages his subordinates to bury themselves in hard work, do more and talk less. He also put forward his "Outline of the Implementation Plan for the Central Work of the 38th Year" at the provincial government meeting yesterday (11th), taking "self-awareness, self-defense, self-government, and self-sufficiency" as its basic principles, being calm, and moving forward bravely. Guizhou's distress may be relieved in the near future.

### A Drop of Nectar of New Music Folk Song and Dance in Paradise

— Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

"Military-Civilian Cooperation Song" was also adopted by the American military. Now, Shu Mo's compilation is widely sung in the American army. Their lives are quite difficult, traveling around busily with very little pay. After the end of the War of Resistance, they continued to work in cultural positions, from Hankou to Nanjing, and from Nanjing to Hangzhou. This is a strong army on the cultural front.

[Report from Hangzhou, 20th of this month] When the infinite spring light comes to the West Lake, there is a very meaningful literary and artistic activity here, which is the "Spring Song and Dance Performance" of the Fourth Performing Troupe.

"Fourth Performing Troupe"

Speaking of the "Fourth Performing Troupe," this is a familiar name. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, they stood on the front line of the cultural war, fighting culturally against the enemy, Japan. They worked in the Fourth War Zone and spent a long time in Guilin, the "Cultural City" during the war. The leader, Wei Manqing, is a determined cultural worker. There is also a composer, Shu Mo, whose songs such as "You Naughty Thing" and "Military-Civilian Cooperation Song" have been sung by the vast majority of people. Moreover, it is worthy of our admiration and praise.

In Hangzhou, there have been many song and dance performances and many drama performances in the past, but this performance of theirs has shocked the entire Hangzhou. First of all, the Hangzhou newspapers have praised the success of their work with dedicated columns. At the same time, large groups of audience members have flocked to the place where they are performing. Again, many schools and organizations have requested them to perform once as a demonstration for future work. Why have they achieved such success? That is because their songs and dances express the voices of the people.

Simple and Beautiful Language

When Duanmu Hongliang and I discussed the definition of music with reporters, we felt that music is the purest Esperanto and the most beautiful and gorgeous language shared by mankind. How to make music an Esperanto? How to make music shared by mankind? That can only be done by approaching the people, living with the people, and extracting their true, good, and beautiful emotions, and then elaborating and creating. China is the earliest nation to recognize the value of music education. Unfortunately, it was later occupied by a few people, and the remaining folk songs that are about to be submerged. Now we should contact it, get close to it, and promote the true voice of the people. I remember that during the War of Resistance Against Japan, I met with the musician Sheng Jialun in the rear and we talked about the importance of people's music. He said, "Our opinions are very close! I am preparing to go deep into various remote areas to collect folk songs." Several times, we met with the musician Ma Sicong and also talked about this. He humbly asked me which of the music he played was the best? I told him that what I loved the most was "Tibetan Tone Poem" and "Suiyuan Suite." We discussed what the latest music is? The conclusion we reached is that the latest music should be in a form and content that is loved by the vast majority of people, should be understood by the vast majority of people, and the singers should be quite mellow. Yes, our previous music was spread among the people, making people feel free and happy in the life of music. Later, music was used as decoration and embellishment, and people's musical life was gradually abandoned. Now we must re-popularize music among the people so that the majority of people can enjoy it.

Exploration and Efforts

This performance of the Fourth Performing Troupe is in line with what we discussed. They perform the lives of the people in a new form. In the overall program, the chorus includes "Sun Yat-sen Memorial Song", "Reclaiming Spring Soil", "Farmer's Suffering", "Dawn is Coming", and "Rice Planting Ballad". The unison singing includes "Spring Comes to the World", "Welcoming Spring Ballad", "Melting Ice Song", and "Bad Wife", the male solo includes "Reclaiming Song", "Sending Big Brother", the male duet includes "Listen to Me", "Two In-Laws", the female solo includes "Miserable Daughter-in-Law", the male and female duet includes "Couple Duet", the folk dance includes "Driving a Cart to Find Her Husband" and "Aunt Wang Mending a Jar", and the dance includes "Jiarong Wine Party" and "Miao Dance". It can be said that the East of the people is completely moved to the stage. In these many songs and dances, the sorrows and hardships of the people are fully explained, but they have a rich vitality and a sincere and frank feeling. They are exploring and striving.

Walking a Path

What is especially valuable is that "Driving a Cart to Find Her Husband", accompaniment, dance, and singing have all reached a new realm of perfect art. Of course, they are not "musicians" who have drunk foreign water and specialize in singing Western songs, nor are they "musicians" who specialize in playing Western music with Western instruments. Their cultivation is not as good as "musicians", but their performances are so sincere. They are praised by an audience. They are a drop of nectar for irrigating new music in the future.

The overall situation is at a critical juncture where war and peace are undecided, and the people are in deep trouble. Coordinating with the arrival of spring, folk songs and dances are being performed in this paradise that already smells of gunpowder, which is of great significance. We hope that future art can follow this direction and work together.

### Recent Developments in Sichuan Politics After the "Rumor Wind"

— Our Correspondent Zhou Xueduan

[Chengdu Dispatch, April 14] After half a month of political turmoil and rumors in Sichuan, the situation seemingly cleared up with Zhang Qun taking office and calling for unity among the Sichuan-Kang generals. In the past few days, Zhang Qun went to Nanjing to attend the National Affairs Conference, taking with him a comprehensive plan for stabilizing the Southwest. Wang Lingji, Liu Wenhui, and Deng Xihou returned to Chengdu together to carry out their respective tasks. The political atmosphere in Chengdu seemed to shift from dazzling to calm. However, the provincial government suddenly adopted a series of extraordinary measures, drawing special attention from society. General observation suggests that the Sichuan political situation has now developed to its highest point in the process of transformation.

Self-Defense and Peace Negotiations: Various Deployments

The primary focus of Sichuan's current political affairs is the "self-defense and peace negotiations" sought by all levels of society, i.e., striving for comprehensive peace by strengthening its own capabilities. Recently, the situation in southern Shaanxi and northern Hubei has become tense, and new deployments have been made for Sichuan's defense. Sun Zhen, the Pacification Director of the Sichuan-Hubei Border Area, originally stationed in Yichang, has retreated to Liangshan and been reassigned as the Commander of the Central Sichuan Pacification Zone, commanding the armies of Sun Yuanliang and Luo Guangwen to guard eastern Sichuan. The 95th Army led by Huang Yin, originally under the command of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Border Area Pacification Headquarters, is stationed in Guangyuan, coordinating with the Hu Zongnan troops moving south from Hanzhong to defend northern Sichuan. For internal defense, the Sichuan province plans to organize seven Sichuan Defense Armies and expand twenty Security Regiments, coordinating with the seven National Defense Armies recently established in Sichuan by the central government, to serve as the basic force for self-defense and security in Sichuan. The provincial government is implementing a province-wide public self-defense training program, which has been fully launched in 144 cities and counties. The program involves a total of 4,336 brigades, 546,575 squads, and 1,762,935 people. Including self-defense cadres, the total number of people participating exceeds four million, and all the armed preparations will be completed within the next month. In addition, Sichuan has completed joint defense plans with neighboring provinces, including Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi, Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan, and Guizhou, establishing 23 joint defense organizations and 98 joint defense counties. Through months of deployments inside and outside the province, a copper wall and iron barrier has been built.

Personnel Changes: New Measures Adopted

In coordination with the self-defense and military expansion, the provincial government has recently taken two extraordinary measures. The first is a major reshuffle of personnel throughout Sichuan. In the first round on the 5th, 30 county magistrates, 63 tax bureau chiefs, and 9 land and food bureau chiefs were transferred. In the second round on the 9th, important personnel in 22 counties were changed. More than one hundred counties were affected in the half-month of political ups and downs. The inside story is left to speculation. The second is a major review of security regiments throughout Sichuan, personally presided over by Wang Lingji. In addition to the 3rd Security Regiment stationed in Songpan and Lixian being moved to Chengdu for inspection, Wang Lingji personally toured northern Sichuan with the deputy commander of the security forces, and then went to southern and central Sichuan to inspect various security regiments and supervise the training of local militias. Contrasting this with the telegram from the six security regiment commanders attacking the provincial government amidst the rumor wind of the Sichuan situation last month, it is generally believed that the significance of this inspection is not ordinary. These two measures happened right after the Sichuan political rumor storm. Wang Lingji stated that they were purely to strengthen the promotion of government affairs, but from the sidelines, it seems to contain a political and military rectification effect. At the same time, Wang Lingji openly criticized the widespread pamphlets and documents attacking him at the provincial government's monthly meeting on the 8th, pointing out that a few unscrupulous elements were deliberately creating trouble, and that he would thoroughly investigate and arrest them in his capacity as the commander of martial law. This shows that there are still undercurrents brewing in the Sichuan situation, and Wang Lingji is rectifying and preventing changes in the provincial government.

The Mainstream of Public Opinion Demands Stability

After ten years of separation and chaos, what the people of Sichuan unanimously seek is: peace, not war; change, not chaos. At the provincial government's monthly meeting, Wang Lingji reported that the central task of Sichuan province this year is first to seek security through self-defense, and second to seek progress in stability. Xiang Chuanyi, representing the provincial council, attended the Southwest Military and Political Conference, emphasizing four requirements: (1) seeking peace, (2) reforming politics, (3) reorganizing the economy, and (4) self-defense and self-rescue. However, the prerequisite for self-defense and stability is to seek unity first. Recently, the Sichuan political situation has been turbulent, and rumors have been spreading, partly due to uncoordinated actions. For example, the Kang troops were mobilized last month, the provincial government took measures this week, a small unit of Hu Zongnan's troops from southern Shaanxi was recently transferred to Yanting, Santai, and Zhongjiang for reorganization, and the newly formed national army freely recruited soldiers in various places, causing discord in the personnel of the Sichuan National Defense Army, etc. The inside story has caused outsiders to speculate endlessly, giving rumor-mongers an excuse. Currently, all parties are making various efforts to eliminate the invisible. For example, the provincial council telegraphed the central government to stop conscription, strictly prohibit free recruitment, and politely requested Hu's troops to postpone their reorganization in Sichuan, with the intention of reducing the complexity of the Sichuan political situation, first seeking internal stability and clarification, and then seeking unity and self-defense, in order to achieve the ultimate goal of joint defense and mutual assistance in the Southwest and jointly strive for comprehensive peace. This is the three-part harmony that all parties are conspiring to stabilize Sichuan, and it is also the correct measure that the people of Sichuan wholeheartedly support. With the impact of this mainstream of public opinion, all undercurrents will be submerged and eliminated without a doubt. The clarification of the Sichuan situation will be seen in a short period of time.

### 7-Year-Old Girl Abducted, 12 Years of Living Hell: Young Woman Seeking Relatives, Desperately Seeking Escape from the Sea of Suffering

Anyone with a missing daughter in 1937 should pay special attention.

To the Shanghai Shenbao Social Services Column:

You are probably surprised to receive this letter, right? This is because I am forced to come up with this idea out of desperation. I hope that you gentlemen will help me with the spirit of helping the poor and weak!

I am originally from Shanghai. In 1937, I was abducted by an evil person and sold to a brothel in Qingdao. It has been twelve years of suffering amidst their beatings and scoldings. In these twelve years, I have been thinking of my dear parents, brothers, and sisters every day. Unfortunately, under strict surveillance, I, a helpless, lonely, and weak woman, cannot fly out of this living hell even with wings. After much deliberation, I finally found a ray of light. I implore your newspaper to lend me a helping hand and help me find my parents, brothers, and sisters so that I can escape from the sea of suffering as soon as possible.

The following are my family situation and the details of my abduction:

I remember that my surname is Chen (I have forgotten my given name), and I am now nineteen years old. I was seven years old when I was abducted. My parents are still alive, and I have an older brother and two older sisters (my eldest sister was already married at that time). My father is a businessman. At that time, my brother and second sister were still in school. I remember that I also had a younger brother who was blind due to illness and died soon after. My home is located on a corner of Zhongzheng Middle Road, above a clock shop. One day, there was a wedding next door, and I secretly ran over to watch the excitement. A middle-aged man said to me: "How about I take you to your aunt's house to play?" I really had an aunt who was still running a lumber mill at that time, so I went with him. Little did I know that I had fallen into the trap of that evil person. I was taken to the countryside by him. A day later, he took me, a young woman, an old woman, and a girl who was a little older than me and had been abducted from somewhere, on a boat to Qingdao. He sold me to a brothel, and I lost contact with him! At this time and place, what could a lonely girl like me do? Please, gentlemen, show mercy and publish this. Perhaps my parents, brothers, and sisters are still living in Shanghai and will see this newspaper and save me from the sea of suffering!

——A suffering woman, currently named Wang Ying, tearfully pleads. Mailing address: Yin Guan, No. 10, Upstairs, No. 2 Mengyin Road, Qingdao.

### Two Kidnappers Arrested in Yixing, Hostage Ma Haorong Rescued

[Yixing Dispatch, April 19] Ma Haorong, a resident of Fucun Village, Heqiao Town, this county, owns more than a thousand acres of good farmland and lives a prosperous life. On the 11th of this month, four bandits, secretly armed with long and short guns, sneaked into Fucun Village and forced Ma Wencheng, the chief of the tenth Bao, to accompany them to Ma Haorong's house and kidnap him. When they left the gate, they covered his head with a long gown and carried him into a boat. The family soon received a letter from the kidnappers demanding a loan of 300 shi of military supplies to be delivered on the lake. The family reported this to Chief Liu of Zhongxi Township, who immediately ordered Zhou Hua, the leader of the standby squad, and a large number of officers to search along the Wudong Bridge and the banks of Gehu, on the border of Wuyi, for three days and nights. They arrested the two kidnappers, Wang Zhengpei and Jiang Wenqin, along with two hand grenades, in a suspicious boat, and rescued the hostage Ma Haorong.

### Since the Yangtze River Blockade, Zhenjiang's Shunjiangzhou is in a State of Suffocation

[Zhenjiang Dispatch, April 18] Shunjiangzhou, also known as Lotus Pond, in Zhenjiang, is located approximately fifteen kilometers downstream of Jiaodong, Zhenjiang. It is a small island in the Yangtze River, surrounded by water. On the island is only the small town of Gaoqiao. The island faces the Yangtze River to the south, opposite Dagang, and connects to the three districts of Jiangdu to the north. After the victory, it was renamed Gaoqiao District. The population is approximately 30,000, most of whom make a living by doing business, while those living in the countryside make a living by fishing for shrimp and crabs. The agricultural products of the entire district are only enough to sustain the people for three days. The only external transportation routes are the Zhenkou and Yaozhen lines. Recently, the river surface has been blocked, ships have been suspended, and transportation to Dagang has been cut off, leaving the entire island in a state of suffocation. Recently, a unit of the national army arrived, requiring each Bao to supply eight Dou of white rice, eight Jin of soybean oil, and three Jin of kerosene every day. The prices of rice, oil, salt, and other daily necessities have soared several times. People may starve to death. Now the citizens are appealing to the authorities to quickly open Dagang and restore transportation with Lotus Pond so that materials can circulate slightly and the burden on the people can be reduced slightly.

### Robbery Case by Vagrant Thieves in Zhenjiang: Two Criminals Apprehended, Stolen Goods Recovered

[Zhenjiang Dispatch, April 15] Another robbery case by vagrant thieves occurred here. On the evening of the 13th, four people in uniform went to the home of Zhang Xianfu, a merchant from Wuyang at No. 53 Xiaomenghu, and robbed two rings (weighing a total of five Qian, five Fen, and one Li), etc. Mr. and Mrs. Zhang resisted the search by the thieves, resulting in Mr. Zhang being shot in the head. The four criminals then fled. Mr. Zhang immediately reported the incident to the police station, which notified all the silver shops in the city to report to the bureau if they found rings of the same weight being exchanged. The next afternoon, two people in military uniforms went to Xintianbao Silver Shop, holding two rings of the same weight, to exchange them. The shop clerk pretended to be accommodating while secretly reporting to the nearby police station. Police officers were dispatched, and the two were arrested on the spot and sent to the criminal investigation team for interrogation. The two criminals, Yuan Changgui and Zhou Peng, both confessed to robbing Zhang Xianfu's home. However, they only stated that they were working with three people, and the other criminal, Ge Xingrong, has now fled to Wuxi. The stolen goods were recovered by the criminal investigation team and returned to Zhang Xianfu on the 14th.

### News in Brief

Zhenjiang [Our Dispatch] Since the retreat from the counties along the Yangtze River in northern Jiangsu, many officers and soldiers have returned one after another. In order to properly accommodate them, the Ministry of National Defense has set up reception stations in both Xiaguan, Nanjing, and Zhenjiang. The Zhenjiang station was established on the 21st. Also, as refugees from various counties in northern Jiangsu gather in Zhenjiang, the Executive Yuan has allocated 500,000 yuan to the provincial government to handle relief efforts.

Jiading [Our Dispatch] The ninth meeting of the county council was held from the 19th at the Ordinary School and closed at 5:00 PM on the 21st.

Wuxing [Our Dispatch] According to a secret report, the county government ordered the dissolution of the Zhonghua Morality Charity Association in this city and the Zhonghua Frugality Virtue Association in Nanxun on the 20th, as they are both disguised organizations of "Yiguan Dao," spreading heresy and bewitching the public.

### First Day of Market Trading Resumption: Gold Prices Plummet

The total amount of transactions for the day was not large, and the process was idle

[Our Dispatch] The Gold Trade Association of this city officially resumed collective trading at 10:00 AM yesterday. However, no ceremony was held. Industry leaders Xu Fusun and Zhao Zhongying, the acting chairman of the association, personally presided over the event. Representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the Gold Control Bureau, the Central Bank, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce attended to provide guidance. Liu Gongyun, Lin Chongyong, Li Daonan, Li Jiacai, Pan Hengqin, and others sent flower baskets to express their congratulations.

Yesterday, the association considered that it was the beginning of the resumption of the market. As of the opening of the market yesterday, only 39 telephone lines had been installed. However, 18 more were installed successively yesterday, so the market transaction throughout the day was quite idle. The bid prices fluctuated very little. It took a long time for each member to strike out and strike in one or two transactions. In total, about one hundred transactions (i.e., one thousand taels) were concluded in the morning, and only ten or so in the afternoon.

Yesterday, the gold market trend officially opened the market with the association. It was also heard that the National Bank had a sell-off near noon. The market trend changed from the flat trend in the morning to a full-scale decline in the afternoon. Compared with the opening price of 5,570,000 per tael in the morning and the closing price of 5,165,000 per tael in the afternoon, the price per major transaction fell by as much as 400,500 yuan in one day, which can also be said that the financial authorities have begun to exert their control over the official open market.

Yesterday morning, the gold market opened at 557, and then it was all in a flat market. It closed at 546 at 12:00. In the afternoon, it opened low at 517, with the lowest price seen at 516 in small transactions. Finally, it closed at 5165, and the process was lightly described.

In addition, yesterday, various firms inside and outside the industry believed that the fineness of the gold circulating in the market is mostly around 985. According to the association's trading rules, it has been rigidly stipulated that it must be above 985, otherwise it must be compensated according to the fineness and an additional 2 Qian for medicinal work. Many expressed dissatisfaction, so there were discussions about stopping trading together. However, according to the association, the association's drafting of the trading rules is based on the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, and it is not convenient to modify them accordingly. The current market may be inconvenient due to the sudden change of habits. However, following it for a long time will naturally correct the habit of insufficient fineness.

According to Mr. Liu Gongyun, after the Gold Industry Association resumed trading, the National Bank stopped allocating gold and sold it in the market instead. Currently, the market is only limited to the buying and selling of gold. The method of selling silver dollars is still to be studied in the next step.

### Trading Rules of the Gold Industry Association

### The Money Market Tightens First and Then Loosens

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday's money market was firm in the morning, and loosened again in the afternoon due to the authorities making a large difference and reporting a full-scale loosening. The daily interest rate opened at 80-90 yuan, but after 10:00 AM, all commodities reported declines. Those with long positions rushed to sell, and the daily interest rate fell to 70-80 yuan. In the afternoon, the national bank made a large difference, and the exchange position turned loose. The daily interest rate fell back to 60-70 yuan.

Yesterday, the national banks made a total difference of more than 3.87 billion yuan, the foreign banks made a difference of more than 720 million yuan, the large exchange banks made a difference of more than 1.95 billion yuan, and the small exchange banks made a difference of more than 2.64 billion yuan.

### Difficulties in Clearing Checks

[Our Dispatch] A few days ago (on the 21st), the check clearing house had difficulties in clearing because some banks and firms had difficulty in turning over their positions. The clearing was not completed until 8:00 PM, and it was not made up until yesterday morning.

The situation improved yesterday, but the exchange was not completed until after 6:00 PM.

The reasons are: (1) The money market suddenly tightened in the evening a few days ago, and the number of returned checks increased. (2) There is a shortage of cash. It is now heard that the Gold Control Bureau has paid attention to this matter and decided to thoroughly investigate the reasons for the delayed exchange and properly plan preventive measures for the future.

### Banks and Firms Increase Capital and Store Gold, Which Can Be Retrieved at the End of This Month

It was recently learned from the Financial Control Bureau that the stipulated period for the portion of the increased capital in cash transferred by banks and firms to the National Bank is three months. It will expire at the end of March of this year, and it can be retrieved. The bureau will notify each bank and firm to collect it upon maturity together with the Business Bureau of the National Bank. In addition, the bureau held the 21st audit meeting with the Audit Office of the Business Bureau of the National Bank yesterday and approved more than 30 applications for transferring and using cash for increased capital.

### The Chamber of Commerce Sent a Letter to the Central Bank to Level the Inland Exchange Rate

Reduce the cost of purchasing goods in the interior

[Our Dispatch] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Business Bureau of the Central Bank yesterday, requesting to level the inland exchange rate to facilitate the purchase of goods. The letter stated: "We are now informing the exporters that when Shanghai exporters purchase goods from the producing areas, the funds remitted should be at a premium due to the discount interest burden in order to achieve equilibrium. However, recently, the value of domestic currency has depreciated repeatedly. For example, for every 1,000 yuan of gold yuan notes sent from Shanghai to Wanxian, Sichuan, only 400 yuan can be received in Wanxian. If you take cash, there are only 300 yuan. The extent of the depreciation is appalling.

As for the price of goods in the producing areas, the rising trend exceeds that of Shanghai due to the increase in the cost of living. Under the double pressure of exporters, how can they proceed with procurement? Please order the banks to quickly handle the issue of leveling the exchange rate, etc. We have learned that the domestic remittance is usually regulated by your bank, and the exchange rate charged by commercial banks for remittance must not exceed a certain limit stipulated by your bank.

In view of the aforementioned situation, we request that you adjust the places with unusually high exchange rates, appropriately allocate funds to achieve the effect of leveling the exchange rate, so that Shanghai merchants can slightly reduce the cost of purchasing goods in the interior, and the national economy and people's livelihood will benefit. We hope that you will supervise and implement this and reply accordingly."

### The Money Market is Tight and People are Afraid: Chinese Stocks Fall into a Plague Situation

[Our Dispatch] The Chinese stock market situation was sluggish from the beginning yesterday, and then entered a plague-like state. The stock market sentiment was extremely bleak. Since the popularity of the high-interest-rate market, the rise in the stock market has been much worse than the general price level, which has led to a setback in the market and a loss of morale. The bulls feel very uninteresting.

In the morning, the tight money market overnight had an impact, and the secret interest rate rose sharply. The daily interest rate was as high as 85-95 yuan, and such a heavy interest threat was a major blow to the stock market. As a result, the bulls fell, the shorts raised their heads, and the selling pressure in the market suddenly increased, causing the market to plummet.

Yongsheng yarn opened in the morning with a low of 7.23 yuan. After the scattered shorts made up, it rose slightly to 7.33 yuan and 7.36 yuan. Hearing the news that the Central Bank was selling gold, people in the industry were broken and unbearable. Most of the major players were watching, and the situation was cold. The intermediate fluctuations were narrow, and it was in a low-level plague market all the way. Later, the external gold prices plummeted, and the money market in the market was tight. The scheduling was quite stagnant. The Jinye gang and the Banking gang were arranging funds and selling continuously, making the market even more unsustainable. It fell to 6.92 yuan and finally closed at 6.68 yuan at noon.

Small and medium-sized stocks opened flat in the morning. The support on the table was very strong in the middle, and once created a peak in the tired market, but the pull-up behind the scenes was very weak. At the noon close, they all fell back because the overall situation was soft. Xinyi, Tongyi, Jinglun, Qinxing, and underwear all opened flat and closed lower. Xinguang, Jingfu, and Meiya once strengthened after opening, but fell back at the noon close. The rest of the miscellaneous brands were sluggish. The total turnover of the city was 5.354 billion yuan, 545,000 shares.

### Foreign Stocks are Tired, Gold Bonds are Flat

The foreign stock market turned from rising to falling yesterday. The money market turned tight. The stock market sentiment was stronger. The market was weak at the noon close. Yisha was 15,200 yuan to 15,500 yuan, Yinglian was 23,000 yuan out, Yeguang was 5,500 yuan out, and Jardine Matheson was 60,000 yuan. All fell sharply.

The gold public debt was supported by the households yesterday, but the buying was not strong and the trading was quite deserted. It opened at 360,000 yuan in the morning, but there were no takers. The asking price fell slightly by 5,000 yuan. After falling to a low of 351,000 yuan, the selling pressure was still strong, and it continued to fall slightly to 351,000 yuan. Then it rose again to 355,000 yuan at the noon close. The after-market initially traded at 350,000 yuan, then fell slightly to 340,000 yuan. Finally, it closed at 250,000 yuan, with a turnover of 81 taels.

### Continued Shrinking of Hong Kong Exchange Rates

The Hong Kong exchange rate opened at 1,004.2 yuan per thousand this morning, and closed at 1,004.3 yuan per thousand last night. The Gold Yuan opened at 1,005 yuan per thousand this morning, and closed at 1,005.2 yuan per thousand last night. The Hong Kong gold price opened at 313.75 yuan per tael this morning, and closed at 312.5 yuan per tael last night.

The U.S. dollar telegraphic transfer opened at 5.26 yuan this morning, unchanged from the previous close. The U.S. dollar forward exchange opened at 5.24 yuan this morning, compared to the previous close of 5.22 yuan. U.S. dollar banknotes opened at 5.24 yuan this morning, and closed at 5.21 yuan last night.

U.S. Dollar Banknotes

The U.S. dollar banknote opened at 11,115 this morning, and closed at 10,300 yuan and 10,400 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it was 11,100 yuan and 11,200 yuan.

### A Stroll Through the Market: Observing Taiwanese Customers

The Market's Response Aims at an Even Narrower Target: High Interest Rates Still Favor Frequent Fluctuations

The general market is fully demonstrating a state of adaptation.

Yesterday, the gold market's opening trend was soft, giving the central bank ample face.

The stock market is still sluggish, which is a natural phenomenon during a period of adaptation. However, missing an opportunity yesterday may actually benefit those switching from stocks to gold; it's hard to say.

During this time of new political arrangements, everyone is being extra cautious. In the past, moments of uncertainty would always bring about excitement. Now, it's quite the opposite.

Going short or going long, there used to be a principle of "taking profits as soon as possible," fearing complications later on. Now, there's a tendency to prefer inaction over action, fearing the end of the night and the breaking of dreams. Truly, this is a different time.

However, the regular trends should not be forgotten. It's almost time to knock out goods a week in advance and release interest payments in preparation for month-end positions.

Being in a state of adaptation, gold, banknotes, silver dollars, rice, and coal – these five major targets – should be the focus of everyone's attention. The central bank is manipulating gold and banknotes. Silver dollars usually see more outflow than inflow, except during payroll periods. Therefore, the situation for the two major necessities of life, rice and coal, will become increasingly tense.

The soaring prices of rice and coal in recent days have already caused panic among citizens. However, when converted to gold prices, they are still lagging behind.

However, those who have been buying gold, banknotes, and silver dollars these past few days, when compared with releasing interest, are all losing money. For example, the closing gold price the day before yesterday was 547,500 yuan per tael. Based on the 0.55% daily interest rate on that day, the total principal and interest for yesterday should have been 577,600 yuan. However, the market price dropped to 518,500, effectively losing over 10% of the principal and interest.

### Rice Prices Continue to Soar: Special Japonica Rice Reaches a High of 68,000 Yuan; Flour Stops Rising and Falls; Cooking Oil Rises Again

Rice prices rose considerably yesterday. Because the previous day's increase was insufficient, sellers raised prices. In addition, Wuxi reported price increases, and the rain further solidified their sentiment. In the northern market, white japonica and thin indica rice both reached 65,000 yuan, up 7,000 yuan each. Special japonica rice reached a high of 68,000 yuan. In the southern market, the initial increase was 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, but due to tight credit in the central market, it retreated slightly by 1,000 yuan. Thin indica rice was at 63,000 yuan, up 5,000 yuan. However, the close was weak in many places. Total arrivals in the two markets amounted to 4,385 shi (石).

Cooking Oil

Rose again. Due to the rising rice prices and solid market sentiment, sellers immediately raised prices. However, due to tight credit, the close turned soft. Soybean oil opened at 250,000 yuan, with the highest being 256,000 yuan, closing at 254,000 yuan, up 10,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil also rose 10,000 yuan, closing at 239,000 yuan. Good barrel rapeseed oil was at 345,000 yuan, also up 10,000 yuan. Soybean cake trading was clear, with prices slightly higher.

Flour

Stopped rising and fell. In the early market, credit was relatively stable. Rice prices continued to rise, and various brands of flour once increased. Later, after hearing that the central bank was releasing a large number of gold bars, credit immediately tightened, and the market steadily declined. Lao Che (老車) flour last traded at 22,400 yuan. Bing Chuan (兵船) flour last traded at 21,380 yuan. Bran once reached a high of 18,000 yuan, but also saw a decline at the close. Large-package Fuxin flour was at 17,950 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

Closed early. In the early market, credit was still stable. Sesame was strongly absorbed by the Dasheng Oil Factory, with a sharp increase of over 20%. Yellow hemp and milk hemp all broke 100,000 yuan. Groundnut and soybeans were affected by tight credit in the later market, and the market rose first and then fell, still seeing a squeezed increase compared to yesterday. Corn and red sorghum sold quite smoothly, each up about 10%.

### The Loneliness of Green Serge

Due to sellers uniformly wanting to add interest, the woolen fabric market, although without any special large fluctuations, still saw all prices gradually rise towards a peak. Actual sales weakened accordingly. The trading of green serge was especially quiet. Sellers suddenly decreased, and factory production was temporarily suspended, sharply reduced to minimal levels. The price was far more reasonable than other colored woolen fabrics.

### Central Bank Seeks to Ease Restrictions on Cash Withdrawals

[Our Report] Yesterday, the central bank increased the amount of cash that banks could withdraw from 10% to 12%.

According to sources within the bank, this limit will be gradually increased depending on actual conditions, potentially reaching as high as 20% to 30%.

It is believed that the cash withdrawal limit, under current circumstances, can at least control the amount of deposits borrowed by banks and reduce the pressure on commodity prices. After the cash withdrawal limit, it will also help to tighten issuance. Yesterday, approximately 1 billion yuan of 500-yuan notes were issued, slightly less than in previous days.

### Southern Shipment Quotas for Yarn and Cloth
Statistics for Private Factories in March

[Our Report] It is reported that the March southern shipment quota for privately-owned factories under the Shanghai Cotton Textile Association is 4,600 bales of cotton yarn and 136,000 bolts of cotton cloth. As of the 15th of this month, 43 factories had applied for southern shipment of cotton yarn, with an original quota of 3,174 bales (2,901 bales applied for shipment by the 21st, and 273 bales had not yet applied for shipment). 21 factories requested to reserve a quota, totaling 1,040 bales, and 28 factories abandoned their quotas, totaling 386 bales.

63,292 bolts of cotton cloth had been applied for southern shipment, with 42,800 bolts still awaiting shipment application. Eight factories requested to reserve a quota, totaling 23,932 bolts, and three factories abandoned their quotas, totaling 5,234 bolts.

### Uniform Drop in Cotton Yarn; Cloth Market Nervous

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a slump as tight credit within the industry (daily interest rates above 80 yuan) dampened the enthusiasm of buyers. Sellers, however, were unwilling to release their goods due to cost considerations, causing trading within the market to become sluggish. All yarns closed with weak prices.

42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 3.8 million yuan, the closing price from the previous afternoon. After once rising to 3.85 million yuan, it fell to 3.73 million yuan, a decrease of 70,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix slightly fell by 10,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon opened at 2.58 million yuan, once rising to the closing price of the previous afternoon, but ultimately fell to 2.56 million yuan due to weak support, a drop of 70,000 yuan.

22-count Double Horse initially opened near the 2 million yuan mark. Then, upon hearing that goods outside the industry were weak and sentiment was poor, the price retreated to 1.87 million yuan. There was a slight rally before the close, recovering to 1.89 million yuan, a decrease of 50,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse fell from 1.85 million yuan to 1.8 million yuan, a drop of 60,000 yuan. In addition, Jincheng and Tiannu followed the downward trend.

The cloth market suddenly saw a downturn. Tightening credit, a uniform drop outside the industry, and the opening of shipments from the textile construction company all contributed to the nervous sentiment. Retailers, unable to bear the burden of high interest rates, rushed to sell. The selling pressure was intense near noon, and all cloths saw price decreases.

Dragon Head Fine Cloth rose from 85,000 yuan to a high of 88,500 yuan. As the close approached, the situation turned weak, and it ultimately closed low at 80,000 yuan, a decrease of 4,000 yuan. Trumpet Child and Friend B Dragon Head Fine Cloth each fell by about 3,000 yuan.

Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge initially opened at 76,000 yuan, once rising to 76,700 yuan before reversing course. The lowest price reached 72,600 yuan, and it ultimately closed at 73,000 yuan, a decrease of 2,800 yuan. Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance Yuan Serge slightly fell by 1,000 yuan. Private factories, due to cost considerations, uniformly increased prices for goods such as Shilin Cloth and Poplin. Among them, 190 high-end Shilin had already reached 170,000 yuan, but direct sales remained weak, with little actual trading.

### China Textile Sells Cloth

[Our Report] China Textile Construction Company sold cloth yesterday, as usual, selling a total of 14,610 bolts, and another 9,400 pounds of scrap cloth. 340 purchase orders were approved, with a value of 1,116,920,000 yuan.

The opening prices of the main cloths are as follows: Dragon Head 12-pound Fine Cloth 80,000 yuan, Large Other Special 12-pound Fine Cloth 55,000 yuan, Medium Other 50,000 yuan, Small Other 45,000 yuan, Flowers and Birds 81/201 City Cloth 86,000 yuan, Water Moon Nian Zhou Bleached Cloth 70,000 yuan, Leifeng Pagoda 40Y Fine Yuan Fine Cloth 65,000 yuan, Jumping Carp Fine Yuan Straight Tribute Satin 80,000 yuan.

### Four Mining Companies Joint Office Adjusts Coal Prices

[Our Report] The Four Mining Companies Joint Office adjusted coal prices yesterday. The new prices for each grade of fuel coal are as follows: Keelung coal 130,420 yuan per ton, Kailuan bituminous coal 147,230 yuan, foreign bituminous coal 312,930 yuan.

It is also understood that only 26,000 tons of Kailuan bituminous coal arrived this month, one-half the planned amount. It is said that the original plan was for two to four ships to regularly travel between North China and Shanghai, each capable of carrying approximately 8,000 tons of coal. Currently, only one ship is transporting, resulting in a large shortfall in coal deliveries compared to the planned target.

### Silk Softens

Yesterday's artificial silk market was weak. Credit was tight, gold prices outside the industry were severely depressed, and sentiment turned soft. Sellers were eager to release their goods for cash, and selling pressure was strong.

No. 120 bright new silk opened at 2.4 million, and immediately weakened, falling to 2.31 million before closing at 2.32 million at noon. In the afternoon, credit eased slightly, but sentiment remained weak. It initially opened at 2.3 million, then fell to 2.25 million.

Raw silk foreign exchange certificates saw a slight rise, but tight credit made it difficult for sellers to bear the burden, and they were still eager to release their goods. Superior grade Other Load opened at 3.6 million. Buying interest was stagnant after the opening, and selling interest increased on the trading floor. The market was watching and waiting, and it fell to 3.5 million near noon. The trend remained soft in the afternoon, with inconsistent prices. It was first quoted at 3.45 million, then 3.41 million.

Dacheng Silk Satin Bedding initially opened at a high of 1.7 million. After the opening, the overall trend softened, and the trading floor failed to provide support. Tightening credit further pushed the market down, reaching a low of 1.65 million. Short sellers covered their positions, and there was a slight rebound before the close, closing at 1,667,000 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it was quoted at 1.63 million yuan.

### Rainproof Cloth Sells Well

Rainproof cloth has been quite popular recently. Products from various factories, such as Yousheng, Shanghai, and Feilong brands, have been in high demand due to the increased sales opportunities created by the rainy weather. On the price front, prices have risen due to the high prices of raw yarn and the reorganization fees for the cost of living index. Yesterday, the transaction price per yard at the rainproof cloth tea party was 8,000 yuan for No. 1, 7,250 yuan for No. 2, and 6,600 yuan for No. 3.

### Tung Oil Trading Is Sluggish

Although the tung oil market was squeezed by tight credit and rising market interest rates yesterday, it followed the movements of foreign exchange transfer certificate market prices throughout the process, gradually advancing, with increases ranging from 5,000 to 30,000 yuan. However, transaction volumes remained scarce. This is because foreign market prices were weak, and domestic spring sales have not yet started, making it difficult to boost buying interest. Under these circumstances, it is likely that clarity will be difficult to achieve in the short term.

### Cigarettes Trend Downward; Soap and Matches Rise and Fall Sharply

The cigarette market continued to see a downward trend. Yesterday, Yongtaihe's announcement of shipping goods further tightened credit, and there were even fewer buyers. Trading was flat, and the market continued to weaken. White Tin Package 8,700 yuan, Three Cannons 6,700 yuan, Ten-pack Qianmen 6,250 yuan, Twenty-pack Qianmen 4,800 yuan, Ten-pack Great Britain 7,400 yuan, Twenty-pack Great Britain 3,060 yuan, Ten-pack Old Knife 2,200 yuan, Twenty-pack Old Knife 2,500 yuan, Beauty 4,600 yuan, Golden Mouse 2,250 yuan, Bank 3,330 yuan, Brandy 3,250 yuan, Red Gaole 3,250 yuan, 35 Brand 8,900 yuan.

The commodity market initially saw a sharp rise yesterday morning, then fell sharply. At the opening, major players sharply increased their purchases, and sellers uniformly raised prices. Later, upon hearing that gold and banknotes were weak, speculators closed out their positions. Additionally, tightening credit and major players selling back resulted in a sharp fall after the close. Solid Root reached a high of 86,000-87,000 yuan, then traded at 80,000 yuan. Beauty Matches initially traded at 350,000-360,000 yuan, then traded in the 330,000 yuan range.

### Shanghai Industrial Association Releases Overview of the City's Paper Box Industry

[Our Report] The Technical Committee of the Shanghai Industrial Association released an overview of the paper box industry yesterday as follows: Shanghai began to imitate paper box production after trade with foreign countries opened. However, at that time, there were no paperboard products, and only rough materials such as grass paper lined with San Ding Dalian paper were used to make the board. Only industries such as ginseng, bird's nest, Chinese medicine, and fragrant powder used boxes to hold items, and the usage was quite small. Around 1920, domestic paperboard factories such as Huacheng and Huafeng were established one after another, but production was not high. The first industries to extensively use boxes were Western medicine, followed by knitted underwear, shoes, and candy. Now, their use is becoming increasingly widespread, adopted by all industries.

The paper box production process initially involved using a horseshoe-shaped knife to manually cut the blank, score lines, and glue on thin paper to form the box. Recently, due to the increasing demand from industries such as rubber, cigarettes, and food, and the refinement of decoration, machines have gradually been adopted for manufacturing. The manufacturing process is briefly described below:

(1) Machine-made boxes: First, the paperboard is backed with white paper, then the trademark or brand address is printed. Then, the box blank is cut according to the printed lines. Finally, it is nailed with lead wire. However, only a small number of companies in the city, no more than ten or so, use machines with motor equipment.

(2) Handmade boxes: First, domestic yellow paperboard is used to line the inside, cut into square pieces according to the size of the box, and scored with fold lines. Then, the blank is assembled and covered with colored paper to form the outside layer. Handmade boxes are divided into various shapes such as square, round, and angular, as well as decorated with brocade, silk, and rosewood. The procedures are extremely complex, and the types are very numerous. Currently, there are approximately 300 companies in the industry. The reason why they have not yet switched to machines is due to the severe housing shortage since the victory of the war and the inability to increase the production of domestic paper materials. If machine paper materials can be produced in large quantities and widely promoted, the industry will have a hope for development in the future.

Paper boxes are mostly manufactured and consumed locally. Those sold abroad are only for export goods, as auxiliary decorative items.

The main raw materials are yellow paperboard, white paperboard, newspaper, kraft paper, and all kinds of colored paper. Before the war, the majority was supplied by foreign goods. In recent years, various domestic paper materials have gradually become more refined and are sufficient to replace them, but they are still not completely self-sufficient. Since this industry is a type of reprocessed product industry, it has not yet been able to directly purchase raw materials. Regardless of yellow paperboard or fine paper, it is entirely dependent on paper merchants. The price is high due to multiple rounds of buying and selling, and the cost is high, resulting in the complete elimination of the profit that should be earned. This is also a hidden pain and regret of the industry.

### Last Night's Basketball Game Was Extraordinarily Tense; Huili Fought Hard, Renyu Lost Color; An Intense Battle Between Enkas and McLings Decided by One Point in Overtime

[Our Report] Last night's basketball league program was extraordinarily tense. In the final game, the Huili team defeated the Renyu team 52-43, with the score at halftime being 19-17. Renyu started strong but weakened later. In the first half, the two sides were evenly matched, with only a two-point difference. However, in the second half, Cao Zhiji's consecutive scores for Huili undoubtedly dealt Renyu a blow. Due to the tension of the situation, their actions also became noticeably fiery, indirectly giving Huili a lot of free throw opportunities. As for the frequent adjustments, it also seemed to be a miscalculation. Huili was in exceptional form last night, with Cao, Wang, and Tian being particularly outstanding. For Renyu, Xu Zhongsi and Cai Jindian were relatively active.

In another game in Group A, Enkas and McLings tied at 35 at the end of regulation. In the five-minute overtime, Enkas won 44-42 by two points. In Group C, Meiqi Xiang defeated Pei'er 39-35.

Let's first talk about the headline battle between Huili and Renyu, which didn't start until 8 p.m. The Huili starting five were Cao Zhiji, Wei Xu, Ye Zhenshan, Wang Yongfang, and Tian Fuliu. Renyu responded with Sun Guozheng, Xu Zhongsi, Li Zhaohe, Wang Huaixing, and Shen Pengju. In the opening jump ball, Renyu immediately took the offensive. Yongfang committed a foul, and Zhaohe made the first free throw. Huili players Fuhai and Zhiji had bad luck. Guozheng and Yunshan each scored, and Zhongsi also jumped up and scored. Yongfang made two free throws, and Renyu was still in the lead 5-4. Then, both sides committed fouls, Zhongsi made it, Fuhai missed, and Shen Pengju added two more points. Huili called a timeout at 8-4. Renyu substituted Ye Jindian for Huaixing. Three minutes of back-and-forth fighting yielded nothing, and Renyu also called a timeout. Huili's luck turned around. Fuhai and Yongfang scored on two free throws, tying the score at 8. Pengju scored one point to take the lead, and Jindian rushed forward, putting the ball into the basket. Huili made a long pass, and Fuhai unexpectedly broke out on his own, and Yongfang made a highlight play. Huili took the lead 12-11. After Guozheng tied the score, Huaixing replaced him, and Wu Xinyun replaced Jindian. It soon became tied at 14. Cai Wu restored the original situation, Yunshan and Fuhai made free throws, and Yongfang also shot. At halftime, Huili was ahead 19-17.

The game was quite attractive, drawing about 3,000 fans. The second half continued. Zhiji showed his prowess at the start. Renyu's Jindian retaliated with a basket, but Lao Cao returned. The score was 25-20. Yao Wenyi replaced Zhongsi with silk. Cao continued to throw and free throw, and his momentum increased. The score was 28-22. Xinyun replaced Huaixing. Huili had many free throw opportunities. Renyu was busy adjusting its players. Soon, the score was 38-22. Renyu was behind by 16 points, and it looked bleak. Afterwards, although Jindian and Zhongsi tried their best to fight hard, it was all in vain. Finally, Huili replaced Wang Yongfang with Chen Zhengmiao, and ultimately won 52-43.

Mei-Pei Game

In the Group C game between Pei'er and the American Meteorological Team, Pei'er was disorganized before the game and was late to the court. After the game started, they initially led, but soon saw several tall players from the Meteorological Team moving freely under the basket. The Meteorological Team trailed 21-15 in the first half.

In the second half, Hu Jiazhang of Pei'er scored several consecutive baskets, bringing the score to 23-22, within half a point. It was quite impressive. At ten minutes, the score was tied at 27. Pei'er then added a free throw, and the situation changed. After a period of scrambling, the Meteorological Team regained the lead, and ultimately won 39-35. Pei'er lost.

In an energetic performance by both teams, McLings's Gao Folai and another player were unusually well-matched, and the score steadily increased, even exceeding Enkas at one point. At halftime, Enkas was ahead 19-17.

After the break, McLings scored four consecutive points, and dozens of teammates in the stands shouted and cheered. But the situation often changed, going up and down unpredictably. When McLings led 27-22, Enkas saw that the situation was unfavorable, and Kai Jie Miluofu personally took the field, bringing in the fat boy Qiu. The game remained tense. En team's Ao Chailiao and Que Li were determined to fight hard. In the last two minutes, the score was tied at 35. In the five-minute overtime, a final victory had to be decided. Que Li threw in the first ball from the crowd. Both sides committed fouls. En made it, and McL missed. Then, McLings's Gao Folai and the opponent's Que Li each scored a basket. Liss made a free throw, and En team's Bo Tou Gai made a free throw. McLings's Lai Mu Shan made a shot, but missed a free throw, still one point short. In the last minute, Bo Tou added three points, and Gao Folai also made it, but was still two points short. Enkas ultimately won 44-42.

### Women's Basketball Technique

— Translated by Qi Yi

When learning to use a shifting zone defense, the defender must absolutely stand within strategically important areas, specifically within the mid-range shooting distance of the attacker. This is 100% correct, and even advanced players using this method should adhere to this principle. Only leave the defensive zone to intercept the opponent's pass when you are confident you have a foolproof opportunity. Remember, practice makes perfect. Once you've practiced enough to use it smoothly, players will know when intercepting an attacker's pass will be effective.

Beginner basketball players should be warned against indiscriminately leaving the area they are defending to intercept an attacker's pass. This can easily lead to personal fouls or inaccurate footwork, causing them to run past the ball. A disorganized defensive position gives the attacker a great advantage.

The previous section explained that defenders should not lightly leave the area they are defending, but it should not be taken as an absolute rule. Remember, defending is about pure defense, and defenders should not take risky gambles.

Defenders attempting to intercept passes across the center line are most prone to fouls and footwork errors. To counter passes over the center line, use a different defensive approach. Defenders must be agile and have a sense of anticipation, taking defensive positions before the opposing guard even passes the ball over the center line. Below are two formations for defending against passes over the center line.

(1) (See Diagram 11) This type of defense requires coordination between the guard and the forward to be effective. When the opposing guard gains possession, the three attackers on the offensive side should immediately stand side-by-side in a line near the center line, leaving no gaps. The left and right guards move forward to the center line, filling in the gaps, while the center guard retreats to the edge of the key to guard against attackers receiving the ball and breaking through. This is essentially setting up a zone defense in the mid-court. The opposing guard cannot use short passes to cross the center line; a long pass is the only option, but long passes are easily intercepted.

Attackers should watch the ball-handling guard as they prepare to make a short pass near the free-throw line. They should then rush forward to intercept the pass, with the two guards covering them. This pressure on the guard may cause them to panic and fail to pass the ball, or they may be forced into a jump ball or have the ball intercepted. (To be continued - VII)

### Women's Basketball Circle

— Mei Jie

Based on the current women's league standings, I should talk about the 'Li Team.'

The predecessor of the Li Team was the Frontline Team, and the Frontline Team was a mixed team of the Women's Youth Purple and the Youth League. When the Frontline Team disbanded, the Youth League players went to the Star China Team, and the Women's Youth Purple players became the Li Team. So, the current Li Team is equivalent to the former Women's Youth Purple, minus Zhu Jin Yun. Therefore, judging by the history and experience of the Women's Youth Purple, their current record can be considered quite an achievement. By 'quite an achievement' I mean second only to the Green Team in this league, even surpassing the Star China Team, which has four city representatives. Isn't that a good achievement?

The team is constantly working hard to improve its methods. During the Women's Youth Purple era, they were coached by Wu Shi Jian, and during the Frontline Team era, Cai Tong Ke took over. Indeed, the coaches taught diligently, and the players learned attentively. They tried their best to use the methods during matches. Naturally, they were clumsy at first, but gradually became more skilled, and their performance improved accordingly. Furthermore, I recently discovered a characteristic of the Li Team players: they watch a lot of games. It can be said that they always come to the gymnasium when there is a match. We should realize that it is very beneficial for players to watch more games. They can learn from the strengths of others and use them as their own blueprint. Watching more games can also increase their experience in battle. Therefore, the Li Team has recently been watching games constantly and has already benefited from it to some extent.

In terms of using methods, the Li Team may be more serious than the Green Team. However, their lineup has a clear weakness: they are too short and seem to lack strength. Therefore, they lack a rushing and decisive power, which makes it difficult to fully display their abilities. For example, the Qian Chu Ping and Qian You Ping sisters can shoot baskets and have good evasive skills, but they are so petite and weak that they are easily marked by their opponents. There is also the forward Yao Si Lian, who is better than her sister Yao Si Yuan, who belongs to the Star China Team. Her mid-range shooting, in particular, can be said to be up to standard, but she also lacks strength and high speed, so she cannot display the qualities of an ideal forward. Here, I recall that the team used to have a good forward named Zeng Zhao Qing, who was indeed an ideal candidate. She studied at Qi Xiu School, but the school doctor said she had an illness and could not exercise, so she had to stop playing basketball. This was indeed a loss for the Li Team. (Note: Zeng Zhao Qing has now returned to her hometown of Xiamen).

Here, I have discovered further evidence that a women's basketball forward must have the talent for short-distance running to have the high-speed burst needed to threaten opponents. For example, the Green Team's Huang Ming Yuan, Shi Zong Lan, and Zhu Jin Yun are considered the three best female sprinters in Shanghai. Therefore, when the three of them play as forwards, they can use their speed like butterflies flitting through flowers, and they put on excellent performances. In contrast, the Li Team's three young players do not have this ability. Therefore, although they have good shooting skills and know how to strategize, they have not achieved the results they hoped for. I hope they can work hard to improve in this area.

As for the Li Team's defensive strength, Chen Wen Yan is quite impressive, but the other two are relatively inexperienced, so their performance in battle is hurried and not as good as expected. This is a process that players must go through. After a period of time, they will definitely be able to enter the hall of fame, without a doubt.

Overall, the Li Team has already defeated Star China, so there is naturally high hope that they will take second place in this competition, or at least tie with the Star China Team for second place. Comparing everything about them with Star China, they can live up to their hard work. Naturally, we hope they can go one step further. What I mean is that they must improve in terms of physical strength and gain experience. Then, a bright future is to be expected. I hope the young players of the Li Team will strive for it!

Li Team lineup: From right to left (back row): Xu Mu Ben, Chen Yu Qin, Chen Wen Yan, Cai Ming Xia, Quan Li Li, Xu Hui Ru, (front row): Niu Yun Juan, Yao Si Lian, Qian Chu Ping, Qian You Ping, Zhu Cui Di, Li Yao Ying.

### Women's Sports Issues

— Yan Xiu Rong

(1) The Current State of Women's Sports

Since the introduction of European and American culture to China, sports have gradually been recognized as an important field. In China, women's sports have been promoted for more than 30 years and appear to be thriving on the surface. Looking at the women's track and field records, ball skills, and participation rates in recent years, it seems that women's sports have been widely promoted. However, with closer observation and understanding, it is easy to discover the problems: either excessive obsession with competitive sports or neglect and disregard. The general public's view of women's sports can be roughly divided into two categories: 1. The Obstinate Faction – They still hold feudal ideas, believing that women should still be delicate to be considered beautiful, a morbid concept of beauty. Women should not engage in the same activities as men. In schools, generally stubborn and conservative administrators often do not know what sports are. Not only do schools lack general sports facilities, but the selection of physical education teachers and the implementation of sports courses are also perfunctory and superficial. Sports are neglected and disregarded. 2. The Radical Faction – Overly obsessed with competitive sports, leading to abnormal development. Many institutions, schools, or individuals spare no expense to support a few athletes as tools for publicity. Some even value sports for the sake of winning championships, harming the health of women's sports.

All of this leads to abnormal development in sports, with a lack of exercise or championship-oriented sports, completely deviating from the meaning of sports. In the current era, the training and development of body and mind through sports has been generally recognized. The obstinate faction that opposes women's sports should be eliminated by the times, but championship-oriented sports should also be strictly corrected. The meaning of sports competitions is originally only to promote and encourage skills, stimulate interest, and observe techniques. If it harms the normal development of the body, it completely violates the true meaning of sports. Normal sports should provide widespread training based on women's physical and mental health, their athletic ability, and their mental training, strengthening physical fitness and promoting a courageous and lively spirit. It must help create the talent needed by the times and train the women needed by modern society, so that sports do not lose their meaning in education.

(2) Physiological Issues of Women's Sports

Women are the mothers of future generations, and their physical strength is the foundation for the health of future children. Therefore, to transform the physique of the entire nation, the physical training of women, who bear the responsibility of reproduction, is extremely important. However, women's physique differs physiologically from men's. Their body, respiratory organs, and blood circulation differ significantly from men's. Anatomically, the differences between the sexes are roughly three points: (1) After adolescence, women's pelvises obviously widen, causing femoral obliquity. In all lower limb movements, their pelvises tend to sway from side to side. The greater the sway, the greater the resistance to forward speed. The main reason women's running ability is inferior to men's is this. (2) Due to the need for reproduction, women's bodies are proportionally longer, with a larger height coefficient than men's. In addition, the pelvis is enlarged, resulting in a lower center of gravity. (3) Women have less muscle and more fat than men. Therefore, although women's physical strength is not as good as men's, their hidden potential is often greater than men's. Based on the above reasons, due to the physiological differences between the sexes, their sports standards should also be differentiated to suit women's health.

(3) Women and Sports

(1) Women and General Strength Exercises – The importance of total muscle mass, according to Europeans, is on average 24.5 grams for men and 14.75 grams for women. The ratio to total body weight is 10 for men and 9 for women. However, the ratio of muscle weight is 10 for men and only 6 for women. Furthermore, women's lives, whether in the home or serving society, generally do not require large muscles. Given their gentle nature, women are not well-suited to general strength exercises such as wrestling, boxing, or weightlifting.

(2) Agile Exercises – Women's upper limbs are shorter relative to their trunks than men's. Because women's center of gravity is lower than men's, agile exercises such as hanging, climbing, handstands, and rotations are generally unnecessary for women.

(3) Dance – Women have greater body stability than men. Therefore, they are best suited for activities that require a lot of dance, especially in terms of providing vitality and enjoyment.

(4) Gymnastics – Swedish and Danish gymnastics, with movements that are not too intense and are rhythmic, are suitable exercises for women. However, jumping and hanging movements should be reduced in intensity compared to men.

(5) Swimming – According to most physical education experts, swimming is indeed the most suitable exercise for women. Swimming movements are even and not too strenuous. Women's bodies float easily in the water and are more tolerant of the cold. In addition, women generally like swimming.

(6) Ball Sports – Indoor baseball is extremely popular, with smaller hitting and throwing forces, and can be considered an appropriate exercise. Tennis movements are graceful and suited to women's preferences. Volleyball is suitable for women. Table tennis, if practiced moderately, is also a suitable exercise.

(7) Track and Field – All track and field exercises, if practiced carefully and cautiously, can be of great benefit to women's bodies and minds. However, long-distance running is not suitable in terms of physical strength.

(8) Other Various Exercises – (A) Cycling – Can be considered a suitable exercise if done without overexertion. (B) Rowing – If done competitively, it requires great physical strength and is not very suitable. However, free rowing can develop the chest and upper limbs and is a suitable physical exercise. (C) Mountain climbing and hiking – Can be considered extremely suitable exercises for women. These exercises do not require momentary great physical strength and are very interesting. In addition, sports such as ice skating and skiing are also suitable for women.

(4) Future Trends in Women's Sports

In the future, women's sports must not aim to achieve its purpose by training in a few skills. Its training core should be expanded to the entire life. Based on the principles of physical and mental health, universal, collective, and rigorous training should be implemented to wash away the delicate, lazy, and slow movements of the past, and move towards a healthy, agile, brave, hardworking, and determined path with a spirit of striving for independence.

### Salary Devaluation "Branch" Notes

— Chu Dong

From the ringing of the telephone to the news in the newspaper, it was confirmed that civil servants' salaries for March would be paid on the 15th.

There was an immediate commotion in the office, and everyone seemed a little uneasy. The 15th! Isn't that tomorrow?

The topic of conversation among colleagues was all about this. Even the usually taciturn section chief couldn't help but join in the conversation from time to time.

Old Shen was calculating the use of this income, because his home was still on the other side of the river, and now communication and news had long been cut off. So, he lived alone in the public dormitory, and could only buy a little bit of small-sized materials to store. The last time the water and electricity bill was paid, prices had already risen very high. He thought it would stop eventually, so he didn't buy anything. As a result, he took a big discount and spent it all piecemeal. He wanted to make a decision this time. As soon as he got the money, he would go to buy something. But he wanted to buy something that would be easier to buy and sell, and not too big. He decided to buy a few Yuan silver dollars.

Although the cost of living index for civil servants has reached more than 1,000 times, civil service salaries are only 225 times higher. He couldn't help but feel a little injustice and complained in his heart. But this time, it was twice as much as last month. Moreover, after the index is released at the end of the month, he can get a one-time supplement. Last month, he got 7,500 yuan. This time, three fives are fifteen, three sevens are twenty-one, so he can get 22,500 yuan. Deducting 5,000 yuan for half a month's food and 1,000 yuan for donations, he can net more than 16,000 yuan. At the current market price, he can buy four silver dollars. He decided to go buy them as soon as he got the money.

The next day, in the office, the colleagues' topic of conversation was still about "waist water." Two who had families in Shanghai were even more anxious than ants on a hot pot. However, the morning passed peacefully after all, but there was no news. In the afternoon, the guard at the gate was released, waiting for the jeep to arrive from the bank to collect the money, so they could get the money first. But they waited until the end of office hours in the afternoon, and there was still no news. Some colleagues who were more well-informed said: The money market is tight today, and they are afraid that they won't be able to get cash. At the same time, news of rising prices kept coming. Rice broke the 40,000 mark, and the silver dollars were close to 5,000.

The 16th and 17th days passed in tension, anticipation, and anxiety. The price of rice was 45,000, and then it exceeded 50,000. The silver dollars rose from more than 5,000 to 6,400 yuan. However, the people who went to the bank to collect the money said that they had only received copper plates and could not exchange them for cash. A colleague waited impatiently and went to the bank in person to see what was going on. He came back and reported that the bank staff were also in a hurry and had no way to deal with it. They bowed and apologized to the people from various institutions who came to collect the money and said: We really can't get so much cash today. Even if you kill us, it will be useless. We will definitely find a way to pay tomorrow. However, the people who came to collect the money were still unwilling to leave. After a while, they agreed to issue 30% in cash and 70% in drafts. However, everyone knew that drafts needed to be discounted if they were used on the market, so they didn't agree.

In the office, everyone had not dispersed by 5:00 pm. This was unprecedented. Disappointment, resentment, curses, and even some barbaric laughter and scolding, and intense proposals filled the small room. Just as they were feeling helpless, good news finally arrived: the cash had been collected, but it was too late. Come early tomorrow. Then everyone deflated like a balloon and dispersed like birds and beasts.

The net saving of 16,000 yuan was finally obtained the next day. They were neat stacks of new purple banknotes, and they made a "hissing" sound when counted. There were thirty-two in total.

After leaving a small amount for pocket money, he bought two silver dollars - half of what he had budgeted.

In the early morning, everyone read the "Salary Devaluation Notes" in the Free Talk, and couldn't help but smile knowingly. So, on a whim, he picked up a pen and wrote this "Branch" note.

### Birds Also Know Medicine

— Xiao Kang Shi

I read Bai Xiangshan's poem: "Deer chew bean sprouts to detoxify aconite, magpies carry artemisia leaves to seize swallow nests. Birds and beasts have never seen the herbal, who taught them to know the medicinal properties?"

According to the hunters, the arrows they use often use aconite poison. If a deer is hit by an arrow, it will often find bean sprouts to chew on to detoxify itself.

When magpies want to seize swallow nests, they often first carry a sprig of artemisia leaves and place it on top of the nest. The swallows are afraid and avoid it, and the magpies occupy the nest. This is because swallows hate artemisia leaves.

Shennong tasted hundreds of herbs and learned their medicinal properties, but birds and beasts are also able to know them, using bean sprouts to detoxify arrow poison and artemisia leaves as weapons. Their cleverness is no less than that of humans, which is indeed amazing.

### Gold Yuan and Tin Foil

— Xu Zhuo Zhi

Because Qingming Festival is approaching, I went to buy a thousand sheets of tin foil yesterday for use at the tomb. Chinese people have always valued their ancestors in the underworld more than the living. Although I don't really believe in this, I went to buy them because my wife urged me to. I asked, and a thousand sheets of tin foil actually cost 5,400 Gold Yuan, averaging more than five yuan per sheet.

At this point, I couldn't help but feel emotional. The Gold Yuan is already so worthless that it can't even be used in the underworld. Holding this thick stack of banknotes that was exchanged for such a thin piece of tin foil, I suddenly thought on the way home that the Central Bank is trying its best to overcome its timidity. Why doesn't it use its brains on this?

With Qingming Festival approaching, the amount of tin foil burned in Shanghai, and even across the country, must be considerable. If the Central Bank could come up with a way to make the common people (especially the old women) believe that our Gold Yuan can also be used in the underworld and has not depreciated at all, with every four yuan still able to be exchanged for one US dollar, and every two hundred yuan able to be exchanged for one small yellow croaker, then people would naturally no longer be willing to spend more than 5,000 Gold Yuan to buy a thousand sheets of tin foil, but instead directly burn the banknotes to their loved ones in the underworld. In this way, the Central Bank can invisibly recover (because others burned it for you) a large amount of currency, without having to release gold or silver dollars at all. Wouldn't that be killing two birds with one stone?

I think this is not difficult to do. The Central Bank can immediately set up a propaganda office in addition to its current departments. In terms of personnel, it should first contact witch doctors and monks and Taoists across the country to actively promote that the underworld has adopted the Gold Yuan as the only legal currency in March of this year for a unified monetary system. All other tin foil, ingots, paper silver dollars, etc., are no longer used. If you want to burn some money to your ancestors or relatives in the underworld, the only way is to burn some Gold Yuan to them. It should also be declared that because Bao Longtu is the Yama in the underworld, he is always ready to use the guillotine to kill people, so the speculation and hoarding trend has disappeared, and the value of the Gold Yuan is extremely high. Burning four or five thousand like this can already be of great use.

If this propaganda is effective and becomes popular among the old women who believe in Buddha and ghosts, and everyone does it, just imagine: the country can save a batch of useful materials - tin, and the currency will be issued and burned from time to time, and will never inflate because there is too much. How obvious the benefits are.

The Central Bank can also stop selling materials to tighten the money supply, because naturally, the money supply can be "burned" very tight.

### Strange Customs

— Cang Yu

In a certain area of Peru, there is a peculiar custom that if a woman's skirt is torn, she is not allowed to take it off, but can only add a new one on top of it. Thus, for each torn skirt, a new one is added. Women from wealthy families often wear more than a dozen skirts. Furthermore, whenever these women meet a man, the men must take off their hats to show respect.

Among the Mosuo people, if a wife cannot give birth to a male child after marriage, she must obtain special permission from the clan chief to divorce her husband and marry another man. She can continue to divorce and remarry until she can give birth to a male child. Only then can she officially be called the permanent wife of her last husband.

Thai people often change the color of their pants and aprons according to the day of the week. Red on Sunday, yellow on Monday, pink on Tuesday, green on Wednesday, light gray on Thursday, feather gray on Friday, and purple on Saturday. They believe that the stars in the sky have seven colors, and the stars in the human world also have seven colors. Therefore, the sun and moon match the colors of the stars in the sky to seek more blessings. White is worn for funerals, just like in our country.

### Writer

— Translated by Cang Yu

A writer is able to win our love and care because he reveals his soul to us. — Tolstoy

A writer should be as unfettered by worldly affairs as a clergyman. — Emerson There are two types of writers: one who writes for the sake of writing, and another who writes for the sake of a topic. — Balzac

The world often praises writers of previous generations, not because writers are admired after death, but because writers compete and fight fiercely when they are alive, and no one is willing to praise anyone. — Tagore

If a writer only thinks about the problems of life when writing, it is difficult for him to have lofty ideas. — Romain Rolland

A writer's pen is the throat of the soul. — Kingsley

My writing is not on the surface, but in the soul: only a lofty soul can have great thoughts. ... A great and respectable writer does not use words as a means to seek fame and fortune. Those who only seek to make money naturally have base thoughts. — Johnson

A great writer must write about the suffering of the times and create the light of the times. — Lu Xun

### Paris Also Experiences Housing Shortages

— Dongfang Jing

It was once said that Shanghai was the Paris of the East. Judging from the housing shortages in both places, they are indeed quite similar.

In Paris, a worker pays only one U.S. dollar per month for rent. A house suitable for a family of six costs two dollars per month (equivalent to the price of eleven packs of the cheapest cigarettes). A medium-sized apartment with three or four large rooms costs one and a half to two and a half U.S. dollars per month. Even the houses inhabited by the wealthy cost only three and a half to ten U.S. dollars per month.

Low rent is certainly good news for tenants, but the housing shortage in Paris is becoming increasingly serious, with occupancy rates at capacity everywhere. Almost no new houses have been built in Paris in the past twelve years.

The only opportunity to find housing is to wait for a lonely old tenant to die, and then move in immediately. Renting an apartment requires a down payment of five hundred to fifteen hundred U.S. dollars.

Paris has approximately eighty-four thousand various types of residences, of which over ninety percent were built before World War I. At least sixteen thousand of these are dilapidated and should be demolished and rebuilt. However, the remaining houses are not all up to standard either. Eighty-two percent of Paris houses do not have bathrooms, more than half do not have sanitary facilities, and even one-fifth of the houses do not have running water.

### The Story of the Safety Razor

— Bin Zhi

There's a saying: "Frequent haircuts, infrequent baths." But most people feel the opposite: bathing is relaxing and enjoyable, while getting a haircut is often seen as a daunting task, and people try to postpone it for as long as possible. Longer hair isn't necessarily a problem, but a face full of stubble feels a bit unpresentable in public. While one may have a razor for shaving at home, the blade is sharp, and without the skilled hands of a barber, a careless move can lead to bloodshed. In this situation, the safety razor was eventually born.

The safety razor was invented in 1880 by three German brothers who immigrated to the United States. The form of the razor resembled a hoe, with a blade open on one side, called the "Star Razor." Within a few years of its appearance, it became popular and took away business from many barbershops. Soon, the "Gem" and "American" razors also emerged, creating a three-way rivalry.

At that time, although the safety razor was quite popular, it was not yet universal. Sales surged after the Gillette razor was introduced in 1903. Packets of blades, like packets of chewing gum, became household items. The creator of the Gillette razor was the person pictured on the wrapper, "Gillette." He was originally a salesman from Brooklyn with ambitions to invent. He spent his days searching for things needed in everyday life, noting them down on small pieces of paper and arranging them alphabetically. The fantasy of invention consumed him day and night.

One morning, Gillette was washing up, standing in front of the mirror, shaving his face. The razor had lost its sharp edge, and it hurt him to shave. Suddenly, he had an inspiration: he thought of making blades from thin steel sheets, sharp on both sides, and attaching them to a frame, which would be very convenient to use. So he immediately went to a hardware store to buy a steel strip used for making clock springs, and used pliers and other simple tools to make a sample blade. Everyone laughed at him, and many people in knife and scissor factories advised him to give up the idea.

But Gillette did not heed their advice. He believed that steel sheets could be made into blades, as long as the technology was improved. He continued to research while trying to raise capital. Six years later, he found twenty people who were willing to gamble, each contributing two hundred and fifty U.S. dollars. These two hundred and fifty U.S. dollar shares were worth sixty-two thousand five hundred U.S. dollars a few years later.

With this five thousand U.S. dollars in capital, Gillette bought machines and started manufacturing his new product in a room above a fish shop. By 1903, the blades were successfully produced, but the company was in debt, and the workers had not been paid for two weeks. At that time, Gillette found another boss who was willing to invest sixty thousand dollars but required full management control of the factory. Gillette reluctantly accepted. In 1903, fifty safety razors were sold at five dollars each. By the second year, sales had exceeded ninety thousand. In the third year, sales increased to more than two hundred and seventy thousand.

After the success of Gillette blades, sales increased year by year. In 1905, a London office was established. The following year, sales spread throughout Europe. In 1915, the "Old Man" brand blades were launched, using various methods to try to replace Gillette blades. Today, "Old Man" blades are also very popular, but Gillette blades have not been greatly affected.

The popularity of Gillette blades is partly due to his patent. Because Gillette obtained a seventeen-year patent after making double-edged blades, other manufacturers could only make single-edged blades. Without anyone competing with him, he was able to have smooth sailing. By 1921, the Gillette blade patent had expired, and other brands of double-edged blades emerged like a storm. At that time, many kinds of Japanese blades were shipped to Chicago. The Gillette company also knew this, and in that year, they made a new, more beautiful style, selling it at a lower price than before. In this way, the new brands could not gain a foothold, and Gillette made even more money.
