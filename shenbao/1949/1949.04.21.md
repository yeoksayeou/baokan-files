### Government Refuses CCP Demands, Still Hoping for Ceasefire Before Peace Talks; Reply Delivered by Delegation in Peiping; Wu Tiecheng, Huang Shaohong Fly to Guangzhou, Zhang Qun to Xikou for Report

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The government has decided to reject the CCP's eight articles and twenty-four clauses of the proposed peace agreement. The reply telegram was transmitted from Nanjing to the government's peace talk delegation in Peiping on the afternoon of the 20th. It will be delivered to the CCP delegation by Zhang Zhizhong that evening. The success or failure of the current peace talks will depend on the CCP's reaction to this reply. The government's reply is a comprehensive response to the CCP's twenty-four clauses, rather than a point-by-point rebuttal. The main points of the telegram state: (1) The fundamental spirit of the CCP's clauses is unequal and unreasonable, not in the spirit of peace talks, and is unacceptable to the government. (2) It is hoped that the CCP will reconsider its attitude based on the interests of the people, cease fire first, and then continue peace talks. The full text is very long. The first paragraph describes the government's efforts to compromise, endure humiliation, and seek peace, and explains the deep suffering the people have experienced since the eight-year war of resistance, and their eagerness for the arrival of peace. President Chiang's retirement is also a manifestation of sincere peace seeking. It then states: The draft proposed by the CCP is an attitude towards the conquered, especially the designated signing on the 20th, which is tantamount to an ultimatum. The various clauses are like a verdict against the government, which the government cannot implement. The consequences are unimaginable and will inevitably lead to a greater war, and the nation will suffer a tragic fate. The so-called reorganization of the army is actually the elimination of the national army. If implemented, it will arouse the indignation of the military and civilians, and the country's wealth and people's property will suffer a catastrophe. The united government will have people appointed by the CCP, which is tantamount to the government surrendering and disarming. The government is willing to compromise, but the military and civilians across the country cannot accept it, so it is hoped that the CCP will reconsider and change its attitude. The telegram also pointed out that the widespread attacks by the communist army in Jiangbei in recent days are hindering the peace talks, and it is hoped that both sides can sign a ceasefire agreement first and then continue the peace talks.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The government spokesman issued the following statement late on the 20th regarding the government's response to the CCP: "The government has formally responded to the CCP's proposed clauses on the afternoon of the 20th, hoping that the CCP will consider the content of our response in a spirit of equality, and hope that a temporary ceasefire agreement can be established first, and then long-term discussions can be held." The spokesman said: The government's reply telegram was signed jointly by Acting President Li and President of the Executive Yuan He Yingqin, and was sent by telegram to Zhang Zhizhong on the afternoon of the 20th to be forwarded to the CCP.

### Standing Committee Passes Statement

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 20th] Wu Tiecheng, Huang Shaohong, and others arrived in Guangzhou by plane from Nanjing at 7:20 p.m. on the 20th. That night at 9 p.m., the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee convened an interim meeting. Wu and others reported on the process of the peace talks, the CCP's plan, and the content of the government's reply. A statement on the CCP's "plan" was then passed, and the meeting adjourned at midnight. (The full text of the statement, more than a thousand words, will be published tomorrow.)

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The Peace Talk Guidance Committee met at 9 a.m. on the 20th to continue detailed discussions on the CCP's eight articles and twenty-four clauses. By 12 p.m., a resolution had been reached, which was immediately telegraphed to the government's peace talk delegation in Peiping to be forwarded to the CCP authorities. Wu Tiecheng and Huang Shaohong took a special Tzu Chiang plane to Guangzhou around 2 p.m. to report to the Central Standing Committee. When reporters asked for his opinion at the airport, Mr. Wu only said, "Seek our own unity to reverse the overall situation." Huang, on the other hand, has decided to resign from his position as a government peace talk representative and plans to fly to Hong Kong on the 21st for recuperation, and will not be involved in politics. Zhang Qun and Wu Zhongxin also flew to Xikou one hour (3 p.m.) after Wu and others left Nanjing to report to President Chiang, and will return to Nanjing on the 21st.

### Full Text of the CCP's Proposed Peace Agreement, Eight Articles and Twenty-Four Clauses

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 20th] After the government peace talk delegation and the CCP delegation began peace talks in Peiping, the CCP delegation submitted a so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement" to the government delegation. The full text is excerpted as follows:

### Domestic Peace Agreement

The Nanjing National Government of the Republic of China, with the help of the US government, violated the will of the people, broke the ceasefire agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and launched a nationwide civil war against the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the banner of opposing the Chinese Communist Party. This war has lasted for two years and nine and a half months. The people of the whole country have suffered greatly, the country's financial and material resources have suffered great losses, and the country's sovereignty has also suffered great damage. The people of the whole country have long expressed dissatisfaction with the Nanjing National Government's violation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three People's Principles, violation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's correct policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers, and violation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary deathbed testament. The people of the whole country especially oppose the Nanjing National Government's launching of this unprecedented nationwide civil war, and the resulting political, military, financial, economic, cultural, and diplomatic errors and measures. The Nanjing National Government has completely lost trust among the people of the whole country, and in this civil war, the Nanjing National Government's army has been defeated by the People's Liberation Army, which is led by the Chinese Communist Party and commanded by the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission. Based on the above situation, the Nanjing National Government proposed to the Chinese Communist Party on January 1, 1949, to hold negotiations to stop the civil war and restore a state of peace. The Chinese Communist Party issued a statement on January 14 of the same year, agreeing to the above proposal of the Nanjing National Government, and proposed to punish war criminals, abolish the pseudo-constitution, abolish the pseudo-legal system, reorganize all reactionary troops according to democratic principles, confiscate bureaucratic capital, implement land reform, abolish traitorous treaties, convene a new political consultative conference without reactionary elements, establish a democratic coalition government, and take over all the powers of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government and its subordinate governments at all levels. These eight basic conditions have been agreed to by the Nanjing National Government. Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party and the Nanjing Government sent their own delegations, authorized to hold negotiations and sign agreements. Representatives of both sides gathered in Peiping and first confirmed that the Nanjing National Government should bear full responsibility for this civil war and its various erroneous policies, and agreed to establish this agreement.

Article 1, Clause 1: In order to distinguish right from wrong and determine responsibility, the Chinese Communist Party delegation and the Nanjing National Government delegation (hereinafter referred to as both parties) confirm that the war criminals on the Nanjing National Government side who should be responsible for launching and executing this civil war must be punished in principle, but may be handled separately according to the following circumstances: Item 1, all war criminals, regardless of who they are, if they can recognize right from wrong, repent sincerely, have true and sincere expressions, and are conducive to the advancement of the Chinese people's liberation cause, and conducive to solving domestic problems by peaceful means, they will be allowed to cancel the name of war criminals and given lenient treatment. Item 2, all war criminals, regardless of who they are, who are stubborn and unrepentant, hinder the advancement of the people's liberation cause, are not conducive to solving domestic problems by peaceful means, or even incite rebellion, should be severely punished, and those who lead the team to rebel should be responsible for being suppressed by the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission. Clause 2, both parties confirm that the Nanjing National Government's announcement on January 26, 1949, that General Okamura Yasuji, a Japanese war criminal who invaded China, was innocent and released, and its permission on January 31 of the same year to deal with other Japanese items, etc., were wrong. These Japanese war criminals should be re-handled as soon as the Chinese Democratic Coalition Government, that is, the new central government representing all the Chinese people, is established.

Article 2, Clause 3: Both parties confirm that the "Constitution of the Republic of China" passed by the "National Assembly" convened by the Nanjing National Government in November 1946 should be abolished. Clause 4: After the "Constitution of the Republic of China" is abolished, the fundamental law that the Chinese state and people should follow should be implemented in accordance with the resolutions of the new Political Consultative Conference and the Democratic Coalition Government.

Article 3, Clause 5: Both parties confirm that all the legal systems of the Nanjing National Government should be abolished. Clause 6: In the areas where the People's Liberation Army has arrived and taken over, and after the establishment of the Democratic Coalition Government, the people's democratic legal system should be established immediately, and all reactionary laws should be abolished.

Article 4, Clause 7: Both parties confirm that all armed forces belonging to the Nanjing National Government (all army, navy, air force, gendarmerie, transportation police units, local units, all military organs, schools, factories, and rear logistics institutions, etc.) should be reorganized into People's Liberation Army in accordance with democratic principles. After the signing of the Domestic Peace Agreement, a national reorganization committee should be established immediately to be responsible for this reorganization work. The reorganization committee shall consist of seven to nine members, of which four to five will be sent by the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and three to four will be sent by the Nanjing National Government, with one as the director and one of the members sent by the Nanjing National Government as the deputy director. Regional reorganization committee branches may be established as needed in the areas where the People's Liberation Army has arrived and taken over. The ratio of the number of people on both sides in this branch and the sharing of the director and deputy director are the same as in the national reorganization committee. A reorganization committee should be established for the reorganization of the navy and air force. All matters concerning the People's Liberation Army's advance and takeover of the areas currently under the jurisdiction of the Nanjing National Government shall be prescribed by order of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission. When the People's Liberation Army advances, the armed forces belonging to the Nanjing National Government shall not resist. Clause 8: Both parties agree that the reorganization plan for each region shall be carried out in two stages: Item 1, the first stage is the centralized reorganization stage, Point 1: All armed forces belonging to the Nanjing National Government (army, navy, air force, gendarmerie, transportation police corps, and local units, etc.) should be concentrated for reorganization. The reorganization principle should be determined by the reorganization committee based on the actual conditions of each region. In the areas where the People's Liberation Army has arrived and taken over, they should be ordered to go to the designated locations for centralized reorganization in zones and phases according to their original numbers, original organization, and original number of people. Point 2: All armed forces belonging to the Nanjing National Government should be responsible for maintaining local order and preventing any sabotage incidents in the large and small cities, traffic arteries, rivers, seaports, and villages where they are stationed before the People's Liberation Army has arrived and taken over. Point 3: When the People's Liberation Army arrives and takes over in the above areas, the armed forces belonging to the Nanjing National Government should peacefully hand over according to the orders of the reorganization committee and its branches, and go to the designated locations. During the march to the designated locations and after arrival, the armed forces belonging to the Nanjing National Government should strictly abide by discipline and not disrupt local order. Point 4: When the armed forces belonging to the Nanjing National Government leave their original驻地in accordance with the orders of the reorganization committee and its branches, the local police or security forces stationed there should not withdraw, and should be responsible for maintaining local public security and accept the command and orders of the People's Liberation Army. Point 5: During the period of mobilization and concentration of all armed forces belonging to the Nanjing National Government, their food, clothing, and other military supplies shall be resolved by the reorganization committee and its branches and local governments. Point 6: All military organs belonging to the Nanjing National Government (from the Ministry of National Defense to the organs, schools, factories, and warehouses belonging to the United Rear Service Headquarters), all military equipment (military ports, fortresses, air force bases, etc.), and all military materials should be transferred to the People's Liberation Army and its local military control committees in zones and phases according to the reorganization committee and its branches. Item 2, the second stage is the regional reorganization stage, Point 1: After the army troops belonging to the Nanjing National Government (infantry troops, cavalry troops, special forces troops, gendarmerie troops, transportation police troops, and local troops) are concentrated for reorganization in designated locations in zones, the reorganization committee should formulate a regional reorganization plan based on the actual conditions of each region and implement the reorganization on a regular basis. The principle should be to reorganize all the above-mentioned army troops that have been concentrated and reorganized into regular troops of the People's Liberation Army in accordance with the democratic system and regular organization of the People's Liberation Army. Those soldiers who are old, weak, disabled, and found to be true, and who need to retire and volunteer to retire, and those officers who volunteer to retire or change careers (the following text goes to the second edition)

From April 1 to 12, there were many twists and turns, especially on the 9th, when it almost broke down. Later, after direct consultations with Mr. Mao Zedong, it turned around and continued. A formal meeting was held on the 13th, and the CCP immediately proposed a draft peace agreement of eight articles and twenty-four clauses. The government delegation believed that it had to ask the central government for instructions before a decision could be made, and immediately sent representatives Huang Shaohong and advisor Qu Wu to return with the draft peace agreement for the government to study countermeasures. He concluded: The conditions proposed by the CCP have lost the peace plan based on equality and seem to be determined by the victors for the conquered, so the government cannot accept it and has telegraphed the reply to the government representatives in Peiping on the afternoon of the 20th to convey to the CCP.

### Jiangbei Communist Army Launches Full-Scale Offensive: Battles Erupt Across Anqing to Guazhou, Cannon Fire Reaching the Capital Throughout the Night

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Prior to receiving a response from the government regarding the demands of the Chinese Communists, it was reported on the afternoon of the 20th that the Communist authorities had launched a full-scale offensive across the Jiangbei front. The rumbling of artillery fire has penetrated the capital city's atmosphere of peace. The government has decided to hold an important meeting on the 21st to decide on crucial policies such as relocation and response.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] This reporter has learned that after the Chinese Communists issued a general offensive order on the night of the 20th, a telephone conversation was held with a senior military general at 00:10 on the 21st. According to the conversation, from Anqing in the west, passing through Erba, Yuxikou, Xiliangshan, Jiangpu, Huaqiying, Shierxu, to Guazhou and other bridgehead positions on the Jiangbei front, battles have occurred successively since the night of the 20th. Among them, the battles at Yuxikou, Jiangpu, and Shierxu are particularly fierce, with no changes in the Nationalist army's positions.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Amidst the faint hope of peace talks, rumbling cannon fire was heard again from across the capital's riverbank starting in the evening of the 20th. Standing on the rooftop platform of the Fuchi Building, this reporter could even remotely see the white light of artillery shells forming arcs as they were fired, one after another. As a result, the capital's residents once again felt a sense of tension. According to information obtained by this reporter from the military, two regiments of Wu Huawen's troops from the 35th Army of Chen Yi's forces, starting tonight, launched a fierce attack on the Jiangpu city bridgehead from two directions, the Tangquan town and Liuzhuang areas southeast of Quanjiao. After the Nationalist army's Liu Bingzhe unit fought back, and multiple air force planes took off in the dark to drop bombs, and the navy also provided artillery support from the river surface, the fighting was still continuing in the suburbs two or three *huali* away as of 10 p.m. on the 20th.

[Further Dispatch] The Jiangpu battle had moved to within 200-300 meters outside the city by around 1 a.m. on the 21st. The attacking Communist forces are constantly increasing in number. Although the defending troops are outnumbered, they are still fighting valiantly under the coordination of the navy and air force. The sound of artillery fire has not ceased here throughout the night.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] As of 8 p.m. on the 20th, the Nationalist army controls the following bridgeheads downstream from Anqing in Jiangbei: (1) Anqing, (2) Yuxikou and Erba across from Wuhu, (3) Xiliangshan northwest of Dangtu across the river, (4) Jiangpu, (5) the Liangpu area (including Pukou, Puzhen, Huaqiying) across from Xiaguan, (6) Huazikou (across from Qixia Mountain), (7) a narrow area west of Zhenjiang, stretching from Shierxu through Guazhou to Liuxu.

[Further Dispatch] Fierce fighting has continued unabated since the night of the 19th in both the Beishazhou east of Yangzhou and Shierxu southwest of Yangzhou. On the Beishazhou front, the Communist army continued to launch a fierce landing attack on the southern part of Beishazhou under the cover of artillery fire on the night of the 19th. The local Nationalist army team defending the island, ultimately outmatched in strength, fought valiantly until the morning of the 20th and then actively withdrew to Yangzhou under the cover of the navy and air force. On the Shierxu front, the blitz offensive launched by the Communist army in the past three days has been frustrated due to the strong counterattack by the defending troops and the Nationalist navy and air force, resulting in heavy casualties. The offensive has weakened since this afternoon.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 20th] The situation at the Liuxu bridgehead, across the river from Zhenjiang, tightened last night. At 9 p.m., fierce fighting broke out on the eastern, western, and northern sides of the Liuxu outpost. After the defending troops bravely fought back, the Communist army failed to succeed and retreated slightly. Furthermore, civilian houses in Changjiaqiao, two *li* north of Liuxu, and the Gaoxu embankment in the northwest corner were set ablaze and burned down by Communist artillery shells. Today, the front line in Jiangbei returned to quiet during the day, with no major activity around Shierxu and Guazhou.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] More than a thousand Communist boats of various types are gathered in Tuqiao across from Tongling and in the Liujiadu and Taiyangzhou areas downstream. Starting at 5 p.m. on the 20th, the Communist army on the north bank began shelling the Nationalist army's positions between Tongling and Digang on the south bank, attempting to cover the forced crossing of these boats to the south. The Nationalist army's artillery on the south bank, in coordination with the navy, responded with artillery fire. The artillery battle was still in progress as of late evening.

[Our Wuhu Dispatch, 20th] The outskirts of Anqing, which had been quiet for many days, saw the resurgence of fierce fighting starting on the night of the 20th. At the same time, there was brief contact at Erba, Yuxikou across the river from here, and Xiliangshan downstream yesterday. After being repulsed, the Communist army's 30th and 25th Armies launched a large-scale attack again tonight. After being ambushed by the Nationalist army's Yang Gancai unit, the fighting is still ongoing. It is reported that the Communist forces gathered in the Chao, Chu, and He counties area number up to seven armies.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] According to a Hangkou dispatch from the Military News Agency, the Chinese Communist army has been generally shifting east in recent days. A four-line slogan is currently popular within their army: (1) Liquidate Shanghai, (2) Break through Nanjing, (3) Crush Guangzhou, (4) Isolate Wuhan. The Nationalist army is paying close attention to this.

Editorial

### How Will the People Save Themselves?

Yesterday, the government replied to the Chinese Communist's final ultimatum as scheduled, requesting the Chinese Communists, for the sake of the people's interests, to reconsider their attitude and revise the eight articles and twenty-four clauses of their so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement." At the same time, the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang also issued a solemn statement regarding these clauses, explaining the responsibility for the years of war and requesting an immediate ceasefire and revision of the clauses by the central government to facilitate the peace talks. It can be seen that the government and the Kuomintang still earnestly hope that the door to peace talks will not be closed, and the overall situation of China, whether it be peace or war, still hinges on a single thought of the Chinese Communists.

The Chinese Communist's eight articles and twenty-four clauses were formally announced by the government last night. Whether the content is harsh is obvious to all. What the general public wants to ask is: Since the government claims that the Chinese Communist's clauses are unequal, unreasonable, and not an attitude of peace talks, and requests the Chinese Communists to reconsider and first cease fire, what will the Chinese Communists do next? In fact, judging from yesterday's situation, it can be predicted that the Chinese Communists will strengthen their offensive and attempt to cross the river in one go. What we want to ask is not whether the Chinese Communists are determined to attack, nor when the government should respond, but how the people themselves can exert their power to save themselves?

The Chinese Communists constantly invoke the "liberation" of the people as their slogan. Then, what the people suffer from the most today is undoubtedly the war, that is, what they most need to be "liberated" from is the suffering of war. Why, after peace talks have been going on for two weeks, has the cannon fire of the Communist army attempting to cross the river not only not stopped, but has become increasingly fierce? Is it necessary to do so to be called "liberating" the people? When the Political Consultative Conference was about to convene in the winter of the 34th year, the Chinese Communist representative Zhou Enlai insisted that a ceasefire must be ordered first, otherwise it would be deemed as having no sincerity for peace. Therefore, the National Government issued a ceasefire order on January 10th of the 35th year, allowing the Political Consultative Conference to finally achieve results. (Later, the Chinese Communists did not fulfill the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, which is another matter.) Why has the government repeatedly requested a ceasefire before the start of this round of peace talks, but the Chinese Communists have ignored it and instead sent large numbers of troops from North China to the south, preparing to cross the river in a large-scale attack? Is this large-scale attack a symbol of peace? The Chinese Communists have a preface of thousands of words before the eight articles and twenty-four clauses, severely criticizing the Kuomintang and assigning them the blame for the war. We are unwilling to defend the Kuomintang, and we will not even discuss the question of who is responsible for the war, but the responsibility for not being willing to cease fire today clearly lies with the Chinese Communists. No matter how hard they try to explain, they cannot justify it. Is this not because the Chinese Communists are proud of their victory and treat the war as a game? How many times have they truly considered the suffering of the people?

Since the Chinese Communists do not care about the suffering of the people and have already launched attacks to cross the river along the Jiangbei coast, today's situation is that the Chinese Communists are challenging and the government will be forced to respond. For the past three and a half months, the peace that the people of the whole country have shouted themselves hoarse to call for, the peace that President Chiang and Acting President Li have sought at the cost of resignation and humiliation, has finally been destroyed by the rumbling cannons and raging flames of the Chinese Communists yesterday. The atmosphere of peace and harmony guided by President Chiang's original proclamation has left our people with only a dream of peace. Who is dedicated to seeking peace? Who is destroying peace? At this point, it is not difficult to obtain a clear proof. Previously, some people may have thought that the government's sincerity was not enough, but given Acting President Li's forbearance and humble appeal to the Chinese Communists, it cannot be said that the government's sincerity in seeking peace is insufficient. However, even this is not enough to move the arrogant Chinese Communists. Even Acting President Li, President He of the Executive Yuan, and the members of the Peace Issues Committee all believe that what the Chinese Communists have proposed is not peace terms, but the verdict of the victors on the vanquished. Then, how will we, the people, save ourselves from those warmongering Chinese Communists who do not give us peace?

To be honest, the Chinese Communist's final ultimatum, the so-called eight articles and twenty-four clauses, cannot be regarded as a peace agreement, nor is it merely a verdict on the government and the Kuomintang, but it is a disposition on the Republic of China and the 450 million people. It wants to disarm all the naval and air forces that defended the country during the eight-year War of Resistance and reorganize them into a Communist army that worships Marxism-Leninism; it wants to form a coalition government controlled solely by the Chinese Communists and abolish all previous laws, including the Constitution of the Republic of China; it wants to confiscate all large-scale factories and liquidate the property of all people above a certain amount; it wants to take over all government agencies and subject all service personnel to communist ideological training; it accuses the United States, the ally that helped us the most during and after the war, and wants to cut off the friendly relations between China and the United States by abolishing the "traitorous treaties," leaving China isolated and without assistance in the future. In short, if the government is forced to have its peace representatives sign this ultimatum of the Chinese Communists, then China will inevitably become a communist state supported by the Red Army and be locked behind the Iron Curtain. National independence and people's freedom will all be sacrificed to this agreement without anyone realizing it. Fortunately, the government authorities have the courage of responsible people, and for the long-term interests of the country and the people, they are unwilling to sign rashly, but demand that the Chinese Communists change their attitude, thus preserving a glimmer of hope for our country and people.

Therefore, if the government is forced to respond to war in the future, it will be fighting for the independence of the country, fighting for the freedom of the people, and also fighting for the true and lasting peace that we seek. This unavoidable response is of great importance to the interests of the people, and we, the people, have no reason to stand by idly, especially the peace-loving and freedom-loving people have no reason to be indifferent. Then, if the flames of war extend to both sides of the Yangtze River, how should we, the people, rise up to save ourselves? A twelve- or thirteen-year-old primary school student in Peiping wrote a letter to his father in Shanghai a few days ago, saying that it is now impossible to find a small room where he can breathe free air! Do we want freedom? Then save ourselves quickly!

### Two British Warships Repeatedly Shelled Near the Port, Heavy Casualties, One Ship Sailed to the Capital for Repairs, British Ambassador Instructed the Consul-General in Tianjin to Protest to the Communist Side

[Central News Agency, this City] According to British naval authorities here, this morning of the 20th, the British small warship HMS Amethyst reported by telegraph: The ship, en route from Shanghai to the capital, was shelled about eighty miles east of Nanjing in the middle of the river. There were several deaths and injuries on board, and the source of the shells is unknown. However, the ship notified the Chinese government before leaving Shanghai. The HMS Amethyst has a displacement of 2,000 tons and is commanded by Captain B.N. Skinner. Details are being investigated.

It is also understood that the location where the British warship HMS Amethyst was shelled is near the port, so people here generally believe that the shells that bombarded the ship came from the Communist-controlled area of Jiangbei.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 20th] The British Embassy announced at 9:30 this morning that the embassy has received a report from the British gunboat HMS Amethyst, stating that the ship encountered heavy artillery fire, ran aground, and suffered heavy casualties. The incident occurred about ten miles east of the port on the north bank of the Yangtze River, about thirty miles from Zhenjiang. Further details are awaited. It is believed here that the ship's telegram was sent under extremely critical circumstances. The British destroyers HMS Consort and HMS Black Swan have departed from the capital and Shanghai respectively to assist at the scene. HMS Amethyst was en route to Nanjing to replace HMS Consort in protecting British nationals in Nanjing. The ship has British national emblems on both sides. The ship left Shanghai on the 19th and stopped overnight in Jiangyin.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 20th] Following the shelling of the British gunboat HMS Amethyst near the port this morning by artillery fire from the Communist forces on the north bank, another British warship, the destroyer HMS Consort, was also shelled by Communist artillery fire while sailing downstream from the capital to assist the HMS Amethyst. Both ships suffered heavy casualties. The HMS Consort sailed downstream along the river. It first discovered the HMS Amethyst aground outside Taipingzhou, fifteen miles east of Zhenjiang, but was unable to provide assistance due to the intense artillery fire from the Communist forces on the north bank. The HMS Consort returned fire while accelerating downstream, arriving in Jiangyin in the afternoon, where it met the British destroyer HMS Black Swan sailing upstream from Shanghai. It is also learned that the British 10,000-ton cruiser HMS London, which was originally sailing from Hong Kong to Shanghai for a routine visit, changed course and sailed upstream after receiving the news. Vice Admiral Madden, Deputy Commander of the British Far East Fleet, is personally on board the HMS London. According to a Hong Kong dispatch, another British cruiser, HMS Belfast, sailed north from Hong Kong tonight, presumably heading to Shanghai.

[Reuters, this City] Authoritative sources told our agency that British Ambassador Sir Stevenson has instructed the British Consul-General in Tianjin to protest to the Communist authorities in Peiping regarding the shelling of British warships on the Yangtze River.

[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] A British Embassy spokesperson announced today that the British Embassy has officially notified the Ministry of National Defense regarding the "Amethyst" incident.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] The British warship HMS Amethyst arrived in Xiaguan this afternoon and is moored for repairs. (More news on page four)

The calculation of the interest income tax in the third category, those who pay within the prescribed time limit should directly calculate the tax amount according to the proportional tax rate stipulated by the Income Tax Law.

As for the ordinary citizens who have been worried for days that the "gold ban" will affect their own lives and that the depreciation of the Hong Kong dollar may have serious consequences, they have been uneasy.

Cabbage sells for 30,000 gold yuan notes per catty, pork for 180,000, and a meal costs 300,000 gold yuan notes for first class and 240,000 for this class.

The garrison headquarters began arresting vendors on a large scale at 6 p.m., and the sound of coins disappeared in the evening.

### Paris Peace Conference Opens: Chairman Joliot-Curie Explains the Conference's Purpose: To Prevent War and Establish Peace

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 20th] The World Peace Conference was opened here this morning by French atomic energy expert Frédéric Joliot-Curie as chairman. After he expressed his welcome to representatives from various countries, especially those from Democratic China, the Republic of Indonesia, and the Viet Minh, he emphasized his belief that science has the mission of civilizing the world. He declared that one of the most serious distortions of science's mission currently is in relation to the atomic bomb, a weapon that has been used for collective destruction. Joliot-Curie continued: "It is regrettable that scientific research is kept secret; and scientists should pay attention to how their inventions are used." Joliot-Curie stated emphatically that scientists should demand that science benefit humanity. In conclusion, Joliot-Curie declared that the purpose of the World Peace Conference is to prevent the ongoing wars and establish peace, which is our most important goal. Preventing war cannot be achieved by one nation or one person. We call on all honest people in the world to help us prevent war from happening.

The letter continued: "In the debate on the passage of this amendment, the overwhelming majority of opinions in the Senate believed that the Netherlands' use of force in Indonesia, and its continuous refusal to implement the Security Council's resolutions on stopping the conflict and other steps for the peaceful resolution of the Indonesian dispute, were improper actions that violated world peace and security interests. In view of these facts, we sincerely urge the President to instruct the Secretary of State and the US delegation to the United Nations to take immediate action to ensure that the United Nations implements its resolutions on the Dutch-Indonesian conflict." It is reported that the letter was initiated by Republican Senator Bridges, who has always advocated adopting a tough policy of suspending aid to the Netherlands.

### War Flares Up Again in Mandalay, Burma

[United Press, Rangoon, 20th] The historical city of Mandalay experienced warfare again on the 20th.

[Reuters, Rangoon, 19th] After Burmese government forces recaptured the important town of Maymyo, 35 miles west of Mandalay, they issued a 48-hour ultimatum today to the "White Flag" rebels inside Mandalay, ordering them to come out of the city to fight, otherwise the government forces would attack Mandalay and annihilate the rebels.

### Admiral Kirk Succeeds Smith as US Ambassador to the Soviet Union: Clark Rumored to be Appointed Commander of US Forces in Germany

[Our Report] Washington, 20th Dispatch: President Truman has appointed Admiral Kirk as Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Kirk is currently the Ambassador to Belgium.

### Attlee Holds Informal Talks with Commonwealth Prime Ministers: Formal Plenary Session Postponed to Tomorrow Morning

[Reuters, London, 20th] The British Commonwealth Prime Ministers have begun individual and informal talks this morning, but the first formal plenary session will begin on Friday morning. Attending this meeting are British Prime Minister Attlee, as well as the Prime Ministers of Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, and Ceylon, and Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson. There is only one item on the agenda of the meeting, namely the relationship between India and the British Commonwealth after India declares itself a republic.

Prime Minister Attlee has begun informal individual talks with the Prime Ministers this morning. Political figures also believe that although the relationship between India and the British Commonwealth is the theme of the discussion at this meeting, the Prime Ministers will also study some new ways to maintain the cooperation of the Commonwealth based on a "relationship of understanding" instead of the more formal connection currently in place.

### The Content of the Federal Conference is Prepared to be Kept Secret

[United Press, London, 20th] Officials believe that the meeting is expected to last seven days, and Pearson will express his hope that the meeting can be closed on the 30th of this month.

Nehru told reporters before boarding the plane to London: "We do not want to participate in mutually hostile powerful groups. This is not only a policy of neutrality, but also a positive step to solve world problems. We hope to promote international peace and friendship through this. I believe that India can not only serve India and Asia in this respect, but also serve the world." Nehru will go to London to attend the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference. He said that when discussing India's status in the Commonwealth, he will abide by the instructions given to them by the Congress Party.

### New Japanese Budget Approved: Senate Plenary Session Passed Without Amendment: Parliamentary Session Decided to be Extended by 25 Days

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] In the Japanese fiscal year 1949 budget bill, there was an amendment from three opposition parties, including the Socialist Party, in the Senate. The Chairman of the Budget Committee of the Senate, Kurokawa, and the members Hatano and Kanie (Socialist Party) originally planned to visit MacArthur's headquarters this morning to make a final effort on the amendment issue. As a result of exchanging opinions with all parties, they believed that there was absolutely no room for change in MacArthur's headquarters' instructions, so they gave up. After the committee passed it this morning, the plenary session this afternoon also passed it without amendment, and the support for the fiscal year 1949 budget bill was announced.

[Another Dispatch] After the budget bill was passed, the Japanese government proposed to extend the parliamentary session, which would not affect the timely passage of the budget bill, and would also allow other important bills to be discussed one by one. Since the Liberal Party controls the absolute number in both houses, there is no doubt that the extension will be approved. As a result of a meeting of the standing committee of the Senate yesterday, it was decided to take the same steps as the House of Representatives and allow the session to be extended by 25 days.

### US Aid to China Program Extended to February Next Year

[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] Truman signed the $5.58 billion European Recovery Program's compromise bill between the two houses today. The China Aid plan attached to the bill can therefore be extended to February next year. Last year, the US Congress approved an appropriation of assistance to China, and the remaining $54 million of the $275 million can be used. According to the provisions of the bill, this amount can only be used in non-Communist controlled areas of China. The House bill originally stipulated that the remaining funds need to go through the re-appropriation procedure, but the compromise bill has canceled this case.

### Tentative Suggestions from the Soviets Regarding the Berlin Question: The United States Consults Britain and France; East Germany Could Complete Preparations for Statehood by June

[Reuters, London, 20th] Well-informed sources here claim that recent newspaper reports of Soviet feelers towards the U.S. regarding the possibility of reopening Four-Power negotiations on the German problem if the Berlin blockade were lifted are substantially accurate. The Soviet overture was entirely informal in nature, and the outcome remains uncertain. The U.S. government has consulted with Britain and France on the matter and has sought clarification from the Soviets on the concrete steps for lifting the Berlin blockade.

The British position is that the blockade must be lifted before a Four-Power Foreign Ministers' conference can be convened, and the establishment of a West German government must not be halted by Four-Power negotiations. The British government will not support measures aimed solely at delaying West German political independence.

[Reuters, Berlin, 19th] German sources close to the Soviet military administration report that the Soviet authorities in Berlin have instructed politicians in the Soviet zone to complete plans for establishing an East German government by June 1. The arrival in Berlin of Dekanozov, the last Soviet ambassador to Germany before the war, is believed to be related to this matter. According to German newspapers, Dekanozov told Soviet zone political leaders today that once the East German government is established and a peace treaty is signed, there will no longer be any need to demand reparations. It is generally believed that East Germany will not take the final step of establishing a government until West Germany is formally established, solidifying the division of Germany. However, all technical preparations for establishing East Germany will be completed by June 1. German sources also report that elections for the German People's Congress will be held throughout the Soviet zone on May 15 and 16. After the elections, the German People's Congress will convene immediately to give final approval to the constitution. If events proceed smoothly, the establishment of the All-German Republic will be announced. British and American officials here are largely reserved about the various reports coming from the German side. They feel that reliable information regarding Soviet intentions is still lacking and therefore decline to comment on the various rumors circulating.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 19th] Soviet sources today dismissed as "completely absurd" reports that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Dekanozov had arrived in Berlin.

### Acheson Discusses U.S.-Soviet Relations: The Door to Peace Talks Remains Open

[Report from this newspaper] Washington, 20th Broadcast: Acheson refused to comment on reports of a new Soviet peace initiative at a press conference today. Acheson reiterated his remarks from last week, saying that if the Soviet Union wishes to negotiate with the U.S. government, the door to all peace talks remains open. He also said that the Soviet Union must first end the blockade of Berlin before the Four Powers can hold talks.

### U.S. Plan to Arm Western Europe: Senate Foreign Relations Committee to Hold Closed Meeting Today; Secretary of State Acheson to Report

[United Press, Washington, 19th] Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that the committee will hold a closed meeting tomorrow, with Secretary of State Acheson attending to report on the military aid plan for the Atlantic Pact allies and to provide a detailed report on the situation in Germany. The meeting will decide when to announce the military aid plan for Europe and when to begin discussing the ratification of the Atlantic Pact.

Connally made it clear that a decision had not yet been made on when to announce the plan, which may be kept secret until the Senate ratifies the Atlantic Treaty. Connally revealed that a dispute has arisen between the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Armed Services Committee. Senator Tydings, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, requested that the military aid plan for Europe be discussed by his committee. Meanwhile, Senators are developing two amendments to the Atlantic Treaty. Democratic Senators Douglas and McMahon plan to propose that the United Nations adopt the principle of non-aggression of the Atlantic Treaty as a supplement to the United Nations Charter. Republican Senators Flanders and others plan to propose amending the Atlantic Treaty to create a smaller United Nations composed of the twelve signatory countries, operating within the framework of the UN General Assembly.

### Yoshida Considers Neutrality Unsafe for Japan

Uncertainty About Whether a Peace Treaty Can Be Achieved

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Yoshida, in response to questions from members of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee today regarding Japan's permanent neutrality, the prospects for a security treaty and peace conference, provisional arrangements for the month, and trade relations with the Chinese government, stated: (1) Reports that the Emperor met with Dr. Mott and expressed a desire for permanent neutrality are mistaken. Regarding external permanent neutrality, such as that of Belgium, although its neutrality was guaranteed by treaty, it was the first to be ravaged in the European war. Therefore, while I believe that the goodwill behind permanent neutrality is a separate matter, the example of Belgium illustrates that it should be considered with caution. In other words, it is not that external permanent neutrality is difficult, but whether it can guarantee Japan's security is questionable. If it can guarantee security, it would be fortunate for Japan. Furthermore, Japan's future security guarantees are being discussed at the peace conference, and I cannot explicitly answer in my official capacity; (2) Considering Japan's international situation, it can be said that it has improved in some respects. However, due to the opposition between the United States and the Soviet Union and other factors, it is impossible to predict whether a peace treaty can be achieved unanimously; (3) Regarding the CCP government, I have no information other than news reports. It seems that peaceful negotiations are underway, but it cannot be considered successful yet, and it is difficult to predict future developments. However, regarding relations with China, I hope to begin trade as soon as possible; (4) It is doubtful whether a movement to promote a peace conference can be launched, or whether a treaty issue review committee can be established after the parliament. If MacArthur does not consider it, the issue should be discussed separately; (5) Regarding the re-examination of the Far Eastern Commission and the resolution of the Japanese Constitution, I have not heard of anything directly. The government currently has no intention of amending the constitution."

### Geneva Conference to Discuss Revision of Red Cross Agreements: Representatives from Fifty-Six Countries Attending

[United Press, Geneva, 19th] Representatives from fifty-six countries, including the U.S. and the Soviet Union, will meet on the 21st to conduct a comprehensive review of the Red Cross agreements in light of total war. Two Japanese experts and two members of the military government stationed in Japan will attend the conference. The Soviet delegation includes 29 representatives, led by an official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The conference will discuss new Red Cross agreements, establishing defense zones for civilians as a precaution against the possible use of atomic bombs.

### UN General Assembly Permits Hungarian and Bulgarian Representatives to Attend to Explain Cases of Mistreatment of Clergy

[United Press, Lake Success, 19th] The Political Committee today, by a vote of 17 to 1, with 31 abstentions including the U.S. and the Soviet Union, passed a motion to invite representatives from Hungary and Bulgaria to attend and explain the cases of the detention of Cardinal Mindszenty and other church leaders.

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 20th Broadcast: Lake Success News, British representative Jebb and U.S. representative adopted the same position, opposing the Cuban representative's proposal to establish a fifteen-member committee to investigate the cases of accused clergy. Jebb quoted the Hungarian Yellow Book, stating that "There must have been a confession during Cardinal Mindszenty's trial. Needless to say, the confession will limit Cardinal Mindszenty to the crimes he is accused of. I believe there is no need for investigation, and I can offer many reasons to prove that it is not." New Zealand representative Berendsen also condemned the impropriety of the clergy condemnation cases, believing that such events are international issues that the UN General Assembly has the right to address.

### Conflicting Opinions on Handling Former Italian Colonies: Egypt Demands to Acquire Part of the Territory

[Reuters, Lake Success, 20th] Almost half of the UN member states have expressed their opinions on the Italian colonies, but it is difficult to predict what the final resolution of the General Assembly on this matter will be. So far, the opinions of the 29 countries that have expressed their views can be summarized as follows:

Seventeen countries support entrusting Cyrenaica to British trusteeship, while Italian Somaliland should be returned to Italy under a trusteeship agreement. Twelve countries advocate placing Tripolitania under Italian rule, while ten countries support French administration of the Fezzan region of Libya. Furthermore, most countries agree that part of Eritrea should be ceded to Abyssinia to give it access to the sea. In general, opinions in the UN General Assembly's Political Committee on the issue of Italian colonies can be divided into two camps: one advocates placing all colonies under UN trusteeship, while the other advocates individual trusteeship. The first camp, led by India, the Soviet Union, and Arab countries, has a total of eighteen votes. Although this number is not enough to pass their proposal, it is enough to prevent the other camp from obtaining a two-thirds majority needed to pass their proposal.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 19th] Egyptian Foreign Minister Khashaba submitted a small request regarding the Italian colonies to the Political Committee today. Khashaba claimed that the request was very small in terms of economics and territory, but it was important for Egypt to open up the base for foreign intrusions outside of Egypt. The land Egypt wants to acquire is the Giarabub oasis and the Sollum desert plain on the border between Egypt and Cyrenaica, because it is the natural boundary of Egypt. The Uruguayan representative proposed the formation of an eleven-member committee to draft a proposal regarding the fate of the Italian colonies. The committee did not vote on the proposal and adjourned until Wednesday.

### The Spanish Question: Political Committee to Discuss Today

[United Press, Lake Success, 20th] It is reported that Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia will request the United Nations to amend its resolution to send envoys to reside in Spain. The UN General Assembly Political Committee is scheduled to begin discussing the Spanish question on the 21st.

### Wage Research Committee Agrees: Index Still to be Published Twice; Payments to be Calculated Based on Silver Dollar Market Price; to be Submitted to Labor-Management Evaluation Committee for Further Discussion

The Economic Commission's Wage Research Committee held a meeting at 2 PM yesterday in the City Hall conference room, chaired by Secretary-General Chen. First, Social Affairs Bureau Director Cao Peizi presented six proposed methods for wage research, which were submitted for discussion, including: (1) Calculate and pay wages based on the value of silver dollars, using the worker's base salary at the "August 19th" price limit, discounted by half, and then paying wages according to the market price of silver dollars at that time, thus abolishing the cost of living index; (2) Calculate and pay Gold Yuan based on the silver dollar price at the time of each bi-monthly publication of the cost of living index; (3) Publish the cost of living index twice a month. On the 8th of each month, pay wages for the 1st to the 7th according to the index from the end of the previous month, while also pre-paying wages for the 8th to the 15th; on the 23rd, pay wages for the 16th to the 22nd according to the cost of living index published on the 15th, and pre-pay wages for the 23rd to the end of the month; supplementary payments to be made when the monthly mid-month and end-of-month indices are published; (4) With reference to the current public utility salary payment method, pay half a month's salary for the 1st to the 15th based on the end-of-month index on the 5th of each month, pay one month's salary based on the index published on the 15th on the 20th, and deduct the half-month's salary borrowed on the 5th when the index is published on the 30th; (5) Implement a weekly salary system, with the index published once a week and salaries paid weekly; (6) Use in-kind goods to offset wages. Regarding the above methods, Cao stated that the issue of how to obtain a unified price for silver dollars should be considered. If wages are calculated in silver dollars, should commodity prices also be quoted in silver dollars? Next, Zhou Xuexiang, a representative of the General Labor Union, proposed three principles for salary payment: (1) Base salary discounted by half and paid in silver dollars, using Yuan coins as the standard before silver dollar prices are unified; (2) Pay silver dollars to those with silver dollars, and convert and pay Gold Yuan to those without silver dollars. Employees may not refuse; (3) Each company and factory may set its own salary payment date to avoid affecting prices on salary payment days. Subsequently, Pan Shih-hao, Tian He-qing, Lu Jing-shi, Yan E-sheng, and others expressed their opinions successively. Finally, Secretary-General Chen summarized the general opinions and decided to temporarily adopt the second method reported by Director Cao, that is, the cost of living index will still be published twice a month, and wages will be converted and paid in Gold Yuan based on the silver dollar price at the time of index publication. However, Zhou Xuexiang reiterated his opinion, requesting that the prices used in the index should be calculated based on the highest market price in the half month. If this is not adopted, the General Labor Union will refuse to send personnel to participate in meetings related to this issue. It was later decided to submit this discussion result to the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee for decision; the opinions of the General Labor Union, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Municipal Industrial Association will be submitted to the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee for review. The meeting adjourned at 4 PM.

### Standing Committee of the General Labor Union Discusses Salary Payment Methods for Employees

The Shanghai General Labor Union convened its third Standing Committee meeting at 10 AM yesterday. The meeting was attended by Zhou Xuexiang, Sun Wenyuan, Qiu Changjiang, Huang Yuexiang, Fang Rusheng, Ye Xianggao, and others. The meeting was chaired by Zhou Xuexiang. The important resolutions are as follows: (1) Measures to solve the current threat to employees' livelihoods: 1. Employees' salaries should be paid in silver dollars, discounted by half from the base salary in Gold Yuan (calculated in Yuan coins before silver dollar prices are unified). 2. If employers do not have enough silver dollars to pay salaries, they should convert and pay Gold Yuan according to the market price on the day of payment. Employees may not refuse. 3. Employees' salaries should be paid by industry and on different days to avoid banknote shortages, panic buying, and stimulating price increases. However, the original salary payment date agreements between labor and management should not be changed at will. 4. After the implementation of the weekly salary system, the first and third salary payments of the month should be used as advance payments, which should be settled in the second and fourth salary payments. (2) Secretary-General Liang Yongzhang will go abroad to participate in the Asian Labor Conference. The position of Secretary-General will be temporarily filled by Deputy Secretary-General Sun Wenyuan. (3) Liang Yongzhang and Shui Xiangyun will go abroad to participate in the Asian Labor Conference. The vacancy for a member of the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee will be temporarily filled by Sun Wenyuan and Fang Rusheng.

Another news: General Labor Union representatives Zhou Xuexiang, Fang Rusheng, Sun Wenyuan, and Huang Yuexiang jointly issued the following statement yesterday regarding their attendance at the City Government's wage issue meeting: "Since the devaluation of the Gold Yuan and the rampant rise in prices, the average cost of living index has deviated greatly from the actual prices and cannot be used as the standard for wage payments. This is an undeniable fact. Representatives from various industry labor unions have come to the Union one after another, requesting that salaries be converted into silver dollars at half of the Gold Yuan base salary, which is a permanent solution. We have made suggestions to the Municipal Government authorities and have been discussing the matter for days. All parties believe that it is indeed necessary to convert and pay wages based on the value of silver dollars, but before it is implemented, there is an urgent need for a transitional measure. Today, the City Government reconvened the Industrial Association, the Chamber of Commerce, and representatives from this Union to hold a meeting (omitted). The measures stipulated by Acting Mayor Chen are beneficial in maintaining the value of the currency after the publication of the cost of living index, but the issue of how to bring the index closer to prices, which is of great concern to all parties, has not yet been resolved. Therefore, while we can accept the section proposed by Acting Mayor Chen, it is only considered a reasonable solution if the compilation of the index reaches the highest price of each period, as proposed by this Union in the past, as the salary index. Otherwise, we did not participate in the vote on the decision and cannot be held responsible for it. In short, we believe that this case is of great importance, and we are not adhering to our own opinions. We dare not act rashly because we are worried about the situation, and we are afraid that all sectors of society will not understand the truth. Therefore, we make this joint statement."

### Kuomintang Municipal Party Headquarters Sends Telegram to the Whole Country in Response to the Five Principles of the Central Executive Committee: Striving for the Realization of Comprehensive, Reasonable, Honorable and Peaceful Peace

[Central News Agency] The Kuomintang Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, in order to support the five principles statement of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, yesterday (20th) sent a telegram to the whole country, stating as follows:

To all provincial and municipal party headquarters, all overseas party headquarters, all newspapers, and to be forwarded to all groups and compatriots throughout the country for your consideration: Since Generalissimo Chiang initiated peace and retired to his hometown, and Acting President Li has spared no effort to sincerely seek peace, the People's Representatives have flown north several times to negotiate, and the peace talks have begun. For several months, the government and the Party have endured humiliation and sought compromise in every possible way, making concessions again and again, all in order to achieve the genuine and comprehensive peace that the people of the country have been praying for day and night. However, the CCP initially abused and insulted the Party and the government. Then, they threatened us with Mao Zedong's eight conditions. Now, they are creating further complications and intensifying their demands, proposing so-called 24 articles and setting a deadline for the government to respond, as if it were an ultimatum. At the same time, they went back on their word and stopped fighting, and launched a fierce attack on the Kuomintang army's bridgehead in Jiangbei, trapping our Yonganzhou, Gaoqiao and other places. They also began large-scale sneak crossings northeast of Zhenjiang, intending to force the government to surrender through both political and military means. Their intentions are extremely vicious. The conditions are even more harsh, which can be said to be unprecedented in China and abroad. This is intolerable, who can tolerate it? The concessions made in peace talks must have a minimum limit, and the attainment of peace must also have a basic scope. Beyond this, it is not seeking peace, but forcing surrender; beyond this, it is not peace, but treason. The Central Executive Committee of the Party yesterday made a consistent statement on the current peace talks, that the name of the Republic of China cannot be changed, the basic freedoms and rights of the people enshrined in the Constitution cannot be deprived, the integrity and independence of national sovereignty cannot be harmed, and social and economic reforms cannot be carried out by violent means. This is the minimum standard for governing the country, appealing to the whole country and making it public to the world. All the points raised are not only the foundation of our country, but also the minimum requirements for the lives of our people. They are not only fair and just, but also reasonable and in line with human feelings. They are not only the views of our Party comrades, but also the common aspirations of all righteous people in the country. If the CCP blindly believes in the omnipotence of force, and still considers even these minimum requirements unacceptable, and ignores public opinion and the lives of the people, and insists on crossing the river, then the responsibility for destroying the peace talks is already very clear. Party comrades and compatriots throughout the country, in order to be loyal to the Party, protect the Party, and defend our homes and country, we can only rise up together and make a final stand with the CCP. We would rather be jade shattered than tile complete. We would rather die for justice and freedom than live as subjugated slaves. At this critical moment in the peace talks, this Committee did not dare to remain silent. Therefore, we specifically send a telegram to at home and abroad, in addition to responding to the five principles of the Central Executive Committee, and we hope that Party comrades at home and abroad, and compatriots throughout the country, will unite and sacrifice and fight together for this goal, in order to strive for the realization of a comprehensive, equal, reasonable, honorable and peaceful peace. Then the Party will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate. Printed by the Executive Committee of the Kuomintang Shanghai Special Municipality

The main points are as follows: (1) These measures are formulated in accordance with the principle of allowing the circulation of silver dollars as stipulated in the amended financial reform plan of the Ministry of Finance. (2) All banks in this city that have a business license from the Ministry of Finance (including trust companies and money shops), companies and firms that have a company license from the Ministry of Economic Affairs or the Ministry of Industry and Commerce or a business registration certificate from the Social Affairs Bureau, and vendors who have a permit from the Police Bureau who intend to operate concurrently. (3) Banks, money shops, companies, and firms should prepare an application in duplicate, together with the company's business license or business registration certificate, and attach two photos, and submit it to the Social Affairs Bureau for a license. Vendors should prepare an application, together with the vendor's permit and a four-inch photo, and three recent one-inch photos of the vendor, find a reliable shop as a guarantor, and apply to the Police Bureau for approval. Those who have not obtained a company license and a vendor's permit can also apply, but they must add a capital certificate, the amount of capital must be more than 50 silver dollars, and a bank, money shop, or reliable shop must act as a guarantor. (4) Silver dollar prices and trading permits should be displayed in a conspicuous place. Vendors will be issued number plates, which should be worn on the body. (5) A seal of the bank, shop or firm will be stamped when selling silver dollars. (6) After the Social Affairs Bureau has formulated the measures, it will submit them to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation.

### Beijing-Shanghai Railway Clear and Unobstructed: All Trains Arrive at the North Station on Time

Yesterday, there were rumors that Zhenjiang Station was tight and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway was interrupted. The spokesperson of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau yesterday strongly denied this, stating that the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is still clear and unobstructed. He pointed out that the Beijing-Shanghai 5th Express arrived at the North Station on time at 2:30 PM yesterday, which can also prove that the rumors of Zhenjiang Station being tight in the morning are unfounded. However, he stated that when the Beijing-Shanghai night express passes through the Yaohuamen to Zhenjiang section, all train lights are turned off to avoid being targeted by the Communist army.

### Shortage of Industrial Raw Materials: Social Affairs Bureau Submits a Request for Remedies

In order to understand the actual difficulties of the industrial sector in the city and to actively find ways to store raw materials for June, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives from 44 industries in the city a month ago to inquire about the sources of industrial raw materials for each factory and the actual situation of each industry. It is now learned that the Social Affairs Bureau has completed the investigation last week. Wang Jiashu, Director of the Economic Administration Department of the Bureau, told reporters yesterday that all industries have common difficulties, especially the machinery and steel industries. The raw material merchants do not have enough of various raw materials in their hands. After checking, it was found that there are two difficulties: (1) Domestic raw materials such as tobacco, cowhide, coking coal, and soybeans have always been imported from North China, but recently, due to the political situation and transportation relations, it is impossible to communicate and purchase. (2) For foreign raw materials, most manufacturers are unable to settle foreign exchange due to economic reasons. The foreign exchange for the seventh and eighth seasons has not yet been settled, and some of the foreign exchange for the fifth and sixth seasons has not yet been settled. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau is now preparing to submit the above situation to the Municipal Government and request that it be discussed in the Economic Joint Report, and that the Central Government be requested to provide raw material loans or find ways to settle foreign exchange on its behalf, so as to avoid the collapse of the city's industry.

### This Year's Conscription Work: Plan to Recruit Volunteers First; Difficulties in Implementation Will Be Carefully Considered

Regarding this year's conscription matters, it is generally planned to recruit volunteers first. The relevant bureaus will discuss detailed measures within days. However, according to the conscription results of each district in the city last year, the implementation was fraught with difficulties and failed to achieve the expected goals. The quantity of grain required for each eligible adult male also caused repeated disputes, and almost half of them have been delayed in payment until now.

### Minister of Economic Affairs Hosts Business and Industry Leaders; Listens to Opinions as Policy-Making Reference; Barter Trade Between North and South Should Adopt Comprehensive Method; Unworkable Laws to Be Abolished

[Our Newspaper] Minister of Economic Affairs Sun Yueqi hosted leaders from various sectors of business and industry in this city at the Textile Association yesterday at 4:00 PM to listen to their opinions, as a reference for policy-making. The tea party took place in a harmonious atmosphere and concluded around 7:00 PM.

At the beginning of the reception, Minister Sun stood up and gave a speech, stating: "Since the government announced my appointment as Minister of Economic Affairs, I have been waiting for the ministry's organizational structure to be determined, so I have only now been able to come to Shanghai. I would like to take this opportunity to ask for your insights on industry, commerce, and the economy. If there is anything the government can do to help, it will do its best. Likewise, if you have the ability to assist the government, please provide guidance. In recent years, the economy and finance have failed to coordinate, so I hope that in the future, the economy, finance, and labor can all coordinate and understand each other. Under the current circumstances, I will do as much as I can, and I hope to alleviate the suffering of all industries as much as possible. I plan to establish a private industry advisory committee within the Ministry of Economic Affairs, inviting leaders from various sectors of business and industry to participate, so that I can solicit your opinions on many policies and implement them if they are feasible. I now invite you to express your valuable opinions."

Subsequently, Liu Hongsheng, Xu Jilong, Wang Xiaolai, Luo Qinghua, Jin Runxiang, Liu Guangyi, Pan Shihao, Xie Tiansha, Tian Heqing, Wang Xianqing, Liu Jingji, and Shou Jingwei, among others, expressed their opinions on the suffering of various industries and requested Minister Sun to find solutions.

Fuel Coal Supply Problem Can Be Temporarily Resolved

Finally, Minister Sun summarized the points and reached the following conclusions: (1) The loan for the silk reeling industry is extremely urgent. If it is delayed, it will be impossible to save the industry after the silkworms emerge as moths. For this matter, the silk reeling industry should first propose a concrete proposal and convene leaders of the industry for a meeting at 10:00 AM tomorrow (the 21st) at the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs on the fourth floor of the Astor House Hotel, presided over by Deputy Minister Jian Guansan, to discuss solutions. (2) Regarding tea loans, it is hoped that tea industry leaders will propose feasible solutions and discuss them with Deputy Minister Jian Guansan at the same location at 3:00 PM tomorrow (the 21st). (3) Coal Supply: Since November of last year, I have been in charge of the Coal Regulation Committee and have been serving others. I will not engage in buying and selling myself. After becoming Minister of Economic Affairs, I will continue to do things in the same spirit. The coal problem can now be temporarily resolved, as 50,000 tons of medicinal coal have been negotiated. For those who use their own foreign exchange to purchase coal, approval has been granted to open it up as much as possible, and it has been requested to exempt import duties on fuel coal for two months.

Different Views Exist on the Abolition of Limits on Yarn and Cloth Transport to the South

(4) Regarding the issue of limits on yarn and cloth transport to the South, the cotton spinning and dyeing industries in this city strongly advocate abolishing them. However, while in Beijing, he received a telegram from Guangdong, forwarded by Acting President Li, stating that Guangdong had a surplus of yarn and cloth and needed to export it. Therefore, there were different views on whether to abolish them. At that time, he entrusted Zhang Zihe and others to study the matter, believing that the quota was originally set to prevent smuggling in Hong Kong. However, regarding this matter, it is still hoped to solicit the opinions of leaders in the industry. I do not want to act rashly. As long as everyone has a unified opinion and I can do it, I will do my best. (5) I have always advocated for trade between the North and South, as Shanghai is a manufacturing center and needs to obtain raw materials from abroad. However, I believe that barter trade between the North and South should adopt a comprehensive barter method, and not specify that a certain item must be bartered for a certain other item. (6) The Trademark Bureau is currently actively improving itself and plans to appoint Wu Chengluo as director. In the future, it will specially research ways to improve the process of searching trademarks.

Seeking the Interests of the Public; Serving the Enterprise

(7) Please provide more opinions on laws that are difficult to implement. After verification, a decision will be made to abolish them. For example, the Tungsten and Antimony Procurement Method of the National Resources Commission, which was passed by the Executive Yuan, has now been approved for cancellation by the Executive Yuan. Once it is passed by the Legislative Yuan, it can be formally abolished. (8) Regarding the issue raised by the import and export industry that the foreign exchange transfer rate is too far from the market price of the U.S. dollar, this matter is related to finance. In addition to economics and finance, today's matters often also have a military component, making the Minister of Economic Affairs seem insignificant. However, I will still do my best to solve the problem. (9) The raw materials needed by the steel industry, pig iron, must wait for barter trade with North China. There is a surplus of coking coal produced in Pingxiang, so it is necessary to find a way to increase the transportation volume of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which may solve part of the problem. (10) For all other issues, I still hope that all sectors will provide more guidance. I have no preconceived notions and will always take the interests of the public as my own and serve the enterprise.

### Two British Warships Attacked in Succession; Continued from Page Two

Chinese Report

[Reuters, Nanjing, 20th] According to a spokesperson for the Second Fleet Command of the Chinese Navy in Zhenjiang, the "Amethyst" was attacked by communist artillery fire between the port and Sanjiangying at 8:00 AM this morning. Soldiers of the 51st Army of the Nationalist Army on the south bank saw the ship being fired upon. The ship displayed the British flag. After being hit, it stopped and raised a white flag. The 51st Army mistakenly believed that the ship was a Chinese warship and immediately telegraphed the Zhenjiang headquarters for instructions on what action to take. However, the Second Fleet Command of the Chinese Navy informed the 51st Army that it was unaware of the "Amethyst" sailing upstream and that there were no Chinese warships nearby. Therefore, the 51st Army did not fire from the south bank to provide cover. After a while, the "Amethyst" weighed anchor and sailed upstream towards Nanjing, but the communist army on the north bank immediately opened fire again. The ship may have sunk.

British naval personnel here expressed doubt about the 51st Army's claim that they saw the "Amethyst" raise a white flag. They believe that the ship raised another white sign to prove its British identity. Before the "Consort" found the "Amethyst," a British Air Force plane that was responsible for delivering diplomatic documents between Nanjing and Hong Kong, as well as a Chinese Air Force reconnaissance plane, were dispatched to search. A Chinese naval gunboat was also dispatched, but none were found. Furthermore, although the "Consort" found the "Amethyst" had run aground, it has not yet been determined whether the ship ran aground due to being hit or to avoid artillery fire by maneuvering.

The British Embassy here clarified that the "Amethyst" was sailing to Nanjing to undertake the task of evacuating foreigners in Nanjing in the event that the Nationalists and Communists peace talks broke down.

Statement by British Navy in Shanghai

[Reuters, This City] The British naval authorities here issued the following statement regarding the incident of British warships being attacked on the Yangtze River today: The British warship "Consort," sailing downstream from Nanjing to assist the British warship "Amethyst," has arrived in Jiangyin, carrying several injured personnel. The British warship "Black Swan" has also arrived in Jiangyin and will provide medical assistance to the injured, as it has doctors and medical equipment specially brought from Shanghai. The British heavy cruiser "London" is expected to arrive in Jiangyin at 9:00 PM tonight. Vice Admiral Madden, Deputy Commander of the British Far East Fleet, is personally on board the "London." The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon but changed course after receiving the news. The "Amethyst" was attacked while transporting supplies needed by the British Embassy to Nanjing. The first ship to rush to the rescue was unable to provide assistance due to the artillery fire.

[Reuters, This City] A British naval spokesman here told our agency that, as of now, it cannot be officially confirmed whether the attack on British warships in the Yangtze River was the responsibility of the Chinese Communists or whether the shells were actually fired from the north bank of the Yangtze River. However, the spokesman confirmed that the British warship "Consort" did return fire in the direction from which the shells were fired. He also said that it is not yet known whether the "Amethyst" is still under attack. Furthermore, according to informed sources, the British Navy is attempting to contact the Chinese Communists to demand that they cease their attacks.

"Consort" Returned Fire

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 20th] According to foreign inspectors who inspected the Yangtze River by plane, the British destroyer "Consort" was bombarded by communist artillery positions, and the ship returned fire.

[Associated Press, London, 20th] The British Admiralty announced on the 20th that when the British warship "Amethyst" was attacked, it exchanged fire with coastal artillery batteries along the river.

[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] Foreign air observers today saw the British destroyer "Consort" engaged in a gun battle with communist shore batteries in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, 15 miles downstream from where the "Amethyst" ran aground. From the air, the "Amethyst" showed no signs of movement.

Number of Casualties on Both Ships

[Reuters, Nanjing, 20th] According to recently obtained unconfirmed reports, 20 sailors from the British warship "Amethyst" have been taken to the Zhenjiang Chinese naval hospital after being hit by communist artillery fire. Another 25 sailors on the British warship "Consort" were also injured. The Chinese military authorities in Zhenjiang have dispatched troops to escort the 60 British naval personnel on the "Amethyst" to a safe area. Furthermore, according to a telegram from Zhenjiang, 20 people died and 20 were seriously injured on the British warship "Amethyst" after being attacked. Another 65 people have been evacuated to Taipingzhou.

### Building a Great Wall of Flood Defense: The Haining Chenwengang Seawall Project

— Our Correspondent Huang Xingtan

[Report from our newspaper, Hangzhou, 17th] The car travels along the Qiantang River, deep into the wilderness. On both sides of the road, in the fields, lush vegetation thrives. Mulberry trees are growing tender, green new leaves. The withered stalks of perilla still remain in the ridges. Pea flowers bloom like butterflies on the slopes of the road. Yellow rape flowers spread their fragrance on the spring breeze. Villages are scattered, partially visible through the bamboo forests. Men wear straw hats, and women wear blue-patterned headscarves, all working diligently under the bright sunshine. This is truly the beautiful and simple countryside of Jiangnan. The Qiantang River is so serene, the water flowing silently, carrying countless sails forward without end, and occasionally splashing against the banks, creating crisp sounds, singing the beauty of the countryside. Ah, what a beautiful natural scene! But when the vast river refuses to be confined by its bed, the waves will surge into angry tides, crashing against the banks with overwhelming force, swallowing the land, houses, and lives on both sides. At that time, the wilderness becomes timid and trembling, and terror shrouds the land. Two years ago, the collapse of the riverbank in Nansha inundated 200,000 mu of land, with the tide invading more than ten li inland. Over 500 houses were swept away in Toupeng Town, and residents cried in despair facing the river. Last year, during the autumn tides, dozens of li of arable land in Ningxi and Yuanshou townships of Haining, as well as the Wengjiabu area, were washed away, along with 45 people and their homes and livelihoods. Over 230 households were affected by the disaster. This tragic history casts a large shadow over the millions of residents in the seven prefectures of Hang, Jia, Hu, Song, Su, Chang, and Tai in Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces, affecting their safety.

The Qiantang River Tide

While it attracts the curiosity of people across the country and even the world, it remains a great threat to the millions of people on both sides. Ever since the Tang and Song dynasties, tidal disasters have been endless. During the Qianlong era of the Qing dynasty, the national treasury was emptied to build seawalls. On the north bank, from Shangsi Township in Hang County to Jin Sinang Bridge in Pinghu, the seawall stretched 190 kilometers. On the south bank, from Linpu Town in Xiaoshan to Shangzhen Haoba Town, it stretched 118 kilometers. This was not only hailed in history as one of China's four great engineering projects but also ensured the safety of the people of Zhejiang for over a century. However, during the eight years of the War of Resistance, the seawalls were neglected and fell into disrepair. Although the Zhejiang Provincial Government established the Seawall Engineering Bureau in 1946, until the end of March of this year, when the bureau was closed and merged into the Water Conservancy Bureau, the bureau had been diligently working to replenish and repair the seawalls for two years and seven months, allowing them to weather the successive dangerous tides, and sparing the lives of people on both banks. But under the principle of addressing both the symptoms and the root causes, from protecting the banks to facilitating navigation, the Seawall Engineering Bureau has indeed brought more blessings to the people of Zhejiang. However, due to the fact that too much of the seawall was damaged "congenitally" and the difficulty in obtaining "acquired" funding, the seawall project could not be carried out as ideally planned. Some local gentry even suspected that the water diversion dam project of the Seawall Engineering Bureau was a waste of manpower and resources, and was useless. Some responsible officials also only acknowledged that the water diversion dam project above Haining was successful, and that building water diversion dams to control the river below Haining was not appropriate. For this reason, Chairman Zhou Yan specially invited engineering experts and relevant officials to discuss the urgent issue of controlling the Qiantang River. The focus of the debate was on water diversion dams. From an engineering point of view, water diversion dams are indeed an effective engineering method for controlling rivers in modern countries, but due to the difficulty of funding and the piecemeal construction, coupled with the changes in the flow of the Qiantang River and the turbulence of the tides, it is inevitable that the results have not been effective. Therefore, at present, we can only start with treating the symptoms, repairing the most important seawalls and repairing breaches, namely the Chenwengang slope seawall project and the Sibao water diversion dam bank protection project. When Haining was hit by disaster the year before last, the Seawall Engineering Bureau used firewood dams to fill the breach in Chenwengang, temporarily blocking the high tide. In the past two years, due to funding issues, only 500 meters of permanent concrete seawall have been built, and there is still a 1,604-meter breach. The Sibao water diversion dam has five sections. The Seawall Engineering Bureau has laid the foundation, but the tide is still directly impacting the dam body (the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway is built on the seawall). Therefore, the situation is very dangerous and it is necessary to rush to build a water diversion dam that extends 200 meters into the river, which requires throwing in more than 70,000 cubic meters of rock (equivalent to more than 100,000 tons). Only more than 10,000 cubic meters have been thrown in so far. Wang Huzhen, the former Deputy Director of the Seawall Engineering Bureau, once told reporters: "We engineers are like doctors, we can diagnose diseases and prescribe prescriptions, but what can we do without medicine!" The Qiantang River is Zhejiang's—one might even say Southeast China’s—rotten belly, needing a good diagnosis and treatment. Now, fortunately, this symptom-treating construction is being sponsored by the US aid fund from the Sino-American Cooperation Administration, and the Chenwengang and Sibao projects are being managed by the Engineering Office of the "Qiantang River Seawall Project US Aid Fund Supervision Committee." With the "medicine" problem solved, the project will be easier to carry out. In order to catch up with time and complete the seawall project before this year's autumn tide, the US Aid Engineering Office has decided to complete the five sections of the Sibao water diversion dam project by July 1 and the Chenwengang permanent concrete slope seawall project by the end of July. To supply the needs of the project, the Tangshan and Jianshan quarries are processing and mining rock; crushed stone from Jianshan is supplied to Chenwengang, and large rock from Tangshan is supplied to Sibao. The reporter has already reported in detail on the machine mining project in Fuyang Tangshan; the scale of the mining project in Jianshan now exceeds Tangshan. Not only is there more equipment in Jianshan than in Tangshan, including air compressors for drilling holes, generators, bulldozers, excavators, etc., but there are also six stone crushers, and a light railway has been built on the 12-kilometer distance between Jianshan and Chenwengang, with five small trains, each with twenty flatcars, which can transport 15 cubic meters, or 20 tons, of rock. From blasting the mountain to turning it into small crushed stone to loading it onto the train, all is done mechanically. Four hundred cubic meters of rock can be produced every day, of which five hundred cubic meters are crushed into gravel. In order to save time, the Jianshan quarry has been open since April 16th

Adding Night Shifts to Quarry

Jianshan is located between Haining and protrudes into Hangzhou Bay. It is only a half-hour car ride from Jianshan along the Hangzhou Bay coast to Chenwengang, Jiangbian, Dingqiao Town, Haining. Entering this large factory, which is 1,600 meters long and 250 meters wide, one becomes nervous because so many machines and workers are working so hard, doing their best to prepare for a great battle with the autumn floods! Manager Wu of the contractor, Guohua Company, told reporters: "This 1,600-meter-long cement concrete seawall requires 66,000 bags of cement, 20,000 cubic meters of gravel, 50,000 square stones, 5,100 six-inch-thick American pine board piles for the seawall foundation, 5,000 round water piles, and 60,000 round wood piles for the level. Excavating the earthwork alone requires 165,000 cubic meters. Just talking about driving piles, it would take a few days to dismantle so many incense sticks at Lingyin Temple. We have to complete the project in five months, how can we not step up our work!"

Not only is the work intense, but it is also the largest mechanized engineering project in Southeast China. All ditching, earth excavation, pushing, piling, pumping, and seawall construction are carried out by machines from beginning to end, but workers also cooperate with the machines to meet the needs of project progress. In this vast factory of more than 3,000 acres, there are more than 50 engineers, more than 200 technical workers, more than 4,000 male and female workers, cooperating with seven bulldozers, three trench excavators, five excavators, five pile drivers, eight cement mixers, five cranes, fourteen water pumps, more than one hundred light rail flatcars, and more than ten transport trucks… These four or five thousand horsepower machines combined with the labor of four or five thousand people form a

Great Collective Labor

Under the bright sunshine, accompanied by the sound of the river, the cranes go up and down, the bulldozers rumble, the trucks and light flatcars shuttle back and forth, and the four or five thousand workers hoeing the mud, carrying the loads, sweating and panting, the sounds of "hum, ha, ha" seem like the sound of the surging tide coming from afar, the groups of workers go up and down on the earth pits and mounds, the heads are crowded, like the rise and fall of the waves in the Qiantang River tide. In the thundering sound of the motors, in the flying ash and sand, every engineer, every worker, every machine, does its best to perform its task, cooperating into a great movement, in this movement, the flat ground becomes high ground in an instant, the mud hills become deep ditches, and huge wooden piles have penetrated deep into the ground. What a great power! Looking at such a scene, one cannot help but think of the story of building the Great Wall in ancient times, the scene must have been like this.

Yes, this great power is building a flood defense Great Wall, building a flood defense Great Wall for the more than 20 million people in the seven prefectures of Hang, Jia, Hu, Song, Su, Chang, and Tai. To adapt to this great project, 11 mobile wooden houses, workshops, engine rooms, material storage sheds, etc., have been built in the factory area; 5 kilometers of construction roads; 5 kilometers of light railways; 5 large and small generators, with a power generation capacity of 230 kilowatts, and 5 kilometers of power lines have been laid; more than 1,000 electric lights; 9 water listening stations, with 200 horsepower, and a water volume of more than 50 million gallons; a wireless 10-line switchboard, which can be used for communication throughout the factory area and the Chenwengang Dingqiao Town material transfer station; and a water transport terminal that can unload and transport 50,000 tons of materials. The more than 3,000 acres of the factory area is truly like a Qiantang River

Emerging Engineering City, proudly working in an environment of gunfire. When reporters visited, the earth excavation project had been completed by 40,000 cubic meters, and the equipment for driving base piles and board piles had also been arranged, and machine piling could be started from the 17th. If there are no special accidents, the entire project can be completed as scheduled.

Mao Yisheng, the former director of the Seawall Engineering Bureau, once said: "Controlling the Qiantang River is the greatest responsibility of the people of Zhejiang." But the people of Zhejiang have become so poor in the years of war. At present, the symptom-treating repair project (the Chenwengang and Sibao projects require more than one million US dollars) also relies on the strength of foreign aid; the fundamental treatment of the Qiantang River is obviously out of the question. However, when Mao Yisheng and Wang Huzhen were in charge of the Seawall Engineering Bureau, although the economic situation remained the same, they were very energetic in their work, from repairing the seawall and protecting the coast to trying to open up navigation on the Qiantang River. Now, the responsible authorities seem to lack this kind of vitality, which is a deep concern for the poor people of Zhejiang. Since the two largest symptom-treating projects have been undertaken by the US aid fund, and the Water Conservancy Bureau (Seawall Engineering Bureau) is only responsible for the design, it should devote its remaining efforts to more ambitious goals in the future. We look forward to the prosperity of Zhejiang, and therefore we must ask the responsible authorities not to forget Mao Yisheng's words: "Controlling the Qiantang River is the greatest responsibility of the people of Zhejiang." If a public servant can lead the people to complete this great task, he can be said to be great.

### The Betrayal of Zhang Xianzheng, Commander of the First Traffic Police Training Regiment

— Our Special Correspondent Huang Chao Ru

[Report from our newspaper, Changsha, 16th (Air Mail)] Zhang Xianzheng, the Commander of the First Traffic Police Training Regiment, mutinied in Zhuzhou on the 21st of last month, but the situation was quickly resolved. Zhang himself only managed to escape with a dozen or so men. On the first of this month, Zhang appeared in Zhugaotang, Shaoyang, and was captured by Chen Mingren's 29th Army in Xiaomen and escorted to Changsha. However, after interrogation, Zhang's so-called "mutiny" turned out to be a complete "misunderstanding." Below is Zhang's confession:

Zhang Xianzheng, a native of Huarong, Hunan,

Started as a private in the military and went through four school training sessions. He is a member of the Kuomintang. Last year, he was ordered by the Traffic Police Headquarters to establish two traffic police regiments in Hunan. Coincidentally, the Hunan Provincial Government had just issued an order to stop all National Army units from recruiting in Hunan. Zhang's recruitment work was therefore hindered. Later, after repeated explanations to Cheng Qian, directly and indirectly, he acknowledged that the troops would be established in Hunan and would be responsible for protecting their homes and villages in Hunan in the future, and would be directly under the command of the Pacification Headquarters. Only then did Cheng Qian agree. Afterwards, more than 8,000 people were recruited in various counties. At the same time, the Traffic Police Headquarters also approved the allocation of 960 carbines, 620 Thompson submachine guns, 20 heavy machine guns, 30 light machine guns, 100 rifles, and 34 revolvers. Just as he was preparing to collect them, the then-Director of the Headquarters, Wei Long, was detained, and he failed to collect them. At the same time, he was ordered by the Headquarters to go to Zhejiang to garrison. Zhang was appointed by the Headquarters, and the unit's designation was also Traffic Police, so he should obey the Headquarters' orders. He then contacted the Changsha Garrison Headquarters to collect "Royal Certificates" for collecting food anywhere during the march, but the Garrison Commander Liu Rouyuan refused to issue them because he had not received an order from the Pacification Headquarters. At this time, Cheng Qian had also gone to Nanjing, and it was impossible to negotiate. In this way, after many twists and turns, he still failed to comply with the order to set off. Later, Zhang sent Quartermaster Li Yunzhong and four others to collect food at the Headquarters' office in Hengyang. Presumably, the Headquarters' office suspected and was dissatisfied with Zhang's delay in complying with the order to set off. Not only did they not issue military food at that time, but they also detained Quartermaster Li. In this way, Zhang was in a dilemma, at a loss of what to do, and the entire

officers and soldiers were without food for a month. Under these circumstances, Zhang convened a meeting of all the officers and soldiers to discuss how to solve the current difficulties. At the meeting, no one had any suggestions. Finally, Xu Yulong, the Director of Personnel, came up with an idea. He said: "Today's matter is that if we don't set off, we will disobey the orders of the Headquarters, but if we set off, we will be letting down Commander Cheng. But our troops were approved by Commander Cheng, and our officers and soldiers are Hunan natives, so it's better not to set off." After Xu said this, they decided not to set off. When Cheng Qian returned to Changsha from Nanjing, Zhang immediately reported the decision not to set off and the difficult situation in person. Cheng Qian then issued an order on March 17: "The First Traffic Police Regiment of Zhang Xianzheng is approved to be reorganized into the Fifth Hunan Security Brigade. The Commander of the Regiment is hereby appointed as the Brigade Commander. It should be quickly organized into three regiments and given rations. This is to Chief of Staff Liu (Jiashu) to inform the Security Command to check and handle." Cheng also instructed Zhang in person to go to Liling to collect the firearms stored by the Traffic Police Headquarters in the warehouses there. Zhang obeyed the order and received 2,000 shi of grain and 1 million gold yuan from the Garrison Department on March 18. He got on the train early in the morning of the 19th to go to Liling. But after getting on the train, he thought about it, and Chairman Cheng had not issued a formal order, so how dare he rashly collect them? So he immediately got off the train again and rushed to the Provincial Government. At that time, Chairman Cheng had not yet gotten up, so he had to write

two notes, one to be presented to Chairman Cheng, and one to be handed to Secretary-General Deng Jiesong. The general idea was: I dare not take action regarding the gun matter in Liling because no order has been issued. If necessary, (I am afraid that the guns will be transported away first) I will take them first to replenish the army and report for record first.

At 9:00 AM, he returned to Changsha Railway Station and took the train again. When he arrived in Zhuzhou, he heard that the Headquarters had already loaded the guns from the warehouse onto the train, preparing to transport them to Zhejiang. Zhang immediately sent Major Regiment Adjutant Luo Jian to transport the 2,000 shi of grain and 1 million gold yuan to Chashi, Hengyang (the location of Zhang's troops). He himself took more than ten orderlies and rushed to Liling that night. The next morning, he investigated and found that the guns had indeed been loaded onto the train. He then ordered the station to open the carriages to Zhuzhou on the same day. After arriving in Zhuzhou (21st), he reported to Chief of Staff Liu of the Changsha Pacification Headquarters by telephone. Liu asked where the guns were now. Zhang replied that they had been transported to Zhuzhou. Liu then instructed him to transport them to Changsha immediately. He also said that Chief Tan (Chief of the Second Division of the Pacification Headquarters) had been sent to receive them. He also said that the Pacification Headquarters would be responsible for this matter, and you cannot be responsible. Zhang then waited for Tan in Zhuzhou. He did not see Chief Tan until 9:00 PM, but Cao Tieshen, the Director of the Headquarters' Hengyang Office, arrived. Zhang received a report from an orderly that Cao had brought many people. Fearing that Cao would be detrimental to him, he took an orderly to the Fuxing Bank, which was four li away from the station, to report to Deputy Commander Liu of the 29th Army. Liu was not there. As soon as he turned to leave, the streets were under curfew and no one was allowed to pass. Zhang also fell into the people's home at this time. On the 22nd, he hired a boat to Xiangtan for a price of two silver dollars. Zhang's Second Company was stationed in Xiangtan. Zhang went to the company headquarters, and instructed Company Commander Zhang Kai to publish an announcement in the newspaper

declaring his attitude. At the same time, he found Huang Zihua, the Commander of the 23rd Division, to discuss the matter. At this time, Zhang originally intended to go directly to Changsha to see the Chairman, but Commander Huang said that everyone outside was already saying that you had mutinied; at the same time, the other party was dissatisfied with your actions. You probably wouldn't be caught before you reached Changsha. It's better to ask someone to mediate first.

Zhang stayed in Xiangtan for several days and could not think of a good solution. Coincidentally, the Xiangtan newspaper reported that Hui Jian, the Chief of the First Division of the Pacification Headquarters, had gone to Dongkou to discuss Li Jingyi's way out. Because Hui and Zhang were classmates, he decided to go to Dongkou to find Hui and tell him about the incident. On the 30th, he took a car to Shaoyang. On the 31st, he arrived at Zhugaotang. Because Li Jingyi was in Shanmen, he hired a sedan to go to Shanmen. On the way, he was interrogated and captured by the 29th Army and escorted to Changsha.

Zhang is now being held in the Security Command. His confession is quite similar. On the 11th, the Ministry of National Defense sent a telegram to the Pacification Headquarters, requesting that he be severely punished.

### Proposed Construction of Public Toilets on Qipulu and Rehe Road: Nearby Residents Urge Authorities to Strictly Ban

To the Editor of the Shenbao Social Service Column: We are a group of small citizens living in the Qipulu and Rehe Road area. Recently, someone wanted to build a "public toilet" at the corner of those two roads. It is said that they have already obtained permission from the police authorities (?), and have already surrounded the area with fences (even enclosing the street sign standing there!). It seems that construction is about to begin. We have no way of knowing the purpose of this "public toilet." Saying that it is for the convenience of the public, but there is already a public toilet at the end of nearby Haining Road, and there is really no need to build another one. Even if you want to build one, it should not be built in such a busy traffic area. Because the road there is already narrow, if you add a building, it will inevitably hinder traffic. Moreover, the vegetable market is nearby, and if you build a "public toilet" there, flies and maggots will breed in the future, spreading epidemics, and the consequences are unimaginable. I think that person must be doing this for profit, ignoring public health and public transportation. I think the wise health and police authorities will not allow him to be so bold and reckless. We have always admired your newspaper's enthusiasm for public welfare, and we dare to ask you to expose this in your column, so as to attract the attention of the health and police authorities and ban it. Then you will be doing a great service to the small people and it will be a work of great merit. Respectfully wishing you good writing, a group of small citizens respectfully presented, April 16.

### Silk Prices Still Rising Consistently

Yesterday morning, the opening price for top-grade raw silk was advertised as high as 80 million yuan. Subsequently, KY23 bales were traded at 78 million yuan, which was 9 million yuan higher than the previous market price.

Yesterday, the initial asking price for rayon from the Zhongtian Bridge and Sylvania brands for immediate delivery was 38.5 million yuan. The afternoon closing price was 36.5 million yuan. Today, the opening price for futures transactions was 46 million yuan, and the closing price rose to 47.4 million yuan. Although the market trend was affected by tightening credit, confidence remained strong and buying interest was still high, up 4.4 million yuan from the previous afternoon's closing price.

Yesterday's silk fabric prices at Huaqiang rose to the limit. The initial opening price increased by the prescribed 20% limit, closing at 23.3 million yuan. After the market closed, over-the-counter trading initially saw prices at 28 million yuan, once rising as high as 29 million yuan, but finally dropping to 27 million yuan at the afternoon close. This was an increase of 1.5 million yuan compared to the previous afternoon's close. Other fabrics saw little fluctuation.

### Legal Clarifications · Answered by Attorney Jiang Pingfan ·

[Answer to Mr. Wang Jingjiu]

According to the law, a sub-landlord cannot collect a transfer fee from a third-party tenant, but in reality, this kind of bad habit does exist in this city.

[Answer to Mr. Hu Shiying]

(1) Whether inheritance tax should be paid depends on whether the deceased has an estate. If C indeed has no estate, there is no need to pay inheritance tax according to the law. (2) You can report the actual situation to the tax bureau and explain that C did not have any estate.

[Answer to Mr. Hua Xingzhi]

(1) Since I am an adult, parents are not criminally liable for my illegal acts outside the home. (2) You can publish a statement in the newspaper stating that I am personally responsible for all credit and debt relationships and that my parents are not involved.

Answered by Attorney Tang Mingshi

[Answer to Mr. Shihe] (1) If one of the parties to an engagement has been missing and their life or death is unknown for more than one year, the other party may dissolve the engagement, which is in accordance with Article 976, Paragraph 3 of the Civil Code. However, the problem lies in the proof of "missing and life or death unknown." (2) Dissolution always requires going through procedures, regardless of the reason. (3) Before the engagement is dissolved, it is not permissible to enter into another engagement with a third party. (4) If a minor's engagement is entered into on their behalf by their parents, and they do not agree to it, they must express this in a timely manner upon reaching adulthood; it is not invalid simply because it is not subsequently ratified.

### Silver Dollar Vendor Does Not Take Unrighteous Gains: Wang Xuecheng Returns Pearl to Hepu

Editor: I, the undersigned, purchased several silver dollars from someone near Xinghua Restaurant on Fuzhou Road on the 12th of this month. After paying, I lost contact due to the crowded crowd and did not receive the silver dollars. Unexpectedly, on the 15th, I learned that your newspaper arrived at Mr. Zhang Zhiyi's Yi Tai Xiang ivory store at No. 298 Fuzhou Road, and I retrieved the full amount. In this declining world with cunning and deceitful people, to find someone who does not pocket money found is truly rare. It is evidence of Mr. Zhang's loyalty and integrity, which is commendable. I have attached a silver dollar to donate to your organization's fund for helping the needy in Mr. Zhang's name, and I request that it be published in your column to encourage the prevailing customs. Respectfully addressed to the Social Services Column, by Wang Xuecheng, April 17th.

### Wuxi County Government Secretary Feng Puren Assaults Person While Watching Play

Theater Industry Reports the True Picture

[Wuxi, 18th] Feng Puren, chief secretary and social section chief of the county government, and five others went to the Queen's Theater to watch a play on the afternoon of the 17th. Because the seats were full and the show had been running for a long time, the doorman did not open the door in order to maintain order, which aroused dissatisfaction from Feng and others, leading to a full-scale brawl in which they beat the doorman. They also strung up the theater's general affairs manager, Ding Heling, when he went to the county to explain and apologize, and arrested the doorman, tied him up again, and beat him, causing a huge uproar. The community is calling for justice. The theater industry association and entertainment venues and other professional unions held a reception at the Duoyi Building for all sectors of society to report the truth, attended by Speaker Li of the Council, Supervisor Wang of the City Defense Department, Director Miao of the Police Bureau, representatives from various newspapers, and more than 300 representatives from French companies. They resolved to demand strict punishment for Feng Puren and others.

It is learned that the Wuxi Theater Industry Association has telegraphed Liang Qitian, chairman of the National Theater Industry Association, to demand that he uphold justice and provide unified assistance.

### Four Types of Old Foreign Currency Debt About to be Replaced with New Public Bonds

Regarding the government's old foreign currency bonds being replaced with new public bonds, our Central News Agency reporter visited the relevant department of the Ministry of Finance, who informed us that the four types of foreign currency bonds, namely the 1938 Gold Bond English-American Gold Bonds, the 1940 Construction Gold Bond Phase I English-American Gold Bonds, the 1942 Allied Victory US Dollar Bonds, and the 1947 Short-Term (US Dollar) Treasury Bills, that remain outstanding, were originally scheduled to be replaced with Gold Yuan Public Bonds when the currency system was reformed last year. However, after the amended Gold Yuan Coupon regulations were promulgated, the statutory exchange rate of the Gold Yuan Coupon against foreign currencies changed. In order to enhance creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance formulated a plan in January of this year to replace the above four types of old foreign currency bonds with the 1949 Reorganization US Dollar Public Bonds. The draft regulations for the Reorganization US Dollar Public Bonds have also been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. Once the review is passed and promulgated, and the bond certificates are printed, the procedures and deadlines for the exchange will be set, and the managing banks in various regions will be notified to handle the matter. As for the holders who have already registered with the handling banks to exchange for Gold Yuan Public Bonds and the 1948 Reorganization Public Bonds in accordance with the original plan, the temporary receipts they hold will be recalculated and exchanged for the 1949 Reorganization US Dollar Public Bonds at that time. Those who have not registered can exchange their original bonds for the 1949 Reorganization US Dollar Public Bonds in the future. The Ministry of Finance has already issued a public notice about this.

### Buying Interest Far Less Than Last Week, Hua Stocks Unable to Rise

Not reduced, the black market interest rate is above 150 yuan per thousand, but the insiders are still relatively firm, and there are very few sales from buyers. Most retail investors trade in a "scalping" manner, and sell off as soon as they make a profit.

At the opening of individual stocks, except for Taiwan Sugar, which is about to turn red, none of the others reached the limit price. Later, Chenghua Paint and Commercial Press also climbed to the price limit. Yongsha opened at 130 yuan, and sellers poured out, and the market fell. The lowest price was 121 yuan, and new buyers took delivery at the low price. The off-market gold price also reported an increase. The market price reached a high of 143 yuan, and the interest rate opened at a high of 155 yuan and 165 yuan. Retail investors could not bear the high interest burden, and they poured out one after another, falling back to close at 137 yuan. Meiya opened at 3.4 yuan, the lowest was 3.0 yuan, and closed at 3.3 yuan. Other stocks, except for a limited number such as Taiwan Sugar, saw a slight increase.

Market outlook: The evening news had more stimulating news. It was heard that the central bank did not sell gold and the money supply was tight. The counter price will turn to higher. Shortly after, the long-term market was settled for a long time, and Lin shatters the rumor of bankers getting ready to sell. The sudden drop was swift and violent. Yongsha traded at the price limit of 159 yuan, which was its new high price, and finally closed at 130 yuan, with an increase or decrease of 27 yuan. Most other stocks were stable and increased to the price limit.

### Foreign Stocks See New Highs Again

In the foreign stock market, the insiders were more willing to take delivery and saw a new high.

Due to the dark clouds of peace talks looming over the Chinese stock market, it was difficult to see an upward trend. However, the buying interest was not as strong as last week. Because the situation in Jiangbei is becoming increasingly tense, and the money supply is tight, steel and steel industries are breaking even. Asian Shipping entered at 35,000 yuan and exited at 37,000 yuan. Huade again saw a flying price, with a one-sided purchase of 1.55 million yuan, an increase of 450,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Market Stroll

— Spectator

Factory Prices Lead General Market Prices - Salary System Should Be Improved

The overall situation is ominous, and it has been blatantly reflected in the market.

Yesterday's morning and afternoon were like two different worlds. In the afternoon, the strength of the strength exceeded the strength of the rush.

Gold is now one code, and silver dollars have only increased in interest. Citibank is still relatively inferior. The most dangerous thing is the Five Oceans market. Cigarettes, soap, and matches were originally behind the factory prices, and the mobile cigarette counters were all raising prices at the snuff boss. Yesterday, the market prices caught up with the factory prices. If the market price is a rabbit, then the factory price must be like a tortoise competing with the rabbit, and will continue to work hard.

Market prices reflect sales

Factory prices reflect the boss's heart.

The boss must earn enough to win or lose every time he pays wages.

If you don't believe it, please check the factory price columns in the newspapers on the 3rd and 17th of each month, and compare them with the market price columns on that day, and you will see it clearly.

Factory prices can actually be greater than market prices, which is only possible in Chinese society.

Changing the wage salary to silver dollars has been agreed by the authorities.

The index is published once a week, which is necessary.

If wages and salaries are also paid once a week; it is really more disadvantageous to the employee class than paying once every half a month.

Because the more times salaries are paid, the greater the degree of fragmentation. The wages received are not even enough to buy a load of coal balls. Isn't this kind of wage increasing the suffering of employees? However, paying wages every week will create this situation.

However, in the current situation, the method of paying wages every half a month is really not feasible. Because the employees suffer too much. The phenomena in the salary payments in the past few periods are iron proof. To solve the salary payment method fairly, there are really only two methods:

(1) Change to paying silver dollars uniformly according to the pre-war standard.

(2) Prepay one month's salary according to the index of each period, and make up the difference when due.

Changing to paying silver dollars uniformly according to the pre-war standard is fair and reasonable. The prerequisite is that the Central Bank must bear the responsibility of fully supplying silver dollars, which is absolutely impossible.

Prepaying for one month is more reasonable. Because in the past, wages were paid according to the index, using the average price index of the past, but the price on the salary payment date was the highest price of the past, and the employees had already suffered a great loss. Moreover, when using the wages, the price is still rising, so when comparing the index at the time of receiving wages with the price at the time of using wages, it is the lowest index, and the employees suffer even more.

In short, the past index-based salary payment method itself has made each employee suffer two obvious losses.

Finance Minister Liu Gongyun has the intention of resigning, but it is actually unnecessary.

"The situation creates heroes". At this time, the economic situation is so chaotic, Feng Liu's familiarity with market skills can do a lot for the country. In the past, Liu made mistakes and was criticized by all parties. Frankly speaking, it was because Liu's policy had no fixed principles. Former Finance Minister Xu Kan had great ability, but he was also troubled by the same mistake.

For example, take an example: Before paying wages, the Central Bank often suppresses the market price of gold - in fact, at this time, manufacturers want to raise the price of goods and cash out inventory to adjust funds. Therefore, which boss does not hate the Central Bank to the extreme.

Controlling the market, without knowing how to use social policies to protect the interests of workers and citizens, and without knowing how to use the principles of capitalism to protect the interests of the bourgeoisie, then he will not gain public opinion, and it is his own fault.

If Liu can grasp these relative principles, with his experience in controlling the market, it is not impossible to achieve something.

Liu, think again!

Finance Minister Liu's policy lacks principles - With his ability, he can do a lot

### Tight Money, High Black Market Interest, Sluggish Rice Buying, Oil Market Hovering Down, Miscellaneous Grains Weak and Falling

The rice market rose slightly yesterday, but due to tight money and high black market interest, there were more sellers than buyers. Although each commodity rose by more than 100,000 yuan compared to yesterday, it was still not enough to offset the interest consumed, so it was a clear rise but a hidden weakness. The price of Beishi white japonica rice was 1.47 million yuan, an increase of 170,000 yuan. The price of early thin rice rose by about 150,000 yuan. The price of Nanshi white japonica rice was 1.45 million yuan, and the price of thin rice was 1.5 million yuan. At this price, it will not be sold out in the future. The price of the spot rice today is 1.6 million yuan for white japonica rice and 1.56 million yuan for early rice. The total amount of goods arriving in the two cities is 4,974 stone.

The edible oil market trend hovered down. Due to tight money, retail investors are all watching and not buying. The owners of the goods are selling their shares, and the sales channels are very dull. The highest price of raw vegetable oil was 7.1 million, and the closing price was 6.7 million. The closing price of soybean oil was 7.8 million yuan, a decrease of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. The price of Ji barrel raw oil was 7.2 million yuan, a decrease of 400,000 yuan. Soybean cake was weak and then firm.

The flour market trend hovered. From the opening to the closing, the price remained hovering at a firm level. The old car opened at 540,000 in the morning, the highest was 556,000, and the closing price returned to 550,000. The sales of bingchuan passengers were extremely high, and it once returned to 530,000. With tight money, the downstream was rebuilt and opened at 520,000. The wheat bran failed to catch up with the flour market's rise in the previous days, and it was raised by another 10% yesterday. The large package opened at 460,000 yuan and climbed to a peak of 475,000 yuan at the close.

The miscellaneous grains market was weak and fell due to tight money. However, the kernels for yellow beans were absorbed by the guest helper, and the market prices all rose. Winter beans were 1.4 million, the highest was 1.6 million. The kernels rose by 10%, the corn was flat and then weak, the red miscellaneous was stable, and the sesame trading became active.

### Yarn Market Clearly Firm and Weak in Hidden Ways, Cotton Cloth Market Rebounds Later

The yarn market was clearly firm and weak in hidden ways yesterday. The reason is that the market dismantling rate is high. The households holding goods saw the difficulty in dismantling and borrowing, and the intention to sell was very strong. Only the South China side of the guest helper slightly absorbed, and the insiders searched and purchased smoothly. As a result, although the prices of each yarn rose by 10%, they still could not maintain the interest rate.

The initial price of 42-count blue phoenix was 92 million, and finally retreated to 88 million, an increase of 8 million compared to the previous price. The price of 32-count silver moon went from 61 million to 59 million, and ended, with a final increase of 6 million.

The 21-count Double Horse initially opened at 51 million, once looked pretty at 51.5 million in the middle, and was forced back into the pass at noon, at 49.5 million, with a squeeze increase of 6.5 million. The 20-count Double Horse was 46 million, with a slight increase of 2 million. The other Tiannv and Red Kui Xing all buckled into the 5 million mark, and the other yarns also started to increase by more than 10%. The cotton cloth market was sluggish in the previous market, because the money supply was too tight, and those who held the goods were oppressed by high-interest lenders, and they were not willing to defend. Moreover, the sales to customers were not fast, and affected by the current situation, all parties had no intention of absorbing a large amount. In the afternoon, the money supply loosened slightly, and confidence fluctuated. The rising wind rekindled, and all the cloths created new highs again.

The initial opening price of the leading fine parts was 1.54 million in the morning. Then, it was heard that the market dismantling rate was as high as 3 yuan, and retail investors still cut prices to seek sales. The lowest level was 1.43 million. Near noon, many shorts covered their positions, and the price rose again to 1.51 million at noon, a decrease of 110,000 compared to the next-day evening closing price. The market then buckled into the 2 million opening price, which was 1.95 million.

The four gentlemen's serge opened at 1.5 million, and then fell to 1.41 million, and finally closed at 1.46 million, a decrease of 130,000. In the afternoon, it was raised to 1.92 million, and other cloths frequently created unprecedented new highs. The 1.9 million high-end Shilin has exceeded the 4 million mark.

### Da Gong Barely Wins Against McLeans; Only Three Remain; Basketball Arena's Popularity Explodes; Competing to See the Three-Man Finale

[Report by the News Office] The Da Gong versus McLeans Chinese-Western basketball exhibition game, organized by the city's Sports Reporters Association, was held at the City Gymnasium at 7:15 last night. The Da Gong team, having just returned from an overseas expedition, had been away from Shanghai fans for several months. McLeans, on the other hand, had been playing increasingly hard in the league, showing excellent recent form. Over three thousand spectators, drawn by their reputation, attended last night. Da Gong won with a score of 45 to 35. In the first half, both teams held their ground, with Da Gong leading by six points at 20 to 14.

Before the main game, there were two friendly matches, one for women and one for men. In the women's match, the Elegant team defeated the Strength team, 32 to 24. In the men's match, Da Tong defeated John, 29 to 24. The women's exhibition was relaxed, while the two university powerhouses in the men's match were in a constant state of fierce competition.

Last night, the Da Gong team performed exceptionally well. Cai Wenhua showed clear thinking, Huang Bailing contributed the most points, Cai Zhongqi displayed the vigor of a flying general, Zhan Chen charged like a rabbit, Tu Wenlong showed unparalleled bravery, and Ye Yunshan also put in a considerable effort. However, at times, the team seemed to lack "qi" (energy). It is said that Cai Lianke has decided to leave Da Gong, which explains his absence. McLeans' movements were extremely fast, with Hua Erxu, Laimushan, and Kaixiong putting on particularly outstanding performances.

Da Gong's starting five were Cai Zhongqi, Cai Wenhua, Zhan Chen, Tu Wenlong, and Ye Yunshan. The game started at 7:25. Ye and Tu committed fouls one after the other, and Laimushan and Kaixiong each scored one point, tying the game at 2-2. Wenhua's swiftness, and a successful free throw, allowed Da Gong to breathe a sigh of relief. Zhongqi was thoughtful and meticulous, Zhan Chen waited patiently for opportunities, and the ferocity of old Tu and the willingness of Yunshan to run were still not apparent, which shows how "good" and "intense" the McLeans performance was. A successful two-point free throw by the foreign player Laimushan, followed by two strong throws by Zhan and Cai, made it 7-5. Huang Bailing replaced Zhongqi, and the opponent's strongman Hua Erxu pulled it back to a tie at 7 with a three-pointer. Wenhua pushed in a shot, and Kaixiong created another tie. Yunshan scored, and McLeans made three substitutions in a row, but the result was not as good as before. Da Gong played steadily, accumulating points "little by little." When the score was 15-10, Wenlong had already committed four fouls, and Zhongqi re-entered the game. Wenhua's skillful coordination and a successful free throw by Bailing at the end of the first half made the score 20-14, with McLeans trailing by six points.

Resuming after the break, Zhan Chen easily scored a basket with Wenhua's assistance. Zhongqi's decisiveness and speed, along with Bailing's consecutive scores, helped. McLeans' Hua Erxu, Kaixiong, and Laimushan, the three musketeers, were still unconvinced, but Da Gong's Zhan Chen and Bailing continued to score, maintaining the lead. At 33-27, Tu replaced Wenhua, and McLeans' strongman committed his fifth foul and had to leave the court, further weakening their team. At 36-27, Zhongqi also committed his fifth foul and was replaced by Zhang Gensheng. McLeans' defense was weak, and they seemed on the verge of collapse. Gensheng's passes were perfectly timed, and Bailing scored effortlessly. Zhan was then dismissed with his fifth foul and replaced by Wang Cunzhong. Wang missed a shot and was sent off. Wenhua re-entered the game. In the last minute, both Tu and Ye committed their fifth fouls. Da Gong had no more players to substitute, and had to play five against three. McLeans also had five players foul out. In the end, Da Gong won against McLeans 45-35, by ten points.

### Da Tong Defeats John

In the men's friendly match between John and Da Tong, the two university powerhouses each displayed their own unique skills. Gathering the essence of strong teams from around Shanghai, this match could be described as "extraordinary" and worthy of attention. After the tip-off, Da Tong's Li Hanting scored first. John's Sun Moses retaliated, and the score was tied repeatedly at 2-2, 4-4, and 6-6. Li Hanting made a free throw to make it 7-6, and Xu Zhongyi scored a basket to make it 9-7. Le Jiazhou, being small in stature, had good ball sense, making it 15-11. John's Hu Huizhao replaced Zhuang Yirong. Soon after, Wang Gongsen replaced Tao Yingshi. Mo made it 14-14, and then tied the game at 16-16. Guozheng made a free throw, allowing them to lead by one point at 17-16 at halftime.

At the start of the second half, John's ball god was not working, and many shots under the basket were missed, much to the disappointment of the audience. Star player Sun Guozheng also showed signs of fatigue, missing two free throws. The score gradually fell behind to 23-20. Jiazhou committed his fifth foul, wearing an embarrassed expression. In the last three minutes, John's Guozheng and Moses showed their strength, twice managing to "pull back" a pair of points, making it very intense. Da Tong eventually won against John 29-24.

### Ping Pong Knowledge

— Authored by Wang Xinjing, Edited by Chen Linsheng

Therefore, when we return the same incoming ball, we can get various different results, because of the different angles of the ball and the paddle, and the height of the ball hit also differs.

The trajectory of the ball is parabolic. When we use a paddle at the same angle to hit the ball, the height of the ball hit will vary depending on whether the ball hits the paddle closer to or farther away from the body.

The above explains that the height of the ball is distinguished by the angle between the ball and the paddle when it hits. If we want to take the ball as the subject, we can also know that the reason for the height of the ball is distinguished by—the point where the ball receives force—. If we use the paddle to hit the nearest point of the incoming ball, then the force received by the ball is uniform in all parts, and the direction of advance is almost the same as the direction of force and straight; hitting the lower part of the ball, then the force received by the bottom of the ball is greater, and it will inevitably tend upwards.

In summary, to control height, one should observe the trend of the incoming ball, one's own standing position, and see what is convenient at the time. And vary the method of control.

Regarding the control of direction

The correctness of the ball hit depends not only on controlling the height, but also on having a good grasp of the direction of the ball hit. This kind of direction control is distinguished by: 1. the direction of the arm swing; 2. the bias of the paddle; 3. the point of force.

Direction of arm swing

With the swing of the arm, "force" will occur. The direction of the arm swing is where the "force" goes. The ball also goes in the straight direction of the "force." If the arm swing moves straight forward, the direction of the ball is also straight; swinging to the side can hit the ball into a diagonal line. Therefore, the direction of the ball is the direction of the arm swing.

Bias of the paddle

Whether the paddle is forward or flat can control the height of the ball; the bias of the paddle can control the direction of the ball. If the paddle is biased to the left when hitting the ball, the direction of the ball will also be to the left. Sometimes the swing of the arm is to the right, but when close to the ball, slightly bias the paddle to the left, and the direction of the ball will definitely change.

Point of Force

The point of force on the surface of the ball has an upper and lower distinction, and the hit ball will be high or low. Even if the point of force on the ball is biased to the left or right, it will affect the direction of the ball. Hitting the left part of the ball, the right half of the ball will receive less force and tend to the right. Hitting the right side of the ball, the result is a tendency to the left. However, using this method to control the direction, because the force on each part of the ball is uneven, and self-rotation occurs, the degree of directional bias is also difficult to grasp.

In summary, this kind of directional control is nothing more than two types: straight lines and diagonal lines.

Diagonal Line Practice Method

If the ball hit by the opponent is a diagonal line, then hitting the front of the ball will return the ball to its original place. If the incoming ball is a straight line, just identify the target and tilt the paddle slightly to the left or right, and the hit ball will also be a diagonal line.

The more this basic action is practiced, the better. At the same time, one should pay attention to the landing point of the ball sent by the opponent, the strength of the ball, and the height of the bounce. What angle should one use to return the ball? How much should the paddle be biased? If the angle of the paddle is too small, it is often easy to die in the net; if the angle is too large, and the force used when hitting is too strong, it is easy to go off the table. If the angle is large and the force is small, the ball's momentum is weak and high, giving the opponent an excellent opportunity to smash. As for the paddle being biased too severely, it will hit the ball to the side.

Some people often only see the opponent's arm movements and seek methods to return the ball. Usually, this method is not considered wrong, but when encountering an experienced opponent with skilled hitting techniques, it is easy to be deceived. For example, if the opponent's arm moves straight forward, one might guess that its path should also be straight. However, the opponent, at the moment of hitting the ball, slightly biases the paddle, which can change the direction of the ball. At this time, one's own posture to prepare to return the ball is completely ineffective and it becomes impossible to cope with the current incoming ball.

Straight Line Practice Method

The back and forth of the ball is very fast, and we should have the ability to make decisive decisions. Because the ball's coming and going is fleeting, hesitating even a little will lead to mistakes.

Straight line practice involves hitting from one's right side to the opposite left side, or from the left side to the opposite right side. The direction of the ball is a straight line. If the opponent's incoming ball is a diagonal line, then returning the ball in a straight line is relatively difficult, especially on the side that does not hold the paddle. However, to achieve victory and defeat the enemy, by taking advantage of the opponent's lack of preparation, it is easy to achieve results.

To return the opponent's diagonally moving ball, the paddle must be slightly tilted. As for how much to tilt, it is difficult to say. First, one must know the angle and landing point of the incoming ball; second, one must understand the strength of the ball and the possible extent of the ball's movement. Only then can one devise a method to cope with it.

These diagonal and straight line methods should be paid close attention to when first learning, because they will be very beneficial in various hitting techniques in the future.

### Kyushu Huarong Meet Their Match; Each Scores One Goal; Unable to Determine the Winner

The Minzhu Cup football match between Kyushu and Huarong was held in the southern city yesterday. After 90 minutes of intense play, the score was tied at 1-1. It can be said that they were evenly matched. Huarong kicked off first and was quite aggressive. About ten minutes into the game, Chen Yuwei scored a goal, but it was disallowed because Chen Lianglian was offside. Huarong persisted, and after 30 minutes, Chen Lianglian passed the ball to the right, and Shang Shiqi ran forward and kicked it. The ball went into the goal through the left corner, a very beautiful shot. Kyushu was not discouraged at all and immediately launched an offensive. Before three minutes had passed, Qiang Yuanzhi shot from afar, and the ball bounced into the goal after touching the legs of both Chen Keming and Xu Guoping, tying the score at 1-1. The competition became even more intense in the second half, and both sides put on extremely spectacular performances. Huarong's front line moved quickly, and the cooperation between Kyushu's Luo Shoufu and Jin Lusheng was particularly seamless, drawing continuous cheers from the audience. However, the defense lines of both teams, anchored by Meng Yiliang and Wu Qi, stood their ground, proving very solid, so the forwards could not break through the final barrier. As a result, they still parted on amicable terms with the score tied at 1-1.

Huarong

Chen Huimin, Lu Qitang, Le Dequan, Jiang Lei, Wu Qixiang, Gu Erlu, Zhu Jiaheng, Chen Yuwei, Chen Lianglian, Qian Yunqing, Shang Shiqi, Guan Yongchang

### Tonight's First Division Table Tennis Match; Powerhouse Huamei vs. Choubai

The 4th Table Tennis League continues tonight with one First Division match and five Second Division matches. The First Division match, Huamei versus Choubai, will be held at the Chouye Stadium. Huamei, the runner-up of the previous season, possesses veterans such as Xue Xuchu, the All-China Games table tennis runner-up, as well as Li Zongpei and Mu Hanjun. They have a strong lineup and impressive momentum. The team was originally scheduled to play against Quanlu in the opening match, but it was cancelled due to excessive crowding of the audience, which shows their strong drawing power. Tonight will be their first appearance. The above three players have exquisite skills and are sure to win. In this match, they will use new blood Xue Weichu and defensive chopper Wang Jiuqing to test their skills. Choubai, having just lost to Lianxing, will find it difficult to resist the invasion of the powerhouse. If they can arrange their formation well and fight with all their strength, they may be able to seize a chance to break their zero-point record.

Among the five Second Division matches, Yongwu is a strong team in Second Division A, and Hongbai is the student team of St. John's University, who are also quite skilled. The two sides are sure to have an intense battle.

In addition, in Second Division C, Chouhong will face Wuxing. The former has a long history, but unfortunately, they have already been defeated by the Jingwei youngsters. The latter, in addition to Gong Dingxiang, has many new players participating, and has not yet been defeated. Chouhong must be cautious in the face of battle, and then the outcome is unpredictable. The order of tonight's matches and the list of the two First Division teams are recorded below:

Huamei — Choubai (First Division) 7:00 PM, Chouye

Haiguang — Erhua (Second Division A) 7:00 PM, Jingzong

Yongwu — Hongbai (Second Division A) 8:30 PM, Jingzong

Jianxin — Shanbao (Second Division A) 7:00 PM, Shanbao

Wuxing — Chouhong (Second Division C) 8:30 PM, Chouye

Zhongnong — You 18 (Second Division B) 7:00 PM, You Si

[Huamei] Han Dehui, Xue Xuchu (Captain), Fu Qifang, Li Zongpei, Lu Hanjun, Qin Duyan, Wang Jiuqing, Xue Weichu.

[Chouchang] Yang Changxi (Captain), Gu Shenghui, Kong Hanchen, Weng Shuheng, Yang Changjia, Sun Meiying, Liu Zhenqiu, Zhao Zhenyuan.

[Another News] The Table Tennis Committee continues to organize the fifth distribution of hard table tennis balls. All industrial and commercial organizations and major primary and secondary schools in the city that have organized table tennis groups can bring a letter to the committee's office at Hualian Tongle Club, 194 Nanjing East Road, from today to the 25th to purchase the balls. Each unit is limited to a maximum of two dozens, and the time is from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day.

### Da Gong vs. Pu Team; Huili's Tactics Succeed; Mayor's Cup Basketball Schedule for Tonight

There will be three more matches in the 4th Mayor's Cup men's and women's basketball tournament today, held at the City Gymnasium. The first match, originally scheduled for 5:30 PM between the women's teams John and Eagle, was changed because the Eagle team is organized by students from Shanghai University, and today happened to be an exam day. As the Mayor's Cup does not allow rescheduling, it was agreed with the other five teams to adjust the schedule and time accordingly. Ticket prices remain the same: 5,000 upstairs, 10,000 downstairs, and 20,000 for reserved seats. The revised schedule is as follows:

Huili — Maoxun (Men's Division) 6:00 PM

John — Eagle (Women's Division) 7:00 PM

Da Gong — Pu Team (Men's Division) 8:00 PM

The first match is between Huili and Maoxun. Huili tied for third place with the Shanghai Police in this year's league. The team originally had a Northern style, but since receiving guidance from Wu Chengzhang and the assistance of Ye Yunshan and Chen Zhengmiao, their appearance has been completely refreshed, and their skills have also improved steadily. Their strength is undoubtedly strong. Maoxun is the second-place team in Division B of the second tier. With capable and brave players such as Sun Jia, Liu Zhaoren, and Zhuo Guanzheng, they are no longer just anyone, but with such a strong opponent tonight, the chances of victory are slim.

The second match is the battle between two women's teams, John and Eagle. Both sides are school teams with similar strength. The former has good players such as Li Miao, Zhu Min, Lin Jingyi, and Zhang Luoluo, while the latter, under the leadership of Wang Shan, also has impressive skills. When they meet, the outcome is unpredictable.

The last match is between Da Gong and the Pu Team. Da Gong's strength is well-known to Shanghai fans. After returning from their overseas expedition, they publicly revealed their skills for the first time yesterday, defeating the foreign team McLeans, and their skills have improved even further. The five players Cai Wenhua, Cai Lianke, Tu Wenlong, Cai Zhongqi, and Huang Bailing are as fierce as tigers. Wang Cunzhong, Zhan Chen, and Zhang Gensheng also have unique performances. The Pu Team is composed of fellow Fujianese, and also has good players such as Lin Qiren, Huang Wencheng, and Ke Bingyan. However, Da Gong should be able to advance smoothly today.

### A Tense Basketball Game; Police/Machine vs. Xishang and Postal/Telecommunications; The Difference in Scores Did Not Exceed Five Balls

[Wuxi News] The Shanghai top-tier teams Police/Machine and Kang Basketball Team, due to their admiration for the scenic beauty of the local area, especially made a joint expedition to Laixi yesterday. Starting from 3:30 PM on the 15th of this month, two friendly matches were held at the park's court. There was a sea of people, with a total number of spectators exceeding 3,000, an unprecedented event.

In the first match, Police/Machine played against the local Jiangnan University team. After the start of the game, they fought fiercely, with each team taking turns taking the lead. At the end of the first half, the visiting team led by 11-10. In the second half, Police/Machine had ample stamina, and their offensive became even stronger. As a result, the visiting team defeated the Jiangnan University team 25-16. In the second match, the local champions Postal/Telecommunications played against the strong Kang Team. At precisely 4:30 PM, Postal/Telecommunications and the Kang Team entered the court, and the mood inside the court immediately became heated and tense. It was found that for this expedition to Xixi, the Kang Team, in addition to their original players Lu Dazhen, Wang Chang'an, Rong Chengen, Tong Yanxuan, and Xu Shunfu, also invited Liang Yongbiao, Gao Jiaji, and Zhang Tianxiang, all renowned players from Chengyou and Chunmao, to assist them, which was like adding wings to a tiger, greatly increasing their strength. However, in this match, although Postal/Telecommunications was missing key players Gao Baosheng and Jiang Guoping due to official duties, they still had seven tiger generals, Wang Chunyuan, Wu Jinwen, Lu Qingbao, Li Fangying, Dai Yaozhang, Tang Minsheng, and Yu Yao, taking turns to fight, so the lineup was still extremely strong. After the start of the game, the two sides engaged in close combat, which was extremely tense, and the performance was extremely spectacular. At the end of the first half, Postal/Telecommunications led by 16-10, ahead by six points. After changing baskets and fighting again, Postal/Telecommunications not only had a strict defense, but also a sharp offense. The visiting team only had Liang Yongbiao performing individually, but Postal/Telecommunications' cooperation was tacit, and the result of the match was that Postal/Telecommunications defeated the Kang Team 44-32.

At 3:30 PM on the 16th, they clashed again at the park's court. In the first match, Police/Machine fought Postal/Telecommunications. The visiting team used their starting lineup of five tiger generals, Gu Zhenji, Yang Yifan, Huang Kegen, Liu Yuchang, and renowned player Chen Wenzao, from beginning to end. Since Postal/Telecommunications' key players Gao Baosheng and Jiang Guoping were absent, they still faced the enemy with yesterday's lineup. After the start of the game, the defenses of both sides were tight, and the performance was in full swing. The battle situation was extremely tense. At the end of the first half, Postal/Telecommunications led 5-4, ahead by a valuable one point. After changing sides, Police/Machine's Gu Zhenji made a long-range shot, and the visiting team took the lead at 6-5. Postal/Telecommunications' Tang Minsheng tied the score, and then took the lead again. After Li Fangying scored again, Postal/Telecommunications took the lead for the third time. At this time, the game was nearing the end, and the battle situation became even more heated. As a result, the visiting team was fortunate to rely on several free throw opportunities, and narrowly won against Postal/Telecommunications by one point at 10-9. In the second match, a major battle was fought between the local strong team Gengyu and the Kang Team. After the start of the game, the visiting team had impressive momentum and were in full force. Liang Yongbiao, Lu Dazhen, and Wang Chang'an were unusually active. In the first half, the visiting team led 22-9. After changing sides, the Kang Team's iron hooves trampled everywhere, accumulating points, but Gengyu had not practiced for a long time, so their performance was stiff. As a result, the visiting team won their first victory at 40-22.

Starting at 3:30 PM on the 17th, Postal/Telecommunications was originally scheduled to play against Sider. At 4:00 PM, Police/Machine was scheduled to play against Gengyu again. Both matches were excellent, but due to the uncooperative weather, they were announced to be postponed.

### Chinese-Western Football Friendly Match; Jingwu to Play British Navy Today

The British Navy's London team is scheduled to play a football friendly match against Jingwu's young players at Yiyuan today at 4:30 PM. Tickets are 8,000 yuan for general admission and 14,000 yuan for special admission. The referee is He Chunhui, and the linesmen are Wang Chongye. The other linesman will be appointed by the British Navy.

The London team is the same group of players who played against the Railway team last month. They have high skills, ample strength, and a style of play where the ball and the player arrive together. They led by one goal against the Railway team until the last five minutes, when the Railway team tied the score. Furthermore, in the second half, their central defender Bo Peiqi had to leave the field due to an eye injury, and they only had ten players playing, otherwise they would have been able to maintain their victory. This shows the team's strong strength.

The Jingwu Shuangfeng, under the guidance of Zhu Qigong, have made rapid progress in their skills and have a tacit understanding of cooperation. Today, all their elite players will play, determined to compete with the foreign players. At that time, there will definitely be a spectacular and fierce battle. Jingwu announced that players are expected to arrive at Yiyuan before 4:00 PM. The lineups of both sides are as follows:

Jingwu

Gao Zhiwen, Chen Huimin, Huang Lifu, Zheng Deyao, Zhao Baoli, Chen Zhigang, Yu Qi, Chen Lianglian, Fang Lianqiu, Wang Guoguang, Wu Jingren, Zhuang Xinjia, Chen Yifei, Fan Benjun

To strengthen its team and increase interest, the Zhichao team will invite several players from Longtou and Zhonghang to assist. Qingbai will also invite Gao Baozheng to cooperate, and has already received Baozheng's approval. Xu Wenkui announces to Jiang Guanqing, Xue Peiran, and Zhang Renyi that if there are no exams at school tomorrow, he hopes to see them at the match. The originally scheduled match between Longtou and Sanxing tomorrow has been postponed to Sunday with the agreement of both parties. The match between Jiushi and Yingguang was also postponed after discussions between the two sides yesterday.

### A Casual Discussion on Being One Step Late

— Fan Shouwu

The interference of officials leads to political incompetence; the ultimate consequence of political incompetence is the disintegration of the system and a change in history. This is a matter of regret, the same both at home and abroad, in ancient and modern times.

Reading the newspaper from Japan on the 11th, there was a news item titled "One Step Late," which roughly stated: "...During the price control period, a large batch of five-yuan yarn printed in the United States has already arrived. Unfortunately, at the moment of its arrival, the bills have become ineffective due to the inability to supply market circulation, equivalent to waste paper. The authorities will investigate the responsibility..." Such a bizarre thing is truly a tragedy of the end of the century.

The fact of being "one step late" is regrettable, but it has been repeatedly seen in our country. For example, in 1947, when the Yellow River flooded, although hundreds of thousands of people were starving and waiting to be fed, government officials also loudly called for relief. However, while loudly advocating high ideals, they allowed the relief flour of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to ferment in warehouses, to the point of becoming moldy. By the time the "responsibility was investigated" (?), and funds were raised again, more than one hundred thousand descendants of the Yellow Emperor had already gone to Shouyang Mountain because the relief was "one step late," to wander with Bo Yi and Shu Qi.

The story of being "one step late" is not only a recent occurrence, but there are many precedents in history. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Hong Chengchou was the governor-general of Ji and Liao, and his army marched out of Shanhaiguan, but was defeated by the Manchurian cavalry and retreated to Songshan (southwest of Jinzhou), where they were surrounded by the Manchurian army. Hong Chengchou saw that the morale in the city was still strong and there was nothing to worry about except for the empty granaries. He had no choice but to recruit daredevils to break through the siege and appeal to Beijing for help. The Chongzhen Emperor immediately ordered the Ministry of Revenue to quickly transport grain by sea for support. The Ministry of Revenue believed that sea transport required seagoing ships, so they drafted a document, shifting the responsibility for the ships to the Ministry of Works. Upon receiving the document, the Ministry of Works stated that the shipwrights and shipyards were mostly on the islands of Deng and Lai in Shandong, so they followed suit and issued a document to local officials in Shandong, urging them to handle it urgently. This public affair, which was a matter of life and death for the country, like "rescuing soldiers as if rescuing from fire," was delayed by bureaucratic foot-dragging. By the time Hong Chengchou ran out of food and surrendered to the Qing, Li Chuang entered Beijing, the Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide, the Qing troops entered the customs, and Prince Fu declared himself emperor in Nanjing, in this long process, the "snail's pace" of official documents had barely reached the office of the governor of Fujian. The content was: "Order to immediately purchase and build sea-going ships and timber for transporting grain," and so on.

Based on this, the "advanced" examples of being "one step late" are numerous! Some people say that those financial officials who delayed the "market launch" of the five-yuan gold yuan notes, although suspected of "wasting national currency," actually had the merit of "contracting currency" and reducing issuance. Even in terms of administrative efficiency, they seem to be a step ahead of the officials of the late Ming Dynasty. In that case, we can at least comfort ourselves.

### Celebrity Insurance

We often see Hollywood film companies advertising that Marlene Dietrich's legs are insured for millions of dollars, and Diana Durbin's voice is insured for millions of dollars, etc. Although these are publicity stunts, they are also based on facts. Because Hollywood stars are indeed insured when filming. If an insured star suffers a loss to the film company due to illness or accidental injury during the filming period, the insurance company that underwrites the policy is obligated to pay compensation.

Strangely enough, the insurance company that underwrites this type of insurance is not an American company, but a British company called "Lloyd's of London," located far across the ocean. The first person to think of insuring stars was the Hollywood production tycoon David O. Selznick. At the time, no American insurance company was willing to do this business, so Lloyd's underwrote it. Later, other producers followed suit, and American insurance companies also competed to underwrite, but Lloyd's, with its long history, still dominated. Although its maximum compensation for each film company is $750,000.

Every year, millions of dollars flow from Hollywood to Lloyd's coffers, which also earns a lot of foreign exchange for the British government. Before each film is shot, the "star insurance" is handed over to Lloyd's through insurance brokers in Los Angeles. Every star listed on the insurance policy must go to a designated doctor for a physical examination within three days before filming begins, so that the insurance company knows their health condition.

In the files of Lloyd's of London, there is a detailed statistical record of the personal history of every major star in Hollywood. To know if a star has tooth decay or swollen blood vessels, or what their blood pressure is, whether they drink or smoke excessively, just check these files and you will know.

"Celebrity insurance" reduces a lot of losses for producers. For example, when David O. Selznick was filming "Since You Went Away," the losses suffered due to the illness or accidents of the lead stars Claudette Colbert, Jennifer Jones, etc., which delayed the filming, were compensated by Lloyd's for $354,000. In the past, when a star could not film due to some reason, all losses were borne by the producer alone, but now there is someone to share the burden.

### Gold Bars and Fried Dough Sticks

— ·Xiao Kangshi·

On "August 19th," the day of price controls, a large gold bar was worth 2,000 gold yuan.

Now, a fried dough stick costs 3,000 gold yuan.

How long has it been since the price of a gold bar in the past can no longer buy a single fried dough stick today, which is truly bewildering!

### A History of Eating Meat

— Xu Dasan

There are many records about eating in public and private documents. However, this article is about eating meat, not quoting classics and making textual research, but only a brief recollection of the ups and downs in my personal history of eating meat.

My attitude towards eating meat is like that of a wine lover, welcoming both fat and lean. One piece in the mouth, and I feel its endless flavor. I remember when the War of Resistance against Japan first broke out, when I was at the prime of my life, I ran to the interior, also proud to wear a set of grass-green uniforms. The boot camp was in Jingdezhen. The cheap prices there were beyond expectations. Pork was 28 copper coins per catty, and chicken was 30 coins. The government provided six yuan per month for food, and also provided free military rice. The six yuan was used entirely to buy vegetables, and the three-compartment tin lunchbox was always full of pork every day. The weather was hot, and the large pieces of glistening fatty meat were especially greasy; although the cook's cooking skills were not sophisticated, I did not dislike the roughness, and was very lucky. I enjoyed at least half a box of pork.

In Hunan in 1939, the price of meat was also very cheap, pork was one dime per catty, and beef was one yuan for twenty catties. Because I couldn't stand the Hunanese chili rice, I took care of my own meals, which suited my liking even more. Vegetables were not even on the table, and everything was about meat. Sometimes I was too lazy to cook, so I went to restaurants. The most delicious meat in Hunan restaurants was steamed pork with rice flour. This kind of steamed pork with rice flour can be eaten even by people who are afraid of greasy food; it was naturally even more suitable for me. A large bowl was enough to fill me up, and a small bowl required two. When the Hunan waiters asked me in Changsha dialect about wine and rice, I always shook my head, because with rice flour and meat, nothing else was needed. This was the golden age of my history of eating meat, worthy of being called the "Reign of Zhenguan." Unfortunately, after 1940, the currency continued to depreciate, and the salary I earned was not even enough to fill my stomach, let alone eat meat. The history of those six or seven years fell into a dark age, and the misfortune became increasingly severe, to the point where I did not taste meat for an entire half year.

It was not until the Gold Yuan notes were introduced last year, thanks to Chiang Ching-kuo's price controls, that the economy finally stabilized for a while. The salary I received was really useful. My luck in eating meat turned around again. I bought three or five catties, cooked a big pot, and enjoyed it for several days. I was very lucky to eat during those two months, worthy of being called the "Period of Restoration." Unfortunately, the good times did not last long, and misfortune came again; tofu and turnips were nowhere to be found, so where was there meat? Even if there was, I could only sigh at the meat and call out in vain. It was not until the New Year that I bought three catties of meat, and eating it was full of sadness, far from the taste of those years. It was like quenching thirst with plums when passing by a butcher shop and feasting. Sometimes I went to a restaurant and ordered two pieces of salted meat with tofu, and I already felt covered in sweat. Looking back on the past, it was like an old palace maid recounting the affairs of the Tianbao era. Unexpectedly, the small matter of eating meat is also a portrayal of the world in the past ten years.

### A Record of Paying House Tax

— Tao

On the morning of April 15th, at half past eight, the old woman who takes care of the alley and sweeps the garbage brought a house tax payment notice for multiple quarters.

I put down the newspaper and looked at the amount, which was clearly written: three yuan and six jiao. At that time, I really didn't understand whether the three yuan and six jiao referred to gold yuan notes, Yuan silver dollars, or the cost of living index?

At this time, many people had gathered in the alley, discussing what the three yuan and six jiao actually meant.

Sister Zhang said: "This three yuan and six jiao is probably silver dollars, right? Otherwise, three yuan and six jiao in gold yuan notes wouldn't even cover the printing costs! Plus the paper costs, labor, wouldn't the government be suffering a big loss? And the government is quite shrewd these days, with this donation one moment and that donation the next, would it really be such a fool as to lose money on this honest and straightforward house tax?"

Mrs. Wang said: "I think it's the cost of living index of three yuan and six jiao, right? Three yuan and six jiao in silver dollars would be more than 400,000!"

"That's right! It must be the index, it must be the index. Calculating according to silver dollars would be too harsh" – everyone said.

"Then, we should pay according to the index! When they announce it at eleven o'clock, it will be at least tens of thousands of times higher, which is far different from the last time's 3,402 times!" Mr. Li said, barging in.

"Hmm—" Everyone hummed, Sister Zhang looked at Mrs. Wang, and Mrs. Wang looked at Mr. Li.

Mrs. Wang's gaze shot east and swept west, stopping abruptly on my face.

"Mr. Zhang, why don't you go first! You are young, move fast, and are good with your words. If it really is calculated according to the index, then come back and let us pay sooner."

I could not refuse out of courtesy, so I had to lead the charge and take a trip. And Xiao Mazi from across the street also volunteered to accompany me.

On the way, Xiao Mazi and I seemed to be racing, running wildly.

Soon, the Seventh Office of the Shanghai Municipal Bank was reached.

I handed over the payment notice, and the clerk looked at it: "Three yuan and six jiao."

"Sir, is it gold yuan? Silver dollars? The index?"

"Gold yuan."

"Is it—"

"It's gold yuan, do you hear?"

"Oh! It's three yuan and six jiao in gold yuan!" I said, taking out a five-yuan bill, the bill that had once been rejected by beggars, but unexpectedly came in handy today.

He stamped the payment notice, and handed the receipt and the bill to me, and said:

"What's the use of three yuan and six jiao, I don't want it!"

Xiao Mazi was quite straightforward, took the receipt, didn't even pretend to pay the bill, and left with me.

When we got home, I told the neighbors that the three yuan and six jiao was not Yuan silver dollars, nor the cost of living index, but gold yuan notes. The neighbors all said in unison:

"Really? Is the government really willing to be such a fool? Rare, rare!"

### Poetry in Dishes

— Jiang Deqi

At the end of last month, this column published an article titled "A Poetic Menu." Everyday dishes, once commented on, add a lot of interest to the meal. I vaguely remember a story in Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, volume four, which says:

"Someone wanted to keep a guest for a drink, but had wine and no dishes. He searched his pockets and only found eight copper coins, which was very embarrassing. His wife knew this and said it was easy to handle. She used six coins to buy two eggs, one coin to buy chives, and one coin to buy tofu residue. The first dish was chives noodles topped with two egg yolks. The wife presented it and said: Although it is not a dish, it has meaning, and is named "Two Yellow Orioles Singing in the Green Willows." The second dish was chives noodles with a circle of egg whites. The wife said: It is named "A Row of White Egrets Ascends to the Blue Sky." The third dish was stir-fried tofu residue. The wife said: It is named: "The Window Contains the Snow of a Thousand Autumns on the Western Mountains." The fourth dish was a bowl of clear soup, with two eggshells floating on the surface of the soup. The wife said: It is named "The Gate Moores Ships from Ten Thousand Miles of Eastern Wu." I love this poem and barely pieced it together, please don't laugh at me. The guest praised it greatly."

The above uses three dishes and one soup to allude to a poem by Du Fu. The ancients said "there is wine in poetry," this is "poetry in dishes," which is hilarious. Today's public servants, when guests come and they are short on money, the clever housewife can imitate it.

### More Strange Laws

— Sang

Each state in the United States has its own independent laws. Because of the different customs in each place, the laws made in each place also vary. Among them, there are many very strange laws, the reasons and motives for their enactment are unknown.

For example, in Barry, Vermont, the law requires that you must take a bath once every Saturday night. In Winona, Minnesota, men must grow beards.

Illinois prohibits feeding knife blades to pigs, and prohibits speaking English to pigs. In Winnetka, theater managers have the right to expel customers with smelly feet.

In California, it is not allowed to use airplanes or cars to capture animals, except for whaling. In Ohio, donkeys are not allowed to travel more than six miles per hour.

What is particularly bizarre is that in New York, fathers are prohibited from changing diapers for their children. In Boston, it is forbidden to have a dog at home that is ten inches tall. In Charleston, prisoners must pay a fare to ride in the prison van.

Other strange laws, such as not allowing the use of mouth spray when washing or ironing clothes in San Francisco, and prohibiting the raising of beautiful mustaches in Indiana, are all inexplicable.
