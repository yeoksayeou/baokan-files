### The Shanghai Defense War Develops Towards a Climax: Heavy Casualties for the Communist Army in Pudong, Retreating Towards Qujiazhai in Luxing Town

[Central News Agency, This City] The Songhu Defense Headquarters announced the battle situation: (1) Yesterday was the seventh day since the prelude to the Shanghai Defense War began. There was contact on all lines. Observing the overall situation, the war is developing towards a climax. In recent days, the lines of Yuepu, Yangxing, and Liuhang, as well as Chuansha in Pudong, have been the most intense. Although the bandits mobilized their elite forces to attack our areas fiercely, our defending troops were incredibly brave and determined to defend and counterattack their positions to the death, so the bandits were ultimately unable to succeed. After a night of fierce fighting from the evening of the 17th to the morning of the 18th, the bandits suffered heavy casualties. A certain unit of our army in the Yangxing area attacked the bandits facing them at noon yesterday. After three hours of fierce fighting, the bandits, seeing that the situation was not good, retreated three li. After our army completed the task of annihilating the bandits, they returned to their original positions to defend them, so the daytime battles in the Yuepu and Liuhang areas were quiet. (2) According to the captured bandits, a certain bandit army in the Yuepu, Yangxing, and other areas has suffered heavy casualties since the beginning of the battle. The remaining troops have lost their combat capabilities and have now been replaced by a certain follow-up unit, preparing to make a comeback. The morale of our front line is high, and we are waiting in full battle array to give the invading bandits a serious blow.

[Central News Agency, This City] The Songhu Defense Headquarters announced the battle situation on the 18th: (1) A portion of the bandits began to harass our Yangxing position again at 8:00 p.m. yesterday (the 17th). Another group of scattered bandits attempted to infiltrate our positions at Shizilin and Yuepu. Our army, in order to thoroughly eliminate the invading bandits, coordinated infantry, artillery, and air forces to intercept them. The bandit army suffered heavy casualties, and their offensive was thwarted. By dawn, the fighting on the entire line had subsided. (2) The invading bandits, with four cannons attached, attempted to infiltrate the Qian Family Residence south of our Xitang Bridge. A certain unit of our army dispatched strong troops to attack the flanks of the bandits. The bandits abandoned more than 30 corpses and retreated towards Xiaonanxiang. (3) A certain army of ours organized a commando team at 5:00 a.m. this morning (the 18th) to sweep away the bandits in Xin Zhuang. The bandits fled upon hearing the news, and our army safely returned to their defenses at 7:00 a.m. (4) The battle in Pudong has already begun. From dusk yesterday (the 17th) to this morning (the 18th), the bandits launched attacks in separate groups against our forward positions in Jinjia Bridge, Xinlu Town, Sajiazhai, and other places. The defending troops, in coordination with the navy, air force, and artillery, continuously bombarded the bandits fiercely, especially the artillery, whose power directly bombarded the bandit reinforcements. Because the bandits suffered too many casualties, they retreated towards Qujiazhai in Luxing Town. Our army is currently pursuing and suppressing them.

### Commander-in-Chief Tang Issues a Statement: Exert Great Strength to Win the Final Victory

[Central News Agency, This City] A reporter visited Commander-in-Chief Tang at the front line yesterday. He took the time out of his busy schedule to receive the reporter and said: "The Songhu Defense War began on the 12th and has now lasted for a week. The Communist bandits have successively attacked Yuepu, Yangxing, Qibao, and Pudong, and the fighting has been extremely fierce. Our army, relying on its high morale and strong fortifications, has dealt severe blows to the invading bandits everywhere. The 28th and 29th armies of the bandits have already been routed and cannot form an army. Their newly added 31st and 33rd armies, as well as the 25th and 30th armies that attacked Pudong, have also been severely hit. Although the bandits have repeatedly changed and redeployed their troops and continued to attack in recent days, under the close coordination of our navy, army, and air force, we have continuously inflicted heavy damage on them, causing them heavy losses and achieving preliminary victories. The purpose of this war to defend Greater Shanghai is to protect the freedom, lives, and property of the six million citizens of Shanghai, and to protect the only economic and cultural center of the country. As the war approaches the suburbs of the city, the citizens of the city remain calm and composed, living as usual, and enthusiastically launching a campaign to support the troops, which shows that cherishing freedom is a basic requirement of everyone. This is indeed a gratifying phenomenon. I am entrusted with the responsibility of defending the territory and protecting the people. I have the greatest determination to protect the lives and property of the citizens of Shanghai and to maintain the equipment of the factories. I must do my best to maintain the peace and order of the urban area. If there are unscrupulous elements and communist spies who spread rumors, slander, and attempt to divide the feelings between our army and the people, or harass and rob, they will be killed without mercy. When our officers and soldiers of the navy, army, and air force, and all the citizens cooperate closely and with one heart and one mind, fighting for freedom, I believe that we will be able to exert great strength and win the final victory of the Lacquer Shanghai Defense War, and the suburbs of Shanghai will definitely be the graveyard of the Communist bandits, without any doubt."

### The National Army's Positions in Yuepu and Yangxing are as Solid as a Rock

[Central News Agency, This City] The Songhu Defense Headquarters issued a battle report at 11:00 a.m. on the 18th: (1) In the Yuepu, Shizilin, and Yangxing areas, the bandit army's offensive has been repeatedly thwarted for days, and the total number of casualties is more than two armies, but the bandit army is very stubborn and does not hesitate to treat human lives as child's play. Starting at 8:00 p.m. last night (the 17th), they tried to attack again. Therefore, from last night to dawn today, the sound of artillery was deafening, the sound of killing shook the sky, and it was extremely tragic. After a night of fierce fighting, our army's position is still as solid as a rock, and we have achieved great results. (2) About three to four hundred bandits in the northeast area of Xiaonanxiang concentrated their firepower and harassed the area at 7:00 p.m. last night. Our defending troops immediately launched a fierce counterattack. The battle situation developed to 1:00 a.m. this morning and became even more intense. The area was brightly lit. The bandit army saw that we were prepared and had no chance to take advantage of the situation, so their offensive stopped immediately. The two sides are currently in a stalemate. (3) Last night (the 17th), the bandits mobilized frequently and gathered in the area near Shen Zhuang south of Zhoupu Hesha, which seems to indicate an intention to attack Sanlintang. We are on strict alert. (4) Last night (the 17th), our aircraft groups continuously flew out and fiercely bombed the bandits in Chuansha Zhoupu. Also, our artillery, in coordination with armored vehicles, shelled the bandits in Xujialu, Caojialu, and Xinlu Town all night long. Bandit corpses were scattered all over the field, and our army is waiting for an opportunity to attack.

[Central News Agency, This City] The Songhu Defense Headquarters issued a battle report at 11:00 a.m. on the 18th: (1) Starting at 8:00 p.m. on the 17th, the bandits used all their strength and repeatedly launched a fierce attack on our Yangxing position using human wave tactics. The officers and soldiers of a certain unit of our defending troops fought bravely and counterattacked. At the same time, our divine eagles launched illumination bombs on the bandit positions at night and discovered the bandit artillery positions. Our Wusong Fortress artillery then fiercely bombarded the bandits. Under the guidance of the air force, all the bandit artillery positions were destroyed by us. The battle situation became more and more fierce, and the morale became higher and higher. By the morning of the 18th, the fighting gradually subsided, and our position remained intact. (2) More than a thousand remnants of the bandits sneaked into our army's position in Yuepu Town at dawn on the 17th. Our unit was ordered to attack and completely surrounded the bandits in the area at 9:00 a.m. After three hours of fierce fighting, the bandits were completely annihilated. More than 200 people were captured alive, and three flat-fire guns, more than 20 light and heavy machine guns, hundreds of submachine guns and rifles, and many other spoils of war were seized. (3) More than two thousand remnant bandits launched a fierce attack on our Liujiahang Garrison position using human wave tactics at dusk on the 17th. Our officers and soldiers responded calmly, and the invading bandits suffered heavy losses and casualties. Our position remained unshaken, and the battle was still continuing at dawn on the 18th.

[Central News Agency, This City] The Songhu Defense Headquarters issued a battle report at 11:00 a.m. on the 18th: In Pudong, starting at 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the bandits used the strength of an army to launch a frontal attack on a certain unit of ours, continuously for more than eight times. Our army coordinated infantry and artillery to launch a counterattack against the bandits. Bandit corpses were piled up like mountains, mostly innocent young men and strong men who were temporarily coerced to act as human shields. In addition, two regiments of bandits who sneaked into Tiedelangzhong Bridge Town in Donggou are currently being surrounded and severely attacked by a certain unit of ours. Detailed battle results are being investigated.

[Central News Agency, This City] Military News: After 11:00 p.m. on the night of the 17th, the bandits in Shizilin, Yuepu, Yangxing, Liuhang, and other places launched continuous wave-like offensives against us, all of which failed. According to reports from the front, the severity of the bandit casualties was the highest seen in the week since the Shanghai Defense War began.

[Central News Agency, This City] The Songhu Defense Headquarters issued a battle report: (1) More than three thousand bandits harassed Xinlu Renqiao, Zhangjiangzha, and other places at around 9:00 p.m. on the 17th. Our defending troops blocked and attacked them separately. The bandits tried several times to break through our army's position, but all failed. Our loyal and brave officers and soldiers became more and more courageous as they fought, giving the bandits a head-on blow. In this battle, more than a thousand bandits were killed or wounded, more than a hundred were captured alive, and countless spoils of war were seized. Detailed battle results are being investigated.

### Commander-in-Chief Gui Leads the Fleet to Bombard the Communist Army in Pudong District

[Central News Agency, This City] Navy Commander-in-Chief General Gui Yongqing has been supervising multiple ships of the Navy's × Fleet for days. In cooperation with the army and air force outside Wusongkou, they have shelled the bandit army invading the Northwest defense line of Shanghai in the Yuepu and Yangxing areas, achieving great results. Now, because the bandit army is moving in Pudong again, in addition to ordering Commander Ma Jizhuang of the × Fleet to command his brave subordinates to attack, he also personally took the government ship on patrol to the waters of Pudong and Wusong districts yesterday morning (the 18th), using fierce artillery fire to severely annihilate the invading bandit army, killing and wounding thousands of people. According to Commander-in-Chief Gui, the army will cooperate with the army in combat and is determined to defend Greater Shanghai with all its strength and give the bandit army a serious blow. In the past three years, the navy has been operating in the Yangtze River area. Although the river surface is narrow and the back is easily threatened, it has not been able to fully exert its combat power, but thanks to the officers and soldiers who have worked hard, it has still been able to achieve the intended mission and achieve great results. For example, naval ships cooperated with Wu Zhongjian's army to defend Anqing for a long time, annihilating tens of thousands of bandits, causing the bandits not to dare to look directly at it. If the entire war situation had not changed, Anqing would never have been occupied by the bandits. At present, in the Shanghai Defense War, the navy's scope of activities is wide, and it is cooperating with a strong army and air force. I believe that it will be able to defend it without any worries.

[Another dispatch] Tang Commander-in-Chief Enber believes that the ships of the Navy's × Fleet have made great contributions to the war to defend Greater Shanghai, especially in crushing the bandit army's attempt to break through the Yuepu Yangxing defense line and occupy the Wusong District. They have made great contributions to stabilizing the war situation. In addition to personally going to Commander Ma's flagship to express his encouragement, he will also issue a reward of 20,000 silver dollars to reward all the loyal and brave officers and soldiers of the ship.

### The Jiangnan Volunteer Corps Assists the National Army in Combat

[Central News Agency, This City] On the 16th of this month, the Communist bandits in the Sanlintang area near Minhang attempted to coordinate with the general offensive to encircle Greater Shanghai and repeatedly launched sneak attacks around Sanlintang. The first battalion of the seventh detachment of the third general team of the Jiangnan Volunteer Corps of the Youth Salvation Corps was stationed there. The battalion commander Cao Yingwu immediately led more than 400 officers and soldiers to bravely attack. After day and night of fighting, they gave the Communist bandits a serious blow and finally caused them to flee in defeat. A few officers and soldiers of the battalion also sacrificed heroically. However, it is noted that the Volunteer Corps is a civilian armed force, composed entirely of patriotic and enthusiastic young people. Ammunition and supplies are self-raised. After continuous battles with the bandits, the ammunition is exhausted and the food is depleted. The team has telegraphed the Municipal National Defense Department's Civilian Armed Forces Supervision Office, requesting that it find a way to quickly replenish it so that it can continue to kill the enemy and strengthen the defense line of Greater Shanghai, and give play to the patriotic and revolutionary spirit of the enthusiastic young people. It is heard that the Municipal Supervision Office will immediately report the battle experience of the battalion to Commander-in-Chief Tang, requesting that he quickly replenish the battalion with food and ammunition, and also requesting that the food and ammunition be widely distributed to the general teams under the jurisdiction of the Supervision Office so that the volunteer salvation soldiers stationed in the suburbs can serve the country.

### The Air Force Conducts Extensive Bombing and Strafing, Achieving Fruitful Results

[Central News Agency, This City] The Shanghai Defense War has been going on for the seventh day on the 18th. Although the Communist army disregards casualties, it still concentrates its attacks on the Wusong Fortress area. It is obvious that it has discovered that it is not easy to attack here, so it has also gathered troops in Pudong, trying to approach the east bank of the river facing the Bund area of Shanghai in order to threaten the urban area of Shanghai from the side. Our army had already anticipated that the Communist army would take this path, so it had already pre-arranged positions in the Pudong area. On the 18th, the Wusong Fortress area and the Pudong area were fighting fiercely at the same time. The air force also concentrated heavy troops over the Wusong area and the Pudong area, bombing and strafing the Communist army, and extensively bombing and strafing the Communist army's supply lines outside the Greater Shanghai defense circle. The results are as follows: (1) Destroyed four Communist army artillery positions northwest of Yuepu, three artillery positions in Fanjiabridge north of Liuhang, and twenty wooden boats inside Xiaonei River from Luodian to Yuepu, and thirty wooden boats from Liuhe to Luodian. More than 1,000 Communist army soldiers were killed or wounded in the Yuepu South Gujiazhai and Yangxing Northwest Baziqiao fortifications.

(5) Discovered five Communist army train cars from Suzhou to Kunshan and destroyed two of them.

### The Legislative Yuan Consults the Executive Yuan to Support the Government's War

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th] The legislators of the Legislative Yuan, in view of the fact that the Chinese Communists are superstitious in force and disregard credibility, and during the peace talks, they proposed their so-called eight articles and twenty-four clauses of the "Domestic Peace Agreement" and set a deadline for acceptance, and brazenly launched a large-scale southern invasion, expanding the war and slaughtering the people, the responsibility for this destruction of peace should be borne by the Chinese Communists. Therefore, at the nineteenth meeting, it passed the "Resolution to Support the Government's Continued War against the Chinese Communists". Yesterday, it specially consulted the Executive Yuan for review. The consultation and resolution are recorded below: Consultation: The nineteenth meeting of the third session of this court has passed the "Resolution to Support the Government's Continued War against the Chinese Communists" for destroying peace, and the record is on file. The corresponding copy of the "Resolution to Support the Government's Continued War against the Chinese Communists" is attached for review. Since New Year's Day of this year, the government has followed public opinion, advocated peace, and tried its best to accommodate and tolerate, sincerely hoping to obtain a fair, reasonable, comprehensive, and permanent peace. This court held a meeting in Beijing and resolved to unanimously support the government's peace policy and called on the Chinese Communists to cease fire. Unexpectedly, during the peace talks, the Chinese Communists proposed their so-called eight articles and twenty-four clauses of the domestic peace agreement and set a deadline for acceptance. They then launched an offensive, crossed the Yangtze River, invaded the south, expanded the war, and slaughtered the people. The responsibility for this destruction of peace should be borne by the Chinese Communists. The facts are all there and are recognized by the people of the whole country. Based on past experience, the colleagues of this court deeply understand the Chinese Communist's attempt to subvert the country and enslave the people. In other words, (1) the war launched by the Chinese Communists is an international war of aggression, not a simple domestic war. (2) The Chinese Communists are fighting against all the people who love freedom. This war is not a war between parties, but a war between good people against violence. (3) The Chinese Communists seized power by violence, and their purpose is to destroy democracy and implement totalitarian politics. (4) Under the Chinese Communist rule, not only are the lives and property of the people not guaranteed, but families are broken up, ethics are confused, and the people have no possibility of free life. Our people throughout the country must rise up together to fight for survival, for freedom, for human justice, to defend our homeland, and to maintain national independence. We must support the government, unite the anti-communist front, and fight to the end until the Chinese Communists abandon their dream of conquering by force and achieve the final victory.

### Shanghai Citizens Eagerly Launch Work to Comfort the Wounded, Gu Zhenggang, Lei Zhen, and Others Go to the Pudong Front Line to Support the Troops

[Central News Agency, This City] The mutual aid association of the No. 19 district vegetable market vendors on Pingliang Road in this city, the former chairman Shen Changsheng, the current chairman Zhang Er, and the chief of general affairs Yao Huaian, etc., are angered by the rebellious behavior of the communist bandits, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, and automatically launched the association members to engage in the work of comforting the wounded in order to cooperate with the Greater Shanghai Defense War. In the past, they automatically purchased dozens of pieces of white cloth for the second group of the No. 65 Hospital on Pingliang Road to bandage the wounds of the officers and soldiers wounded in the front, and decorated the ward with a new look.

[Central News Agency, This City] The second group of the No. 65 Wounded Soldier Hospital on Pingliang Road in this city accommodated more than 200 lightly and severely wounded soldiers on the evening of the 15th.

On the morning of the 16th, when citizens went to the vegetable market to buy vegetables, they found the heroic soldiers who were wounded in the battle to defend Shanghai were groaning.

### Postal Simple Life Insurance Fees Changed to Silver Yuan

[Report from the Central News Agency, Guangzhou, on the 18th] According to information from the local post office: Postal simple life insurance has been operating for many years and has an excellent reputation. In recent years, due to the depreciation of the gold yuan, the insurance has lost its original purpose of safeguarding the lives of the public. In response to the current practical needs of the public, the Postal Remittance and Savings Bureau has revised the one-year term life insurance plan for simple life insurance and changed the fees to silver yuan. The main points are as follows: (1) The insurance is temporarily limited to 500 silver yuan; (2) The premiums are paid annually according to age, ranging from 120 yuan to 21 yuan for ages 12 to 60; (3) The application procedure is extremely simple and convenient, and compensation is prompt. It is reported that the above plan has been ordered by the bureau to be implemented on a trial basis nationwide.

### Editorial: Silver Yuan Price Listed Today!

The issue of listing the price of silver yuan, which has been brewing for a long time, has been decided by the Central Bank yesterday that it will officially list the price of silver yuan starting today. Three measures have been decided: (1) Silver yuan will be listed starting today; (2) The Central Bank will resume issuing silver yuan for the overnight deposit balances of various banks and firms starting today; (3) Various banks and firms should issue silver yuan to customers as much as possible from their reserves starting today. As for the price of silver yuan and the percentage of silver yuan issued by the Central Bank to various banks and firms, it will be decided this afternoon.

Regarding this issue, the Gold and Silver Equalization Committee of the Central Bank originally planned to implement it on the 16th of this month, but later feared that it would stimulate prices and did not materialize. It is said that the authorities, considering the high or low price of silver yuan directly affects the stability of the market, felt that it was necessary to consider it. However, according to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, if the price of silver yuan is not listed as soon as possible, the gap between the black market price and the official price of silver yuan will widen, and labor-management disputes will arise repeatedly when new salaries are paid in the middle of the month, making it impossible to reach a coordination. Therefore, representatives have been sent to appeal for remedial measures. Originally, it is unreasonable to rigidly regulate the price of silver yuan. If the listing of silver yuan is not realized as soon as possible, it will be difficult for the city's economy and finance to return to the normal track.

Since the authorities rigidly stipulated the exchange rate of silver yuan to gold yuan at 1:4 million, the price of silver yuan seems to have become relatively stable, and the general price level seems to have also stabilized. However, this is only a superficial observation. If we analyze it carefully, we will know that this idea is completely inadequate.

First, the essential requirement for limiting the price of silver yuan is that all kinds of silver yuan are universally used regardless of the version. Under this circumstance, it is difficult to escape Gresham's Law of "bad money drives out good money." Therefore, the market has been full of Eagle, Dragon Yang, and miscellaneous silver yuan transactions in recent days, while Big Head and Small Head have disappeared.

Second, before the price limit, the market prices of Eagle, Dragon Yang, and miscellaneous silver yuan were mostly around 3 million yuan. Since the rate of 1 silver yuan to 4 million yuan was stipulated, the prices of Big Head and Small Head have increased even more. However, there are also those who sell at the legal price, but that is only because middle and lower class families and salaried people have to endure the pain of selling "Big Heads" to meet the expenses of firewood, rice, oil, and salt.

Third, some attribute the recent phenomenon of price stability or decline to the price limit of silver yuan. In fact, this statement is extremely far-fetched, because the price stability or decline does not refer to all prices, but is limited to some luxury goods and non-essential goods. The stability or decline of these many items is due to sluggish sales, weak purchasing power, and poor turnover of industry and commerce, not because silver yuan itself has this magic power. On the contrary, the prices of essential commodities such as rice and vegetables have risen several times. From this, it can be explained that price increases and decreases are entirely due to environmental and supply-demand relationships.

From the above facts, it can be seen that rigidly limiting the price of silver yuan does not help much in suppressing prices. Moreover, the price of silver yuan is always fixed at the rate of 4 million yuan, which not only loses the normal transaction of silver yuan, but also causes the price of silver yuan in this city to become out of sync due to the higher price of silver yuan elsewhere. For example, a few days ago, the official price of Big Head silver yuan in Fuzhou was only 4 million yuan. The distance between the two is so large, how can it not force the outflow of Big Heads?

The reason why we advocate the listing of the price of silver yuan now is not only because the prices of silver yuan in various places are . In fact, although silver yuan is not a legal currency, it already has the form of currency and . Therefore, its status in society cannot be taken lightly. Also, because it has real value compared to the gold yuan and is more active than commodities, it can be converted into currency or goods at any time. Therefore, its price is naturally more stable. This phenomenon is especially prominent in "Big Heads" that are used as speculative chips. In the current situation, there is no reason to suppress it. Therefore, we believe that the authorities' regulations on the price of silver yuan should not be too rigid, nor should they be too low. We are still in a chaotic period. It is definitely not easy to manage the price limit well. If we go the other way and guide everything according to the situation, it will be easier to achieve more concrete results.

The most obvious drawback of limiting the price of silver yuan is that the Central Bank does not have silver yuan income at the official price, and the silver yuan issued in the items of industry and commerce and ordinary banks is priced at the officially set rate. Although this loss is a loss for the Central Bank, it is actually a loss for the national treasury. There is also the issue of industrial and commercial enterprises inflating the number of workers and falsely claiming "rationed" silver yuan. It is not absolutely non-existent, and the fact that general banks and firms are unwilling to "ration" the "rationed" silver yuan to customers at the official price is even more well known. Therefore, fixing the official price only creates opportunities for a few people to gain special benefits. To this day, the country still has to suffer this unnecessary loss, and we really want to speak up for it.

Economic phenomena are obviously different from political and military phenomena. All facts must conform to the balanced state of natural development. If we want to break this balanced situation, it will form a deformed development that is not suitable for economic principles. The attitude we hold towards the price of silver yuan can be explained by this. In the current stage, if we want the price of silver yuan to be consistent with the natural level, we can only abandon the price limit policy, establish an open market for silver yuan on the one hand, and have the Central Bank's Gold and Silver Equalization Committee refer to the actual situation in the market and adjust the price of each version of silver yuan day by day. Only in this way can we break the deadlock of the silver yuan price issue. As for how to prevent the excessive rigidity of the silver yuan price, it depends on the Central Bank's strength in controlling silver yuan. But, in any case, the Central Bank's decisive decision to start listing prices from today is still a wise measure.

### The Front Line at Yuepu

— Our Special Correspondent Shi Zhi

[Report from our office on the 18th] In the dim morning light, my colleague, the newspaper's photographer Lu Shunxing, and I drove our jeep towards the Jiangwan-Wusong and Wuyuepu roads to conduct our first battlefield visit since the outbreak of the Shanghai Defense War. In terms of distance, although the round trip was less than 100 kilometers, the hardships we encountered on this trip, especially the thrilling scenes, were unprecedented in my 12 years as a war correspondent. Similarly, the hardships and high morale of the front-line soldiers were also unprecedented in my 12 years as a war correspondent. The issue concerning the safety of Shanghai's six million citizens can now be answered in this short article, and as Lu Shunxing said, "This is simply a miracle."

At the Jiangwan Garrison, we first contacted Director Chen Binghuan and General Liu Yuzhang of a certain army by phone. He allowed us to visit his command post for a brief meeting. Accompanied by Section Chief Wang Shupeng, we arrived at the command post in a certain place in Wusong at around 10:00 AM. I hadn't seen General Liu for five or six years. This time, I only felt that he was much thinner than before. Due to commanding the battle for six days and six nights without sleep and constantly holding the telephone, his voice was obviously hoarse. But one thing I have no doubt about is that his spirit has always been full, overflowing with infinite vitality and combat power. This vitality and combat power also symbolize his strong and fighting spirit and fighting will.

This army of General Liu's, whose first and second commanders were Guan Linzheng and Zhang Yaoming, has already written countless epic poems of heroism and sacrifice during the War of Resistance. The only key to its victory over the enemy is the three key points of combat advocated by General Guan Linzheng: "Steady! - Endure! - Root!" This unit still maintains this excellent tradition. Although General Liu only took over as commander after General Qin Yizhi last April, he achieved "three victories in three battles" in the Northeast from July to the end of last year, recovering Liaoyang, attacking Anshan, and recovering Yingkou, completely annihilating Lin Biao's Liaonan Iron Army's Ninth Column - making the enemy tremble at the mention of it. After Liu's unit was transferred south, in the Shanghai Defense War, it was arranged by Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo as the "New Great Wall of Shanghai" without consideration, placed in the most demanding line from Wusong, Shizilin, through Yuepu, Yanglin to Liuhang. General Liu also lived up to the heavy trust of Commander Tang, and has already "tried his hand" and defeated two communist armies in the opening battle of the week-long Shanghai battle.

Our conversation with General Liu was very brief. Because he had to go to the front line to command the battle immediately, besides paying my respects to him and asking about the residence of Commander Zhang Yaoming, there was only Shunxing's photography. Then, he introduced Chief of Staff Hou Chengda to meet me and asked him to tell me about the current battle situation.

Chief of Staff Hou was also an old friend from the War of Resistance. We hadn't met for many years, and it was naturally very kind to meet again, and it made people feel the loveliness and warmth of friendship. Although he was also very busy and had not slept peacefully for six days and nights, he still patiently told me about the battle situation of the past six days.

Chief of Staff Hou first told me that this army had won a great victory. The facts are there and need no emphasis: "Chen Yi's 28th and 29th armies have been killed or wounded by four-fifths of their number, a total of about 30,000 people. Especially the 28th Army of Chen Yi's troops, which is known for its strong attacks, was originally the Ninth Column. In the past, it was the main force in Shandong, attacking Weixian, occupying Yanzhou, and attacking Jinan." Because I lived in Shandong for a long time, I knew more about the quality of Chen Yi's troops. Of course, I had no doubt about what Chief of Staff Hou said.

Chief of Staff Hou continued: Chen Yi's intention was originally to order the 28th and 29th armies to start attacking on the night of the 12th and to order the two armies to break through the positions of the National Army at Shizilin, Yuepu, Yanghang, and Liuhang by the 15th, occupy Wusong, block the Huangpu River, cut off the water connection of the National Army in Shanghai, and then suppress and surround the National Army in Shanghai to carry out the old trick of a "local peace" like in Beiping. He did not expect that on the night of the 12th, after a battalion entered the streets of Yuepu Town using infiltration tactics, the troops guarding in each bunker were not moved at all. After dawn, they joined the reinforcements and, under the personal command of General Liu on the front line of Xinzhen, completely annihilated them. From the 14th to the 15th, for three consecutive days, the communists launched fierce attacks on the entire line from Shizilin in the north, through Yuepu, Yanghang, and Liuhang. In order to gain the initiative, the National Army also counterattacked, so the battle was the fiercest during these three days, and the communist army also suffered the heaviest casualties during these three days. By the 16th, Chen Yi's 28th and 29th armies had not only failed to complete their original mission of breaking through the positions of the National Army and occupying Wusong, but also suffered casualties reaching four-fifths of the entire army. As a result, they were forced to retreat to the second line in the first half of the night of the 16th, taking advantage of the heavy rain to reorganize, and replaced the defense with the 31st and 33rd armies. Because the two armies learned from the previous loss, they changed their tactics to actively attack our entire line at night, while we only launched local attacks at night, and attacked the enemy during the day with the coordination of the sea and air forces. Therefore, as of noon on the 18th, the communist army had not gained any advantage, and the combat power shown by the 31st and 32nd armies was significantly weaker than that of the 28th and 29th armies, especially the 28th Army.

After Chief of Staff Hou reported on the battle situation of the past six days, he finally told me the reasons for the National Army's victory: (1) High morale, (2) Full preparation, (3) Orders carried out, (4) Consistent coordination between the sea, land, and air forces, (5) Flexible command. The reasons for the communist army's failure this time: (1) Copying the past, they intended to break through a point with elite troops, go straight to Wusong, and trap Shanghai, thus committing the mistake of light troops and rapid advance, making it easy for us to annihilate them one by one. (2) They are a "long attack," and we are a "short hit." The so-called "short hit" means one is "short fire" (annihilating the enemy within a short distance), and the other is "short time" (annihilating the enemy in a very short time). Both of these can save ammunition and can encircle and annihilate the enemy. (3) The "human wave tactics" used by the communist army can also be called "duck driving tactics," driving a batch of ducks to the front line. After a batch dies, another batch comes. Fortunately, "they are not their own sons." It is really too inhumane, but this kind of "duck driving tactics" encounters the National Army's well-planned and strong "plum blossom formation" and the elusive "ever-victorious army," and it is just like a mouse getting into an iron cage, "only in and no out."

### British Secretary of State McNeil Announces Non-Recognition of the Franco Government; Unwavering Policy Towards Spain; US Export-Import Bank Temporarily Not Considering Loans to Spain

[British News Agency, London, 18th] At the United Nations General Assembly's plenary session the day before yesterday, the vote on the proposal by South American countries to urge all countries to re-appoint ambassadors and plenipotentiary ministers to Madrid failed to pass because it did not obtain the necessary two-thirds majority. Sixteen countries, including Britain, the United States, and France, abstained, twenty-six countries supported the proposal, and fifteen countries voted against it. When clarifying Britain's attitude, British representative and Secretary of State McNeil stated that the government's policy towards Spain remains consistent. The British government believed that the United Nations General Assembly's resolution in December 1946 to withdraw diplomatic envoys stationed in Madrid would not be effective, and this prediction has proven to be accurate. However, the British government has complied with the resolution and withdrawn its ambassador to Madrid. The British government cannot support the proposal of South American countries because it wants to avoid being misunderstood as agreeing to the actions of Franco and his government. McNeil also stated that neither the British government nor the British people can agree with Franco and his totalitarian government's followers; nor can they agree with the various actions of prohibiting assembly, controlling speech, not conducting fair trials, and prohibiting criticism.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] Well-informed sources said: The Export-Import Bank today rejected the request of Moreni Yang, President of the US-Spanish Bank in Madrid, for a loan of 1.2 billion US dollars to Spain. A senior official of the Export-Import Bank told Moreni that due to various difficulties, the Export-Import Bank had to temporarily suspend consideration of this issue.

### Bevin-Sforza Joint Plan Rejected by the UN General Assembly; The Question of Former Italian Colonies Becomes More Complicated

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 18th] The United Nations General Assembly rejected the Bevin-Sforza joint plan for dealing with former Italian African colonies on the morning of the 18th. Because the General Assembly failed to conclude its affairs in the night meeting, the General Assembly adjourned at 2:32 AM and is scheduled to hold a final extraordinary meeting at 3:00 PM (4:00 AM Shanghai time on the 19th) to try to resolve this complicated issue again.

The failure of the Bevin-Sforza plan has shattered the hope of Western countries that a solution to the former Italian colonial issue is currently possible. The Western countries' attempt to maintain their bases in important strategic areas of Africa through this plan has also been extinguished. The final vote was 14 votes for and 37 votes against, with 7 abstentions. However, this failure was decisive. The signs of the plan's failure were that the main clause dealing with Cyrenaica failed to obtain the necessary two-thirds majority. The clause gave Italy the trusteeship of Cyrenaica, starting in 1951 and continuing until all of Libya (including Cyrenaica and Fezzan) gained independence in 1956. At the time of the vote, 33 voted in favor, 17 voted against, and 8 abstained. After this clause failed, 19 of the 20 Latin American countries that supported Italian trusteeship of the region carried out their threat to block the entire plan, and France also joined this group. This result caused the clauses of British trusteeship of Cyrenaica, French trusteeship of Fezzan, and the incorporation of Eritrea (excluding the west) into Abyssinia to fail, because these clauses all had to obtain a two-thirds majority in the chapter-by-chapter vote. The proposal for Italian trusteeship of Somaliland also failed to obtain a two-thirds majority. The failure of the main clause on Cyrenaica was due to the opposition of the Arab, Asian, and Soviet blocs. At the same time, the General Assembly defeated the Soviet Union's proposal for joint UN trusteeship of the three African colonies by an absolute majority, making Libya and Eritrea independent within five years and Somaliland independent within ten years. The General Assembly also rejected Iraq's proposal, which advocated joint UN trusteeship of Libya and Somaliland and the division of Eritrea between Abyssinia and Saudi Arabia.

### Economic Commission for Europe: US and Soviet Union Engage in Verbal Warfare

[Reuters Geneva 17th Dispatch] At the meeting of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, representatives from the United States and the Soviet Union continued to engage in verbal warfare.

He pointed out that last year, the Soviet Union's exports to Eastern Europe exceeded its imports from Eastern Europe by more than 20%. He also pointed out that the Marshall Plan intended to make Western Europe a new form of colony, preventing Western Europe from developing trade with Eastern Europe, while the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries were prepared to develop trade with the West on an equal and mutually beneficial basis. Representatives from the other nine Eastern European countries, following the Soviet representative, also refuted the accusations made by the US representative, Bohd, yesterday against the Soviet Union, saying that Bohd's words were for propaganda purposes. They also said that Eastern European countries had benefited greatly from the long-term assistance received from the Soviet Union.

### Mrs. Pandit Reiterates Indian Policy in the United States

Absolutely No Participation in Power Blocs

[United Press Washington 17th Dispatch] India's newly appointed Ambassador to the United States, Mrs. Pandit, held her first press conference today, clarifying India's foreign policy. According to reports, "India intends to maintain a non-participatory attitude in the ideological struggle between the Soviet Union and Western countries, and will absolutely not be involved in any power bloc. I believe that the Soviet Union and Western countries can coexist peacefully, but empty words are of no use; both sides must follow up with action." Mrs. Pandit also stated, "India's foreign policy has three major goals: (1) to strive for independence and freedom for oppressed nations; (2) to eliminate racial inequality; and (3) to promote world peace. Communism is not a threat to India, but it is extremely distasteful. India has a very good relationship with Britain and welcomes American investment even more. There is absolutely no danger for foreign investment in India. India is very dissatisfied with the policies previously pursued by the Netherlands in Indonesia and hopes that the Dutch government will fully implement the agreement recently concluded with the Indonesian Republican government."

### Syria-Israel Armistice Negotiations Suddenly Declared Stalled

### US is Watching Southeast Asia: Dutch-Indonesian Armistice Problem is the Current Focus of Agreement; The Situation in China Greatly Impacts Overseas Chinese

[United Press Washington 17th Dispatch] Upcoming events will determine whether Indonesia and Southeast Asia are considered a gain or loss in the record of US Far Eastern policy. The reasons are the following three developments: (1) The Netherlands and the Indonesian Republic and the Indonesian Federation will hold a meeting in The Hague; (2) The continued progress of the Chinese Communists and their impact on overseas Chinese; (3) The US hopes to support a genuine nationalist movement that is not guided by the Communists. Another issue related to the Hague Conference is whether the Indonesian Republican Army will obey the ceasefire order when the political leaders of the Indonesian Republic agree to issue it when the government is moved back to Yogyakarta. Regarding the China issue and the nationalism issue, some people believe that regional agreements are not enough to solve the Pacific problem, but a nationalist movement without communist participation is enough to solve it. Observers believe that Indonesian President Sukarno and Prime Minister Hatta still hold sufficient power to make the army obey the ceasefire, so the Hague Conference has a good chance of success. If so, and Indonesia restores peace, and the Netherlands and the US provide assistance to Indonesian nationalism so that the Communists cannot seize Indonesian leadership, then the Dutch East Indies may become a non-Communist fortress in Southeast Asia. Siam and Malaya have a large number of overseas Chinese, and other countries in Southeast Asia also have many overseas Chinese. The British side has said that the rebellion in Malaya is completely led by overseas Chinese communist elements. Observers here also believe that the chances of the Vietnamese King Bao Dai, supported by France, gaining popular support in Vietnam are no better than those of the Communist leader Ho Chi Minh. It is said that the US currently believes that Southeast Asian countries are extremely unconcerned about each other's problems, so a regional alliance cannot be implemented. Many believe that the influence of communism is the least in Indonesia, so the US has the highest hopes for Indonesia.

### Dutch Government Accepts Resignation of Dutch-Indonesian Commissioner

Believed to Have Fallen Into Soviet Hands

[United Press New York 17th Dispatch] The New York Daily News today published a Washington special dispatch saying that on February 14, three-quarters of a pound—235 "disappeared" from the Chicago Laboratory of the Atomic Energy Commission, and was largely stolen. This is the greatest threat to national security discovered in peacetime, because Uranium-235 is the head of the atomic bomb, used to explode it, and is one of the most closely guarded secrets of the United States. The report also said that three-quarters of a pound is enough for an experienced nuclear scientist to engage in large-scale experiments, thereby completing the structural details of the atomic bomb explosion part. These details are only known to a very small number of people so far. Counterintelligence personnel now believe that the missing uranium is in Soviet hands.

### Clay Returns to Washington from Germany

Receives Great Official Welcome and Accepts Oak Leaf Medal

[United States Information Service Washington 17th Dispatch] General Clay has returned home to retire after a lifetime of outstanding service to the country. He received a hero's welcome. Clay returned to the United States from Germany. He served as the US military commander in Germany for four years and just left office on May 15. Officials immediately prepared to welcome him and hold ceremonies.

This four-star general, who has served in the military since 1918, was responsible for the US Army supply plan during World War II. His most outstanding achievement in Germany was the creation of the air force. After the Soviet Union implemented a land blockade, cutting off normal land supply routes, Berlin relied on air transport to obtain food, fuel, medicine, and other essential necessities for 328 days. Clay often tried to get rid of his current position so that he could retire, but the government did not grant his request because his position was important, until recently when he was allowed to resign. At a press conference, Clay told questioners that he would be very surprised if the Soviet Union re-imposed the Berlin blockade, because the Soviet Union could not ignore the adverse repercussions it would cause worldwide. The United States has made clear its intention to "continue our cooperation, support the Berlin airlift, support European reconstruction, and support the Western European security pact. These actions have gained the trust of Western Europe. The tense situation of two years ago no longer exists today." Clay attributed this to the people's attitude towards the United States' willingness to support the recovery of Western countries. Clay expressed his belief: "It would be unwise for us to withdraw our occupation forces at the present time or in the near future." He stressed: The withdrawal of occupation forces must be implemented after the situation in Europe has stabilized. A reporter requested a detailed discussion of the recently completed East German vote, where more than 1,300 voters voted against the list of candidates designated by the Soviet Union. Clay commented: "This kind of vote represents a very courageous action in any totalitarian country." Regarding the rumored meeting of East and West German politicians, Clay admitted that such meetings had been held several times. He reiterated that people in Soviet-controlled East Germany intended to persuade people in West Germany to reject the proposal to establish a West German government. But he also said: The failure of the East German people was obviously due to the actions taken by the parliamentary council, which voted for a completely democratic government procedure for West Germany. When Clay arrived at the National Airport and stepped off the plane, the honor guard composed of soldiers, airmen, sailors, and marines stood at attention and fired a salute to show respect. Secretary of Defense Johnson stepped forward to shake hands with Clay and welcome him, and expressed the American people's gratitude for "a job well done." In addition to Johnson, the high-ranking officials of the national military organization were also at the airport to welcome him. Thousands of private citizens also warmly welcomed Clay back to the country. General Clay and his wife drove from the airport to the White House, where they were immediately welcomed by the President and Mrs. Truman. In the White House garden, Truman presented the 52-year-old West Point graduate with a medal, to show his appreciation for his "outstanding service to the nation and humanity." Cabinet members, congressional leaders, military dignitaries, and the British and French ambassadors were all present to award Clay the Distinguished Service Medal with an Oak Leaf Cluster. Clay received this medal for the third time. The citation for the award stated that "in the past, he had outstanding achievements in helping to arm our country's troops, and later added new and indelible achievements to his past achievements because of his handling of the difficult work of the military government in Germany... The situation in Germany made his service indispensable, and he was only allowed to retire on May 15 of this year, because his work had reached a milestone after the constitution of West Germany was drafted. His mission was extremely complex and difficult, and the completion of this mission is something that the people of the country will always be proud of." Clay then went from the White House to the Capitol, and had the honor of addressing both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The gallery was packed. As this retired military officer walked through the central corridor of the House to the podium, the crowd stood up and cheered, and Clay gave an impromptu speech. He told the members of the House that the German people had "firmly committed themselves" to the establishment of a government that maintains the dignity of the individual human being. Clay said that the failure of the four-power control of Germany was "due to our discovery that one of the four countries has dual purposes." He did not hide that what he was referring to was the Soviet Union. It is said that the two purposes were: (1) to obtain the maximum amount of compensation; (2) to establish a government that is exclusively controlled or at least exploited by the police state. When speaking to the Senate, Clay denounced the Soviet Union for trying to obstruct European reconstruction and block Berlin. He also said that this was due to the Soviet Union's fear of the American plan to consolidate the free countries of Europe. It is said that the Western European countries' fear of possible Soviet aggression has been dispelled by the conclusion of the North Atlantic Treaty. The Western countries have been trying to cooperate with the Soviet Union for two years to establish a democratic government for the whole of Germany. But "we have not reached a common position. Our purpose has not been achieved, but this setback may have created our greatest victory. We found that free countries must be supported to prevent the forces that threaten the democratic way of life from invading." The United States' launch of the European Recovery Program was the climax. The signing of the Atlantic Treaty eliminated Western Europe's fear of aggression. Clay will go to New York on the 19th to receive an official welcome. Then he plans to return to his hometown of Marietta, Georgia. Lieutenant General Huebner succeeded Clay as the Commander of the US Army in Germany. He will also serve as the US Military Governor until the United States appoints a civilian High Commissioner in accordance with the three-nation agreement on West Germany.

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The second act of the three-team football invitational tournament will take place today at Yuet Yuen, with the Tung Wah Second Team meeting the Tsing Pak Team, starting at 4:30 PM. Tung Wah has not been seen for a long time, and fans have been yearning for it. This time, Tung Wah is making a comeback, adding a large number of powerful players in addition to the original veterans. In particular, the iron gate Ng Ki-cheung is stationed in the center back, and Tse Sek-chuen is assisting in defense, which will be a major obstacle for the Tsing Pak forwards. Whether they can overcome this danger depends on the performance of the Tsing Pak forwards. With the addition of the general Ko Sau-ching, Tung Wah has become even more powerful. As for Tsing Pak, the defender Ngam Sze-sham has decided to play, making the Tsing Pak lineup complete. Today's Tung Wah vs. Tsing Pak battle will undoubtedly be the most valuable and exciting battle of the season. The referee is Fong Wing-fu, the linesmen are Chan Fuk-bo and Tsui Kwok-leung. The ticket prices are divided into two types, 240,000,000 and 160,000,000, for the sake of popularization. In order to maintain order, only 10,000 tickets will be sold. Yuet Yuen will start selling at 10:00 AM today to prevent crowding. The Four Dimensions Boy Scouts will be on the scene to assist the military police in maintaining order. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

Tsing Pak

Wong See-kit

Keung Yuen-chi Chin Cheong-wing Ngam Sze-sham Keung Man-ching

Cheung Yan-yee Mang Yee-leung Fuk Nai-tong

Kam Luk-sang Law Sau-fuk Lau Lung-hing Lau Tai-yan Ku Yee-sat Fei Chun-wah

Tung Wah

Cheung Bong-lun

Chan Leung-lin Hon Nei-bo Ng Ki-cheung Yu Hap-hing Lee Hung-tsun

Lee Yiu Ko Sau-ching Hon Lung-hoi Tsui Cho-kwok Ka Yau-leung Chan Ming-chit Chin Wan-chen Kwan Wing-sheung

In the first match against the Railway Team the other day, Tsing Pak was able to force a 3-3 draw under a declining trend, which proves its rich experience and composure in the face of danger, and its outstanding style as the alliance leader. In addition to Wong See-kit, Keung Man-ching, Mang Yee-leung, and Fuk Nai-tong in defense, Ngam Sze-sham, a representative of the World Games, will put on his jersey again and play as the left back, making it even more seamless and as safe as Mount Tai. The five tigers Law Sau-fuk, Kam Luk-sang, Ku Yee-sat, Lau Lung-hing, and Lau Tai-yan are unparalleled in their charge into battle, and with the addition of Fei Chun-wah, who has returned from Hong Kong to help, it is even more icing on the cake.

Tung Wah has been dormant for a long time. This time, Ka Yau-leung gathered the old troops, reorganized the team, and after two weeks of intensive training, they have regained their past glorious appearance. Goalkeeper Cheung Bong-lun, a national player, needs no introduction. Cheung Lam-kan, with the big saber, sits at the rear, and with the assistance of Tse Sek-chuen, it is even more powerful. On the center back line, in addition to Hon Nei-bo and Yu Hap-hing, Ng Ki-cheung has returned to his mother team to serve, presiding over the center back, forming the strongest camp, which can attack and defend, and is impeccable. The forwards Hon Lung-hoi, Chan Ming-chit, Lee Yiu, and Ka Yau-leung have been partners for many years and have a tacit understanding. Today, with the participation of Ko Sau-ching, it is even more complete. The entire elite of Tung Wah is dispatched, ready to decide the outcome with Tsing Pak. The battle between the two heroes will be fiery, which can be expected.

### Lianxing Table Tennis Overwhelms Qinglian: Three Group B Matches Continue Today

In the fourth Table Tennis League, Lianxing from Group A faced Qinglian at the Jingfen ball room the day before yesterday. Among Lianxing's five players, Chen Xingquan, the chopper, performed the weakest. His chops were high but without spin, and his footwork was slow, making it difficult to stop Qinglian's captain Liu Baotai's fierce attacks. He suffered a straight-set defeat. Although Qinglian was short on manpower, their fighting spirit was strong. After Liu Baotai defeated Chen Xingquan, Liang Menghui bravely fought against Lianxing's main player Hu Yiping. The match was extremely hard-fought. Yiping lost the first game but relied on steady play to win the next two games, reversing the defeat into a victory. The other three Lianxing players, Wu Zuochang, Zhang Shandada, and Feng Hao, all put on excellent performances, easily defeating Qinglian's three players. As a result, Lianxing overwhelmingly defeated Qinglian 4-1, maintaining their record of three wins in three games. Currently, Huamei leads the Group A standings with five wins in five games. The defending champion Jingwu team has repeatedly requested postponements, so they have not yet shown their faces, which is a great concern for fans.

After switching sides, Sanxing attacked fiercely. Xiao Ziwen sent the ball in front of the goal, and Zhang Jie headed it in, making it 1-2. Lin Dianyi crossed the ball, and Wu Binghao headed it in, tying the score at 2-2. In the last three minutes, Wu Binghao scored, turning the defeat into a victory for Sanxing at 3-2.

### Jingwu Wrestling Group Begins Classes

The Jingwu Wrestling Group of the Jingwu Athletic Association has seen a surge in enrollment from middle and high school students since the start of this year's recruitment. The original wrestling room of the group was no longer sufficient to meet the needs. In order to meet the practical needs, the wrestling room of the group's branch was dismantled, expanded, and renovated, and fundraising was immediately started to raise funds for the expansion and renovation. Because the group is the only organization in our country that soundly promotes wrestling, and its achievements are outstanding, it has attracted the attention of enthusiastic sports people in the community. Therefore, fundraising was completed in a few days. Yesterday, the wrestling room of the group was expanded and renovated, and it was brand new. The famous wrestling professor Zhou Shibin led a simple and solemn opening ceremony, and encouraged all members to repay the kindness of enthusiastic donors from all walks of life with their work and study achievements.

### Silver Dollar Price to Be Posted Today: National Bank Announces Four Measures: Silver Dime Exchange at 12 Dimes per Dollar

[This newspaper report] The Central Bank was ordered by the Garrison Authority yesterday to implement the posting of silver dollar prices starting today. The Central Bank yesterday specifically announced four measures related to the posting of silver dollar prices, ordering all relevant parties to implement them: (1) The Political Committee of the Garrison Headquarters in Jing, Hu, and Hang had previously decided that local banks should implement measures for distributing silver dollars to depositors. (That is, the proportion of silver dollars to be distributed will be determined by comparing the previous day's inventory and the number obtained from the National Bank on the current day with the outstanding deposit balance, and it will be announced for implementation.) Strict implementation will begin on the 19th. (2) The Central Bank will implement the posting of silver dollar prices starting on the 19th and will resume the distribution of silver dollars when depositors withdraw deposits from banks. (3) In order to facilitate the banks' distribution, the Central Bank will also distribute silver dimes in addition to silver dollars to the banks, with silver dimes calculated at 12 dimes per dollar. (4) The Political Committee decided that the method for banks to distribute silver dollars to depositors has not been followed by the banks. The reason is likely that the price of silver dollars has not been determined by the Central Bank. It is reported that if banks refuse to comply starting on the 19th, the Garrison Headquarters will severely punish them.

Mr. Yang also said that he had met with the Finance Minister in Guangzhou again, and the authorities are considering a successor.

### Representatives of the General Labor Union Petition Again: Please Approve the Silver Dollar Price Immediately

[Central News Agency] In view of the abolition of the index-linked wage method and the change to the silver dollar-based wage method, the municipal General Labor Union noted that due to the National Bank's failure to approve the silver dollar price and the skyrocketing black market price of silver dollars, labor and management were unable to comply, leading to repeated disputes and greatly affecting social order. The ninth meeting of the board of directors and supervisors of the association recently resolved to appoint standing directors and supervisors Fang Rusheng, Sun Jinghu, and five others to visit Director Chen of the Bureau in person after the meeting to seek remedial measures, but there was no result. Disputes caused by salary payments at various factories continued to arise. Yesterday (the 18th), the association again sent Fang Rusheng, Ye Xianggao, and others to visit Director Chen Baotai, requesting that he quickly forward the request to the National Bank to approve the silver dollar price for the purpose of paying wages. Otherwise, he should request the management to directly issue silver dollars in accordance with Article 3 of the regulations to resolve the disputes.

(Another report) In view of the fact that the city has entered a state of war and the military authorities have made complete preparations for the defense of the suburbs, and that this city is the industrial center of the country with numerous factories, the General Labor Union believes that all workers should remember that factories are national production fortresses and the place where workers live. If petty criminals or robbers and traitors take the opportunity to sabotage, they must use the power of their organization to strike. Yesterday, the association issued a notice to all 560 labor unions under its jurisdiction in the city, urging them to earnestly assist the public security authorities to ensure the safety of factories and maintain production order. They should also quickly follow the advice of the authorities and mobilize the organization of self-defense teams to cooperate with wartime work and stabilize the local area.

### Shanghai's Atmosphere Changes Greatly: Citizens Automatically Conserve: Few People Inquire About Expensive Vegetables, Silk, and Woolen Fabrics

[This newspaper report] Since the magnificent Battle of Shanghai began in the suburbs, the social order in the city has become more disciplined. The legendary life that used to permeate everywhere has completely disappeared. The speculative market is unprecedentedly deserted, and prices are relatively stable. The large houses and mansions in the western district are locked up all day long. The congestion of telephones and vehicles in the office area before noon has been greatly improved. All schools, large companies, and commercial storefronts have added protective wooden boards to their glass windows. Ordinary households are also rushing to install fences or barbed wire at the walls and alley entrances. Around 9:00 PM, pedestrians on the street hurry home, and the rich and powerful who squander money in entertainment venues are extremely rare. Under a wartime atmosphere, the extravagant and dissolute Shanghai style that has persisted for more than a century has clearly bid farewell to the "Ten-Mile Foreign Concession."

In terms of the daily life of ordinary citizens, most families have now automatically developed thrifty habits. According to surveys conducted by reporters at various small vegetable markets in recent days, the consumption of fish, meat, seafood, and other more expensive vegetables has decreased significantly, while the sales of pickled vegetables and salted fish tofu have been very good. A large number of fashion stores on the central section of Avenue Joffre, such as Jinlan, Kangle, Yamei, Lvxia, Fuxing, and Guohua, have almost all dismantled their large display windows. The clerks are shouting themselves hoarse, yelling on the display stands that silk and woolen fabrics are being sold at a 70% discount, just like a used clothing auction on the stone road, and the price is even cheaper. However, very few people inquire. Most citizens are currently not interested in clothing, and the sales of summer-appropriate white leather shoes, handbags, and other accessories this year have been bleak. Most of the Western-style clothing industry has not seen a customer visit in the past two or three weeks.

Theater Box Office Sales Dismal: Drama Is Expected to Rise

The movie industry is also in an unprecedented slump. Due to poor box office sales, the Western film market is currently only circulating old copies. Old movies such as "Bathing Beauty" and "The Gunfighter" are still frequently screened in first-run theaters. Domestic film producers have stopped production because the heads of various factories have mostly left Shanghai for Hong Kong. New movies cannot be made, and a large number of "stars," such as Shi Hui and Zhang Fa, have formed drama troupes to perform dramas at the Lyceum Theatre. It is expected that drama will rise again in this city for a period of time.

As for Peking opera performances, they are no longer as brilliant as in the past. A large number of leading actors have not appeared for a long time, and theaters are trying their best to attract audiences with half-price tickets, but they stop the show and close the curtains at 8:00 PM every night, which is quite disappointing. Cheng Xiaofei and Cheng Xiaoting, who are famous for performing comic dialogues, have recently seen a sharp decline in their income due to a sharp reduction in private performances. They have jointly established a consignment store and are accepting introductions of goods for sale to businesses and users on the radio. They rely on extracting commissions for their living.

### Silver Dollar Black Market Prices Higher: Nickel Coin Trading Active

[This newspaper report] Yesterday's silver dollar market was at a standstill because the central bank had not yet posted prices, and businesses could not operate. The number of "silver bulls" on the streets is increasing day by day, and underground transactions are becoming more active. The black market price is rising higher and higher. In the afternoon, it was heard that it had risen to above the "flat head" U.S. dollar.

The silver coin market is becoming more active. Due to the rising gold banknotes, people are collecting them out of curiosity, and the market is quite prosperous. 20-cent coins rose from 300,000 to 400,000, and in the afternoon rose to 350,000 to 450,000. 10-cent coins rose from 120,000 to 170,000 to 150,000 to 200,000. 5-cent coin transactions were rare, with buying at 70,000 and selling at 100,000, an increase of about 30% compared to the previous day. Silver dime trading also turned active, with buying at 900,000 and selling at 1 million.

The gold-silver exchange rate narrowed by another 2 yuan. The morning price was 45.48, and the afternoon price was as low as 44.47. One type of currency moved slightly to 43.46, two types of currency traded at 45.48, and miscellaneous foreign currency traded as low as 48.53.

The gold-banknote exchange rate also narrowed by 2 yuan, from 52 yuan to 54 yuan, to as low as 50 yuan to 53 yuan in the afternoon.

The banknote-silver exchange rate narrowed by another 5 to 7 cents. In the morning, one type of currency traded at 8.5 yuan to 9 yuan, and in the afternoon it was as low as 8.3 yuan to 8.8 yuan. Paired currency also traded at 9 yuan to 9.5 yuan, and as low as 8.5 yuan to 9 yuan. Two types of currency also fell to 8.8 yuan to 9.3 yuan. Miscellaneous foreign currency initially traded at 9.5 yuan to 10 yuan, and then slightly fell to 9.3 yuan to 9.8 yuan.

For gold ornaments exchanged for silver dollars, shops still posted prices of 48 yuan to 50 yuan, while factory bars were an additional 2 yuan, for 50 yuan to 55 yuan.

### No Rice Arriving at Market; Prices Continue to Soar; Limited Trade in Coarse Grains and Flour; Edible Oil Finally Declines Yesterday

Rice: Due to the continued rise in gold and silver prices outside the market, rice prices have continued to climb, resulting in increasingly sluggish trading. Northern Market’s Superior White Rice and Thin-Husked Indica Rice both reached an exorbitant 74 million yuan, a staggering increase of 16 million yuan from the previous day. In the Southern Rice Market, Superior White Rice was priced at 72 million yuan and Thin-Husked Rice at 73 million yuan, increases of 12 to 13 million yuan from the previous day. Other varieties were offered in smaller quantities, and neither market received any new arrivals yesterday. Retail prices for Superior White Rice have reached as high as 110 million yuan.

Coarse Grains: Trading slowed yesterday, with only scattered transactions within the street. Prices also rose due to the increase in gold and silver. Shuangyuan soybeans traded at 33 million yuan, up 2 million yuan; Zhangbaling corn at 8.8 million yuan; and Jiujiang sesame at 44 million yuan, with slight volume. Raw peanuts from Linhuaiguan were priced at 63.8 million yuan.

Flour: Prices were initially firm, then weakened. The opening prices were far from the gold and paper money exchange rate. Sellers tried hard to close the gap, leading to high asking prices and sluggish trading. "Warship" brand opened at 14.85 million yuan and closed in the afternoon at 14.3 million yuan, still an increase of over 20% compared to the previous day. "Old Car" brand was priced at 16.5 million yuan and "Dafa" at 15.4 million yuan.

Oil Market: After consecutive days of surging prices, retail investors stopped buying at high levels, leaving the market very weak. Prices fell slightly yesterday. Factory soybean oil opened in the morning still above 200 million yuan but retreated to 187 million yuan in the afternoon, with some transactions. Raw oil declined slightly, with factory raw oil priced at 198 million yuan. Raw vegetable oil was scarce, with prices rising initially in the morning market but retreating by the afternoon, closing at 165 million yuan.

### Under the Shadow of Widespread Buying Interest, the Gold Market Boils with Rising Prices; Gold Shops Suspend Quotations Again

[Report from this Newspaper] The gold market continued its upward trend yesterday. With cash from other locations flowing back and Central Bank loans being issued in large quantities, ample speculative capital flooded the gold and paper money markets. Under the shadow of widespread buying interest, trading became increasingly chaotic. The market once again reached its daily limit, with quoted prices as high as 5.5296 billion yuan, but there was no supply to meet the demand, and trading remained suspended. Outside the market, prices surged unstoppably, opening at 5.5 billion and 5.8 billion yuan in the morning, and approaching the 6 billion yuan mark. Afternoon prices soared to 5.8 billion and 6.1 billion yuan. Near midday, the Central Bank commissioned Dadecheng to sell gold at 5.8 billion yuan without limitation, selling a total of 380 large bars. In the afternoon, with people's spirits high and the price increases seemingly endless, the price once exceeded the 6 billion yuan mark, reaching as high as 6.2 billion and 6.5 billion yuan, ultimately closing at 6 billion and 6.3 billion yuan. The Central Bank continued to sell gold at 6 billion and 5.8 billion yuan, but only for transactions between banks, resulting in no takers. Consequently, the price jumped another 900 million yuan compared to the previous day.

The rise in the U.S. dollar outside the market was slightly less pronounced, opening at 10.5 million and 11.5 million yuan in the morning, and rising to 11.3 million and 11.8 million yuan at the midday close. In the afternoon, demand exceeded supply, with prices reaching as high as 12 million and 12.5 million yuan, ultimately closing at 11.5 million and 12 million yuan, an increase of 1.8 million yuan from the previous day.

Due to the drastic fluctuations in gold prices, making it impossible to balance supply and demand, gold shops have once again suspended price quotations after only recently reopening.

### Yarn and Cloth Continue Towards New Heights

[Report from China United News Agency] In the cotton yarn market, financial goods outside the market are showing a strong upward trend, and people are anticipating further increases, and the market is still actively buying, market prices continue toward new heights. 42-count "Blue Phoenix" reached 1.89 billion yuan, 32-count "Silver Moon" 1.45 billion yuan, 21-count "Double Horse" 1.16 billion yuan, 20-count "Tiannu" 1.16 billion yuan, and 16-count "Guangming" 920 million yuan.

In the cotton cloth market, prices continued to rise towards new heights yesterday. While nominally stable, the increases are similar to those of goods outside the market. "Dragon Head" fine cloth opened at 17.6 million yuan and closed at 18.4 million yuan in the afternoon, while "Four Gentlemen" serge opened at 18 million yuan and closed at 17.8 million yuan in the afternoon.

### National Bank Allocates 5,000 Bales of Yarn in Exchange for 50,000 Tons of Taiwanese Coal to Alleviate Coal Panic in the City

[Report from Huadong News Agency] According to a responsible official at the National Bank, the bank has purchased a total of 5,000 bales of cotton yarn from private yarn factories, which will be shipped to Taiwan in exchange for Taiwanese coal to alleviate the coal shortage in Shanghai. Each bale of yarn will be exchanged for ten tons of coal, for a total of 50,000 tons. The cotton yarn has already begun to be transported to Taiwan, and the Taiwanese coal will soon be shipped to Shanghai.

### Unit Stamps Eagerly Sought After, Over 80 Billion Yuan Worth Mostly Sold

[Report from this Newspaper] According to the post office, since the issuance of unit stamps on the 16th, because they are not affected by devaluation and can be purchased in large quantities and used at any time, companies, firms, and organizations with a large volume of daily mail have rushed to purchase them. As of yesterday morning, over 211,000 stamps have been issued, valued at over 80 billion Gold Yuan, and most have already been sold. However, the post office urges the public to note that, in addition to ordinary letters, airmail, registered mail, and express mail require a unit stamp for that category of mail, plus one ordinary letter unit stamp, to be properly mailed.

[Another Report] According to the post office, land routes for communication between the city and other areas have been completely cut off. Water transport is subject to delays due to the scarcity of ships. Postal transport relies entirely on airmail. The public is urged to use airmail as much as possible for safe and rapid delivery. The Postal Administration accepts outgoing mail until 8 PM each night, but internal processing takes time, so the public is urged to submit mail early.

### Arson Motivated by Resentment Over Rental Dispute; Husband and Wife Sentenced to Imprisonment

[Report from this Newspaper] Ding Zhijun and his wife, Ding Wang Xiuying, previously rented half a shop at 86 Ren'an Street from Xu Quanshou to operate a tailor shop. Subsequently, they were involved in a lawsuit with Xu over a housing dispute, and the court ordered them to vacate the premises by March 7 of this year. Ding harbored malicious intentions and moved his apprentice and furniture out on the afternoon of March 4. Ding and his wife then returned to stay overnight. The next morning, taking advantage of the neighbors being asleep, they set fire to the house by placing combustible materials under the bamboo floorboards and fled. Xu and his wife, sleeping upstairs, smelled smoke and fire and discovered the fire downstairs. They hurriedly put on clothes and fled. Xu then risked entering the house to salvage belongings, but the fire was too intense, and as he turned to flee, the door frame collapsed, crushing Xu and burning him to death. Police investigation determined that Ding and his wife were highly suspected and, after many efforts, arrested them and transferred them to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. Yesterday, the District Court sentenced each of them to seven years in prison.

### Citizens May Suffer Disaster; Red Cross Willing to Provide Assistance

### "Refugees" in Hong Kong Reach Saturation Point!

— Qing Yun

With war raging across the motherland, Hong Kong has become a haven for the wealthy. The situation is strikingly similar to the early days of the Second Sino-Japanese War twelve years ago.

Following the abandonment of Nanjing and the push towards Shanghai, as the defense of the city looms, Shanghai's wealthy are desperately fleeing, even if it means bearing the unpleasant label of "refugee." Their destination is Hong Kong, once considered a paradise before the war. The roar of aircraft fills the skies above the small island, with civil aviation planes weaving through the air without pause, constantly disturbing the nerves of Hong Kong's three million residents. From the first light of dawn until late at night, and then into another early morning, the noise never stops. The once desolate and quiet Kai Tak Airport has become a bustling city.

However, despite the influx of refugees, there is little evidence of poverty. They are dressed in the latest and most elaborate fashions, adorned with precious jewelry. Their luggage is piled high, like small hills, and they wear smiling faces and have well-nourished complexions. It hardly seems fitting to call them "refugees."

With Hong Kong's population already saturated, the addition of so many "high-class refugees" makes the housing problem even more acute. Unless you have a well-connected friend, you can forget about finding a room in a hotel. As a result, construction is booming throughout the city, with projects being completed at a pace never before seen in Hong Kong's history.

The arrival of the "refugees" has led to a surge in food prices. Combined with the lean season between harvests and a reduction in rice shipments from the mainland, this has further driven up the price of rice. Xue rice has risen to fifty-four or five yuan per unit, and the prices of other commodities such as firewood, charcoal, cooking oil, and vegetables are also rising steadily.

Gold Rush

Like a bolt from the blue, the Hong Kong government suddenly announced a ban on the buying and selling of gold and private ownership of it in mid-April, to take effect immediately. This plunged Hong Kong into turmoil, shaking the city. The financial market was thrown into chaos, with people scrambling to respond. Gold shops closed their doors. However, the gold rush subsided within a few days. It became known that the Hong Kong government had unspoken reasons for issuing the ban.

Britain is a member of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF accused the Hong Kong government of being a major center for gold smuggling and that gold prices were far exceeding IMF regulations. Under this pressure, the Hong Kong government issued the ban to, "on the surface" at least, fulfill its obligations as a member. However, this was merely a formality, as enforcement was another matter. As the Financial Secretary said, "The government has no intention of interfering if residents use gold to build houses or airplanes."

Currently, gold futures and spot sales are flourishing, with prices even higher than before the ban. However, the consequence of this gold rush is the devaluation of the Hong Kong dollar.

Summer Scene

The weather in the South is always a little ahead of other places. Although it is still late spring, it already feels like summer in Hong Kong. It is not that Hong Kong people are prescient, but rather that the weather is too hot, and people have already changed their wardrobes. The once dormant beaches have revived. Repulse Bay and the waters off North Point are crowded with people on holidays. Department stores are filled with swimwear, still in the same bright red and green floral patterns, with styles that have not changed much from previous years. Women's styles are still just a pair of bra cups and a pair of bikini bottoms. Recently, new swimming aids have arrived, including webbed gloves and fins. The gloves are shaped like duck feet, while the fins resemble fish tails. There are also rubber goggles, which were not seen last year. These are likely new products, with surprisingly high prices.

Colorful Hawaiian shirts have been abandoned this year, replaced by maroon Hawaiian shirts paired with gray or colorless trousers and black and white two-toned leather shoes, transforming the youth of Hong Kong into "pathetic green youths." Indian silk shops have been busy moving goods for days. Fabrics for women's clothing are flooding in, keeping the young ladies busy and the gentlemen exasperated!

Dance halls have entered a quiet period and do not feel particularly lively. The same is true for cinemas, which are not showing any blockbuster movies. Film companies are planning their autumn offensive after the weather cools down.

### Prices Under the Fire of War

(Special report from this Newspaper) The rapid rise in prices during wartime is an inevitable phenomenon. However, the extent of this rise varies. Some prices increase dramatically, while others increase only slightly. Generally speaking, the prices of food, fuel, and daily necessities will rise sharply, while the prices of expensive clothing and luxury goods will rise far less. This has been the case in all previous wars in Shanghai. For example, after the start of the August 13 Incident in 1937, the price of rice in Shanghai rose from 1.16 yuan per斗(dou) on August 1 to 1.50 yuan per 斗(dou) on August 15. Coal balls rose even more dramatically, from 1.35 yuan per担(dan) on August 1 to 2 yuan per 担(dan) on August 15, and then to 3 yuan per 担(dan) on September 1. Given the stability of prices and currency values at the time, such a rapid price increase was unprecedented.

Reasons for the Rise

The rise in prices under the threat of war is due to a variety of factors. In summary, these include: First, the massive military spending leads to rapid currency inflation and a decline in currency value. Second, general public panic and instability lead to the scramble for essential supplies, especially food and fuel. Third, speculators hoard and monopolize goods, creating chaos for their own profit. Fourth, some farmland is turned into battlefields, and factories cannot produce goods, creating supply problems. Fifth, external transportation is disrupted, the exchange of goods is lost, many unnecessary goods cannot be transported out, and the supply of necessary goods is reduced, causing the price to rise and fall.

August 13th Precedent

Let's take the example of the August 13 Incident in 1937. According to statistics, food prices increased by 10.28% from August to October, fuel prices increased by 33.72%, while clothing prices actually decreased by 1.12%. This shows that during wartime, people can only focus on maintaining basic sustenance, with little time to care about clothing.

Fuel Takes the Lead

After the war approached Shanghai this time, according to unofficial statistics, food and fuel prices rose the most, with fuel prices leading the way. This is also due to natural causes. Regarding food, the city has ample reserves, and transporting it back home is relatively convenient. However, fuel is the main issue, and coal is bulky and heavy and must be transported from afar, making the supply far less convenient than food, so prices have risen the most.

Salted Fish and Fences

The rise in prices of some items is very abnormal. According to people familiar with the business community, the rise in the prices of several items in the last half month has far exceeded that of food and fuel. One is salted yellow croaker. Recently, dried salted yellow croaker can be seen everywhere on the streets of Shanghai, or on balconies facing the street. Almost every household has several pounds, and the total sales volume is considerable. A month ago, in the Sixteenth Shop area, the center of the salted fish industry, one silver dollar could buy more than 20 pounds. Later, at the most expensive time, it could only buy five pounds. Now the price has fallen again. On the other hand, salted pork and ham are not selling well. The situation of lining up in front of ham shops early in the morning and being limited to one pound per person at the time of price controls has not been seen again. This is because they are too expensive. Although they can be stored, people cannot afford to eat them. Therefore, they are far less popular with the petty bourgeoisie than salted yellow croaker. Secondly, ropes have risen incredibly. This is because the military needs ropes for construction, and people who are preparing for emergencies and escaping also need ropes. Therefore, although this item cannot be eaten, it has become a target for speculation by some merchants, and the price has risen sharply. Another item is timber. Just look at the clanging of hammers as people rush to install fences and gates in various alleys, and you can imagine what is happening.

No One Asks

In addition to new cars and expensive radios, imported Western suits are also among the least sought-after items. These were the objects that people rushed to buy when price controls were first lifted last year. How quickly they have been neglected! Now, there are stalls lining the streets, and many of them are selling expensive clothing materials. These are the goods that employees of the large shops which have very little business have been forced to move to the roadside to sell. A set of clothing material often sells for only six or seven silver dollars, which is equivalent to half a 担(dan) of rice before the war. The prices are cheap, but there are not many buyers, because the problem of food is too important. With an uncertain future, and unknown how to make a living, the idea of making a new suit is naturally dismissed.

The Silver Dollar Problem

If calculated in silver dollars, the current prices are not high. For example, rice cost 12 yuan before the war. Other things are of course unnecessary to mention. Before the war, a Western meal in the central district cost 1.23 yuan, while in the western district it cost 1.67 yuan. But now the general price of a Western meal, converted into silver dollars, is only 70 or 80 cents. But the problem is: how many silver dollars can people earn in a month? An ordinary public education employee earns about five yuan. An employee in a production department who can earn 20 silver dollars a month is doing well. Before the war, an elementary school teacher could earn 40 or 50 yuan, and it was not uncommon to earn a hundred yuan a month. Compared to that, the value of one silver dollar today has risen many times over. Spending it is naturally a serious matter.

### Unable to Afford Medical Treatment, Life is in the Balance

A Reader Appeals for Help from Philanthropists

To the Editor: I venture to implore you to disclose my unfortunate circumstances in a corner of your newspaper.

I am a servant at the Mei Ya Photo Studio, living in a small room on the second floor of 106 Kaifeng Road in this city. Every month, I bring home all of my salary to support my elderly mother and young daughter. Last year, I developed a malignant tumor in my abdomen, which has been gradually enlarging and causing excruciating pain. Because I have no savings, I cannot afford medical treatment. However, as the illness has worsened, at the beginning of this month, I had to ask for leave to seek medical help and borrowed more than ten silver dollars from relatives and neighbors for medical expenses. I am now staying in Room 77 on the third floor of Zhongshan Hospital.

The doctor told me that my illness cannot be cured with just a few days in the hospital. I need surgery, and because my blood is depleted, I need a blood transfusion before the surgery. This blood transfusion alone costs 50 silver dollars. Alas! How can someone like me, who lives hand to mouth, come up with such a huge sum of money? Moreover, the daily hospital fee is 1.2 yuan. I have asked the hospital authorities to reduce the fee, but I have been disappointed.

If I do not treat my illness, the doctor says that I have at most two months left to live. Alas! My death is not a pity, but how will my elderly mother and young daughter, who depend on me for survival, live in the future? Therefore, with nowhere else to turn, I still want to fight for my last breath, struggling to implore you to disclose my plight and appeal to philanthropists for sympathy and assistance. I also hope that you can ask the Zhongshan Hospital authorities to make an exception and reduce the various fees so that a dying person can have hope for life. If the lives of my family of three can be saved, then all the kind people and you, sir, I will honor in life and remember with gratitude in death. Respectfully wishing you peace.

Sincerely,

Cui Jieguang (Patient)

### Legal Clarifications

Answered primarily by Attorney Tang Mingshi

[Question from Mr. Cheng Xiaotian] (1) In a marital quarrel, if the wife takes flight with the husband's real estate deeds, can the husband file a lawsuit with the local court? (2) If both parties engage in mutual wrestling, resulting in injuries, can one spouse sue the other for the crime of physical assault? (3) If a marital relationship is strained and, at the wife's request and with relatives present, the husband provides a certain amount of grain for sustenance, can the wife then sue the husband for abandonment?

[Answer] (1) If the couple does not divide their property, then the couple's property is jointly owned. Therefore, the chapter on theft in the Criminal Law includes a provision exempting spouses from punishment (Article 324 of the Criminal Law). (2) The crime of spousal assault can be established, but minor cases are not prosecuted unless reported. (3) Since sustenance grain has been provided, there is no act of abandonment; however, whether the alimony provided is sufficient for sustenance must be determined based on local living conditions and the family's financial situation.

### Diplomas Gone Without a Trace, Earnestly Seeking Return

To the Esteemed Editor: I am a student at National Wusong Merchant Marine College, having graduated from St. John's High School during the enemy-puppet regime. Last summer, I received a notice from the college to submit a high school diploma that had been inspected and stamped by the Bureau of Education for submission to the Ministry of Education for verification. From last summer to this spring, I made countless trips before finally receiving the diploma. Unexpectedly, on the 29th of last month, while having lunch in the dining hall of the maritime college, the diploma I had placed in my raincoat pocket vanished in the blink of an eye. I have searched for several days without success and am extremely anxious. Although the diploma is of no concern to outsiders, it is of utmost importance to me personally. Therefore, I earnestly request that you kindly publish this notice. If any kind person finds the diploma (diploma number is Yue Bu Zi No. 2), I hope they will return it. I will be eternally grateful. Please accept my best wishes. Respectfully submitted, Reader Li Qien. May 10th. Correspondence address: c/o Xu Residence, No. 19, Lane 520, Yuyuan Road, Shanghai.

### "Land Limitation" in Guangxi

[Guilin Dispatch] At present, the land policy of land limitation and rent reduction has become a national urgency. The Guangxi Provincial authorities, from last year to this year, have made the realization of "land to the tiller" one of the most important county government policies.

Looking at the land distribution situation in this province, although large landlords may be fewer compared to other provinces, in relative terms, the phenomenon of "the rich owning fields stretching for miles, while the poor have no place to stand" is evident. In the areas along the major rivers, such as Rongxian, Guiping, and Pingnan counties, there are wealthy families with annual rents of 9,000 dan, and many others with 7,000 to 8,000 dan or around 1,000 dan; in Guixian and Yulin areas, there are large landlords who do not even know how much grain they have accumulated. Due to the landlords' cunning manipulation and the ineffective implementation by those in charge of land administration, the work faces numerous difficulties.

The general situation is as follows: (1) "Land" and "tax" are disconnected, making contract renewal difficult to implement. The implementation of the land limitation policy must first involve land surveying, but previous land declarations in the localities were poorly handled, leading to chaotic tax administration. As a result, one does not know what their tax is, nor does one family know how many mu of land they own. "Land" and "tax" are thus disconnected, making land sales difficult, and contract renewal cannot be negotiated. (2) Landlords and wealthy gentry manipulate local power, making rent reduction and land limitation very difficult to handle. This year, after the province implemented land limitation, landlords saw the opportunity to cause trouble, trying to evade the policy by dividing households and occupying land, breaking large holdings into smaller ones. Rent reduction is even more difficult to implement, mainly because there are too many tenant farmers competing to cultivate the land. The land limitation work is treated as mere formality, with many places simply posting a notice to that effect. (3) No one wants to buy the landlords' land. In areas with harmonious landlord-tenant relations, such as Zhaoping and Mengshan, landlords are often willing to sell excess land, but tenant farmers, either due to poverty or hesitation, are unwilling to buy at the price. In addition, some landlords raise land prices, hindering the progress of the land limitation policy.

On the government side: local implementation is weak, land surveying contains errors and corruption, and the work of organizing land and household registers is yet to be reviewed. All of this leads to numerous obstacles in the preparatory work for land limitation.

In general, the vast majority of senators unanimously and firmly stated: "We believe that the most important thing in implementing land limitation is to organize tenant farmers and poor peasants, making them the driving force behind land reform. At the same time, the government must have the courage and determination to offend the wealthy and powerful families, consistently carry out the policy, and then land reform will not be an empty promise." They also believe that the government should strictly enforce the policy and that public officials should set an example and take the lead. The majority of senators are eager to see land limitation realized. The senators come from the people, and these are the opinions of the people. The will of the people is where government should take advantage of this opportunity, address the actual difficulties, make bold reforms, and achieve success. The people hope for this realization, and the country needs this realization.

Why is the tea from the high mountains so good? Because when the tender leaves first emerge in the spring, the tea farmers do not pick them all, and the small buds that sprout again (called mother-and-child tea) are not picked for fear of harming the tree. In winter, the withered grass around the roots of the tea tree is turned over, and then in the following spring, when the weather is warm, it sprouts new buds. Because the mountains are high and the climate is cold, the production is later than in the plains.

Two Tests

If readers want to test the quality of tea leaves, here are two good methods: Take a clean porcelain bowl, put a small amount of tea leaves in the bowl, and brew with boiling water. After a short while, the leaves will open up, and the robust ones will float on the surface like whales swimming in the water. If you look closely, there are insect holes, shaped like small commas, that have not been eaten through, then the leaves are the best; because tea leaves from high mountains contain sweet juice, it is inevitable that there will be parasites. Since there is sweet juice, insects will not fail to eat it. The mountains are high and the soil is fertile, and the tea leaves grow thick, so in the short period of time it takes for the tea leaves to come down the mountain, the insects do not have the strength to eat through a hole. This is what makes good tea leaves. Second, there is a very simple test method: take a brewed tea leaf, pick it up, and gently tear it apart by hand. If many fine strands like lotus roots appear when the leaf breaks, then that tea is also very good.
