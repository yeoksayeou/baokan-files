### Gu Ambassador Appeals to the International Community for Assistance in Stopping the War; Otherwise, It Will Eventually Endanger World Peace

[United Press, New York, 11th] The Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, appealed on the evening of the 11th for international assistance to stop the civil war in China. In a speech accepting the Hamilton Award from Columbia University, Gu stated: "The situation in China can be used as a test of cooperation among major powers." The Hamilton Award is given to alumni or faculty members who have excelled and achieved distinction in any aspect of human endeavor, and Gu is an alumnus of the university. He stated: "Unlike the Berlin problem, no major power has openly sided with one party in the Chinese civil war. They are all free to participate in efforts to mediate and stop the war as soon as possible. This war has been delayed for too long, and if it is not resolved by immediate agreement, it will eventually endanger world peace. The leaders of international communism are realists. When free nations increasingly have a consistent and firm determination to protect their freedom and their way of life, the communists may realize that their dreams of controlling the world have become ineffective and recognize that free nations have the right to coexist with communist regimes. If this is the case, diplomats will have a better and clearer chance of success through meetings or by finding ways to resolve the major disputes that are currently dividing the major powers. It can be reasonably assumed that neither side truly hopes for war or advocates resorting to force. If this assumption is correct, then the situation in China can be used as a touchstone for testing cooperation among major powers. China is the key to Asia. For the sake of maintaining world peace, all countries that sincerely advocate peace should do their utmost to assist the Chinese government in its efforts to resolve the Chinese war. The outcome of the Chinese conflict can determine the shape of things to come. If the CCP is not an instrument of international communism, but a true Chinese patriot, and loves the freedom and sovereignty of China as much as its compatriots, and if the CCP truly desires the happiness of the Chinese people, as they have always claimed, then the CCP cannot completely ignore peace proposals. If the CCP is truly like this, then they cannot shirk the full responsibility for the continuation of the war in China."

Gu also said that China is a "major battlefield in the world's fight against aggressive communism." He briefly listed the world's tense situations, saying that the Berlin crisis is just one of them, and Korea is another. "In addition to the Cold War, there are actual wars in China, Greece, and the Middle East." Gu continued: "Armed conflicts and military operations are taking place in several countries in Southeast Asia, especially in Malaya and Indonesia." He pointed out that the inherent causes of these disputes clearly show that international communism has the ambition to realize a world revolution and establish a communist world.

Before Gu Weijun called for a diplomatic solution to the Chinese civil war, Nanjing telecommunications said that the Chinese government had requested the assistance of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in possible peace talks between the KMT and the CCP.

### Stories of Brave Air Force Pilots Taking Risks; Escaping the Jaws of Death with Shoe Heel Fake Stamps

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Air Force pilots supporting ground army combat have produced a series of stories of self-sacrifice and risk-taking.

(1) Ke Tengjiao, a pilot of Fujian origin from the Philippines, was forced to land in the bandit阵(zhèn) after his plane was shot down near Xuzhou and was captured and taken to the vicinity of Yanzhou. He calculated that it would take five days to reach the National Army area, so he secretly left two steamed buns under a stone by the river every day under the supervision of the bandits. After four days, he went to check, but all the buns were gone. He knew that the bandits were closely watching him. After a few days, he saved four more buns and escaped from the toilet hole while going to the toilet and fled south. He hid in graves during the day and ran south by observing the stars at night. After five days, he managed to reach the defense area with the support of four buns without disturbing any bandit-occupied villages.

(2) The son of the famous athlete Ma John, who was captured in the same area as the above-mentioned Ke Tengjiao. He was shot down and parachuted into the bandit army in northern Jiangsu and captured. He has now also escaped and returned.

(3) Li Lenian, a paratrooper who was captured in the Xi'an war zone, escaped danger with a piece of rubber from his shoe. He usually liked to engrave seals, so he used a small knife to engrave Peng Dehuai's name and rank on the rubber heel of his shoe, creating a fake mission certificate. He crossed the Huanglong Mountains and returned south. With this fake certificate, he also rescued an army regimental commander who had been captured. The transmission is related to inviting the United States and other countries to mediate the KMT-CCP war. Luo did not respond.

It is reported that the three demands of the Communist side are: The National Army in the city must lay down their weapons, all weapons must be handed over to the Communist side, and the lives of the National Army that accept the above conditions will be guaranteed safe.

### Zhang Qun Officially Dispels Rumors in Nanjing; Bai Chongxi and Cheng Qian's Attitudes Are Open and Upright, Completely Consistent with the Central Government's Current Policies

[Special Dispatch from Chengdu, 12th] At the political affairs meeting on the morning of the 12th, Political Committee Member Zhang Qun reported on his recent trip to Central China. Zhang stated that various rumors circulating about Central China were proven absolutely untrue after his personal meetings with Bai Chongxi and Cheng Qian. Their opinions are entirely consistent with those of the Central Government. Bai even stated "prepare for war to seek peace," which aligns with the President's intention to be capable of both war and peace. Furthermore, the matter of Zhang's re-visit to Wuhan has been decided to be temporarily postponed.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 12th] Zhang Qun formally denied the United Press Nanjing dispatch of the 11th, which alleged that he was conveying Bai Chongxi and Cheng Qian's demands for President Chiang's resignation and transfer of all power. He stated that the matter was purely a rumor, completely unfounded. Bai and Cheng made no such demands.

Zhang replied with great surprise, stating: "This is an unfounded rumor, clearly containing malicious attempts to sow discord between the President and senior generals, even shaking the morale of troops at the front and confusing public opinion." Secretary-General Zhang Qun further told the reporter: "During my visit to Wuhan and Changsha, I had extensive talks with Bai and Cheng. Their views on the current situation were very pure and far-sighted, loyal and patriotic, and highly admirable. Since the defeat in the Huaihai Campaign, the situation in Central China has naturally become tense. Although the military authorities are actively preparing for war and have made meticulous arrangements, the local people still feel uneasy. This kind of emotion is very common. Bai and Cheng are determined to adhere to the policy of only preparing for war to seek peace and not forgetting war while talking about peace. Furthermore, they strongly advocate that unity from top to bottom and throughout the country is essential for any solution, whether for peace or war. The attitudes of the two gentlemen are very open and upright, and there is no difference between them and the Central Government's current policies. This has already been proven by facts, without the need for further explanation."

[Special Dispatch from Hankou, 12th] Hubei Chairman Zhang Dulun stated: "After Mr. Zhang Yuejun's visit to Hankou and return to Nanjing, he reported the real situation of the region to the central government. According to a telegram from Zhang himself from Nanjing, President Chiang expressed great satisfaction with the current situation in Central China. As for rumors that Zhang will visit Hankou again, he has not heard anything about it so far."

### Actively Constructing the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway

In today's war-torn times, we are pleased to hear news of construction: the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is currently under active construction. This is indeed a welcome sound in a desolate valley. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has experienced many twists and turns and unexpected obstacles since its reconstruction began in October 1946, almost leading to the cessation of the project midway. Thanks to the efforts of the local authorities in Sichuan Province and the support of the Ministry of Communications, the road construction was able to continue. Previous rumors that the road had no funds from January of this year have been denied by the authorities. According to recent reliable information, the national general budget for this year has incorporated the required domestic and foreign funds for the road's three-year completion plan into the budget expenditure. The Ministry of Communications is continuing to allocate funds based on this budget. Not only has the road construction not been halted, but it is also possible to complete it ahead of schedule. This is fortunate for Sichuan and marks a new era in the unified transportation of the Southwest. We are very pleased to hear this news of peaceful construction!

Sichuan is known as the "Land of Abundance," with a large population and abundant resources. However, within its 404,000 square kilometer area, the lack of a railway connection has affected various construction projects, which is indeed a regrettable matter. The people of Sichuan took the lead in starting the revolution in the late Qing Dynasty for the railway issue, leading to the Xinhai Revolution. In the eyes of the people of Sichuan, the railway is the hub of all economic and cultural activities and the nerve center for the survival and development of 70 million people. The people of Sichuan have been looking forward to having a railway.

During the Anti-Japanese War, when the national government was in Chongqing, the wartime capital, it planned to resume the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, but it was suspended halfway due to a lack of materials and funds. After the victory and return to peace, Chairman Chiang, in his farewell message to the people of Sichuan, affirmed that he was determined to build a railway for Sichuan Province and instructed the Ministry of Communications to complete the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway within two years, with 26 billion yuan allocated from the national treasury. At that time, the people of Sichuan were excited when they heard this. Unexpectedly, in 1946, there was no news of the allocation of funds, and the people of Sichuan felt disappointed. Last year, the Ministry of Communications included the construction cost of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway in the budget, which was approved to be 40 billion yuan, 14 billion yuan higher than the estimate in 1946. Despite the continuous progress of the road construction, the project almost came to a standstill due to the lack of materials and insufficient funds. The authorities of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Construction, in desperation, negotiated a loan with a French banking group and achieved considerable results. The people of Sichuan realized that raising foreign debt to build the railway might harm national interests and mostly expressed their disapproval. They yearned for the state to include the construction cost of the road in the budget or requested the central government to return 1 million dan of grain from Sichuan Province to offset the cost, using the money and grain of the people of Sichuan to build roads in Sichuan. The transportation authorities agreed in principle, but their determination and willpower were not enough, resulting in many twists and turns and setbacks. The road's bridge, tunnel, and earthwork projects have only been completed by half so far, and the completion date is still quite far away.

According to the blueprint of November 1946, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is 520 kilometers long, starting from Wuhou Temple in Chengdu and ending at Jiulongpo in Chongqing. The route passes through areas with developed industries and abundant agricultural raw materials, which will undoubtedly help Sichuan's construction. In order to cooperate with Sichuan's construction plan, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Bureau re-formulated a three-year completion plan last year, aiming to actively expedite the completion. In the first year (fiscal year), from 1948 to June 1949, the road surface engineering from Chongqing to Yongchuan will be completed. After the rails and sleepers purchased from the United States are shipped to Chongqing this year, they will be laid immediately to Zhuyangxi, and the road will be open to traffic by the end of the year. In the second year (from July this year to June 1950), the road will be open to Neijiang. In the third year (from July 1950 to June 1951), the entire line will be open to traffic. If the foreign exchange for purchasing materials can be allocated quickly and the project is quickly approved, the entire line can be opened to traffic by the end of 1950, shortening the time by half a year. Recently, the road construction has been progressing actively. If there are no more obstacles midway, it is entirely possible that the entire line will be open to traffic in July next year.

The construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway during this extraordinary period is of great significance. The help of the road construction for construction is needless to say. For the psychology of the people of Sichuan, will inevitably have great comfort and encouragement. From the process of the anti-Japanese war, Sichuan has made great contributions to the country and the nation. Without Sichuan, China would not have been able to persist in the anti-Japanese war for eight years. Today, the troops defending the Yangtze River and the Yellow River on the Huaihai battlefield are mostly strong men from Sichuan, which shows that in the ten years of the anti-Japanese war, without the loyal cooperation of the people of Sichuan, the rear could not have been so stable. The only yearning of the people of Sichuan is this railway. They have no extravagant demands, and the country should not fail them.

Now that the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is under active construction and its opening to traffic is imminent, all compatriots in the country and the people of Sichuan are eager to see it completed as soon as possible and will strive to develop it in the future, so that the railway's blood can be sublimated to the highest point!

### Adjustment of Salaries for Public School Teachers and Civil Servants: Abolition of Zonal Surcharges

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The salaries of central government civil and military officials and teachers were approved by the Executive Yuan at its 34th meeting on the 8th and will be adjusted starting this month. The payment standards for each zone have also been announced. The main difference between these new standards and the salary calculation methods of November and December last year is the abolition of the zonal surcharge method. Except for the different payment standard multipliers in each zone, the calculation method has not changed. Taking Nanchang in the third zone as an example, if a civil servant's base salary is 400 yuan, their actual income calculated using the new standard will be 1,770 yuan. The calculation method can be explained as follows: (1) The initial base is 60 yuan. (2) 20% of the 240 yuan from 61 yuan to 300 yuan. (3) 10% of the 100 yuan from 301 yuan to 400 yuan. The sum of these three items (1), (2), and (3) is then multiplied by the payment standard multiplier of 15 for Nanchang in the third zone, which is the 1,770 yuan to be received.

### Regulations for Mutual Aid Groups for Conscripted Soldiers

— Continued

C. Organization and Work of Mutual Aid Groups for Military Service

10. Each county (city) should, at the same time as organizing the conscripted soldier teams, organize mutual aid groups for military service. The formation of the mutual aid groups for military service and their personnel are as follows: (1) Township (Town/District) Direct Group - Composed of township (town/district) people's representatives, selecting solid and reliable families in the entire township (town/district) to serve as group members, with the number selected being equal to the number of "bao" (a local administrative unit) under their jurisdiction. The township (town/district) head serves concurrently as the group leader. (2) Bao Direct Group - Composed of solid and reliable families in the entire bao as group members, with the number selected being equal to the number of "jia" (a subunit of "bao") under their jurisdiction. The bao head serves concurrently as the group leader. (3) Each jia is divided into three subgroups, with each subgroup having at least three members. If there are fewer than three, it should be combined with a neighboring jia. First Subgroup - Composed of family members of soldiers serving in the military (excluding wealthy families). Second Subgroup - Composed of conscripted soldiers from the team. Third Subgroup - Composed of able-bodied men aged 18 to 45 from families without soldiers serving in the military, but wealthy families, regardless of whether they have soldiers serving in the military or able-bodied men, should be members of this subgroup, except for those already selected as members of the township, town, or district direct group. For each of the subgroups listed above, the members shall publicly elect one person to be the group leader.

11. The county (city) mutual aid groups for military service should use the jia as the practical unit and the bao as the implementing unit for mutual aid to the families of soldiers. The bao direct group should contribute as much manpower and resources as possible, bearing at least one-fifth of the total amount of mutual aid for the entire bao to subsidize impoverished families. The township (town/district) serves as the command unit and should contribute as much manpower and resources as possible from the township (town/district) direct group, bearing at least one-tenth of the total amount of mutual aid for the entire county (town/district) to subsidize impoverished bao. The county (city) serves as the planning and supervision unit and should utilize all possible preferential treatment funds to handle overall relief and preferential treatment. If there is a military service association, it should assist or be responsible for handling these matters.

12. The standards for mutual aid to the families of soldiers are as follows: (1) Families with ample means or the ability to support themselves independently are exempt from mutual aid. (2) Families with sufficient land to cultivate but lacking manpower should be provided with volunteer assistance for cultivation. (3) Families without land to cultivate and without the ability to engage in industry and commerce, or whose income from industry and commerce is insufficient to maintain their livelihood, should be provided with material relief. (4) Families with very little land should be provided with both volunteer cultivation and material relief. The minimum requirement for mutual aid to the families of soldiers is to maintain their food, clothing, and shelter to prevent them from freezing and starving. Generally, the standard is 150 labor days per year for each soldier serving in the military. Those in need of material relief should also be provided with the equivalent in labor wages or rice based on the local prevailing rates, but the amount should be adjusted based on their actual needs. Mutual aid for households in urban bao should be handled according to the above provisions. Mutual aid for the families of soldiers in fortified units should be handled according to Article 18 of the Conscription Regulations during the Suppression of Rebellion.

13. The implementation procedures for volunteer cultivation are as follows: (1) At the beginning of each year, the first subgroup of each jia under each bao should submit the number of labor days needed by each member requiring assistance. The bao head should convene all the group leaders and members of each jia to review and decide on the number of labor days. (2) After review and decision, the manpower and resources of the bao direct group and the third subgroup of each jia should be assessed to determine the amount of labor days each should bear. The necessary plowing cattle, cultivators, and laborers should be assigned accordingly. (3) The timing of the volunteer labor should be determined by the member receiving the assistance. The members providing assistance should not delay or refuse on any pretext. The bao head and all the group leaders and members of the jia should jointly supervise and execute the cultivation through a division of labor. (4) If the member providing assistance is unable to provide labor due to unavoidable circumstances or if the residence of the person providing assistance and the person receiving assistance are far apart, making travel inconvenient, they should pay the local prevailing wage for a hired laborer to be used for hiring labor. (To be continued)

### Israeli and Egyptian Representatives Arrive on Rhodes Island; Armistice Negotiations Begin Today; Britain and the Jews Accept US Advice to Exercise Restraint

[Our Dispatch] New York, 12th - A broadcast from Rhodes Island reports that the Egyptian delegation has arrived here, preparing to negotiate the Palestinian armistice with Israeli authorities. The negotiations are scheduled to begin on the 13th, and the Israeli delegation is expected to arrive on the afternoon of the 12th.

[United Press, London, 12th] United Nations mediator Ralph Bunche, along with military observer group leader Riley, flew to Rhodes Island yesterday to preside over the Israeli-Egyptian armistice negotiations. An Israeli government spokesman said that Israeli forces have completely withdrawn from Egyptian territory.

[Our Dispatch] Washington, 12th - A broadcast reports that Acting Secretary of State Lovett stated that the United States has formally advised Britain, Israel, and Egypt to exercise as much restraint as possible in the Middle East, so as not to adversely affect the opportunity for Egyptian peace talks. Lovett said that this advice was issued before the Israeli forces shot down five British planes, and the same advice was subsequently issued again, because the US military deeply hopes that the Holy Land can see peace again.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 12th] The United Nations today shelved Israel's complaint against Britain in order to pave the way for negotiations on a Palestinian armistice treaty. United Nations officials intend to temporarily refrain from responding to Israel's formal request for an investigation into British activities in the Middle East. Negotiations in the Holy Land have entered a delicate stage, and due to pressure from the United States and the United Nations, Israel's attitude has slightly softened and there is no continued vigorous action.

[United Press, London, 11th] The government issued a statement tonight stating that world peace has been seriously threatened by the situation in Palestine. The United Nations Security Council has lost its power of control, and Israel is likely to violate the armistice order again in places like Jerusalem, attacking Jordanian or Iraqi forces. The Security Council should re-establish its prestige before a final resolution is reached, without any delay. The British Foreign Office is currently refraining from commenting on Israel's complaint against Britain to the Security Council, only stating that the government intends to exercise utmost patience so as not to hinder the success of the armistice negotiations between Egypt and Israel.

### Bevin Attends Cabinet Meeting, Reports on the Situation in the Holy Land; Confirms Jewish Forces Received Military Supplies from the Eastern Bloc

[Our Dispatch] London, 12th - A British Foreign Office spokesman recently stated that since the United Nations imposed an arms embargo on the Middle East, 90 percent of the military supplies illegally entering Israel have been supplied by Eastern Bloc countries, with the most coming from Czechoslovakia. The British cabinet held its first full meeting since Christmas today, and Foreign Secretary Bevin reported on the situation in the Holy Land and other international issues. It is understood that Britain, the United States, France and other countries have all obtained evidence of Czech military supplies being airlifted to Israel, but today is the first time that other Eastern Bloc countries have been mentioned. When asked whether the Soviet Union had supplied Israel with military supplies, the Foreign Office spokesman replied that the countries supplying military supplies other than Czechoslovakia could not be disclosed.

[Associated Press, London, 12th] Foreign Secretary Bevin reported to the cabinet today on the Palestinian crisis and other international issues, including the proposed North Atlantic Treaty, the European Recovery Program, and the German question. On the Palestine issue, Bevin appears to be the target of much criticism. Some Labor Party members have criticized the handling of the Middle East crisis, and are also dissatisfied with the Foreign Office's formal review of the dispute. According to the Foreign Office, the latest developments are a serious threat to the peace and stability of the entire Middle East. Labor Party members were greatly displeased that Israel actually filed a complaint against Britain in the Security Council.

### Holy Land Policy is Criticized; British Foreign Secretary's Resignation Not Approved

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 11th] Sources close to the Israeli government reported today that British Foreign Secretary Bevin has submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Attlee due to criticism from all sides regarding his policy on Palestine, but it has not been approved.

### Final Indonesian Cabinet Meeting Still Advocates Firm Resistance

Due to the Sudden Invasion by Dutch Forces, It Has Not Been Announced

[Associated Press, Batavia, 12th] Detailed records of the final cabinet meeting of the Republic of Indonesia were passed to Associated Press reporter Braman on the 12th by absolutely reliable sources. The final cabinet meeting was held on December 19th, while Dutch paratroopers were descending from the sky over Yogyakarta. The cabinet decided to call on the entire population to resolutely resist. There were a total of three announcements to the Indonesian people, which were originally intended to be broadcast nationwide by the Yogyakarta radio station, but they were never published because the Dutch forces quickly captured the radio station. The records also include four documents signed by Indonesian President Sukarno, Prime Minister Hatta, and Minister of Information Natsir, unanimously calling for resolute resistance.

### The Philippines Will Adopt Economic Sanctions Against the Netherlands

[Central News Agency, Manila, 12th] Local evening newspapers report that the Philippine government is considering implementing tough economic sanctions against the Netherlands.

### We Advocate Taking Action on the Dutch-Indonesian Issue

Chiang Ting-fu Speaks at the Security Council

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 11th] Dr. Chiang Ting-fu, the Chinese representative, made his first speech to the Security Council after returning from Paris, presenting three major requirements for a constructive solution to the Indonesian issue. He stated: At this stage, I do not intend to list the responsibilities of selling the Indonesian situation, but I would like to emphasize three major requirements for a constructive and concrete solution to this issue: (1) In order to implement the political principles of the Renville and Linggadjati agreements, the Indonesian people should be guaranteed genuine free and democratic elections; (2) Peace and order within Indonesia must be adequately guaranteed; (3) The Security Council should take more active measures in guaranteeing free and democratic elections and maintaining peace and order in the future. Chiang stated that the failure of the Indonesian issue would be a fatal blow to the United Nations, just like the September 18th Incident and the Abyssinian issue were to the League of Nations.

### The Netherlands Openly Violates Security Council Resolutions; US Representative Reprimands Back and Forth; Demands the Netherlands Establish a Free Indonesian Federation Soon

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 11th] The United States on the 11th condemned the Netherlands for "openly resisting" United Nations orders, and demanded that the Netherlands hold elections soon, establish a "genuinely free" Indonesian federation, and withdraw all Dutch troops in the East Indies within the recent months, and immediately release Indonesian leaders. US Representative Jessup reprimanded in the Security Council that the Soviet Union neither desires peace in Indonesia, nor the existence of the Republic of Indonesia, but only wants "an Indonesia controlled by a communist minority party instructed by Moscow."

Jessup pointed out that the Soviet Union's refusal to support the US proposal at the Paris conference, and the communist editorials pointing out that the Dutch police actions were a "punishment" for President Sukarno and Prime Minister Hatta's suppression of the communist rebellion in Madiun last year, all serve as clear evidence. But Jessup's most severe criticism was still directed at the Netherlands. He stated: "The Dutch authorities' refusal to immediately cease fire and their refusal to release Indonesian leaders, their failure to comply with the Security Council's orders, cannot be concealed by any excuses. The Dutch representative in the Security Council cannot absolve the Dutch government from the accusation that the Netherlands has violated the United Nations Charter." Jessup spoke with harsh words that the United States had never used against any country other than the Soviet Union in the United Nations, stating that according to the report of the Mediation Commission, it proves that the Netherlands' various activities, even before this military offensive, were aimed at subverting the Republic of Indonesia. He continued, stating that the Dutch policy not only caused "unnecessary suffering for the people," but also aimed at organizing "a pre-planned Indonesian government in which the Republican government did not participate." Jessup declared that the Netherlands will not be allowed to resolve its disputes with the Republic by force.

[Our Newspaper's Report] At around 12:15 PM yesterday, a fire broke out at the home of Wang Zhou, a resident from northern Jiangsu, located at No. 6, Lane 506, Guangzhao Road, Zhabei, due to carelessness while cooking lunch. The fire quickly spread to neighboring houses, and because the area was mostly composed of shanties built in a crude and simple manner, the fire spread rapidly, stopping only at Yutong Road. Over 600 shanties were destroyed, leaving over a thousand people homeless. At the time, fire brigades from sections 1, 2, and 3 of the Shanghai North District all rushed to the scene with their fire engines to put out the fire. The Central Fire Department also dispatched vehicles to assist. The fire was completely extinguished by 3:30 PM. During the height of the fire, Ren Caixing (44 years old, from Changzhou), a resident of No. 29, Lane 64 on the same road, was unable to escape due to illness and being bedridden.

### City Chamber of Commerce Submits Request to Central Government to Adopt Improved Industrial Loan Recommendations

The City Chamber of Commerce yesterday received a joint letter from twelve industrial trade associations, including machinery papermaking, leather manufacturing, and machinery cotton textile, stating that the government's current industrial loan methods have failed to avert the industrial loan crisis. They specifically proposed seven improved industrial loan recommendations, requesting that they be forwarded to the Executive Yuan and the Central Bank for prompt adoption. The Chamber believes that the seven improved industrial loan methods proposed are indeed necessary measures to rescue industry, and immediately sent telegrams to the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Central Bank's Discount Committee, requesting their prompt adoption. The seven recommendations are as follows: (1) In addition to the stipulated finished products and raw materials, the scope of industrial loan collateral should be expanded to include factory buildings, land, machinery, and equipment, and commercial banks and firms should be allowed to re-mortgage or re-discount with the Central Bank. (2) The Central Bank's term for re-mortgaging industrial loans should be the same as the original term of the industrial loan from the forwarding bank or firm, without reduction, but may be limited to a maximum of three months per term, and each batch of industrial loan re-mortgages may be extended for one term. (3) If the Central Bank cannot extend a re-mortgaged industrial loan that has already been extended for one term, it may order the bank or firm to recover it, but the forwarding bank or firm shall not be liable for repayment. (4) The amount of each factory's industrial loan should be based on the total value of the three-month reserve of raw materials, supplies, and fuel required by the factory, and the total amount of wages and electricity expenses for one month, and should not be limited to 8% of the total deposits of the forwarding commercial bank or firm. (5) The targets of industrial loans should be reasonably broadened to include industries such as printing, box manufacturing, and tobacco factories. (6) Finished products produced by industrial loans that have been revived and reproduced should be allowed to be purchased by each factory on a monthly basis at cost price if sales are sluggish. (7) When factories in various industries require order loans, the actual needs should be carefully considered and loans should be granted for orders.

### Emergency Industrial Loans for Small Factories: Screening Committee to be Established Soon; Applications Can Be Accepted Starting Next Week

According to Mr. Lin Chongyong, all preparatory work can be completed within this week, and applications can be accepted starting next week. The Loan Screening Committee will be established soon. In addition to the Discount Committee members, there will also be representatives from the industrial sector participating, responsible for reviewing loan applications. The nature of this loan will, in principle, adopt a credit loan system with a term of one month, without the need to mortgage machinery, finished products, or raw materials, to take into account the difficulties of small factories. The amount of the loan will be determined based on the number of workers actually engaged in production by each factory.

### "It's the Fox Demon!" Everyone Looks at Each Other, Losing Color; Strange Fire at the Dazhong Bookstore, Police Bureau Investigates the Truth

[Our News Report] At 8:15 PM last night, a pile of old Lingbao newspapers stored next to the escalator on the second floor of the Dazhong Bookstore at No. 230 Fuzhou Road suddenly caught fire. Fortunately, it was discovered by the store staff and extinguished with fire extinguishers. Moreover, at around 6 PM the day before yesterday, a similar incident occurred among the debris stored in the corner of the south wall on the second floor. As a result, more than a dozen employees residing in the store and neighbors discussed the matter, saying that it was caused by a fox demon, and they looked at each other in fear. However, according to personnel sent by the police bureau and fire department for investigation, the situation may be similar to the arson case that occurred at the Ye Shude Chinese Medicine Store on Xizang Nanlu last year. Therefore, last night, the police bureau summoned the store manager, Fan Jiangang, for investigation, and will summon all store employees today to clarify the truth.

### British Warship London to Depart; Cossack to Replace It

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the British Information Office, the British cruiser London will leave Shanghai on January 17. In addition, the British destroyer squadron flagship Cossack has requested to sail to Shanghai for a visit. It is reported that the ship will replace the London and will be stationed here until February 3. Because the cost of building houses is expensive, materials are costly, and labor is also high, and it is difficult to collect funds, most of the housing construction projects that are underway have been suspended, so there are very few buyers of vacant land. It is reported that most of the buyers of vacant houses recently are clients from the north. It is also estimated that the transfer fees for general vacant houses have also decreased as real estate prices have fallen. However, since the Council decided to re-establish housing rental standards, transfer fees have slightly increased. The current value is about 70% or 80% of the normal market price before the currency reform.

### Deputy Manager of Qichang Bank Aided in Soliciting Bribes, Sentenced to Probation

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wei Zhonghuai, the deputy manager of the Qichang Bank in the city, colluded with Xia Peide, an inspector of the Shanghai Financial Administration Bureau who is on the run, in a case of soliciting bribes from the impoverished. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wang Yuanhou of the District Court concluded the trial and sentenced Wei Zhonghuai to one year and nine months in prison for assisting in requesting bribes in relation to official duties, with a three-year suspended sentence. In mid-July last year, the Financial Administration Bureau sent inspector Xia Peide to inspect the Qichang Bank's large loans for June and July and the reasons for overdue bill exchanges on July 12. After the inspection, Xia told Wei that there were many irregularities in the bank's accounts, and took the opportunity to request four gold bars as a reward to rewrite the inspection report. Wei negotiated this from the middle, but the bank's board of directors discovered it and reported it to the Financial Administration Bureau, which transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution.

### Unions Meet for Days to Discuss Demanding Improved Index Compilation Methods, Provide Advice to Authorities Several Times

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the price increases began at the end of last year, nearly a month has passed, and prices have risen almost daily during this month. However, the cost of living index for last December was only 18.3 times. Over one million industrial and vocational workers in the city whose salaries and wages are calculated based on the cost of living index have become alarmed. Labor unions have repeatedly requested the General Labor Union to revise the current method of calculating the index and to study remedies for the excessively low index of 18.3 times. Union leaders have met for days to discuss and have visited municipal leaders several times, providing three points of advice for improving index compilation: (1) The rent item in the current index is still based on the survey conducted in July last year. Labor unions have repeatedly requested a survey every three months, and the authorities agreed to a survey every six months. Even if six months is the period, the rent in the January index should be recalculated. (2) The priority rations of industrial and vocational workers, other than rice, such as oil, sugar, and coal briquettes, have long been nominal, and the index should no longer be calculated based on ration prices. The priority rice vouchers for this month have not yet been fully distributed, so all rice in the index should be calculated at market prices. (3) Prices have been rising sharply recently, and conducting price surveys twice a week is too infrequent. The frequency should be increased to three times a week, starting with the upper-period index for this month.

Remarks from Statistical Experts: Analyzing the Reasons for Disconnection

Yesterday, the reporter interviewed several private statistical experts with expertise in the cost of living index and summarized their opinions as follows: (1) The cost of living index salary calculation method itself is not very sound, especially in today's environment of vicious currency inflation and rapid currency depreciation, and it is even more unsuitable. Because the index only represents the comparison of living expenses between one period and another, it can still be used as a salary calculation standard when prices rise slowly and cyclically. However, prices are rising several times a day, and they often increase several times in ten days or half a month. The average number for this half month cannot be equated with prices, and it is difficult to obtain the equivalent value of the base salary when used for salary calculation. If the price increase trend continues, it is necessary to replace the index salary calculation with in-kind salary calculation. (2) The current base salary of workers is calculated by converting the index of 3.63 million times on August 13 last year into gold yuan. This index of 3.63 million times already differed by 25% from the actual prices on that day. Furthermore, the prices in the current index are based on the "August 19" limited price. The average price increase in the six days between August 13 and August 19 was another 60%. Therefore, the salary calculation value of the index after the liberalization of the limited price is different from the index before the currency reform. Under various accumulated factors, the distance between the index and prices will naturally become increasingly different.

### Dispute over Shutdown of Sandaliwan Resolved by Social Affairs Bureau Today

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the dispute over the shutdown of the Sandaliwan Restaurant on Nanjing Road due to the issue of year-end bonuses, the workers reported the situation to reporters yesterday, saying that they are demanding that the Social Affairs Bureau immediately order the employer to resume operations, that the employer bear the workers' losses during the shutdown, and that the year-end bonuses of two months be issued as usual. Yesterday afternoon, employer representative Zhang Zongyi also reported the situation of the dispute to the Social Affairs Bureau, claiming that the workers had implemented a large-scale treat due to the unresolved year-end bonus issue, changing from giving diners two pieces of ribs to six pieces, and from giving two pieces of bread to four pieces, causing the store to suffer losses to the point where it could not resume operations. After receiving the report, Shen Ding, director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, conducted persuasion and scheduled a meeting for the representatives of both labor and management to mediate at 10 AM today.

### Suspicion of Operating Over-the-Counter Securities

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, police officers from the Economic Police Unit were ordered to go to various markets for surveillance. As a result, they discovered a suspect operating over-the-counter securities trading in Room 323 of the Securities Building. The person in charge of the room, Fan Jinkang (resident of No. 1693 Changzhi Road), was arrested on the spot. In addition to confiscating 600,000 shares of Yongshen stock, they also found US$25, one tael of gold, and a bundle of suspicious draft accounts on his person. After being taken to the police station, Fan was detained for interrogation due to the seriousness of the suspicion.

### Grain Prices Will Be Adjusted at Any Time, But Will Not Be Implemented This Month

[Central News Agency] After the announcement of the method of adjusting urban ration grain prices at any time, fluctuations in household rice prices will be inevitable in the future. However, according to reporters from relevant departments, this new method will not be implemented this month due to various technical problems. The people from that department also told reporters that although cost prices will be an important factor in determining ration grain prices in the future, China and the United States will not adopt measures that simply follow market prices. It is inevitable that China and the United States will continue to subsidize losses. Judging from the past situation, the amount of subsidies from China and the United States often reached two-thirds of the selling price. Because the Chinese government is responsible for planning 60% of all rations, the amount of government subsidies is even greater. For example, in October last year, the government lost over 188.8 million gold yuan, while the United States lost 88 million gold yuan. If this continues, it will be difficult to maintain. After the new method is implemented, the losses of both parties can be reduced, and the recovery of grain payments will increase accordingly, ensuring the continued maintenance of the urban ration system.

### Standards for Tuition and Fees at Shanghai University and Soochow University Determined

[Our Newspaper's Report] Apart from St. John's, Datong, Shanghai University, and Soochow University, which started school early, the rest of the private universities and colleges in the city will have to start school in mid-February. The charging standards for St. John's and Datong have been recorded in previous reports. It is now known that the charging issues for Shanghai University and Soochow University have also been decided. Shanghai University started registration for the past two days and will start classes on the 17th. The tuition and fees standard is calculated based on 4.5 dan of rice. According to yesterday's report, the settlement is 1,250 yuan per dan, totaling 5,625 yuan, which is collected in one lump sum. Accommodation fees are charged according to the quality of the rooms, ranging from 6 dou to 1 shi of rice, and are also collected in one lump sum. Meal fees are collected for one month in advance, with each person paying 8 dou and 1 sheng. According to Sun Ruilin, Secretary-General of the university, this standard was determined after considering the burden on parents and the treatment of faculty and staff. The principle is to collect the fees in one lump sum. If parents have many children or civil servants cannot afford it, they can contact the Academic Affairs Office separately for installment payments.

Soochow University will register on the 17th, 18th, and 19th of this month, and classes will start on the 20th. This semester is divided into two terms, each lasting two months. Fee collection, registration procedures, and credit settlement are all handled in two terms. The first term's tuition and fees are based on a base amount of 48 yuan, calculated according to the cost of living index published on the 15th of this month.

### Dispute over Air Transportation of International Refugees; Far Eastern Airlines Concedes

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the dispute between the six major airlines and the International Refugee Organization over the air transportation of international refugees, it was rumored that the International Refugee Organization had expressed its willingness to accept the companies' request to assist in transporting refugees. However, this is not true. The International Refugee Organization only replied to the companies that the lease of Far Eastern Airlines aircraft was decided by the Geneva headquarters and made no other statements. However, the Shanghai representative of Far Eastern Airlines, seeing that the matter had reached a stalemate, which was extremely detrimental to the company, has voluntarily offered to cede some passenger seats to the six major airlines. The two sides are currently negotiating, but have not reached a concrete agreement. On the other hand, the Civil Aviation Administration has approved the takeoff and landing of three aircraft from Far Eastern Airlines, which will carry over a hundred White Russians to the Philippines and Australia. Therefore, it is believed that this dispute can be resolved.

### This Year's Municipal Government Budget Finalized by the Council Committee. Total Revenue Listed at Over 720 Million Yuan.

The draft budget for the 38th year of the city, after being resolved by the eighth general meeting of the Municipal Council and amended and passed according to the review report of the Budget Committee, was finalized by the committee yesterday and will be sent to the Municipal Government for implementation. It is understood that the total revenue in the amended and passed general budget for the 38th year is listed as 727,307,158 gold yuan. This figure is an increase of 131,310,000 gold yuan compared to the original budget compiled by the Municipal Government, including an increase of 30 million gold yuan in land value tax, an increase of 90 million gold yuan in business tax, an increase of 5 million gold yuan in slaughter tax, an increase of 360,000 gold yuan in penalties for violations of police regulations, an increase of 450,000 gold yuan in police administrative fees, and an increase of 5.5 million gold yuan in revenue from cleaning services. It was also decided that the added revenue mentioned above, as well as any increases in tax revenue due to inflation, increases in various remuneration fees, and savings from the Municipal Government's consolidation of overlapping agencies and elimination of redundant personnel, should all be transferred to a reserve fund for adjusting employee salaries and increasing business expenses. Regarding the total expenditure, the review report made three recommendations: (1) The organizational regulations of the Municipal Government should be finalized as soon as possible. Before they are finalized, the Municipal Government should no longer establish new agencies or increase personnel to reduce expenditures. (2) Overlapping agencies should be effectively consolidated and redundant personnel eliminated. (3) In terms of construction, a focus policy should be adopted. Whether it be roads, bridges, houses, vehicles, or office equipment, projects that can be temporarily postponed should be delayed. Projects that must be carried out should be thoroughly constructed to achieve a permanent solution and avoid wasting public funds. In view of the difficult financial situation of the city in the future, the report concluded, "In order to prepare for a rainy day, since we cannot open up new taxes to increase the burden on citizens, we can only save on expenditures to achieve a near balance of revenue and expenditure."

Effectively Consolidate Overlapping Agencies

Regarding the recommendation in the review report to the Municipal Government to effectively consolidate overlapping agencies and eliminate redundant personnel, the report provided detailed opinions on the various bureaus under the Municipal Government as follows: (1) Police administration: It was proposed to abolish the Juvenile Police Team. The "Flying Fortress" (mobile patrol unit) should also be merged with the Motor Vehicle Brigade, and a portion of the personnel should be dismissed. The mobile police stations of the various sub-bureaus should also be abolished, and the name "Economic Police" should be eliminated. The original tasks should be returned to the general administrative police, and all personnel should be reassigned to strengthen the various sub-bureaus and the Security Police Brigade. The Police Education Hall should also be merged under the management of the Police School. (2) Educational administration: The National Education Classes exist in name only. The funds for these classes should be used to add classes to national schools and construct more national school buildings. The Mobile Education Team should be abolished, and its funds should be used to strengthen national education and secondary education. In addition, organizations such as the Pudong Rural Education Zone, the Huxi People's Livelihood Education Zone, the Electrified Education Team, and the People's Literacy Movement Committee should also be abolished. The saved funds should be reallocated for other urgent needs. (3) Public works administration: Several overlapping agencies, such as the Parks Management Office, should be abolished. (4) Public utilities administration: The Vehicle Registration Office should be reformed, and its functions should be merged into the Fourth Division to streamline operations and administration. (5) Health administration: There is no need to separately establish the Venereal Disease Prevention and Treatment Center and the Dental Disease Prevention and Treatment Center. They should be abolished. All municipal hospitals should be converted to public hospitals and establish a board of directors. The Municipal Government should provide free rental of the hospital site and buildings, and each hospital should maintain its original free hospital beds. The funds listed in this year's budget should be converted to subsidies. (6) Social administration: The "Three Public Projects" (San Gong Dian) run by the Social Bureau are underfunded and have little practical effect, so they should also be discontinued. Regarding the elimination of redundant personnel, the report pointed out that the Secretariat of the Municipal Government has 120 technicians. It is recommended to eliminate the weak and retain the strong, and appropriately reduce the number. Due to economic difficulties and a lack of materials, the Public Works Bureau cannot proceed with the planned construction projects, so the road construction personnel should also be reorganized and reduced. After the simplification of business tax collection by the Finance Bureau, the personnel managing business tax in the Business Tax Section and the various collection offices can also be appropriately reduced to save public funds.

The Municipal Council Issues a Statement

Furthermore, a spokesperson for the Municipal Council stated regarding the news published in last night's evening edition of the Shishi Xinbao (The China Times) regarding the council's review of the 38th annual Municipal Government budget, that the council's eighth general meeting reviewed the 38th annual Municipal Government budget and found that the tax revenue estimates listed in the revenue section of the original draft budget were not entirely reasonable. Therefore, after careful review by the Budget Committee, the estimated revenue figures for certain taxes were appropriately increased. The council neither automatically created new taxes nor increased tax rates to increase the burden on the people. The purpose of increasing the revenue budget was to make the budget as close to reality as possible and to urge government tax officials to conscientiously fulfill the mission of executing the budget. This is a task that the council should undertake. The newspaper's headline, "A Strange Case of Budget Review: The Municipal Council Representing the People of Shanghai Actually Passes an Increased Revenue Budget," is confusing.

### British Tramways Experience a Brief Work Stoppage: Workers Refuse to Drive Trams from the Depot Due to Low Wages, Demanding Four Points.

[Our Report] The tramways and trolleybuses of all lines belonging to the British Tramways Company suddenly experienced a work stoppage yesterday morning. All field workers at the Huishan Road and Hede Road depots refused to drive trams from the depot. Upon hearing this news, the executive committee of the company's labor union immediately went to persuade them. The crowd was agitated, saying that they could not make a living with their low wages, and they put forward demands, which totaled four items: (1) In accordance with the current practice of the telephone company, each person should be given an additional meal allowance of 75 cents per day. (2) The annual bonus should be paid out on the 14th of this month, starting with 3,000 yuan per person. If this amount is insufficient based on the cost of living index for this month, the difference will be supplemented after the index is released. (3) The current salary payment schedule of the 10th, 20th, and 30th of each month should be changed to the 5th, 15th, and 25th of each month. (4) Trolleybus drivers should receive an additional license fee of 2 yuan per month as before. The union's executive committee agreed to negotiate with management, and the workers then resumed work. The first tram left the Hede Road depot at 10:20 AM, and the first tram left the Huishan Road depot at 11 AM. By noon, all lines had fully returned to normal.

In the afternoon, the union's executive committee went to the Social Bureau to request mediation but no resolution was reached. They will continue to go there today.

The bonus should be paid out on the 14th of this month, starting with 30 times the base salary, with any adjustments to be made after the index is released.

### Authorities Decide on Methods to Sell Goods and Suppress Price Inflation

The authorities have decided to organize a committee to sell goods and suppress price inflation with all their might. Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, Shan Shuzeng of the Central Bank, Xu Zongwei of the US Aid Agency, and Whitt of the Economic Cooperation Administration held a meeting and drafted the following five measures for selling goods:

(1) A three-person committee organized by the Economic Cooperation Administration's US Aid Joint Operations Association and the Central Bank will be responsible for handling the sale. The representative of the Economic Cooperation Administration will be the chairman.

(2) The funds obtained from the sale, which will be entrusted to the China Textile Construction Corporation (CTCC) to carry out the sale procedures, will be paid directly by the customer into the locked account within the Central Bank and the US Aid Joint Operations Team.

(3) The CTCC will report the market price to the committee every day between 11 AM and 12 PM. The committee will then decide on the number of items to be sold, the quality, and the brands to be sold on the market. The method of selling will be various counts of cotton yarn and unfixed amounts of brands during trading hours. Purchasers will fill out purchase orders and submit them to the collection office. After the purchase orders are collected, the CTCC will open the boxes under the supervision of the committee representative and the market supervisor. If the number of requests does not exceed the quantity available, allocation will be made accordingly. If it is exceeded, the committee will decide on a reduction. The remaining procedures will be handled in accordance with the CTCC's agency regulations.

(4) The target of the sale will be yarn merchants and reproduction industries registered with the CTCC.

(5) These measures should be notified to the Yarn Trade Association immediately, and a representative should be appointed to supervise the opening of the boxes and add a seal to the purchase orders to certify them.

### CTCC Continues Large-Scale Sales, Yarn and Cloth Market Remains Buoyant

The US Aid Yarn and Cloth Joint Operations Office, the Central Bank, and the CTCC listed a large number of cotton yarns for sale yesterday. The US Aid Yarn and Cloth Joint Operations Office entrusted the CTCC to list and sell one type of 42-count Red Blue Phoenix yarn, the Central Bank entrusted the CTCC to list and sell one type of 21-count Golden Double Horse yarn, and the CTCC itself listed and sold thirteen types of cotton yarns, such as 6-count Secondary Sunlight yarn, in large quantities to absorb idle funds.

The cotton yarn market was strong again yesterday. Stimulated by the rise in financial commodities, market sentiment turned positive, and buying interest increased, leading to a firm and rising market price. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose from 84,000 yuan to 90,000 yuan at the close, an increase of 11,500 yuan from the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix yarn reached 90,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon yarn opened at 70,000 yuan, reached a high of 74,000 yuan during the day, and closed at 73,000 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 10,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse spot goods opened at a low of 51,000 yuan, then rose to 60,000 yuan with buyers still entering the market. Before closing, it broke the 60,000 yuan mark, reaching a new high of 60,500 yuan, but finally fell slightly back to 58,500 yuan, an increase of 9,500 yuan. Factory orders for the next day were at 57,500 yuan. 20-count Double Horse yarn rose from 46,000 yuan to 52,000 yuan at the close, an increase of 8,000 yuan from the previous day. 16-count Brightness and Sanming yarns were both traded outside the 40,000 yuan mark. All other yarns also showed a rising trend.

The cloth market rebounded and rose sharply, opening briskly in the morning. After the sharp drop in good-quality products in recent days, many buyers took advantage of the low prices to enter the market. Taiwanese and Guangdong merchants also made scattered purchases. Dyeing factories on this street were actively searching for grey cloth, especially fine cloths such as Leading Brand, Wufu Loudspeaker, and Child Brand, which were in short supply due to depleted stocks. Other grades generally rebounded by about 20%. Leading Brand fine cloth was initially offered at 2,000 yuan outside the market, but rose to 2,200 yuan at noon. Mid-range fine cloths were mainly traded for brands such as Kai B Leading Brand and Qingdao Xihe. Market prices also rose by 300 to 400 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge rose from 1,920 yuan to a high of 1,940 yuan, but fell to a low of 1,840 yuan near noon. At the close, it recovered to 1,830 yuan, an increase of 230 yuan. It was said that there were still inquiries at 1,920 yuan after the close. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong rose by 210 yuan from the previous day, closing at 1,950 yuan. The most significant increase in factory shipments was for printed serge, which rose by 500 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Silk Recovers

Superior-grade raw silk opened at 88,000 yuan. Afterwards, because the market price rose and buying interest increased, the price rose. The afternoon close rose to 92,000 yuan, an increase of 6,700 yuan from yesterday. Zhili Gan silk rose to 70,000 yuan. There were few other inquiries. Because of the foreign exchange discount, the distance between the foreign export trading houses and the market price was too great, so they were all waiting and watching, and the future remained bleak.

Artificial silk Tianqiao opened at 82,000 yuan, then immediately rose to 88,000 yuan for spot goods available immediately. Forward transactions were at 94,000 yuan, an increase of more than 10,000 yuan from yesterday's afternoon close. Intra-industry arbitrage was 90 cents to 1 yuan daily interest. Si Niyasishishi was at 92,000 yuan.

Silk: Huaqiang quilt cover opened at 48,500 yuan, reaching a high of 49,800 yuan, and then falling slightly back to 49,000 yuan at the noon close. Meiya quilt cover rose to 49,500 yuan, an increase of about 7,000 yuan from yesterday's noon close.

### Joint Operations Office Requests Increase in the Proportion of Textile Exports

In order to increase the export of textiles, the Foreign Trade Joint Operations Office decided to request the Executive Yuan to increase the export ratio from 20% to 30% of each factory's production rate.

### Import Licensing Standards Relaxed

Averages 2.5 Million US Dollars per Week

According to the Export Management Committee, since the implementation of the import-export linkage system, the export business has significantly improved because the foreign exchange settlement prices are adjusted according to the facts at any time. In order to thoroughly promote the import-export linkage system, the Export Management Committee has recently relaxed the review standards for import licensing again. Currently, the import licenses issued daily are approximately between 200,000 and 400,000 US dollars, averaging about 2.5 million US dollars per week. Most of these issued licenses belong to the quota part which was issued earlier, but the number belonging to the non-quota part is also substantial. If the export situation can continue to improve, the relaxation of the quotas for the second quarter of the 90th year is expected to be approved by the authorities.

### Changes in Interest Rate Quotes of National Banks

Yesterday, the interest rate quotes of national banks were changed. The rediscount and daily discount were changed to 23 yuan and 30 cents, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 70 cents.

Regarding the issuance technology, efforts will be made to simplify it. The China Trust Bureau and the Central Bank are actively preparing. The China Trust Bureau is rushing to issue notifications to the Central Bank, and the Central Bank will immediately produce and print foreign currency certificates. The portion of foreign exchange to be offset is expected to be issued next week.

### Money Market Slightly Loosens, Rice, Flour, and Edible Oil Prices Rebound

Yesterday, the rice market rebounded again, because the money market was slightly looser, off-site prices rebounded, and market sentiment also turned positive. In addition, the arrival of goods decreased, and opening bids rose by about 200 yuan. However, because the shadow interest rate was still high, the appetite of the grain merchants was not strong, so although the price rose, sales were not active, and the price fell back by 50 yuan. The South City market price for white japonica rice was 1,445 yuan, the price for thin japonica rice was initially 1,500 yuan, closing at 1,450 yuan, and the price for early rice was 1,400 yuan, each rising by about 150 yuan compared to the previous day. White yuan rice rose by 150 yuan, and Yin yuan rice rose by 200 yuan. In the North City market, early thin japonica rice and white japonica rice each rose by 150 to 160 yuan. The total arrival of goods in the two markets was 6,143 shi.

Flour

Turned up, Lao Che and Bingchuan flour were offered outside the 500-yuan mark again. Due to the rise in rice prices and off-site prices, and the slightly loosened money market, the market turned firm. Lao Che flour opened immediately at 500 yuan, reaching 505 yuan, and later rose further to 515 yuan at the close, an increase of 62 yuan. Bingchuan flour closed at 504 yuan, an increase of 66 yuan. Red Bee and Jiancheng flour each rose by 65 yuan, and miscellaneous brand flour rose by 60 to 70 yuan. Large bags of bran rose sharply by 58 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

Xiangrong and soybeans rose by 100 yuan. Hankou Zhazou beans have not opened for many days, and opened at 900 yuan yesterday. Jianqing rose by 150 yuan, but returned to fatigue at the close. Corn fell uniquely, because the Qingdao price was fatigued and the out-of-town merchants did not accept it. The closing price fell by 50 yuan. Red sorghum still had good sales in the interior, rising by 50 yuan. Green bean flour factories reduced sales, rising by 100 yuan. Yuan wheat rose by 70 to 80 yuan, and sesame rose by 200 to 250 yuan. Raw peanut owners also raised the price by 200 to 300 yuan.

Edible Oil

Rose. Due to the rise in black market gold prices and the slightly loosened money market, the owners raised the price. Soybean oil initially opened at 4,600 yuan, reached a high of 4,900 yuan, and closed at 4,800 yuan, an increase of 600 yuan from the previous day. Rapeseed oil rose from 4,400 yuan to 4,600 yuan, closing at 4,600 yuan, an increase of 550 yuan. Jibao rapeseed oil crossed the 5,000 yuan mark, reaching 5,300 yuan, an increase of 500 yuan. Small-scale sesame oil had the lowest price, closing at only 3,900 yuan, an increase of 400 yuan. Soybean cake sales were sluggish, mostly transactions by retail investors, and the price rose by 30 to 40 yuan. Changzi cake closed at 360 yuan.

### Tea Market's Rising Trend Difficult to Curb

Since the tea market has been rising steadily for days, yesterday it was still brisk and not discouraged. Although the market's position was not relaxed, the minds of the same industry were still nurtured by the surge in prices outside the circle. In addition, tea stocks were depleted and the cost of reproduction was still difficult to suppress, so sales intentions were still firm, and quotations soared again. As a result, the trend was reported to be repeatedly increased. Judging from this situation, the rising trend of selling prices may be difficult to reverse temporarily. As for checking transactions, because the entry was quite difficult to achieve, the business was still narrow.

[Our Report] The French ship Mandu left Shanghai yesterday morning to return to France, with a large batch of tea transported, totaling more than 14,500 boxes, equivalent to 2,400 tons, transported to Casablanca, North Africa. There were also 24 packages of silk waste transported to Marseille.

### Tung Oil Trend Brisk

Yesterday's Tung Oil Market: After opening, it turned brisk and extraordinary due to the relaxation of the money market, the reported rise in various items, and the induced entry of people's minds into the rising trend. After that, the position was tight again, and the same industry was greatly threatened. The process gradually returned to flat, and the closing result was mostly similar to the next day, but the base was more solid than before.

Hong Kong delayed their response for a long time, until yesterday, when their reply finally arrived, requesting a postponement until April. The Football Committee held a special meeting yesterday afternoon, passing the Hong Kong side's request to extend the match to April and temporarily halting all preparatory work. The trials scheduled for this weekend have also been cancelled. Regarding Hannibal's application for reinstatement, expressing remorse for his actions, the Football Committee decided yesterday not to immediately approve it, only agreeing to restore his eligibility to play after August 31st. This is undoubtedly a considerable disappointment for the Tung Wah Football Club.

Mayor's Cup Registration Begins

The Football Committee held a meeting at noon yesterday, resolving various matters and announcing them as follows:

(1) Approved the Hong Kong Football Club's letter stating that due to the current situation, the interport match originally scheduled to be held in Shanghai during the Lunar New Year has been postponed to April. All preparatory work in this city is temporarily suspended, and the selection trials this weekend are cancelled.

(2) Tung Wah team member Hannibal submitted a written application, expressing remorse for his rude behavior during last year's Mayor's Cup final and requesting reinstatement of his eligibility to participate in matches. Resolved, that Hannibal has generally demonstrated good sportsmanship in the past, and since he acknowledges his error and should be given an opportunity to reform. However, the offense of assaulting a referee is serious. The permanent suspension is reduced to a ban from playing until August 31st, 1950.

(3) The second round of the Group A matches will begin on January 22nd. Teams may apply to schedule friendly matches this weekend.

(4) Decided that the association will hold a charity match during this season, with the proceeds donated to the Sports Association's Board of Directors to subsidize various charitable organizations.

(5) Registration for this year's Mayor's Cup and Junior Cup will be open from January 15th to January 22nd. The registration fee is 300 yuan per team, and the competition will begin in mid-February.

### New Basketball Rules for This Year; Basketball Committee Announces Key Points

The Municipal Sports Association Basketball Committee, in order to meet the needs, has requested the latest basketball rules for 1948-49 from the American Basketball Association. These new rules arrived by airmail a few days ago. Since this year's league is about to begin, the Municipal Basketball Committee will translate and publish the new rules. The key points of the new rules for this year (1948-49) that differ from the old rules are announced below for your attention.

(1) A player who commits a personal foul should raise their hand above their head when the referee announces the foul to help the scorer record the personal foul correctly. However, this is a suggestion and there is no penalty for not doing so.

(Old rules: No need to raise hand)

(2) A substitute player reports to the scorer and waits for the whistle. After the referee or inspector indicates with a hand signal, the substitute can directly enter the court without reporting to the referee or inspector.

(Old rules: Failure to report to the referee or inspector is a technical foul)

(3) In a 40-minute game, the clock should be stopped for every dead ball after 18 minutes in the second half (the last two minutes) and in the last two minutes of each overtime period.

(Old rules: Last three minutes)

(4) All jump balls must be held in the nearest restricted circle (i.e., the center circle with a radius of six and a half feet and the two large circles in the free-throw areas).

(Old rules: If players touching the restricted circle during a jump ball, the jump ball is held in the restricted circle. If a jump ball is near the sideline, it is held six feet away from the sideline. Jump balls in other locations are held nearby)

(5) After a jump ball is tapped, any one of the ten players can touch the ball first and pass it back to the backcourt.

(Old rules: Only the eight players other than the jumpers have this right)

(6) When the ball goes out of bounds, if it is simultaneously touched last by players from both teams or the officials have conflicting opinions, a jump ball should be held between the two relevant opponents in the nearest restricted circle.

(Old rules: Jump ball is held six feet from the sideline)

(7) If a designated free-throw shooter leaves the court due to injury or disqualifying foul, the free throw should be taken by their substitute. If the team has no substitute players, it can be taken by any of the remaining teammates on the court.

(Old rules: Did not specify that a teammate on the court could take the free throw)

(8) If a player is substituted out of the game during a dead ball, and the game has not yet restarted during the same dead ball time, the player can immediately be substituted back in without it being considered a technical foul.

(Old rules: This is a technical foul)

(9) Players may talk or discuss with the coach during a timeout.

(Old rules: This is considered coaching from outside the court and is a technical foul)

(10) When throwing the ball inbounds, if teammates on the court are standing close to the sideline in a row, the opposing team can request that the players of the two teams stand apart.

(Old rules: No such provision)

### Appealing Before Justice: A Distressed Woman Pleads for Assistance from Kind-Hearted Individuals; Willing to Do Any Work; Financial Assistance More Than Welcome

Dear Editor: The cruelty and ruthlessness of the times have transformed my personality, which for over twenty years had never shed a tear or lowered its head easily, into a helpless and powerless weak woman. I remember when I was in school, listening to history stories, I was deeply impressed by the extraordinary deeds of so-called Hua Mulan, Qin Liangyu, Shen Yunying, and other remarkable women. A vivid and dazzling dream often lingered in my mind, waiting for the arrival of a great opportunity. Coincidentally, when I was fifteen years old, the sacred national war of resistance broke out, and my beautiful dream came true. I took off my skirt, disguised myself as a man, and on the eve of the great storm about to descend on my hometown of Zhengzhou, I abandoned my warm family, my kind parents, and set out on a journey with a group of young companions. I participated in almost every battle, including the Battle of He'erzhuang, the Battle of Xuzhou, and the Great Fire of Changsha, braving the dangers of the battlefield. I regret not being able to personally kill the enemy invaders, but I did my part as a Chinese daughter. My footsteps traversed Lu, Yu, Xiang, E, Gan, Gui, and Sichuan, and I ended up in the Great Northwest, still engaged in supporting the war of resistance, for as long as four years. Eating in the wind and sleeping in the dew, riding horses and shooting guns, all enriched my small life. At this time, my life underwent another major transformation, which was that I pursued another life, and married, and had children. In my seven years of kitchen life, there was my happiness, and there were also many of my troubles, but I believed that I could also fulfill my so-called "domestic help" responsibilities. However, because our burden was extremely heavy, for seven or eight years we have been struggling below the level of barely making ends meet. Unfortunately, the bitter years are endless, and the tragic wheel of fate is pursuing the country, and also pursuing us. This summer, my hometown was occupied, and dragging my children with me, I fled to the south of the Yangtze River, with no one to turn to, and because I had no savings, I began to suffer the hardships of the world. In those three months of unemployment, there were times when we ate only one meal a day, and there were times when we could not light a fire for three days. The sound of my children crying from hunger shattered my heart. At this time, I, a woman who rarely shed tears, often washed my face with tears in the quiet of the night, unable to control myself. Fortunately, heaven never cuts off all hope, and we finally found a glimmer of life in this vast sea, which allowed us to stabilize our refugee life for a few months. Who would have thought that after the battle in Huaihai, and the capital being shaken, our only rice bowl was blown away by the ruthless storm! (To be continued)

### Changzhou County Government Stalled, New County Chief Has Not Assumed Office

[Report from Wujin, this newspaper, 11th] Since the former county chief of this county, Luo Dongfan, resigned to go to Beijing to serve as the Director of the Municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs, the new county chief, Wu Zhilin, has been approved and announced by the provincial government meeting for more than ten days. The county government has not received any news about when Wu will arrive. The former section secretary of the county government returned to await handover and repeatedly telegraphed the provincial government to urge him to come, but there was no response. According to news from the provincial capital: the Department of Civil Affairs has not seen the new county chief report to the personnel office, and does not know his contact address. A special dispatch order was sent to Chairman Ding's official residence for transfer, but it was returned. The Personnel Office of the Department of Civil Affairs and the Provincial Adjutant's Office are sending personnel to search everywhere. Currently, the heads of the Land Administration Bureau and the Land Tax Office of the county government have resigned with permission, and all departments are waiting to be handed over, resulting in the stagnation of county administration.

The Congested Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway 本報記者 Jiang Feng [Report from Jinhua, this newspaper, 8th] The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which runs through the three provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan, was finally completed before the start of the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign with the repair of the Gan River pontoon bridge, and the entire line was opened. This lifeline of the southeast is once again shouldering the dual responsibility of military affairs and transportation.

In the past month or so, the traffic density on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line has suddenly increased several times. Under the condition of congenital deficiency, it appears to be somewhat congested. Initially, thousands upon thousands of refugee students poured from all corners of the Central Plains to the Shanghai-Nanjing area, and then followed the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line to be sent to Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces to establish schools and settle down. For a period of time, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was used to transport refugees from the four provinces of Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui. Passenger and freight trains Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 41, and 42 were suspended, and all rolling stock was allocated to transport refugee students. Sometimes, even express trains Nos. 1 and 2 were attached with special trains to evacuate students. It took a full month to bring the evacuation of more than 20,000 refugee students to an end.

Following this, the Xuzhou-Bengbu war became urgent, and large and small agencies in Nanjing were busy evacuating their families. In addition to some who went south via the sea and air routes, most of the families and luggage poured into the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line. They transferred to Zhuzhou, and then transferred to Hengyang, Guilin, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong. Every day, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line was full of special evacuation trains heading southwest, and ordinary passenger and freight trains almost disappeared.

At the same time, the four railway lines of Longhai, Jinpu, Huainan, and Jiangnan were also affected by the war and were busy evacuating employees, families, materials, and files to the southwest. As a result, the evacuation special trains of each railway also passed through the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway one after another, turning to various places in the southwest.

The Zhejiang-Jiangxi line was repaired not long ago, and its own rolling stock was extremely lacking. Most of the carriages were allocated to evacuate government officials, families, refugee students, and military transport. Therefore, the passenger and freight transport of this line was almost paralyzed. The original daily passenger and freight transport was crowded on the few passenger and freight trains that were available and occasionally operated. Often, they would have to wait for three or four days at the starting station without being able to get on the train.

Because the train service was in a state of semi-paralysis, the prices of goods in the cities along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line became unbalanced, creating opportunities for individual peddlers to become active. All trains were crowded with "individual peddlers." From western-style and Guangzhou general merchandise such as cigarettes, cloth, matches, soap, and cotton fabrics heading west, to local products such as chicken, duck, pork, winter bamboo shoots, and oranges heading north, a wide variety of items were scattered on the backs, roofs, or crowded in the carriages. This further increased the congestion and chaos of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line.

In this way, the recently restored Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway suddenly increased in traffic density due to the impact of the war. However, all facilities are still extremely simple. For example, some small stations have insufficient tracks. If a train breaks down due to some special situation, the trains going up and down the line cannot pass. Another example is Jinhua Station, which has seven tracks, which is usually sufficient for the traffic density of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway itself. However, because the evacuation trains passing through the station are often parked and fill every track, the trains going up and down the line are detained at the front stations at both ends for several hours, waiting for the tracks to be cleared before they can enter the station.

Another reason that deepens the congestion of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line is that the driving force of the entire line relies entirely on Pingxiang coal in the far west to supply the trains in the east, which has to be driven by Pingxiang coal more than a thousand kilometers away. Therefore, it is often too slow to meet the urgent need. For example, at Jinhua Station, there were five westbound trains parked at the station at the same time one day, waiting for the coal from the east to arrive. According to the person in charge of train operations on the line, the reporter was told that the coal transport trains of the line are sometimes intercepted and detained by soldiers who do not understand the situation, forcing them to carry other items or military transport. Therefore, the coal supply at each coal loading station on the entire line has been seriously affected, which has deepened the paralysis of the entire line.

The reporter recently made a round trip on the eastern section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, and saw that the congestion in the carriages and the chaos in the order were really like the scene of fleeing from disaster in 1937. Day and night, tens of thousands of passengers and mountains of luggage are waiting for trains. As long as there is a train, they will squeeze onto it. The young and strong, or those who hold guns, take advantage. In addition to being crowded with people, the carriages are also full of boxes, luggage, stoves, cooking utensils, tables, chairs, sofas, and even cradles and toilets... All kinds of things are messy and crowded. The carriage doors and aisles are completely blocked. If you can get on the train, you may not be able to get off the train. The windows are broken repeatedly, almost forming a convenient door for those getting on and off the train.

It is said that the authorities of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway have exhausted their efforts to think of ways to improve the situation and restore normal train operation. It is hoped that this chaotic and congested situation can be completely eliminated in the short term.

### Battle at Tsinghua Garden Lasted a Day and Night; Fortunate That Shells Landed in the School

[Tianjin, 10th, airmail] During the recent battle, fighting occurred near the campus for a day and night. However, no shells landed in the school, and it was not subjected to looting due to strict defense. It is now a demilitarized zone. On the 20th of last month, a plane once flew over to drop a total of nine bombs. One landed next to a small bridge in front of the 工字 Hall, one landed on the northern road of the West Courtyard, and the remaining seven landed in open spaces. Fortunately, no one was injured, and no school buildings were hit. All employees and students in the school are safe, and there have been no more planes bombing since then. Winter vacation started on the 9th. The stored grain is enough for three months, and there is no problem with living. Postal and telecommunications between the city and the countryside have been interrupted for a long time, and remittances are also impossible. There are also a large number of people isolated in the city, including more than 100 families of teachers and staff, and more than 200 students. The Teachers and Staff Liaison Committee is responsible for solving various problems.

### Passenger Car on Jia-Tong Road Overturned in the Calamity of War: Two Dead, Twenty-Four Injured

[Report from Jiaxing, this newspaper, 11th] A car on the Jiaxing-Tongxiang Road overturned in the middle of the road on the afternoon of the 10th. Two passengers died on the spot, twenty-four were injured, and six escaped unharmed. It is learned that the overturned passenger car was No. 1300, originally driven by driver Li Youhai. Due to a temporary illness, it was driven by driver Li Sibao. When the car was driving to Yangqiao No. 7 (about seven kilometers away from Hecheng), the bridge was completely filled with mud. The mud surface was loose due to sunlight during the cold weather in the past few days. When the car reached the bridge surface, the front wheels fell in, and the car body tilted. For a while, the driver could not control it, causing the car body to overturn into a paddy field eight feet high from the bridge surface, causing this tragedy.

### The Bubble of Hong Kong

— Xie Mingxin

[Hong Kong, 11th, airmail] A cold wave has struck, and the weather in Shanghai has dropped below zero degrees Celsius. Hong Kong is still around 40 to 50 degrees Celsius, but people living in Hong Kong have already felt surprisingly cold.

In the past, Hong Kong was still a political center. Shen Junru, Cai Tingkai, Zhang Bojun and other "democratic figures" went north earlier. Recently, Li Jishen, Mao Dun, Shi Fuliang and others left Hong Kong around Christmas last year. The only people left are Long Yun, who is on "leave," and some second- and third-rate figures from the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, today's Hong Kong is no longer a Chinese political center on the periphery.

Due to the shift of the political center, Hong Kong residents unanimously took a dim view of the possibility of "peace talks" without expecting to. There are also one or two small parties (such as the Chinese Independent Democratic Party, etc.) composed of some idle political swindlers in Hong Kong, who are flaunting themselves everywhere, issuing declarations, printing pamphlets, and receiving reporters, preparing to make a futile investment in the "New Political Consultative Conference." Now this kind of speculative business has obviously failed. This is a small bubble in the political tide.

Taiwan Province has changed hands. Ms. Zheng Yuxiu, wife of the former governor of the province, Wei Daoming, arrived in Hong Kong on the 9th on the Shengjing, carrying more than a hundred pieces of luggage.

Although more and more people are coming to Hong Kong from the mainland every day, the phenomenon of business depression is spreading throughout the island. Although the streets are crowded with people, the business of the shops is unusually bleak. Merchants engaged in import and export are always sighing bitterly. Prices are depreciating day by day, and it is not uncommon for the selling price to be insufficient to cover the cost of ordering. The reason is that the war in the mainland is endless, and the market is becoming increasingly narrow. There are many orders and slow sales. Everyone is afraid of the approaching Lunar New Year.

### Feicheng Past and Present

— Special correspondent of Sanbao News 費超然 Fei Chaoran

[Report from Hefei, this newspaper, 7th] After the victory, the provincial government came here gracefully. Hefei was like a dead tree in spring, with a hundred flowers blooming. The ancient city, which had been broken after the robbery, leapt to become the central metropolis of Anhui Province's politics and military affairs, and the population suddenly increased dramatically. In the past three years, the market has become increasingly prosperous and all industries have become increasingly developed. However, all prices have continued to rise due to excessive consumption. The luckiest merchants all smiled and made a fortune year after year. Teahouses, restaurants, hotels, and bathhouses were full every day. The housing shortage also became increasingly serious every day. Every landlord regarded their house as a scarce commodity. Every morning, the area west of Shizi Street, the Fuxue, and the two vegetable markets were crowded with elegantly dressed, imposing modern ladies who were purchasing rice, grass, oil, salt, fish, meat, vegetables, and household items. They pretended to be rich and did not care about the high prices. In the spring of 1948, the construction of the new Hefei began again, and most of it has now been completed, which is enough for the conditions of a small city. In the midst of this heated activity, unexpectedly, the provincial government and various departments suddenly moved back to Anqing on December 20, 1948, amidst the sound of "talent going to the countryside." Government officials and their families, who were dispersed to the corners of 64 counties and cities, flowed out in various ways like a tide. The Hefei market suddenly felt the desolation of few visitors. The reporter specifically reports on the current situation as follows:

After the Provincial Government Moved, All Industries Declined

According to a detailed investigation of the Hefei market: there are only a dozen or so sole proprietorships, and the rest are shareholders' businesses that pool together small amounts of money. There are fewer wholesale businesses and more retail businesses. The only main customers are government employees and their families who are consumers. As a result, government employees became thinner day by day, while business and industrial elements became fatter day by day. Since the end of last year, the general clientele has left, and the retail business has plummeted. In addition, every family has renovated their facades, cutting flesh to cure carbuncles, spending huge construction costs. The turbulent situation has also affected the flourishing business of the "golden September and silver October." At the same time, Hefei's banks and money houses have also been evacuated and closed, making it impossible to turn around. Large-scale transportation and sales have high expenditures and limited income. Therefore, until now, except for a few merchants with strong capital, who have a slight surplus, all the others are at risk of losing money after calculating the accounts. It is feared that many of the businesses selling imported goods will close down next spring. Recently, dozens of military uniform stores, photo studios, printing shops, and barber shops have closed down and moved away. The market has found a bleak scene, which makes people feel the sense of the past and present. Even the foreign modern ladies who frequented the area west of Shizi Street, the Fuxue, and the two vegetable markets have disappeared without a trace. The prices of rice, grass, oil, salt, fish, meat, vegetables, and daily necessities cannot rise crazily, turning into a blessing for ordinary people.

A Half-Finished Beauty of New Architecture

The old and broken Feicheng after the robbery was transformed into a new city in the spring of 1948, thanks to the resolute decision of the former Director of Construction, Zhang Zongliang, who ordered the Municipal Engineering Bureau to divide the entire city into four phases and start construction in sections. The first phase was the section of Zhongzheng East Road (from Dongdajie to Shizijiekou), about three miles of business houses, each retreated one room to the north and south, and repaired into cement pedestrian streets. The facade was rebuilt in western style, and the original red foundation stone road in the street was rebuilt into a flat and wide road. After several months of construction, the project was completed after the Mid-Autumn Festival. The second phase was the section of Zhongzheng Middle Road (from Guloudajie to Fuxuejie) and Yingdian Middle Road (from Shizijie to Sipailou North Street). After the Mid-Autumn Festival, about four miles of intensive reconstruction projects were carried out as described above. About nine-tenths of the project has now been completed, and the road is still being paved. It is expected that it will be fully completed outside the Lunar New Year. At present, the city appearance of the east and middle sections of Hefei has been completely renewed, with the atmosphere of a small city. However, the third phase of the project, Zhongshan East, Middle, and West Roads (from Xiaodongmen to Dazhimen), and the fourth phase of Yingdian North Road (from Shizijie North to Beimenkou) are likely to be slowed down or stopped after the provincial capital moved, due to the large scale of the project and the difficulty in construction costs. Feicheng will become a city with a combination of new and old, as if it is a half-finished beauty.

People Gone, Buildings Empty; Arrogant Before, Respectful After

Landlords who regarded their houses as scarce commodities used to increase rents every one or two months, even abandoning the use of legal tender and gold yuan coupons, and changing the rent to three to five dou of rice per room. They even demanded prepayment of three months, five months, one year, or half a year. The conditions were harsh, forcing the government employees who were tenants to have no way to go, so they had to endure, borrow and pawn to pay the rent rice, so as not to be homeless. They formed a tenants' union several times to negotiate together, but it was ineffective. Now that people are gone, houses are empty everywhere, and the situation is very different. The landlords are particularly polite, changing their former hideous faces. In order to avoid stationing troops, they are asking people everywhere to introduce tenants, welcoming them to move in immediately. The rent is also generous, automatically reducing it by half, or not caring about it; some even do not want rent, and allow people to live for free, just so that others do not occupy it. The arrogance before and the respect after is to this extent!

(2) In areas where the boundary line is unclear, before the demarcation is determined, the relevant county governments shall jointly be responsible for the suppression of opium, and shall handle it together at any time. If it is necessary to handle it urgently, they may conduct a separate search or arrest first, and report it to the neighboring province for review afterward. They shall not shirk responsibility or dispute with each other. (3) In areas where two or more provinces are adjacent and where the habit of stealing and planting opium seedlings has been formed, the county governments adjacent to the area shall jointly prevent and investigate and eradicate it, and any one county may automatically convene a meeting to discuss the handling. (4) If the opium control agencies in Province A discover that opium is being smuggled to a certain place in Province B, they shall immediately notify the opium control agency in that place in Province B by the fastest communication method to arrest it. If the time is tight and there is no time to notify, they may freely follow and pursue the opium and criminals. The opium and criminals shall be sent by the capturer to the county government under its jurisdiction for verification. (5) If Province A discovers that an opium criminal has fled to Province B, they shall immediately follow and pursue him regardless of the boundary, and notify the local government of the location to assist in the arrest.

The opium criminal shall be escorted to the county government under the jurisdiction of Province A for handling in accordance with the law. (6) If an opium criminal is hidden in a border area, and one party discovers it but the other party does not assist in the arrest, or if one party pursues an opium fugitive and the other party knows and assists in it, it shall be reported to the provincial government for punishment. (7) If opium criminals are hidden in a border area of two or more provinces, and they are not arrested and brought to justice but are discovered by others, the local officials in the border area shall be punished for ineffective suppression.

(10) The county governments in the border areas of the seven provinces may, depending on the needs, negotiate with the relevant county governments under the jurisdiction of the neighboring provinces and report the detailed rules for cooperation based on these measures, and report them to the respective provincial governments for filing.
