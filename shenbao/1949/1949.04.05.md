### Peace Talks Officially Begin Today: Discussing Eight Guiding Principles; Communists Agree to Issue Ceasefire Order

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Confirmed information: The official negotiations between the government and the Communist peace delegations are scheduled to commence on the 5th in Peiping. Furthermore, the Communists have agreed to halt military offensives during the peace talks. This order will be issued by the Communist military authorities, notifying frontline troops. These two points were brought back by Acting President Li’s personal envoy, Huang Chi-han, who returned to Nanjing from Peiping on the 3rd aboard a special China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane. It is understood that after arriving in Peiping, the government peace delegation immediately engaged in informal contact with the Communist representatives to discuss the technical aspects of the peace negotiation process. This work has now been completed, and thus it has been decided to begin formal talks on the 5th to discuss the eight conditions proposed by Mao Tse-tung. The Communist Party's attitude towards the eight conditions remains unchanged in principle, but the scope has been considered for relaxation. The extent of this relaxation will be discussed and decided during the formal meetings. This is the most important development before the start of these peace talks, and it can also be seen as the key to the success or failure of future negotiations. Regarding the Communist Party's agreement to cease military offensives, due to the numerous technical and detailed aspects of a comprehensive ceasefire that require further study, a decision cannot be reached in the short term. Therefore, this matter must be reserved for discussion in the formal meetings. However, military offensives will obviously have an impact during the peace talks, so the government specifically requested this from the Communist Party to allow the peace talks to proceed in a harmonious atmosphere. Therefore, after three days of contact and informal meetings between the government representatives and the Communist side, the Communist Party has agreed. This cessation of military offensives marks the beginning of a de facto ceasefire, and the hope for comprehensive peace seems to have taken another step forward. Judging from the above news, the government peace delegation has already achieved significant success. During this period, in addition to close contact with the Communist peace representatives, they also met with Mao Tse-tung and other Communist leaders, and the situation was positive. After returning to Nanjing on the 3rd, Huang Chi-han immediately went to Acting President Li's official residence in Chuanhougang that evening to report. Huang also brought back many letters, with letters from government representatives and advisors addressed to their respective relevant individuals.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The procedures for the peace talks are roughly divided into three stages: (1) Preliminary exchange of opinions, (2) Formal talks, and (3) Political Consultative Conference. The preliminary exchange of opinions stage has now concluded, and the formal talks will begin on the 5th. This stage will discuss the principles of the eight conditions. If progress is smooth and a conclusion is reached, then the second stage can be declared complete, and the reorganization of a coalition government, etc., may be launched immediately. A new Political Consultative Conference can also be expected to be prepared and convened to resolve the technical issues related to the eight conditions, such as the abolition of the constitution and the reorganization of the military. Observers believe that the achievements that can be obtained in the first stage will be seen in the Communist Party's cessation of offensives, with a de facto ceasefire seemingly a smooth beginning. However, the second stage may immediately encounter difficulties, so the convening of a new Political Consultative Conference is likely to be very distant.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The government peace delegation has been in Peiping for four days. All contacts in the past three days have been general visits and informal exchanges of opinions. However, the Communist authorities attach great importance to the delegation. The Communist figures contacted by the delegation, in addition to the five peace representatives, Zhou Enlai, and other democratic figures, also included Mao Tse-tung, who has already met with them. It is reported that the government delegation has been listening to Communist broadcasts for several days, and the criticism of the government is still extremely sharp and insulting. They inquired about this with the Communist Party, and the response was that this was done by political workers and not an instruction from the authorities, indicating that the Communist Party is sincere in seeking peace and that this is unrelated.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] On the eve of the official start of the peace talks, Acting President Li, after listening to Huang Chi-han's report on Peiping, specifically invited key figures in Nanjing to gather at the official residence on the 4th to discuss relevant countermeasures. He also spoke with Zhang Zhizhong in Peiping twice by long-distance telephone to exchange opinions and instruct on the attitude to be taken. Those present at the meeting included He Yingqin, Wu Zhongxin, Weng Wenhao, Huang Chi-han, and Qiu Changwei.

### Lei Chen Expresses Thoughts on Peace Talks: Urges National Vigilance; The Issue of the So-Called Coalition Government Cannot Be Ignored

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 4th] Lei Chen, former Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, made a statement before leaving Taiwan on the 3rd, saying: "Peace is what the people of the whole country are seeking, and we naturally hope that a reasonable and true peace will be realized. However, we must not ignore the issue of the so-called coalition government, but should be especially vigilant, because if the result of the peace talks is the realization of the so-called coalition government manipulated by the Chinese Communists, then the future of China will be unthinkable. This can be explained from two aspects: First, in terms of internal affairs, it will inevitably lead to an anti-freedom, anti-democracy, and anti-humanity future, achieving a situation of Communist violent dictatorship. Second, in terms of diplomacy, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet government is morally obliged to provide assistance to the National Government. In the future, if a coalition government is produced to inherit the legitimacy of the National Government, and the so-called coalition government is essentially controlled by the Chinese Communists, then the Soviet government can legitimately, under the guise of assistance, pull China into the Communist International Iron Curtain. The example of Czechoslovakia can serve as a warning. This is what we should pay special attention to regarding the future of the peace talks. If the result is like this, we must firmly oppose it." Lei continued to express his thoughts on the current peace talks, saying: "During the preparation process for these peace talks, the Chinese Communists' style is very different from the democratic spirit of the government during the Political Consultative Conference in 1946. First, at that time, the government side was not only very polite in receiving and negotiating with the Chinese Communist representatives, but also maintained a tolerant attitude in the conference hall despite the Chinese Communist representatives' unbridled insults, and even humiliations. Moreover, the newspapers in the government area also accepted the government's guidance to avoid publishing provocative texts. But this time, the Chinese Communist broadcasts are in the tone of the surrendered, referring to the government representatives as representatives of the reactionary government. Second, before the opening of the Political Consultative Conference at that time, the Chinese Communist representative Zhou Enlai insisted on not participating in the meeting without a ceasefire, and the government finally ordered a ceasefire at 8:00 a.m. on the day of the opening of the meeting (January 10), and the meeting began at 10:00 a.m. Now, the Chinese Communist troops are still actively attacking Anqing and other outposts north of the Yangtze River, as well as the situation around Xiangfan and Zhengyi, which are obvious examples. Third, when the Political Consultative Conference was held at that time, news was not blocked, reporters could participate in the audience, and report freely. Now, the peace talks in Peiping do not allow reporters to attend, and what is the essence of the "democracy" that the Chinese Communists have been promoting in recent years? We can also roughly get a powerful counter-evidence from this."

### North-South Air Traffic: Rumor Has It That the Communists Agreed to Discuss Resumption

[Reuters, Nanjing, 4th] According to reports here: The Communist side has agreed to discuss the issue of resuming North-South air traffic, in order to allow the Central Airlines to establish a radio station in Peiping to maintain contact with the Beijing-Shanghai head office, and to allow the company's aircraft to carry mail and cargo, and land in Peiping and Tianjin.

### Chinese and Foreign Reporters: Postponing Trip to Peiping; Zhang Zhizhong's Reply Telegraphed to Nanjing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Regarding the request from Chinese and foreign journalists to be allowed to go to Peiping to cover the news of the peace talks, Zhang Zhizhong, chief representative of the government peace delegation, has given a reply. He telegraphed the Capital Journalists' Association from Peiping, stating briefly: After the delegation arrived in Peiping, it resolutely exchanged opinions with the Communist representatives, and all agreed that it is advisable for Chinese and foreign journalists to postpone their trip to Peiping for the time being, as the peace talks have just begun. Please inform all newspapers to understand.

### Acting President Li Hosts Banquet: Receives National Representatives Staying in Nanjing; Explains That Seeking Peace Can Achieve Something

### Yan Xishan Postpones Return to Taiyuan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Yan Xishan will stay in Nanjing for another three to several days before returning to Taiyuan due to Acting President Li's retention. Yan told reporters on the 4th that if the peace talks are successful, he will abide by the government's orders. If the peace talks are not successful, he is determined to resist to the death to defend Taiyuan. Regarding the reported statement by Fu Zuoyi, Yan judged, based on his understanding of Fu's character, that this move may be the result of the Chinese Communist Party's planned persuasion of Fu. Although he has no facts to prove it, he does not believe that the statement was written by the Chinese Communist Party and forced Fu to sign it. He believes that the statement may have come from Fu's secretary's pen. Yan believes that the Chinese Communist Party's approach is a propaganda offensive against the government to win more individual surrenders.

### Chairmen of Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia Provinces Summoned to Fly to Nanjing Together Today

They will fly to Nanjing together with Guo Jiqiao, chairman of Gansu Province, on the 5th. It is reported that the three men were summoned by Acting President Li.

[Our Newspaper News] American reporter Lademan recently traveled to Chongqing, Chengdu, Lanzhou, Xining and other places, and visited Ma Bufang, chairman of Qinghai Province, to discuss current affairs. It is said: At that time, General Ma Bufang firmly stated that he was unwilling to accept the constraints of the future Kuomintang-Communist peace agreement.

Regarding the equipment of the Qinghai army, Ma Bufang admitted that there was a lack of artillery units, and the types of light weapons were very diverse, making supply difficult, and there were no ammunition factories in the entire Northwest.

### During the Meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Financial and Economic Committee, Liu Gongyun Reports on Finance: The Government Holds Huge Amounts of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Exchange; There Is No Risk of Economic Collapse Within a Year

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] When Finance Minister Liu Gongyun attended the Legislative Yuan's Financial and Economic Committee on the morning of the 4th to report on finance, he admitted that the current financial situation is indeed facing difficulties, and the deterioration of the economy is deepening and is very worrying. However, the government is currently working hard in three areas: (1) increasing revenue (increasing income), (2) reducing expenditure (reducing expenditure), and (3) making up for the shortfall (borrowing foreign debt). If one of these three items can be resolved, a fundamental reform can be considered. At present, due to various difficulties, it is actually difficult to fundamentally solve these three problems. We can only start by maintaining the status quo and preventing the economy from continuing to deteriorate. When reporting, Liu based his report on the financial and financial sections of the Executive Yuan's policy guidelines, explaining them item by item, and especially focusing on the three issues of increasing income, reducing expenditure, and making up for the shortfall. Regarding the part about increasing income, Liu pointed out that in the past, merchants often postponed the payment of taxes, which affected tax revenue and expenditure by 4%. Therefore, it was decided to change the collection of tariffs to customs dollars and create tax dollars so that tax revenue would not be affected by price fluctuations and currency depreciation. Currently, efforts are being made to rectify tax revenue. Regarding the part about reducing expenditure, Liu pointed out that before the fundamental situation changes, the general advocacy of layoffs, downsizing, and military cuts must wait until three to five months later to have an effect. At the time of layoffs and downsizing, only expenditures will increase. For example, cutting 200,000 troops will require an additional 100 billion yuan in severance pay. As for making up for the shortfall, only borrowing, borrowing from the United States, and silver matters are still under negotiation. Although there is hope, there is no definite certainty. Levying property tax is also a way to make up for the shortfall, but it is impossible to predict the future effect. Liu then discussed the issuance of gold yuan certificates, saying: As of the end of March, the number of certificates issued was 200 billion yuan, which is three times more than in February. If the situation continues to deteriorate in April and maintains the situation of increasing three times in March, then the issuance must increase by 600 billion yuan. The expenditure for April is estimated to reach 800 billion yuan, which must be made up for in other ways. It is hoped that 400 billion yuan can be recovered by selling gold, silver, and foreign exchange, so that the economic situation will not deteriorate further. During the Kong-Song era, the policy of selling at low prices was adopted in an attempt to stabilize the entire financial system, but it ultimately failed. The purpose of the current selling policy is to recover gold yuan, so the policy of high prices has been adopted. At this point, Liu solemnly declared that the total value of the gold, silver, and foreign exchange held by the government still reaches more than US$200 million. If the issuance in March was 200 billion yuan, only US$10 million is needed to recover all the gold yuan certificates. In the future, if US$15 million is sold every month, the government's gold, silver, and foreign exchange holdings can still support it for a year. Therefore, there is no risk of economic collapse within a year. As for the shortage of banknotes, the situation is indeed very serious in some areas, but it is believed that it can be resolved after a week. After Liu's report, Legislative Committee members Li Shijun, Wang Lihang, and others raised questions one after another. The comprehensive opinions were: (1) The policy of selling at high prices stimulates prices and is a "doing business" method, which should be corrected; (2) Tariffs and other tax revenues are calculated in customs dollars and tax dollars, indicating that the government itself does not trust gold yuan; (3) Those who have money should contribute money and use the assets of wealthy families; (4) How much gold, silver, and foreign exchange does the government hold from the people? How will it be used? Wang Lihang strongly stated that all the speculative and opportunistic behavior in Shanghai is mostly led by national agencies, and should be thoroughly rectified. Until about 12:00 noon, Liu, in addition to giving oral answers, also stated that he would answer the Legislative Committee's questions in detail in writing.

### The Case of Reforming National Financial Institutions: Listed on the Legislative Yuan's Agenda Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The case of reforming national financial institutions proposed by Legislative Committee member Wang Lihang and 166 others advocates reorganizing the Central Bank and the Bank of China, abolishing the Communications Bank, the Farmers Bank, and institutions such as the Cooperative Treasury, the Trust Bureau, and the Savings and Remittance Bureau, so as to permanently eliminate the encroachment of wealthy families, save the economic collapse, stabilize financial prices, and rescue the people from suffering. The Legislative Yuan has listed it on the agenda of the eleventh meeting on the 5th. For this reason, Wang sent a letter to Executive Yuan President He Yingqin and Finance Minister Liu Gongyun on the 4th, asking them to adopt it.

### The Case of Liu Weizhi's Corruption and Embezzlement: Two More Pieces of Solid Evidence Obtained in Guangzhou; The Supervisory Yuan May File an Impeachment Within Days

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] He Jizhou, a Supervisory Committee member who went to Guangzhou to investigate the case of Liu Weizhi's corruption and embezzlement, returned to Nanjing a few days ago. After returning to Nanjing, he went to Shanghai for investigation and has now returned to Nanjing from Shanghai. According to the investigation results of Committee Member He in Guangzhou, in addition to the unauthorized withdrawal of public funds in Shanghai when Liu Weizhi was Minister of Industry and Commerce, which was investigated by Yu Peihou and others, Liu also borrowed two sums of public funds in Guangzhou, one being 10 million yuan in emergency expenses for civil servants received from the Ministry of Finance, which was not used up, and the other being 10 million yuan borrowed from the China Textile Corporation. This 10 million yuan was sealed for ten days and then unsealed again. Liu is suspected of serious exploitation. After Committee Member He investigated, he obtained conclusive evidence. After Committee Member Yu Peihou and others who went to Shanghai for investigation return to Nanjing, He will discuss whether to file an impeachment based on the investigation data, which may be filed within two or three days.

### Joint Land, Sea, and Air Strike on Communist Forces: Anqing Achieves Unprecedented Victory; Stalemate on the Pinghan Railway Indicates Major Battle Brewing

[Our Wuhu Dispatch, 4th] The Anqing battle saw no changes on the 4th. According to military estimates, since the start of the battle thirteen days ago, the Communist forces have suffered over 20,000 casualties. The National Army, with continuous reinforcements from Yu Zhaolong's troops and several naval vessels, has further solidified its positions.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong is very optimistic about the Anqing battle. He stated that with the close cooperation of the National Army's land, sea, and air forces, the Communist offensive, though fierce, has had absolutely no practical effect.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Military News: The fighting on the outskirts of Anqing was relatively quiet on the 2nd due to overcast weather. On the night of the 2nd, the Communist forces took advantage of the darkness to launch a fierce attack on the outer positions. The fighting was extremely intense. The National Army, with the joint efforts of the land and sea forces, fought back bravely, engaging in a fierce battle throughout the night, killing and wounding over 10,000 Communist soldiers, creating an unprecedented victory in the defense of Anqing. On the 3rd, the Communist forces actively mobilized and deployed reinforcements, increasing their forces on the outskirts of Anqing to 50,000 by evening. They launched another fierce attack on the National Army's positions. The defending troops, under the cover of naval artillery fire, repelled the attacking Communist forces by midnight. On the morning of the 4th, the battle once again became quiet. The National Army is currently still securing its original positions on Lion Mountain, Wulidun, Qipan Mountain, and the Agricultural School on the outskirts of Anqing.

[Our Huayuan Dispatch, 4th] Military News: The Communist forces on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway are retreating southward step by step. Part of Lin Biao's 40th Army has reached Xinyang, but no main Communist forces have been found south of Jigong Mountain. The Communist forces west of Xiaogan on the west side of the railway continued to increase yesterday. The National Army has amassed enough forces on the east, west, and north sides of Xiaogan to strongly fortify the outer positions of Central China's heartland, and public morale is gradually stabilizing.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 4th] The focus of the battle on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway has shifted to the area south of Guangshui to Huayuan on both sides. The front line appeared somewhat quiet today, as if another major battle is brewing. Trains north of Hankou only run to the area north of Xiaogan.

[Our Xiaogan Dispatch, 4th] The National Army now has new deployments on the front line from Jigong Mountain to Huayuan, as well as on both sides of the railway. Some powerful mobile units are stationed in the Guangshui and Huayuan areas. Passenger trains on the Pinghan Railway will resume service between Hankou and Xiaogan starting from the 5th.

### How to Avoid the Reefs of Peace Talks?

Since the government's peace talk representatives flew from Nanjing to Beiping on April 1st, it is reported that they have not yet touched on specific issues. For the first three days, representatives only talked individually with the Communist representatives, supposedly to foster goodwill and avoid things becoming stiff from the outset. It is likely that from today onwards, they may gradually start discussing the topics. It is also heard that the two sides plan to first divide into four small groups – diplomatic, military, political, and economic – to conduct separate consultations. Only after the small groups have made some progress will they formally begin negotiations. Regarding the two proposals made by the government representatives to the Communists: (1) the National and Communist armies should immediately cease fire in place, and (2) a new Political Consultative Conference should be convened first to discuss army reorganization and constitutional amendments, the Communist side, although its chief representative indicated that they could consider them, has not yet responded. According to the latest news last night, the two sides' representatives have decided to formally begin negotiations today. At the same time, the Communists have agreed to cease military offensives during the peace talks, but this remains to be confirmed after the ceasefire order is issued. However, at the same time, the Communist radio has been broadcasting for days, using the Nanjing student-military conflict incident to create irrelevant arguments, denouncing the government led by Acting President Li and Premier He as having no sincerity for peace, and stating that the Communist army "is determined to liberate all of China."

Peace is what everyone hopes for. However, looking at the situation in recent days, with the Communist army pressing closer step by step in the suburbs of Anqing and the southern section of the Pinghan Railway without any relaxation, it is clear that although peace talks have begun, they still lack a peaceful atmosphere. To ensure that the peace talks do not hit any reefs, we, standing from the perspective of the people, must frankly point out several unacceptable facts to draw the attention of both the National and Communist parties, and especially to awaken the vigilance of all compatriots.

First, for peace talks to succeed, they must be able to publicly share the progress and content of the daily talks. Peace talks are a major event related to the life and death of the 400 million people of the country, not a "child's play" for the National and Communist parties. There is no reason why they should be kept secret. Moreover, since both sides of the peace talks believe they are justified, they might as well each state their proposed conditions, methods, and reasons to convince the other party, and let the people listen. To put it crudely, peace talks should not be like what Shanghai people call "having an affair," which needs to be done secretly. Why is it that after the government representatives went north, they listened to the Communist Party's control and arrangements and were unwilling to disclose any information? And why are news reporters from Beijing, Shanghai, and other places not allowed to report the news? Is it possible that what they are talking about is not something that can be seen in broad daylight? It must be known that if there are reefs in peace talks, they must arise from "secrecy." If they become visible reefs, they can be avoided and safety can be guaranteed. The first step has already been taken incorrectly, and we are deeply worried about the future of the peace talks.

Second, for peace talks to succeed, benevolent people's representatives must be allowed to participate in addition to the representatives of the National and Communist parties. Only then can mediation and facilitation achieve considerable results. However, the government representatives are not seeking this, but only know how to create opportunities for the Communist Party. They do not value the opinions of people's organizations in various places, let alone invite people's representatives to participate in the discussions. If there are disputes, it will inevitably lead to everyone arguing their own point of view without any room for maneuver.

Third, for peace talks to succeed, it is natural and righteous to immediately cease all military actions. Not only should there be no more battles on the front line, but all troops on both sides should remain in their original defenses, awaiting reorganization. During the previous Political Consultative Conference, the National Government ordered a ceasefire four times within a year, and each time it was sabotaged by the Communist Party. How can we expect them to agree to a ceasefire today? In the suburbs of Anqing and along the Yangtze River, the Communist army has been attacking for nearly ten days, determined to capture Anqing. At the same time, they are launching a two-pronged attack on the rear and west of Wuhan. Although the government troops are retreating, the Communist army is advancing relentlessly, making gains inch by inch. The Communist army must have the courage of Fu Jian "throwing his whip to stop the flow," attempting to cross the Yangtze River in one fell swoop. The Communist broadcast wants the government's willingness to handle "war criminals" as a touchstone for genuine sincerity for peace.

Fourth, for peace talks to succeed, avoid bringing up irrelevant topics that take the discussion further and further away from the main point. For example, the Atlantic Treaty was signed in Washington yesterday by the foreign ministers of twelve countries, which has nothing to do with China. China is not a country along the Atlantic coast, and there is no need to bring this issue into the scope of the peace talks. However, according to reports, the Communist Party is preparing to add a condition on foreign policy to the peace talks, which is to require the future coalition government to be completely inclined towards the Soviet Union and unanimously oppose the United States and Western European countries. It is difficult to say whether this is the speculation of foreign reporters, but looking at the broadcasts of the Communist radio, the joint statement issued by Mao Zedong, Li Jishen, and others, unanimously opposing the Atlantic Treaty, and openly declaring that they "will unite the people of the whole country, join hands with China's ally, the Soviet Union, and resolutely fight against the instigators of aggressive war to defeat the aggressors," one cannot help but believe that the Communist Party intends to drag China to be the tail of the Soviet Union, running around blindly, and even plunging into the vortex of international war as a form of self-indulgence. If the Communist Party representatives intend to raise this issue in the peace talks, the government representatives, deeply aware of the awesomeness of public opinion, will not dare to agree rashly, and peace may be stranded at this point.

### US Senate Passes Amended Foreign Aid Bill: Prohibits Supplies from Entering Communist Areas; House Discusses Temporary Aid to China Bill; ECA Will Focus on Rural Reconstruction in the Future

[Report] Washington, 4th: The US Senate unanimously passed an amended foreign aid bill, prohibiting US relief supplies from being transported to areas controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. This resolution was passed after Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally announced that the committee did not oppose the amendment. It is unprecedented for the foreign aid bill to clearly stipulate restrictions against the Communist Party.

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] Although the 1948 US Aid to China Act expired on the 3rd, the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) will continue to work hard to promote the aid to China plan, making full use of the remaining $54 million under the Aid to China Act. Future plans will roughly focus on rural reconstruction in the non-Communist areas of China. Moyer, an American member of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, is currently here drafting the budget for the next period (April 1949 to February 1950). The commission is expected to receive $10 million to $15 million. According to Moyer, the committee has only just begun and will make great strides in the future. The committee's work focuses on land reform, irrigation, seed improvement, animal disease prevention, sanitation, family improvement, and public education. The work areas are in Taiwan, Guangxi, Fujian, and Sichuan. In the past year, the committee's expenses have mostly been borne by the Chinese side. In the future, it is planned to rely on the United States. The purpose of land reform is to transfer land from large landlords to individual landowners. Landlords and farmers can cooperate well on this. Once the land reform plan is completed, the living standards of farmers can be improved. In terms of irrigation, the commission has received various proposals from the Chinese side and will review them soon.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Gu Bonian, Special Representative of the ECA China Mission and Director of the Nanjing Office, announced on the 4th that as of April 2nd, Nanjing had received $3,579,307.50 in US aid. The most important part of this aid was the supply of rice for rationing in Nanjing, totaling 246,169.5 shi of Siamese rice, with a total value of $3,200,333.50, which has been distributed together with the rice borrowed by the Chinese government.

### The Xiangxi Issue Enters a New Stage: Song Xilian Has Full Authority; Appointed Military and Political Governor of the Xiang-E-Chuan-Qian Border Area; Chen Mingren's Corps Takes Over the Defense of Yi-Sha

[Our Changsha Dispatch, 4th] Song Xilian's corps designation has been revoked and changed to the Office of the Military and Political Governor of the Xiang-E-Chuan-Qian Border Area, located in Changde, responsible for the defense of the border areas of the four provinces and with full authority to handle the Xiangxi issue. Chen Mingren's corps, which recently moved to Changde, will be transferred to Yi-Sha to take over Song's corps' defense area. It is heard that Song plans to reorganize the scattered civilian guns and armies in various counties of Xiangxi. Luo Wenjie, who has potential influence in Xiangxi, will reportedly join Song's staff to plan the resolution of the Xiangxi issue.

[Our Changsha Dispatch, 4th] Liu Jiashu, Chief of Staff of the Pacification Headquarters, went from Yuanjiang to Chenxi on the 3rd. Chen Yulin, commander of the newly recruited Second Suppression Column, greeted him 30 li outside the city. Chenxi has good order, shops are open as usual, and prices are low. Li Jingyi in Wugang has a clear attitude and is willing to comply with orders to stop activities. The Pacification Headquarters may grant him the designation of Suppression Column. As for Yin Liyan, he will be eliminated. Hongjiang and Anjiang are still safe due to effective defense.

[Our Changsha Dispatch, 4th] A person from Ningxiang reported that the local Communist forces led by Jiang Yaxun in the county have recently joined forces with Chen Zhongyi and others, numbering nearly 3,000 people with over 1,000 guns. They have sent Liu Meifu and others to be responsible for training military and political cadres, adopting the style of the "Liberation Army"

### Instability on the Guizhou Border: Bandits Scour from Yunnan, Guangxi, and Hunan

[Our Guiyang Dispatch, 4th] Luoping and Shizong in southeastern Yunnan, adjacent to Xingyi County in southwestern Guizhou, have recently been organized by Zhang Tianlu and Zhuang Yan from the Communist area in Luoping to form a people's government and have scoured to Xingyi, Xingren, and other counties. More than 6,000 bandits are entrenched in Huangni River at the junction of the two provinces. Two-thirds of the townships in Xingyi County have been lost, and the situation is serious. Geshang Town, 40 li away from the county seat, fell on the 1st, and people are panic-stricken. Fortunately, the bandit forces in Panxian and Puan have been suppressed, and the provincial security teams have gradually moved south to intercept and suppress them. Chen Mengsi's division of the National Army, which arrived in Guiyang last month, has also been ordered to reinforce. In Ceheng and Wangmo on the Guizhou-Guangxi border, Guangxi bandits frequently enter and exit. The commander of the Guizhou-Guangxi Joint Defense arrived in Baise from Liuzhou on March 22 to supervise the security teams to suppress the bandits on the border. The Guizhou provincial government has ordered all counties in the province to cooperate in the attack. In Tongren Yangtousi and Yuping Huangdaopu in eastern Guizhou, 600 to 700 bandits from Xiangxi sneaked in at the end of March. After being blocked by Commissioner Xia and the provincial security team, they have recently been driven out of the border.

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 4th] The Gansu provincial government received a report that farmers in a certain county in Hexi bought a villager for 5,000 silver coins and planned to throw him into the river god in March of the lunar calendar to pray for increased water volume. In order to eradicate superstition, the provincial government has ordered the county to thoroughly investigate and prevent it.

### Corruption Case of Qingdao Garrison Headquarters Personnel: More Shocking Discoveries; Senior Officials Involved in Drug Trafficking Case; Dismissed Chief of Staff Has Been Placed Under Surveillance

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 4th] As our newspaper continues to investigate the corruption case of Qingdao Garrison Headquarters personnel, more shocking discoveries have been made. According to sources, this case broke a branch of a large drug trafficking organization, and other senior officials are involved.

According to sources, the drug trafficking organization is the Yuanfeng Aquatic Products Store at No. 69 Jinxiang Road. The main culprits, Song Shaochu, Liu Pinsan, and Yu Xihou, have been arrested and detained. Song is the manager. Another deputy manager, surnamed Han, returned to Yuanfeng the day after Song and others were arrested, using a pre-prepared fake ID card to deceive the military and police and resisted arrest with force when he was detained. The ten sacks of gold yuan notes seized at the Xiaogang checkpoint were related to this store and were transported by wooden boat from Haixi to Qingdao. Manager Song was usually generous and had wide connections, colluding with unscrupulous officers and soldiers. Based on the clues found in the gold yuan notes, the Garrison Headquarters' Chief of Staff Huang Gonglu immediately issued an order to search the store that night. Military, police, and military police jointly surrounded No. 69 Jinxiang Road and searched the houses one by one.

"Don't Want Gold, Just Want Your Head"

Song and others knew that things were not good. They immediately opened the silver box, revealing gold, US dollars, and silver dollars, the amount of which was inestimable, with a total value of hundreds of taels. They said, "Don't worry, everyone, please take whatever you want." The search personnel, knowing that Song and others had a "gangster style" and were quite "stuck in a rut," further confirmed the truth. Song also listed the names of certain people who had dealings with them. He then took out 50 taels of gold as a bribe. The search personnel said it was too little. Song added another 50 taels. They said it was still too little. Song asked how much they wanted. They replied that this case was too big and they wanted his head. Song said that if that was the case, he could only go with them. He was then arrested, and a bill for trading opium with the East China Trade Bureau of the Communist area was found. The main destination was Shanghai.

Business Cards and Loans: Clues

Hundreds of business cards were also confiscated, mostly from local figures, requesting loans of tens of thousands to meet urgent needs. The dates were mostly at the end of the lunar year, providing clues. The exposure of the supervisory chief Zhang Tong and others' concealment of the number of gold yuan notes and embezzlement was also the result of Song's connections. They originally planned to get it back, but the attempt backfired, embarrassing many people. Yu Jingchen, the chief of the checkpoint, once fled but then surrendered. His confession of the embezzlement process was as long as fifty pages of ten-line paper, stating that he only received one tael of gold. As for how to distribute the concealed funds, it was all instructed by Chief of Staff Huang Gonglu. Zhang Tong's gold, US dollars, and other evidence were confiscated from him during the interrogation. Chief of Staff Huang Gonglu was nominally transferred to the Suiyuan District as a senior staff officer, but he has actually been placed under surveillance.

Smuggling Incidents Emerge One After Another

Also, smuggling incidents between Qingdao and the Communist areas seem to be emerging one after another. Just as one wave subsides, another rises. One night, the navy intercepted a steamship in Jiaozhou Bay, fully loaded with telecommunications equipment. They checked it. It was claimed that the Suiyuan District Economic Office had issued a visa to transport goods to Haixi to exchange with the Communist area. The people and ship have been detained. The evidence of the goods leaving the country does not seem to be forged, but the Economic Office denies issuing the visa. The case is under development.

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 4th] The Lanzhou Central Bank received 500 million yuan in thousand-yuan notes from Shanghai on the 3rd, which was the largest transfer ever.

### Children's Day Disturbance: Children Riot in Suzhou; Grand Event Ended Unhappily

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 4th] The local education authorities held a Children's Day celebration in the Suzhou Grand Theatre in Beiju on the 4th. However, the number of attendees was not properly controlled beforehand, which caused dissatisfaction among the children. They rioted in Beiju, vandalized the advertising boards outside the theatre, and the celebration ended unhappily. After the meeting started at 9:00 AM, the theatre doors were locked. However, more than 600 children gathered outside the door and were unable to enter. They started clamoring, knocking on the iron doors, sounding like gunshots.

### Signing of the Atlantic Treaty Completed: Truman Delivers a Speech Reaffirming That the Treaty Aims to Defend Against Aggression; Willing to Abide by the Principles of the United Nations Charter

[Our Dispatch] Washington, 4th Broadcast: President Truman, in his speech at the signing ceremony of the North Atlantic Treaty, stated that it was his good fortune to welcome the foreign ministers of various countries to jointly establish the unity of the North Atlantic nations on this historic occasion. The purpose of today's meeting is to enable this international agreement to fulfill its task of safeguarding the security and prosperity of the signatory countries. What we have signed is a "neighborly treaty." The text of this treaty is very clear. The signatory countries are willing to abide by the peaceful principles of the United Nations, to live in friendship with all countries, and to provide economic assistance to each other. In the event that the territory or independence of any country is threatened, they will consult on how to respond and provide assistance to the victim of aggression. This treaty is a simple document, but if it had existed in 1914 and 1939 and had the support of the countries gathered here today, I believe it would have prevented the two world wars of those years. Most of us participated in the founding of the United Nations, and every member state has an obligation to maintain international peace and security and to seek peaceful solutions to international disputes. We reaffirm these guarantees and obligations here today. We rededicate ourselves to these obligations and propose that this North Atlantic Treaty be one way to fulfill these obligations. We are adopting this treaty in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter to address international issues. We use the right of collective or individual self-defense to resist armed attacks and maintain international peace and security.

[United Press, Washington, 4th Dispatch] The United States, Britain, France, and nine non-Communist countries today signed the historic North Atlantic Security Treaty, which is the final guarantee of joint defense against any aggressor and a clear warning to Communist Soviet Union. Once the treaty is ratified, the US border defense will move to the center of Europe for at least twenty years. The signing ceremony was held at 3:00 PM standard time on the 4th (4:00 AM on the 5th Shanghai time) in the Government Auditorium on Constitution Avenue, not far from the White House. Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak will be the first to sign the treaty, followed by the foreign ministers of the other eleven countries. US Secretary of State Acheson, as the host, will first deliver a five-minute introductory speech. After the foreign ministers of each country deliver short speeches, President Truman will deliver a speech as a guest to complete the ceremony. No fewer than 1,300 cabinet members, officials, diplomatic envoys, members of Congress, and journalists from various countries were invited to attend.

[United Press, Washington, 4th Dispatch] The signing of the North Atlantic Treaty today may trigger new dangers in the East-West Cold War. When the UN General Assembly meets in New York tomorrow, the Soviet Union will immediately have a great opportunity to openly attack the treaty. It is expected that Soviet Chief Representative Gromyko will again display his eloquence. Diplomats speculate that the Soviet Union may adjust its policies or take actions in the future to overthrow the Atlantic Treaty or make it fail. The Soviet Union may take some practical actions to test the effectiveness of the new treaty. Its provocations will be indirect, such as actions in Finland and the Middle East. Responsible officials do not believe that the Soviet Union will risk war with the West at this time, but some people believe that if the Soviet Union intends to wage war or believes that it has the power to launch a war, it will definitely strike first before the new Atlantic defense organization is fully established. Well-informed sources believe that the Soviet Union will use war intimidation to divide the text alignment.

### UN General Assembly Opens Today: Australian Foreign Minister Evatt Personally Presides; The Issue of Italian Territories is the Most Explosive

[Reuters, New York, 3rd Dispatch] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, President of the United Nations General Assembly, arrived here today to preside over the opening ceremony of the General Assembly on the 5th. He told reporters at the airport that he attached great importance to this General Assembly. People all over the world are thirsty for peace, and the only organization that can help achieve peace is the United Nations organization. Although the Atlantic Treaty and others are helpful in achieving peace, their role is only to assist the United Nations organization.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 3rd Dispatch] The main items of the twenty-three agenda items to be discussed at this General Assembly are as follows: (1) Dealing with colonial territories, (2) the Spanish issue, (3) the case of Hungarian Bishop Mindszenty and other Hungarian clergymen being falsely accused, (4) the issue of limiting the use of the veto power, (5) establishing a United Nations army, (6) freedom of the press, (7) allowing Israel to join the United Nations.

Among them, the issues of Italy and Spain are the most explosive.

### British and Italian Foreign Ministers Hold Talks

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] Foreign Minister Bevin today discussed the issue of Italian colonies with Italian Foreign Minister Sforza here. Related parties believe that the disposal of Italian Tripoli is still the crux of the Italian colonial issue. The difficulty lies in having to obtain some kind of solution that can be accepted by the United Nations and other related countries. In addition to the four countries of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France, those who feel a direct interest in the disposal of Italian colonies include Egypt, Abyssinia, Italy, South Africa, and various Arab countries. Acheson recently held talks with the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and Italy, and almost focused on finding a formula for solving the issue of Tripoli. It is said that whether the Italian colonies are governed by one country or entrusted to several countries under the United Nations, it is bound to be done through international cooperation to improve the economic and social standards of the local natives.

### Denmark and Norway Join the Treaty: The Soviet Union Sends a Protest, The Wording Is the Same As the Note to the Seven Countries

[Associated Press, Copenhagen, 4th Dispatch] The Soviet Union sent a note to Denmark and Norway on the 4th, stating that the Soviet Union believes that the Atlantic Treaty is aggressive and aimed at the Soviet Union. The note is the same as the note sent by the Soviet Union to the seven initiators of the Atlantic Treaty on April 1. According to reports, the foreign ministers of the twelve Atlantic Treaty signatory countries, including Norway and Denmark, issued a joint statement in Washington on the 2nd, frankly rejecting the Soviet Union's protest. They denied that the purpose of this treaty was to oppose the Soviet Union. They stated that this treaty is entirely defensive and aims to protect against attacks by other countries.

### Defending the Security of the Middle East: Iran's Position Is Important; Relations Between the Soviet Union and Iran Are Becoming Increasingly Tense

[United Press, Tehran, 3rd Dispatch] Relations between Iran and the Soviet Union are becoming increasingly tense, and there is a danger of imminent conflict. According to a treaty signed between the two countries more than twenty years ago, if Iran becomes a base for military action against the Soviet Union, the Soviet army has the right to enter Iranian territory. Iran's position is on the left flank of Turkey. Once lost, Truman's policy of passive observation in Turkey and Greece will immediately collapse.

### The City Government Held a Monthly Meeting Yesterday Morning: The Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Reported on the Work Situation

[Our Dispatch] The city government held a monthly meeting yesterday morning, presided over by Secretary-General Chen Liang. After the leadership performed their duties, Cao Peizi, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, gave a work report, stating briefly: (1) The backlog of sealed materials is being actively processed, and a considerable percentage has been completed. (2) For the price management of daily necessities, the price of economic meals is based on the price of rice, divided into grades, and reasonably adjusted. For the hotel industry, after the base number is approved, a small number of colleagues have failed to implement it thoroughly, and actual investigations have been added to make reasonable approvals of the various base numbers. The price base number for the barber industry has been determined to be divided into five grades and ten levels, and it was implemented on the 25th of last month, with good results. A solution has not yet been found for the price of bathhouses and is currently being approved. There are many reasons for the fluctuating rice prices in this city. The government is working from three aspects: "releasing," "rationing," and "guiding." On the one hand, it is seeking to strengthen the rice rationing system and is working hard to guide the source of food. It is believed that when rice rationing begins tomorrow, rice prices may tend to stabilize. (3) In terms of labor administration: There were very few labor-capital disputes before March 15. In the second half of March, due to the cash panic, there were more than 30 dispute cases. Fortunately, both labor and management were able to overcome difficulties together and accept government mediation. After the Labor Hospital opened its clinic, the content still needs to be enriched. A factory employee welfare association has been established to actively promote it. (4) In terms of relief and culture: The winter relief work has ended. Recently, in order to handle the reception of refugee students from North China and Tianjin, we are cooperating with the Education Bureau. The first batch of 500 refugees have been sent to Jiangxi for resettlement, and the second batch of about 1,000 people will be sent soon. A total of 27 kinds of illegal publications have been banned in this city, 3 have been suspended, 3 have been warned, and more than 100 registration certificates have been revoked for overdue non-publication. Other activities such as enriching public fund, improving business, and restoring small loans are being actively carried out separately.

However, the general feeling of difficulty is that because the interest rate on borrowing is too high, factories are unwilling to borrow money to purchase raw materials. Usually, they sell a portion of their products to purchase raw materials. Therefore, most of the current industrial raw materials are in the hands of vendors or importers. They hope that low-interest industrial loans can be realized as soon as possible to facilitate the storage and purchase of raw materials. In order to further understand the situation of each industry, the Social Affairs Bureau decided to create a survey form, including the quantity and type of raw materials. The various industries will be divided into: (1) daily necessities, (2) electrical machinery, (3) chemical industry, and (4) textile industry, and they will be required to fill out the forms separately, collect the statistics, and then determine the method. It is said that the principle is that each factory must store at least six months' worth of raw materials to facilitate production.

### Twenty-Nine Industrial Trade Associations Urge the Realization of North-South Trade; Propose Two Opinions to State the Attitude of the Industrial Sector

The Machine, Cotton Textile, Dyeing and Weaving, Rubber, Paper Making, and other twenty-nine industrial trade associations in this city yesterday jointly submitted a petition to the Municipal Industrial Association to urge the government to promote the realization of trade between the North and South and the exchange of materials between the two places. They presented seven reasons, stating from the perspectives of industry, people's livelihood, economy, and foreign exchange that opening up trade between the North and South is an urgent matter. Among them, they proposed two opinions, stating the attitude of the industrial sector on this matter: (1) The government only stipulates which goods can be transported north and which goods can be transported south, and allows the people to directly manage it. (2) It should be stated that the government does not aim to benefit financially from trade between the North and South except for collecting taxes in accordance with regulations. The materials exchanged from the North should be distributed and used by the industrial and commercial sectors themselves, and state-owned agencies should never handle them. It is reported that the Municipal Industrial Association will hold a meeting to discuss the matter and then forward it to the government for adoption.

### Ancient Tomb in Changzhou Ready for Excavation

— Our Correspondent Li Tianxing

[Report from our Newspaper, Wugang, 3rd] The discovery of an ancient tomb in Yunjiadun, Qinglong Bridge, in the southern suburbs of Changzhou, has spread far and wide with the spring breeze. However, due to the frequent winds and rains in spring, which have soaked the fields, and the tense military situation in the area, with conscription of soldiers and grain creating considerable stress, the excavation work has been delayed. Now, the second excavation meeting has decided to invite experts from Shanghai and Nanjing, such as Jiang Dayi, Yang Kuanzheng, and Mr. Zeng Zhaoyu from the Nanjing Central Museum Research Institute, on the 9th of this month for a definitive excavation meeting. Thirty dan of rice will be allocated as the initial excavation cost, assuming there are no other complications. The official excavation can begin as early as the 10th!

For the past two weeks, local dignitaries, visiting experts, and ordinary villagers have been discussing this mysterious ancient tomb, their comments as varied as the "noisy stage gongs" before the curtain rises on a play, both moving and endearing. To search, to collect, to piece it together, to record it word by word, to glean from ancient culture – this is the motivation for me to write this article.

The Outline of Qinglong Bridge

Leaving the Small South Gate and following the current Wuyi Road for about a little over a li, you arrive at the countryside of Qinglong Bridge! In the past, this area was commonly known as Chashan Road, with three tea pavilions called First, Second, and Third Tea Pavilion. "Ten li of long pavilions, the setting sun over the ancient road." Gazing from the slopes, the desolate atmosphere that one would expect in the countryside is pervasive. Mounds of desolate tombs, green grass and wheat – it is easy to recall the past of the ancient city and naturally "arouse ancient feelings"! Qinglong Bridge no longer has a bridge! The surrounding area is crisscrossed by fields, with flat hills and shallow mounds scattered around. Yunjiadun is a relatively prominent and large tomb mound nearby. Less than a hundred paces west of the mound is a small village called Yunjia Village. Northwest of the mound is the Qinglong Bridge Elementary School, which was originally the local land temple. Several gilded Buddha statues are still preserved. This place is not entirely desolate, but it carries a hint of desolation.

The discovery of the ancient tomb was accidental. According to the residents of Yunjia Village, at the end of last year, the 52nd Army was stationed in Changzhou and took a fancy to this high tomb. They dug deep trenches and built fortifications on it. When they dug more than a zhang deep, they discovered a large number of bricks and stones, and the work stopped. This New Year, nearby villagers discovered many bricks and took them for their own use, digging up more and more. The villagers were naive, only knowing that the bricks could be used to repair the ground or walls, and they didn't care about "ancient." But unintentionally, the first chamber of the ancient tomb was ruthlessly dug out by them, and they didn't know what was going on. At the time, it was said that ancient coins and bronze swords were found, but everything was covered in mud, moldy, and rotten, so everyone carelessly discarded them!

On March 12, the construction of the fortifications resumed. During the excavation, a second archway was suddenly discovered, and a glimpse of a tomb chamber inside was seen. This is when the name "ancient tomb" began to spread. On the 15th, reporters from local newspapers rushed to visit, and the entire city flocked to watch. The county government and the garrison headquarters officially began to protect the site and plan the excavation.

Strange Patterns on the Ancient Tomb Bricks

The currently discovered ancient tomb is generally said to be the second chamber of the tomb. The first chamber was unintentionally dug out by the villagers for bricks. The entrance to the second chamber is arched, facing south. It is about three chi wide and over four chi high. Inside is a room about five or six chi square. The room is extremely damp, and the ground is filled with broken mud. There are no bottom bricks. The top is entirely made of bricks laid sideways, with clear, elegant, and profound patterns. On the front wall is an entrance, and on the east wall is also an entrance, slightly lower than the front one. Both entrances are tightly packed with bricks laid sideways and have not yet been excavated.

Regarding the tomb bricks, I have seen three types of patterns. The bricks are all rectangular, with equal width, thickness, and height (see our newspaper on the 31st). All the tomb bricks have the distinct impression of being specially made or custom-made. The patterns are largely the same, featuring layered banana leaf patterns and overlapping herringbone patterns. See the attached diagram. The text on the ancient coin pattern has not yet been definitively determined. According to Professor Jiang Dayi of Tongji University, it may be "Da Quan Wu Bai" (Great Coin Five Hundred) or "Da Quan Wu Qian" (Great Coin Five Thousand). However, "Quan" may be an abbreviated form of "Quan" (spring). "Da Quan Wu Bai" and "Da Quan Wu Qian" were both currencies minted by Sun Quan, Emperor Da of the Three Kingdoms Wu, in the fifth year of the Jiahe reign. If this is the case, then this tomb must be after Sun Quan. According to Wang Shouxiang's research, the character "Mu" (eye) has an extra horizontal stroke, which is the ancient character "Liang" (good). "Liang Quan" also has the meaning of Tong Bao (circulating treasure). The claw shape is suspected to be half of the character "Feng" (phoenix). Therefore, if it records weight, it would be "Wu Zhu Liang Quan" (Five Zhu Good Coin), and if it records the reign year, it would be "Wu Feng Liang Quan" (Five Phoenix Good Coin), which also makes sense. Chen Fengyuan also stated that the inscription on the brick pattern says, "Each of the two circles contains four characters, but only three characters are clear. One is 'Wu' (five), one is 'Quan' (coin), and one is 'Mu' (eye) with an extra horizontal stroke. According to this, it is the ancient character 'Liang' (good) and cannot be interpreted as 'Bai' (hundred). The ancient form of the character 'Bai' (hundred) consists of 'Yi' (one) and 'Zi' (self), unlike the ancient form of 'Liang' (good), which has three horizontal strokes added to a long frame, as seen in inscriptions on metal and stone. In Zhuangzi's Lie Yukou, it says, '　Hu looked at the ancestral hall and saw its Liang, making it the fruit of autumn cypress,' and the commentary explains, 'Liang means good person, or it can be written as Yin, pronounced Lang, meaning mound.' If the blurred character is 'Da' (great), 'Da' (great) is also the ancient character for 'Ren' (person). Therefore, combining these four characters should be 'Wu Ren Quan Liang' (Five Persons Whole Good), meaning 'Five People Whole Family' or 'Whole Family Five People'." There are currently several studies on the textual research.

Yang Yourun's Views

A local gentleman named Yang Yourun, who works in the History, Language, and Archaeology Group of the Central Research Institute, has expressed nine opinions. (1) The overlapping herringbone shape on the edge of the brick is unique to Han tombs. (2) It has been discovered in the eastern nine provinces and Gansu. This proves that this pattern was a Han Dynasty fashion and was widely spread. (3) There are many ancient coin patterns on Han tomb bricks, but the ones discovered at Qinglong Bridge have never been seen before. (4) The characters on the bricks have never been seen before, so it is impossible to accurately determine the era. (5) The use of coin patterns on Han tomb bricks was a fashion at the time and does not necessarily mean it belonged to an emperor or general. (6) The ancient coin characters on the bricks do not necessarily match the era of the deceased. It is also not necessarily the style of currency used at the time. (7) From a general observation, the ancient tomb outside the South Gate should be a Han tomb, or not far from the Han Dynasty. (8) This tomb may have already been robbed. (9) A robbed tomb still has excavation value. The ancient tomb area outside the South Gate is extremely wide and does not seem to be a burial site for ordinary people. In addition, Cao Boru, based on historical and customary evidence, believes that the tomb may be the tomb of Yang Yun. Lu Chunyuan said that since this mound is called Yunjiadun, it should be related to the Yun family. The inscription on the Huangshan Temple Stele says, "Our Yun family's first generation, Lord Zhen Dao, Prime Minister of Liang in the Han Dynasty, came from Anding to live in Piling." This means that the Yun family had moved to Changzhou since the Han Dynasty. The Yun family has its own lineage and should not be confused with "Yang Yun." The tomb of Yang Yun is probably not credible.

Signs of Ancient Mausoleums

According to Wang Shouxiang's tomb research: The Wujin County Gazetteer and the Changzhou Prefecture Gazetteer both record the locations of ancient mausoleums. The Wushi Gazetteer says that Emperor Gao of Qi's Tai'an Mausoleum is in Tongjiang Township, Emperor Wu's Jing'an Mausoleum, Emperor Ming's Yu'an Mausoleum, and Emperor Jian of Liang Wu's father and daughter are all recorded in the township, but their exact locations are unknown. The Changzhou Prefecture Gazetteer states that Qi's Tai'an Mausoleum is on Pengshan in Tongjiang Township, Jing'an Mausoleum is where Qi Emperor Wu was buried, and Xing'an Mausoleum is where Qi Emperor Ming and Empress Jing Liu were buried. The Xingdi Gazetteer says that Tai'an, Jing'an, and Xing'an three mausoleums are in the northeast of the former Lanling, Jinniu Mountain. All the above-mentioned mausoleums, this place (referring to the southern suburbs) may be the sleeping mausoleum of Emperor Gao of Southern Qi. Emperor Gao's name was Xiao Daocheng, a native of Nanlanling (Wujin was formerly known as Nanlanling). He ascended the throne in the fourth year of Jianyuan of the Southern History and was buried in Tai'an Mausoleum in Wujin in April. The Prefecture Gazetteer records that the three mausoleums of Tai'an, Jing'an, and Xing'an are all in the northeast of the former Lanling. It is said that the ancient Lanling was located in the southern suburbs of today's city, so the southern suburbs of today's city may be the northeast of the former Lanling city. The name Qinglong Bridge may also be named because of the Xiao Mausoleum. The above are all preliminary investigations. All the abstracts are compiled and reported, which can be used as reference materials for future days.

### Changzhou Prison Break Case; Fugitive Zhan Fang Apprehended; Thousand-Word Confession

[Report from our Newspaper, Wujin, 2nd] The unprecedented prison break occurred in this county on the evening of February 25th. After a long investigation by the criminal police team, it was learned that one of the fugitives, Jin Fang, was hiding in the Jiaxing Traffic Police Force, acting as a police officer. At the beginning of this month, Zhuang, the captain of the criminal police team, led officers to arrest him and brought him back to Changzhou on the afternoon of the 2nd. The prisoner is quite literate and drafted a confession of a thousand words, detailing the inside story of the prison break. It briefly stated that the incident was initiated by Huang Ming, the district chief of the Communist Party, and two others, who colluded with Director Guo and Director Wu in advance. When the release was opened, Director Guo smiled and personally called Chen Bingchang's name (one of the escaped prisoners) at Gate No. 7, then opened the door to let him escape. Jin Fang followed him out and saw Director Wu standing next to the main gate, with the warden also present. After Jin escaped, he tried to find connections and rejoined the old unit, while the others' whereabouts were unknown. Finally, he stated that he was originally from Guangdong and had been in the military since he was young, fighting on the battlefield for a long time and participating in the "January 28th" and "August 13th" battles. He believed that he was loyal to the party and the country and would never associate with the Communist Party. He escaped from prison this time due to temporary confusion and originally hoped to rehabilitate himself, so he returned to the old organization to atone for his previous mistakes. If he is not considered useless, he can be transferred to military service, and he will do his best until his death.

### Reader Consultation Legal Clarification; Dissatisfied with Parents' Arranged Marriage; Plans to Dissolve After Reaching Adulthood; Answered by Lawyer Tang Mingshi

Wang Huimin asks: A man, A, is currently 20 years old. A woman, B, is currently 15 years old. In the summer of 1945, B's mother passed away, and her family did not take responsibility for her upbringing. Through an introduction, she was engaged to A and entered A's house as a "child bride." This matter was decided by A's father, and A himself never agreed to it. Now that A has reached adulthood, if he decides to dissolve this marriage, please answer:

Can A directly entrust a lawyer to declare the termination of the contract and order B to return to her family? Does B have the right to demand compensation for losses?

[Answer] Without the consent of the parties involved, minors and those reaching adulthood can claim termination of the contract. Regarding A's father adopting B, if A claims termination of the contract, expelling B is not only unreasonable but also legally untenable to shirk responsibility. Therefore, A can claim termination of the contract; A's father should recognize B as an adopted daughter. Then the second question will not arise.

### Tightening Credit to Curb Inflation; National Bank Resumes Full-Scale Selling; Overnight Interest Rate 200 Yuan Higher Outside the Customs Yesterday Afternoon

[Report from our Newspaper] The Financial Stabilization Committee of the Central Bank convened its regular meeting in the conference room of the Bank of China yesterday morning. The discussion resulted in a decision to resume the full-scale selling policy in order to stabilize the potential rise in prices on the market after the issuance of large banknotes and the salary payment period. In terms of goods, in addition to the large-scale selling of cotton yarn by the National Bank and the US Aid Flower and Yarn Associated Office, and the large-scale sale of sugar by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, the Central Bank also resumed unlimited supply and sale of gold in the gold market yesterday. The supply was unlimited according to the needs of the market. As a result, more than 6,000 large bars were sold, setting a new record since the selling policy was implemented. All parties' appetites reached saturation, leading to a rise in the daily overnight interest rate from 60-70 yuan in the morning to over 200 yuan outside the customs around 3:00-4:00 PM. Credit was unprecedentedly tight. According to a related official from the National Bank, "If some banks and firms take in a large number of gold bars and do not find a way to make up for it later, more than ten firms will inevitably face closure due to their inability to balance their positions."

Furthermore, Lin Chongyong, Director of the Business Bureau of the National Bank, responded to reporters' inquiries yesterday with a victorious smile. He said, "No matter how big the market's appetite is, we have decided to supply as much as possible today. If they eat until their stomachs burst, that is not our fault!" Then, Mr. Lin asked reporters, "How are prices today?" All reporters reported that they were falling. Mr. Lin repeatedly said "Good, good" and looked extremely pleased.

[Report from our Newspaper] Credit was not tight yesterday morning, with the daily overnight interest rate between 70 and 80 yuan per thousand. At 9:50 AM, the price of gold reached its limit, and the National Bank began to sell without limit. Credit tightened, and by 11:00 AM, the daily overnight interest rate had risen to 90-100 yuan. By noon, due to the liquidation of floating positions, the secret interest rate slightly decreased, and the daily overnight interest rate returned to 85-95 yuan. However, the market quickly learned that the National Bank's selling volume was huge, and all industries' positions were tight. It was also rumored that bills could not be used for payment, so the secret interest rate in Shanghai was high. Therefore, the secret interest rate after the close of trading rose to 150-250 yuan per thousand of the daily overnight interest rate, setting an unprecedented record. Some banks were in a precarious situation due to their inability to balance their positions. The National Bank then bought gold at a price of 990 to provide positions, and the secret interest rate decreased slightly, to about 200 yuan of the daily overnight interest rate. It is rumored that two small banks will suspend exchange starting today due to position issues.

### National Banks Vigorously Sell Off, Gold Price Enters Customs at a Million

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the gold market experienced unpredictable fluctuations, with the market trend being volatile and unstable. In the morning, due to the two-day call loan interest rate, the opening price immediately reached the upper limit of 1,256,000, a surge. Amidst this, due to strong market confidence, it stood firm at a high peak for quite some time. Around 11:00 AM, the Central Bank entrusted Dadecheng Gold Firm to sell off unlimitedly at a price of 1,250,000, vigorously releasing as many as 6,163 taels, squeezing into a total of 77.00375 billion. Market confidence softened, and many holders rushed to sell, with retail investors flocking to sell, gradually declining to 1,215,000. The noon closing price slightly rose to 1,220,000.

In the afternoon, due to tight credit conditions and high off-market interest rates reaching around two yuan, buying interest from all sides dissipated, and the market trend lacked the strength to rise. The opening price was 1,190,000, slightly higher to 1,200,000. Gold firms, securities firms, and others took positions, gradually declining to 1,100,000. In the last fifteen minutes before closing, it became increasingly unsustainable. Under the competition from Guangdong banking groups and others, the market conditions plunged sharply in a straight line, falling all the way into the million mark, reaching a low of 990,000. The closing price barely stood at 993,000, a rebound of 54,000 less than last weekend. Inter-bank clearing transactions were at 1,235,000 in the morning and also retreated to 1,095,000 in the afternoon.

Off-Market

[Report from this newspaper] Off-market trading was active. The morning opening prices were 1,260,000 and 1,270,000, reaching a high of 1,270,000 and 1,223,000. The afternoon opening prices were 1,195,000 and 1,200,500, reaching a high of 1,215,000 and 1,225,000, and a low of 1,175,000 and 1,180,000. The closing prices were 1,185,000 and 1,190,000, also a decline of 85,000. The overnight interest rate was increased by 140,000 per tael, with asking prices reaching 1,325,000 and 1,330,000.

Ornamental Gold

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the price of ornamental gold at silver shops experienced ups and downs. The morning price was listed at 1,220,000 and 1,320,000. In the afternoon, it rose to 1,300,000 and 1,420,000, and finally fell to 1,280,000 and 1,400,000, an increase of 270,000 compared to last weekend. The price of ornamental silver also rose by 2,000, reaching a high of 1,283,000 and 15,000. Money exchange businesses were in a difficult situation. The morning price was listed at 1,250,000 and 1,280,000. At noon, it fell to 1,180,000 and 1,210,000. There were no changes in the afternoon.

US Dollars

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the off-market morning opening prices for US dollars were 25,000 and 26,000, reaching a high of 26,500 and 27,500, and a low of 24,000 and 25,000. The noon closing prices were 24,500 and 27,500. The afternoon trend was relatively stable. The opening prices were 24,500 and 25,500. Midway, due to exceptionally tight positions and limited demand from all sides, it fell to 23,500 and 24,500. The closing prices were 24,000 and 25,000, a decline of 1,000 compared to last weekend. The overnight interest rate was increased by 3,000, with asking prices reaching 27,000 and 28,000.

Silver Dollars

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, there was a lot of arbitrage trading of silver dollars. Changsha used silver dollars for arbitrage, with the price quoted in Gold Yuan Certificates. The exchange rate was 8 yuan higher and 6 yuan lower per hundred yuan. Drafts were Shanghai Zhuang notes, payable one day late upon sight, converted into the local silver dollar price. Telegraphic transfers had a much higher exchange rate than drafts. However, there were also reverse arbitrage transactions, where Shanghai Zhuang and Hakka merchants directly used telegraphic collection. After receiving the money, Shanghai paid the equivalent silver dollar price of the day. In Tianjin and Beijing, the Northern Merchants engaged in fifteen-day forward drafts at the equivalent price. The arbitrage price could be directly passed through without taking an exchange fee, that is, the silver dollar conversion price on the day of the exchange. After fifteen days, the other party paid the equivalent silver dollars. It is said that there was also arbitrage trading of US dollars, but the amount was not large, mostly small remittances to family members, to avoid the conversion losses between People's Banknotes and Gold Yuan Certificates.

Street trading started strong but weakened later. The morning opening price for large heads was quoted at 22,000 and 23,000. In the afternoon, due to the sharp drop in gold prices, holders flocked to sell, gradually declining from 21,000 and 22,000. By evening, the asking price had fallen to 20,000 and 21,000. Small heads were quoted at 15,000 and 16,000, and Dragon Eagle silver dollars were quoted at 11,000 and 12,000. Money exchange businesses engaged in cross-trading of large heads. The initial price for same-day checks was 24,000 and 26,000, but later it also declined to 22,000 and 23,000, a slight increase of 1,000 compared to last week.

### Speculative Funds Seek Outlets, Twists and Turns in the Trend of Chinese Stocks

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the Chinese stock market opened high and closed low, with a tortuous market trend. There was a multi-directional attack on the market, with the trend repeatedly falling and rising. However, due to the strong gains last week, market confidence improved again, and off-market speculative funds continuously flowed back, so new buying was very strong. If there were no threats from gold selling, the rising momentum would still be strong. Yong Yarn opened high at 18 yuan. It was heard that the gold and silver market had relaxed its limits yesterday, and the pressure on the industry would inevitably be strong. Large investors were very sensitive, and the short selling momentum was very strong in the morning, with the price declining to 17 yuan. Later, it was heard that the national treasury disbursed military and administrative expenses, with as much as 30 billion flowing out, and credit conditions eased. The off-market interest rate fell to six jiao, and the off-market interest rate also fell to seven jiao and seven jiao five. New buying surged from both inside and outside the market. Banking groups, securities groups, and large investors such as Zheng Zhongren vigorously bought in, and it rose again to 18 yuan 3 jiao 5 fen. Subsequently, the Central Bank sold a large amount of gold, off-market short sellers were active, and the market trend declined again, falling to 17 yuan 2 jiao. Yarn companies supported the market again, and it rose again to 18 yuan 1 jiao. Near noon, tight credit conditions became apparent, and the bulls were unable to struggle, finally closing at 17 yuan 6 jiao at noon.

Small and medium-sized stocks all opened at high prices, and the noon closing price saw a return to parity. Xinyi and Xinguang once reached the upper limit. Xinhua Department Store, Tongyi, Yonggong, Taiwan Sugar, and others all reached their limits. Qinxing, Fuhua, Feng, and others also uniformly moved upwards. The remaining stocks all rose after opening, and the noon closing price was stable.

In the after-market, credit conditions were extremely tight, and the off-market interest rate was surprisingly high. Gold industry groups certified that securities groups were eagerly seeking orders, and the daily interest rate was shouted up to around two yuan. Floating sales resumed, and the market conditions initially opened softly. Later, due to the easing of credit conditions, short positions from the previous market were covered, and the closing price rose again, finally creating a high price of 19 yuan 1 jiao.

Off-market trading initially traded at 17 yuan 3 jiao, fell to 16 yuan 05 fen, and finally closed at 16 yuan 7 jiao. The remaining stocks all rebounded compared to the previous market, with a turnover of 4.6334 billion shares.

### Prosperous Chinese Yarn, Cloth Prices Rise in a Straight Line

The yarn market opened in the morning. It was heard that gold had reached the upper limit, and credit conditions were easing. Guangdong merchants continued to absorb, and the local market was also optimistic, buying on dips. The front-end merchants took advantage of the momentum to pull up prices, and the holders insisted on not letting go. Various yarns were thriving.

42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 8.5 million yuan, and midway reached the 9 million mark. Near noon, many holders sold to take profits, and the price fell back to 8.75 million yuan, a result of an increase of 850,000 yuan compared to Saturday. 40-count Blue Phoenix surged by 1 million yuan. 32-count Silver Moon opened in the morning at 5.6 million yuan, once tapped 6 million yuan, and then detoured down, finally trading at 5.7 million yuan, an ultimate increase of 450,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse opened at 4.38 million yuan, reaching a high of 4.56 million yuan, and closed at 4.42 million yuan at noon, an increase of 350,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse broke through the barrier, seeing a new high price of 4.34 million yuan, an increase of 460,000 yuan compared to the previous high. Various grades below 16 counts also rose accordingly.

The rising trend of cotton cloth became increasingly crazy. Due to the gradual easing of credit conditions and the sharp increase in off-market goods, market sentiment was volatile, retail investors were scrambling to buy, and holders vigorously pulled up prices, so the price rose in a straight line.

The leading fine cloth opened in the morning and saw a high of 192,000 yuan. Midway, it once tapped the 200,000 mark. Near noon, it was reported that the national bank was selling a large amount of gold, and the general credit conditions were tightening. Sensitive people hurriedly sold, and the price saw a low of 191,000 yuan. Near the closing, short positions were slightly covered and rebounded, finally closing at 196,000 yuan at noon, a surge of 50,000 yuan compared to the weekend.

Four Gentlemen Yuan Central Serge surged by 43,500 yuan from 272,000 yuan to 173,500 yuan. The 190 high-end Shilin factory plate even opened at 432,000. In the after-market, all parties were generally in a wait-and-see attitude, and there were not many transactions, totaling 200,000 for the leading fine cloth and 180,000 for Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge.

### Market Stroll

— A Spectator

The Trend is Terribly Large, All Banks and Businesses are Shaking

Yesterday's market was extremely serious. It is more serious to say that today's market will be even more serious.

The stiff ×Four Banks×, ×Four Banks×, etc., all say they want to stop accepting bank drafts for cash. Last night, almost all had problems. Large and small banks and businesses worked overnight. As of this writing, there are still fifty or sixty that cannot be settled.

This trend can be said to be the first of its kind since the victory. Because the Central Bank vigorously sold off taels at noon, everyone blamed the Central Bank. And the Central Bank, of course, blamed it on the comprehensive surge in various market prices yesterday morning.

Now, it is not a matter of shirking responsibility, but how to get through the gate. Last night, the Central Bank opened the door wide. During the day, the price of gold rose to more than 12 million, and the Central Bank also sold off at a high price of 11 million or 12 million. But late at night, the Central Bank bought back at 9 million, breaking out a position to maintain banks and businesses. This money can be said to have been earned handsomely.

From the perspective of cracking down on speculation, the methods can be said to be ruthless. But who opened up speculative trading in gold and silver? What is called cracking down on speculation? Promoting speculation first and cracking down later, isn't this joking with merchants?

From the perspective of stabilizing the market, it can never be achieved with such a public market policy. Unless a thorough cleanup is done.

There are so many large and small banks and businesses in this city, and the licenses are all issued by the Ministry of Finance. Having reached such a point, the Ministry of Finance cannot but bear full responsibility.

A most serious problem is that some say that so-and-so etc. have stopped accepting bank drafts. What kind of system is this? If bank drafts can be stopped, then the credit of the issuing banks and businesses is ruined. How can they still be allowed to exist?

But the issuing banks and businesses can also spread out their reasons, because they do not have cash positions. Then the responsibility lies with the Central Bank.

In fact, being anxious is superfluous. Look, it's not that "the boat will naturally straighten when it reaches the bridgehead," but that the Central Bank and this group of big bosses are all touching feet to feet. Face-saving is done behind the scenes. Everyone can pass safely, and the unlucky ones are still the manufacturers and the general public who still hold bank drafts.

From today on, all merchants and people in the city should remember that it is really dangerous to take bank drafts today when they are being issued indiscriminately. To be honest, the checks of reputable manufacturers are more credible than those of banks and businesses. Now many people choose bank drafts and do not welcome checks, which is the most easily deceived misconception.

Leaving aside this trend, let's talk further about the impact on the market. The first is that the stock market will collapse. The major bull Zheng Zhongchen is too late to come out. Then the overnight interest rate is as high as more than 3.5 yuan. If you calculate it, it is not that you can pass the 20 yuan mark. But can you withstand it? It's hard to say, really hard to say.

As for the general commodity market, it will also collapse in a daze. However, importantly, it will not affect retail market prices. Small citizens have a share in the rise, but not in the fall.

Counting gold, banknotes, and silver dollars, they were also dragged down very badly last night. But no matter how much it changes, the overall situation needs to be paid attention to.

Commodities May Collapse in a Daze, but Small Citizens Will Not Benefit

### Baseball Season is Coming, Panda Team Begins Intense Training, Establishing a Training Class to Solve the Referee Shortage

[Report from this newspaper] This year's Happy Valley Baseball Open is being actively prepared by the organizer, the International Sports Association, and will begin in the near future. Many teams are participating, and the grand occasion has decreased last year. Various persons in charge and team coordinators in the softball world have been busy running around to prepare various procedures recently. The referee training class established to address the shortage of referee talents has also begun classes.

The defending champion, the strong Panda team, aware of the imminent softball competition, has begun intense training to maintain its past. Every Sunday, they practice for two hours at the Jiaotong University stadium, still under the guidance of "Father Panda" Mr. Liang Fuchu. In terms of lineup, catcher Cao Kejia has gone to Taiwan and may return to Shanghai in the near future. Therefore, the catcher position has been changed to veteran Wang Qingrui. Qingrui has been out of the glove for a long time, and his skills are inevitably rusty, but after several intense training sessions, he has gradually regained his former appearance. The Panda team has also recruited two athletes from Jiaotong University to help out.

On the women's side, the runner-up, the Shengdeng team, which once dominated, has not yet begun its activities. The team's pitcher, Cheng Molan, a Shanghai National Games representative, has a foot injury and may not be able to run on the field again this year. Third baseman Cai Binqiu and one, Gu Yi, have gone to Guangzhou and Hong Kong. Therefore, this year, Shengdeng may merge with the Racoon team of the McTyeire School, selecting the best and competing with the foreign teams.

[Another report] According to the person in charge of the referee training class: The class currently has fifteen new students and has already had six classes. However, in order to create new talents, those who are interested in learning are still welcome to register and join. The registration office is in the US Navy Sports Department of the Happy Valley Racecourse. (You Xin)

### Hong Kong Grass Court Tennis Ends, Xu Brothers Retain Doubles Championship Seven Times, Ye Guanxiong Injured, Hui Tang Cannot Work Miracles Alone

[Hong Kong Aviation News] April 1st was the date for the doubles final of the Grass Court Open Tennis Tournament, which is also the finale of the entire competition. The match was between the Xu brothers, Wei Pei and Run Pei, and Ye Guanxiong and Li Huitang. The number of spectators was the highest of all the matches. After an hour and twenty minutes of fierce fighting, the Xu brothers ultimately won again with a score of three to one due to their deeper tacit understanding, and won the Hong Kong Doubles Championship for the seventh time. Counting from the Xu brothers' initial victory in the Doubles Championship in 1936, they subsequently swept Hong Kong in 1928, 1939, and 1941. From 1943 to 1946, Hong Kong fell and the competition was not held. After the war, in 1947, the competition was reopened, and the three also Doubles Championships all went to them. Their achievements are brilliant and gratifying. As for the Doubles Championship since the Hard Court Open Tournament, it has never fallen into the hands of others. Also, the Mixed Doubles Open Championship after the war has also twice gone to the Xu brothers and the women they paired with, which is not the subject of this article, so I will not elaborate on it.

The slow-to-warm-up Xu brothers still lost their standard in the initial round, especially the elder Xu, making numerous mistakes. In addition, Ye Guanxiong performed extremely well, and Li Huitang also had an excellent performance. As a result, Li led all the way, winning five games straight. Only then did the Xu brothers manage to take back one game. In the seventh game, the Xu brothers lost again. Thus, Ye and Li won a big victory with a score of six to one. Xiongwei was particularly strong, almost controlling the entire game. In the first game, Ye served first and lost only two points before winning. The last point was Li Huitang's successful high-pressure shot. In the second game, Run Pei served, and the game was tied twice, but ultimately Ye won. In the third game, Huitang served, and the game was also tied once, but Ye and Li ultimately won. In the last point, Hui's serve was strong, and Xiao Xu's shot immediately hit the net. The fourth game was also lost by Wei Pei's serve. In the fifth game, Ye sent out an ace ball, suddenly making it impossible for the elder Xu to grasp. In this game, during the fierce battle, Guanxiong accidentally sprained his ankle when jumping high, but he was still able to fight bravely and only lost one point before winning again. After the fifth game, he hurriedly put on rubber ankle support before continuing the game. However, his sprinting was obviously not as good as before, so he lost the sixth game, and then worked hard to win the seventh game and won the first set. This set lasted fifteen minutes. Ye Guanxiong had one "ace" ball. None of the four had double errors. By point count, the Ye and Li group scored a total of 30 points, and the two Xus only got 9 points.

At the beginning of the second set, the Xu brothers' level still had not fully recovered. The elder Xu served first, and although he caught up to a tie three times, he still lost in the end. In the second game, Ye served and won again, losing only one point. At this time, Ye's running was slightly unsteady, and the Xu brothers seized the opportunity to launch an offensive. Because Ye's running was not very convenient, he had to switch to a defensive posture. As a result, they chased back to a 2-2 tie. But in the fifth game, Wei Pei lost again due to a careless ball, and Ye and Li still led by three to two. At this point, they suddenly rose up and won two games in a row, initially leading by four to three. In the eighth game, Ye's divine power was greatly demonstrated, and he used a blitzkrieg method, and advanced back to a four-to-four tie. At this point, the Xu brothers jointly attacked Huitang, forcing Li to play ground balls, which he was not very good at. As a result, they began to gain a net profit in the ninth game. They also only lost one point in the tenth game before winning. Thus, the Xu brothers took back the second set with a score of six to four, becoming a one-to-one situation. This set also had no double errors. Ye had one "ace" ball. It took 23 minutes to complete the game. It is said that Ye was able to lead until the fifth game after injuring his ankle. If Ye had not been injured, the situation might not have been the same. If Li and Ye were able to win the second set again, it is unknown whether the Xu brothers would be able to retain the doubles championship this year. This is not an excessive statement.

In the second set, the Xu brothers first won a net game, and then lost two consecutive games. In the fourth game, Huitang made a double error in a tense situation, and was chased by the Xu brothers to a 2-2 tie. In the elder Xu's serve, both heroes were vying for the ball, and Huitang also performed well. As a result, the Xu brothers fell behind again with a score of two to three. At this point, the Xu brothers realized their level, and with net profits, they broke Kai's serve, and directly won the advantage of leading by five to two. The serve was chased back by Ye and Li to four to five. In the tenth game, although Ye served, it was still impossible to stop the progress of the Xu brothers. Thus, the Xu brothers won again with a score of six to four. This set also lasted 23 minutes. The Xu brothers scored a total of 35 points, and Ye and Li 27 points. The whole set had no ace balls, and Huitang had one double error.

In the fourth set, there were fierce battles in the first two games. After repeated ties, the victory ultimately belonged to the Xu brothers. After this, the elder Xu's level gradually recovered, and he repeatedly used high balls or earth balls to push Huitang back. As a result, he won three games straight, lost the fourth game, and then won three games straight, achieving a 6-1 victory, or a 3-1 ratio, and won the championship again. Although the number of games was far apart, it still took 21 minutes to complete the game. The Xu brothers scored a total of 34 points, and Ye and Li scored 23 points. Counting the entire game, the Xu brothers won 123 points, and Ye and Li took 108 points. After the game, the award ceremony was presided over by the daughter of the Vice-Supervisor of the University of Hong Kong and Commander of the Self-Defense Forces, Miss Lai. Then, there was a vegetable party.

### Class A First Division of the Basketball League, Only Three Games Remaining

### Tonight's Three Games are All in Class A Second Division

The Basketball League will end tonight, and the order of three games, all in Class A Second Division, will still start at 5:30 PM, competing in the gymnasium, and the tickets will remain the same as before. First, 2B Huili vs. Hezhong. Huili has won three games in a row and maintains its undefeated record with the Police Machine, and has the highest voice for winning the championship. Hezhong's strength is relatively mediocre, and it is difficult to expect any achievements, so Huili will definitely be able to play a triumphant song smoothly. The second game is Class A 2C Jianle vs. Pei'er. After Jianle defeated Meiqi, the hope of winning the championship has turned over. If they win today, their record will be equal to that of the American army, and the winner will be judged based on the points gained and lost. Pei'er has two wins and two losses. In terms of strength, they are not weak, but Jianle's morale is high, and they are afraid of being forced to surrender. The last game is Class A 2A Kang Team vs. Storm. The Kang Team's lineup is quite strong, with both Lu Da and Jin Xun. They have lost by one or two points respectively, which is a pity. Storm is composed of South Myanmar students, and although the cooperation is good, it is difficult to resist the fierceness of the Kang Team. The order of the three games is as follows: Huili -- Hezhong (Class A 2B) 5:30 PM Jianle -- Pei'er (Class A 2C) 6:30 PM Kang Team -- Storm (Class A 2A) 7:30 PM

### Notes on Ping Pong

— Written by Wang Xin-jing, Edited by Chen Lin-sheng (6)

The generation of swinging force completely follows the dynamics of hitting the ball. According to the laws of physics, the larger the swing amplitude, the greater the swing speed, and the greater the force generated. If the swing contains acceleration, then the force generated is even greater. Before we hit the ball, we must pull the arm back, which is to increase the swing amplitude. When hitting, the action is agile, which is to seek a large speed. The wrist has a larger swing amplitude and a faster swing than the arm, which is acceleration. If the hand is not pulled back when hitting the ball, or even the racket stops moving as soon as it touches the ball, then the ball hit will inevitably touch the net and die in the net. This is because the swing amplitude is small. If the arm moves forward slowly from the back, then the ball hit will never have the hope of hitting the opponent. This is because the speed is slow. If the wrist swings with the arm without force, then the ball will inevitably be weak. This is because there is no acceleration. Therefore, the "force" of the ball is greatly related to the size of the swing amplitude and the speed of the swing.

Beginners often use excessive muscle strength, causing the moving muscles and antagonistic muscles to be tense at the same time, the joints are stiff, and the swing is difficult to be fluent. Even the strength of the moving muscles is eliminated. There are often times when muscle strength and swinging force are used together, which is often not as powerful as using one force alone. In fact, the swing should be natural, and the muscles should be relaxed. After practicing for a long time, you will naturally understand the benefits of using both forces together.

Simply having strength is useless when playing ping pong. You also need to pay attention to the point of "accuracy." This "directional control," the ability to control the ball, and the direction of the arm swing, the positive and negative of the ping pong racket, the point of force application, the direction of the incoming ball... are all of great importance. After a considerable period of practice, this "accuracy" skill will not be difficult to understand intuitively.

### Sleepwalking and Witchcraft

— Yi Jun

I remember that in March, this column published an article about "sleepwalking." This made me think of a witch-like sleepwalking phenomenon in my hometown.

In the temples of my hometown, many well-known Bodhisattvas are enshrined. Because the names of those Bodhisattvas are too famous, even I, who am not very familiar with my hometown, know a few, such as: Third Lord, Marshal He Da, Stone Spiritual Officer, Second Spiritual Officer, Yuan Changshi, etc. When people encounter danger, they chant their Dharma names. When they get sick, they bring their golden statue to their home, brew a cup of tea, offer it in front of the Bodhisattva, sprinkle some incense ash into the tea, and the patient will get better after drinking it; this is for minor illnesses. What if it is a serious illness? That's not simple. At this time, they either seek famous doctors on the one hand and invite famous Bodhisattvas on the other hand; or, stubbornly refuse doctors and rely entirely on the Bodhisattvas. Usually, each Bodhisattva has a fixed witch, which we call "disciple" in our hometown. These "disciples" are usually ordinary farmers and craftsmen. However, when the Bodhisattva they follow wants to cure people, they suddenly become "spiritual."

There are many ways to cure diseases. Here, I will only talk about the general situation: The so-called "disciple" lies on the bed and sleeps soundly. The Bodhisattva is enshrined in the hall, gongs and drums are played together, incense is burned, and paper is burned to invite the Bodhisattva to descend. Sometimes after making a fuss like this for a night, what is the situation when the Bodhisattva arrives? That is, the "disciple" suddenly jumps up from the dream, shakes violently with the upper body naked, rushes to the hall, and jumps and dances. Then, on the table in front of the god, they point to books and speak. Often, a person who is illiterate at this time can recite elegant verses (unfortunately, I cannot give those verses now). After the poem is completed, the prescription is written. The prescriptions are all strange and unreasonable things, such as: goose dung, a certain kind of soil, are also listed. What is strange is that the patient does not take effect, and there is not much harm. After the prescription is finished, the "disciple" suddenly shouts "My god is leaving," and then falls backward. Everyone helps him up and prostrates him on the table for a while, and then he returns to normal.

When the "disciple" is sleeping, sometimes people can hear him mumbling outside, as if talking to someone. It is said that this is talking to the Bodhisattva!

In addition, there is a rare situation: when the "disciple" has an attack, they can be on a sharp blade.

What is recorded above is what they said in my hometown. Because this trick looks similar to sleepwalking on the surface, so I tentatively record it.

### Coupons and Circles

— Qu Chen

Some people say: the "coupon" in Gold Yuan Coupon cannot bear to be interpreted as "circle." The reason is: the more "coupons" are issued, the more "circles" are added to the price list? On the other hand, the bodies of ordinary people seem to be getting tighter and tighter, circle after circle, by this inexplicable "circle," and they can hardly breathe. However, who can say that this "coupon" is not that "circle"!

### San Yuanweng's Kindness and Forgetfulness

— Chen Yixian

The great American writer Mark Twain was out for a walk one evening when he met a postman. He stopped and asked, "Do you have any letters for me?" The postman said, "Okay, what is your name, sir?" Mark Twain scratched his head and thought for a long time, but he couldn't remember it. He had to say awkwardly: "Let me go home and ask." The postman smiled and left.

Song Jiang's Notes on Bizarre Matters has a record of Wang Wenzheng Gong Dan's forgetfulness: "And there was a horse groom who asked to resign after his term expired. The Duke asked, 'How long have you been leading my horse?' He replied, 'Five years.' The Duke was surprised and said, 'Why don't I remember having you?' He gave him a small gift and sent him away. After he left, he called him back and said, 'Are you so-and-so?' He replied, 'Yes.' Then he gave him another generous gift. The person usually led the horse, and the Duke only saw his back, not his face, so he did not recognize him. When he left and saw his back again, he recognized him as so-and-so."

People forget their own names, and they don't recognize the face of their own horse groom for five years. People must not believe such strange things. The rest of what I know about San Yuanweng's anecdote, his forgetfulness is no less than that of the ancients, and it is quite laughable. I will describe it now.

San Yuanweng originally lived in a house on Shangsi Tiao Lane, Qingxi, Nanjing. During the Wuchang Uprising on October 10th, Zhang Xun fought with the civilian army in Nanjing. San Yuanweng and his family came to Shanghai and lived on Old Baizi Road. In the first year of the Republic of China, he returned to Xishan, Nanchang, Jiangxi to return to his ancestral grave. The Jianglun boat docked, and his servant hired a carriage for San Yuanweng to carry his luggage. When he arrived at Old Baizi Road, a row of foreign houses, all with the same style, San Yuanweng could not enter his door, and he did not remember the house number. The carriage hovered on the road for a long time, and the coachman said, "Can you recognize which house?" San Yuanweng said, "I recognize that foreign house." The mansion of Li Gongguan on Chongqing Road was the residence of Li Jingyi (who served as the Governor-General of Yunnan and Guizhou during the late Qing Dynasty). This place was a lane house, and there was only one large foreign house near Weihaiwei Road, so San Yuanweng could recognize it without error. Li Mugong (named Guosong, Jingyi's son, studied ancient Chinese literature with San Yuanweng) paid for the carriage and hired another carriage to send him home. This kind of forgetfulness of not recognizing one's own residence can probably only be done by San Yuanweng.

### "Neizi" Is Not "Neiren"

— Yi Fei

The Book of Rites: "Zengzi said: Daifu neizi." The note says: "Neizi, wife." Therefore, when people call their wives, they should say "neizi," not "neiren." Nowadays, people call their wives "neiren" to guests, which is a big mistake. According to the "neiren" in the Tang Dynasty, it was a term for prostitutes. Tang Zhang You's poem: "Neiren has sung the Oriole's song, swaying lightly under the willow tree." Cui Lingqin's Records of the Teaching Workshop says: "Prostitutes enter the Yichun Courtyard, which is called neiren." Neiren was an official prostitute in the Tang Dynasty. In large banquets, they were often ordered to sing to accompany the wine, similar to the geishas in Japan today. It is extremely insulting for people today to call their wives by the name of prostitutes.

Prostitutes are also called Biaozhi and Jiaoshu. The prostitute's other name, Biaozhi, was used by the Yuan Dynasty in the sense of "neizi," meaning an outside wife. Jiaoshu was the name for prostitutes called by the people of Shu. Hu Zeng's poem to Xue Tao: "Xue Jiaoshu is by the Wanli Bridge, living behind closed doors under the pipa." In the past, people used prostitutes to manage wine, so they were called jiu zheng, and also called lushi. But I don't know what they recorded.

### Reading April Fool's Day News

— Chun Yi

Although the Cold War between the East and the West has reached a white-hot state, it seems harmless to play small jokes on each other on "April Fool's Day." But judging from the "fake news" fabricated by news reporters on this "April 1st," the technique is really not worth complimenting. Take Shanghai as an example. Although some people will go to the International Hotel to inquire about the news of Zhang Xueliang's release, based on the judgment of a competent news reporter's common sense of words, the possibility of releasing Zhang Xueliang in the current atmosphere of war fog is very small. I say common sense judgment refers to the fact that Zhang will not leave Taiwan for "reading and cultivating his nature" for a while under the current situation.

Furthermore, regarding the second big news of "successful silver loan," when 50,000 to 100,000 large banknotes are about to fly all over the sky, and another financial and economic reform plan is about to be announced and implemented, anyone who is slightly familiar with the situation in the United States regarding China will immediately deny this joke.

Based on the above two "April Fool's news," I have come to the conclusion: the people who made this news are not very skilled in technique. Anyone with a little political common sense and a "news nose" will shrug their shoulders and say: See a ghost!

The third piece of news is: civil servants' salaries will be reissued in silver dollars. The news is very good. More than 3 million civil servants across China will be overjoyed, but according to Article 2, if there is no hope for the "silver loan" one day, this "beautiful dream" will also be shattered immediately. Therefore, this "fabricated" news has no basis.

As for making "good news," there is still something to say; but pointing out that people "commit suicide by poisoning" is not only not worth emulating, but also the intention is very terrible.

In fact, the biggest news of "April Fool's Day" this year is still "peace talks." It was picked on "April 1st" without being early or late. If you savor the meaning carefully, this joke is not too big or too small.

### Family Background Evaluation

—

After reading Ba Jin's novel "Home," people will naturally feel disgusted by the darkness and autocratic tyranny of Chinese feudal families. Now, let's look at the movie "Home" starring Frederick March (which was shown in the Majestic Theater). All the crows in the world are black. American families are just as full of oppression, tyranny, suspicion, and selfishness, and finally force a conscientious housewife—Li Funi—to leave home.

Like "Gone with the Wind," "Home" is set against a story during the American Civil War. Marcus, who made a fortune in business during the North-South War, owns a grocery store in a small village in South America. Marcus loves money like his life and is stingy by nature. He focuses all his attention on money. The eldest son, Peng, is a treacherous and cunning person, but under the control of his stubborn father, he can only do the bookkeeping in the store without any ambition. The second son, Oscar, is stupid and disturbed, and falls in love with a frivolous dancer. Because his father refuses to give him money, his hope of getting married is shattered. The youngest daughter, Li Qina, is a precocious girl who acts spoiled, presumptuous, and lies. She first deceives her father, and when her eldest brother gains power, she immediately turns around and caters to her eldest brother. Marcus' wife, Li Funi, is a conscientious woman. Because her husband hoarded and speculated during the war and made a fortune by plundering, and also led the Northern Army into the country, massacring the villagers, Li witnessed it with her own eyes and felt painful in her conscience. She wanted to start a hospital to atone for her sins, but Marcus refused to give her money. Later, Marcus drove his eldest son out of the house, and Li angrily revealed the secrets of the past ten years. After the eldest son found out, he used this as a threat to force Marcus to write a note, transferring all his property to the eldest son for management at the price of one dollar. After the eldest son took power, Li asked the eldest son for money to build a hospital again, but unexpectedly she was also rejected, which made Li realize that no one in this family had humanity, and she angrily left this home that was not worth staying in.

What is the theme of "Home"? It is to explain that if there is no common belief, no good education, and no harmonious feelings in a family, just having money is not happiness. Marcus' family is not without money. Material enjoyment is not a problem at all. The problem is that everyone feels depressed, lonely, suspicious of each other, and scheming in spirit. The five people in the family have five different hearts. On Li Funi's birthday, everyone fought openly and secretly, and the contradictions reached their peak. In the end, this home was replaced by violence - transferred from Marcus' hand to Peng's hand. The author grasped the climax of this family struggle and used a light and compact writing style to depict this extremely brilliant cross-section of "Home". There are many humorous jokes, many sharp-tongued dialogues, and many thought-provoking maxims. This is a movie script with profound meaning.

If we are allowed to be picky, there is no newborn second generation in this movie script. There is no family traitor who dares to cry, dare to laugh, dare to be angry, dare to scold, and dare to fight. There is only a conscientious housewife - and in the end, she just leaves, which is too weak.

It's not because Frederick March is a Golden Globe Award-winning star that we are praising him randomly. Indeed, in Hollywood Westerns full of thigh pornography, this meaningful "Home" is very good.
