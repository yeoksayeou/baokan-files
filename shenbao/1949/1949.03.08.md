### Today's Legislative Yuan Will Have a Questioning Battle: Deciding the Fate of Sun Ke's Cabinet; The Executive Yuan Held a Talk Session Yesterday, All Advocating Mutual Forbearance for the Sake of the Nation; Policy Report Divided into Two Parts

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 7th] The fate of Sun Ke's cabinet depends on whether it can survive the questioning ordeal at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 8th. At that time, Sun Ke will lead the heads of various ministries and commissions to attend and deliver a policy report. Currently, the Legislative Yuan is filled with strong anti-Sun sentiment, and it is expected that some legislators will launch a major attack on Sun Ke after the policy report. It is anticipated that the questions will be very sharp, and the attitude will be extremely severe. Sun Ke spent the entire day of the 7th talking with various political commissioners. In the morning, he convened a political commissioners' talk session to discuss how to cope with the difficult situation tomorrow. During the meeting, opinions were also exchanged on the issue of whether the cabinet should resign en masse. The political commissioners all advocated humility and tolerance, mutual forbearance for the sake of the nation, and listening attentively. They believed that the current situation is difficult, and it would be best for individuals to resign early, but based on a sense of political responsibility, they should not lightly speak of resigning en masse, let alone plunge government affairs into stagnation during a period of transition. It is estimated that at least two-thirds of the legislators are united in opposing Sun Ke, and the legislators in Nanjing will be the center of the questioning on the 8th. Another group of legislators, considering the difficult times, advocated a slight easing, but they fear that they will be reluctant to speak given the atmosphere at the meeting. Observers say that the questioning of Sun Ke's policy report at the Legislative Yuan meeting, no matter how severe, will not be enough to bring down Sun's cabinet, because if Sun does not resign and retreat, the Legislative Yuan has no power to make a resolution forcing the Premier of the Executive Yuan to resign. Wu Tiecheng, Vice Premier of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 7th to discuss policy guidelines and how to deal with the difficult situation, and attended the political commissioners' talk session that morning. The political commissioners' talk session on the morning of the 7th was personally presided over by Premier Sun, and the political commissioners staying in Nanjing, Zhang Qun, Zhu Jiahua, Xu Kan, Hong Lanyou, Zhong Tianxin, Liu Weizhi, Guan Jiyu, Wu Shangying, Chen Xueping, and others, all attended and participated.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 7th] There were signs of an imminent political crisis within the government on the 7th. A debate on the morning of the 8th will be a memorable page in the brief history of the Legislative Yuan. Anti-Sun legislators will undoubtedly run wild at the meeting. In addition to the scheduled questions, it is heard that legislators will also raise questions about the sudden dismissal of Chen Yi, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, and the appointment of Zhu Shaoliang as the Pacification Commissioner of Fuzhou, Chen Cheng as the Chairman of Taiwan Province, and Fang Tian as the Chairman of Jiangxi Province. As for the scheduled questions, they will focus on: (1) the Executive Yuan's unauthorized move to Guangzhou and the chaotic situation during the move; (2) the Control Yuan's investigation of corruption and dereliction of duty by the heads of some ministries and commissions of the cabinet; and (3) his personal relationship with Lan Ni, and the illegal procedure of ordering the return of government-confiscated enemy property to Lan Ni. At the same time, letters initiated by legislators from Hubei and the Democratic Freedom Club, respectively, requesting Sun Ke's resignation are being circulated for signatures. Legislators are also preparing to propose that the Executive Yuan move back to Nanjing. It is reported that Sun Ke, in order to curry favor with his enemies in the Legislative Yuan, ordered an early halt to any moves of Executive Yuan agencies and personnel to Guangzhou, and stopped building houses in Guangzhou.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 7th] The policy report that Premier Sun Ke of the Executive Yuan will present to the Legislative Yuan on the 8th is divided into two major parts: the first part is the issue of peaceful progress; the second part is the issue of political reform. In the reform of politics, four points are further listed: (1) guaranteeing the freedom of the people, (2) stabilizing finance and economy, (3) reducing the burden on the people, and (4) improving administrative efficiency. The content is similar to what Sun announced when he received reporters.

[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch on the 7th] After returning to Nanjing from Shanghai today, Zhang Shizhao told reporters that formal talks with the CCP should begin as soon as possible, otherwise the achievements made by the Shanghai peace mission in exchanging views with CCP leaders in North China may be lost. According to observers here, the government's delay in deciding on a peace plan has caused impatience, and the optimism about peace seems to be far less than when the Shanghai peace mission returned from North China.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 7th] Several representatives of legislators visited Premier Sun in the afternoon of the 7th, making a final effort to persuade him to resign voluntarily, but Sun Ke told them that he would remain in office. According to reliable sources, Vice Premier Wu Tiecheng decided to submit his resignation after Sun Ke attends the Legislative Yuan's report on policy on the 8th, regardless of what Premier Sun decides. The legislators who visited Premier Sun included Jiang Yiping and Lu Yuwen. Sun Ke discussed military and economic issues with them, explaining the current situation.

### Please Have the Executive Yuan Return to Nanjing to Work; Quickly Stop Conscription and Grain Requisition; The Legislative Yuan Lists It on Today's Yuan Meeting Agenda

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 7th] The third meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held at 9:00 am on the 8th. The report of Premier Sun Ke's policy guidelines has been listed as a reporting item on the agenda. Another reporting item is the postage increase case. The discussion items are still the case proposed by Li Feng and more than 100 others requesting the Executive Yuan to return to Nanjing to work, the Executive Yuan's letter informing the government of the case of moving agencies to Guangzhou to work, and the case proposed by Huang Tong and others requesting the Executive Yuan to stop conscription and grain requisition. It is expected that after Sun Ke attends the report, the committee members will definitely have enthusiastic questioning. Whether there will be time to discuss the proposals on the 8th is still a question.

### Adjust Railway and Postal and Telecommunications Fees; Submit to the Legislative Yuan in Detail

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 7th] The Executive Yuan's proposed method of adjusting freight rates and fees for railways, postal and telecommunications according to the cost index, as well as related implementation methods and trial implementation, and the case requesting the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process, have been listed as reporting items on the agenda of the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 8th. The opinion of the procedure committee is that members of the transportation and financial committees should be appointed to review together and submit a report within one week. The Executive Yuan's letter described the formulation of this method in great detail, saying that after the case was passed by the Executive Yuan, it was first put into trial implementation because the Legislative Yuan was in recess. According to the postal and telecommunications adjustment, it has been implemented since February 21, and the railway since March 1. The postal and telecommunications fees have also been adjusted again on March 1 according to this method.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 7th] The proposal by legislators Li Feng and 103 others, requesting the Premier of the Executive Yuan and the heads of important ministries and commissions and political commissioners to return to Nanjing to work, and that the political affairs meeting should be quickly resumed in Nanjing to benefit government affairs and promote peace, stated: "It is found that this time the Executive Yuan moved to Guangzhou to work, and the hasty move south caused a phenomenon of government affairs stagnation and the disintegration of institutions, resulting in government employees being displaced, government orders unable to be implemented, people being confused, and public opinion being in an uproar. In order to enhance administrative efficiency, stabilize the hearts of the people throughout the country, and strive for the realization of peace, the Premier of the Executive Yuan, the heads of important ministries and commissions, and political commissioners, it is necessary to move back to the capital as soon as possible and hold political affairs meetings in Nanjing regularly. Therefore, the following measures are proposed: The first measure is to ask the Premier of the Executive Yuan, the heads of important ministries and commissions, and political commissioners to move back to Nanjing to preside over government affairs, and the political affairs meetings should be held regularly in Nanjing."

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 7th] The proposal by legislators Huang Tong and 33 others to quickly stop conscription and grain requisition, stated that the reasons are: "Conscription has always been a universal practice in the world, and it is also an important policy for defending the country since the Anti-Japanese War. Grain requisition is to meet military needs, and it seems that both cannot be abolished. However, due to the poor politics of our country, the handling of military service and grain administration is the greatest pain for the people, morale is declining, and the hearts of the people are scattered. This is also a reason. At this point in time, there is no talk of external war, and internally, we have ceased fighting to seek peace, and there is no need to increase military strength or collect military grain. On the contrary, preparing for war will cause suspicion and hinder the progress of peace talks, which is even more unwise. Even if it is said that peace has not yet been achieved and soldiers cannot be without preparation for a day, judging from the current situation, if peace is not achieved, war can be started immediately. When will new soldiers be conscripted, and training will take time, making it difficult to solve the immediate crisis. Conscription is useless, only causing suffering to the people, losing the hearts of the people, hindering the progress of peace talks, and damaging the manpower and financial resources for production, delaying the success of national construction. Why not stop conscription and grain requisition, relieve the suffering of the people, and restore the vitality of the country? If we can immediately take this decisive action of stopping conscription and grain requisition with great benevolence, great wisdom, and great courage, our sincerity will move both at home and abroad, transform the psychology of the people, and universally arouse the faith of the people and gain sincere support. The CCP may also be moved to stop the movement of joining the army and donating grain in various places, similarly reduce troops and demobilize, and jointly seek construction. Both sides will actually lay down their arms, and everyone will sincerely seek peace, and then thoroughly reduce troops and massively return to work, focusing on the great cause of peaceful national construction, which will benefit the country and the people. Can it be understood simply?" The proposal is attached with three measures: (1) The government should first automatically issue a clear order to the whole country to immediately stop conscription and grain requisition, and then talk about reducing troops and demobilizing and engage in production and national construction. (2) The government should show the world with facts and contact the CCP to discuss and request them to completely stop the movement of joining the army and donating grain in various places, similarly reduce troops and demobilize, and jointly seek construction. (3) The government should print and distribute the order and meaning of stopping conscription and the reasons for reducing troops and demobilizing throughout the country, which should be sent by aircraft personnel, regardless of north and south, in order to quickly and widely communicate it and make it known to every household.

### Guangzhou Legislative Yuan Friendship Association; Symposium on the Current Situation

Taiwan Legislative Yuan Representatives Report

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th] According to the Legislative Yuan News Office, the Legislative Yuan Friendship Association held a symposium at 3:00 pm on the 7th. Eighty-five members attended, and Xu Qingquan was publicly elected as chairman. First, Ni Wenya and Bai Yu, the two committee members sent by Taiwan, reported the opinions of the Taiwan Legislative Yuan Friendship Association. Then, each committee member exchanged opinions on various important issues, which generally believed that: (1) Peace is the unanimous demand of the people of the whole country, and it is also the proposal of colleagues in Guangzhou. However, what we expect should be comprehensive and genuine peace, and comprehensive and genuine peace must be based on the principle of equality and be negotiated in a harmonious and free place so that both sides can achieve the peace needed by the people of the whole country in a situation of mutual respect and mutual tolerance. (2) The current situation is difficult and dangerous. A slight carelessness will plunge the country and nation into a state of disintegration. We hope that all responsible people should be calm and composed, face reality, unite sincerely, and work together to help the country and overcome this unprecedented difficulty. (3) Regarding the location of this meeting of the Legislative Yuan, colleagues in various places have different opinions. Therefore, we have always believed that the location of the meeting should be decided by the absolute majority of all colleagues. All proposals are extremely important to the overall situation of this meeting, and we believe that the opinions of the majority of colleagues must be respected so that the resolutions can represent public opinion.

### The Level of Living in Guangzhou is Increasing Daily

[United Press, Guangzhou, 7th] After the Sun Ke cabinet moved north, it left an unwelcome legacy here, which is the increase in the level of living. Before the Sun cabinet moved to Guangzhou at the end of the month, prices were relatively balanced. Hotel room rates were only two-thirds of those in Hong Kong. First-class hotels had no more than US$5 per day for three rooms, but now they require US$10 per day, plus 10% miscellaneous fees. Foreign economic experts believe that the current economic reform plan cannot stabilize the gold yuan.

### The Government Decides to Verify and Reduce Military Spending; This Month, it Will Be Issued According to the Standard of 4.2 Million Troops; It Is Hoped That There Will Be No More Phenomena of Eating Empty Ranks

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The government has made a great determination to implement the verification of military spending in the shortest period. After several consultations on the military spending for March by Xu Kan, Xu Yongchang and others, it has been determined to be issued according to the standard of 4.2 million troops. This figure is limited to March. For the figures from April, the Ministry of Finance hopes to further reduce them, while the Ministry of National Defense argues that they should still be increased. To solve this problem, Premier Sun has decided to complete the verification and issuance of military spending with the greatest determination, hoping that there will be no more phenomena of eating empty ranks in various troops. As for the technical issues of verifying and issuing, he will discuss them with the heads of the Ministry of National Defense and military leaders in various places, and he hopes that every commander will understand the difficulties of the country and help promote it. However, verifying military spending will not reduce the number of troops. The rumors of reducing troops are actually a misunderstanding of verifying military spending. After the military spending is verified and issued, the amount of military spending in the future will definitely be greatly reduced compared to March.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Wu Shangying, Minister of Land Affairs, said: The problem of land reform in our country has not yet embarked on a solution. In order to meet the urgent needs, we plan to take emergency measures for the two items of farmland distribution and urban housing shortage first. The methods are: Regarding farmland, the Ministry of Land Affairs will supervise the competent authorities in various provinces to determine the legal maximum amount of privately owned land based on the type of land and its production capacity. Privately owned land exceeding the legal amount and various types of land that are not allowed to be privately owned under the Land Law will be requisitioned within a time limit according to law and distributed to self-cultivating farmers.荒Regarding reclaimable wasteland, it will also be distributed to farmers, and the government will lend funds to help them reclaim it. Regarding the urban housing shortage, for all houses in the urban area that can be used for residence and industry and commerce, the relationship between landlords and tenants will be improved first, and all exploitation by intermediaries relying on rents will be abolished. As for how to implement it, it is a technical issue, and the Ministry of Land Affairs should formulate specific methods to supervise the competent authorities in various provinces and cities to earnestly follow them, with the aim of achieving practical results in the short term. However, with the current political situation turbulent and the war not yet over, all political measures are facing the greatest difficulties. It is undeniable that we can only work hard according to the decided policies in order to reach a bright road and embark on the road to success together with the people of the whole country.

### Editorial: The Issue of Pricing Units for Public Utilities

The method of increasing and calculating prices for public utilities in Shanghai has been approved and implemented following the government's financial reform plan. Upon examination, all water, electricity, gas, public transportation, telephone, and ferry services are converted into "Utility Units" and charged in Gold Yuan. This unit is linked to the "Customs Gold Unit," abbreviated as UU. Those who like to joke and be sarcastic call it "Yue Yue" ("Jump Jump"), to describe its inevitable upward jump every day. According to the financial reform plan, the Customs Gold Unit is based on 40 US cents. According to the "Utility Unit" regulations, each unit is equal to 0.625 Customs Gold Units, which is equivalent to 25 US cents.

The people of Shanghai are closely related to public utilities, and they believe that using the "Customs Gold Unit" as the calculation standard for pricing will not only lead to price increases and increase the burden on citizens but also cause confusion in the currency system. Therefore, most people expressed opposition. The Municipal Council specifically convened a public utilities subcommittee today to thoroughly investigate the situation, collect data, and prepare to re-study improvement methods with the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and related parties. At the same time, the central authorities also reportedly have doubts about this pricing standard. Looking at the situation, the public utilities pricing method may be reasonably changed under the supervision of public opinion.

Under the circumstance of rising prices, the cost of various public utilities in Shanghai has increased, and their operations are difficult. Price adjustments are needed at any time. This is a common sense matter, and it is not unique to Shanghai. However, public utilities should aim to provide services, not purely to make profits. The fees charged must consider the burden on citizens and cannot be solely based on the utility's profits. If the public utilities are operated by private capital and cannot bear the losses, it is indeed true, then the government should provide subsidies or loans within the possible scope. Moreover, since the automatic adjustment method has been adopted for public utility prices, prices have risen several times a month, and the charging time has been shortened to several days. From the standpoint of maintaining business operations, automatic adjustment is a flexible adjustment, which is already very beneficial to public utilities. The burden imposed on citizens cannot be considered insignificant. There seems to be no need to create a new pricing standard. The recently announced financial reform plan originally aimed to stabilize the value of the Gold Yuan by leveling market prices of gold and silver. Now, public utilities directly managed by the government are changing to calculate fees based on the "Customs Gold Unit" ratio, which is undoubtedly a blow to the Gold Yuan.

The so-called "Customs Gold Unit" is the "Customs Gold Unit" before the war, used exclusively by import merchants to pay customs duties. It is by no means a currency that can be used for general commodity transactions. From the perspective of the currency system, the "Customs Gold Unit" is a virtual gold unit. The government uses it to calculate the collection of customs import duties in order to guarantee that tax revenues do not suffer devaluation losses. It cannot be regarded as a pricing unit for general commodity transactions. This time, Shanghai public utilities adopted the six-point-two-five discount unit of the Customs Gold Unit, which is equivalent to using US dollars as the pricing standard. This is an unprecedented initiative that has not been done even during the concession era. If it is implemented thoroughly, the malpractices will be unimaginable. To put it simply, we can point out the impact of various malpractices: (1) Changing public utility pricing to Customs Gold Units will create a precedent for market trading behavior. Other items such as rent and general prices will inevitably change the pricing base accordingly. During the Anti-Japanese War, the "Customs Gold Unit Notes" were once used as currency, making the currency system invisibly change from legal tender to the "Customs Gold Unit standard." Based on this fact, it is possible that the medium of commodity transactions in the future may invisibly change from Gold Yuan to the Customs Gold Unit standard. (2) Changing public utility pricing to Customs Gold Units is tantamount to changing to US dollar prices in disguise. Once this precedent is set, other businesses may also use Customs Gold Units for pricing, and even any goods or services can be converted into pricing units in US dollars or Customs Gold Units, thereby completely obliterating the circulation value of the Gold Yuan. (3) The Central Bank purchases US dollars based on the market price of gold and foreign exchange and posts the exchange rate daily. The Customs Gold Unit changes with the price of the US dollar, even changing daily. Therefore, public utility prices must also be adjusted daily. Therefore, the UU was Gold Yuan 812.50 last Friday, Gold Yuan 875 last Saturday, and jumped to 987 today, the 8th, an increase of 20% in just three days. According to the past situation in Shanghai, rising public utility prices will inevitably affect the general rise in prices. If public utility pricing truly refers to Customs Gold Units as the unit, the Customs Gold Unit will change daily in the future, which will show that general prices will change several times a day, and will actually lead prices to soar in a straight line. (4) Currently, the general commercial market habits and the salary income of workers and public educators are all based on the Gold Yuan, and the cost of living index is used as an indicator of the value increase or decrease of the Gold Yuan. If this indicator is not replaced by comparing it to the Customs Gold Unit, its impact will inevitably put the people's livelihood and the future of the Gold Yuan in a desperate situation.

In summary, it can be seen that there are many problems with the pricing unit for public utilities. It is appropriate to carefully study and redetermine it. If the Customs Gold Unit is used directly as the standard, in addition to facilitating the profit income of public utilities themselves, the impact on the country and society will have significant drawbacks. However, public utilities are indispensable to the people, so how to enable them to maintain themselves requires careful thought and practical planning. Shanghai people's organizations and the Municipal Council hope that the Municipal Government will withdraw the approved order and advocate for another reasonable method, which is very correct. We firmly believe that Mayor Wu and Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau will be able to learn from others' strengths and seek another appropriate remedial measure.

### Military Situation on the Riverfront Becomes Increasingly Tense; Communist Forces Continue to Approach the National Army's Bridgehead; Confirmation That Xu Shiyou's Troops Have Been Transferred to Northern Jiangsu

[Reuters, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] The Communist forces north of the Yangtze River continue to move south, approaching the National Army's bridgehead on the north bank of the Yangtze River. The situation in the ports of Kou'an and Sanjiangying is unclear. A phone call from Zhenjiang also said that Sanlangmiao, about one mile south of Yizheng, was also attacked by Communist forces last night. The situation in Guazhou remains tight, and the port has been closed.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 7th Dispatch] The local evening paper today carried a report stating: "There are reports of fighting in Sanjiangying on the north bank of the Yangtze River, and the situation is unclear." However, as of 10:00 PM today, the military authorities here have not received any reports from friendly forces stationed in the area. In addition, the First Pacification Area Command in Changzhou has not received any reports on this matter, and it was impossible to confirm it as of the time this dispatch was sent.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 7th Dispatch] The Huaihai Independent Brigade and the Xinghua Independent Regiment of the Communist forces were originally transferred to Dongtai for reorganization and training, but now they have turned back halfway and reopened to the front of the Sanwen River National Army position. The Huaihe Brigade and the Jiangdu Independent Regiment, which originally replaced the task force of the Communist forces, have retreated to the western and southern suburbs of Yangzhou City, respectively. In addition, the situation in Shijiaqiao remains the same. There were no battles yesterday or today. There were small contacts in front of the Wax Temple north of Yihui City yesterday and today.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 7th Dispatch] Regarding the rumor that Xu Shiyou's troops of the Communist forces have been transferred to northern Jiangsu, the military here no longer dismisses it as unfounded and has begun to collect information to verify it. According to reports, Xu's troops command the Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth, and Liangguang Columns, a total of five columns. Currently, it has been confirmed that the Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth Columns have moved south (their positions are shown in the special dispatch from Zhenjiang in this newspaper on the 5th). It has been confirmed that the Liangguang Columns have been transferred to the Lianghuai area, while the position of the Ninth Column has not yet been determined. Military personnel believe that it may be the troops discovered by the Air Force on the Tongyu Line. Since Xu Shiyou was the former commander of the Ninth Column, if Xu comes to northern Jiangsu, his troops are also very likely to be transferred here.

[Our Newspaper, Changshu, 7th Dispatch] Gu Xijiu, Deputy Commander of the First Pacification Area, has returned to his post after completing his official duties in Nanjing and went to Gangkou on the 7th to inspect the defense.

Nationalists and Communists Both Reorganizing Armies

[United Press, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] The Nationalists and Communists are currently reinforcing and reorganizing their armies to prepare for the possibility of resuming large-scale combat if future peace talks fail. The former Nationalist army divisions in North China are now slowly being absorbed into the Communist military structure. Fu Zuoyi's Beiping garrison is being screened, with most officers and soldiers joining General Lin Biao's command. The Ministry of National Defense is planning to recruit new soldiers in various provinces, and Tang Enbo, Commander of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison, is expanding his forces to deploy along the Yangtze River line from Shanghai to Jiujiang. Bai Chongxi's troops are stationed west of Jiujiang, through Hankou to Yichang. Part of Hu Zongnan's army is slowly withdrawing from southern Shaanxi. Military observers with good access to information believe that the Nationalist government's military future is not optimistic, with inferior troop strength, materials, and morale. The Nationalist army commanders are studying two broad defense strategies: one led by Acting President Li, advocating holding the Yangtze River line, and the other believing that the defense line should be south of the Yangtze River basin. The Nationalist army's lack of economic power in South China, local opposition, and the growing shortage of materials are all insurmountable problems. It is heard that the Nationalist army will not engage the main force of the Communist army at any point along the Yangtze River. The Communist army's offensive force is currently included in four major commands: General Chen Yi's command, mostly near Huaiyin, with about 250,000 troops under his command, distributed in the area west of the Jinpu Railway and east of the Grand Canal, facing Tang Enbo's troops. General Chen Geng's command, with about 180,000 troops, has gathered north of the Dabie Mountains and east of the Pinghan Railway. These troops were originally Liu Bocheng's old troops. Peng Dehuai's 120,000 troops are holding the southern Shaanxi position and are currently attacking Hu Zongnan's troops. General Lin Biao's Northeast Army is the main force of the Communist side. Lin is using six columns to guard the north, and more than 200,000 troops north of Yexian can move south. It is heard that two of these columns, supported by artillery, have followed the Pinghan Railway to Yancheng, north of Hankou.

CCP in North China Replenishes Troops

[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 7th Broadcast: According to broadcasts from CCP radio, the CCP in North China is actively seeking to replenish its troop strength in order to continue the southward extension of the Communist forces. Although the Communist Party has expressed its willingness to begin peace talks with the Nanjing government, from another perspective, the CCP is stepping up military preparations everywhere and mobilizing the people to "join the army." According to CCP sources in Beiping, "The People's Soldiers of the Northeast are currently being reorganized and trained in the Pingjin area," and the people of the Northeast, as well as the party, government, military organs, and organizations of the Northeast, are being mobilized to send a large number of condolence items and letters to encourage these new soldiers to "further develop their heroic and tenacious combat spirit, conduct revolutionary competitions with brother troops in Guannei, and liberate the entire China." It is learned that after the Northeast Communist Army commanded by Lin Biao entered Guannei, it is currently opening up the front line in the south. The CCP has been distributing shirts, soap, towels, and cigarettes to every commander and fighter of the Northeast Combat Army in the past few days, hoping that they will "strive to be good soldiers under Chairman Mao, persist in the revolution to the end, and liberate the entire China."

### The Situation in Western Hunan Worsens: Yuanling Peace Talks Break Down; Half of the City Reduced to Ashes; Chenxi City and Arsenal Fall

[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 7th Dispatch] During the Chen Lu peace talks, Liu Jijing, the speaker of the Yuan County Council, crossed the river at the request of the rebels and conveyed his opinion to Wang Jinxiu, the deputy commander of the security forces, requesting that the government forces withdraw from the south bank and retreat to Songxipu, and then negotiate. Wang insisted that the rebels must first withdraw from the urban area. The distance between the two sides was too far, and the talks were declared broken. Starting at midnight on the 6th, a big fire broke out in the city. By the morning of the 7th, half of the city had been reduced to ashes. Chenxi County and the arsenal fell on the 6th. At the beginning of the defense war, Chenxi had 2,000 civilian guns and requested that the government distribute the arsenal's weapons and ammunition to assist the government in combat. The government initially refused, but then approved the request. Unexpectedly, after the weapons and ammunition were distributed, the civilian guns did not fire a single bullet at the rebels but joined forces with the rebels. Currently, Baohe Township and other places in Chenxi have reported rebellion. The situation in western Hunan has reached a point where it is almost impossible to control. According to reports, the leaders of the rebels in various places in western Hunan are all local wealthy people who were disappointed in seeking official positions from the government in the past. Their purpose is to seek personal advancement, and there is no other political purpose and no unified organizational system.

[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 7th Dispatch] People from western Hunan who are living in the province recently exchanged opinions on resolving the western Hunan incident. They all believe that the rebellious areas have expanded and the situation is serious.

### Take a Look at Today's Northeast: People's Lives are Extremely Difficult; Communist Cadres are Corrupt and Engage in Internal Strife; Many Captured National Army Generals are Imprisoned in Harbin

Remarks by Yang Hongguang, Deputy Commander of the Sixth Army Corps, and Others After Escaping to Qingdao

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 6th] Lieutenant General Yang Hongguang, Deputy Commander of the Sixth Army Corps, and Major General Huang Zhihe, special inspector of the war zone appointed by the President, who were captured in the Jinzhou Campaign, escaped from Harbin and arrived in Qingdao on the 3rd. Deputy Commander Yang told the Central News Agency reporter that after being captured, they were sent to a concentration camp in Harbin, where they were imprisoned for more than three months. Because of his serious illness, the Communist army allowed him to return. Senior generals currently imprisoned in Harbin include Zhou Fucheng, Liao Yaoxiang, Li Xianzhu, Fan Hanjie, Lu Junquan, Sheng Jiaxing, Zheng Tingji, Li Tao, Shang Fengwu, Zheng Dongguo, etc. Except for Zheng Dongguo, who is treated specially and imprisoned separately, the rest meet every morning and evening, especially the generals captured in western Liaoning who are subjected to abuse. He also said that inflation in the Communist area is also very serious, with prices jumping more than double every month. Taking the price of gold as an example, when they arrived in Harbin, each tael cost 4 million Northeast Chipi. When they left, it had risen to 12 million yuan. On their way from the Northeast to Qingdao via Pingjin, there were many beggars, and the people's lives were extremely difficult. The people of the Northeast not only have no meat to eat but also lack cooking oil, because soybeans are all transported to the Soviet Union by the Communist Party! Currently, the Communist Party is concentrating all technical personnel in Shenyang for training and has established an air force school there. During the liberation of Shenyang, there was a conflict between the military and the government, with internal factions engaging in open and secret struggles. Corruption among cadres is also widespread due to the universal development of liberated cities, and they all strive to enjoy life. This is a powerful explanation of what is so-called progressive political party. Yang and his party will rest briefly in Qingdao and then fly to Nanjing in a few days.

### Madame Li, Acting President, Issues "March 8th Reflections"

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Madame Guo Dejie, wife of Acting President Li Zongren, recently issued an article entitled "March 8th Reflections." The full text is as follows:

The annual International Women's Day has arrived again. On this festive occasion, in addition to welcoming this festival with joy and excitement, we cannot help but feel sorrow and fear in the face of international disputes and domestic wars. Although the opposing barriers between countries have not yet been eliminated, the worldwide call for peace from people around the world has converged into an irresistible torrent. We believe that this effort will eventually gradually eliminate those factors of suspicion and conflict and lay the foundation for world peace. Secondly, our country has endured eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, followed by three years of civil strife. The nation's lifeline and people's livelihood are hanging by a thread. Although there are different opinions on the rights and wrongs and merits and demerits of this situation, the fact that brothers are fighting each other, leading to the destruction of families and the loss of lives, ultimately harms the common people. Just think about the Huai and Si regions, the Northeast Plain, where blood flowed for thousands of miles, people scrambling for food, young people fleeing, the old and weak filling ditches, and countless orphans, widows, amputees, and cripples. Who would not be saddened by this tragic picture? Recognizing the years of civil war, the suffering of the people, and the general trend of the world's common demand for peace, the government has shown the greatest tolerance and determination to end the war and seek peace, strive for political reform, and remove obstacles to peace. For example, releasing political prisoners, opening up freedom of speech, restoring the activities of democratic political groups, and canceling martial law are all peaceful measures that benefit the country and the people, fully demonstrating the sincerity of seeking peace. This sincerity is directly aimed at reorganizing the devastated homeland, relieving the suffering of the people, and restoring the vitality of the country. Indirectly, it is also aimed at laying the foundation for peace in East Asia and preventing mankind from suffering the threat of war again.

Due to physiological reasons and the constraints of thousands of years of feudal patriarchal society, most of our female compatriots have always been regarded as slaves and commodities. Although many educated women have achieved higher status, employed women are still discriminated against in society. In terms of managing household affairs and dedicating themselves to social work, women can be said to have shouldered a double responsibility, which is something to be proud of. We have the right to appeal to society to give us more fair sympathy and support. Similarly, if we women want to fight for equality in education, economy, and social status, we must also stick to our posts and take it as our responsibility to build healthy families and strive for social welfare, using actions and facts to prove that we women can still be competent and happy in assuming both family and social responsibilities, explaining that everything about women is not inferior to men. I believe that what lies before us is, on the one hand, to use reason to overcome our own difficulties and weaknesses to resist all thoughts, systems, and facilities in society that despise women, and on the other hand, we must recognize the disasters brought about by the civil war, making women feel the pain more deeply than men, so our desire for peace is even more urgent. I think that as long as our female compatriots across the country, regardless of party affiliation, social groups, or political relations, share the difficulties and deeply experience the cruel shackles imposed on women by the destruction of war, we can use our wisdom and abilities, and the gentle, loving, virtuous, and kind nature of women, to persuade their husbands and admonish their sons to work together for peace. Surely, we can turn misfortune into good fortune, shorten the distance to peace, and make the fruits of peace more abundant. Peace is indivisible. We demand lasting and comprehensive peace. I hope that all female compatriots across the country will do their best to promote the peace movement, and I hope that the international women's community will give us more sympathy and assistance, and carry out various social relief work such as peace, disaster relief, and care for orphans and the elderly, and support for the young and the weak, so that peace in China can be realized at an early date, the order in the Far East can be stabilized, and the world's human beings will also be blessed by it.

### In Response to New Soviet Diplomatic Moves, Western Countries Confer on Countermeasures; Draft of the Atlantic Pact Largely Completed; Britain, America, and France to Meet to Determine Common Policy Toward West Germany

[Reported by this Newspaper] Washington, 7th (Broadcast): Following the sudden replacement of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov by Vyshinsky, Western countries, fearing new Soviet actions, have intensified their precautions. Consequently, negotiations on the North Atlantic Treaty have been accelerated. Secretary of State Acheson specially convened a meeting of the ambassadors of the other seven countries participating in the negotiations at 3:00 PM today, apparently to exchange views on Moscow's decision. The draft treaty is largely completed, and the various military cooperation plans mentioned in the treaty will clearly become a new "bet" in the East-West conflict.

[United Press, Washington, 7th] The draft of the North Atlantic Treaty is nearing completion. US Secretary of State Acheson will meet again with the ambassadors of the five Western European countries and Canada today and tomorrow to discuss details and make final decisions. The foreign ministers of each country will then come here in person to sign the treaty before the end of the month. Diplomatic authorities believe that the full text of the treaty can be made public within this week. In addition, Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen will arrive here on the 9th to seek a basis for participating in treaty negotiations.

[United Press, Washington, 6th] The United States, Britain, and France will soon hold an important meeting here to discuss the West German issue. According to official announcements from the capitals of the three countries, the meeting is approaching and the agenda includes the following items: (1) The powers that occupying countries should retain after the formal establishment of the West German government; (2) The common attitude that Western countries should adopt toward the Soviet Union on the German issue; (3) Ways to strengthen the connection between West Germany and Western European political and economic institutions. The most important thing is how to consolidate Western unity to deal with the Soviet Union's future spring offensive. It is widely believed that the Soviet Union will take important actions within two or three months. Diplomatic circles are still trying to find out the reason why Vyshinsky succeeded Molotov as Soviet Foreign Minister, hoping to clearly understand the future development of Soviet diplomacy this week. For Western countries, this week is one of the busiest weeks in the Cold War. Keenan, the highest policy advisor to the US State Department, will go to Germany to conduct an on-site investigation of the US military occupation work and then report to Secretary of State Acheson for reference at the three-country meeting. Mr. Keenan is scheduled to stay in Germany for two or three weeks, so the three-country meeting will likely be held at the end of the month. At the same time, Mr. Heath, the political advisor to General Clay, commander of the US military in Germany, will return to the country within the week to preside over the newly established German Affairs Department of the State Department.

### British Government Decides to Convene Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference Early; To Discuss Communist Offensive in Asia

[Reported by this Newspaper] London, 7th (Broadcast): British officials said that due to the increasingly acute situation in the Far East, the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference will be convened as soon as possible, while the Commonwealth Foreign Ministers' Conference originally scheduled to be held in Colombo in May is planned to be temporarily shelved. The last Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference was held in London last October. British officials said that the conference will undoubtedly discuss the Communist offensive in Asia. The situation has become even more urgent after the Burmese government rejected the mediation of the various Commonwealth countries. Observers believe that if the Burmese government reconciles with the Karen people through its own efforts, the consequences may not reduce the threat of the Communist Party. The recent situation in Malaya will also be one of the topics discussed at the future meeting.

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 6th] Nehru denied at a press conference today that he intended to interfere in Burma's internal affairs and had no intention of promoting a South Pacific Pact similar to the North Atlantic Treaty.

### Southeast Asia Faces Crisis

Concrete Measures to Counter International Communist Threat are Under Discussion

[Reuters, London, 7th] The meeting held in New Delhi last week by representatives from Britain, Australia, New Zealand, India, Ceylon, and Pakistan, seemingly unrelated to the Atlantic Pact, may actually be discussing matters that are part of the Atlantic alliance mechanism. The immediate goal of the meeting is to discuss the rapidly deteriorating economic situation in Burma and its repercussions on neighboring Southeast Asian countries, but just as the real problem of the Atlantic alliance lies in stabilizing the situation in the non-Communist regions to prevent the threat from Moscow and international Communism. The success of the Communist Party in China and the complete failure of American aid to the Chinese Nationalist government have put Southeast Asia in immediate danger of Communist invasion, and it is necessary to seek a group of resistance measures. The fact that this meeting was first initiated by India makes people believe that this resistance method is indeed under discussion. Although there is still a considerable distance from economic meetings to the connection of the entire Southeast Asian region, even if we only consider the situation in Malaya, Burma, and Siam, it is enough to make the non-Communist powers have to deal with the problems currently facing Southeast Asia urgently.

### Britain Decides to Arm Siam to Prevent Communist Threat; Siamese Claim Chinese Communists are Lurking in the Country

[Reported by this Newspaper] London, 7th (Broadcast): Siamese officials said that the British government has assured Siam today that it will provide material assistance to resist the threat of the Communist Party. Siamese officials strongly stated that there are Chinese Communist elements lurking in the country, and it is very possible to take joint action with the Communist Party in mainland China. British officials said that among the Communist elements in Siam, there are quite a few who hold important positions. Although Marshal Phibunsongkhram can currently control his 20,000 army, former Prime Minister Pridi Phanomyong is actually a left-leaning person and has the strong support of the navy. Phibunsongkhram is currently stepping up efforts to equip the army with British weapons and is rushing to build an air force. Air force personnel have all been trained in Britain, and the aircraft they fly are also British-made.

### MacArthur's Advisor Issues Stern Warning: Japan Must Quickly Seek Economic Self-Reliance; Otherwise, America Will Cancel Aid to Japan

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 7th] American banker Dodge, who arrived in Japan on January 5th this year to serve as MacArthur's financial advisor, held a press conference this morning and issued a stern warning to the Japanese government, stating that Japan must balance its budget and increase import and export trade, otherwise, the United States will cancel its aid to Japan. Dodge predicted that if Japan insists on relying on government subsidies to revive its economy, it will head towards bankruptcy.

He hoped that import controls (most of which were initiated by the United States) would be sufficient to prevent 25% of the goods designated by the United States for export from entering the Japanese domestic market. He concluded by strongly advocating that Japan must implement strict plans to reduce the risk of unemployment. He also hinted that the United States plans to gradually reduce rather than gradually increase its financial assistance to Japan. The assistance has reached 1.25 billion US dollars from the start of the war until March 1949.

### Japan Panics After Dodge's Statement; Prime Minister Yoshida is Depressed

However, the spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Finance revealed his disappointment and doubts about this statement. Japanese Minister of Finance Hayato Ikeda even hinted that he would resign after the budget is passed by the parliament because he cannot bear this blame.

### City Council to Hold Special Group Meeting Today to Discuss Public Utility Prices, Oppose Calculation in Customs Gold Units, Seek Other Reasonable Adjustment Methods, Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau Firmly Resigns

[This newspaper] The Public Utilities Subcommittee of the City Council is scheduled to hold a special meeting at 3:00 p.m. today at the Council's office on Tanggu Road to express its opposition to the pricing of public utilities in customs gold units and to discuss reasonable adjustment methods. Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau will be invited to attend and explain the situation.

[This newspaper] Regarding the news reported yesterday that the Ministry of Finance telegraphed Shanghai, hoping to stop the pricing of public utilities in customs gold units in order to avoid stimulating prices, this reporter visited Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, yesterday and asked what measures would be taken. Director Zhao said: The municipal government has not yet received any orders from the Ministry of Finance, and the above news has only been seen in the newspapers, so it is not yet known. As for the decision to price public utilities in customs gold units, it is also a measure taken out of desperation.

It is also learned that today (the 8th), the pricing unit of each public utility is equivalent to 987.5 gold yuan, which is more than 900 times the base number of "August 19," while in fact the increase in the price of coal and fuel oil has exceeded this number. According to the price of coal on "August 19" was 26 yuan per ton, and the current price has reached 158,000 yuan. The base price of oil on "August 19" was 0.35 yuan per gallon, and the current price is 2,008 yuan, so the difficulties of various companies are indeed real. It is reported that the French Electric Power Company yesterday reported an emergency to the municipal government, because the company has always maintained a 70-day supply of oil in the past, but now due to economic constraints, it only has a 9-day supply. In addition, the loans that the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company previously borrowed from the Central Bank have expired, but because it is unable to repay them, it requested a transfer of the term yesterday. Although the new method of adjusting public utilities has been implemented, the number of citizens who pay is not large, so the economic difficulties of various companies have not been alleviated for the time being.

It is also reliably learned that Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, has submitted his resignation to Mayor Wu. After the resignation was received by the municipal government, the mayor originally intended to approve it with the words "retain," but Director Zhao firmly refused, so it was temporarily shelved. It is said that Director Zhao's resignation is very firm.

### Industrial and Commercial Groups Oppose Pricing in Customs Gold Units

The City Industrial Association specially convened discussions among various industries yesterday and decided to send telegrams to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the municipal government, the Public Utilities Bureau, and the City Council to request an explanation of whether it is legal to abandon the pricing of public utilities in national currency and to request prompt correction and prevention in order to maintain industry and benefit people's livelihood. In addition, the Shanghai Nanjing Road Business Association also issued a statement yesterday opposing the pricing of public utilities in customs gold units.

### British EMI Company Dismisses Workers, Causing Disputes

### Zhang Ziping Sued as a Traitor, Retrial Still Upholds the Original Judgment, Living in Poverty and Family Discord, Double Stimulation, Infinite Pain, Female Relatives Attending the Court to Hear the Judgment Talk About Zhang's Recent Situation

[This newspaper] Zhang Ziping, a writer who became famous for writing triangular love novels, was sued for treason. After being sent back to the High Court for retrial, the judgment was pronounced at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, sentencing him to one year and three months of imprisonment, depriving him of public rights for two years, and confiscating his property except for the necessary living expenses for his family. Zhang did not attend the court yesterday. A female relative of his attended the court to hear the judgment. After leaving the court, the female relative talked to reporters about Zhang's recent situation, but she was unwilling to reveal her relationship with Zhang. She said that Zhang's current life is extremely difficult and poor. Due to the impact of this case, he has not published any works for a long time and only relies on submitting articles to a small newspaper in the city for a living. In addition, he translates some textile articles for the Damao Textile Company to help subsidize his living expenses. Due to the meager income, it has affected the harmony between families, and there are quarrels day and night, with almost no peace. His wife and daughters especially showed disapproval of Zhang from time to time, and it can be imagined from the fact that he was not allowed to use the phone at home. In addition to being punished, Zhang was also coldly treated by his wife and daughters, and the double stimulation caused Zhang infinite pain. Zhang originally hoped that the judgment yesterday would declare him not guilty so that he could resume his writing career, but the result was still to uphold the original judgment, which was unexpected. The female relative said: Zhang may consider appealing to the Supreme Court again. Drawing by Lu Shaofei

### The City Industrial Association Calls for Three Points Regarding the New Financial and Economic Reform Plan, Plans to Request the Cancellation of the Collection of Goods Tax in Kind, etc.

[This newspaper] The City Industrial Association recently telegraphed the Executive Yuan, etc., planning to request the cancellation of the method of collecting goods tax in kind and to maintain the method of foreign exchange transfer certificates. Imports are divided into prohibited imports, temporarily suspended imports, and increased limited imports. The original telegram roughly stated:

The announcement of the financial and economic reform plan on February 25 caused all production enterprises to frown and lose color. The most serious relations are the collection of goods tax in kind, the cancellation of the foreign exchange transfer certificate chain, and the freedom of import. The cotton spinning, wool spinning, cigarette, cement, and match industries are all subject to factory tax collection, and the burden is heavy. Sales have already decreased significantly, and with high interest rates and huge expenses, it is already difficult to continue. Now, while stopping the collection of land tax in kind, we are collecting goods tax in kind from factories. Is this not persecuting industrial production? Furthermore, the total exports in 1938 were only US$240 million. In addition to the income from overseas Chinese remittances, the amount is also limited, while the foreign exchange required for equipment and raw materials is huge, and most of the quotas for the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth quarters have not yet been settled. Now, if we suddenly open up free imports, the foreign exchange transfer certificates will be profitable, and speculators and national banks will absorb them in large quantities. With only a small amount of foreign exchange transfer certificates, they will become rare commodities that can be hoarded, and the prices will rise. Our industry needs equipment and raw materials, so we must buy foreign exchange transfer certificates at high prices, which increases the burden. Therefore, our industry is the victim again, so we must request that the chain system be maintained. Furthermore, the fragility of our country's industry is undeniable. Although various industries have laid a foundation, if they are protected and supported, they may not be able to flourish. If they encounter a storm again, they can be destroyed without anything left. The financial and economic reform plan only stipulates the import of permitted and prohibited goods, and there are no restrictions on those that can be produced domestically but whose output is insufficient, such as industrial raw materials such as acids and alkalis and electrical equipment such as motors. In recent years, there has been great progress, but with the rise in wages and raw materials, the cost has not been reduced and cannot compete with foreign goods. Recently, due to war obstacles, various manufactured products cannot be sold smoothly, and inventory is high and turnover is difficult. All of these have been overwhelming. If such goods are freely imported without any restrictions, then the situation in the thirty-fourth and fifth years when foreign goods poured in like a tsunami will be repeated, which is equivalent to immediately suffocating the dying industry. In view of the above, matters related to the national foundation and people's livelihood must be urgently appealed, and attention should be paid to supplementing the implementation regulations of the new plan as soon as possible. The opinions are presented as follows: (1) Cancel the collection of goods tax in kind. (2) Maintain the foreign exchange transfer certificate chain system. (3) Luxurious goods and those that are already fully produced domestically should be completely listed as prohibited imports. Those that are produced domestically but are temporarily insufficient should be listed as temporarily suspended imports, and please increase the number of limited imports, and revise them at any time according to domestic production and needs. If it is considered unnecessary, add tariffs. The above three points are related to the continuation of domestic production, and it is reasonable to request an assessment and prompt adoption.

[Also reported] The National Cement Federation also telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday, making a painful appeal on the issue of the collection of goods tax, believing that it must not be implemented and hoping to maintain the original tax collection method. In addition, they also telegraphed various authorities, requesting that cement be included in the list of prohibited imported goods in order to maintain domestic production.

### The Central Trust Bureau's Deputy Sells Assets of the Enemy Assets Committee; Trial Opens in Case of Employee Embezzling and Selling Ginseng; Bureau Asks for Inclusion of Luo Zhiqin of Yongda Ginseng Shop as a Witness; Ling Fengsheng and Others Deny Involvement, Request Bail Denied

[Our Report] Ling Fengsheng, an employee of the Central Trust Bureau acting on behalf of the Enemy Assets Committee and head of the warehouse, along with Yang Zhaoxiang, a manager, Zhang Minyuan, an employee, and Li Yongqing, a worker, colluded with broker Zheng Heqing to substitute inferior red ginseng for high-quality Korean ginseng. Judge Meng Tingke of the District Court opened the initial trial yesterday afternoon. Hao Zhaomi, representing the Central Trust Bureau, appeared in court as a witness, retaining lawyer Shen Yushan for civil proceedings, and requested that Luo Zhiqin, the person in charge of Yongda Ginseng Shop who purchased the stolen goods, be listed as a defendant. According to the plaintiff's side, the defendants stole a total of 391 boxes of Korean ginseng from the warehouse, each containing 28 branches, valued at one tael of gold per box. After the incident, 380 boxes were recovered, but each box was missing two or three branches, totaling 53 missing branches. The family of Ling offered to compensate for the remaining 11 unrecovered boxes, but after expert inspection, the ginseng was deemed of very poor quality, worth only one-third of the original ginseng, and requested compensation. After the incident, the police investigation revealed that the defendants and their accomplices at large had discussed the plan in room 307 of the Guandong Asia Hotel. The plan was to replace the stored ginseng, with a total value of 300 taels of gold, with inferior ginseng estimated at 50 taels, and after deducting a 10 tael commission, they could net 240 taels. Defendant Ling Fengsheng stated that he was in charge of the warehouse, but the office was located in the Central Trust Bureau on Guangdong Road, and all warehouse matters were entrusted to Yang Zhaoxiang and Zhang Minyuan. The warehouse keys were held by Yang and Zhang during the day and handed over to him after work. He did not know who transported the ginseng out. Regarding the meeting in the Guandong Asia Hotel room to discuss the ginseng swapping plan, he claimed to have strongly opposed it. When questioned, defendants Yang and Zhang stated that Ling was responsible for holding the warehouse keys. Although they went to Guandong Asia Hotel that day, they saw Ling already there and rejected the ginseng swapping method before leaving. The other two defendants also denied any involvement. After repeated questioning by the court, the judge ordered a special trial to be scheduled at a later date, and the defendants' request for bail was denied.

### Youth Army 202nd Division Requests Thorough Investigation of Forced Purchase Incident

Wang Dajun, commander of the Youth Army 202nd Division of the Army, stated: "I recently read a news item in your newspaper on March 3 of this year, strictly prohibiting soldiers from forced purchases, which mentioned that the Shanghai Municipal Council had received complaints from twelve coal shops that soldiers claiming to be from the 202nd Division of the Youth Army stationed in this city were forcing them to purchase fuel. I was very surprised after reading this. After investigating, this incident occurred before January 10 of this year. In fact, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters ordered our division to investigate. Since our division was stationed in the Suzhou and Changshu area and did not have any troops stationed in Shanghai, the alleged daily forced purchases from various shops were clearly not true, or were impersonated by other troops, deliberately undermining the reputation of our division. Furthermore, our division has been stationed in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou and other places for more than two years, and there has never been a forced purchase incident. This further proves that it has already been reported and thoroughly investigated. In addition to telegraphing the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to expedite the investigation, as the reputation of our division is at stake, I respectfully request that you correct this matter."

### Old Case of Suspected Gold and Currency Trading; Cracked Last Summer, Indictment Only Now

[Our Report] The Shanghai office of Deyuan Salt Shop, formerly the Tongyi Bank, with Shen Boya as the person in charge, ostensibly ceased operations of Tongyi during the authorities' ban on black market gold and currency trading, and ostensibly leased the premises to Deyuan as an office. In reality, this was a cover for continuing black market trading. The police discovered this, and on June 14 of last year, officers were dispatched to investigate. They found multiple checks totaling 8.93978 billion yuan, two gold bars, and over 20 yuan in foreign currency on Shen Shanqi, an accountant at the shop, Qiu Zizhang, an employee of the Nanjing headquarters, Shen's friend Yan Yongxiang, neighbor Qin Wenyuan, and Fan Zizhong, who was visiting a friend at the shop.

### Business Circles in Both National and Communist Controlled Areas Planning Barter Trade; Coal Supply Secured; Pork Supply to be Facilitated; Current Problem Lies in Finding a Barter Location

[Central News Agency] Affected by the war, the product sales and raw material sources of the business community are becoming increasingly difficult, and the overall situation is precarious. An effort to rescue themselves is now brewing, aiming to promote extensive barter trade between the business communities of the National and Communist controlled areas through their own unity and efforts, so that goods can flow smoothly and each can get what they need. Qian Chengxu, manager of the National Goods Ten Factories Export Promotion Office, which is carrying out this work, has reached concrete conclusions after contacting business circles along the Nanjing-Shanghai line in recent days. Two representatives have been dispatched to northern Jiangsu to discuss the details of implementing barter trade with the business community there, and to investigate transportation routes. (According to the above situation, it was seen in this newspaper yesterday.) Qian told reporters yesterday that the sales of industrial products in southern Jiangsu are narrowing day by day. For example, in Wujin, the average monthly supply of cotton cloth to northern Jiangsu was 10,000 bolts in the past, but now it is only 800 to 900 bolts. Southern Jiangsu urgently needs cotton, coal, soybeans, pork, etc. In northern Jiangsu, there is an urgent need for sugar, hardware, cloth, and western medicine from southern Jiangsu. The business communities in both regions are eagerly hoping that barter trade will be realized as soon as possible, and the government and the Chinese Communist Party have expressed their agreement and believe that they can obtain assistance. The current problem is to find a location under variable permission as a place for the exchange of goods between the two regions. Its safety is absolutely guaranteed. The coal exchange location has been found to be Yuxikou, opposite Wuhu, and the capital can soon obtain a monthly supply of 60,000 tons of coal from that location. The original location for other goods exchange stations was Jingjiang, but it is currently difficult to decide. More details can be obtained after the representatives return to Shanghai. At that time, he will request the military authorities to provide protection. Qian said that the current source of pork in Shanghai is mostly purchased from northern Jiangsu in silver dollars, which is very expensive. In the future, sugar may be transported for exchange.

### Incensed the Military; Misfortune Strikes; Two Boatmen Shot and Wounded; One in Critical Condition

[Our Report] Zhu Xiaoer, 54, who works as a rice boatman, was carrying over ten stones of white rice last night around 8:00 PM. His boat was berthed outside the Bentang Lane Bridge on the Suzhou River. Five straw boats belonging to a certain army unit were berthed nearby, preparing to depart for another location. As they were moving from west to east, the Suzhou River was crowded with boats, and the waterways were blocked. Soldiers escorting the straw boats ordered Zhu's boat to move out of the way. Zhu ordered his assistant, Xu Liujin, 32, to jointly push the boat away. However, a cargo boat was blocking the way in front, and Zhu was unable to move the boat, which angered the soldiers on the straw boat at the rear. The soldiers crossed several boats, aimed their rifles at Zhu's boat, and fired one shot, hitting Zhu Xiaoer in the right abdomen and right finger, and also wounding assistant Xu Liujin in the left leg. Both were bleeding profusely. The neighboring boat called the fire department, which dispatched an ambulance to the Public Concession Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, the hospital notified the Water Police Bureau to send officers to investigate. However, the soldiers who fired the shots and the straw boats had already disappeared. It is reported that after Zhu and Xu were admitted to the hospital, Zhu, due to his old age and the gunshot wound to his vital abdomen, was in critical condition despite surgery by the doctor.

### Control Yuan Receives New Complaint Letter Regarding the Handling of Northeastern Goods Disputes

### Xi Demao Arrives in Shanghai; Trip to the United States Uncertain

Silver Loan Matter Subsides

[Our Report] China Bank General Manager Xi Demao arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM aboard the President Wilson from Hong Kong. The ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai for the United States on the 9th. Xi hurried off the ship and went to the China Bank on the Bund for rest. Xi was accompanied by senior bank officials Yu Yingjie, Lin Weiying, and Dai Zhi. According to a magnate from the bank who went to the port to welcome Xi yesterday, "I can guarantee that General Manager Xi will not go to the United States." Since the central authorities approved the restoration of silver dollar circulation in the new financial plan, news has spread from the central government that it will borrow silver from the United States to increase the amount of silver dollars minted. When Xi was in Hong Kong, he once consulted with Song Ziwen, Xu Kan, Yu Hongjun, and others, and then it was reported that Xi would represent our country to the United States to negotiate a silver loan. However, the initial response from the United States seemed uninterested in the silver loan and became colder. Therefore, it is expected that Xi will have some considerations before going to the United States. According to another source, although the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) prohibits the circulation and use of silver dollars in its area after the public announcement of silver dollars, the CCP government is vigorously seeking to obtain the materials of the government area, and the government is considering appropriate countermeasures to this. In addition, the price of silver in the United States is higher than in China. If silver is lent to China, it may still flow back into the United States. The failure of this silver loan is actually related to these two issues.

[Our Report] According to a CCP telegram from Beiping on the 7th, the Beiping Military Control Commission is strictly cracking down on silver dollar trading and arresting such silver dollar dealers. From March 2 to 4, 116 people have been arrested by the Public Security Bureau. All silver dollars were confiscated and handed over to the Beiping Branch of the People's Bank. It is said that the Beiping Military Control Commission announced this ban on February 28. Currently, most silver dollar dealers in various silver dollar markets have automatically changed careers, but "illegal activities are being carried out secretly," and have not yet been eliminated.

### Land Reform in Zhejiang

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Chu Yusheng

[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 6th] When the former Chairman of Zhejiang Province, Chen Gongbo, first took office, he held a tea party for reporters. After emphasizing ensuring public security and increasing production, a reporter invited the provincial government official to speak, saying, "Considering the current economic situation in Zhejiang, it is not an industrial economy but an agricultural economy. The factors causing unrest today should be sought within the agricultural economy. We feel that land reform is extremely important."

Chen Yi was determined to implement land reform in Zhejiang Province and formally passed the land reform plan and measures in a provincial government meeting at the end of the 37th year. His

Main Points

were as follows: (1) Restrict the maximum area of land ownership. Except for the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed, and educational or charitable organizations that maintain their livelihoods through land, after appropriately retaining cultivated land, the remainder shall be distributed to tenant farmers and owner-cultivators. Within ten years, all 2,500,891 tenant farmer and semi-owner-cultivator households in the province should obtain their own cultivated land from the 20,046,461 mu of land they currently tenant. At the same time, thoroughly implement the 25% rent reduction, reasonably regulate wage labor wages, and protect tenant farmers and wage laborers who are unable to become owner-cultivators. (2) The maximum area of land ownership is 50 mu for families with five or more members and 25 mu for families with fewer than five members. Monks, Taoists, the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed are allowed to retain non-self-cultivated land at a rate of 5 mu per person. Each ancestral hall is allowed 50 mu. Excess land will be distributed to the original tenant farmers, wage laborers, military dependents, demobilized soldiers, and other farmers who need land for self-cultivation, with the township as the distribution unit. (3) Implementation schedule: In the first period, two counties will be started in the first year and completed in five years. Four counties will be started in the second year and completed in five years. Eleven counties will be started in the third year and completed in five years. Eleven counties will be started in the fourth year and completed in five years. Twelve counties will be started in the fifth year and completed in five years. A total of 840,387 owner-cultivator households should be supported, and 6,604,643 mu of cultivated land should be adjusted and distributed. In the second period, thirteen counties will be started in the sixth year and completed in five years. Thirteen counties will be started in the seventh year and completed in four years. Twelve counties will be started in the eighth year and completed in five years. A total of 1,668,531 owner-cultivator households should be supported, and 13,441,818 mu of cultivated land should be adjusted and distributed. (4) The cost for ten years is estimated at 5 shi of rice per mu, totaling 100,023,130 shi. After deliberation by the provincial government, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Pinghu, one city and two counties, were determined as the implementation counties for the first year of the first period, and implementation would begin this year.

After Chen resigned, Zhou Fengzhang succeeded him as the head of Zhejiang Province. In the administrative program he proposed for Zhejiang Province in the 38th year, he specifically listed one item, stating that land reform would continue to be implemented. His original words were as follows: "Implement land reform by selecting counties and cities to conduct pilot programs in a

gentle

manner that does not disturb the people, to achieve the goal of 'land to the tiller.' In counties that have not yet implemented land reform, the 25% rent reduction and restriction of land rent should still be thoroughly implemented, and tenant farmers should be actively protected and owner-cultivators supported." From this, we should know that the leaders of the Zhejiang Provincial Government have seen the knot of current social unrest in rural villages and have thus risen to take this measure.

Speaking of Zhejiang, the three prefectures of Hang (zhou), Jia (xing), and Hu (zhou) (i.e., Wu and Yue) are commonly known as the Western Zhejiang region, while the eight prefectures of Jin (hua), Qu (zhou), Yan (zhou), Wen (zhou), He (zhou), Chu (zhou), Ning (bo), and Shao (xing) are commonly known as the Eastern Zhejiang region. The Western Zhejiang region is located in the Taihu Lake basin and along the Qiantang River, Huangpu River, etc., and is therefore a fertile plain rich in products. The Eastern Zhejiang region is mostly mountainous, with the Siming, Kuaiji, and Kuocang Mountains being the largest, their mountain ranges spread throughout the counties of Eastern Zhejiang.

Western Zhejiang

is closer to the sea, has more land than mountains, and has seen a greater influx of foreign culture. There is also less isolation compared to Eastern Zhejiang. Although many landlords in Western Zhejiang own more than 100 mu of land, they generally transfer the perpetual tenancy rights to tenant farmers. With perpetual tenancy rights, the tenant farmers can manage the land well. This has led to the formation of many large tenant farmers who rent land from Landlord A and Landlord B and then sublet it to small tenant farmers. These large tenant farmers are better off than the small tenant farmers, and even better off than the landlords. In the past, China's land system fostered landlords who did not work and yet profited. Since the times have been progressing, it has gradually become difficult for landlords to live off their land. I once conducted an investigation in the Suzhou and Jiaxing areas, which were once paradises for the landlord class, but are now very declining. After the implementation of the 25% rent reduction, landlords in the plains have been greatly threatened, increasing their burdens and troubles. Therefore, landlords in the plains are trending towards decline. What has risen in their place is the large tenant farmer, who exists in the cracks and can exploit both sides.

The situation in

Eastern Zhejiang

is completely opposite. Because the area is mostly mountainous, the influx of foreign culture has been slower. There are fewer large landlords than in Western Zhejiang, and there are no perpetual tenancy rights. Because there are no perpetual tenancy rights, tenant farmers who rent land must be filial to the landlords, otherwise, they will not be able to rent the land next year. At the same time, the landlords determine the price of land rent. Although the landlords own very little land, they have the power to lend it out, so everything is better for them than for the landlords in Western Zhejiang. Zhejiang Province was the first to implement the 25% rent reduction, and the results have been the most remarkable. However, many counties in Eastern Zhejiang have not yet widely implemented it, which has led to the formation of a more superior position for landlords.

From these two comparisons, we can know that the land situation in Eastern Zhejiang is more serious than in Western Zhejiang. Reflected in the current situation, the unrest in Eastern Zhejiang is much more significant than in Western Zhejiang.

Currently, the land reform being implemented in Zhejiang Province has selected Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Pinghu, two counties and one city with fewer problems, as the first-period

pilot

counties. We believe that the implementation of land reform must be aimed at the areas with the most current problems and implemented thoroughly to eliminate problems and stabilize the region. Some people say that Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Pinghu have completed surveying, while many other counties have not. However, we should quickly conduct surveying while actively implementing land reform to avoid the problems in areas with many problems from becoming more numerous, making it almost impossible to start implementation in the future. We are not opposed to conducting land reform in Western Zhejiang first, but land reform in Western Zhejiang must rationally distribute the land of landlords while reducing the exploitation by large tenant farmers. At the same time, seeing the urgency of the situation in Eastern Zhejiang and the complexity of the problems, it seems necessary to avoid the easy and choose the difficult, and prescribe the right medicine for the disease.

In the main points of the Zhejiang Province land reform method, there is a point that monks, Taoists, the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed are allowed to retain non-self-cultivated land at a rate of 5 mu per person, which we also need to discuss. Because

monks and Taoists

are recognized by the general public as a leisure class. When I visited the Shiwu Cave in the spring of the 35th year, I met a monk who spoke extensively about the principle that monks must engage in production. He said, "Monks today can no longer eat for free. They should contribute some labor to earn their living, which is the meaning of life." We cannot foster a leisure class that idles and profits without working. Therefore, if monks and Taoists retain cultivated land, they must cultivate it themselves to be reasonable. Also, the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed in the current Chinese rural areas all work diligently themselves. The reference must be to cities. Since it is in cities, we should enrich the facilities of the welfare homes with the land that the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed should receive to support more of them. Wouldn't that be better? The above can also be said to be a gentle policy.

Land reform has already begun in Zhejiang Province, but

at the beginning,

the vast majority of farmers must be made to understand it to avoid intermediaries from creating confusion. Therefore, it must be coordinated with education so that intellectuals and even primary and secondary school students can go deep into rural areas to explain various aspects of land reform.

Of course, today's rural areas in Zhejiang have also reached a state of decline. Cultivation has been abandoned, and farmhouses and farm tools are frequently dilapidated. When we carry out land reform, we must also cultivate the vitality of rural areas, improve rural life, and enrich rural education so that rural areas can be revived.

### Grenade Explodes in Jiading, Four Elementary School Students Injured, One Dead

[This Newspaper, Jiading, 6th] At around 4:00 PM on the 5th, students from Lianxi Elementary School picked up a rifle grenade at the Northwest City River, which suddenly exploded, injuring four and killing one. After the incident, a reporter went to investigate and learned that the garrison held live-fire exercises at the northwest corner of the city, resulting in a small number of unexploded rifle grenades being left in the area around the Northwest City River. When Lianxi Elementary School outside the West Gate was dismissed from school, a group of students returned home. Passing through the area, they saw a rifle grenade left in the Shen family's vegetable garden. One of them bent down to pick it up and look at it when suddenly there was a loud explosion, and shrapnel flew in all directions. Five people in the crowd fell to the ground, covered in blood and flesh, a tragic sight. Among them, Zhaoming, Wang Qiutao, Zhang Genrong, and Lu Qiya had their legs and feet destroyed by the explosion. Liang Zhanyun, eight years old, had his stomach torn open, and his intestines flowed out, and he died immediately.

### Spring Outing to Mudu Town, Four Robbers Steal Gold Jewelry

[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 4th] Yu Zurong, an attached member of the Nanxun Town Self-Defense Brigade in this county, went to Mudu with two female relatives in a carriage on the 2nd. After Yu and the others finished touring the mountains, they took the original carriage back to Suzhou. Unexpectedly, about eight li from Mudu, they were suddenly robbed by four robbers with guns. The four robbers were originally the ones who had taken the same car to Lingyan Temple earlier. This time, they robbed more than one tael of gold jewelry and Yu's own six-inch pistol. After the robbery, they fled to Baimajian. The coachman is suspected and has been handed over to the General Bureau. The county government ordered Wu Xi, the district chief of Zhu, to solve the case within a time limit.

### Qinghai "Shawa" Go to Goldfields in Early Summer

[This Newspaper, Xining, 1st (Airmail)] Qinghai counties previously issued orders regarding "Shawa" (i.e., gold diggers) going to the goldfields to dig for gold: Before the end of the third month of the lunar calendar this year, all were prohibited from going to the goldfields to work. The Qinghai Provincial Government recently issued orders to the counties because this gold mining work is very necessary for the people's livelihood, allowing these many "Shawa" to go to the goldfields to start work in early April of the lunar calendar. However, they are still not allowed to go too far, such as Xingxiu Hai and other places.

### Unable to Study in India, Ma Xuandao and Others Return to Qinghai

[This Newspaper, Xining, 3rd (Airmail)] Four young people, including Aheng Ma Xuandao, who were funded and sent to India for further study by the Qinghai Provincial Government, flew to Shanghai last October, intending to transfer to India. Later, due to changes in national affairs, it was not easy to complete the procedures for going abroad, so they decided to stop going abroad. Now, they have returned to Xining.

### Banditry Rampant in Xiuwen, Guizhou

[This Newspaper, Guiyang, 2nd (Airmail)] Xiuwen County, less than a hundred li from Guiyang, has recently had a major disturbance. Ma Huailin, a member of the Provincial Assembly of the county, and Xu Tianen, the head of the Grain Bureau, incited ignorant villagers in Xiaoqing Township, not far from the county seat, and raised the slogan "No grain tax, no conscription." Using the seven or eight guns they had as capital, they confiscated the guns of the police teams in the nearby four or five townships and now have 500 to 600 rioters and more than 100 long and short guns, posing a threat to attack the county seat. Assemblyman Ma was originally a major special agent sent by the Kuomintang to work behind enemy lines in Shandong during the War of Resistance. He can be considered a loyal person. After returning home after the victory, he was repeatedly frustrated in politics. He failed to win the election for National Assembly representative and deputy speaker of the Provincial Assembly. It is unknown why he suddenly took this action today when the Kuomintang is going through difficult times. Chairman Gu Zhenglun could not bear the local decay and is now urging local elders and female legislator Chen Mingxian in Guiyang to persuade him not to cause trouble. At the same time, he is deploying troops and generals to "prepare for war and seek peace." People familiar with the political situation in Guizhou say that this unfortunate event will not be difficult to end in the short term.

The root cause of instability in Guizhou is the influence of the neighboring provinces' laissez-faire policies on the planting of opium, coupled with the incitement of people with political ambitions. The villagers are ignorant and naturally restless. The newly appointed county magistrates in the province's 79 counties are mostly military personnel. If they can combine politics with military affairs, the banditry in Guizhou will still not be difficult to quell.

### Reader Consulting, Legal Interpretation: Question Regarding Redemption of Dianquan Rights

Answered by Lawyer Tang Mingshi

Shao Shenkui asks: My friend A's father, B, pawned 1.2 mu of good farmland to C ten years ago, with a middleman as guarantor. At that time, A was young. Now A is an adult and has learned that the contract has long expired. He intends to redeem it, but his father and the middleman have all died, and there is no one to prove it. Although he has repeatedly requested C, he has been refused and falsely claimed that it has long been sold outright. It is found that the above-mentioned farmland has not yet been transferred with a tax deed. Please ask: (1) Can he sue in court without hiring a lawyer? (2) What is the difference between a pawned land deed and an outright sale land deed? (3) Is C's excuse that the redemption period has been too long a valid reason?

[Answer] (1) The parties to a lawsuit can file a lawsuit in court, but if they hire a lawyer to draft the complaint, handle the procedures, cite the law, and organize the facts, it will be more thorough. Non-lawyers cannot represent lawsuits, and shysters are strictly prohibited by the court. However, if the parties understand the law themselves and feel that they can handle it, then legally, it is not necessary to hire a lawyer to represent them. (2) Dianquan is a unique type of right in our country, and the Civil Code has provisions for it, which is very different from an outright sale. (3) The time limit for redemption of pawned property, etc., are all detailed in Chapter 8 of the Civil Code on Dianquan. Please purchase a law book and read it carefully to understand.

### Changzhou Cracks Down on Illegal Troops: A Major Case of Kidnapping for Ransom

More than eighty people have redeemed themselves with rice.

[This Newspaper, Wujin, 5th] The Ministry of National Defense ordered the establishment of supplementary training groups in various places to accommodate vagrant soldiers and reorganize them into training. The intention was good. After receiving the order, Changzhou established a regiment outside the West Gate in the fake Taiyu Rice Factory. Since the establishment of the regiment, more than eighty ordinary people around the West Gate have been arrested in the name of vagrant soldiers. After being taken, they were asked to name a price in rice for their release, which was the same as kidnapping for ransom. The civilians, afraid of the power of the troops, were extremely uneasy. After receiving the report, the police sub-bureau of the district, under the instruction of Deputy Commander Jiao of the pacification zone, immediately started investigating. On the 4th, they arrested Zhang Yonghong, a key criminal serving in the supplementary training group. Then, they arrested Qian Er and Shi Sibao. After being interrogated by the criminal police team, Zhang confessed that he was originally a character dismantler from Dongtai. He was introduced by a fellow villager of the chief of the supplementary training class, surnamed Li, and was able to work in the regiment. He confessed in detail that the regiment arbitrarily arrested good people in the name of supplementary training, falsely accusing them of being vagrant soldiers, in order to extort money. A total of about eighty people were released after paying rice for their release. He was used and obeyed orders, and he had also arrested more than thirty people, and more than ten of them had been released. Because the case involves the military, the police station has submitted a report to the Pacification Zone Command for instructions.

### Gansu Province Reform Movement

— Our Reporter Song Lin

[Our Newspaper Lanzhou, 3rd Dispatch] The provincial government reform movement recently advocated in Gansu did not just start now. In the past, all those who governed Gansu have advocated for reform and emphasized progress. Chairman Zhu Shaoliang's "Seeking progress in stability," Chairman Gu Zhenglun's "Seeking stability in progress," and now Chairman Guo Jiqiao's "Seeking progress in unity" all call for reform and progress. Chief Zhang Zhizhong once expressed great emotion about "reform" at a networking event in the cultural circles of Lanzhou. He said, "Everyone is constantly shouting 'reform,' but after so many years of reform, where is the reform? Where is the new?"

He then pointed out which elements were hindering the government's reform and called on the stubborn factions to be careful not to be swallowed and destroyed by the trend of the times. Now may be a

Better Opportunity for Reform

Because the current situation is the most difficult, but also the greatest. The relatively comfortable situation in the Northwest, especially in Gansu, has created a good opportunity where reform is necessary for survival. Therefore, Chairman Guo Jiqiao convened several provincial government reform seminars in late last month, attended by personnel above the section chief level from various provincial units, determined to eliminate all obstacles, improve people's lives, and seek comprehensive peace.

There are many reform items, covering almost all provincial government operations. The main ones are as follows:

Personnel Reform

Streamlining agencies, merging those with similar functions and businesses, implementing widespread layoffs, and encouraging talent to go to the countryside to strengthen grassroots organizations. The provincial government has plans for the employment of those laid off, and it is said that unemployment will not occur.

Military Service Reform

In the past, military service almost formed a distorted phenomenon where the poor were conscripted and the rich were exempt. In the future, the provincial government will simplify laws and procedures, lower the conscription standards, and reduce the scope of exemptions, so that the people can serve fairly. The method of conscription will adopt a combination of conscription and recruitment, employ cadres and talents, and give preferential treatment to military families.

Financial Reform

Restoring the cycle of peacetime financial aid to finance, financial development of the economy, and economic enrichment of finance. Redefining the silver tax collection, collecting silver in areas using silver, to balance the budget and stabilize the currency. In addition, restoring the minting of silver coins to save the fate of the currency system.

Land Policy

Land policy reform: to gradually equalize land ownership, impose increased value tax on those with more land, and collect urban land tax. Land reform will be implemented first in Yuzhong and Yongdeng counties.

Social Economy

Social Relief Reform: A mutual assistance plan for counties, cities, and bao has been drafted to help the poor with the wealth of the rich. Because the gap between the rich and the poor in Gansu is too large, the poor cannot be saved, and the rich cannot be at peace, so it is necessary to equalize wealth and implement social policies moderately.

Of the five key reform points reported above, some have been decided in provincial government meetings, and some are still under careful study for implementation methods. However, there are

Two Plans

That will be implemented ahead of time: one is the "Self-Defense Reform Plan," and the other is the "Financial and Economic Reform Plan." The latter stipulates that in addition to restoring the mint (estimated to produce 2,000 coins per day) and printing auxiliary coins, provincial public bonds and construction lottery tickets will be issued to encourage wealthy people to contribute more money to overcome the current economic crisis.

Regarding the future of this Gansu provincial government reform, Secretary-General Ding Yizhong of the provincial government made a statement at a press conference. He said, "The future of reform is optimistic." He analyzed the

Optimistic Factors

As follows: (1) Reform is necessary for survival; without reform, there is no solution to any situation. (2) Reform is necessary for peace. Based on various signs and sincerity from the government, we believe that peace will eventually be achieved. Because of the balance of power for peace, the government is now "preparing for war and seeking peace," while the Northwest is "advocating self-defense and peace." No matter how many twists and turns and difficulties are encountered in the process, as long as both sides can

Achieve National Peace

It is only a matter of time. Therefore, the Northwest should cooperate with the central government's decision-making in a reformative manner. At the same time, our policies and doctrines are close, so we can welcome peace.

After the central government issued the financial and economic reform plan, Chairman Guo also issued a written statement, pointing out that many financial and economic measures in Gansu have long been fully in line with the reform plan promulgated by the central government this time. In the future, we must continue to work harder to promote according to the original plan, and all problems will naturally be solved easily. He called on people from all walks of life to effectively publicize the various reform plans that the provincial government is about to promulgate and implement, and the people must have strong confidence, then the success of the plan implementation is naturally expected.

### National Bank Adopts Two Methods to Allocate Gold Bullion Needed by Gold Shops - Yesterday's Selling Price Was 228,000 Yuan Per Taels

[Our Report] The National Bank started allocating gold bullion needed by the local gold shops for making jewelry yesterday. To ensure caution and establish great trust, a small committee was specially formed to be responsible for reviewing the allocated price and quantity. The committee consists of members from the Control Yuan, the Gold Management Bureau, the Central Bank, the trust departments of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, and the Financial Stabilization Committee. The bank will continue to allocate the required gold bullion to the gold shops. There are two methods of allocation:

(1) The National Bank will notify the Gold Shops Association before 11:00 AM, and the association will inform each gold shop to submit the quantity of gold they need to purchase before 11:00 AM to the National Bank. The bank's committee will determine the price and quantity to be sold, and then notify the gold shops to bring cash or National Bank cashier's checks to purchase before 1:00 PM; otherwise, the transaction will be canceled.

(2) The National Bank will notify each gold shop in advance of the price at which gold will be sold today, and the quantity will not be limited, allowing each gold shop to purchase freely.

The bank used the second method to sell yesterday, notifying each gold shop that the price of gold was 228,000 yuan per tael (containing 1,000 parts of gold), but no one came to negotiate the purchase. In addition to the above two methods, if the bank believes that it does not intend to sell or allocate on a certain day, it will not notify the gold shops, stating that there will be no supply of goods on that day.

### Gold and Silver Open Market May Be Established Within the Week

[Our Report] Liu Gongyun, President of the Central Bank, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning after completing his official duties in Beijing. Liu immediately went to the National Bank to work as usual. All sectors have high hopes for Liu's trip and are particularly concerned about the progress of Liu's instructions in Beijing. According to the bank's spokesperson, who answered reporters yesterday, the gold and silver open market is currently being actively prepared and may be established within this week. The National Bank has decided to strengthen its efforts and take active measures to stabilize rising prices, which will be effective in the shortest possible time. As for the implementation details of the financial part of the new financial plan, some have already been implemented. Other plans, such as the establishment of a financial open market, will also be announced and implemented one after another in the coming days. As for the issuance of gold yuan notes with a face value of 1,000 yuan, the National Bank has long been approved to announce the issuance. Regarding the rumor that a large number of gold yuan notes from North China have flowed into Shanghai, the spokesperson explained that the total amount of gold yuan notes in North China is limited, and sporadic infiltration is inevitable. However, due to transportation restrictions and inspections, large-scale inflows into Shanghai seem impossible.

[Another Report] Regarding the issue of establishing a gold and silver open market in this city, it has gradually become concrete since the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank jointly began preparations. Liu Gongyun, President of the National Bank, had a long discussion with Finance Minister Xu Kan when he went to Beijing the day before yesterday, and the procedures and methods have been decided. After Liu returned to Shanghai yesterday morning, he also summoned the heads of the Gold Industry Association and the Gold Shops Association to discuss various technical issues related to the establishment of the market. According to sources, if there are no unexpected obstacles, the new gold and silver market is expected to be established within this week.

### Thousand-Yuan Notes Have Not Yet Appeared - Will Be Issued Discretionally Based on Actual Needs

[Our Report] It was rumored in the market yesterday that the new 1,000-yuan notes recently announced by the Central Bank have already appeared. A reporter inquired with a confidential staff member of the bank, who said that the new 1,000-yuan notes have not yet been issued. They will be issued discretionally based on actual needs in the future.

[United Credit Investigation Agency News] Gold yuan notes with a face value of 1,000 yuan have not yet officially appeared this morning. According to the Issuing Bureau of the National Bank, these large banknotes will be officially issued within one or two days. As for the current shortage of banknotes, the main reason is still the disconnect between rising prices and issuance. It is expected that the current banknote panic can be improved after the new banknotes are launched.

Yesterday (7th), the Central Bank still limited the withdrawal of banknotes from each branch to 30%. According to the person in charge of the bank, the bank is actively working on a solution, and the banknote shortage will be relieved soon.

### Bank Bureaus Continue to Dispatch

[Our Report] National bank bureaus continued to dispatch 68.784 million yuan yesterday, foreign firms dispatched 73.572 million yuan, large exchange banks dispatched 114.228 million yuan, and small exchange banks dispatched 119.016 million yuan.

### Rice Prices Rise Again - Flour, Grain, and Cooking Oil Also See Price Increases

Rice market prices rise without end, with high production prices. In particular, the prices in the Nangang production area are not in line with the Shanghai market, so very little arrives. The opening price this morning jumped sharply by 3-4,000 yuan, but the market was sluggish due to the flat prices outside the circle, and buyers hesitated, so the price returned slightly. In the Southern market, white japonica rice was 25,500 yuan, a sharp increase of 3,300 yuan, and early thin rice increased by 2,5600 yuan. In the Northern market, white japonica rice also opened at 25,500 yuan, an increase of 1,200 yuan, thin rice increased by 1,800 yuan, and special japonica rice reached 27,000 yuan. A total of 7,677 shi of goods arrived in the two markets.

Flour

Slightly increased, due to rumors that the Central Bank would sell materials and gold notes, and merchants were wary of high prices and eager to sell. The market was low at the beginning, but after the close, the price of gold notes rose sharply and then fell back slightly, and the market rebounded again. Old trucks opened at 10,900 yuan, fell slightly by 200 yuan at the close, and rebounded by 100 yuan after the close with strong purchases from retail investors. Warships traded at 10,330 yuan, and rebounded to 10,450 yuan in the aftermarket. Bran rose slightly by 400 yuan, and large packages traded at 8,400 yuan.

Grains

The market continued to rise. Soybeans were firm at first and then fell back. Hankou car beans initially rose by 150 yuan, but then it was heard that the oil cake market was sluggish and factory demand weakened, and the market returned to its original level. Green beans have not been seen opening, and the asking price is about 20,000 yuan. Raw peanuts rose by 300 yuan, corn tended to go downstream, red sorghum did not rise much, and sesame and mung beans sold well and rose by 10%.

Cooking Oil

The price was very sluggish at the opening, because it had risen too much last week, and merchants sold at high prices. Vegetable oil opened at 87,000 yuan, and then buyers took advantage of the low price, and the price rose to 94,000 yuan. At the close, the vegetable oil was 92,000 yuan and the soybean oil was 96,000 yuan, each rising by 2,000 yuan. Jittetsu brand vegetable oil was 113,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 3,000 yuan, and soybean cake rose by 500 yuan. Changzi brand cake once reached 10,000 yuan, and closed at 9,600 yuan.

### Chinese Stocks Turn Weak Across the Board - Taiwan Sugar One Tooth Fell to the Limit

The trend of Chinese stocks turned weak across the board. The opening prices of each stock were weak due to the rumors that the Central Bank would sell gold, silver, and stocks in large quantities. Although it was once pulled up by major securities dealers in the middle, the market fell sharply again due to the still-tight monetary policy. Yongsha opened at 5 yuan and fluctuated all the way down after the opening, once falling to a low of 4.77 yuan around 11 o'clock. At 11:30, overnight major bulls tried their best to pull up the market, and the market rose all the way up, once reaching a high of 5.2 yuan. Selling at high prices, retail investors followed, and the market fell all the way down, falling directly into the 5 yuan mark, closing at 4.82 yuan. Mayer also trended downward, opening at 1.9 yuan. Zheng Zhong'an raised the board, with a high of 1.96 yuan. The bulls took profits, and retail investors went short, and the market fell to 1.77 yuan at the close. Taiwan Sugar continued to be sluggish, opening at 31,000 yuan, and once fell to the limit in the middle. Near the close, the market was slightly pulled up to 28,000 yuan due to the entry of bank gangs.

### Foreign Stocks See Both Gains and Losses

Yesterday, foreign stocks saw both gains and losses. The money supply in the circle was still tight, and the overnight interest rate was 7 cents. Major dealers were not eager to buy, and retail investors were mostly on the sidelines. However, foreign firms were slightly more willing to buy. Yisha traded at 9,000 yuan and 9,200 yuan, slightly rebounding by about 100 yuan compared to the previous weekend. British Union also saw a slight increase, trading at 940 yuan and 970 yuan. Yeguang rose by 400 yuan compared to the previous Saturday, trading at 2,800 yuan and 3,000 yuan. Jardine Matheson still stood firm, trading at a high of 27,000 yuan and 30,000 yuan, an increase of more than 1,000 yuan compared to the previous Saturday.

### Yarn Prices Are Flourishing - Cotton Cloth Fluctuates at Low Levels

The yarn market is flourishing. There is strong demand from South China. Local fabricators are particularly fond of fine yarn. Sentiment remains firm, and yarn prices have reached new highs. The price of 42s Blue Phoenix yarn fluctuated greatly. Initially, it was 1.55 million yuan, and then it jumped sharply to a high of 1.81 million yuan. Later, as there were many floating profits and sales, the price fell to 1.7 million yuan at the end, up 160,000 yuan from Saturday. 40s Jincheng also rose by 130,000 yuan. 32s Yinyue fluctuated from 1.14 million yuan to a maximum of 1.23 million yuan, and finally closed at 1.2 million yuan, up 60,000 yuan.

The price of 21s Shuangma spot goods initially opened at 860,000 yuan, and after reaching a high of 960,000 yuan, it was loosened, and finally closed at 890,000 yuan, down 10,000 yuan alone.

20s Shuangma rose slightly by 40,000 yuan, and other grades such as Tiannv and Jincheng also followed up by around 30,000 yuan. 16s Guangming broke through the 800,000 yuan mark, and finally traded at 830,000 yuan. Except for the Boys' Army, which fell by 10,000 yuan, all 10s yarns showed good results.

The cotton cloth market saw rising clearings and falling prices. In the early morning, it was reported that the National Bank would continue to sell large amounts of gold, silver, and materials to contract currency and tighten the money supply, and that the details of the new plan had been drafted and would be submitted to the next administrative meeting for discussion before being announced. As a result, holders were cautious, and most in the street adopted a wait-and-see attitude. After the opening, there was a strong bearish sentiment, and selling pressure was seen surging. Near the close, there were some purchases from Guangdong, and the market improved slightly.

The opening price of Longtou fine cloth was 34,600 yuan, and the opening price of Four Gentlemen yuan cloth was 33,600 yuan. Both fell into a weak position in the middle, and the closing prices were 33,800 yuan and 33,000 yuan, respectively, an increase of 2,500 yuan compared to the previous Saturday's midday close, but a decrease of about 2,000 yuan compared to the off-market asking price the next day. The trend turned upward in the afternoon, and the asking price was generally higher than the midday closing price, plus one day's interest.

### China Textile Sells Yarn

[Our Report] China Textile Construction Company sold yarn yesterday as usual, a total of 6 types, sold 151 pieces, and 76 households were approved to purchase. The selling prices of each count of yarn were: 6s Deputy Sunlight 360,000 yuan, 8s Sunlight 430,000 yuan, 32s Yanghe 1.12 million yuan, 40s Red Race Light 1.56 million yuan, 32s Double Strand Happy Crane 1.45 million yuan, and 42s Double Strand Luma 1.62 million yuan.

### China Textile Company Reduces Yarn Spindles

According to the authorities of China Textile Construction Company, the number of yarn spindles in all textile factories of the company has been reduced by about one-third since the transfer of the two places of Northeast and Tianjin. The yarn spindles of the Textile Construction Company in the Northeast were about 170,000 to 200,000, and the yarn spindles in Tianjin were about 300,000, so a total of 500,000 yarn spindles in these two places were taken over by the Chinese Communist Party. Recently, due to the lack of cotton sources, only about 70% of the 600,000 yarn spindles were opened, and the production of the 300,000 yarn spindles in the Qingdao China Textile Factory has also been greatly reduced due to the shortage of raw materials.

### The 29th Meeting of the Discount and Loan Committee Decided to Continue Handling Industrial Loans in the Shanghai Area

The National Bank Discount and Loan Committee held its 29th meeting at 4:00 PM on the 7th, chaired by President Liu Gongyun, and approved the entry of public utility transportation loans. In addition, industrial loans in the Shanghai area have also been decided to continue handling.

### Industry Advocates Canceling Quotas for Industrial Raw Materials

After Processing Imported Raw Materials, Exported Finished Products Should Be Exempt from Import Tax

After the financial and economic reform plan was announced, the import quotas and controls were greatly relaxed. However, the industrial raw materials industry in this city believes that this control is too strict. They advocate canceling the quotas for industrial raw materials and allowing industrial raw materials to be imported freely. Because there are few industrial raw materials that can be self-sufficient domestically at present. And there are some that cannot be manufactured domestically, but there are many users. In the past, the imports were not enough to be allocated, and in order to develop the domestic industry, it is necessary to cancel the quotas for industrial raw materials.

[Our Report] The Foreign Sales Promotion Committee of the Municipal Industrial Association held its first group meeting at the China Textile Construction Company on the afternoon of the 7th. Wu Weijing, Ouyang Lun, Fu Liangjun, Chen Taoxin, and others attended the meeting. After discussion, it was resolved that for all imported raw materials (limited to raw materials that are insufficient in domestic production or have no production at all) that are processed into finished products for export, the import tariffs should be requested to be fully exempted.

### Coal Shortage Gradually Resolved

The severe coal shortage in Shanghai has been gradually resolved as the transportation of goods in North China has resumed. Last month, a total of 80,274 tons of coal were transported to this city. Among them, 12,100 tons were transported from Kailuan, 15,760 tons of Soviet coal, and 2,714 tons of Taiwanese coal. This month, the amount of coal will be mainly from North China, and it is estimated that more than 50,000 tons can be transported from Kailuan alone, 40,000 tons of Taiwanese coal, more than 10,000 tons of Indian coal, and 20,000 tons of Soviet coal, and there will be other parts of 10,000 tons, for a total of 140,000 tons. After the coal is transported to Shanghai, it will be quickly allocated according to actual needs. Shanghai needs 10 dang tons, and Nanjing needs 3 dang tons.

### Tung Oil Initially Firm, Then Fell Back

The rising trend of tung oil yesterday became more and more intense. The reason was that the price of non-industrial items was rising sharply, there was a surplus of funds in the industry, and merchants unanimously asked for prices. The process moved forward. By the afternoon, top-grade white oil and genuine Pi Xihong were priced at 78,000 yuan, and secondary-brand Xihong and Qing oil were also 8,000 to 10,000 yuan higher than the previous week. However, by the evening close, as the money supply tightened and various commodities leveled off, they also followed steadily. The future can be expected to stabilize.

### Export and Import Management Committee Promotes Sino-Egyptian Trade

[Our Report] In order to promote Sino-Egyptian trade, the Export and Import Management Committee, after consulting with the Egyptian government, has specially allowed importers in that country to purchase native products from our country, such as tea, sesame, textiles, pepper, tobacco, and other goods, in pounds. And in order to promote this trade, the names and addresses of the merchants who are engaged in the export of the above items will be sent to the Embassy of Egypt in China for transfer to the importers in that country, and the embassy will also be requested to send the names and addresses of the importers in that country to the committee for transfer to the exporters in our country. It is learned that the committee has received the list from the embassy and has copied it to the import and export associations and the relevant importers. Any merchants who have not received a notice from the committee and intend to engage in this trade can directly inquire with the committee for details.

### Tea Market Rises Sharply

The tea market yesterday was firm and bullish in the morning, and the process was raised. Then, as the money supply loosened, the buying interest increased again, and sellers took the opportunity to raise prices, making the market even more exciting. Prices were uniformly high, but by the time of the attack, it was suddenly heard that the authorities were selling a large amount of materials, the funds tightened, and the rising trend began to subside. Compared with the previous week, there was a sharp increase. According to the full-day transaction, due to the scarcity of goods, the market was still struggling to rise.

A total of 15 taels were traded in half a day.

### Market Stroll: Observer's Stand

Relying only on two weapons, falsely aiming for two birds with one arrow, conquering the heart is better than conquering the city, the peep show hasn't been dismantled yet.

After a significant rise on Saturday afternoon, everyone believed that the speculative market would be pressured by the authorities when it opened on Monday, and the commodity market would also be affected. Sure enough, that was the case yesterday.

So, the authorities really have the power to sell, really have the power to control the market. Perhaps, but more likely not. Because the rise on Saturday evening was stimulated by rumors of the crossing of the river, and since the rumors have been proven false, the rising momentum naturally disappeared like melting ice.

Speaking of the authorities' power to sell, perhaps it has, but it's not worth taking seriously. Honestly speaking: only selling without buying can suppress prices in the long run, and this is something no country can do. Knowing that the effect of selling is only to temporarily suppress the fire, and in preparation for future selling, they have to take advantage of low prices to buy back. At this time and place, it is easy to sell real goods, but difficult to buy real goods. Selling without buying back, and the fire reigniting is expected, then selling seriously would be too foolish.

Since selling seriously is not worthwhile, but besides selling, there is really nothing else to do but stand by and watch. But standing by and watching is simply not acceptable. Without a solution, they have to come up with one, and that is the authorities' currently popular technique of virtual selling.

What is virtual selling? We have already briefly analyzed it in the past. That is, announcing the sale of gold, banknotes, gauze, and sugar, but actually only announcing the sale of gold and banknotes, while actually selling foreign exchange transfer certificates. Selling gauze and sugar is not entirely nonsense, but there is more thunder than rain. The entire force of suppressing the market is placed on foreign exchange transfer certificates.

Foreign exchange transfer certificates, like gold yuan coupons, are just paper, and the printing is not even as good as gold yuan coupons, but the paper is full of inscrutable writing, mentioning foreign exchange. Those blinded by money, upon hearing the words "foreign exchange," immediately feel secure and trust them. This kind of psychology, though somewhat excusable, is ultimately chilling. Therefore, the authorities also use poison to fight poison. Whenever they deem it necessary to take action to suppress the market, they relentlessly dump large quantities of foreign exchange transfer certificates, regardless of whether there are people in the market who want them. The fewer people who need them, the more aggressively the authorities dump them at lower prices. Whether there is a transaction or not, it is even better if there is no transaction. The price of foreign exchange transfer certificates can be lowered quickly, which then brings down the price of real gold and silver dollars, and can also threaten securities, gauze, and general prices.

Although this kind of virtual selling is mostly traded, who can know the truth? Because everyone does not understand the truth, the plan of virtual selling is successful. Those with funds also believe that credit is tight and raise interest rates excessively. If A raises interest rates like this, B will naturally raise interest rates as well. Thus, even though funds are loose, black market interest rates remain high. With high interest rates, hoarding goods is not necessarily more profitable than lending. With the emergence of this psychology, the virtual selling policy is fully effective.

The speculative market is like a battlefield. On the battlefield, military affairs account for three parts, and politics accounts for seven parts; only then can victory be assured, because conquering the heart is more powerful than conquering the city. In the speculative market, psychological factors are even more important. Therefore, although the authorities are implementing a virtual selling policy today, it is fundamentally different from Pei Tsu-yi's past real-money intervention, but conquering the heart is effective, and virtual selling does not appear to be virtual.

But the peep show cannot be dismantled. Once the peep show is dismantled, then no matter how much you dump foreign exchange transfer certificates, everyone will be indifferent and dismiss it with a laugh. This weapon will then enter its period of rust!

### Overseas Remittance Income Declines Again, Only Over 10,000 US Dollars Per Week

Total Income in February Decreases by Three-Fifths

According to the Bank of China, overseas remittance income has recently decreased sharply, with only over 10,000 US dollars being received each week. This is a significant difference compared to the past. Since the currency reform last year, overseas remittance income has gradually increased, reaching over 4 million US dollars per month by the end of December last year. The income in November last year even reached over 10 million US dollars, almost the same as the pre-war level. However, since the beginning of this year, it has been decreasing daily. The total overseas remittance income in January was over 1 million yuan, a decrease of half compared to December last year. The total income in February was only about 400,000 US dollars, a further decrease of three-fifths compared to January. It is expected to decrease sharply again this month. Although the financial and monetary reform plan stipulates that the exchange rate for overseas remittances should be calculated based on the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates, the price of transfer certificates is still far from the black market price of US dollars, making it difficult to achieve results. Overseas remittance income is a major source of foreign exchange for the country. If the handling is not improved, the future of overseas remittance income is worrying.

### Mediocre Silk

Yesterday's silk market was flat. Credit in the market tightened, black market interest rates suddenly rose, and with the authorities still selling goods to suppress prices, businesses feared an extreme tightening of credit and were unable to turn around. As a result, buying interest was weak and the market lacked the strength to rise.

No. 120 Yuanguang's new spot goods opened at 1.03 million in the morning, with next-day financing at 1.1 million. Then, as various dealers slightly pushed up prices, confidence strengthened, and the market briefly rose to 1.2 million to 1.25 million. After the high, news came that gold in outside circles had fallen, and asking prices fell again slightly. Before the close, silk hovered around 1.2 million, and finally closed at 1.23 million.

Due to the sharp rise in foreign exchange certificates yesterday, raw silk was aggressively bought. Superior grade opened at 1.6 million in the morning with supply. Afterwards, gold opened lower, credit in the industry tightened, and the market softened, with asking prices falling by 50,000 yuan. Due to technical buying, prices rose again, hovering around 1.62 million before the close. Finally, the market stabilized, holders held firm, and the market closed at 1.65 million yuan.

The silk and satin market was still strong yesterday, with firm trading. Initially, prices were supported by rising raw material costs. Subsequently, gold prices fell back and credit tightened suddenly, with many selling off, and trading softened slightly. However, rising yarn and cloth prices from outside the industry continued to support the market. The American Asia face cloth opened at 780,000 in the morning. Supporters raised prices and pushed the market higher, once rising to 790,000 and even 800,000. After the high, as credit tightened and black market lending rates rose to 80 yuan, speculators became deeply cautious, and many retailers sold off, and the market turned soft, falling to 770,000 yuan. Afterwards, it hovered at the low end. By the time of the noon close, cotton yarn and cotton cloth prices rose, and buying interest in the market increased slightly. However, due to distribution issues, firms hedged their positions, and there was a lack of strength to push prices higher. The noon close was at 790,000.

### Joe Louis's Autobiography (4)

— Translated by Canglong

After defeating Schmeling in 1938, I didn't fight again that year. I really had a good time with the money I won. Some people say that I was just wasting money, but that's not true. I organized a softball team and named it the "Brown Bombers," and I played first base. We took long-distance buses, traveled to various states in America, ate well, stayed in hotels everywhere. At the end of a softball season, I spent a total of 50,000 yuan for this. I don't think this was a waste. I had my fun!

I also helped a lot of unlucky old boxers. I don't think I did anything wrong. I also often donated to women's nursing homes in Detroit. The women in the nursing homes, some of whom were ninety to one hundred years old, called me "son." So, I had almost twenty mothers. When I had a lot of income, I also spent a lot of money on strange clothes for myself. This was because the clothes I wore when I was a child were ragged. At one time, I had a hundred suits, all custom-made in New York and Hollywood. After all these clothes wore out, I am no longer interested in these strange clothes. I also spent a lot of money on large cars, but now things have changed. I don't drive often now, unless I suddenly think of getting away from the crowd. Then, in the middle of the night, at two or three o'clock, I would jump into the car and drive silently for a while, until the thought of getting away from the crowd disappeared, and then I would stop the car.

I also supported my sister Fanice to finish high school and university. She now teaches English in Detroit and has a master's degree in history. Fanice is very smart, and I am very proud of her. Also, I bought many houses for my brothers and sisters in Detroit. I also bought an entire apartment building in Chicago with Mave, and the rent from this apartment is quite considerable.

But I also lost money in business. For example, I took over a coffee shop in Chicago and lost 40,000 yuan. A wine shop I ran in East Detroit also lost 25,000 yuan.

When the American draft came, I registered in Chicago. Some people said that I could find someone to replace me, but I didn't want to receive any special privileges. I just wanted to be an American soldier. I volunteered for military service, and they sent me to Fort Riley in Kansas. I received basic training like everyone else. I stayed there until the Department of the Army sent me on a boxing tour. But this was also the beginning of sad things for me. When I was a child in Alabama, I didn't know what racial discrimination was. But I never went to places where there was racial discrimination. In all my boxing matches, I always tried to avoid this trouble. In the army, I remained the same, because I thought I was an American, fighting for the country like other American soldiers. I also thought that if I was fighting for human freedom and equality, then I would stick to this goal to the end.

But once, at Camp Sibert in Alabama, I accidentally stepped into a bus station to call for a taxi. I sat down on a bench in the front row of the station, and a military policeman came over and told me that I should sit on the bench in the back row, "The back bench is reserved for people of color." Of course I didn't want to go. Robinson, a middleweight boxer who was also black, was also present and supported my opinion. The military policeman asked the supervisor to come and took us to a camp, where the army captain lectured us. He said, "When a military policeman tells you to do something, you only have to obey, otherwise, you will only be asking for trouble." I said, "Sir, I am a soldier, the same as any other American soldier. I don't want to be pushed to the back row because I am black."

The case was later transferred to the Inspector General of the Army in Washington. As a result, an order was issued to abolish the original seating discrimination regulations on public buses in the military. But outside the military, I still obeyed the original US regulations on racial discrimination. But in the military, everyone is fighting for one goal, so there is no need for that set of old rules. (To be continued)

### Basketball League Tonight: Renyu Faces Haiqing for the First Time, Women's Division A-1: Green Team and Hualian Rank First

[Report from this newspaper] Tonight's basketball league features three Division A games. The main match in Division A-1 is Renyu vs. Haiqing. The two teams are meeting for the first time. In the first round, Haiqing requested a postponement due to an event, and the makeup game has not yet been scheduled. Renyu's youth team has been performing very well recently, making rapid progress, and is considered by many to be one of the most promising teams besides Hualian. Haiqing is represented by a member of the recently arrived US Navy ship Springfield basketball team and has considerable strength, including three black players who are quite formidable. Renyu must work together to win, which will be another exciting game. Tickets for the City Stadium are as usual, with the schedule as follows:

Police Machinery - Wuming (Division A-2B) 5:30 PM

Red Riders - Pushui (Division A-2D) 6:30 PM

In the standings, the Green Team has won all five games, remaining undefeated and taking the top spot. The Li Team is closely following with four wins in five games. The championship will likely be contested by these two teams. The Green Team has a stronger chance.

However, if the losers' bracket champion has been directly defeated by the losing team in the regular finals in the regular season, it will lose the qualification to compete for the overall runner-up, and the losing team in the finals will be directly named the runner-up. This is a resolution of the conference of representatives of each European team in the competition. The organizing committee of the cup competition announced: "In order to comply with the resolution of the conference of representatives, the ticket price for both the Shanghai vs. Firefly game tomorrow and the Daxia vs. Wanli game the day after tomorrow will be 300 yuan. We hope that the responsible persons of the four teams will submit the official starting lineups for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow to the sports stadium before 5:00 PM today."

### Chen Zhennan Ranks Fifth in Philippine 1500 Meter Swimming Race

[Hong Kong Air News] Chen Zhennan, Hong Kong's long-distance swimming champion who went to the Philippines alone, competed for the first time at the Rizal National Swimming Pool in Manila on Saturday evening (5th).

The event that evening was 1,500 meters. In addition to Philippine swimming experts, there were also many European and American "water monsters" participating, creating a rare and great international swimming competition in the Far East.

A total of nine athletes participated in the final that evening. After the gun fired, "Fat Nan" was slightly slow to enter the water. After 200 meters, Chen strove to catch up, gradually catching up, and at 250 meters, he was shoulder to shoulder with the Philippine long-distance swimming star "Mabas," only slightly behind. But before them, there were still several European and American "water monsters" and "water snakes."

After 29 pool lengths, everyone exerted their strength forward in the last 50 meters, vying for the lead. Chen Zhennan ranked fifth among the nine international stars. Mabash, who won the 880-yard championship in the Hong Kong-Philippine intercity swimming competition, ranked third.

The record for first place was 21 minutes, 35.7 seconds, which was several minutes faster than Chen Zhennan's 23 minutes, 2 seconds and 3 tenths in the Seventh National Games. However, according to Liu Dibing, who accompanied Chen in training in Hong Kong, "Chen once set an excellent record of 21 minutes, 22 seconds and 8 tenths in Hong Kong. However, this was the time made in a short 20-meter swimming pool, and it cannot be used as a standard."

It is understood that this Philippine International Swimming Competition is based on the World Games amateur swimming rules, and each competition records six names. Thus, "Fat Nan's" fifth place is still selected and he receives two points, so that he will not "carry an empty egg" back.

At 8:00 PM on the 6th, Zhennan will still participate in his second competition at the Rizal Swimming Pool. The event is 400 meters. In general, it is believed that Chen has sufficient endurance and is more confident in the 1500 meters than the 400 meters, so this item may be more difficult to win. However, before the trip, his coaches, the Huang Shaochi and Shaoxiong brothers, had already given him tips, telling him that in the 400-meter race, he must try his best to take the lead, because "Fat Nan's" stamina is formidable, but the distance is insufficient. If he can seize the lead, it will not be difficult to achieve better results.

During the competition, the competition was very fierce, with the distance between each person only a palm's width or half a body's difference. A large number of overseas Chinese cheered for Chen Zhennan, so although Chen competed alone in Manila, he did not feel lonely.

After two nights of competition in the Philippines, Chen will visit the Manila Chinese Youth Association, the Guangdong Guildhall, the Embassy, the Consulate, etc., and will be entertained by local overseas Chinese leaders. It is expected that he will return to Hong Kong on the 9th of this month by Philippine Airlines passenger plane.

### Hong Kong Island Football News

[Hong Kong Air News] In Hong Kong last weekend, football matches were very lively. In the Division A competition, the overlord South China defeated the Army 4-0. Due to an incomplete lineup, China only managed a 2-2 draw with the police. In the match between Bus and Eastern, Eastern lost 4-1. South China and the Navy drew 1-1. Kitchee and Kwong Wah fought one-sidedly, with Kitchee winning by four goals. The Air Force won 3-2 against St. Joseph's.

### Sports World: South China Sends Army Four Eggs

After South China sent the Army four eggs, according to the current situation, they still occupy the first place with a record of 13 wins, 5 draws, and 2 losses in 20 matches.

South China

Yu Yaode

Zhang Shuling Hou Rongsheng

Liu Songsheng Xie Jinhong Zhang Jinhai

Xie Jinhe Li Zhaorong Zhu Yongqiang Tian Xiebo Feng Jingxiang

Army Team

Ansersen

Nasu Robinson

Linsky Kelekick Kemin

Bunn Massding Knott Westh Brown

Looking at the above lineup, although the Army failed to fight with all its strength, the two substitutes were able to work hard. On the large field, although the attacking power was not as sharp as on the small field, when they mustered their strength, they were still able to pose a considerable threat to South China. The defense was also not weak. Therefore, even a strong team like South China was only able to win by one goal in the first half. In the second half, if Nasu and Kelekick had not lost their temper and lost their rationality, and if the South China players had not been able to use the large field to disperse their concentrated strength and take advantage of it, it would have been difficult to win by so many goals.

### Mayor's Cup Football Final on Sunday

[Report from this newspaper] The semi-finals of the 3rd Mayor's Cup Football Tournament ended last week. China Airlines unexpectedly eliminated Qingbai, which had held the championship for two years, while the Railway team smoothly defeated Zhichao. China Airlines and the Railway team both qualified for the finals. The two teams are scheduled to compete for the championship at Yiyuan this Sunday afternoon at 3:00 PM. This year's Mayor's Cup has ushered in a new situation. Qingbai's monopoly has been broken. Both the Railway and China Airlines are very excited. At that time, the final battle will definitely be fought with all their strength to compete, which will be a tense situation. On the same day, Sunday morning at 10:00 AM, Yingguang and Pan Team will hold a youth cup semi-final at Yiyuan.

### China Almost Lost Two Points

Several key players of the China team were absent, and most were replaced by players from the B team. At the beginning of the game, they had to put together a team with great difficulty, causing the game to be delayed for several minutes. The starting lineup was as follows: Yu Qi'en

Yu Qi'en

Ke Ju

Chen Qingquan Xu Canrong Yu Huasheng Zhang Zhanxin Guo Zhuochang

In contrast, the police team had added a new general, who had just transferred from Eastern, namely the "handsome guy" Yuan Yulin. With a strong lineup, fans generally believed that China would have more bad luck than good. Fortunately, the police goalkeeper "Black Boy" A Bashi played Zhuge Kongming yesterday, often displaying the empty city strategy, but "Mad Horse" Lu Huasheng did not play Sima Zhongda, getting a good opportunity to equalize, otherwise China would have lost two points without a doubt. Let's first look at the police's lineup: A Bashi

He Cheng Feng Beizan

Liu Rongguang Hou Lu Li Wei

Ge Lasu Yuan Yaolin Lie Min Zeng Xikang Wu Ruwei

Looking at the strength of the two teams, the police should be stronger than China, but in the first half, the entire police line was like scattered sand. Not only was the offensive weak, but the defense was also not as desired, allowing China to score a goal first. In the second half, the police gradually got on track and scored two goals in one breath. If "Black Boy" A Bashi had not missed the last one, allowing Huasheng to take advantage of the opportunity to score, this draw would not have been possible. It can be said that China was lucky in misfortune.

### Clear Disparity in Strength Between Bus and Eastern

Bus easily defeated Eastern 4-1. The two old generals in Eastern's defense can be said to be Huang Zhong and Yan Yan, but they have passed the time of conquering Dingjun Mountain. Liu Yiqiang is Liu Qingcai's "son." Looking at the lineup, one can see the disparity in strength at a glance. Fortunately, Eastern's interest in playing football is not bad.

The eleven players of Bus are:

Tan Jun'gan

Yi Zhenhui Mai Linfu

Feng Kunsheng Kong Qingyu Deng Sen

Li Dahui Zou Wenzhi Deng Yijie Li Chunfa Qian Chifen

Eastern's lineup is:

Yang Bin

Bei De Jiang Shanjing

Liu Yiqiang Li Dianqi Li Qiguang

Huang Baixiong Liu Fuquan Li Huilin Deng Guangquan Li Hongqi

### Kitchee Defeats Kwong Wah 4-0

Kwong Wah played poorly, often being teased by Kitchee in the palm of their hand. Tan Huanzhuo was not as good as in the previous two games. Kitchee attacked more and defended less. In the first half, they first presented two goose eggs, and then sent two more in the second half. Although Kwong Wah's forwards tried their best to break the eggshell, they always failed to break through Zhu Bangban's final barrier. Even a rare penalty kick was given to Liang Baiwei to host a banquet at the Tin Hau Temple, which was too disappointing. Kwong Wah's defeat was expected, but the biggest reason was the slow and sluggish play. The final kick was always snatched away while hesitating, otherwise they could have scored one or two goals.

Kitchee Team

Zhu Zhaohang

Mo Jinsong Huo Yaohua

Luo Weiquan You Huaxing Li Bingzhao

Huang Jingting Zhang Songgen Zhao Fu Guo Yingqi Yao Zhuoran

### On the Benefit Without Harm of Pricing in Customs Gold Units

— Martin

Since our city's public utilities, "in coordination with financial and economic reforms," implemented the most scientific and rational Customs Gold Unit pricing method in Shanghai's history, it is expected that prices will soon fall, and the world will be in great order. The people should warmly welcome and wholeheartedly support this. However, I have recently read in various newspapers that there are many criticisms of the Customs Gold Unit pricing. Whether these people are illegal elements intentionally plotting to sabotage this most scientific and rational method is unknown and will be set aside for now. However, according to my detailed research, there are at least five benefits to pricing public utilities in Customs Gold Units, and there are almost no drawbacks. How do I know this? Listen to what I say:

(1) Since the Customs Gold Unit for pricing is adjusted daily and even hourly, in other words, the Gold Yuan is depreciating daily and even hourly in a "formally listed" manner. The common people will inevitably be greatly panicked and eager to spend the Gold Yuan, which is becoming less valuable by the minute. Those who receive Gold Yuan in the morning will spend it in the afternoon; those who receive it in the afternoon will spend it in the evening. In this way, the Gold Yuan issued by the Central Bank will not be hidden in boxes by the people. Since the Gold Yuan is no longer hidden in boxes, there will be plenty of Gold Yuan on the market, and the Central Bank will not need to issue large amounts of currency to "alleviate the shortage of cash." In this way, the issuance by the National Treasury will naturally stop, which is the first benefit.

(2) Because tram tickets need to be adjusted daily, the price is no longer printed on them. Upon investigation, Shanghai's trams have always been free of embezzlement, especially Route 1, which is particularly strict and dedicated to public service. From now on, with the price not printed on tickets, embezzlement will disappear even more, because the ticket sellers deeply fear that there is a divine presence watching them, and they are afraid that with the price not printed, they will not be able to face the heavens, so they will resolve never to embezzle. This measure will not only greatly increase the company's income but also greatly help Shanghai society's ethical concepts, which is the second benefit.

(3) Electricity, tap water, and gas are priced in Customs Gold Units, rising daily and increasing greatly at night. Users will inevitably be frightened and dare not use too much, to avoid bankruptcy. Those who originally ate three meals a day will change to two meals; those who originally drank boiled water will change to cold water; those who originally took a bath once a week will change to once a year. In this way, the conservation movement can be thoroughly promoted among the people without the advocacy of officials, and the conservation of materials will be clearly visible, which is the third benefit.

(4) After Customs Gold Unit pricing, the most unbearable are factories. Factories cannot afford electricity, so they have to reduce operating hours or close down one after another. Conversely, they will use less raw materials, which can save the country a lot of foreign exchange, and the prices of goods on the market will also fall sharply due to the factories stopping purchasing, thereby stabilizing prices, which is the fourth benefit.

(5) Since public utilities collect Customs Gold Units but still pay workers based on the cost of living index, they can obtain countless profits, and everyone will be happy. Moreover, the standard has been set, so there is no need to constantly pester the Public Utilities Bureau. The Public Utilities Bureau, which has always been dizzy from the word "adjustment," can now simplify its administration and enjoy peace and prosperity, truly implementing the so-called "arriving at the office with eight parts diligence and nine parts scheming, brewing tea at half past ten, reading the newspaper at eleven, and leaving work at twelve." This is the fifth benefit.

With these five points, it is clear that pricing public utilities in Customs Gold Units has a hundred benefits and no drawbacks. However, there is one point that I would like to suggest for improvement, which is that the pricing unit for public utilities is only equal to 0.625 Customs Gold Units, which is too little. It is best to "adjust" it to 2.625 or 3.625. In this way, public utilities can further increase their income and profits by millions, and foreign merchants will laugh heartily—this will naturally be of great benefit to promoting friendly relations.

### Men Look at Women

— Dongfang Jing

The "Women's Family Magazine" some time ago solicited the opinions of some famous men, asking them what they first noticed when they first saw a woman. The answers of these famous men each had different mysteries. Here are a few excerpts to express the vision of men.

Robert Taylor: "I pay attention to her walk. I hate a woman who walks with difficulty, as if she is about to fall; or walks too fast, like a race walker. Before you see her face, you can know a lot about this woman just by looking at the way she walks."

Bing Crosby: "For a woman, the first thing I notice is her eyes. If they are sparkling, it proves that she has a sense of humor and is a good companion."

Henry Link: "I look at women in two ways, one is to look at her during the day, and the other is to look at her personality. In restaurants, on the streets, or in other public places, I look at women with the attitude of appreciating pictures. In social gatherings, I look at their hurtful personalities. And personality is the ability of a person to interest others, the various habits of serving others. What a woman does to others can express her personality more than what she does to herself."

McLaren: "I pay attention to hands. Not the way the hands look, but how women use their hands."

### Small Matters of the World

In the sea near the Malay Peninsula, there is a kind of large clam that is five feet wide and weighs hundreds of pounds each. This kind of large clam can eat people, and if a child falls into its shell, they will not survive. In the Saint Sulpice Church in Paris, there is a shell of this kind of large clam, which is used as a basin for holy water.

There is a lake in South Africa with peculiar water quality. If ironware is put into the lake and taken out after years, not only will it not rust, but it will also be shiny and bright, like newly cast.

The distant ancestors of human beings were a kind of dog-shaped reptiles. In the Karoo Desert in South Africa, fossils from 200 million years ago were excavated, which were dog-shaped reptiles. It is said that there are only two places in the world where such fossils have been discovered.

Soviet explorer Korshnikov, while exploring in Siberia, picked up a gold ingot in the wilderness, weighing more than 14 and a half catties. It is still unknown who left it behind.

### The Origin of International Women's Day

— Baozhu

It has been exactly forty years since International Women's Day was created. Forty years ago—in 1910, due to the call of Ms. Clara Zetkin, a women's conference was held in the capital of Denmark, and March 8 was designated as International Women's Day. From that year on, it became an annual festival for women all over the world.

Ms. Clara Zetkin was the founder of the modern women's movement. She was German, and after graduating from a normal school, she became an elementary school teacher. At that time, due to the results of the industrial revolution, capitalism gradually matured, and labor-capital disputes also occurred, and the idea of socialism also sprouted. At that time, she met many people who had fled from Poland and Tsarist Russia to Germany, which changed her thinking and led her to join the Social Democratic Party. Later, in order to prevent the spread of social ideas, the German government promulgated the "Anti-Socialist Law," and Ms. Clara was also expelled from the country.

Clara left Germany and lived in Switzerland with a Russian man, Vossip Zetkin. Later, they moved to Paris and lived an exiled life. Vossip was also a teacher, and he became seriously ill during several years of exile. At that time, she already had two children. For the sake of her husband and children, she went out to teach while also writing articles to maintain her life. During these years, Ms. Clara suffered all kinds of hardships in life and also encountered the pain of exile, which made her a strong sympathizer of the oppressed and determined to fight for the oppressed.

In 1899, Vossip's illness became more and more serious and he died. Fortunately, at that time, the German "Anti-Socialist Law" was abolished, and Clara took her two children back to the country. After returning to Germany, she founded the "Equal Women's Magazine," dedicated to fighting for oppressed women. She advocated the women's movement and created women's welfare. This work lasted for thirteen years. Later, she founded the "International Magazine," which made the women's movement more internationalized. In 1907, the first international socialist women's conference was held, and the international socialist secretariat was established, which made the women's movement more concrete. Three years later, in 1910, at the second international socialist women's conference, it was decided that March 8 would be International Women's Day.

Why was March 8 chosen as Women's Day? When the European women's movement was booming, women in the New World, in order to fight for equality between men and women, gathered thousands of people to hold a demonstration and parade. At first, only women from Chicago participated, but later women from all over the United States rose up in response. It was the largest project in the women's movement and attracted the attention of various countries. This happened on March 8, 1909, so when the second international socialist women's conference was held the following year, March 8 was designated as International Women's Day. International Women's Day was born from this.

### On Automatic Adjustment

— Yu Qiang

"Adjustment" has long become a polite synonym for price increase. Although it also implies the possibility of a price decrease, unfortunately, it is only a possibility. Since the words "adjust price" have been used together, there has always been an increase without a decrease.

Now, "automatic adjustment" is even more popular. From the trend of prices, it means that prices will be raised at any time and will no longer be "passive." In the past, general prices have always been automatically adjusted at any time, only slightly restricted during the price control period. The prices of "passively adjusted" were only limited to a few public utilities, but now they are all "liberated" and have changed from "passive" to "automatic." ——The only thing that probably remains trapped in the "passive" circle is "salary."

The leading "automatic hero" among public utilities is the postal and telecommunications industry, which was previously praised by the common people for its slow pace of price adjustment. Subsequently, the public utilities of this city emerged, and a "pricing unit" was set, nominally based on the Customs Gold Unit, and indirectly based on the US dollar. From then on, there was the danger of owing money for sending letters and the embarrassment of not bringing enough money to take the tram.

From the fact that it no longer needs to be approved by the competent authorities, the price of public utilities is automatically adjusted. However, from the way the adjusted price is generated, it is still passive. For example, the price of postal and telecommunications fees is calculated based on rice, paper, and gasoline. The price of these things, which are considered calculation standards, is adjusted, and the postal and telecommunications fees follow suit. If we analyze it further thoroughly, rice shops and paper shops also have their own cost calculation formulas. If the cost rises, their goods will follow suit. If we pursue it in this way, the culprit of "automatic adjustment" may be something other than the price itself.

However, no matter who the culprit that promotes the automatic adjustment of prices is, the behavior of various prices keeping up with each other over the past ten years is like a marathon without an end. Everyone is afraid of falling behind. From the perspective of a single price itself, this is "automatic adjustment"—do not fall behind other prices.

Let's go back and look at the salary class, which is coldly abandoned in the "passive" circle. They use a salary that is more than 300 times higher to cope with living expenses that have been verified to be more than 600 times higher; now they use a salary that is more than 600 times higher to cope with living expenses that have risen by an unknown amount. I wonder when they will be liberated and join the "automatic" marathon?

### Shanghai Old Tales, Part Three: Casual Talk About the Temple of the Queen of Heaven

— Gu Qi

The Temple of the Queen of Heaven at the foot of the Henan Road Bridge is generally called the Temple of the Heavenly Concubine by people, and it is a place that everyone in Shanghai knows. But what people don't know is that the Temple of the Queen of Heaven has undergone many changes over the centuries.

The earliest Temple of the Queen of Heaven was not at the foot of the Henan Road Bridge, but was built outside the Little East Gate. According to research, it was in the third year of Yuanshuo of the Song Dynasty, that is, 1100 AD, which is 850 years ago from now. The Queen of Heaven is originally a god who protects navigation, so boatmen on the sea are very pious and respectful to the Queen of Heaven. Many old-fashioned seagoing vessels have a shrine behind the helmsman, which enshrines the Queen of Heaven, and incense is burned all year round. It is said that when a ship encounters strong winds and huge waves in the river and sea, and is about to be in danger, as long as it prays for the protection of the Queen of Heaven, it can turn bad luck into good luck and have a safe journey. From this, it can also be seen that the Queen of Heaven has a close relationship with navigation. Several important coastal commercial ports, such as Ningbo and Fuzhou, have temples of the Queen of Heaven built, and they are all built very solemnly and grandly.

In the third year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty, that is, 1853 AD, the Taiping Rebellion occurred, and the Temple of the Queen of Heaven was also burned to the ground in the war. After the war subsided, the Min-Guang shipping merchants raised funds to rebuild it on the original site. However, not long after it was built, it was burned down for the second time due to the Little Dagger Society Rebellion. It turned out that several leaders of the Little Dagger Society at that time used the Temple of the Queen of Heaven as a place for hiding and contacting each other. The Qing government went to capture them, but found nothing, so they burned the Temple of the Queen of Heaven, which was considered a plan to eradicate the nest. For the next twenty years, the Temple of the Queen of Heaven was not rebuilt.

In the tenth year of Guangxu, that is, 1884, it was re-surveyed and rebuilt with donations at the north foot of the Railway Road Bridge in the Public Concession, which is the current Temple of the Queen of Heaven. The so-called Railway Road Bridge is not because the road is paved with iron, but because the earliest bridges built on the Suzhou River during the Public Concession used iron bars as the skeleton and wooden boards on top, which was this bridge, so people called it the Railway Road Bridge. Since the Temple of the Queen of Heaven was built, it has been called the Queen of Heaven Temple Bridge. The current name is Henan Road Bridge. But now, most people call it the Heavenly Concubine Temple Bridge. Who first demoted the grand "Queen" to "Concubine" is unknown.
