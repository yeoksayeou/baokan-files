### Government Peace Talk Representatives Determined; Immediate Consultation to Discuss Peace Talk Procedures; Hoping the CCP Will Also Quickly Send Representatives; Opinions on Location and Date to Be Provided Promptly

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] The Executive Yuan has, on the 24th, appointed peace representatives and urged the CCP to immediately send representatives to begin peace talks. Of the five government representatives, Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, and Li Zheng are all in Nanjing; Huang Shaohong can fly to Nanjing from Hong Kong immediately; and Zhang Shizhao is also scheduled to arrive in Nanjing on the night train of the 24th. Afterwards, they will, under the joint deliberation of Acting President Li and Premier He, prepare the basis and steps for peace talks, collect various data, and prepare to begin peace talks. Before the adjournment of the Executive Yuan meeting, the spokesperson first announced to reporters: "The government deeply feels that the early realization of peace is the most urgent requirement of the people of the whole country. Therefore, Premier He, at the beginning of his duties today, convened an Executive Yuan meeting to discuss various issues related to promoting peace. It was resolved to appoint Mr. Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Huang Shaohong, Zhang Shizhao, and Li Zheng as government peace talk representatives. It is hoped that the CCP will also quickly appoint representatives and propose opinions on the location of the peace talks and the date of the start of the peace talks, in order to facilitate the peace talks and appease the desires of the people of the whole country."

Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Huang Shaohong, Zhang Shizhao, Li Zheng

[Our Newspaper] After the government's peace talk representatives were approved by the Executive Yuan meeting, an important consultation will be held in Nanjing at 9:00 a.m. on the 25th to discuss the order of the peace talks. Mr. Zhang Shizhao, who was staying in Shanghai, received a notice from Premier He yesterday and went to Nanjing by night train to attend the meeting. After the meeting, he will return to Shanghai and wait for the decision of the delegation's departure date before going to the designated location to meet and set off. Before leaving Shanghai, Mr. Zhang said: "Premier He's invitation to non-Party members to serve as peace talk representatives shows the magnanimity of the Kuomintang, which is deeply admirable. I firmly believe that seeking peace with this fair attitude has a great hope of success. I am willing to take this good opportunity to serve the people of the whole country and do my best to mediate between the KMT and CCP representatives, so that the peace talks can be successful." The location of the peace talks has not yet been decided. During the previous negotiations in Peiping, the CCP representatives mentioned three places: Beiping, Qingdao, and Shijiazhuang. After the government's peace talk representatives gather in Nanjing, they will consult with the CCP on the location and procedures of the peace talks before making a decision. It is expected that the departure can be made within ten days. When asked by reporters whether third-party figures will participate in the peace talks, Mr. Zhang said: "This is a direct consultation between the KMT and the CCP. Other parties and public representatives will not participate. If peace can be achieved, it is possible to reopen political consultations including other factions." Mr. Zhang emphasized that both sides have sincerity in this peace talk. Although the CCP has military actions in Jiangbei, it is also a nature of preparing for war and seeking peace, which is no different from Jiangnan. During the peace talks, he personally believes that the Communist army will not cross the river, because such a move would greatly affect the CCP's credibility. Regarding the content of the CCP's demands revealed by Deputy Director Wu Tiecheng in Guangzhou, Mr. Zhang did not provide responsible confirmation, but said that it was mentioned, but it was quite general.

### Four Major Policies of the He Cabinet: Striving for Peace, Innovating Military and Politics, Stabilizing People's Livelihood and Expecting Economic Socialism

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] He Yingqin, the premier of the cabinet, and ten cabinet members who had already arrived in Nanjing, took office and commenced their duties at the Presidential Palace at 10:00 a.m. this morning, and immediately held their first Executive Yuan meeting. Those in attendance included He Yingqin, Jia Jingde, Zhang Zhizhong, He Yaozu, Li Hanhun, Sun Yueqi, Xu Yongchang, Liu Gongyun, Duanmu Jie, Zhang Zhiben, Bai Yunti, and Chuan Bingchang (Ye Gongchao substituting). Those present in an observer capacity included Gu Zhutong, Huang Shaoju, Pang Songzhou, and Ni Jiongcheng. The meeting began at 10:30 a.m. First, Premier He invited the Acting President to say a few words. Li briefly explained his expectations for the new cabinet and hoped that the new cabinet could unite and work hard to achieve the goal of seeking peace. Li then withdrew. Then the formal meeting began. He immediately delivered a speech, announcing the cabinet's four major goals for the current period. Subsequently, Foreign Affairs Vice Minister Ye Gongchao, Minister of National Defense Xu Yongchang, and Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong reported on foreign affairs and military affairs, respectively. At the end of the meeting, the following cases were discussed: (1) The appointment of peace talk representatives: Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Huang Shaohong, Zhang Shizhao, and Li Zheng were appointed. At the same time, it was hoped that the CCP would quickly send representatives to explain the time and location of the peace talks, so that they could proceed quickly. (2) Drafting of policy guidelines: Based on the four goals proposed by He on the 24th: striving for peace, reforming the military, reforming politics, and stabilizing people's livelihood, and referring to the policies of the previous cabinet led by Sun Ke, taking the strengths and discarding the weaknesses, the heads of each ministry and commission were instructed to provide opinions. A temporary Executive Yuan meeting will be convened on the 28th to gather and discuss the opinions, and a concrete plan will be drafted and reported to the Legislative Yuan on the 30th. (3) Draft Organic Law of the Ministry of Economic Affairs: First, the Ministry of Economic Affairs was instructed to trial it, and then submit it to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. The organization of the draft law is that the Ministry of Economic Affairs would set up two directorates: Industry and Commerce, Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy, as well as the Resources Committee and three departments: General Affairs, etc. (4) Reorganization of the Anhui Provincial Government. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 p.m., and a photo was taken for commemoration.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] He Yingqin said in his speech at the first Executive Yuan meeting on the 24th: "I have repeatedly declined the appointment of President of the Executive Yuan, but I have not been allowed to do so. I can only try my best to live up to the important trust. However, at this difficult time, I rely on everyone's efforts to overcome difficulties together. The new cabinet has already been formed, and I am deeply grateful and appreciative to all gentlemen for their willingness to participate and take on arduous tasks. I have always been in charge of military affairs and have rarely asked about politics. However, observing the current situation, the government's primary goals are fourfold: (1) Striving for peace. Years of war and flames are everywhere, and the people's suffering has reached its extreme. Therefore, seeking peace should be the unanimous wish of the people of the whole country. I believe that only by broadening our horizons and maintaining the greatest tolerance and sincerity can we achieve peace at an early date. (2) Reforming the military. In order to rectify military discipline and reduce the burden on the people, we must first reform the military. In the past, the number of National Army quotas was not completely accurate, and military discipline was not completely rectified. We should actively rectify, verify, and reorganize them, and improve the conscription system and the treatment of palace soldiers, so as to ensure that the military quota is not false, military discipline is strict, and a strong national defense force is truly formed. (3) Reforming politics. If we want to rise up, revitalize our abuses, and reverse the atmosphere, there is no other way to follow except to reform politics. Such things as simplifying administrative agencies at all levels, improving administrative efficiency, cutting redundant staff, eradicating corruption, implementing local autonomy, and strengthening democratic constitutionalism are all important things that we should properly plan and actively implement, wash away the old dirt, and start anew with the people. (4) Stabilizing the people's livelihood. Today, the country's finances and finance have been exhausted, and the national economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. It is urgent to correct the source and make repairs to remedy the situation. In terms of symptomatic treatment, we must reform the military, cut agencies, and tighten all unnecessary expenditures to reduce their outflow, rectify taxation, prohibit floating abuses, levy property taxes to unblock their source, raise funds widely, contract currency, and maintain currency confidence. In terms of radical cure, we must implement planned economy, strive for public-private balance, national wealth, reorganize state-owned enterprises, strictly prohibit competing with the people for profit, reward private enterprises, and prosper industry and commerce, so as to achieve economic socialization and the people's livelihood will become increasingly stable. The above-mentioned points have either been clearly instructed by the Acting President or have been discussed and studied by the members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans. They are all urgent matters. I deeply feel that the burden is heavy, and I will do my best to serve with loyalty and sincerity. I hope that all gentlemen will cooperate and assist more, so that the above-mentioned points can be realized one by one. This is not only my sincere prayer."

### Communist Forces in Jiangbei Gradually Increase Pressure; Fierce Fighting Breaks Out on the Outskirts of Anqing; Lin Biao's Troops Have Reached Bengbu

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] After completing the reorganization, the Communist forces in Jiangbei have now officially begun to gradually increase pressure on the National Army's bridgehead positions. Among them, from the border of Hubei and Anhui, Yuxikou (opposite Wuhu), Jiangpu, and the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, and Dahekou (southeast of Liuhe) continue to remain calm. There are still minor contacts in Yizheng, Shierxu, Guazhou, and Shijiaqiao. In Kouan (south of Taixian), Qianshan, Taihu, and Wangjiang, etc., limited by terrain, the outposts were automatically abandoned on the 21st.

### Editorial: A Plea from the Industrial Sector

The Municipal Industrial Association telegraphed President He on the 23rd, lamenting the crisis in the industrial sector and offering four suggestions regarding the government's current industrial policies: (1) Reinstate separate listings for overseas remittances and foreign exchange transfer certificates, and maintain the import-export linkage system; (2) Effectively suppress usurious interest rates; (3) Abolish the practice of collecting commodity taxes in kind; and (4) Strictly control imports and exports. At a time when national industrial production is in a state of stagnation, the government authorities should have already been seeking ways to remedy the situation and gradually revitalize it from its sluggish state. Now that the Municipal Industrial Association has put forward four suggestions, the government authorities should pay special attention and immediately adopt them. Leaving aside the principles and theories of economics, these four suggestions, in reality, are not only the lifeline of national industrial production but also the key to rescuing the national economic crisis.

The crisis faced by such productive enterprises is not unique to government-controlled areas; the communist areas are also feeling it. At the conclusion of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China (CPC) held in Shijiazhuang, a warning was issued to CPC members, stating that the central work of the CPC has shifted from rural areas to cities. If the production work in cities cannot be restored and developed, then the Communist Party will not be able to stand firm and will inevitably fail. This further clarifies the importance of urban production work. If the financial and economic policies planned by our government disregard the urgent appeals of the industrial sector and cause production to suffer, then the government will inevitably face a fate of failure. Today, the government should strive to compete with the CPC in supporting industrial production.

We believe that the reasons for the current stagnation of general industrial production, in addition to the unstable overall environment of the political situation, include the following factors:

First, production costs are too high. Because most of the raw materials required by our country's industries are imported from abroad, and the prices of foreign exchange transfers have recently soared, production costs have also increased accordingly. Anyone who pays attention to market conditions knows the situation of rising foreign exchange certificate prices. On December 12th of last year, the foreign exchange certificate was priced at 25 gold yuan per US dollar, and by January 26th of this year, it had risen to 170 yuan, an increase of seven times in seventy days, a relatively moderate increase. However, by March 16th, it had soared to 6,875 yuan, an increase of forty times in fifty days. This kind of surge is really too alarming! Moreover, since March 16th, the surge has not stopped. The price on the 17th was 7,425 yuan, on the 18th it was 8,500 yuan, on the 19th it was 8,675 yuan, on the 21st it was 9,835 yuan, on the 22nd it was 10,250 yuan, on the 23rd it was 10,700 yuan, and yesterday it even rose to 11,500 yuan. From these statistics, it can be seen that the price of foreign exchange certificates is rising faster than any commodity price, and there is indeed a deliberate intention to lead the rise in prices. In other words, raw materials are rising faster, far exceeding the increase in finished products. Normally, there is a saying that "when the water rises, the boat rises," and industrial production is not afraid of rising raw material costs. However, in today's situation, due to the special objective environment, such as shrinking sales areas and reduced purchasing power, the boat has risen, but it has not been able to elevate. Who would be willing to do this kind of loss-making business? Therefore, factories that have already been established have had to reduce or suspend production in order to reduce losses, and newly established factories that have not yet started operations have had to stop halfway and temporarily adopt a wait-and-see attitude.

Second, sales of finished products are sluggish. Under the current circumstances, apart from the daily necessities of food, clothing, housing, and transportation, the sales of all other finished products are very weak. On the one hand, the rapid inflation of the gold yuan has drastically reduced the purchasing power of the general public to a very small extent. Apart from the necessities of daily life, which they have to buy, they have no money to buy other finished products. On the other hand, due to the uncertainty of the situation, whether it will be peace or war, even those who can afford to buy goods stop at the sight of them. In addition, the "gambling trend" is promoted by the authorities, and everyone is turning to financial commodities. Gold, silver, and foreign currencies have become the targets of those with purchasing power. Therefore, financial commodities are rising every day, and only food is also rising along with them. Other general commodities cannot follow suit and lag behind; otherwise, no one will be interested. Indeed, in a period of inflation, the sluggish sales of finished products are not enough to abuse industry and commerce; they may even be beneficial to industry and commerce. However, under today's high-interest rate situation, everything is completely different. The official interest rate for bank loans is 60 yuan per day, and the interest rate on the black market sometimes exceeds 100 yuan per day. Therefore, calculated with daily compound interest, the interest on a loan of one yuan is six cents per day, and the total principal and interest in one month amount to six times. If this remains unchanged for a long time, the total for twelve months of the year can reach over 21 billion times! This situation is making it difficult for factories to advance or retreat. If they want to calculate costs and refuse to sell at low prices, borrowing money to survive, they will not be able to bear the burden of high-interest rates. Conversely, if they painfully cut prices and sell off, then the income they receive will definitely not be enough for reproduction. We said before that 80 to 90 percent of the factories in Shanghai in December and January may have to declare "closed for good." Now it seems that they may not even have to wait until after December and January!

In short, the suggestions made by the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Association to the government are the urgent priorities for the government to save the crisis of industry and commerce. Especially in the current situation where industry is in a predicament of "wanting to live but not being able to live, wanting to die but not being able to die," it cannot be taken lightly. Industry is the lifeline of national survival. If industry goes bankrupt, what else is there to talk about national economy and people's livelihood! We earnestly hope that the He Cabinet will understand public opinion and quickly decide on countermeasures to save industry.

### US Aid Gains New Momentum: US Government Notifies China to Prepare a Formal Plan; Government Designates Personnel to Draft Short-Term Plan for Completion

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] US aid funds have recently made new progress. The US government has notified our country to immediately prepare a formal plan to be sent to the US for reference and for use during Congressional discussions. It is reported that the government has designated personnel to draft the plan starting today, and it is expected to be completed in the short term and sent to the United States. Foreign Vice Minister Yeh Kung-chao mentioned this matter briefly during the political affairs meeting on the 24th.

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Secretary of State Acheson declared today that, regarding aid to China, the US government currently supports limiting it to the remaining funds under the existing legislation, and hopes that Congress will approve the proposal by Representative Judd, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, to allow the use of these remaining funds until June 30th. The current aid to China legislation expires on April 3rd. Apart from this, the US government cannot consider a more far-reaching aid to China plan for the time being.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] Representative Judd introduced a bill in Congress today advocating that the current economic aid to China plan be extended from April 3rd to June 30th, but with no new appropriations. The only difference between Mr. Judd's bill and Mr. Chi's bill is the length of the extension. Mr. Judd told a Central News Agency reporter that Mr. Chi's bill advocates extending the plan to the end of the year, while he advocates extending it for ninety days because the US government and Congress must re-examine the situation in China during these three months. Mr. Judd stated: Mr. Chi's bill represents the government's policy towards China, intending to distribute the unspent funds from the economic aid to China plan in September to delay the State Department's further consideration of aid to China.

### US Consul General Cabot's Speech: Policy Goal Toward China: Maintain the Historical Friendship Between the Two Peoples

[United States Information Service, this city] US Consul General to Shanghai, Cabot, stated on the evening of the 24th that the "highest goal" of US policy toward China must be to "maintain the historical friendship between our two peoples."

Cabot delivered his speech at the Armed Forces YMCA.

He stated: "The asset of unlimited value that we have for solving this problem (i.e., US policy toward China) is the friendship and trust of the Chinese people in us. We possess this asset because the Chinese people have known for a century that our actions have shown us to be honest and relatively disinterested friends. In the current situation, we should help the Chinese people formulate their own solutions, but we must not impose our solutions on China in such a way as to discard this asset."

Cabot vehemently refuted the Communist Party's accusation of "American imperialism" in China, calling this accusation "unreasonable and contradictory." He pointed out that the Communist Party's common tactic is often to "accuse others of what they themselves are doing." Regarding this point, he cited the record of imperialist acts committed by the Soviet Union in China.

Cabot stated: "We have repeatedly tried to help China, but some Chinese people mistakenly believe that we intend to exploit and rule them, which is truly perplexing. The Soviet Union has a long record of imperialism, successively plundering Tannu Tuva, Outer Mongolia, and Lushun, occupying Dalian, obtaining many privileges in Manchuria, and currently attempting to gain a special position in Xinjiang. Yet they believe that the Soviet Union is their closest friend, which is also puzzling."

Cabot responded to the CCP’s accusation that Nationalist leaders were completely subservient to the United States. He said, "Due to the past arrogance of other countries, the Chinese people have developed a kind of sensitivity, which is reasonable," but in view of this, the United States has not dared to offer advice to China that it would not hesitate to offer to other friendly countries. "It is also a fact that the Chinese government often rejects our requests based on its independent sovereignty. For example, they often fail to adopt our friendly suggestions, such as our suggestion that they give greater respect to the freedoms enshrined in the United Nations Charter, even in wartime." This opinion was not adopted.

Cabot also refuted the Communist Party's claim that the purpose of US aid was to expand US economic interests. Cabot stated: "We have $120 million invested in China, of which $46 million is invested in hospitals, universities, and similar non-profit organizations. Does the Communist Party believe that we are spending $400 million a year in aid to protect this investment?"

"In fact, we are helping China resist the threats of foreign tyranny, and of course, we are not considering our economic interests in doing so. We do not want to exploit China, and even if we wanted to exploit China, we could not do it."

Cabot emphasized that the Chinese people can solve China's problems and said that "the essence of dictatorship - whether it is communism or other forms - is violence, while the essence of democracy is persuasion."

### Commander-in-Chief Zhang Yaoming Broadcasts to the Citizens of Nanjing: Defending the Capital Is the Only Way to Achieve True Peace

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] Capital Garrison Commander-in-Chief Zhang Yaoming broadcast to the citizens of Nanjing at 6:15 PM on the 24th, explaining that the recent increase in robberies has led him to order the responsible agencies to step up their efforts to solve the cases and to formulate methods to prevent bandits. He also ordered each police precinct to thoroughly implement these measures. He also hoped that the news media would assist by publishing fewer destructive articles and more constructive news. Although the capital is facing the front line today, with the natural barrier of the Yangtze River, as long as we are united internally, strive for progress, train and organize the people, and establish a people's defense line, the Communist army will never be able to cross or sneak across. Only by guarding the Yangtze River and defending the capital can we achieve true peace, and only when true peace is realized can our lives and property be guaranteed.

### The Second Plenary Session of the Seventh CPC Congress Emphasizes the Importance of Cities, Believing That the Communist Party Must Be Built on Cities in the Future

[Our Newspaper] According to a report from the CPC radio station in Shijiazhuang on the 24th, the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held near Shijiazhuang. The session lasted for eight days and has ended successfully. Thirty-four members of the CPC Central Committee and nineteen alternate members attended the session, and twenty members were absent. Chairman Mao Zedong presided over the meeting and reported on the work to the entire session. The congress approved the work report of the Central Political Bureau since the First Plenary Session of the Party in June 1945 and approved the proposal of various democratic parties, people's organizations, and democrats to convene a new political consultative conference to establish a democratic coalition government. The plenary session also ratified Mao Zedong's statement on January 14 and the eight peace conditions he proposed as the basis for holding peace negotiations with the Nanjing National Government and any other local governments and military groups. The central issue of this Second Plenary Session of the Seventh CPC Congress focused on the shift in the focus of the Communist Party's work from rural areas to cities under the current situation. The party pointed out that since 1927, the focus of its revolutionary struggle has been in rural areas, gathering strength in rural areas, using rural areas to surround cities, and then seizing cities. However, today, the task of the Communist Party has restarted the period of going from cities to rural areas and from cities leading rural areas. The Communist Party's decision believes that cities and villages must be closely linked, and it is not permissible to abandon rural areas and only care about cities. It believes that the Communist Party must be built on cities in the future. The CPC pointed out that the Party's future work must use great efforts to lead the urban people to carry out their struggles, and at the same time, it should learn how to manage and build cities. The party believes that the key to managing and building cities is to restore and develop industrial production, including public, private, and handicraft production. In addition, attention should be paid to the organizational work of the Communist Party, the construction of political organs, trade union work, the organization and training of various mass organizations, public security work, and cultural and educational guidance, with restoring and developing industrial production as the central work. The meeting also called on its members to do their utmost to learn industrial production technology and management methods, as well as commercial work closely related to production. The party's declaration clearly warned its party that if the Communist Party fails to achieve rapid development in production work and cannot restore and achieve results, and first improve the lives of workers, the Communist Party and the people of the whole country will not be able to maintain their communist regime and will inevitably be overthrown. The Party earnestly calls on the working class, the peasantry, and intellectuals to serve as the leading and fundamental forces of this dictatorship, and at the same time, it calls for cooperation with the representatives of the petty bourgeoisie and the liberal bourgeoisie to overthrow the Kuomintang and the imperialist forces and transform China from an agricultural country to an industrial country, and from a new democratic country to a socialist country.

### Zhejiang Chamber of Commerce Telegram to Provincial Government: Fight for Fluorite Rights and Interests, Proceeds Must Be Allocated for Local Construction

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 24th] According to the Japanese publication "Zhejiang-Jiangxi Battle Record," the Japanese army's aim in attacking the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway during the war, capturing Wuyi, and seizing Xiangshan, was to steal fluorite, an important industrial raw material in the area. When Chen Yi was in charge of Zhejiang, he devoted himself to mining fluorite and exchanging it with Japan for rails, planning local construction, which was progressing smoothly. However, the Enemy Property Administration and the Assets Committee contended with the Zhejiang Provincial Government for the benefits of fluorite, leading to the fluorite being left to weather and decay.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th] The authorities here announced today that representatives of the six nations of Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg this morning reached an agreement: on the German border, involving approximately 58 square miles of land with a population of 12,000, there are nearly 30 minor revisions. The agreement is scheduled to be announced on the 6th. The rights of residents in the ceded areas will be protected, and there will be no need to change nationality. The border modification includes a village incorporated into the Saar region. It was also stated that, according to the principles recently stipulated by the French Foreign Ministry, French experts are not making annexation demands but are only separating the territory from Germany so that the small area where the water source is located can be used by nearby French villages.

[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] Experts from the six nations of Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, after studying the issue of German-Western border adjustments here for a week, decided today to cede 58 square miles of former German territory to the four nations of France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. This proposal will be submitted to the six governments for approval. This discussion only involved small-scale border adjustments. Large-scale adjustments demanded by the Netherlands, including demanding that Germany cede territory to compensate for Dutch land flooded by German troops during the war, will be discussed further.

[Reuters, London, 24th] Foreign Secretary Bevin left London today by train for Southampton to board the Queen Mary, departing for New York tomorrow to participate in the signing of the Atlantic Pact and attend the United Nations General Assembly. Foreign Ministry sources revealed that Bevin will discuss various issues with Secretary of State Acheson during his stay in the United States, including the Greek issue. Bevin's stay in the United States will last approximately two weeks, and he will rush back to attend the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference opening on April 23. Before returning to Europe, he may visit Ottawa and confer with Canadian Prime Minister Laurent.

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] It is reported that Secretary of State Acheson and other foreign ministers of the Atlantic Pact nations plan to hold important talks here on April 2 to discuss how to make the Atlantic Pact a future measure to prevent any Soviet aggression. At that time, Acheson, along with British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Schuman, will also discuss general issues between East and West, including Germany, Austria, the Berlin blockade, and the development of communism in Asia.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 23rd] According to authoritative sources, the British and French Foreign Ministers and U.S. Secretary of State Acheson intend to reach an agreement in principle on the following important issues concerning Germany during their future talks in Washington: (1) Occupation regulations, (2) Dismantling of German factories, (3) German prohibited industries.

### Heated Debate in the House of Commons on the European Situation: Britain Guarantees Continued Aid to Greece: Members Urge Attention to Soviet Policy Towards Germany

[United Press, London, 23rd] Foreign Secretary Bevin, concluding the overall debate on European issues in the House of Commons tonight, stated that we have not yet given up hope for the unity of Germany. I do not want to sever trade between East and West, but I will withhold any goods that could contribute to a war against Britain. He continued, Britain, the United States, and France still have two or three details to negotiate regarding the dismantling of German factories, and I hope that an agreement can be reached as soon as possible.

[Reuters, London, 23rd] Under-Secretary of State Mayhew assured the House of Commons today that Britain and the United States are determined to continue supporting the Greek government in its anti-communist war. Mayhew stated that the House can rest assured that military actions within Greece against rebels supported by foreign countries will not be weakened and will not be limited to the methods used in the past. Foreign Secretary Bevin will use this as one of the main topics of discussion when he meets with Acheson in the United States.

Previously, Conservative MP Macmillan pointed out that if the Greek civil war cannot be ended this summer, the morale and public spirit of Greece will tend to collapse. If Greece falls into the Iron Curtain, there will be two immediate consequences: one is that Yugoslavia will become a major accomplice of the Soviet Union due to Tito's downfall, and the other is that the entire Eastern Mediterranean region will become a line hostile to Britain, making the Suez Canal impossible to defend, and Iran will also inevitably fall into the Iron Curtain. Strategically speaking, the British-American group will revert to its original position in the summer of 1940.

[Reuters, London, 23rd] During today's debate in the House of Commons on Germany and Eastern Europe, Conservative MP Macmillan believed that the Soviet Union may be promoting a false appeasement policy in Germany, such as suggesting concluding a treaty with Germany stipulating the end of the four-power occupation of Germany. Macmillan pointed out that this is tantamount to Germany's kiss of death, and the result will be that the "bandit army" formed in East Germany over the past year will carry out a task similar to that carried out in Czechoslovakia, bringing communism to the banks of the Rhine in one fell swoop, destroying all the war gains that the Allied countries have achieved after six years of war. He believes that the only remedy to deal with Moscow's policies is to form a grand alliance to counter it.

### Spanish Question: No Change in British Policy

[Agence France-Presse, London, 23rd] Conservative MP Delling asked in the House of Commons why the government did not invite Spain to participate in talks on the Atlantic Pact, stating that Spain is crucial to Western European defense.

This plan still requires final approval at the Labour Party's National Conference in May this year.

### Balkan Crisis Lurks: Greece Asks the U.S. for Swift Military Aid: Soviet and Albania Secretly Discuss New Strategy Against Tito

[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 24th Broadcast: Athens Dispatch, Greek Prime Minister Sophoulis issued an appeal today, requesting that U.S. troops or other United Nations troops be sent to Greece to help defend the northern border plagued by communists. Sophoulis stated that the Greek government would be deeply grateful for this military assistance. Sophoulis stated that the Greek government's fight against communist guerrillas is international in nature and therefore suggested that friendly nations send troops to Greece in accordance with the United Nations Charter or the North Atlantic Treaty.

Sophoulis stated that the establishment of the United Nations Balkan Committee and the resolutions of the last UN General Assembly both prove the international nature of the Greek situation. The Greek Communist Party's announcement of the establishment of the "Slavic Macedonian National Liberation Front" further shows the guerrillas' intention to seize Yannitsa and Thessaloniki from Greece.

[United Press, Belgrade, 23rd] Political sources telegraphed on the 23rd that it is expected that Albanian Prime Minister Hoxha will sign a mutual assistance treaty with the Soviet Union during his visit to Moscow, aimed at indirectly resisting Yugoslavia. Albania is the only country in the Eastern European bloc that has not yet signed a mutual assistance treaty with the Soviet Union. Albania had signed a friendship agreement with Yugoslavia, but since the Cominform's break with Tito, the Albanian-Yugoslav friendship agreement has become virtually worthless. Observers here believe that Moscow summoned Hoxha to discuss a new strategy against Tito, and it is generally believed that Albania will play a leading role in this strategy.

### On the Eve of the Peace Congress: U.S. Releases White Paper: Soviet Refusal to Exchange U.S.-Soviet Culture

[United Press, Washington, 24th] The State Department released a 36-page white paper on the 24th, detailing the United States' failed attempts to establish cultural, scientific, and technological exchanges with the Soviet Union over the past 15 years. The release of the white paper comes on the eve of the "World Congress of Workers in the Cultural and Scientific Fields for Peace" being held in New York, which Soviet representatives are also attending. The State Department accused the Soviet government of being afraid to let the Soviet people understand the truth about the United States, stating that the department believes that Soviet leaders know that the free exchange of news will "weaken their iron grip on the Soviet people." The white paper further stated that the United States has tried to send scientists, technicians, educators, and artists to the Soviet Union, but "rarely succeeded." In the "few exceptions," Americans who were allowed to enter the Soviet Union were those whom the Soviet authorities deemed "politically acceptable." Conversely, the United States allows "any famous Soviet figures in the arts and sciences to enter the country, regardless of their political views."

### Austrian Peace Treaty Negotiations: Four-Power Consultations Achieve Nothing

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 24th Broadcast: Four-power foreign ministers' representatives discussed the Austrian Peace Treaty, and failed to reach an agreement on Yugoslavia's demands for compensation and territory from Austria. Upon the proposal of Soviet representative Zarubin and the agreement of other countries, it was decided to abandon the discussion and instead study the clauses concerning the handling of refugee issues. Zarubin will leave here next week for New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, and it is widely feared that the four-power foreign ministers' representatives' meeting on the Austrian Peace Treaty may not make any progress in this short period of time. After Zarubin leaves, the four-power representatives will face a difficult issue: whether to adjourn or suspend discussions, or to continue discussions with other Soviet representatives.

### New Commonwealth Structure: Will Include Defense Region: South Africa and Ceylon to Become Defense Centers

[United Press, London, 23rd] It has been learned here that after the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference is convened here on April 23, the Commonwealth Defense Ministers' Conference will follow before the end of the year in Colombo. The Commonwealth Prime Ministers will review the three plans for including "republic units" in the Commonwealth organization. The first plan was formulated by Sir Stafford Cripps, with King George as the nominal ruler of the United Kingdom. The core of the United Kingdom is the dominion, which maintains loyalty to the King. The outer dominion does not recognize the throne. The second plan was proposed by India, with the president of the republic as the constitutional representative of the monarch, avoiding using King George as the emperor of all overseas dominions. The third plan is a "regional organization," with the United Kingdom as the center and the dominion as the periphery. The King still maintains the position of dominion emperor. The dominion and the republic unit form a regional organization based on the Commonwealth. For example, the Republic of India will unite with Australia on a regional basis, thereby maintaining direct contact with the Commonwealth. Under this plan, Myanmar may also be allowed to join. It is generally believed that regardless of the outcome of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' meeting, the new Commonwealth structure will prepare for regional defense. The importance of South Africa and Ceylon is ranked first, as the two locations have been selected as defense centers. According to well-informed sources, Lieutenant General Mountbatten may reassume his position at the Kandy headquarters in Ceylon.

### This Newspaper Provides Important Clues to the Dismemberment Case; Discovery of the Origin of the Note Inside the Sleeve of the Woman's Jacket; Police Speculate the Case Contains Erotic Elements

[Report from this newspaper] Since the occurrence of the dismemberment case on Jinkee Road, the bizarre and intricate nature of the case has attracted widespread attention. To ensure accurate reporting of the case, this newspaper has mobilized all staff in the newsroom to assist the police in seeking clues. Late last night, a reporter from this newspaper, in a very accidental opportunity, discovered a calendar hanging on the wall with a strip of adage that read, "Enmity between others and me should be forgotten, not remembered." The wording, font, arrangement, sequence, and length of the note were exactly the same as a lead-printed note found inside the sleeve of the woman's jacket used to pad the corpse in the case. This calendar is a 1949 product of the Huaxin Calendar Factory at 997 Haining Road. In the entire 300-plus pages, only February 11th and October 21st contain the aforementioned adage. The position of the sentence is below the date, arranged from right to left, printed in six-point type. The calendar paper is white newsprint, approximately one and a half inches in length. After discovering this mystery, the reporter from this newspaper immediately inquired by phone with Cheng Yi-kuan, the chief of the Changshu Road police precinct, at 2:00 AM this morning. Cheng was extremely surprised upon hearing this, believing that this discovery would greatly assist the investigation work. He also confirmed that the note inside the package was indeed cut from this type of calendar. This is because, other than the top half of the page, including the date, being completely cut off, everything else is exactly the same. Cheng stated: "Since this adage was printed on the February 11th calendar, it is possible that the murderer, upon seeing this adage on that day, felt it coincided with their motive for killing and therefore retained it. From that day on, they concretely considered methods of murder and corpse disposal, and subsequently decided to implement them." According to the reporter's observation: the entire process, from the murderer's initial intention, to the act, to the cover-up, likely spanned from February 11th to March 21st.

### Four Examinations Confirm Hair Turning Black; Determines the Deceased Was Indeed a Chinese National

[Report from this newspaper] Another "reversal" has been discovered in the Jinkee Road headless dismemberment case: based on the results of the fourth detailed examination of the deceased's body, it has been proven that the victim was not a foreigner, but definitely a Chinese national.

During the third examination the day before yesterday, it was determined that the slightly yellowish-white color of the corpse's hair was discovered yesterday to be due to the application of preservatives. Therefore, the color of the hair is now gradually turning black. Furthermore, the entire body's hair follicles are delicate and even, and the nipples on the chest are not large. Although the muscles are firm and the feet are relatively wide, there are also many Chinese people with good physiques. Therefore, after piecing together the body parts and conducting a detailed examination yesterday, the forensic examiners affirmed that the deceased was definitely not a foreigner.

As for why the deceased was killed? And where was the deceased killed? The police officers responsible for investigating the case believe that because the dismemberment of the body was exceptionally clean and without any bloodstains, it can be proven that the murderer spent at least seven hours dealing with the body. Carrying out this kind of work for such a long time must have been done indoors without a doubt. Furthermore, based on the woman's jacket and the child's open-crotch pants used to wrap the body, a woman must have lived in this room. Since no family members or women have come forward to report or show signs of also being victimized since the case occurred, this woman must be suspected of conspiring with the murderer. Regardless of whether this woman had a deeper relationship with the deceased or a closer relationship with the murderer, in short, this case contains a story of erotic entanglements, and it is highly possible that the murderer committed this act out of jealousy. However, it is still impossible to determine whether the murder site was in this city or in another city.

A Worker on Jinkee Road Saw a Passenger Carrying Packages

In addition, the investigating police officers yesterday discovered another new lead: according to "Old Wang," the gatekeeper of the Qilu Villas (the site where the dismembered remains were first discovered was behind the villas), a road worker on Jinkee Road saw a pedicab carrying a passenger get out next to the villas after dusk on the 19th, take a package, and hurriedly follow the dirt road (see attached diagram) towards the field. The situation afterwards was not noticed. Considering that it rained on both the 19th and 20th, and the case was discovered on the morning of the 21st, because the paste on the package was not completely wet, it is determined that the murderer's corpse disposal work was done before dawn on that day. Then, is this passenger carrying packages on the 19th related to this case? The police are currently conducting an investigation.

The Murderer Came from the City; Took Jinkee Road

According to the police's current deduction, at least two or more people participated in the case, from the murder to the corpse disposal. The original shape of the discovered remains was that the package was leaning against the back door of the Qilu Villas, and another travel bag was placed in a small pit. The police point to this as a sign that two people participated in the arrangement at the same time. Furthermore, the nearby area is mostly wasteland, fields, or tomb sites. The murderer often specifically chose a hidden place behind the villas to dispose of the corpse, which shows that they were already familiar with the situation in that area. In terms of transportation, inspections at Hongqiao Airport are quite strict, and the chance of the murderer bringing the corpse to Shanghai by air is very small. If the murderer got off at the Xinhongqiao station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, they could throw away the package anywhere to avoid attention, without having to come specifically near the villas. Since both air and land routes are less likely, the police determined that the murderer came from the city, and that they necessarily took Jinkee Road.

### Commemorating the Art Festival; Celebration Held Today

### City Council Holds Tea Party This Afternoon; Discussing Retaining Mayor Wu

Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Speaker Xu Jiyu, and all city councilors will attend.

### Altering Municipal Bank Drafts; Yue Tiankai Sentenced to Six Months

[Report from this newspaper] Yue Tiankai, also known as Tong Wei, altered a Shanghai Municipal Bank draft with the serial number 357716, valued at 500 gold yuan, to 50,000 gold yuan and exchanged it for cash from Zhu Defu. The draft was returned to the municipal bank and discovered on December 3rd of last year. After a tortuous investigation, it was learned that Yue had used it. Later, Zhu Bao and Xu Zhenxiang, agents of the bank, mediated the situation, and Yue admitted to paying in installments. However, the checks he issued were all returned due to insufficient funds. Therefore, the case was brought to the court. After investigation and prosecution by the prosecutor, Ruan Qin, the judge of the district court, pronounced the verdict yesterday: Yue Tiankai used altered valuable securities and was sentenced to six months of imprisonment.

### Municipal Industrial Association Convened Various Industries Yesterday; Discussing the Allocation of Gasoline and Diesel

[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Industrial Association convened relevant industries at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon to discuss the issue of gasoline and diesel allocation. Li, the vice chairman of the Transportation Control Committee, and Dong Dingfeng, the group leader of the gasoline and diesel allocation group of the association, attended the meeting. First, Vice Chairman Li reported on the principles and procedures of allocation. Then, representatives from various industries expressed their opinions, which can be summarized into four points: (1) After the allocation quotas of gasoline and diesel for each factory are set, they should be allowed to withdraw oil and pay in installments within the specified time, in order to reduce the economic burden of each factory. (2) There is an increasing number of black market oil on the market, while the Transportation Control Committee allocates very little gasoline and diesel to various industries. Please ask the competent authorities to investigate the source of the black market oil and the reason for the reduction in oil allocation. (3) Request the government to abolish the import limit of gasoline and diesel in order to increase the oil source and stabilize the oil price. (4) In the past, some factories used coal as fuel. Currently, there is a serious coal shortage, and they have to switch to diesel. These factories should be given the opportunity to apply for oil allocation. As a result, Vice Chairman Li agreed with the first point of withdrawing oil and paying in installments. The remaining points will be forwarded to the Transportation Control Committee and the competent authorities for reference.

### Base Prices for Hairdressing and Bathing; Social Bureau to Confer and Decide Today; Both Industries Hope to Set a Formula for Gradual Adjustment

[Report from this newspaper] The base prices for hairdressing and bathing, which were previously drafted by the two industry associations and submitted to the Social Bureau for review, will be decided by the Social Bureau in consultation with representatives of the two industry associations this morning, so that they can be submitted to the municipal government for approval and announcement. According to the person in charge of the Social Bureau yesterday: they are currently reviewing the pre-war account books of the two industries to compare them with the current prices in order to seek a more reasonable base price. Among these two industries, the hairdressing industry is easier to solve than the bathing industry. The common difficult problem for these two industries is that the cost-of-living index is published twice a month, and the prices are also adjusted twice. However, prices fluctuate every day and every hour. Within one or two days after the cost-of-living index is released, the prices suddenly increase, and business will inevitably be slow. Within one or two days before the cost-of-living index is released, because it is lower than other prices, customers will be extremely crowded. These two industries do not want this phenomenon to occur. It is best to increase prices gradually so that daily business maintains a certain level. It is heard that public utilities have a hypothetical index, and they gradually adjust according to this hypothetical index. These two industries also hope to set a formula that includes the calculation of various costs and gradually adjust according to this formula to maintain equilibrium with the rate of price increase so that the distance is not too far. The Social Bureau is considering this method, and a decision will be made at today's meeting.

### Three Drafts of Rent Standards; To Be Revised and Submitted for Discussion Today

[Report from this newspaper] The three drafts of rent standards in this city drafted by the Land Administration Bureau were submitted to the Municipal Affairs Conference for discussion.

Yesterday morning, Zhu Zhaoquan, the director of the Municipal Government Council Chamber, invited representatives from the Land Administration Bureau, the Real Estate Association, and the Tenants' Association to confer and decide on a more concrete method, which will be submitted to the Municipal Affairs Conference for discussion today.

### Military Exercises; Stray Bullet Kills a Boy

[Report from this newspaper] Yang Chunlin, a 23-year-old pedicab driver from Jiangbei, lived at No. 10, Lane 111, Caohejing. Because he had just recovered from an illness, he could not drive a pedicab to make a living. In view of his early illiteracy, he was extremely resentful. Recently, he went to Jianghuai Elementary School on Caoxi Road to study.

Unexpectedly, a military unit stationed there was conducting live ammunition exercises in Caohejing.

### Unoccupied Land in Hartung Garden - Sale Delayed, No Transaction Completed - Ji Juemi Accused of Fraud - Brought to Court Ill, Trial Concluded, Awaiting Verdict - Female Relatives Beside, Constantly Checking Pulse

[Report from this Newspaper] Ji Juemi, the elderly chief accountant of Hartung, a Buddhist convert, was accompanied by his female relatives and brought to court ill yesterday in response to a summons from Huang Guangyu, Presiding Judge of the First Criminal Court of the District Court, regarding the lawsuit filed by Huang Sizhao accusing him of fraud in connection with the sale of land in the Hartung Garden. Ji wore Buddhist yellow shoes and carried a cane. The plaintiff in the case, Huang Kezhao, stated in court: On September 15th of last year, Ji entrusted Fan Yunzhan, the manager of the Juemi Trading Company, as his authorized representative, along with staff members Zhang Haitong and Tan Boya, with a letter of authorization personally signed by Ji, to sell five mu, four fen, six ya, and seven hao of unoccupied land within the Hartung Garden on Middle Zhengzheng Road. A sales contract was signed, with a total price of 480,000 Gold Yuan, and an initial deposit of 50,000 Gold Yuan, equivalent to 250 taels of gold at the then current value, was paid. By the seventh day of the following month, the defendant's three representatives sent him a letter demanding payment of the outstanding amount, along with a photograph of a letter from Ji to the representatives, stating that there was no intention to renege on the agreement. He agreed and replied to Fan and others, scheduling the completion of the transaction for the ninth day of the same month. However, when the date arrived, Fan and others avoided meeting. He sent two letters on the 19th and 29th of the same month urging them to proceed, but they were returned on the grounds that they were not in Shanghai. On November 2nd, he sent another letter to the Juemi Trading Company, requesting that it be forwarded to the defendant. He then received a reply from Ji on the 6th of the same month, stating that he was not aware of the above transaction before or after it occurred. Given the actions of the defendant's three representatives, Ji clearly had the suspicion of committing fraud. The civil portion of the case is being litigated separately. The defendant, granted a seat by the court, argued: It is true that he entrusted Fan and the other three to handle the sale of the unoccupied land. However, at the time, he was receiving medical treatment in Hong Kong due to illness. The telegrams from the three did not specify that the price was in Gold Yuan. He believed that the price should be in gold bars due to the devaluation of the Gold Yuan at the time, and there were many unfair terms in the contract, so the transaction was not completed. Ji's answers were given in a low voice, and he frequently spat. His female relatives were beside him taking care of him, constantly checking his pulse, and often interjected on his behalf, all of which were stopped by the court. Next, Fan Yunzhan and the other three were summoned to testify. They all stated that they were unaware of Ji's reply letter on October 6th. Fan also stated: At the time, they were indeed entrusted by Ji to calculate the price in gold units. However, when they signed the contract with Huang, it coincided with the currency system reform, so they calculated the price in Gold Yuan. The defendant had no intention to defraud. The court instructed the lawyers of both sides to present their final arguments, and the verdict was scheduled for 2:00 PM on the 28th of this month.

### Prospects for Zhejiang Farmers' Schools

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng from This Newspaper

[Report from This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 22nd] Amidst the nationwide drive to increase production, farmers' schools in Zhejiang Province, after more than four months of preparation, have begun teacher training in Songmucheng, a suburb of Hangzhou. This is part of former Zhejiang Province Chairman Chen Gongqia's two major agricultural policies: land reform and farmers' schools. The farmers' school was approved at the 1570th meeting of the Zhejiang Provincial Government Committee on August 19, 1948. A preparatory committee was established, appointing the directors of the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department and Education Department, the director of the Agricultural Improvement Institute, the presidents of the Agricultural Colleges of Zhejiang University, Ying University, and Jinling University, the principal of the Zhejiang Provincial Rural Normal School, the director of the Hangzhou Municipal Garden Management Office, two agricultural problem consultants to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the provincial government member concurrently serving as the director of the Zhejiang Provincial Reclamation Committee as preparatory committee members. The preparatory committee established five secretaries and three clerks to handle daily affairs. After drafting regulations, determining the teacher training venue, and surveying the locations of farmers' schools in various counties, teacher training recruitment began. The training course commenced in January 1949.

Empowering Farmers with Practical Benefits

From Zhejiang's geographical perspective, the so-called prosperous but lacking area refers only to surface production. Because Zhejiang is poor in mineral resources and lacks coal and iron, its future prospects depend on improving surface production. Today, in rural areas, farming power is scattered, agricultural tools are outdated, farmhouses are dilapidated, and the lives of farmers are unbearable. How can we talk about increasing production? How can we talk about improving production? The so-called rural education that provides practical benefits to farmers, cooperative agricultural loans, etc., are merely scratching the surface, not addressing the root of the problem. Because those who provide practical benefits to farmers are disconnected from them, unaware of their needs, and unable to understand their feelings, they cannot live with them and understand their suffering.

Teacher Training: Series A and B

Zhejiang Province's farmers' schools were created to address this premise. Their teachers are divided into two series, A and B. Series A focuses on specialized agriculture, while Series B focuses on language and general knowledge. Series A requires a degree from an agricultural college and at least one year of agricultural work experience, or graduation from a senior agricultural vocational school and at least three years of agricultural work experience. Series B requires graduation from a normal school or high school and at least three years of service in agriculture or social administration and cultural education. They recruited 60 people for Series A and 40 people for Series B. In the morning, they attend academic classes, and in the afternoon, everyone goes barefoot to the fields to practice, mastering various new techniques for increasing production, such as cultivation, irrigation, fertilization, and the use of new methods such as machinery. At the same time, they study methods for transforming the impoverished rural environment, such as hygiene, medical treatment, educating children, daily life, and social interaction. Teacher training lasts for six months, after which they graduate and are assigned to farmers' schools in various counties as principals or teachers. After these many teachers go to the farmers' schools, they will actually engage in operations and cooperate with the farmers in the farmers' schools. They will let the farmers learn in doing, and teach the farmers in learning. This of course can better understand their needs and feelings, and at the same time live with them, which can also understand their suffering, and then solve them.

Training Conditions for Farmers

The farmers who receive training in the farmers' schools themselves are not subject to any restrictions, as long as they have practical farming experience, are physically strong, have good character, and are slightly literate, and are between the ages of twenty and thirty-five. Each school mainly has 60 people. During their training period, in addition to all the costs of food, accommodation, and operations being provided by the school, each person is also allocated three to five mu of harvest from the total amount of labor harvested on the farm as a subsidy. Each of them also allocates three to five mu of cultivated land for operation and cooperation. They take operation as a course, fields as classrooms, and school buildings and dormitories use public houses or improved existing farmhouses. If it is necessary to build another one, it must be similar to ordinary farmhouses, and improved to serve as a model for new rural construction. The school site must be chosen to be convenient for transportation and moderately located. After they graduate, they return to their own homes. They become the core of rural improvement in rural society. In the future, all places where the government cooperatively lends and gives practical benefits to the countryside will be handled by farmers who have graduated from farmers' schools, and then lent to the vast countryside. The government can also pass on any laws and regulations to the vast number of farmers through the farmers after graduation. They will also teach the experience they have learned to other farmers. In this way, Zhejiang's rural symbols can be changed. We are very admired by this foresight.

Students in the Teacher Training Class

The reporter was invited to give a special lecture to all the students receiving training in the farmers' school teacher training, and took this opportunity to visit everything in the teacher training class. The 100 students in the teacher training class were all young and strong, wearing the crimson-cyan cotton-padded jackets and trousers that were issued to them. Everyone was quickly sorting out their homework, diligently taking notes in the lecture hall. In the afternoon, everyone worked hard to cultivate the fields. I have visited several students, and they all take transforming the countryside as their duty. They believe that today's farmland in China is not yet "fully employed", so using new technologies and new machinery to cultivate can obtain a large amount of production, and the increase in production can also improve the lives of farmers. They don't want to get rich, nor do they want to become officials. They are willing to take the revitalization of China's rural cause as their lifelong career.

New Machinery and New Technology

I have visited their machinery, including several tractors, a rice threshing machine, harrows, plows, and many shovels. According to the head teacher, Ju Jinsan, "The Central Pest and Disease Research Committee is willing to cooperate with the teacher training class and will be stationed in the class. In addition, the livestock department in the veterinary school is also willing to cooperate with the teacher training class and will be stationed in the class. Therefore, the future of the teacher training class is very bright." Wen is the Dean of the Agricultural College in Taichung, the agricultural center of Taiwan. He has unlimited hope for farmers' schools. The two of us have looked forward to the beautiful prospects of agriculture in Zhejiang Province and even the whole country. With rural areas organized, every farmer will be able to use new machinery and new technologies, and every farmer will be able to operate tractors. There will be machinery repair shops and machinery gas stations between several rural areas. Farmhouses have also been improved, and farmers live very comfortably. All new Chinese industries are developing in coordination with the lives of the vast majority of farmers and agricultural production, and chimneys are erected one by one in the countryside.

Problem of Enrollment Age

After returning from the farmer's school teacher training class, the reporter deeply felt that the enrollment age of this kind of farmer's school for farmers can also be lowered to below 20 years old, because the national primary schools in the countryside that have been promoted to this day, with their rigid classes and the same books as in the cities, have made farmers feel no interest in them at all. Therefore, the reporter has traveled to many rural areas in various provinces of China, and the national primary schools only hang an empty sign, the double doors are tightly closed, and the songs are never able to continue. If we use this method of farmer's schools in Zhejiang Province to educate farmers under the age of 20, then farmers will definitely express their strong support. From this, we think that farmer's schools may be divided into several grades, assuming that the primary class is for farmers under 10 years old to study, the intermediate class is for farmers over 12 years old to study, and the senior class is for farmers over 20 and under 35 years old to study. The senior class can be the current teacher training class, the teachers of the intermediate class are the graduates of the senior class, and the teachers of the primary class are the graduates of the intermediate class. In the primary class, as long as the general teaching materials of the national primary school are added, the emphasis is still on production and practice, according to the highest principle of education "do, learn, teach". In this way, know and transmit immediately, not only will the countryside quickly recover, but the benefits to farmers will also be considerable.

Included in the Education System

Not long ago, the first session of the fifth session of the Zhejiang Provincial Assembly was held, just when Chen Gongqia left Zhejiang and Zhou Fengzhang succeeded him as the head of Zhejiang. In the discussion of the Provincial Assembly, it was believed that the farmers' school spent too much public funds, so it was resolved to request the Provincial Government to abolish it. However, according to the reporter's knowledge, Chairman Ju is currently hesitating, because the representatives of the Provincial Assembly advocate abolishing the school based on public opinion, while the former chairman runs this school and has his own painstaking efforts. The other day, Director of Education Li Jigu gave instructions to his colleagues in the Department of Education, saying that the farmers' school still has to be run, but a few classes should be reduced, because the original regulations stipulated that one school should be established in each of the 30 selected counties starting from the next semester of this year. From this point of view, the farmers' school will still have to be run. Of course, Chairman Zhou also saw the actual situation in the countryside today. The reporter feels that if my opinion above is adopted, and the farmer's school is clearly included in the education system, and the national primary schools in the countryside that are famous but not actually used are abolished and farmer's schools are run instead, wouldn't that be better?

### Murder Case in Jianhu Township, Qishuyan - Criminals Li Zijin and Others Detained

[Report from This Newspaper, Wujin, 23rd] The village of Shijiatang in Jianhu Township, Qishuyan District, has only seven or eight households. Villager Shi Xilin, over 30 years old, has been a widower for quite some time. Last year, he was introduced to work as a waiter in a theater on the coal cinder beach of the Qishuyan Machine Factory. At the same time, Yang Aren, the wife of Sun Heshang from the same village, a middle-aged woman, also worked in the theater from time to time. Soon, they began living together. However, Yang Aren recently became involved with Li Zijin, a villager from a nearby village, and often secretly met for romantic encounters, which soon led to murder. On the clean night of the 10th, as Xilin and Aren were sleeping together, Sun Heshang suddenly arrived. Li Zijin and three others called Shi Xilin out, never to return. On the 19th, villagers found Xilin's clothes in a mud puddle in Huangni Gou, but no body was found. Later, after dredging, the body of Yang Er was found. The district government immediately arrested Li Zijin, who confessed to the murder of Shi Xilin. The Qishuyan District has now escorted the criminal Li Zijin to the city for interrogation, and Sun Heshang has also been arrested and is on his way to be escorted.

### Rice Mixed with Sand and Soil - Those Involved in Malpractice Being Investigated

[Report from This Newspaper, Jurong, 22nd] On the 18th, the county's Field Grain Office discovered two carts of county-level public grain sent from the Zhongji Yaomi Factory to the Chenwuzhuang warehouse, containing large chunks of mud and sand. The office immediately took Pan Jie, the son of warehouse director Pan, and Ou Rujiang, the foreman and warehouse clerk, to the county. Then, each unopened rice bag was opened and checked. It was found that there were 40 catties of mud and seven bags of sand-containing grain. Each bag was sealed after being signed by the parties involved. The matter is currently being investigated and dealt with severely. It is said that the weigher Ji Zaixiu and the foreman and warehouse clerk Ou Rujiang are more heavily involved.

### Shanghai and North China Remittance: Xinhua, China Industrial, and Other Banks Begin Trial Operations

The total amount of remittance for each bank per day is temporarily limited to one million Gold Yuan.

[Our Newspaper] Several banks in this city have started handling North-South remittances in recent days. However, the amount of remittance is not large, and it is mostly limited to those who have funds available for transfer in both regions. It is understood that the banks handling remittances between Shanghai and Peiping include Xinhua, China Industrial Enterprise, Salt & Pharmaceutical, Jincheng, and Shanghai. In addition to the above five, the banks handling remittances between Tianjin and Shanghai include Da Mu, Ju Xingcheng, and China General Chamber of Commerce. Yesterday, this reporter inquired about the remittance situation at various banks and confirmed that this remittance is still in the trial stage. Remittances between Tianjin and Shanghai have been suspended for a relatively long time, and there are still technical difficulties to be overcome before they can be resumed. Remittances between Peiping and Shanghai have begun to resume. The following is an account of the remittance operations of several banks: (1) Currently, the targets of remittance are mostly small remittances from public employees, teachers, and students' families. Large commercial remittances have not yet been seen. (2) The remittance rate is 20% according to the regulations of the People's Bank of China, regardless of direction. Most remittances are telegraphic transfers, and funds remitted today can arrive the next day. The telegraphic transfer fee for each remittance from Shanghai to Peiping is 6,000 Gold Yuan. (3) Currently, each remittance from Shanghai to Peiping is approximately 100,000 Gold Yuan, which is converted into Renminbi at the exchange rate of Peiping Renminbi to Gold Yuan on the date of arrival. For example, yesterday's rate was 23 to 1, meaning that 23 Gold Yuan would be converted into 1 Renminbi. (4) It is said that remittances from Peiping to Shanghai must first be applied for to the Communist People's Bank of China and approved before the remittance can be made. Currently, most remittances from Peiping are 3,000 Renminbi. Large commercial remittances can generally reach 5 million Gold Yuan per remittance, with no special restrictions, but such remittances have not yet been handled.

### National Banks Massively Sell Off, Gold Market Still Strong

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday's gold market opened in the morning with a stalemate in trading due to pressure from bank sell-offs. After the market opened at 9:30 am, brokers were shouting offers but no transactions occurred, due to the substantial overnight differences by the banks. Yesterday, the silver market was loose and abundant, and thus people were eager to buy, making it difficult to open the market. Subsequently, Da De Cheng first sold at 5.95 million, and trading began. However, Da De Cheng was selling on behalf of the central bank, and as soon as the price was announced, people were pleased, and there were many sales in the market, so the price fell back to around 5.90 million. However, the decline was limited, the bulls had excessive interest, and the silver market was still loose, and the implicit interest rate was also low, so the holders were unwilling to sell at low prices under pressure, and the market was quickly bought up again, and the price rebounded to 5.95 million, but there were still few sales.

Subsequently, the central bank sold unlimited amounts at 5.95 million, and people's minds stabilized, and the overnight floating bulls sold off at high prices, and the market slightly lowered, and the price was 5.93 million. Subsequently, the off-market trend was high, and people's minds were again firm, and there were buy orders at 5.94 million, and the market fluctuated for a long time. Finally, the floating retail investors considered that the rise was limited, and there were not many buyers, and the sales were frequent, and the market was slightly tired, and closed at 5.93 million at noon.

[Another News] In order to stabilize prices, the central bank massively sold off materials in the gold and cotton yarn markets starting yesterday. In the gold market, 12,700 taels were sold in the morning, recovering 7.55665 billion yuan in currency. In the cotton yarn market, the Textile Construction Company sold 324 pieces of 20-count Dou Chuan yarn, each piece at 1.88 million, and 212 pieces of 20-count Shenhu yarn, each piece at 1.84 million, recovering a total of 1.07 billion yuan in currency.

[Another News] The gold market trend was still soft in the afternoon, because the central bank sold off a large amount in the morning market, and the buying power of the banks had been saturated. The holders who bought in the morning market felt the pressure on their positions, and they were anxious to arrange for it in the afternoon. Some holders also rushed to close their positions, and the market had more supply than demand, and the closing price fell back again. It opened at 5.87 million, and once rose to 5.88 million. After the bulls pulled up the price, they began to sell off again, and the price fell to 5.8 million. Subsequently, retail investors bought in, and the market rose after falling. The closing price was 5.86 million. The above transactions were all for same-day positions, and overnight delivery would require additional interest.

The US dollar market turned around due to the impact of gold sales. The market opened slightly quietly in the morning, the middle trend was stable, and the noon closing price returned. The opening price was 12,200 yuan, 12,300 yuan, and the noon closing price was 12,000 yuan, 12,000 yuan.

### Market Ramblings: Spectators

Hong Kong's Opening of Gold Import Ban Says: Fear of a Buying Spree

Hong Kong, in the past, agreed to the Chinese government's request to ban gold imports. Although it was only a formal ban, in reality, not a small amount still flowed from the mainland. However, when it flowed in, it was all smuggling, and there were inevitably small expenses.

Hong Kong's promise was to help China stabilize its currency value.

It is said that the Hong Kong authorities are now reconsidering this gentleman's agreement. Originally, free import was prohibited, so the current reconsideration is of course considering restoring free import.

This news has already been reflected in the Hong Kong gold market since yesterday.

Since this week, the price of gold in Hong Kong has jumped from 304 yuan to over 314 yuan, once reaching as high as 316 yuan. Because of the news, the price of gold in Hong Kong quickly fell to around 310 yuan.

Let's not underestimate this news from Hong Kong. If it is not true, then everything will remain unchanged. If it is true, the motive is of course to absorb gold from the mainland.

Therefore, the competition for gold between the mainland and Hong Kong, and the future of gold prices, have more reasons to be optimistic.

Judging from the recent news of the devaluation of the pound, the excessive expansion of the issuance of Hong Kong dollars, and the many new events that have been attacked by gentlemen, the possibility of Hong Kong restoring free gold imports is very high.

In the macro environment, we are facing a critical moment.

The stock market's slump indicates many underlying currents. What can be pointed out is that people who were originally investing in a proper manner are selling out at high prices. Even old holdings are being sold off in part. With such high interest rates, retail investors are of course happy to adopt a long-term and profitable strategy. It is said that although most "rats" are multi-necked, they can withstand such high interest rates. They really treat "kings" as fools.

As for the general commodity market, there is a gradual trend towards higher prices. Regardless of whether one is optimistic or pessimistic about the overall situation, those who have foreign exchange relationships and need to import goods seem to hope for the best. The lack of real sales is a temporary situation. Once the situation changes, there will be a fear of a shortage of goods.

According to analysts in various industries, within the scope of commodities, chemical raw materials and essential Western medicines that cannot be replaced domestically can be stockpiled. For example, petroleum jelly and carbolic acid cannot be replaced domestically, so one should look for treasures within the scope of irreplaceable and widely used products. As for prepared medicines, they believe that: (1) foreign inventions are constantly changing, (2) domestic products are also trying to imitate them as much as possible; therefore, good brands are not bad.

Paper was originally a good product. However, recently Europe and the United States have been devaluing and dumping paper, and the quantity shipped to Hong Kong is very large, so there is not much potential in the short term.

### Loose Money, Rising Production Prices, Rice Market Slightly Firm, Flour Rises and Then Weakens, Oil Prices Remain Firm

Rice prices have slightly increased because the silver market is loose, and the price of tin has risen. The owners have raised their prices. The prices of various japonica and indica rice in the northern market have increased by 3,000 yuan. White japonica rice is 65,500 yuan, and special japonica rice is 68,000 yuan. The southern market opened with an increase of 3,000 yuan, but later weakened slightly due to sluggish sales. The final increase was 2,000 yuan. White japonica rice is 62,000 yuan, and glutinous rice sales are good, and the market trend is quieter. A total of 7,250 stones arrived in the two markets.

Edible oil has continued to rise. Yesterday, because the silver market was still loose, people were quite firm. Soybean oil opened at 285,000 and closed at 290,000, and it was impossible to buy it. It is estimated to have risen by 22,000. Rapeseed oil rose by 15,000 yuan. Jilong rapeseed oil was 380,000 yuan, an increase of 20,000. The closing was very firm. Soybean cake dealers were buying, an increase of 1,500 yuan.

Flour rose and then weakened. At the beginning, the prices of various goods outside the circle were high, and the factory supply was not large, so the owners strongly increased their prices. The old cars rose by more than 1,000 yuan, and the warship once reached a high of 23,100 yuan. In the middle, it was heard that the central bank was selling again, and the funds were reported to be small, and the market turned weak. The later market finally fell sharply. The old cars retreated to 23,800 yuan, and the warship was traded at 22,950 yuan.

Coarse grains were still firm. The later market expected the silver market to tighten, and various goods were mostly reluctant to sell. Only soybeans were still popular due to the oil cake, and the factory sauce shops were all buying. The market trend continued to be firm, the supply of raw peanuts was extremely rare, and it rose again by 10,000 yuan. Yangzhou Tizhuang broke the 200,000 yuan mark. Sesame was firm, and corn rose first and then fell back.

### New Longjing Tea Has Little Stock

The opening price is 10,000 yuan per catty.

It is understood that Mingqian New Longjing tea is made from the buds of tea plants that have just sprouted before the Qingming Festival in the lunar calendar, which are picked and baked, and sold domestically in large quantities. It is heard that the new goods this year have been priced in Shanghai from the Wenzhou production area, but the amount is very small, only about 10 catties. After hearing the news, the tea shops in this city rushed to buy them. As a result, Dacheng Long, Ding Juntai, and Da Shanghai tea shops were the first to obtain them. The opening price is 10,000 yuan per catty.

According to people in the industry, although the market atmosphere is quite激昂, the quality aspect is not as good as previous years, because the weather is out of order, affecting the development of tea plants.

### Heavy Pressure from Short Positions: Chinese Stocks Crash

[Our Newspaper] The Chinese stock market was firm first and then weak yesterday. Because the central bank sold gold and yarn, starting a killing spree, the domestic short positions were strong, and the market turned from rising to falling.

At first, it was heard that the overnight differences by the banks were huge, and the silver market was loose, which caused a buying spree. After the opening of the market, all stocks showed an uptrend. Later, the news of gold and yarn sales spread, and people were panicked. The market was full of sell orders, and the market crashed.

Yongsheng Yarn opened at 7.8 jiao. Outside the market, there were offers as high as 7.9 jiao. The feeling of the winter market was strong, and the banks were absorbing the stock. It rose to 7.92 jiao, and then continued to be firm, with a very good trend, continuing to reach a peak of 7.98 jiao.

After 11 o'clock, the Textile Construction Company sold cotton yarn again. The yarn gang all came to sell, and the decline was even more violent. Until the close of the market, because of the prosperity of the short positions, the trading desk had no strength to struggle, and the afternoon closed at a low price of 7.22 jiao, which was 6 fen lower than the previous day's afternoon close.

Small and medium-sized stocks all rose at the beginning, and eventually turned weak. Xinguang fell from a peak of 8.7 jiao to 7.75 jiao at the noon close. Meiya fell from 2.5 yuan to 2.16 yuan. Dongxing, Jingfu, Xinhe, and Tongyi were still flat at the morning opening and closing, with very narrow fluctuations. The rest of the miscellaneous brands all fell sharply. The total transaction volume for the day was 4.77395 billion shares.

### Foreign Stocks Flat and Weak, Gold Bonds Rise Again

The foreign stock market was flat and weak. The opening in the morning was average compared to the closing price in Hong Kong, and people were not sincere. The buying was not strong. Yisha was offered at 15,200 yuan, 15,400 yuan. Asia was offered at 15,200 yuan, 15,400 yuan, each being 200 to 300 yuan lower. Yinglian was still offered at 20,000 yuan, 21,000 yuan, with not much change. Huideli was 61,000 yuan, 63,000 yuan, which was still flat compared to the previous day.

### Silk Flat

The silk market turned brisk yesterday. The money market turned loose, the buying sentiment turned strong. It was also heard that the China Trust Bureau would stop allocating it this week, so people's hearts turned firm.

1.2 million once rose to 2.65 million. At the close, because the intention to sell gradually increased, and the price of gold was reported to be small, the market turned slightly weak, and still closed at 2.6 million at noon. The overnight position was 2.66 million.

Raw silk opened in the morning at a high-grade price of 3.8 million. After the opening, because the money market was loose, the holders held up the price and rose to 3.85 million. Finally, it closed at 3.9 million at noon. The D-grade 78 evenness white factory silk closed at a high of 450,000 yuan at noon.

The silk and satin of Dacheng was opened in the morning at 1.9 million, and it immediately rose by 20,000 yuan. In the middle, because the selling wind was popular, people's hearts were not振, the cotton yarn outside the market fell back, and the gold market was mediocre. The buying sentiment was very weak, and it fell from 1.92 million back to 1.85 million at the noon close.

### Rayon Allocation Suspended

[Our Newspaper] The China Trust Bureau's rayon meeting on the 23rd decided that the 12th type of this year (21st to 26th) was stopped because the rayon from other ports had not yet been shipped out. Next Tuesday will be a holiday, and this battle will be suspended.

### Tung Oil Transactions Sparse

Since the transit transportation of tung oil has evolved, the market yesterday was still like a prairie fire, spreading repeatedly. Considering the abundance of positions in the industry, the repeated breaking of records for items outside the industry, and the adjustments in public utilities, the holders felt that the cost was forced to increase, and the offer price soared. The increase still reached more than 10,000 yuan, but the actual sales were still unchanged. Transactions were still very sluggish due to only inter-industry transactions.

### Huili Rides on Victory: Again Defeats Formidable Shanghai Police; Encas Loses to Pfeiffer by One Point

[Our Newspaper] In the basketball league last night, in the two games of the A Division, Huili defeated Shanghai Police by 48 to 30, and Pfeiffer defeated Encas by 40 to 39. The winners of the first round have all become losers. In A Division 2B, Wuming defeated Hezhong by 36 to 32. Around 2,000 spectators were present and were very excited.

Huili has made considerable progress in recent games. They have effectively controlled the ball under the basket, and their shooting has also been exceptionally smooth. Last night's performance made the audience even more satisfied. Tian Fuhai's shooting and Wei Xu's presence under the basket were both quite fascinating. Shanghai Police seemed to be in trouble in the first half, and were even more powerless in the second half.

Huili's five players against Shanghai Police were Wei Xu, Tian Fuhai, Ye Yunshan, Wang Yongfang, and Cao Zhiji. The opponent responded with five young players: Shi Jiuquan, Wang Rongsheng, He Zeng, Wang Bowen, and Chuan Qixia. After the start of the game, He Zeng made special contributions on the edge. Huili Wei Xu responded with a goal, 9 to 4, and Huili's momentum was strong, leading 3 to 2. Lao Cao and Tian Wang scored a goal each, 9 to 4, and Huili's momentum was strong. Shanghai Police Yongbiao and Jiuquan were still surrounded on all sides. Huili continued to score with free throws, and soon increased to 14 points, while the opponent only had four points. Bowen, who had a reputation for accurate shooting, was also making sporadic moves there. After 18 to 4, Shanghai Police Yongbiao and Qixia found a few openings and added some energy. However, Huili Tian Wei and others were easy to get, and Shanghai Police was discouraged in the first half with a score of 26 to 17.

In the second half, Shanghai Police's lineup was Bowen, Jiuquan, He Zeng, Yongbiao, and Jin Gui. Huili remained unchanged. Bowen started the second half's record. Tian Fuhai's "Blessings as vast as the East Sea" single-handedly turned in, plus a free throw, adding vitality. Huili had a "red and purple" situation. Cao Zhiji's dribbling and rolling was another proud masterpiece. Shanghai Police seemed to be at the end of their strength. When the score was 40 to 22, the difference was already 18 points. Unexpectedly, Jin Gui scored three consecutive goals, and Bowen added color, completing eight points in one go, and hope was not lost. However, with only five minutes remaining, Rongsheng committed five fouls, and Liang replaced him. With the main player leaving, Shanghai Police became even more miserable. At 48 to 30, Huili avenged the first loss.

Wuming's Zhong Xinshun made a final effort, and finally won by a small margin of 36 to 32.

### Encas Protests One Point Loss: Pfeiffer Pleasantly Surprised

In the first game of Division A, Encas played Pfeiffer again. In the last game, Pfeiffer's Keller and Parks each scored a goal. Encas's Barto scored a basket and scored nine consecutive points. The teams went back and forth. In the first half, Pfeiffer was in a good mood, winning by two points with a score of 23 to 21. Soon afterwards, the score was tied at 26. Encas's Kejie, Mi Luo Fuxu, and Ao Chai Liao were out, and the score was confusing again. At the same time, everyone was guarding closely. Encas's guest player Barto (originally from the Meteorological Team) performed very well, with a natural shooting posture. In the last moment, Encas was still leading by one point. Unexpectedly, Pfeiffer broke through and Graych scored a goal, 40 to 39, causing Encas to protest endlessly. In the first round, Encas won by a large margin of 42 to 26.

### British Footballer Transfers for a Hefty Price of Tens of Thousands of Pounds

The story of transfers is an unavoidable phenomenon in the football world around the globe. However, the most surprising part for the fans must be in Britain, where it originated. According to local football league regulations: After June 36th each year, the registration of players for all teams is subject to strict restrictions. Simply put: Will the General Association accept it? Everything must be decided by the General Association. For this reason, before the start of each football season, especially the week before March 16th, the football world invisibly becomes a stunning market, and the transfer activity attracts much attention. From the current observation: The huge wave brewing this season is a rare record in football history. What will be the final price figure on the last day (June 1st)? No one can predict that. But according to the observation of authoritative circles, the highest figure may exceed the original record by thousands of pounds, which is undeniable. Based on the fluctuating situation: Since the start of poaching this season, there have been 30 transfers, and the price has reached five figures (Note: that is, tens of thousands). Among them, the one recognized as setting a world record is the "Derby County" team's purchase of "Zunni Morris" from the "Manchester United" team for £24,000. In addition, those exceeding £20,000 include "Eddie Kilsu" transferring from the "Bili Team" to the "Sheffield Team"; and "George Robado" transferring from the "Binsley Team" to the "New Wann Ziai Team."

In addition to the above-mentioned forwards with high transfer prices, there are also many others whose prices are around £18,000. Their names are as follows:

(1) "Anti Chang Nuo Shen" transferred from "Newcastle United" to "Fudu Bull Green," (2) "Anti Dang Nuo Shen" transferred from "Newcastle United" to "Sunderland," (salt) "Johnny Duoli" transferred from "Bailan Ford Team" to "Manchester United." In addition, the highest price for a center-back transfer also reached £17,500. The transfer was Welsh international player "Aihua Baohua Lu," who transferred from Queen's Pkar Ranger to "Aston Weixun Na"; the next highest was "Bailan Ford Team"'s captain and center-back "Ji Zhismos," who transferred to "Sheffield United" for £16,000; after that was "Birmingham Team"'s "Falan Mikecao," Birmingham gave the legendary center-back to "Dong Li Shi Team" for £15,000.

Speaking of defenders' transfers, the price is also quite surprising. Among them, the current record high is "Yi Yang Si Yaxian," an A Xiao Lan international player, who transferred from "Ci Lu Hua Shi Dong Te Team" to "Lutun City Team" for £10,000.

In summary, in this season's transfer market, the "Birmingham Team" is the most active. It spent a total of £58,000 to purchase six new players; conversely, it also earned considerable profits by letting go of three well-known players. In addition, the team that paid the highest price for transfer activities was the "Newcastle United Team," with a figure of £50,000; however, the profits from letting go of many players offset the cost. Secondly, the team that paid the highest price was the "Aston Wess" team, totaling £44,000.

### Praising Honest Officials

Zhang Qiqu

Recently, I read an article in a certain newspaper titled "Anecdotes of Honest Officials," which aroused infinite emotion.

The honest official mentioned refers to Mr. Jiang Shuge, the former director of the National Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. It is said that since this gentleman resigned from his official position and came to Shanghai when Sun Ke was the head of the Executive Yuan, he has been living in a humble inn, extremely poor. The business community in Shanghai is currently planning to help him make a living. I have never met this gentleman, and I heard his name for the first time, so there is no reason for me to promote him. However, if what the newspaper says is true, I think I have reason to promote him from the standpoint of an ordinary citizen.

In the minds of a group of people—especially young people—the words "honest official" have long become a historical term. Indeed, we hear and see too much news, talk, and behavior about corruption every day, which inevitably makes people feel that "all officials are corrupt, and no official is not greedy." In fact, there are often fragrant grasses within ten steps, let alone such a large government, it cannot be generalized. As far as I know, in the tax department alone, there have been two good officials who were absolutely honest. One was Director Li of the Luoyang Direct Tax Bureau, who died in office in the middle of the Anti-Japanese War. After his death, his inheritance was only more than 20 yuan in legal tender, which was enough to buy a foot of white cloth at the market price at that time. Later, everyone donated money for his burial; the other was the Director of the Guiyang Tax Bureau, who died at the end of the Anti-Japanese War. After his death, he was desolate and had no means to make arrangements, which was reported in the newspapers of the accompanying capital. When they were alive, who would believe that tax officials would have no money? Even if they dressed poorly, people would think that they were like Mr. Ma Er, pretending to be poor! But can people pretend, even to death, or even after death?

In the current government agencies in Shanghai, as far as I know, there are also many honest people. Because they are currently in office, I will not mention their names to avoid misunderstandings.

If we criticize corrupt elements with words and pens and think that they must be thoroughly purged, but only respond to honest people with a sigh, it is not only unfair, but also inappropriate, and it is also useless. Because today's corruption is due to the defects of economic, social, and political systems, and the deterioration of the atmosphere is obviously also an important factor. Some young people who scold corruption today will become experts in corruption when they enter society tomorrow. What is the reason for this? The social atmosphere is rewarding corruption and cultivating corruption.

Therefore, I believe that to eliminate corruption, it is better to praise honest officials effectively than to shout "kill" loudly. Praising honest officials is directly comforting good people and indirectly attacking bad people in a social sense; in an educational sense, it is praising goodness and setting an example for young people.

Of course, if our economic, political, and social systems are thoroughly and reasonably reformed so that honest officials can get more powerful and legitimate protection, it would be best; otherwise, if we listen to those who privately embezzle public funds and use their powers to intercede for their concubines, and let honest and public-spirited people be impoverished and neglected, I dare say that the consequences will be even more unimaginable.

### Strange Laws

— Zhong

In Berryville, California, USA, there is a law prohibiting pigeons from flying over the city, and those who violate it will be caught in nets.

In Homer, Illinois, only police officers are allowed to use rubber slingshots, and no one else may use them.

Massachusetts law stipulates that husbands may not set fire to their homes to drive out fierce wives.

Kansas law stipulates that the pickles sold in food stores must be able to bounce when thrown to the ground; those that cannot bounce may not be sold.

### Re-evaluating "Spring Thunder"

— Wang Ce

On the surface, "Spring Thunder" is a "romantic" and "charming" film, but at its core, it is a film with toxins and problems.

Let's take a look at the theme of "Spring Thunder." If the playwright emphasized the so-called "educating the second generation," in "Spring Thunder," Li Hanfen's beautiful and moving sermon is only to advocate for feudal society and to persuade Shen Manli for her husband's personal reproduction.

After Li Hanfen heard that her husband had died at sea, she did not hesitate to divide half of her family property, and she did not hesitate to condescend and endure humiliation to Shen Manli. In summary, she only wanted to leave this lineage and descendants for her rumored missing husband; such a narrow and selfish feudal concept's poison can still be spread publicly today, which is truly surprising. And the playwright uses the sugar coating of "educating the second generation" to cover up this unhealthy bacterium, and we are truly worried about today's Chinese film industry.

Secondly, in terms of character personalities, the playwright and director were completely unable to control it. Especially the role of Shen Manli, it is not clear what kind of person she is in terms of personality depiction. She seduced Pan Shuming's wound in public, even a prostitute should have some scruples; if she is a "socialite" and "social butterfly," after having physical relations with Pan Shuming, she is as pure as a saint, expressing that she does not want to accept any money from Pan Shuming. If Shen Manli is truly in love with Pan Shuming, but we see that the two are completely strangers before boarding the plane, it is not as "love at first sight" at all.

Finally, let's take a look at the situation of "Spring Thunder"'s blueprint, the enemy-puppet film "Competing for Spring."

"Competing for Spring" is a film produced during the enemy-puppet era. We cannot but admit that under the supervision of the enemy and puppets, they were a terrible bacterial team that spread poison and anesthetized the people. "Competing for Spring" should be banned, so what should be done with "Spring Thunder," which takes the story of "Competing for Spring" and is still full of anesthesia?

### Ancient Art Exhibition Room

— Mao Yi

In Peru, South America, near the ancient city of Nazca, American scientist Professor Paul Kosok recently discovered the world's largest art exhibition room.

This ancient giant art exhibition room is a 200-square-mile open-air sand desert, covered with huge statues of birds, spiders, plants, and multi-headed snakes. It is also the largest of the known astronomical charts. Countless straight lines and geometric figures drawn according to precise mathematics mark the movement of the sun, many of which are marked by rows of round pebbles embedded in the sand, which are not easily visible from the ground. Professor Kosok discovered this great achievement of the already vanished culture through aerial photography. The American Museum of Natural History estimates that these figures are about two thousand years old. Professor Kosok believes that some of those lines represent the movement of the stars. The secrets of many huge paintings remain unsolved to this day. The spider's figure clearly shows the various parts of the spider's body and its eight legs. The eagle's statue has a beak, claws, and tail, with its wings spread out, reaching 150 yards in length. Are they the totems of tribal nations? Are they religious symbols? Or are they trying to signal to the sun or the stars? These are all unsolved mysteries, waiting for modern scientists to conduct further exploration and research.

### Ode to a Strange Disease

— Qian Dacheng

Song Zhuang Jiyu's "Chicken Rib Chapter" says: "Xu, the wife of Meng Yu, the Participating Political Affairs Officer, had a strange disease. Every time it occurred upon hearing or seeing something, her whole body would tremble to the point of almost dying... She also hated hearing the surname Xu and the sound of silver and iron being struck. She could not bear to see any leftover money when buying things, nor did she want to keep a single penny. She once had a maid who had served her for more than ten years and was very capable, and she liked her very much. One day, she accidentally heard what the maid's family did for a living, and the maid said, 'Striking silver.' The disease also occurred, and she could no longer see her, and eventually drove her away..."

This kind of problem is indeed a strange disease. It is also strange for a woman to hate hearing her mother's surname. As for silver and iron, these two things are really hateful. If there were no iron in the world, wars would never happen; even if they did, they would not be so cruel. As for silver, it is even more hateful. How many people in ancient and modern times have suffered greatly from it. The sound of striking silver and iron that the lady heard, in fact, should not only be called a strange disease, but also a virtue. If everyone in the world was afraid of hearing the sound of striking silver and iron, wouldn't the world be peaceful? Unfortunately, now people, especially those in high positions, are launching wars to compete for coal and iron resources; and ordinary people, "when foreign money rings, their eyes become clear." When black eyeballs see silver coins, they are all extremely happy. The more silver coins, the better. The big heads are the best, and the small heads are not bad either. They will never be like that lady who "does not want to keep a single penny." Even Du Fu still had to "keep a penny to see." Wang Yifu never spoke of money in his life, only calling it "A Du," but in fact, he was still talking about money. However, now there are real knives and guns everywhere, and silver coins ring all over the street. If that lady lived today, she would not be able to live for a day.

I pray to God that all the ladies in the world are afflicted with this "strange disease," then the gentlemen will definitely be willing to be honest and selfless and yield to the country, and the world will be peaceful from now on! Therefore, I wrote "Ode to a Strange Disease."

That Prime Minister's wife, Xu, hated hearing the surname Xu, which I felt inexplicable when I first wrote this article, but it is actually a virtue. Because it proves that she will never ask her lord to employ her older or younger brothers. I suspect that Zhuang Jiyu's article is a fable. If there really was such a strange disease in the Song Dynasty, then I really regret why this good disease that can govern the country and make the world peaceful has not been passed down to this day! - Postscript.

### Art and Human Culture

— Shi Chongpeng

— For the Art Festival

Grosse's "The Origins of Art" says that the inner impulses of mankind produce intuitive aesthetic effects; Reinach's "Apollo's Art History" says that art is the crystallization of human labor; the former focuses on the spiritual, and the latter focuses on the material. In short, the creation of works of art is nothing more than the result of human spiritual and material activities.

Since mankind has produced works of art, let us look back at what benefits works of art have for human life? In the beginning, the art of primitive peoples mostly used the birds and animals of the time as themes, which were used to decorate the body and weapons, to boast of their own bravery, and to exert the effectiveness of tools; on the one hand, they were placed in caves to pray for the victory of hunting, which is how they gradually placed works of art in daily life. The people of Egypt and Mesopotamia left behind many great tomb arts, because at that time those people believed in eternal life and valued life after death as a happy life, and those "pyramids" and "high towers" were their lifelong endeavors, and at the same time, they gave their spirits something to rely on. The temples of the Greek people, the palaces of the Roman people, and the church buildings of the Middle Ages were all things that everyone needed at that time. As for the beginning of modern culture, that is, the European Renaissance, the arts in all aspects, whether architecture, sculpture, painting, or crafts, were brilliant, and the entire Huanzhou, and even the human life of the world, became more and more prosperous because of the development of art, and all cultures suddenly leapt forward, science gradually developed, commerce gradually developed, and human life and enjoyment have added a lot of happiness. Therefore, the "Renaissance," an epoch-making movement, has made the general public still miss this beautiful century, which is so great!

Let's talk about our Chinese nation again. It is one of the oldest national cultures in the world, along with Egypt, Mesopotamia, and India, and now only our Chinese nation can be called independent and complete, and is still continuing to thrive, inheriting the culture of its ancestors and creating a new culture for the future. The works of art of our ancestors have been scattered in major art museums around the world and are worshipped by them. That is, the Paris School, the world art center, the so-called post-impressionism, fauvism, and the recent abstract expressionism, are nothing more than the result of absorbing the line beauty of our country's painting, and abstract expressionism is even more involved in the abstract nature of our country's freehand brushwork and calligraphy. As a result, a chip of Qin brick and a corner of Han tile are also regarded as treasures; the paintings of the Tang and Song Dynasties have become priceless on the international market, and their position is becoming more and more prominent.

Therefore, when it comes to how we should inherit the glorious legacy of our ancestors in the future? And how to create a new road for the art of New China? On today's Art Festival, all of us in the art world must deeply reflect and strictly review. Today, we are standing in the midst of the chaos of war, and the lives of the people are extremely difficult. Seeing that art has been devastated, to the point where it is about to be unable to survive, we must save this crisis, and its significance is even more profound. Because if we investigate why the country has become so troubled, the main reason is the severe conflict in culture. The inherent culture has declined to the extreme since the Ming and Qing Dynasties, and it has never recovered. Moreover, it has been mixed with the uncoordinated destruction of Western culture, so that those who are engaged in cultural work each insist on their own views and reject each other. Those who are mild, criticize each other without cooperation; those who are fierce, resort to fighting and violence, ignoring the true value of inherent culture, and blindly importing unsuitable foreign cultures. In our art world, there are neither works that can surpass our predecessors, nor are there any works that have personality and represent the national Western art, so we are confused and do not know where to go. Learning from the past, we should, from now on, each writer be able to do his best to accept the elites of our country's art, and at the same time strive to absorb the strengths of Western art, concentrate our goals, and march in unison, then it will not be difficult to embark on a path of peace, unity, beauty, and brilliance.
