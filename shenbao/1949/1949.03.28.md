### Government Representatives to Fly to Beiping Regularly – Prepared with Sufficient Materials, No Plans Carried, Provisional Government Affairs Conference Postponed to Tomorrow

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] The government's delegation for peace talks has recently appointed Zhang Zhizhong as the chief representative and decided to fly to Beiping by special plane on the morning of the 31st to begin negotiations in Beiping starting on April 1st. Regarding the principles for negotiation when the delegation goes to Beiping, they will be based on Mao Zedong's eight conditions. In addition to preparing sufficient materials, they will not carry any plans; even the peace outline previously formulated by the government based on Mao Zedong's eight conditions will not be used for reference. Regarding the military reorganization plan, the government representatives have been discussing it in detail for several days. At 10:00 AM on the 27th, Premier He convened a meeting at the Ministry of National Defense to discuss the current situation on the various battlefields between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and the deployment of forces, etc., so that the representatives can understand. At 4:00 PM, Acting President Li also convened He Yingqin and the four representatives at the Chuanhougang Mansion to discuss other issues, such as resolving the technical issues of "war criminals," etc. The delegation members maintain absolute secrecy externally. However, when reporters inquired about the representatives' attitude towards the peace talks, they all revealed the following: "There is hope, but there are many difficulties, and it is even possible that the negotiations cannot continue when any problem is encountered." The bleakness of the future seems unavoidable, but the delegation is still determined to give it a try. In addition, when the representatives go to Beiping, each person can bring one secretary and one attendant. News reporters may be declined to accompany. Furthermore, it is recently heard that Xu Yuwen has been decided to be the Secretary-General of the Peace Talks Delegation because Li Suolong and Lei Zhen are not in Nanjing.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] The drafting of Premier He's overall administrative policy plan has not yet been completed. It was originally scheduled to be submitted to the Provisional Government Affairs Conference for discussion on the 28th, but it is already too late. The Government Affairs Conference has also been changed to be held on the afternoon of the 29th. In addition to discussing Premier Xu's administrative policy at the meeting, the organization, personnel, and funding of the peace talks delegation will also be determined. According to the National Organization Law, which was drafted by the former Executive Yuan and has already appointed staff, after research, it is planned to tighten the organization and change the staff.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] Acting President Li hosted a banquet for all members of the Control Yuan at the Presidential Palace on the afternoon of the 27th. In his speech, he expressed great satisfaction that the peace talks could begin soon, but said: The success of the peace talks depends on the efforts of the government and all parties. Acting President Li said: Peace is the unanimous hope of the people of the whole country. The people can no longer endure the suffering of war. If anyone does not want peace, they are violating the will of the people. He believes that the Chinese Communist Party will not be unwilling to have peace either. Acting President Li also recounted his efforts for peace, saying that when the situation in Nanjing was most tense and dangerous at the end of January, he still remained in Nanjing and was unwilling to go elsewhere, and finally was able to stabilize the situation. Acting President Li also said: This reorganization of the Executive Yuan, with the abolition of eight ministries and commissions and the merging of institutions, has been realized. The current government is moving towards democracy and believes that it can be gradually implemented. When Acting President Li hosted a banquet for all members of the Control Yuan on the afternoon of the 27th, Premier Yu, Deputy Premier Liu, and more than 90 members of the Control Yuan were invited to participate. After Acting President Li's speech, Control Yuan member Liang Shangdong stood up to give a response.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] Zhang Shizhao took the night train from Nanjing to Shanghai on the 27th and decided to return to Nanjing by night train on the 29th. Zhang replied to reporters' inquiries about his attitude towards the peace talks in an optimistic tone. When reporters asked whether the two sides would first discuss a ceasefire during this trip to Beiping, Zhang said: "In theory, it is right." Huang Shaohong is scheduled to come to Nanjing on the 28th.

### What is the Future of Peace Talks? General Opinion Believes That Reaching an Agreement is Possible, But it Will Only be an Intermittent Armed Truce

Reports from Foreign Correspondents

[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] All of China is watching the Kuomintang-Communist peace talks scheduled to begin on April 1st, with hope mixed with doubt. Many people are asking: "Is peace possible?" As far as cautious observers are concerned, they all put a question mark on the future of peace. At present, no one in the government or the opposition dares to predict the final outcome with certainty. However, as far as the inner feelings of most people are concerned, they all have Dr. Hu Shi's feeling that "peace is more difficult than war." However, it is generally believed that the possibility of some form of agreement is not non-existent, but even if an agreement is reached, at best it will only be a kind of intermittent armed truce, and it will never be permanent peace, because the Chinese Communist Party stubbornly adheres to its revolutionary goals and political ideals, and can only tolerate cooperators, not opponents. It is generally suspected that the Communist Party will be able to revise its final revolutionary goal—to eliminate all opponents and implement one-party dictatorship. The current situation is obviously different from the Marshall mediation period. The Chinese Communist Party is the master of the peace talks, and they are only willing to stop the war on their own terms. Obviously, the government is not unaware of the harshness of the Communist Party's conditions, just as Shao Lizi, the government's peace talk representative, said: During the period when the Communist Party insisted on the eight conditions, the future of the peace talks was not bright.

However, the current nationwide desire for peace is the main force in promoting peace talks. Zhang Zhizhong, the government's peace talk representative, believes that the power of public opinion may influence both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to restore their conscience and resolve the accumulated grievances and political differences of the past 20 years. Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have acknowledged the people's desire for peace in their communiqués. Many observers therefore believe that both sides are clearly unwilling to bear the responsibility for destroying peace. Once peace talks begin, both sides may be considered to have contributed to peace.

They also telegraphed overseas Chinese compatriots to unanimously advocate for the success of the peace talks.

### Remuneration of Public School Teachers and Staff Will Be Adjusted Rationally

The adjustment method has been researched by the Comptroller General, but Mr. Pang needs to receive the price indices from various places at the end of the month before he can determine the principles for adjusting various places. Therefore, it will not be possible to submit it at the Provisional Government Affairs Conference on the 29th. It will have to be discussed at the weekly meeting next week at the earliest.

### Wu Guozhen Impeached for Investigating Relief Supplies in the Northeast - Liu Zhe Believes He is Arrogant and Erratic, Tainting Official Morality

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] Liu Zhe, Vice President of the Control Yuan, previously had a dispute with Mayor Wu Guozhen in Shanghai regarding relief supplies in the Northeast. Liu has recently filed an impeachment case against Wu Guozhen for "roaring, being rude, arrogant, and erratic." However, it has not yet been established. The full text of Liu Zhe's impeachment case is recorded as follows:

Case: Mayor of Shanghai Wu Guozhen overstepped his authority and arbitrarily mortgaged 500 pieces of cotton yarn stored by the Committee for the Inventory and Disposal of Materials Remaining in the Interior from the Northeast at the Central Bank, borrowing 50 million yuan to allocate to refugees in the Northeast. On February 26 of this year, when attending the second investigation meeting convened by the Supervisory Office of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in Shanghai, he roared without etiquette, was arrogant and erratic, which is a violation of law and dereliction of duty, and taints official morality. It is proposed to file an impeachment in accordance with Article 97, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution.

Facts: (1) Abuse of power, arbitrarily mortgaging 500 pieces of cotton yarn from the Northeast Inventory and Disposal Committee at the Central Bank, borrowing 50 million yuan, and arbitrarily distributing it. On February 9 of this year, refugees from the Northeast appealed for relief funds, gathered at the Central Bank, waiting day and night. Mayor Wu Guozhen of Shanghai suddenly claimed that it was disrupting public order and affecting official duties, and arbitrarily mortgaged 500 pieces of cotton yarn from the Northeast Inventory and Disposal Committee at the Central Bank for 50 million yuan, and arbitrarily distributed it, isolating the real old and weak refugees outside the door, causing many to leave empty-handed. As a result, the refugees gathered at the China Industrial Bank of Shanghai and the Grain Emergency Procurement and Storage Association on February 11 and 12. Mayor Wu Guozhen used martial law and dispatched military police to forcibly disperse them. Since the mayor was able to dispatch military police to forcibly disperse them at the China Industrial Bank, why did he not take the same approach and apply it to the crowd at the Central Bank? If the Northeast Inventory and Disposal Committee could not dispose of this cotton yarn, what would be done? Conversely, since he was able to mortgage and distribute funds on behalf of the Central Bank, why did he forcibly disperse the refugees gathered at the China Industrial Bank and the Grain Procurement and Storage Association, sending military police? His handling is contradictory and oversteps his authority, which is very obvious. (2) Arrogant demeanor, loss of official morality, roaring without etiquette, obstructing the authority of this Yuan. This Yuan convened Liu Zhe and other eight Control Yuan members on February 15 to investigate this case. On February 6, at 3:00 PM, the second investigation meeting was convened at the Supervisory Office of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in Shanghai, inviting relevant personnel to attend. Mayor Wu Guozhen was as late as 4:40 PM, wearing a towel and entering the room arrogantly. After explaining the purpose of the invitation, Wu Guozhen's attitude was fierce, and he shouted loudly, first saying that this matter could not overstep his authority, and then repeatedly said that this matter relied on "Yang Chuoan's help for me," "using cotton yarn to help me," and "I consider it a political success"; it was truly roaring without etiquette, arrogant and erratic. When I asked Yang Chuoan, chairman of the Grain Procurement and Storage Association, whether this cotton yarn was issued to the municipal government or forcibly demanded by the municipal government for mortgage loans, before Yang Chuoan could finish answering, Wu Guozhen interrupted and said: "It was forcibly demanded by the municipal government, it was forcibly demanded by the municipal government." I said that it was overstepping his authority. Wu Guozhen also said: "It is overstepping his authority, it is overstepping his authority." The language was contradictory before and after, and the anger was unknown to what extent, it was truly disregarding the law and disciplining, and tarnishing official morality. I believe that the Control Yuan is the Control Yuan of the Republic of China, not the Control Yuan of individual Control Yuan members. How should Wu Guozhen attend the case and answer the defense, calmly and carefully study it, why wear a towel, roar without etiquette, be arrogant and erratic. It is proposed to send a letter to the Executive Yuan to give him a lesson and a reprimand, so that he can slightly restrain his arrogance in the future and cultivate a talent useful to the country. Respectfully proposed as right. Proposer: Liu Zhe.

### Communist Army May Launch Another Offensive Against the Bridgeheads North of the Yangtze River - To Provide the Greatest Assistance to Their Peace Talks

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] According to a certain authoritative military observer, the Communist Army may launch an offensive against other National Army bridgeheads north of the Yangtze River after advancing into Anqing. On the one hand, they want to deepen their military pressure during the peace talks, so that they can station troops on the banks of the Yangtze River to provide the greatest assistance to their peace talks. On the other hand, they also want to include all the bridgeheads north of the Yangtze River at this time so that they can carry out their conspiracy to cross the Yangtze River once the peace talks break down. The observer continued to say that the most polite approach of the Communist Army would be to reserve the bridgehead in the Jinpu area across the Yangtze River from the capital for the final attack. Others such as Yizheng, Guazhou, Sanjiangying, and Yuxikou will inevitably be attacked. However, the observer added that the above are all subjective plans and wishes of the Communist Army. Currently, the National Army is gradually strengthening the strength of the bridgehead positions north of the Yangtze River.

[Our Correspondent in Changshu, 27th] The situation in northern Jiangsu is becoming increasingly tense. Chen Yi's troops continue to move towards the Yangtze River. Field troops have been discovered in the Jintai area. A large number of wooden boats have gathered in the Nantong-Jingjiang area. The Bajianggang position is still safe.

[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 27th] Military News: (1) There is no change in the situation facing Yizheng, Guazhou, and the port. The National Army is firmly defending its original position. (2) More than 10,000 Communist troops from the Central China Field Army in northern Jiangsu, including more than 7,000 civilian laborers, arrived in the suburbs of Yangzhou from Lianghuai yesterday. (3) Five columns of Chen Yi's troops have now advanced to the vicinity of Jingjiang. Sniping battles have occurred continuously near the National Army bridgehead position near Bajianggang. The Communist Army has also fired artillery to demonstrate.

### Anqing Navy and Army Counterattack - Communist Troops Who Sneaked to the Riverbank Completely Annihilated - Chen Geng's Troops in Eastern Hubei Retreat to Luotian Northwest to Build Fortifications

[Our Correspondent in Wuhu, 27th] The Anqing offensive and defensive battle has entered its fourth day since it began on the 23rd, but the urban area is still firmly defended by the National Army. In addition to the 174th Division of the 46th Army and some local teams stationed in the urban area and two warships on the river, another strong navy force, formerly known as Yang Zheng's troops, which has always been known for its bravery and good fighting, Yang Gancai's troops, arrived on the morning of the 26th and immediately launched a fierce counterattack on the western strongholds outside the city in conjunction with the original garrison. The fierce battle lasted until noon, killing and wounding more than 2,000 Communist troops and capturing more than 100. From the afternoon onwards, the National Army took the opportunity to adjust its deployment, and the battle situation temporarily turned silent. In addition to the two armies of the 11th and 12th Corps and a backbone regiment originally found to belong to Chen Geng's establishment, the Communist Army also launched a fierce attack on the National Army's positions after reinforcing the 21st Army on the evening of the 26th. After a night of fierce fighting, they were finally repelled completely on the morning of the 27th. Around noon today, the Communist Army launched a general attack from the east, west, and north sides of the city. One group of about 200 to 300 people even sneaked to the riverbank at Dingjia Village (East Gate) of Congyang Mountain, but ultimately relied on the three-dimensional fire network formed by the navy and air force and the ground garrison, and completely annihilated the group of Communist troops. As of 8:00 PM tonight, the National Army has firmly defended its original positions from Duantang Lake in the east of the city, passing through Wulidun, Longyimiao, Agricultural School, and Phoenix Mountain, to Shimen Lake in the west. In addition, Anqing's external telecommunications and transportation are still smooth. Ships have departed from Hankou and headed east through Anqing both yesterday and today.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] According to the Navy Headquarters, the Anqing battle is still in intense progress. It was silent due to rain on the 26th, but it turned fierce again in the evening and has not stopped as of the evening of the 27th. At noon on the 27th, a group of more than 200 Communist troops sneaked to the riverbank in the eastern suburbs, using the river embankment as cover, and engaged in artillery battles with naval vessels parked on the river. The Communist troops were blocked from advancing into the city due to the fierce naval artillery fire. Therefore, they sneaked to the riverbank in an attempt to intercept the navy. After the navy discovered the target, it completely wiped out the Communist troops with a fierce fire network. Currently, naval vessels are still exerting their power to continue to support the garrison's operations.

[Our Correspondent in Huangpi, 27th] Military News: The 13th Army of the 4th Corps of Chen Geng's troops, which was defeated and retreated from Macheng, shot dead a regimental commander surnamed Li who had fought ineffectively when it retreated to Gaojiadian, 55 li southeast of Macheng, yesterday. According to a report from returned prisoners, the regimental commander was a member who had carried weapons and surrendered to the Communist Army from the National Army's position south of Xuzhou. It is also learned that most of the Communist troops have retreated to the Luotian northwest area to build fortifications, and they do not seem to have forgotten Macheng.

### The So-Called World Peace Congress

The Congress for World Peace, initiated by the American Association of Artists, Scientists, and Professional Personnel, opened in New York on the evening of the 25th of this month. The scheduled duration is three days, and issues concerning world peace, such as the Cold War between the East and West, the Marshall Plan for European aid, the control of atomic energy, and the Atlantic Pact, are all on the agenda for discussion. If the purpose of this meeting is truly to gather the wisdom of scientists, artists, and educators from various countries around the world to explore a broad path to world peace, it would undoubtedly be a kind of peace movement of international significance today. However, the original initiator, the American Association of Artists, Scientists, and Professional Personnel, has been listed as an organization of the communist front in the investigation and statistical records of the US Attorney General. The representatives of various countries are mostly left-wing figures. Before its opening, the Soviet Union and the countries within its iron curtain sent telegrams of support, going to great lengths to promote it. Because of this biased stance, people cannot believe that this is a truly impartial world peace congress purely initiated by the people. The US State Department has frankly pointed out that this meeting will open a convenient door for Soviet propaganda; New York Governor Dewey also said that this meeting is a matter of the communist front.

Therefore, before the opening of this meeting, the US refusal to allow representatives from certain countries to enter caused unpleasant emotions internationally. After the opening of the congress, the many difficulties caused by right-wing figures in the United States, and even the American Committee for Cultural Freedom holding a counter-meeting in New York, made New York a propaganda battlefield for the East-West Cold War. The congress for defending peace is itself not peaceful. As a result, it will not only be of no help to maintaining world peace, but it may also only increase international disturbances. Why has it come to this? The biggest reason is probably the lack of participation of great religious figures, especially the lack of Buddhist virtues of "great compassion for all beings" who can personally advocate for it. Only the spirit of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas who take "equality and benefit to all sentient beings" as their vocation and "if I don't go to hell, who will?" as their vow can truly eliminate national boundaries, eliminate racial boundaries, and create a new world full of harmony.

However, let's get back to the point. In today's low international pressure, if someone comes out to advocate for peace, attempting to gather the consciousness of all mankind to work towards defending peace, regardless of their motives or whether they are being directed by others, and standing on the premise of mutual tolerance and avoiding the catastrophe of war, they are worthy of welcome and encouragement from the world. Congress Chairman Shapley said: "I come here with the most humble heart to ask a simple question: How can humanity live in peace?" The US government authorities, knowing that this meeting is directed behind the scenes by the Comintern, still allowed the meeting to open as scheduled in New York, allowing representatives from various countries to speak freely in the meeting. This democratic demeanor is truly worthy of praise by peace-loving and freedom-loving people all over the world. We hope that the government of any region can be like the United States, allowing free and open discussion conferences. Whether or not it is democratic should be judged from these examples. Standing on the sidelines, we sincerely hope that the representatives of all countries can calmly review the crux of world problems, and with an attitude of "no preconceived notions, no absolute judgments, no stubbornness, no ego," thoroughly exchange opinions, gather the wisdom of all people, and truly explore a broad path to world peace, and by no means add fuel to the increasingly fierce Cold War. We believe that the Congress for the Defense of Peace must meet the following two prerequisites, otherwise, it cannot be regarded as a peace movement of international significance today.

First, the desire for peace is the common psychology of the people of all countries in the world; creating a fair and lasting peace is the unanimous demand of the people of all countries in the world. Even in the case of the United States and the Soviet Union, no matter how different the ideologies of the two countries, how different the political systems, how conflicting the interests, and how intense the Cold War between the two sides, the people of both countries originally hoped for peace, and aversion to war is truly a common sentiment. The people of other countries, having suffered the catastrophe of two world wars in thirty years, are even more "pale at the mention of war." However, judging from the current international situation, it must be admitted that it is moving towards the road to war, and the crisis of a new international war is becoming increasingly urgent, with a tendency to erupt at any moment, making the psychology of the people of any country feel threatened. Therefore, at a time when the crisis of a third world war is deepening, it is a good thing if someone comes out to advocate for peace. However, convening any form of international peace conference should have a peaceful atmosphere in itself. If it is used as a propaganda offensive, so that the meeting is filled with violence, it will not only be of no help to world peace, but will also create a tense international situation. Congress Chairman Shapley has stated that the representatives will be able to hold the meeting in the "spirit of democratic tradition." We would like to especially remind the representatives of all countries to never forget this golden rule of the initiator, Professor Shapley, otherwise, this congress will inevitably become a second World Congress of Intellectuals held in Poland last August, which will not only be of no help to international peace, but will also cause international disputes and controversies.

Second, the factors for the failure of creating peace after the war are very complex, and they are by no means caused solely by one aspect. Even Congress Chairman Shapley admits that the United States and the Soviet Union are both at fault for the current international stalemate. In the propaganda war between the United States and the Soviet Union, we can hear the mutual shirking and blame everywhere. On the American side, it is often said that the Soviet Union's power is constantly developing to Western Europe, the Middle East, and the Far East, with a tendency to be omnipresent, and world peace has been threatened by communist forces. If measures are not taken to prevent it, Western Europe, the Middle East, and the Far East will fall into the iron curtain. Therefore, it advocates actively assisting European countries and initiating the conclusion of the Atlantic Pact to maintain regional security. But on the Soviet side, it is said that the United States is a war-monger, using the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan to create a new international war, and the conclusion of this Atlantic Pact is leading the world to war. The arguments of both sides seem to have their own reasons, and it is truly "this is right, and that is wrong." But if one stands on the sidelines, it is not difficult to say a fair word. As long as both sides have great politicians who are thinking about the people of the whole world, abandon subjective prejudices, and are not blinded by the gains and losses of the small self, then it is not impossible to transform hostility into harmony between the world's two major groups.

The people who talk about peace the most in the world are undoubtedly devout Buddhists. The most important thing in Buddhism is to persuade people that "resentment should be resolved, not perpetuated." If you want to resolve knots, you can only persuade and guide, not act as a judge. If the World Peace Congress does not start from this point, but insists on using the method of a "public judgment meeting" to first comment on who is right and who is wrong, I am afraid that it will be called defending world peace, but the result may deepen the crisis of war. Therefore, we feel that in the world peace movement, instead of relying solely on the Western way of thinking, arguing from the legal concept of right and wrong, it is better to add more of the Eastern way of thinking, from the standpoint of religious figures, and use compassion to persuade authoritative politicians, which will be more effective. The success or failure of peace talks in China also depends on this.

### Existing Stocks Are Sufficient to Meet Needs Xinjiang Will Issue Silver Coins Casting Work Will Be Ready Soon

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 27th] The new provincial government is actively preparing to issue silver coins to solve the serious economic problems it is currently encountering. It is reported that the relevant departments are currently installing coin-making equipment, and the preparation work has been 54% completed, and it will be fully completed by the end of the month.

### Unilateral Modification of the Western Border of Germany Germans Unanimously Express Protest Consider This Act a Violation of the Atlantic Charter

[United Press, Washington, 26th] The United States, Britain, and France jointly announced today that they would revise the western border of Germany. Thirty-one areas of German territory, covering 52 square miles, with a population of 13,500 residents, will be ceded to the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Saar Autonomous Region, and France, respectively, to improve transportation and management. This is the second change in the western border of Germany, the first being the autonomy of the Saar region. The border revision resolution is the result of months of meetings in Paris by the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, Luxembourg.

[Agence France-Presse, The Hague, 26th] According to well-informed sources, the formal agreement to revise the western border of Germany has been announced tonight, but the details will not be made public for two or three weeks to avoid smuggling activities and unexpected delays for residents. According to unofficial sources, the border to be revised in the Netherlands affects an area of a dozen kilometers long, located in the east of Nijmegen and in the Sittard enclave. These revisions only correct some unreasonable locations in the old border that are related to roads and wood roads.

[United Press, London, 27th] Radio Moscow broadcast today a German News Agency report stating that the decision of the United States, Britain, and France to cede 52 square miles of German land to the Netherlands, France, the Saar, Belgium, and Luxembourg is actually a seizure of German territory. The so-called administrative, transportation, and technical difficulties are just self-deception.

[Agence France-Presse, Düsseldorf, 26th] Political leaders in West Germany issued strong protests against the joint communiqué issued by the Allies stating that they would make some adjustments to the western border of Germany. A communiqué issued by the Rhineland government expressed extreme disappointment that the Western democratic groups did not grant the German people the right to self-determination, and stated that this act indicated that the countries had violated the provisions of the Atlantic Charter. The communiqué also stated that the Western Allies took this action by taking advantage of the fact that Germany could not exercise its powers internationally. This kind of cession of political and economic interests is a major blow to the spirit of forming a free Europe. Dr. Adenauer, Chairman of the German Parliament in Bonn, said that the Allied decision was a step backward on the road to European federation. A spokesman for the executive committee of the Social Democratic Party declared that this behavior by the West would give the Communist Party a good excuse to make equal or greater concessions in East Germany. Germany will never approve of this unilateral decision to change. Germany's democratic forces have been dealt a very heavy blow by Hitler's acts of aggression.

### Washington Deploys a Three-Foreign Ministers Conference to Discuss West Germany's Problems; US Disagreements on Occupation Regulations

The West German conference will likely be held immediately after the signing. The focus of the meeting will be on economic cooperation issues in the three occupation zones of West Germany.

Other issues include: (1) Drafting occupation regulations to govern the relationship between the occupying powers and the future German central government. The United States advocates granting the German government maximum freedom, while France wants to maintain the supreme authority of the Allied military government. (2) The division of powers between the German central government and local governments. Britain and the United States support centralism, while France advocates expanding the powers of local governments. (3) The Berlin blockade, seeking all possible ways to break the blockade. (4) Reparations issues. The Economic Cooperation Administration proposed reducing the number of German factories to be dismantled several months ago, but Britain and France did not accept it. (5) Banning and restricting German industries. The United States advocates easing bans and restrictions. These issues will not be fully resolved at the meeting, but only principles can be agreed upon, and representatives of the three foreign ministers will continue to meet to discuss the details.

He replied that he had not eaten, so the maid said: I will fry some eggs for you. In this way, she went to the kitchen to fry eggs, leaving the guest alone in the living room. After the eggs were fried and sent to him, he sat for a while, and the man suddenly said: I have some things to do, I will go out for a while and come back. When he walked out the door, he repeatedly urged the maid to accept the suitcase when it was delivered, and the maid agreed. Unexpectedly, the man left and never returned, and no suitcase was delivered. When the son of the celebrity returned home in the evening, the maid told him about this, and he was very surprised, because there was no friend from Hong Kong who called him during the day, but he didn't take it to heart. There was no talk for one night, and when he got up to brush his teeth in the bathroom the next morning, he found that two tubes of toothpaste were missing in the kitchen. He also saw a camera and a case stuffed in the kitchen, so he rushed to check in the bedroom, and found that a Contax and a Rolleiflex camera were missing. The alarm clock on the table and the change in the drawer were also stolen. Also, a few days ago, in a residence in the western district, when the master was out, a car suddenly drove to the door. There was a man and a woman in the car. The man was in a suit and leather shoes, with a gentlemanly air, and the woman was in a gray mink coat, elegant and luxurious. At that time, the man got out of the car and asked: Is so-and-so at home? The maid replied that they were all out. The man expressed his disappointment, and seeing a child playing in the room, he said to the child: Do you still recognize me? Then he took the opportunity to sit down and play with the child with a smile. After sitting for a while, he suddenly frowned and said that his stomach hurt, and said that he had been suffering from dysentery these days and had to go to the toilet immediately. The maid immediately led him to the toilet upstairs to defecate. He came downstairs a few minutes later and continued to play with the child. After a while, his stomach suddenly hurt again. This time he went upstairs to the toilet by himself, and the maid did not accompany him. After coming downstairs, he sat for a while,

got in the car and left. When the master returned home that night, he found that dozens of US dollars, a ring, and some other odds and ends in the bedroom drawer had been stolen. It is said that many residents in the western district have encountered this kind of theft, and the theft gangs have inquired very clearly about the names of the residents who are the targets of the theft, as well as their living conditions, before using their theft tricks when they are not at home. In general, the maids of upper-class families must pay attention to and be wary of these well-dressed and brazen thieves.

### Public and Private School Teachers Face Desperate Living Conditions: Teachers' Monthly Salary as Low as Just Over 1,000 Yuan; Joint Petition Group Submits Six Demands

[Report from Our Newspaper] The "Shanghai Public and Private School Principals and Teachers Groups Joint Petition Delegation" hosted reporters and people from all walks of life at the Daxia University Club in Xinhuaxincun, Nanjing West Road, yesterday morning to discuss the livelihood issues of teachers. This organization is composed of units such as the Shanghai Secondary Education Research Association, the Primary School Teachers Joint Continuing Education Association, the Municipal School Teachers Welfare Promotion Association, the Private School Principals Symposium, and the Teachers Fellowship. Because teachers and colleagues feel that their lives have reached a dead end and are on the verge of starvation, unable to live and unable to die, they believe that the government should not turn a blind eye. In order to save the current precarious education situation, in addition to urging the government to increase the percentage of education funding, they also request the government to implement the following requirements:

(1) Immediately issue private school teachers a subsidy of ten silver dollars per person; (2) Immediately issue private school teachers a loan of ten silver dollars per person; (3) Immediately restore the special allocation of one dou of rice per person per month; (4) The salaries of municipal school teachers must be issued in full according to their base salary without discounts, based on the monthly price index; (5) Maintain in-kind distribution, and restore the allocation of eight dou of rice. Arrears of cooking oil and coal briquettes should be issued immediately. If cash is converted, it should be calculated at the current retail market price; (6) Quickly issue three months' salary as emergency funds. The first three items are for the private school section, and the latter three items are for the municipal school section. After preparing a petition, it will be formally submitted to the government authorities in the coming days. They believe that these six points are the minimum requirements to solve the current difficulties of teachers in public and private schools in this city, and hope that colleagues in public and private schools throughout the city will unite and work hard to achieve them. The joint petition group is currently launching a widespread signature campaign, and it is said that more than 4,600 people had signed by the evening of the 26th. Tai Shuangqiu, Chen Bochui, and University Professor Xu Jie, all from the education sector who attended yesterday's reception, also spoke to express their support for their demands.

### Recent General Treatment of Public and Private School Teachers

Regarding the current treatment of public and private teachers, a report was given at yesterday's reception: According to a survey of 3,056 teachers' salaries in private schools, the highest salary was 40,000 yuan for only one person, and the lowest was only 1,300 yuan for six people. The average salary was between 11,000 and 20,000 yuan, and teachers had to take care of their own meals. The average base salary of municipal primary school teachers is 140 yuan. 225 times this amount was issued in March, but after discounts, they only received 17,100 yuan, which is equivalent to about four dou of rice. Recently, the municipal government will issue another 675 times this amount, which will amount to 51,300 yuan, but the price of rice has already exceeded 75,000 yuan.

### Neighborhood Head Flees with Family After Stolen Oil Found in Home

The Xinjing Police Sub-bureau recently received a tip-off stating that a large amount of stolen oil was hidden at No. 6 Wujia Lane, south of the airport. On the 25th, Yang Jingwen, the head of the Criminal Division, ordered police officers to investigate. It was learned that the resident was the home of Wang Zhongming, the neighborhood head.

The next morning, the police officers in charge continued to go there, but unexpectedly, the whole family had fled. The oil was then transported back to the bureau, and an arrest warrant was issued for the fugitive Wang Zhongming for investigation.

### Policeman on Duty on Huashan Road Beaten and Seriously Injured with Broken Bones

[Report from Our Newspaper] A Letian Teahouse at the intersection of Huashan Road and Hengshan Road in West Shanghai, which performs Shanghai opera, is quite popular. At around 1 p.m. yesterday, two policemen and one soldier had a verbal altercation due to a shoulder bump on the escalator. They then resorted to violence and dispersed. Before long, the soldier returned to his unit and led a large group of soldiers, all armed with rifles and Thompson submachine guns. They first surrounded the teahouse, and some went upstairs to search for the two policemen but could not find them. They then went to a nearby police booth and inquired about the whereabouts of policeman Zhang Tiegen, number 8010, who was on duty. Zhang replied that he had not seen them, which angered them and they thought he was intentionally protecting them. They immediately grabbed him and used iron bars and other weapons to break two of his ribs. They also seized his service pistol and armed belt and headed south along Xujiahui Road, remembering the bridge and towards Xietu Road. After receiving the report, the Xujiahui Police Sub-bureau dispatched a large number of armed police officers, led by Deputy Bureau Chiefs Chen Zhengming and Wang Lixian, to investigate the truth. At that time, most of the police officers were indignant, but Chief Chen tried his best to stop them, claiming that he would be responsible for negotiating with the commander of the troop and demanding the return of the seized firearms and other items. The police officers then returned to the bureau. Chief Chen then consulted with the 3rd Garrison Brigade to send personnel to negotiate with the troop. As of 8 p.m., the issue had not been resolved.

### China Aviation Struggles and Loses Three Cities; Railway Team Ascends to New Throne; Gentle Breeze and Sunny Day at Yiyuan Stadium Attract Ten Thousand Spectators

[Report from Our Newspaper] The new champion of this year's football league was born yesterday. The Railway team overcame China Aviation by a score of three to zero amidst the sound of firecrackers, completing this year's masterpiece.

Throughout the entire match, China Aviation's offense was better than its defense, while the Railway team's defense was better than its offense, so the two sides were evenly matched. China Aviation's forward had a Gao Xiuqing, and the Railway team's defender had national player Gao Baozheng. The offense and defense of the two teams were well balanced. Although the Railway team won by a clean three goals, in reality, only the third goal can be considered truly solid. China Aviation's loss of the first two goals was due to a 20-yard penalty kick and an own goal. If the loss of the third goal was not so decisive, I would have truly felt sorry for China Aviation.

Furthermore, yesterday's final, although not particularly exciting or high-level, was tense and stimulating. In this cold and lonely Shanghai football scene, it was still a football match worth watching. Because the weather was sunny and the sun was shining, and the audience realized that the football season was coming to an end, Yiyuan was unprecedentedly lively, with a crowd of more than 10,000 people.

After the game, Mayor's Representative Zhang Peter held the award ceremony on the spot. Yesterday, 1,146 tickets were sold for 1,200 yuan each, and 4,046 tickets were sold for 800 yuan each, for a total revenue of 4,612,000 yuan. The referee was Zhang Le, and the linesmen were Ni Xiaoben and Lu Shunde.

Yesterday's game started at 3:00 p.m. China Aviation kicked off and attacked, but the attack was intercepted. The Railway team's army concentrated in China Aviation's territory, and the technique was trampled. Xie Xichuan inadvertently fouled, and Xiao Ziwen took a free kick, powerfully hitting the net and scoring the first goal. China Aviation was unwilling to give in and launched a full-scale attack. Xu Zuguo's low shot from 15 yards failed. Gao Xiuqing suddenly shot forcefully, but the ball hit the crossbar and bounced down. Liao Xiong was about to catch it, but Yin Qingbing arrived like lightning and was judged to have fouled by hitting him in the face. Not long after being penalized, Yin Qingbing kicked the ball high into the middle. Xu Zuguo flashed in, but was just a hair's breadth away from success, again in vain. After a long and fierce battle, Yin Qingbing dribbled the ball forward, and Gao Baozheng collided with him head-on. Yin was injured and fell to the ground, leaving the field for treatment. The first half ended there. After a lemon break, they put on their jerseys again. Jin Jiabiao from China Aviation volunteered to help and replaced Shang Huajun. The Railway team became more and more courageous, and China Aviation initially showed signs of being unable to withstand the pressure. Xu Zuguo and Chen Yuwei exchanged positions, but it did not help the overall situation. The Railway team took the opportunity to attack, and the penalty area of China Aviation was full of dangers. The Railway team's central three forwards attacked in tandem. Xu Fusheng rushed out, Jin Chuanhan cleverly displayed his skills, and Wu Binghao had a moment of inspiration and touched the ball into the net, picking up an extra point. China Aviation gradually became exhausted, and although they fought like trapped beasts, they were already at a disadvantage. At 36 minutes, Wu Binghao had a chance to cross the ball, Lu Qingxiang headed it to the middle, and Zhang Jie slid to the ground and scooped it in, scoring another goal. After that, the battle gradually came to an end. When the silver whistle blew, the Railway team won the Mayor's Cup by a score of three goals.

### Qunli and Jingwu Draw with Three Goals Each

Yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m., Qunli and Jingwu met at Yiyuan for a second round robin match. The referee was Zhu Qiu, and the linesmen were Zhang Zhiren and Li Guoyi. After the start of the game, Qunli's Yao Jihua made a clever pass to Ruan Longsheng, and forward Chen Longquan scored the first goal. Not long after, Lu Fangkui cut in and Chen Longquan scored again. Wu Jingren passed to the left wing and Fang Jiqiu shot into the left corner, pulling back a goal for Jingwu. Zhao Yongfang committed a handball outside the 30-yard line, and Wu Jingren took the free kick, which hit the target again, making the score 2-2. But in the blink of an eye, Lu Fangkui shot in the midst of the chaos and scored another goal, ending the first half with a score of 3-2. After a short break, the two sides fought again. Wu Jingren passed to the middle, and Wang Guoguang dribbled straight into the penalty area, making the score 3-3. Afterwards, although both sides had the intention of scoring, they lacked the skill to shoot. When the statutory time expired, the two sides drew with three goals each.

### Green Team Defeats Strong Rival Li Team Twice; Dominates the Women's League; Huili Continues Winning Streak, Defeats Peifeier

[Report from Our Newspaper] Last night's basketball league program was quite appealing, with an audience of around 3,000 people. In the women's main game, the Green team defeated the Li team again by a score of 48-31, winning all seven games and showing the demeanor of a dominant team. In the Men's Division One game, Huili's victory over Peifeier was also a fierce battle, resulting in a score of 56-45, with a score of 30-18 in the first half. Huili has won three consecutive games and is on a winning streak. In Men's Division Two A, Donghua defeated Youyi, 64-42.

Huili established its dominance within five minutes with a score of 10-4, making the foreign soldiers run around in exhaustion. The double-teaming of Wang Yongfang and Tian Fuhai established the foundation in the first half, and Peifeier was unable to accelerate in the second half.

In the women's main game between the Green team and the Li team, the Li team's defenders guarded their respective zones in the first quarter, making it difficult for the Green team to attack, and both sides seemed to be somewhat abnormal. After the second quarter, the Green team developed more evenly. Although Qian Chuping of the Li team scored as many as 23 points, she could not avoid defeat again.

The game between Youyi and Donghua in Men's Division Two A had a relaxed atmosphere. Youyi remained calm despite being in a losing position. Donghua has won all four games.

Last night, a "business runner" patronized the gymnasium. A certain gentleman's fountain pen on the press seat was almost stolen, which was also a brief interlude in the game.

### Review of the Railway vs. China Aviation Game

— Football Historian

The Mayor's Cup final was repeatedly postponed due to rain, and it was finally performed yesterday afternoon, attracting more than 10,000 spectators. China Aviation showed strong fighting spirit at the beginning of the game, and its defense was further strengthened by the return of Zhuang Wenquan. The forwards had commendable speed, but the weakness was in the midfield line. Regardless of assisting in offense or defense, they were inadequate. Jin Chuanhan performed above his usual standard and worked quite hard, and it can be said that he did his best, but he cannot shirk the blame for the second goal conceded. Chen Xiaoping had not fully recovered from his foot injury and worked diligently despite the pain, but this affected his speed. Shang Huajun was still competent. In the second half, Jin Jiabiao was substituted in. He had just returned from Dien Bien Phu, so he was unfamiliar with the game. In the first half, Xiao Gao and Yin Qingbing constantly fell back to defend and dribble the ball, so the disconnection in the midfield line was not very obvious. After Yin Qingbing was injured in the second half, his mobility was greatly reduced, and Xiao Gao also showed signs of exhaustion, so the front and back were weakened. Li Shunsheng and Chen Yuwei on the two wings still need to improve. In all fairness, China Aviation lost three goals that they should not have lost. The first goal was a free kick taken by Xiao Ziwen. Xu Fusheng was positioned too far to the right and did not defend Xiao Ziwen's quick shot to the left, conceding the first goal, which affected the morale of the soldiers. The second goal was caused by a misunderstanding between Jin Chuanhan and Xu Fusheng. Jin thought that Xu would rush out, but Xu did not. When Xu Fusheng rushed out, Jin Chuanhan happened to touch the ball with his abdomen, and Xu Fusheng failed to catch it, and Wu Binghao followed up and picked up an extra point. The third goal showed that the Railway team's forwards cooperated tacitly, but it was also due to China Aviation launching a full-scale attack, resulting in loopholes in the defense. In the second half, Chen Yuwei and Xu Zuguo exchanged positions, which did not help at all. On the contrary, there was no threat in the middle at all.

Looking at the overall strength of the two teams, the Railway team is certainly stronger, but miracles often happen in cup matches. Qingbai's tragic elimination is an example of this. However, the only way for China Aviation's forwards to win is to rely on speed. Gao Xiuqing is the leader among them. Yin Qingbing sometimes performs outstandingly and sometimes fades into obscurity. I still remember that during last year's National Games, Yin represented the Navy and played against Hong Kong. He scored a goal alone, but five minutes before the end of the game, Hong Kong equalized. In overtime, the Chinese team defeated the Navy. Yin was particularly determined in that game, but he could not maintain his normal state. If he practices diligently, he has a promising future. Goalkeeper Xu Fusheng performed very well. If it were not for his extraordinary efforts, China Aviation would have lost more than that.

The Railway team's Liao Xiong was particularly outstanding and saved many sure-fire goals. Gao Baozheng was stationed in the center, making it difficult for the Hu cavalry to cross Yinshan Mountain. The central defenders all had a steady performance. The central three forwards had tacit understanding in their movements and advanced quickly, often breaking into the enemy's formation with a fan-shaped offensive. Xiao Ziwen's penalty kick secured the victory, and Zhang Jie's darting and Lu Qingxiang's passing all showed superior skills. The only shortcomings were that the two wings were weaker. Wu Binghao only lacked speed, but his old skills were still there. Lin Dianxi only had the skill of going straight forward and passing the ball in front of the goal. In yesterday's game, Lin had a chance to score within only seven or eight yards in front of the goal, but he failed to score. He hesitated and could not make a decision, which was the biggest mistake. The whole team was full of energy, tireless in long battles, and cooperated well. Qingbai's unexpected defeat this time strengthened the confidence of the Railway team and allowed them to win the Mayor's Cup. If Qingbai's generals do not cheer up in the second round robin match, when the two heroes meet, the outcome is still unpredictable.

### Jia Tong Highway Overturn Accident: Driver's Oil-Saving Practice Caused the Disaster; Female Passenger Zheng Zhuling Died

[Our Jiaxing, 25th Report] Following the tragic bus accident on the Jia Tong Highway on January 10th of this year, a similar incident occurred again on the 17th of this month. In the former case, passengers Xu Xuechu and another were crushed to death on the spot. In the latter, one female passenger, Zheng Zhuling, died. The two accidents were only 68 days apart, and the cause of both was careless driving by the bus drivers. The driver in the Xu case, Li Sibin, fled for fear of punishment and has not yet been apprehended. The driver in the Zheng case, Li Youhai, has been detained by the Tongxiang County Police Bureau and is currently being interrogated by the County Judicial Office. However, the Provincial Highway Bureau has not made any statement regarding these two tragic accidents. It is rumored that the Bureau has been actively lobbying various parties in recent days, attempting to exonerate the drivers responsible for the accidents. Residents of He and Tong counties are outraged upon hearing this, believing that the Provincial Highway Bureau is not considering disciplining bus drivers, thoroughly repairing road surfaces, or improving vehicles, but only seeking its own benefit. Such disregard for human life, in addition to the criminal responsibility of the drivers themselves for causing death through professional negligence, the Provincial Highway Bureau authorities should bear full responsibility for the Xu and Zheng tragedies. It is now reported that the Tongxiang County Party Secretary Chang Tonglun, Speaker Zhu Fen, and family members of the deceased passengers Xu Xueshuan and Zheng Guochang are initiating the organization of a Xu Zheng Tragedy Support Association and are personally planning to go to Hangzhou to petition the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the Highway Bureau, the Ministry of Communications Office, the High Court, and other relevant agencies. At the same time, they are collecting detailed information about the overturn accident on the 17th, providing factual evidence, and appealing to all sectors of society to uphold justice. According to reports, the accident site was not on a bridge but on a flat roadside about four or five meters wide. Inspection of the overturned vehicle's components revealed that they were intact. The cause of the accident was clearly due to careless driving and excessive speed. It is rumored that the Provincial Highway Bureau adopts an "oil quota system" for its bus drivers, meaning that drivers are given a certain amount of gasoline per kilometer traveled, with any surplus going into the driver's pocket and any shortfall being covered by the driver themselves. Therefore, drivers drive as fast as possible and frequently turn off the engine and coast in neutral to save gasoline, which is the biggest cause of accidents.

### Arrest of Strange Young Man Leads to Unexpected Bust of Gambling Den

[Our Wujin, 26th Report] A strange young man named Yu Chongguang, about twenty years old, has been staying at Room 140 of the Central Hotel in the city since arriving from elsewhere last month. He carries a pistol with him, leaves early and returns late every day, and his movements are mysterious, attracting the attention of the city defense department. On the 26th, early in the morning, officers were dispatched to the back of the Yingbin Hotel. After breaking down the door, they discovered a large group of gamblers gathered in a room gambling. Yu Chongguang was also among the crowd. One thousand gamblers were taken to the department along with gambling paraphernalia, gambling money, silver dollars, and banknotes for interrogation. After strict questioning, the young man Yu confessed that he was originally from Jiangxi, moved to Taiwan, and his family was quite wealthy. He came to Changzhou this time to take the entrance examination for the Provincial Changzhong School. Because the examination period had passed and he was not admitted, he stayed at the hotel. At the same time, a six-tael gold bar cast in Hong Kong was found in Yu's suitcase, and a pistol with eight bullets was seized from a friend. The case is still under investigation.

Social Services Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation

### Young Man Regrets Engagement and Requests Explanation; Answered by Lawyer Tang Mingshi

Editor: Last spring, a reader was engaged to a certain lady by his elder brother's decision (no marriage contract, no banquet, only a few items were given). At the time, I expressed disagreement and even opposed it. However, in order to avoid breaking fraternal affection, I reluctantly went through the engagement procedure with a certain lady (hereinafter referred to as the other party) under semi-coercion. After several months of investigation, I realized that the other party was not only illiterate but also an unteachable woman, making it impossible to unite. The other party's parents have repeatedly urged the wedding to be held, but I have been evasive and delaying, saying that my current economic capacity is insufficient and preparations are not yet complete. Considering my future happiness, I must not make a mistake again and again. Now is the time to terminate the contract, but as someone unfamiliar with the law, I feel at a loss in everything. Therefore, I have told you the whole story and ask you to enlighten me.

[Answer] Marriage should not rely too much on ideals, and family is very practical. Shanghai is prosperous, and young people's dreams often focus on freedom and appearance, leading to infatuation with lovers, resulting in marital suffering. It must be known that husband and wife are based on common feelings and common sense, not the celestial beings in novels. Moreover, in this day and age, where economics determines everything, one should especially consider the situation when forming a family in the future. Therefore, please carefully consider whether you are a good match, and do not rashly consider the other party unsuitable and want to terminate the engagement simply because of your elder brother's orders, the other party's level of knowledge, or the other party's appearance and clothing! As for the points you asked, I will answer them separately as follows: (1) The law stipulates that a male or female engagement must have the consent of the parties involved. If there is no consent, it is naturally invalid. However, at the time of the engagement, did you know that you were already of age? If you were already of age but did not voice your disagreement at that time, and now that the engagement has been made, you are requesting termination of the contract, you should be responsible for compensating the other party for any damage to their reputation and actual losses. Therefore, the termination of the contract should be with the consent of the other party; it cannot be effective based on a unilateral claim, such as a notice or announcement. (2) Lawyers only handle legal procedures on behalf of their clients and should not be mistaken to think that hiring a lawyer can turn an invalid agreement into a valid one. (3) The return of engagement gifts depends entirely on who is at fault for the termination of the contract. (4) If the other party understands reason and logic, they should seek a solution and not delay it unreasonably, which would harm their own life. However, in order to obtain favorable terms, it is not impossible to ignore unreasonable requests and urge the fulfillment of the engagement. (5) Without terminating the current engagement, you cannot make another engagement with a third party, which would cause disputes. (6) A lawyer's obligation is limited to wrongful imprisonment; if you want to protect your rights or remove obstacles, you should pay appropriate fees. This newspaper's social service column is limited to answering legal questions, and we do not introduce lawyers for hire.

### Mail-Order Fountain Pen Is Not Delivered After a Long Delay...Reader Asks for Attention to Reputation...

(1) We hope the Ximeilishi Company will pay attention.

Dear Editor: I previously wrote to your column to inquire about the delayed approval of the fountain pen by the Meilishi Company.
