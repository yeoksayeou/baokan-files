### Bohai Bay, Huludao Port: Rebel Ship Chongqing Bombed and Destroyed; Some Officers and Soldiers Have Complied with Persuasion and Landed

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 19th] The 7,000-ton naval rebel ship Chongqing, after desperately returning south, was bombed today by Air Force B-24 aircraft. According to preliminary reports, the ship has been hit by two large bombs in Huludao Port in Bohai Bay, sustaining initial damage. As of the time of this dispatch, Air Force heavy aircraft are continuing to bomb the vessel under the personal aerial command of Commander Chen Jiashang of the Second Military Region.

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 19th] Twenty days after the defection of the Chinese Navy ship Chongqing on February 26th, it was bombed by Chinese Air Force aircraft at the CCP-controlled seaport of Huludao, inflicting heavy damage. During the twenty days since its defection, its life at sea was quite miserable. In the first two days, the Shanghai Port Radio Station of the Naval Headquarters still believed it was fighting winds and waves on its way to Taiwan. From the third day, it began broadcasting from Dong Yantai Port, expressing its embrace of the CCP. When the Naval Headquarters discovered its disappearance, the authorities knew the inside story was serious, but dared not completely determine that it had defected to the Communists at all costs. It was not until the long-range reconnaissance aircraft of the Air Force first discovered the massive hull of the Chongqing in Yantai Port on March 3rd that the ship's whereabouts were fully confirmed. The military immediately began studying how to deal with the situation and immediately contacted the Chongqing's radio station by radio waves. The Chongqing also knew that if it did not feign compliance when aircraft shadows swept across the sky, it would inevitably face immediate disaster. Therefore, it also sent out false reports from time to time, claiming that there were disagreements on board and that if they waited a while, they might return south. This dragged on until March 10th. At that time, while the Naval Headquarters was communicating with the ship, it dispatched the Haiheng gunboat from March 3rd to deploy in the Changshan Island area at the southern end of the Miaodao Strait to monitor the Bohai Sea entrance. Another transport ship carrying a guard battalion of soldiers went to Liujiagou in Penglai County on March 14th to land, in order to enter Yantai from the ground. They also reported that the Chongqing was still docked in Yantai on the 9th, but disappeared on the 10th. The battalion commander then learned from the people in the CCP-controlled area in Penglai that more than 20 sailors from Longkou, Huang County, had landed in Yantai, then retired and returned to their hometowns. The CCP had mobilized the villagers to celebrate their return. At the same time, it was learned that because the CCP did not fully trust the ship, it had ordered some of the officers and soldiers to disembark and replaced them with some elite Communist officers and soldiers to assist. The CCP also knew that it was very dangerous for the ship to dock in Yantai. If it wanted to immediately use the ship to go south and fight with the remaining naval vessels, it was impossible emotionally. Furthermore, Communist military strategists and officers on board had also warned of the terrifying power of the Air Force. If it returned to the Soviet-controlled port of Lushun, it could escape the danger of being bombed, but the Soviet Union would be drawn into an international negotiation. In the end, it had no choice but to sail north, turn west at the northern end of the Miaodao Islands into the Bohai Sea, and then sail north to Huludao Port in Liaodong Bay. When the Chongqing finally reached this port of refuge after such a miserable northward voyage, the officers and soldiers on board had been completely worn down of their rebellious spirit when they left Shanghai due to the lack of heavy oil, fresh water, and a lack of unified will. After making various replenishments in Huludao and slightly recovering their spirits and physical strength, they really did not know where their next destination would be, and at this time, the long arm of the Air Force finally reached them again. On March 14th, when the Air Force learned again that the Chongqing had disappeared from Yantai, it immediately dispatched reconnaissance aircraft to search the ocean in different directions. One of them carried Staff Officer Xu from the Naval Headquarters and flew along the coast of Jiaodong Peninsula to Yantai, where it found three merchant ships, and then flew to Changshan Island. Another even traced the coastline of the Liaodong Peninsula all the way to the Yalu River. Another route was in Bohai Bay. After two days of reconnaissance, on the 15th, a C-47 aircraft finally found it in Huludao Port. After the Naval Headquarters considered it as quickly as possible, it immediately entrusted the Air Force to deal with it. From the 15th, this sea patrol ship was first monitored by aircraft dispatched by the Air Force, and bombing of the ship began on the 18th. Since the total number of officers and soldiers on board was about 700, the Air Force first advised them to disembark. Some of them complied with the advice and disembarked, while others, with the assistance of the Communist army, used the ship's 24 anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns to fight against the air. In the bombing on the 18th, only one 1,000-pound bomb hit the ship's rear mast, causing the ship to emit thick smoke and a huge fire. On the 19th, the Air Force bombed it for the second time, and three large bombs hit the ship's deck, finally destroying the ship's oil storage tanks. According to the report of the last returning P-38 aircraft, the ship was already in a state of full-ship fire. In order to carry out the task of bombing the ship, Director Mao Yingchu of the Air Force personally flew to Qingdao to deploy and command. Commander Chen Jiashang of the Second Military Region personally drove a C-59 aircraft to command over Huludao, while the B-24 aircraft were led by Deputy Brigade Commander Hou Jie.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The rebel ship Huang An, which was heavily damaged by the Air Force in Lianyungang on the 15th, was continued to be bombed by Air Force aircraft today. The ship was completely destroyed, with three-quarters of the hull sunk in the sea, leaving only a small part of the bow above the water.

### Acting President Assists in Forming a Cabinet; Visited Various Parties in Shanghai Yesterday to Persuade Them; Also Discussed Economic Reform Issues

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The Acting President went to Shanghai on the 18th to assist in the work of forming a cabinet, in order to recruit new cabinet candidates and discuss economic reform issues. He has now completed his mission and returned to Nanjing from Shanghai by the special plane Tianxiong around 5:00 pm on the 19th. According to the responsibility of forming a cabinet, it should belong to Mr. He, but Mr. He has encountered difficulties in the past few days, and there are signs of stillbirth. Mr. He also frankly explained his difficulties to the Acting President. After consideration, the Acting President decided to call Mr. He at 4:30 pm on the 18th and decided to go to Shanghai in person to assist Mr. He. However, the Acting President refused to explain the mission to Shanghai to reporters. When the special plane Daxiong arrived in Beijing at 5:23 pm on the 19th, it was in the midst of a fierce storm. After he got off the plane, reporters asked him about inviting new cabinet candidates. He replied, "Forming a cabinet is the responsibility of the President of the Executive Yuan." When reporters asked about the mission to Shanghai, the Acting President only said, "Just for fun." He then took a car back to the Chuánhòugǎng residence.

[Our Dispatch] Amidst the stillbirth of the new cabinet, Acting President Li suddenly arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the night before last, in a quiet manner, to contact various parties in a personal capacity to assist He Yingqin in forming a cabinet. The Acting President took the special plane Tianxiong back to the capital from Shanghai at 4:10 pm yesterday. During his stay in Shanghai, he was in a state of tense mobility and successively exchanged views with Xue Dubi, Mei YiQi, Hu Shi, Liu Gongyun, Xi Xuesui, Zhang Jiaxuan, Chen Guangfu, Zhang Junmai, etc. As of the time of his departure from Shanghai, the reactions of all parties were as follows: Although Mr. Xue Dubi was repeatedly urged by Mr. Li, he is still humbly declining the position of Deputy President. Mei YiQi also firmly refused to take the position of Minister of Education. Weng Wenhao and Hu Shi tried to persuade him to no avail, and Mr. Mei planned to go to Guangzhou in the coming days. Zhang Junmai also visited Acting President Li yesterday to discuss the issue of the Democratic Socialist Party joining the cabinet. However, according to reliable sources, Mr. Zhang personally resolutely opposed joining the cabinet. Not only did he not intend to be responsible for actual ministries, but he also believed that there was no need to serve as a political affairs committee member. The opinions within the party on joining the cabinet were extremely inconsistent. There were also strong advocates for participation, but without Mr. Zhang's consent, individual actions would not occur. The leaders of the Youth Party did not have contact with Acting President Li in Shanghai, but as of now, the Youth Party, at least on the surface, still adheres to the attitude of its declaration on the 18th regarding the issue of joining the cabinet. In addition to assisting He Yingqin in forming a cabinet, another mission of Mr. Li's visit to Shanghai was to discuss the reform of financial and economic issues with leaders of the financial community here. The Acting President personally visited Zhang Jiaxuan and Chen Guangfu at their residences yesterday morning for a secret talk lasting about three hours. According to relevant sources, both Zhang and Chen have no intention of participating in actual politics, so the talks were entirely about studying the nature of the problems. The highest-ranking officials in charge of finance and banking in the new cabinet will continue in their positions to maintain the consistency of policies.

Acting President Li was very busy after arriving in Shanghai. He had contact with Xue Dubi, Mei YiQi, and Hu Shi the night before last, urging Mr. Xue and Mr. Mei to join the new cabinet. Around 9:00 am yesterday morning, Mr. Li first went to Bóshí Road to visit Zhang Jiaxuan, and then went to Fukaissen Road to meet with Chen Guangfu, talking for up to three hours. According to Mr. Zhang Jiaxuan, Acting President Li urgently wanted to understand the local economic situation. The biggest economic problem at present is still the excessive financial expenditure. If you want to talk about improvement, it should still be after the establishment of the new cabinet. From 1:00 pm, Acting President Li met with Liu Gongyun, Ji Xuesui, and Zhang Junmai separately for discussions. At 4:10 pm, Acting President Li took the special plane Tianxiong back to Beijing with Weng Wenhao, Liu Gongyun, Cheng Siyuan and others.

[Our Dispatch] Hang Liwu visited Acting President Li yesterday afternoon at 1:00 pm for discussions. Relevant sources revealed that the most difficult cabinet members in the new cabinet are those in the three departments of Internal Affairs, Foreign Affairs, and Education, and no decisions have been made yet. Among them, the Department of Education is particularly difficult due to the shortage of funds and the complexity of the problems. There is also a lack of ideal candidates to fill the position, so people such as Mei YiQi and Wu Yifang have firmly declined to take the position. Hang Liwu is also a possible candidate.

[United Press, Guangzhou Dispatch, 19th] Well-informed sources said today that the new President of the Executive Yuan, He Yingqin, has telegraphed Wu Tiecheng to continue serving as the Deputy President.

### Personnel Selection for Minister of Internal Affairs Faces Hesitation; New Personnel and New Attacks in the New Cabinet May Be Difficult to Realize

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] With the assistance of Acting President Li, the selection of personnel for He's cabinet made progress on the evening of the 19th, but the complete list, which was originally scheduled to be finalized on the evening of the 19th, has not yet been announced. He first invited Weng Wenhao, Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, Wu Zhongxin, and Huang Shaogu, who had returned from Shanghai, to a meeting at 6:00 pm on the evening of the 19th. Weng reported on the negotiations in Shanghai and continued to study the personnel arrangements in detail. At 8:30 pm, the Acting President personally went to Doujizha to participate in the meeting, and left around 9:00 pm. It is learned that the most difficult personnel choice in the new cabinet is actually the Minister of Internal Affairs. Initially, Xue Dubi, who is honest and currently practicing law in Shanghai, was intended, but Xue did not agree. There was also talk of inviting Li Hanhun, but then it was changed again to have Huang Shaogu, who had already been decided as Secretary-General, become the Minister of Internal Affairs. However, it was changed again on the 19th, with Huang still serving as Secretary-General. The position of Minister of Internal Affairs was then to persuade Xue Dubi to serve concurrently as Deputy President, but Xue's consent has not yet been obtained. Secondly, it has been generally decided that the Minister of Economic Affairs will be Sun Yueqi, the Minister of Foreign Affairs is expected to be Chuan Bingchang, and the Minister of Transportation will continue to invite Xu Zuofu to take office. He will concurrently serve as the Minister of National Defense, and Hang Liwu is generally likely to be the Minister of Education. According to the latest news, if Xue firmly refuses, Jia Jingde will be invited to serve as Deputy President, and Li Hanhun may be the Minister of Internal Affairs. It is also learned that Xu Kan sent a letter to He on the 19th to resign from the position of Minister of Finance, so there is one more vacancy in the cabinet list. Also, if this list can be decided within days, in terms of party affairs, all Kuomintang members will be submitted to the Central Standing Committee for approval by the Political Council. In terms of administrative procedures, the President will nominate them, so the announcement period still needs to wait one or two days. Up to now, most people are waiting for the good news of the new cabinet with great patience, but the constant news of rejections makes everyone fear that the new cabinet will be difficult for new people. The new policy of performance.

### Guo Dejie Arrives in Beijing from Guilin; Shares Shaddock with Reporters

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The Acting President's wife, Guo Dejie, flew to Beijing from Guilin by special plane at 3:00 pm on the 19th. Guo got off the plane in the pouring rain, and there were many people who came to meet her, but Guo could not find her husband in the crowd. After reporters told her that he had not returned yet, she suddenly realized and asked where he had gone. The reporters told her that he would be back from Shanghai in an hour. The lady smiled and got in the car. Also, the lady's special plane carried many baskets of Guangxi shaddock, and the reporters shared two of them on the spot.

### Acting President Li; Telegraphs Northwest Officials; To Come to Beijing to Discuss National Affairs; Yu Hanmou and Xue Yue Fly to Beijing from Guangzhou

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Acting President Li recently telegraphed Northwest military and political officials separately to come to Beijing to discuss national affairs. The officials summoned include Bawurhan, Ma Bufang, Ma Hongda, Guo Jijiao, and Dong Zhao. They are expected to arrive in Beijing in the short term.

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 19th] It is reported that Yu Hanmou and Xue Yue are scheduled to fly to Beijing on the 20th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Acting President Li hosted a banquet at the Presidential Palace at 7:00 pm on the evening of the 19th for military and political officials who arrived in Beijing, including Chen Cheng, Zhu Shaoliang, Wang Lingji, and Yang Sen, and Gu Zhutong, Zhou Zhirou, Gui Yongqing, Li Hanhun, Liu Jianqun, and Huang Shaogu accompanied them.

### Regarding the Matter of Raising the Price of Silver Dollars; The Control Yuan Dispatches Three Committees to Investigate Thoroughly

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] At the general meeting of the Control Yuan on the morning of the 19th, several members of the Control Yuan expressed their indignation upon seeing reports in the newspapers that the Central Bank had raised the price of silver dollars to 7,000 yuan per piece for sale, leading to the rise of gold banknotes and prices. They strongly advocated a thorough investigation. Seven members of the Control Yuan, including Hu Wenhui, Li Mengbiao, Liu Xingzhi, Ma Kongqun, Lu Fengge, Chen Darong, and Gesang Yuexi, proposed a temporary emergency motion stating: "It is hereby reported that today's newspapers reported that the National Bank decided on the 18th to raise the price of gold and silver, resulting in a sharp rise in prices. What is the intention? Personnel should be dispatched to the Ministry of Finance as soon as possible for inquiries and emergency corrections should be made. Is this feasible? Please make a public decision." After President Yu submitted it for discussion, Hu Wenhui briefly explained the proposal. There was no objection from the entire venue and it passed. Hu Wenhui, Tang Honglie, and He Jizhou were appointed as visiting committee members to conduct a thorough investigation. The three have scheduled to visit Finance Minister Xu Kan and National Bank President Liu Gongyun on the 20th to inquire about the truth.

### In Order to Defend Southern Henan and Eastern Hubei: Important Bridgeheads; The National Army Decides to Ensure Them with All Its Strength; Commander Zhang Zhen Leaves Wuhan and Returns to Xinyang

[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 19th] According to military sources, the two corps of the Communist army, originally belonging to Liu Bocheng's forces, which pushed westward from northern Anhui via Zhengyangguan and Sanhejian, have mostly arrived in Shangcheng and Gushi in southern Henan, and joined Chen Geng's corps, which is heading south along the Xinhuang Highway, on the south bank of the Huai River. It is reported that as of the 18th, the total strength of the Communist army gathered in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui is more than 150,000, and the Communist army that has invaded the Macheng area of eastern Hubei is less than 20,000. The main force of the Communist army on the north bank of the Huai River has almost completely gone south, leaving only a few land-based Communists to contain them. According to an authoritative military source, the Communist army's current concentration of a large army in the above-mentioned areas has a very clear intention. If it is said that the Communist army in this corner can rely on its superior strength to go straight to the east bank of the Ye River and choose its attack focus between Xinshun, Xishui, Wuxue, and Tianjiazhen in order to cross the river, it seems too early. However, the threat to the Pinghan Railway and the flanks of Hankou should not be ignored. From his observation, the military will be able to ensure the important bridgeheads in southern Henan and eastern Hubei with all its strength, and the recovery of Macheng and Lishan is also a matter of time.

[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 19th] Zhang Zhen, Chairman of Henan and Commander of the Fifth Pacification Zone, returned here from Wuhan at noon on the 19th. He immediately convened a meeting of generals at the Pacification Zone headquarters and gave important instructions.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 19th] Zhang Zhen returned to Xinyang at 7:00 am on the 19th. During his visit to Wuhan, Zhang had several audiences with Commander-in-Chief Bai, to whom he made reports. It is said that Bai gave a comprehensive indication of the situation in southern Henan and future developments.

### The Authorities Strictly Prevent the Communist Army from Crossing the Yangtze River to the South; Jiangfang Headquarters Will Be Established; Amidst the Talk of Peace, the Situation is Full of the Possibility of Resuming War

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] In order to strictly prevent the Communist army from crossing the Yangtze River to the south, the authorities have recently planned to establish Jiangfang Headquarters to command the Navy, Army, and Air Force in the south of the Yangtze River in a unified manner to strengthen the original command structure. It is said that this organization can be implemented after being approved by the highest military authorities. In addition, the Ministry of National Defense held a high-level military conference at 9:00 am on the 19th. Gui Yongqing, Zhou Zhirou, Guo Qian, Lin Wei, Hou Teng and more than ten people attended, chaired by Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong. In addition to reporting on defense and listening to enemy intelligence reports, the discussion on how to prevent the Communist army from crossing the Yangtze River was particularly detailed.

[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The political atmosphere in the Chinese government-controlled areas now seems more like war than peace. The undercurrent of concern for the future is beginning to gather beneath the surface of enthusiasm for a political solution with the Communists, although officials expect peace talks to begin soon and officials openly say they are optimistic about the future of peace. Qualified observers believe the current situation is fraught with the possibility of explosion. Peace talks are expected to begin but could break down at any time, and war could resume. In addition, if Acting President Li and President He cannot overcome opposition forces, internal political disputes within the government will deepen and the increasingly dire financial situation could worsen.

Current signs indicate that the tension that is beginning is sweeping across the calm surface. Recent returnees from previous withdrawals are said to be packing their bags again. Qualified observers believe the resurgence of tension is mainly due to the southward movement of Lin Biao's troops. In the eyes of the Chinese people, Lin Biao's troops are of greater importance than other Communist troops.

These recent developments in the war, as well as news regarding the CCP's administration of Beiping, are said to have made even those who were absolutely optimistic about peace doubt the possibility of a peaceful solution. According to a legislator who did not want his name to be published, the southward movement of Lin Biao's troops and the CCP's administration in Beiping have weakened the voice of those who advocate peace within the government and strengthened the calls of those who advocate war. Another legislator, who also did not want his name to be published, predicted the following timeline for the peace talks: The peace talks will begin in two weeks, last for two weeks, and then break down. He believes that the CCP, which has repeatedly won battles, is probably unwilling to bargain, but only to ask a yes or no answer.

### In the Narrow Area Near the Yangtze River Bank in Northern Jiangsu; The Communist Army is Intensifying Its Mobilization; The National Army Has Dispatched Warships to Patrol the Jiangyin Area

[Our Wujin Dispatch, 19th] In coordination with its overall strategy and political strategy, the Communist army in northern Jiangsu is intensifying its mobilization work in a narrow area within 50 to 100 li from the riverbank. At present, except for the two columns of Guangdong and Guangxi and the 13th Column, which were previously reported to be on the Grand Canal, and the 9th Column in the northeast of Taixing, which have not been definitively confirmed to exist, there are six columns between Yangzhou and Nantong, deployed on the four lines of Yangtai, Haitai, Koutai, and Tongyu, respectively. The 4th Column is on the Koutai line. The 11th Division of this unit, attached to the two independent regiments of Liangtai, advanced south to the front of the National Army's position in Kouan on the afternoon of the 19th. Its vanguard force, about 1,000 people, has reached the front line closest to the riverbank. Near Sanjiangying, west of Kouan, a part of the Communist army, about 3,000 people, has also infiltrated. The 1st Column, which was recently transferred, arrived between Taixian and Xiannyumiao on the Yangtai line on the 15th. The 10th Column, which was transferred east from Yangzhou, is on the Taixing-Jianjiang line, turning southeast from the Koutai line. Jiangyanzhen, east of Taixian, is the original Changjiang Column 101, 102, and 103 regiments stationed between Huangqiao and Jianjiang. East of Jiangyan near Haian is the 10th Column. The 11th Column is still stationed in Rugao and its southern areas. South of Rugao in Nantong is still the Changjiang Column 104, 105, and 106 regiments.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 19th] The Provincial Security Department released the Communist army's movements for the week on the 19th: (1) The 11th Column and the 12th Column have forced their way to the area near the Liuxizhen Public Office Bridge on the riverbank north of Jianjiang, with no other significant changes. (2) The 3rd Column (transferred from the west bank of the Hongze District) has newly arrived in Huaiyin. (3) The Communist army is now actively training boat handling techniques in various places and moving baggage and supplies to the riverside areas as much as possible.

[Our Jiangyin Dispatch, 19th] The Communist army in Jingnan Shixu has increased its troops, with the aim of seizing the Buxigang bridgehead. The military has dispatched additional warships to Cheng to patrol.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 19th] There was a minor skirmish on the Shijiaoqiao front on the morning of the 19th. The invading Communist army retreated after half an hour of fighting.

### Sunday Forum: A Review and Prospectus of the Postal Service

— Wang Yuguang

— A Speech Commemorating the 53rd Anniversary of the Republic of China Postal Service —

Confucius said, "The spread of virtue is faster than delivering messages by post." According to the Zengyun dictionary, "Ma Zhuan is called Zhi, Bu Zhuan is called You," these were two ancient methods of delivering official documents, equivalent to the current postal service. The analogy must be popular, which shows that in the minds of ordinary people at that time, the postal service must have been extremely fast. Otherwise, Confucius would not have cited this as an example. In modern times, post offices replaced the old courier stations, transforming from imperial official stations to civilian post offices. The scope of jurisdiction became wider, and the matters handled became more complex. In terms of speed, it has indeed surpassed the past, but in terms of difficulties, it has also far exceeded the past. The target of the postal service has changed, and its mission must also change and become heavier, which is very obvious. In order to adapt to this mission, the service goals have also been broadened. What is this broadening? It is: China has a vast territory and a large population. Since the postal service takes the public as its service target, it must strive to reach even remote areas. Therefore, in addition to "speed," it must also pursue "universality," this is one. The era of exclusive use of postal services for official documents has passed. The demand for postal services is increasing, but financial resources are limited. Sometimes, the transportation and receipt of mail are handled by others, so in the midst of "universality," we must strive for "security," this is one. The habit of "bureaucratic arrogance" has long been criticized, and the "cold faces behind copper railings" have also become a topic of conversation. In this century of the people, old ideas must be eliminated. Since the postal service takes the common people as the target of its development, it must take the lead in advocating respect for public opinion and thinking of the public in everything. If the strength is insufficient, make up for it with sincerity. Use a kind, thorough, and tireless "service spirit" to cultivate a good social atmosphere, this is three. The goals that the postal service promotes today are speed, universality, security, and service. The painful and difficult experience of the past fifty-three years has resulted in this understanding.

The postal reform measures of the past two or three years have been obvious. I will not repeat them here. Since last year, everything that has been done, such as strengthening airmail delivery, improving rural postal services, promoting insured registered mail, establishing public communication service stations for relocation, and restoring mail services between the Kuomintang and Communist areas, has been done in accordance with this goal. Although the environment has changed and obstacles have increased, as long as there is a bit of strength, do a bit of work; as long as there is a spark, emit a bit of light. "Plant melons and get melons," the effect is still there. Looking at this effect and analyzing it, we feel that there are four factors that can be listed:

First, the encouragement of public opinion and the love of the public. In the past year, public opinion has encouraged and urged the postal service, either in editorials or in special articles, expressing praise and criticism. Reports have been endless, publishing postal service Q&As, publishing postal service news, and providing assistance in various ways to nurture this tender sprout. As for the public's suggestions to the postal service, they are particularly enthusiastic in the reply forms of the postal service's inquiries. Accepting public opinion and not blocking the channels of communication are the keys to success or failure in all things. Today, many of the postal service's new measures come from public suggestions. Street talk is worth collecting, let alone official suggestions. Meng Jin vigorously implemented this, this is a clear lesson.

Second, the assistance of transportation departments. Transportation is the lifeline of the postal service. Due to inherent shortcomings, the post office is unable to widely equip itself with transportation tools. Air transportation such as airplanes, land transportation such as trains and highway vehicles, and water transportation such as ships and civilian boats all rely on existing institutions. In the past few years, transportation agencies have paid special attention to the rapid delivery of mail, and have made indelible contributions to the postal service's voluntary completion of its tasks of speed, universality, safety, and service. Chinese society has always lacked a spirit of cooperation, so the cooperation and assistance given to the postal service by transportation agencies are particularly impressive.

Third, the excellence of the postal system. The excellence of the postal system is also one of the basic conditions for the postal service to achieve some success today. As is well known, the postal service is a neutral institution with international characteristics, and the reason for maintaining this tradition is due to the strictness and completeness of its system. The postal service has a perfect personnel system, a strict inspection system, and a meticulous accounting system. Recruitment must be through examination, promotion must comply with regulations, diligence and laziness are rewarded and punished, and the old and sick are given pensions. People are used to their full potential, and things are used to their full potential. In the handling of postal affairs, there is only system, no human relations; only career, no individual. Postal workers can serve with peace of mind because of this guarantee. Looking at today and reminiscing about the past, the painstaking efforts of the postal service's predecessors to revise and diligently maintain the system cannot be ignored.

Fourth, the efforts of postal workers. Finally, we must also mention the efforts of postal workers. The backbone of a career lies in the system, and the flesh and blood of a career are filled with human power. Postal workers must pass examinations for recruitment, and their knowledge and skills are above the standard. In the past two or three years, in coordination with the implementation of new facilities, they have worked together to ensure success. In general, they can understand the mission of the times and the responsibilities they should bear for their lifelong careers. "Not to be served, but to serve," this is the motto of today's postal workers.

In a period of social transformation, the postal service, this neutral institution with international characteristics, is also facing the greatest difficulties in fifty-three years. We believe that with the love of the public for the postal service, the assistance of transportation agencies to the postal service, and the postal service's own perseverance and spirit of serving the public, it will overcome all difficulties and return to a smooth path.

### Proposal to Stop Conscription and Grain徵收 Under Review by the Legislative Yuan

A Committee Will Be Formed to Study a Thorough Reform of the Military Service System

[Reported by this newspaper from Nanjing on the 19th] The Legislative Yuan began reviewing the proposal to quickly stop conscription and grain徵收 on the morning of the 19th. Due to time constraints, only the conscription portion was discussed. Some members opposed stopping conscription and grain徵收, and most advocated reforming the malpractices of conscription. The conclusion was to appoint seven members to be responsible for studying and drafting a thorough reform plan for the military service system based on the written and oral opinions of the members. Only a brief opinion was expressed on the grain徵收 portion, and the review was rescheduled for 9:00 a.m. on the 21st. When the meeting was held on the 19th, Yang Yifeng presided over the meeting. Representatives from the Military Service Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Food, and the Joint Logistics Headquarters attended the meeting to report and provide oral answers to some of the questions raised. Some questions were answered in writing. The specific opinions expressed by the members included reducing the conscription quota, adopting Yan Xishan's method of combining soldiers and civilians to select security forces, reorganizing local fugitive teams, incorporating captured and returned officers and soldiers, and recruiting vagrant soldiers and scattered braves to fill the source of soldiers.

Content of the Outline for Political Reform

[Reported by this newspaper from Nanjing on the 19th] The outline for political reform drafted by the Legislative Yuan was severely criticized by the members at a symposium of the Legislative Yuan on the afternoon of the 19th. Some members believed that the content of the outline was too complicated, had many loopholes, and repeated the provisions in the Constitution, which was tantamount to nonsense. It would be better to put in more effort to formulate a plan for the government to implement earnestly. The original drafters argued that the outline was drafted based on the opinions expressed by the members. If there was anything inappropriate, it could still be revised. It was decided to hold a subcommittee review meeting again on the 21st. The Legislative Yuan symposium on the 19th initially discussed the content of the joint meeting of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members on the 20th. Because some Legislative Yuan members advocated discussing political reform at the meeting, it involved the first draft of the outline for political reform. Although there were many speakers on the content of the meeting, no conclusion was reached. It was only decided to recommend Yu Youren as the chairman of the meeting. The first draft of the outline for political reform of the Legislative Yuan is as follows: (1) The Executive Yuan should be a responsible cabinet that lives up to its name and is effectively responsible to the Legislative Yuan. All policies and important measures must be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for resolution before implementation. (2) The central and local administrative agencies and state-owned enterprises should be consolidated and merged in accordance with the principle of strict austerity. The powers and responsibilities of each agency must be clearly defined, and the procedures and formalities for handling affairs should be simplified as much as possible. (3) Forcefully correct the malpractices of central centralization, and earnestly implement the system of balanced power. Local governments should not be interfered with by the central government in measures within their jurisdiction. The central government's business in the localities should be entrusted to the local governments as much as possible. The central and local fiscal revenue and expenditure systems should be strictly and rationally divided. The autonomy of provinces (cities), counties (cities), and Mongolian and Tibetan areas should be implemented quickly. (4) The size of the Ministry of National Defense should be reduced, the Joint Logistics Headquarters should be abolished, the number of national troops should be reduced, military officers and service personnel should be reduced to the minimum, military salaries should be strictly issued, military discipline should be strictly rectified, the personnel system should be reformed, and military orders should be unified. (5) Implement the recruitment of volunteers to supplement the inadequacy of the conscription system. The provisions in the Military Service Law regarding the methods of deferral and exemption should be revised immediately if they are unfair. The abuses arising from micro-soldiers should be strictly corrected. (6) All borrowing and requisitioning should be stopped, and the grain徵收 should be changed to gold yuan coupons or silver coins based on the value of the land, depending on the situation in each region. (7) Strictly enforce the collection of property taxes, investigate and freeze the capital of wealthy families and bureaucrats, and confiscate them in part or in full according to the severity of their illegal income. (8) The Central Bank should be directly under the Ministry of Finance. The China, Communications, and China Agricultural Banks, the China Trust and Savings Bureau, and the Central Cooperative Treasury should be consolidated and merged according to their business nature. The presiding personnel should be thoroughly replaced, the inventory should be thoroughly investigated, and the issuance and business should be strictly managed and supervised. Commercial banks should be strictly cracked down on. (9) The treatment of soldiers and civil and military public school personnel should be reasonably adjusted to ensure their family life. The treatment of employees of state-owned enterprises should not be particularly superior. (10) Implement the separation of civil and military affairs. Active-duty soldiers should not concurrently hold civil positions. The personnel system should be earnestly promoted in accordance with the law. Each agency should not privately recommend personnel. (11) Make proper arrangements for the relief of the unemployed and out-of-school students and the safety of refugee students. (12) Actively promote land reform to quickly achieve the goal of land to the tiller, and promote increased production of grain and cotton in different regions according to the suitability of soil and climate. (13) Dredge transportation to promote the exchange of goods between various parts of the country, and encourage and rationally guide import and export trade.

[Reported by this newspaper from Guangzhou on the 19th] Zhang Qun flew to Chongqing by Central Airlines plane at 9:40 a.m. on the 19th. His mother, son, and daughter-in-law Du Fen traveled with him.

In response to reporters' questions about the new cabinet, Zhang said that it was difficult to compile a list of cabinet members because Mr. He was a military man. Regarding the issue of peace and war, Zhang said: According to the current national army, regardless of quantity and quality, it is not impossible to fight the communist army. What is lacking is the organizational power between single teams. His words may refer to unity.

### Overseas Chinese Face Restrictions on Entering the United States; Overseas Chinese Leaders Are Launching Protests, Urging Amendments to Two Clauses in the Bill

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 18th] Local overseas Chinese leaders are launching overseas Chinese organizations in various cities along the Pacific to protest against two clauses in the Chinese Immigration Bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on the 1st of this month. In addition, the Chinese American Association (an organization of American citizens of Chinese descent) has sent letters to President Truman and leaders of both houses of Congress, urging them to pay attention to the harm that the bill will cause to their family interests. Furthermore, two local overseas Chinese leaders flew to Washington last week to personally appeal to the authorities. Overseas Chinese organizations have also launched a fundraising campaign to raise funds to cover the expenses. According to the original proposal submitted by Congressman Judd, the aim is to completely eliminate the traditional discrimination against Asian immigrants such as Japanese and Indonesian people entering the country. It is still remembered that the U.S. law restricting Chinese immigrants was abolished six years ago. Since then, the entry of overseas Chinese has been changed to a quota system. In 1946, a law was passed recognizing that the wives of American citizens of Chinese descent would not be subject to the above quota restrictions. Now that Judd's proposal is to eliminate racial discrimination against Asian immigrants, the restriction on the entry of overseas Chinese wives should be abolished. Therefore, the local overseas Chinese community only wants to amend the two clauses of the bill, and the provision in the 1946 law allowing the wives of American citizens of Chinese descent to enter the country without being subject to quota restrictions should continue to be implemented.

### The Xiangxi Rebellion Has No Political Background; Supervisor Tang Honglie Talks About His Return to Beijing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Supervisor Tang Honglie returned to Beijing from Changsha on the 18th and attended the meeting of the Supervisory Yuan. According to him, the Xiangxi incident was as follows: The Xiangxi rebellion was purely the result of two or three retired and unemployed military officers, based on the psychology of seeking personal advancement and dissatisfaction with the measures of local officials, taking the opportunity to unite civilian guns. There is definitely no political background or other political motives. Since Chairman Cheng returned to his post from Beijing, after investigating the full facts of the matter, the relevant主管 civil and military officials in the local area have been rewarded and punished according to their merits and demerits. As for all the rebel insurgents, the policy of suppression and appeasement was adopted and implemented immediately. Now, in addition to some of them having complied, the rest, such as Zhang Yulin, have directly telegraphed Chairman Cheng to express their remorse, await disposal, while others have retreated into the valleys, still harboring intentions. It is expected that this incident will be completely resolved in a few days.

### Hankou Gradually Becoming a Dead City; Wounds from Wartime Not Yet Healed, Market Depressed; Riverside Mansion Gradually Collapsing, Overwhelmed by Nostalgia

[Agence France-Presse, Hankou, 19th] Hankou, formerly the industrial and commercial center of Central China, is gradually becoming a dead city. Devastated by the Japanese occupation during the Anti-Japanese War, bombed by American aircraft, and then hit by currency inflation, further impacted by the cessation of foreign shipping and the ongoing civil war, this city of 1.3 million residents has now become merely an administrative area, and the market is becoming increasingly depressed. The Hanyang Iron Works no longer exists. The factory was looted by the Japanese army, and even the factory buildings were dismantled, using the bricks and stones, and is now a pile of rubble. Only the remains of the steel furnaces remain. Today, the so-called industry consists only of four yarn factories. In 1944, American Superfortress bombers destroyed all the port's equipment, factories, and warehouses, leveling almost the entire former German and Japanese concessions. The former British concession was also heavily damaged. After this destruction, and due to the prohibition of foreign ships from sailing here, Hankou's shipping industry has decreased by three-quarters. In 1936, a total of 8.4 million tons of foreign ships entered and exited the port, and 7.3 million tons of Chinese ships. In 1946, only 22,000 tons of ocean-going vessels entered and exited, and 2 million tons of river steamers. The threat of the Communist army makes the ships even more desolate, as the China Navigation Company prefers to dock ships in Shanghai rather than sail upstream, where they risk being requisitioned by the government army. Before the war, there were more than 2,000 foreigners in Hankou; now there are only about 50 left. There are still several foreign firms dealing in cotton oil, tobacco, and agricultural products, maintaining small offices, but most have closed, with representatives guarding the company's assets, waiting for the successful conclusion of peace talks between the Nationalists and Communists. They hope that Hankou will one day occupy a position in China's revival. Hankou's riverside has now become a desolate road, with huge abandoned buildings and the remains of burned-out banks and warehouses gradually collapsing. No one thinks of repairing them. Hankou was once known as the "Chicago of the East." Reflecting on its past prosperity is truly overwhelming.

### Recognizing the North Atlantic Treaty as Aggressive; Moscow's Strong Reaction; Supporting the Paris "World Peace Congress"; Commander of Soviet Troops in Germany Summoned Home to Attend Military Conference

[United Press, Moscow, 19th] The international affairs commentator of the Soviet official newspaper Izvestia stated on the 19th that the North Atlantic Treaty is an "aggressive conspiracy against peace." He stated that this conspiracy "is most clearly expressed in the North Atlantic Treaty." Izvestia's reaction is similar to TASS's dispatch from Washington. The TASS dispatch stated that "the North Atlantic Treaty is generally regarded as the main tool of the aggressive policy of the Anglo-American ruling circles. This point became clear after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on January 29. The publication of the original text of the treaty fully confirms this assessment. The drafters of the treaty used false sentences, falsely claiming that they were fighting for peace and adhering to the United Nations Charter, in an attempt to conceal the obvious aggressive nature of the North Atlantic Treaty. The treaty also directly endangers the United Nations. The original text of the treaty proves that it has a military and political nature, stipulating that the signatory countries unite their military forces to take joint military action and stipulating that appropriate military institutions be established for this purpose. It is particularly noteworthy that the treaty stipulates the military obligations of several countries, which are outside the scope of regional agreements, emphasizing its incompatibility with the United Nations Charter. The original text of the treaty makes people believe that its true purpose is to use certain countries by the Anglo-American reactionary circles as springboards and military bases to achieve their aggressive goals."

[Reuters, Moscow, 19th] Soviet newspapers today published a report on the "World Peace Congress" to be held in Paris next month by Britain, the United States, and other countries in a position of one and a half columns, while only a short telegram from TASS in Washington was published on the North Atlantic Treaty, totaling only 36 lines. The newspapers stated that the Paris Peace Congress shows the peaceful aspirations of the Soviet Union and progressive peoples everywhere.

[United Press, London, 18th] The publication of the North Atlantic Treaty heralds the beginning of one of the most dangerous aspects of the East-West diplomatic war. During this period, the Soviet Union will undoubtedly use various methods in addition to force to respond. Western diplomats predict that the Communist political organizations that penetrate every European country will instigate strikes, political demonstrations, and even riots. This "fifth column" activity will not be enough to trigger the mutual assistance clauses in the North Atlantic Treaty. According to the treaty, the Atlantic countries will not consult on dealing with this type of disruptive tactics unless this activity is sufficient to threaten national security. Therefore, the Soviet Union can not worry about its immediate consequences and will continue to strengthen the tactics it has always been good at using. The Soviet Union and Britain and France have signed a post-war cooperation treaty with a validity of 20 years, guaranteeing the Allied countries in the Eastern Hemisphere for peace work. The Soviet Union has already accused Britain and France of violating this treaty and may further declare the abandonment of this treaty, but this action will only have a psychological effect, because this type of treaty has long been unable to be implemented. French Foreign Minister Schuman said that the Atlantic Alliance does not affect the validity of the Franco-Soviet Treaty. At the same time, the British Foreign Office spokesperson also issued a similar statement on the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, but the Soviet Union will not be impressed by this. The Soviet Foreign Office stated on January 29 that the Atlantic Treaty would "trample" on the treaties between the Soviet Union and Britain and France. Western diplomats also fully accepted another statement from the Soviet Union that the Soviet Union must "carry out a more powerful struggle," but they do not believe that the Soviet Union wants war.

[United Press, Berlin, 18th] It was learned today that the commander of the Soviet forces in Germany, Sokolovsky, has left here and returned home to attend a military conference in Moscow. The conference is probably related to the North Atlantic Treaty.

### Acheson Broadcasts to the Nation, Elaborating on US Peace Goals; Declares Western Alliance Complies with UN Charter

[US Information Service, Washington, 18th] Secretary of State Acheson delivered a radio address to the nation tonight, explaining the characteristics of the proposed North Atlantic Treaty, claiming that its most important purpose is "peace and security." Acheson outlined the origins, provisions, and purposes of the proposed treaty. He said, "The United States government, as well as the governments that participate in this treaty with us, firmly believe that this treaty is a necessary measure, the purpose of which is to strengthen the United Nations, deter aggression, and create a sense of security. The latter is necessary for the world's restoration of economic and political health."

Acheson explained how efforts were made to ensure that the treaty was in strict conformity with the United Nations organization. He emphasized that the treaty countries were determined to fulfill it in accordance with the principles and purposes of the United Nations. When tracing the origins of the treaty, he pointed out the obstructive tactics adopted by the Soviet Union within the United Nations, which hindered the United Nations' efforts to maintain peace. He also said that US policy "was formed with a specific purpose, namely, to resolve the major differences that have occurred between nations through peaceful means." Acheson also cited history to show to free countries that to achieve true peace, countries should not only constantly strive for this purpose, but also clearly express that "armed aggression will encounter rapid and effective collective defense action."

### Shaw Criticizes Treaty; Merely a Piece of Waste Paper

[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] George Bernard Shaw told Agence France-Presse this morning that the Atlantic Treaty is just another piece of waste paper. He also said, "That's all I can tell you."

### Wallace Criticizes; Saying it will Lead to War

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 19th] Progressive Party leader Henry Wallace said here on the night of the 18th that the Atlantic Treaty is a heinous violation of the United Nations Charter. He also said that the treaty divides the world into two irreconcilable groups. Wallace called on Americans not to be influenced by the pacifist rhetoric of those who favor it, as it is only a cover action that leads directly to war.

### Western European Countries Unanimously Support

[United Press, London, 18th] Western European countries today unanimously supported the North Atlantic Defense Treaty, recognizing it as the best defense line to deter war and communism, and praised the United States for promoting the treaty. The Communist Party, on the other hand, shouted, accusing the signatories as "war mongers." According to the British Foreign Office spokesperson, at least the United States, Canada, Norway, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg are participating in the signing. This move will unite 250 million people and represent the majority of the world's industrial resources. At that time, British Foreign Secretary Bevin declared in the House of Commons, "The North Atlantic Treaty has created a new era of cooperation and understanding. All countries without aggressive ambitions do not need to fear and worry." Leaders of Western European governments also responded in droves. French Foreign Minister Schuman said at a press conference in Paris, "The North Atlantic Treaty provides France with a strong guarantee against aggression." Belgian Prime Minister Spaak said in Brussels, "The treaty is a major event in history, sufficient to reduce the possibility of war." Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker told reporters in The Hague, "This treaty is extremely important in the current world situation." Canadian Prime Minister Laurent also said that the Canadian people will fully support the treaty. According to a report from Oslo, the Norwegian Parliament is expected to approve the alliance this week.

### US to Implement New Military Lend-Lease Act; Western Europe and North America Re-arm; Atlantic Treaty Expected to be Quickly Approved by Congress

[Reuters, Paris, 19th] Well-informed sources here say: The US government is willing to supply Atlantic Treaty member states in Europe with weapons and military equipment worth 3 to 5 billion yuan within 12 months after the Atlantic Treaty is approved. The new military lend-lease program will be an important part of the Atlantic Treaty organization. Continental military experts believe that Western European weapons are far inferior to the Soviet Union and its satellite groups. If the Soviet Union launches an offensive, Western Europe will have no ability to resist. Everyone knows that the Atlantic Treaty has no practical significance unless Western Europe and North America re-arm.

The true test of the Atlantic Treaty will only occur when all participating countries meet to discuss the collection of weapons and troops. At that stage, it will face two practical issues, namely (1) whether Western Europe will supply the majority of infantry; (2) whether the defense plan drafted by the Atlantic Treaty countries will mainly aim to stop the Soviet army east of the Rhine.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee leaders expect President Truman to urgently request early approval of the Atlantic Treaty. Committee Chairman Connally said he believes Truman will submit it to the Senate immediately after the participating countries sign the treaty on April 4. Connally has notified all members to prepare for expedited action on this issue. It is reported that Truman will, based on the advice of his diplomatic aides, request the Senate to approve the treaty as soon as possible, as they believe that tensions between the Soviet Union and the Western world will rise until the treaty officially takes effect. The Atlantic Treaty unites the eight Western democratic countries under a twenty-year mutual defense agreement. Other European countries, such as Italy, Denmark, Iceland, and Portugal, are also expected to join the treaty before it is formally signed. Congressional leaders generally believe that the treaty is a necessary warning to the Soviet Union and its satellites, making them hesitate and think twice before launching an aggression against Western Europe. However, some senators are concerned about the proposed arms plan. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman McKellar and the committee's leading Republican member, Bridges, both said they hope to know the cost of this plan before approving the treaty. Senator Young said that he is not very optimistic about the plan to supply Western European countries with arms. He is concerned that American-bound military equipment will eventually fall into the hands of any Communist aggressor. Senator McCarran said that he believes the treaty is a necessary defense measure in preparing for the inevitable war against the Soviet Union. He said, "I am sure that war will break out once the Soviet Union can manufacture atomic bombs."

### Willing to Devote Efforts to Economic Recovery; France Needs Peace; Schuman Says Joining the Treaty Ensures Security

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] French Defense Minister Ramadier broadcasted today that France needs peace, and France longs for peace from the bottom of its heart. Because without peace, there can be no freedom and democracy. After pointing out that outside attacks on France for aggression are insulting propaganda against France, Ramadier said that it is definitely not France that has more than two million troops and concentrates its troops on the border.

On the contrary, France has concentrated all its efforts on economic recovery and unhesitatingly reduced its troops. He also said that aggressive war and preventing aggressive war are not what the French people, the French parliament, and the French government want. France will faithfully abide by the Kellogg-Briand Pact, rejecting the use of war as an instrument of national policy.

[Reuters, Paris, 18th] French Foreign Minister Schuman said at a press conference today that after the Atlantic Treaty is signed, its signatories will of course increase the production of arms. Due to the lack of an international army and the restrictions of the veto power, UN resolutions are equivalent to scraps of paper. The Atlantic Treaty does not violate the UN Charter, but rather complements the UN system. Schuman specifically pointed out that the Western Allies, trusting in their common victory and friendship in wartime, have restored their troops and adjudicated their armaments, while the Soviet Union and its vassals have not only maintained their military strength but have not reduced their armed forces. The expansion of the Soviet Union is no longer limited to Slavic lands. Due to its geographical location, France cannot allow itself to believe that it can be spared the threat of conflict.

### Churchill to Go to America

[Agence France-Presse, London, 18th] Thousands of spectators cheered Churchill as he boarded the Queen Elizabeth today to go to New York. Churchill will give lecture tours in the United States and is scheduled to return to England on April 12.

### Britain Concerned about Independence and Integrity of Greece, Turkey, and Iran; Supporting Mediterranean Alliance; Soviet Newspaper Criticizes US Ambitions in Iran

[Reuters, London, 18th] Foreign Secretary Bevin's emphasized statement in the House of Commons regarding the concern for the independence and integrity of countries such as Greece, Turkey, and Iran makes people believe that Britain will actively support the conclusion of the Mediterranean Pact to complement the Atlantic Pact. Diplomatic circles believe that Bevin's words must have been carefully considered in advance and are a major diplomatic policy statement by the British government.

[Reuters, Moscow, 18th] The Moscow "Labor Newspaper" published an editorial today stating that the US plan to turn Iran into its colony aims to prepare for a new war. Iran's seven-year plan is just a link in the plan of British and American imperialism to enslave Iran. Iranian reactionaries, taking advantage of the provocative attack on the Iranian king on February 4, launched terrorist actions against those who oppose British and American rule in Iran. The Iranian seven-year plan was indeed drafted by six American experts.

### Japanese Diet Opens; More Than Thirty Communist Party Members Refuse to Attend; Emperor Hirohito Reads Short Rescript as Usual

[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] Thirty-five Communist Party members of the Japanese House of Representatives refused to attend the opening ceremony of the 50th Diet on the 19th because Emperor Hirohito attended and presided over the ceremony. According to tradition, although the Japanese Emperor has been deprived of political privileges under the new constitution, he still reads a short rescript to the joint session of both houses, urging Diet members to cooperate to make Japan a peaceful and democratic country so that it can return to the international family again.

Japanese Communist leaders Tokuda, Nosaka, Shiga and eight other Communist Party members did not arrive at the Diet building. The remaining twenty-four appeared in the Diet building but did not participate in the opening ceremony. This is because the Japanese Communist Party opposes the preservation of the Emperor system, even though the Emperor has been deprived of political privileges. At the beginning of the occupation, the Japanese Communist Party demanded that Emperor Hirohito be tried as a senior war criminal. Hirohito said: He was deeply gratified to see the improvement in the living standards of the Japanese people and attributed this to the assistance of the Allied countries and the arduous efforts of the Japanese people. But he warned that the Japanese people must not stop these efforts but must continue to strive to correctly understand democratic principles and rebuild a self-sufficient economy. He emphasized that Japan must keep pace with the world "spiritually and materially." This Japanese Diet is facing many serious problems, especially how to implement MacArthur's nine-point economic stabilization plan and how to balance the budget. Although Yoshida's extremely conservative cabinet has an absolute majority in the Diet, due to the surge in the number of Japanese Communist Party seats, they will obviously do their best to put the cabinet in a difficult position.

### Yoshida to Visit Dodge to Discuss Budget Problems

Diet Policy Address Postponed to the 26th

[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 19th Dispatch] Regarding the budget problem, the opinion of MacArthur Headquarters and the promise of the Liberal Party have always been in opposition. Ikeda shuttled back and forth, but no satisfactory result was achieved. It eventually became necessary to find a political solution. According to Mr. Ikeda, Prime Minister Yoshida, although ill, has now decided to personally negotiate with Economic Advisor Dodge of MacArthur Headquarters to seek a compromise on the budget issue.

[Another Dispatch] Cabinet Secretary General Masuda notified the speakers of both houses of the Diet on the 19th that the Prime Minister's policy address is planned to be postponed to the 26th due to the delay in budget preparation.

### US Will Not Allow Japan to Be Sacrificed to Communism

Speech by MacArthur Advisor Sebaugh

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 19th Dispatch] MacArthur's political advisor, Sebaugh, said in a speech at St. Paul's University here today that the United States will not allow Japan to be sacrificed to communist incitement. The recent declarations by the communist parties of France, Italy, Britain, and Norway against participating in the anti-Soviet war are those of traitors to the nation and the family. Anti-communism must not only be stepped up with vigilance, but also promote democratic measures in all aspects.

### India and Pakistan Do Not Plan to Join the Pacific Pact

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 19th Dispatch] Local authorities have hinted that India will not join the Pacific Pact. Australia's statement on the Pacific Pact largely reflects only Australia's preliminary views. Well-informed sources believe that neither India nor Palestine intends to undertake military missions in the Pacific. It is reported that India is quite interested in starting anew in the Indian Ocean.

### Scope of the Atlantic Pact's Joint Defense Zone

Includes a Population of 350 Million and an Area of 8.6 Million Square Miles

[Associated Press, Washington, 18th Dispatch] According to an explanation by the State Department, the core of the North Atlantic Joint Defense Treaty is the "armed attack" clause, which includes the following four situations: (1) An attack on the territory of any signatory country, including French Algeria in North Africa; (2) An attack on US, British, or French occupation forces in West Germany or Austria; (3) An attack on the affiliated islands of signatory countries in the North Atlantic; (4) An attack on the ships or aircraft of signatory countries in the North Atlantic. In addition, the land included in the North Atlantic Treaty covers approximately 8.6 million square miles, with a population of approximately 350 million. The land behind the Iron Curtain covers approximately 8.9 million square miles, with a population of approximately 295 million.

### Opinion of Most Japanese People

The Atlantic Pact Will Cause War Because the Soviet Union Will Join the Arms Race

[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] Japanese newspapers on the 19th published the contents of the Atlantic Pact with the largest coverage. Many Japanese believe that the Atlantic Pact will cause World War III because the Soviet Union will interpret it as an aggressive pact and join the arms race. Senior Allied officials privately expressed satisfaction with the terms of the pact, but said, "Now, we need a Pacific Pact."

### Japanese Officials Say It Should Be Extended to the Far East

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 19th] Japanese officials and the public have expressed gratitude for the successful negotiation of the North Atlantic Treaty. Cabinet Secretary General Masuda said that he hopes the United States will promote peace and tranquility, not limited to the North Atlantic, and should extend it to the Far East in the future. Speaker of the House of Representatives, Shidehara, said: This alliance is excellent, no one can oppose it. Speaker of the Senate, Matsudaira, said: This treaty is the right path to safeguard world peace. Communist leader Noda said that this treaty seems to be an anti-communist measure, and the Communist Party is not yet prepared to issue a formal opinion.

### Comparison of Strength Between Eastern and Western Blocs

[Reuters, Washington, 18th Dispatch] The combined manpower and resources of the twelve countries that have joined or will join the Atlantic Pact exceed those of the Soviet Union and its satellite states. The strength of the Western countries includes: (1) Manpower exceeding the Soviet system by approximately 15 percent. (2) Steel production capacity exceeding the Soviet system by more than three times. (3) Coal production exceeding the Soviet system by more than two times. (4) Oil production exceeding the Soviet system by eight times, not including production in Latin America, the Middle East, and the Far East. (5) Ocean shipping tonnage exceeding the Soviet system by 34 times. (6) Trucks, buses, and cars nearly 30 times more than the Soviet system. In terms of the number of armed forces, the Soviet bloc exceeds the Western bloc by 25 percent, but for accuracy, each should be compared according to the divisions that are equipped, trained, and ready for combat. These numbers are military secrets and cannot be known to the outside world. The foregoing estimate of resources does not include atomic bombs, the latest American B-36 bombers, and the 731 American warships currently in service in the Atlantic.

### Israel Asks Britain to Withdraw Troops from Transjordan

Israel and Lebanon to Sign Armistice Agreement Soon

The Israeli spokesman also pointed out that the stationing of British troops in Transjordan hinders the progress of Israeli-Transjordanian negotiations.

### Mayor's Desire to Resign Due to Fatigue Is Exceptionally Firm; Chen Liang Appointed Secretary-General of the Municipal Government; Handover Ceremony with Shen Zonglian Tomorrow; Chief of Protocol Resigns with Approval, Director of Civil Affairs Bureau Also Resigns

[Report from Our Newspaper] Municipal Government Secretary-General Shen Zonglian has requested to resign from Mayor Wu due to poor health and inability to withstand excessive fatigue. According to reliable sources, the Mayor approved the resignation yesterday. The vacancy will be filled by Chen Liang. Chen Liang is a native of Xianju, Zhejiang. He served as the Director of the Office of the Central Military Academy, the Director of the Quartermaster General's Office during the War of Resistance, and later as the Commander of the Deputy General Logistics Headquarters. He is currently the Director of the Ministry of Food. It is also learned that the handover ceremony between the old and new Secretaries-General of the Municipal Government will be held tomorrow morning. From the day after tomorrow, Secretary-General Shen will be recuperating at home. He told reporters yesterday that he would cease all activities and does not plan to leave Shanghai. Also, Zhang Peter, the Chief of Protocol of the Municipal Government, submitted his resignation to Mayor Wu yesterday, which was also approved. The vacancy will be filled by Liu Banye, the secretary of the department. Zhang will remain in his original posts as a Municipal Government Advisor and Director of the Confidential Office.

[Another Report] Since Mayor Wu expressed his firm intention to resign, the directors of the various bureaus of the Municipal Government have also expressed their fatigue. Following the resignations of Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, and Yu Shuping, Director of the Police Bureau, Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, Zhang Wei, Director of the Health Bureau, and others have also submitted their resignations to Mayor Wu. It is reported that Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, also submitted his resignation to the Mayor yesterday, but it has not yet been approved by Wu.

It is learned that Mayor Wu's intention to resign is extremely firm this time and cannot be reversed by any personnel changes. There are many factors that prompted his resignation, and his health is also a factor. Wu contracted Burmese fever for more than a month and has not been cured. His hands and feet often feel cold every day, and he is easily fatigued. Doctors have advised him not to overwork.

When the President issued the New Year's Day message, Wu suggested to the President that the current situation should adopt a unified military and political system and firmly requested to resign from the post of mayor, but it was not approved by the President. Later, when Sun's cabinet took office, he repeatedly insisted on resigning, but it was delayed until now due to the lack of a suitable successor. However, Wu has expressed that this time's resignation must achieve its goal. Mayor Wu's intention to resign is so firm that many believe it will become a reality. The Mayor approved the resignation of Director Zhao Zengjue first, and then approved the resignations of Secretary-General Shen Zonglian and Department Chief Zhang Peter yesterday, which are obvious signs. These individuals are all close aides of the Mayor.

### Shanghai-Tianjin Wireless Telephone Users Are Crowded

[Report from Our Newspaper] Following the resumption of postal and shipping services between the National and Communist areas, wireless telephone service between this city and Tianjin has also been restored. Users favor the convenience of telephones, and on the day of the trial call, the long-distance station of the Telecommunications Bureau received 96 inquiries or registered calls from users in one hour. It is estimated that if the number of registrations is accepted, there could be as many as four or five thousand calls per day. However, currently, only a maximum of 12 or 13 calls are made per day, only one-tenth of the previous amount, due to faulty equipment or poor management in Tianjin. The demand for calls to Peiping has decreased sharply in recent days, and more than a dozen calls can be made every day. As for the content of the calls, users are particularly cautious due to the different political regions on both sides, and are limited to inquiries and greetings. Occasionally, there are also business exchanges, but these are absolutely in the minority, because Shanghai and North China have not yet resumed trade, so there is no need to exchange business information.

In addition, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau recently received an electricity order from the Ministry of Communications stating that from now on, for communist-controlled cities that have not yet been notified or have not yet made calls, after the technical problems of call notification and calling have been resolved, they should first report to the authorities, and can only proceed with call notification and calling after approval by the authorities.

### Fan Xuejun Gladly Accepts the "Queen's Crown"; Coronation to Be Held Again During Sakura Season; Immediate Charity Sale for Philanthropic Efforts

[Report from Our Newspaper] The coronation ceremony for Fan Xuejun, the queen of Shanghai's ballad singing circles, which was originally scheduled for yesterday afternoon, was temporarily decided to be held at 11:00 AM due to the excessive number of admission tickets issued in advance, fearing that the influx of art fans would affect order. At the same time, the vice-queen Xu Xueyue and princess Zhang Lijun, who were also selected this time, were performing in other cities and could not make it in time. After further discussion by the "Coronation Ceremony Preparatory Committee," it was decided to change "coronation" to "crowning," and the crowning ceremony was hosted by Ding Baoying, the godmother of the crown presenter Fan Zhiji. As for the formal coronation ceremony, it is said that the committee has reached an agreement with the Shanghai Red Cross Mobile Clinic Business Committee and plans to jointly organize a charity fair on a selected date, inviting celebrities in the city to participate. At that time, Fan will be re-crowned, and the "Queen's Crown" will be sold on the spot, and the proceeds will be donated to the Red Cross as medical expenses. The location of the fair has been tentatively scheduled at the old site of the Lishi Society on Jingshenfu Road, and the time will be in early April, when the cherry blossoms there will be in full bloom.

Yesterday was gloomy all day. The "crowning" ceremony was held simply in a side hall of the Lido Garden. Because it was decided to keep it as secret as possible, there were very few art fans who knew about it and rushed to watch the ceremony. However, the famous artists Pan Boying, Jiang Yuequan, Xue Xiaoqing, Fan Xueping, and others still gathered on time, and the Social Affairs Bureau also sent representatives to attend. The entire "Queen's Crown" is made of 14K gold and is said to be worth about two taels of gold.

### Refugee Representatives Sentenced for Fraudulently Obtaining Rice Tickets

[Report from Our Newspaper] More than 3,000 refugees from Anhui who have come to Shanghai for many years are scattered in eight places in the city, including Fuan Lane, Fumin Road, Manli Bridge, and South Railway Station. Upon hearing that food rations could be distributed, the refugees in each place separately elected Hou Minyi and the fugitive Hu Xianlou as representatives, and then the representatives elected Hu Jimin as the general representative to apply to the Municipal Food Distribution Committee for the distribution of refugee food. In May and June of last year, Hu received the refugee rice tickets for those two months and handed them over to representatives such as Hu Xianlou for distribution. The rice tickets for July, August, and September were distributed by the district office in conjunction with the police station, according to the list. However, Hu Jimin, intending to make money by taking advantage of the refugees' ignorance, claimed that applying for rice tickets incurred expenses for paper, pens, and transportation, and instructed representatives such as Hou Minyi to fraudulently obtain 30,000 to 50,000 Legal Tender or several rice tickets per month from each refugee, and then the representatives handed them over to Hu Jimin for shared use. Upon detection, it was sent to the Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution. Yesterday, Shao Renjie, a judge of the District Court, sentenced Hu Jimin and Hou Minyi to four months of imprisonment for continuous fraud. Hou Minyi received a two-year suspended sentence.

### Two Defendants Scheduled for Sentencing for Selling Coal Without Delivery

[Report from Our Newspaper] In August of last year, Lin Tianfu ordered 150 tons of Bai Jiao coal in Xuzhou. Later, Lin sold 50 tons of the Bai Jiao coal to Yang Jingqing of Zhenye Coal Company, with Cheng Wanli as the guarantor. He received 5 billion in payment and stated that the goods would be delivered at the Maigen Road station before August 22. Later, Lin repeatedly failed to keep his promise, and Cheng avoided meeting him. Yang accused Lin and Cheng of conspiring to defraud and filed a complaint with the District Procuratorate.

### Four Indicted for Searching and Extorting Sailors

[Report from Our Newspaper] Shen Long, Li Yiren, Chen Liangcai, and Zhu Bomao, the auxiliary police officers of the Baiyun Team of the Maritime Inspection Office of the Songhu Garrison Command, extorted gold bars from Chuan Arong, the third mate of the Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's voyage. The District Procuratorate has now completed the investigation and filed a public prosecution on charges of corruption. It is said that Shen and others were ordered to go to the No. 8 Pier of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company at 2:00 PM on January 13 to inspect the Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Voyage that arrived from Shantou. At that time, Chuan Arong, the third mate of the ship, was carrying luggage and took a detour to disembark from a sampan. Shen and others, suspecting his suspicious behavior, ordered Chuan to return to the ship and showed their credentials to conduct an inspection. Shen and others found 16 gold bars entrusted to him by his friend Zhou on Chuan's waist. Shen and others, seeing an opportunity to take advantage, conspired to defraud and falsely claimed that "carrying gold bars disrupts the financial system and should be confiscated according to law." They held onto the gold bars tightly and refused to return them. After Chuan pleaded repeatedly, Shen and others returned six bars. Chuan was intimidated by their power and dared not argue. Later, Shen and others found 40 silver dollars on Chuan, and also claimed that it was an illegal act and should be taken away, giving him a receipt and instructing him to go to the Maritime Inspection Office to claim them. After the incident, they took the gold and silver away. Later, Chuan asked his friend Zhou to report to the Police Department, which arrested Shen and others. To prevent Chuan from making false accusations, they also arrested him in the same case for investigation and prosecution.

### Gambled and Lost, Bought a Gun for Illegal Purposes, Sofa Workshop Owner Arrested

[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Heting, 32 years old, a resident of Tongchang, opened the Heting Sofa Workshop at No. 45, Lane 227, Nanjing West Road. Because he lost too much in gambling during the Lunar New Year and was heavily in debt, he had evil intentions. He went to Hangzhou a few days ago to buy a Japanese-style Browning pistol and 50 bullets from a man named Mao, planning to engage in illegal activities. Someone secretly reported him to the Lao Zha Police Bureau, which sent personnel to search his workshop and found the gun and ammunition in a pile of straw.

### Postal, Telegraph, and Railway Rates: Adjustment Uncertain; Ministry of Communications Order for Adjustment Period Not Yet Received

[Report from this newspaper] The formulaic automatic adjustment of postal, railway, and telecommunications rates was recently resolutely opposed by the Legislative Yuan, which did not approve the measure and resolved to immediately restore the old prices. However, the three bureaus in this city—postal, telecommunications, and railway—have not yet received any orders from the Ministry of Communications regarding changes to the selling prices, so they are still maintaining the new prices. The formulaic automatic adjustment method stipulates that adjustments should be made three times a month, on the 1st, 11th, and 21st. Tomorrow is the date for the third adjustment of this month, but the three bureaus had not yet received orders from the Ministry of Communications as of yesterday, so it is still undecided whether adjustments will be made tomorrow.

### Illegal Operations Case of Tongyi Trust Company: Trial of Nine Defendants Concluded

[Report from this newspaper] Last September, the Shanghai Tongyi Trust Company, one of the four major firms in this city, was ordered to cease operations by the Financial Management Bureau for violating the Banking Law and engaging in illegal trading. The responsible persons, Chen Zhigao, Cheng Zhongfan, Ying Hejun, Feng Yunliang, Chen Gengyu, Cheng Kefan, Chen Zhihe, Yin Qiyan, and Liu Huizhong, were prosecuted. The district court held several trials, and yesterday the debate concluded. The court announced that the verdict would be announced at a scheduled date.

Facts of the Accusation

Chen Zhigao – General Manager, Cheng Zhongfan – Assistant Manager, Ying Hejun – Deputy General Manager and Director of the Banking Department, Chen Gengyu – Director of the General Affairs Department, Cheng Kefan – Deputy Director of the General Affairs Department, Chen Zhihe – Assistant Manager and Director of the Securities Section, Yin Qiyan – Assistant Manager and Director of the Accounting Department, Liu Huizhong – Assistant Manager and Director of the Cashier Department. The company, using its corporate structure, successively violated the Ministry of Finance's regulations for the management of banks and the Banking Law between 1947 and 1948, directly engaging in commerce, hoarding goods and paper, buying and selling gold, seeking illegal profits, dividing the profits, evading inspection by the competent authorities, setting up secret accounts, and deliberately making false records in various related accounts. In August 1948, someone secretly reported the matter to the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, which found that the accounts were inconsistent and that the company was illegally operating in the following ways: (1) On January 31, 1947, under the guise of purchasing Wing On Spinning shares, the trust department issued two checks totaling over 40 million yuan, including check number 21461 for 32 million yuan, which was presented for exchange by Lichang Money Exchange, and deposited into the exchange's account number 263, Yuanxin Yongjin, which was actually the company purchasing gold from Yuanxin Yongjin. (2) The company's Class A current deposit accounts, Weicheng Company and Taiji, were found to be inconsistent. Furthermore, the Taiji account deposited a draft from Pudong Bank worth 1.2 billion yuan on August 9, which was the payment from Wanlong Paper Company for 12 reams of Daolin paper purchased from the company. (3) The company's Yongxing Securities account number 5050 was confirmed to be a dummy account for receiving secret commissions. (4) On June 16 and July 3, 1947, the company extended a blank loan of 2 billion yuan to Kaitai Xiang Kerosene Company. However, the Kaitai Xiang accounts did not record this transaction. (5) The company's securities section falsely established accounts under the names of Yu Chuanrong, Li Yijun, Chen Dingchang, Jiji, and Daoji to collect over-the-counter transaction fees and engage in over-the-counter trading.

### The Weidemai Road Murder Case: Elderly Single Woman Murdered; Body Buried Under Floorboards, Entire Body Decayed; Murderer Left a Note and Fled to Beiping; Motive Speculated to Be Related to Love Triangle

[Report from this newspaper] The small Western-style house at 51 Ben Guo Street, Weidemai Road, Hudong, was previously enemy-puppet property. An elderly Henan woman, Xiong Wang, 48 years old, whose husband had passed away, lived there. She had two sons, the eldest named Shi Fang, who served as an adjutant in the 2nd Regiment of the Taiwan Air Force Ground Guard Group. The younger son, Yuanlin, worked as a technician in a military engineering team in Nanjing. Neither son was married, so only Mrs. Xiong lived in the Shanghai residence. Last month, Xiong Shifang sent a letter from Taiwan to his friend, Zhu Jianhua, asking him to take care of his mother. After receiving the letter, Zhu went to the above address but could not find her, so he left it at that. On the 20th of the same month, Xiong Yuanlin returned home from Nanjing but also did not see his mother. He inquired with the neighbors on the left and right, who all said that they had seen her go out yesterday and not return. After waiting overnight with no news, Yuanlin reported the matter to the Xinshijie Police Precinct, which dispatched police officers to investigate without success. The precinct then reported the matter to the General Bureau for record. Yesterday morning, Zhu returned to the address to look for the old woman and was surprised to see that the house had been sold, and the resident was Wu Senlin, a staff officer of the Air Transport Supply Team. He inquired with the people in Wu's house but still could not find her. As he was hesitating, he suddenly saw a letter on the table addressed to Xiong Shifang. He opened it and read it carefully and learned that Xiong's mother had been murdered, and her body was buried under the floorboards in the kitchen. The murderer claimed to be Jia Baogui. The letter stated: "Mr. Xiong, concerning the death of your mother, I indeed murdered her. The body is under the floorboards in the kitchen. You will understand when you see it. The reason for killing her was caused by your brother and Yuexia. If you want revenge, you can find your brother and Yuexia and kill them. That is the only way you can be both loyal and filial. Sorry to you, Jia Baogui. I have now gone to Beiping." The entire letter was written in pencil, and the postmark showed that it was mailed from Puzhen, Nanjing on March 11. After reading the letter, Zhu was extremely shocked and rushed to the Xinshijie Police Station to report the matter. The head of the precinct, Lu, ordered Liu Lianfang, the head of the Criminal Division, along with patrol officer Su Yongqing, police chief Zhao Bingyue, and police officers Zhu Bingjun and Luo Ziquan, to rush to the scene to investigate. After digging up the floorboards, they found a body. It was wearing a blue cloth cheongsam and bound-foot cotton pants. The entire body was decayed, covered in fine hair, and the face was difficult to recognize. The police officers removed the body and transported it to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for examination, while at the same time issuing a warrant for the arrest of the fugitive murderer. It is speculated that the motive for the crime is related to a love triangle. If the murderer has fled to the "liberated" area, it will be difficult to apprehend him for the time being.

### Changzhou Ancient Tomb: Secrets Initially Revealed; Experts Study Tomb Bricks and Conclude They Are Relics from the Three Kingdoms Period

[Report from this newspaper] The recent discovery of an ancient tomb in the southern suburbs of Changzhou has caused a sensation. Yesterday, a reporter made a special trip to investigate and brought back a tomb brick that had been excavated, which was sent to Mr. Jiang Dayi, director of the Municipal Museum and professor at Tongji University, for identification. The brick has a pattern of ancient coins, but unfortunately, it is blurred due to careless washing. According to Mr. Jiang's observation, it may be the four characters "Da Qian Wu Bai" (Large Coin Five Hundred), which was a currency during the Sun Quan period of the Three Kingdoms. Also, the pattern on the brick is only printed on one side, not on all four sides, which was also common in the early Jin Dynasty of the Three Kingdoms. The bricks of the later Six Dynasties were smaller in size, so he concluded that this ancient tomb is most likely a relic from the Three Kingdoms period or slightly later. The ancient tomb was discovered at Yunjia Dun, near Qinglong Bridge, about one mile outside the South Gate of Changzhou. The area is surrounded by a flat plain, but next to Yunjia Village, there are three mounds rising, large in circumference and about several dozen feet high. The mounds are full of abandoned graves and have always been regarded as piles of ownerless yellow earth. Starting on the 10th of this month, the City Defense Unit constructed fortifications in the area, digging trenches several feet deep around the waists of the mounds. On the 15th, several laborers, while excavating on the south side of the largest mound, covering about seven or eight acres, suddenly discovered a wall made of huge bricks in the soil. Everyone was surprised, and after continuing to excavate and unearthing many bricks, they revealed a tomb door also built of bricks. Thus, the mysterious ancient tomb reappeared in the world.

Door Within a Door, Room Within a Room

That morning, they dug away the tomb door and discovered a hollow, empty chamber, about the height of a person with their hand raised, about six feet wide, and about five feet deep. Each of the three walls had a vaulted door, all sealed with bricks. It was clear that there was a door within a door, and a room within a room, and that the scale of this tomb was very large. In the first chamber that was excavated, several ancient coins and half of a broken sword were found on the ground, and there may have been several "figurines," but unfortunately, due to the gathering of nearby soldiers and civilians, these objects were taken away by unknown persons amidst the chaos, and even the tomb bricks were snatched away.

After the news spread, some people made far-fetched associations, saying that there were pearls and jewels in the tomb, and even celestial boys and girls, which suddenly drove the residents of the entire city of Changzhou crazy. Starting in the afternoon, curious citizens, old and young, flocked to see this ancient site. The Wuyi Avenue outside the South Gate was shoulder-to-shoulder, and Yunjia Dun was packed with people. However, the tomb passage and the doorway were very small, only allowing one or two people to crawl in and out, so most of the curious citizens could only look at it from afar, and the crops along the road were trampled and damaged, which angered the local farmers.

Crowds Obstruct Excavation

Such a crowded audience made it impossible to continue the excavation work. At the same time, the City Defense Unit and the County Government received reports that such a large ancient tomb must contain many cultural relics worthy of archaeological research and should not be excavated casually. Therefore, they sent armed soldiers to guard the site and convened gentry and merchants of the county to discuss the matter. It was decided to organize a committee to submit a report to the Ministry of Interior for approval and then formally excavate. During the construction period, visits will be prohibited to avoid hindering the work. Judging from the size of the tomb mound and the procedures required for formal excavation, it will probably take at least a month to reveal the secrets of the tomb.

The currently excavated tomb bricks are each over one foot and three inches long, over seven inches wide, and over two inches thick, weighing up to eighteen city catties. According to elderly villagers in Yunjia Village, during the Taiping Rebellion, these three mounds were used as campsites for the Taiping army. It is also said that during the first month of the lunar year, the 52nd Army stationed in Changzhou accidentally dug up tomb bricks. The villagers also obtained many of them, but they were not taken seriously at the time. Some were used to fill the ground, and some were sold as ordinary bricks and tiles.

The Place Name is Qinglong Township, Suspected to Be the Tomb of an Emperor

Some people believe that the large scale of the ancient tomb and the thickness of the tomb bricks suggest that it may be more than just the tomb of a famous minister or noble, and may even be the tomb of an emperor. Moreover, because the place name is Qinglong (Azure Dragon) Township and there is a Qinglong Bridge, it seems even more likely that it is the "Dragon" place. However, according to Professor Jiang Dayi, the custom of extravagant burials was prevalent during the Three Kingdoms period. At that time, people believed that after death, people should enjoy more as ghosts, and tombs were made as elaborate as possible. Therefore, even if the tomb is large, it does not necessarily have to be the tomb of an emperor or duke to enjoy this. He has also discovered Han tombs in Suzhou. Also, the current name of the tomb site is Yunjia Dun, and there was a person named Yang Yun during the Six Dynasties who offended the emperor and was executed by waist chop and his body was abandoned in the market. His clan members fled and changed their surname to Yun. However, this tomb may not be the tomb of Yang's ancestors, because according to historical records, Yang Yun was the most vehement opponent of extravagant burials at the time.

### Beiping Style (8)

-- Jiang Xue

Report on a City Before and After "Local Peace"

I have returned to Shanghai from Beiping. After arriving in Shanghai, all I see are phenomena of infighting, division, corruption, and incompetence! I am very anxious about the current government's hope for reform! If the government cannot reform drastically and thoroughly, the possibility of the Communist Party controlling the whole country is very high!

The success of the CCP is not accidental. Although the soldiers in the People's Liberation Army are equally tired of war and want to escape, and the people in the liberated areas have many unspeakable hidden pains; the military development is too fast, and many crises and contradictions are also growing and expanding. But they have many success factors. According to the author's personal observation, the following points are significant advantages that contribute to the success of their revolutionary cause.

1.  The party's organization is strict and strong, and the party's will is unified and integrated. Hard work, service, research, learning, struggle, and sacrifice are the creeds of every Communist Party member. Although this includes many coercive elements, humans are animals with inertia. Without group training, it is not easy to become a firm and forward-moving member. The party is the decision-making body, designing, guiding, and supervising, but it is not responsible for the implementation tasks, and most of the people in power are not party members.

2.  The government has a strong controlling power and thoroughly implements the party's decisions. Pay attention to the interests of the majority and attack a few individuals. The government's grassroots organizations penetrate deep into the vast rural areas and can indeed control the countryside. Cadres at all levels are selected and have a spirit of humility, service, hard work, and diligence. Bureaucratic style and corrupt behavior cannot exist.

3.  There are no vacancies in the army, and strict and excellent discipline is a great guarantee of victory! The soldiers' treatment is not good. Each person only receives more than 3,000 yuan of Beihai currency per month, which, calculated at a ratio of ten to one, is equivalent to more than 300 gold yuan. The staple food is cornbread or millet, and the subsidy for non-staple food is not much either. But their discipline is very good! There is no formalism between their officers and soldiers. Soldiers are not required to follow any etiquette when they meet officers. Everyone sits together casually for meetings, discussions, and chats. Breaking down formalism is the basic work to eliminate bureaucratic style. Before and after each battle, they often hold meetings to discuss and review, and fully develop the spirit of initiative and initiative. Three cobblers are better than one Zhuge Liang, which is their key to respecting the opinions of soldiers.

4.  Not admitting mistakes is the most stupid act. Frankness, self-examination, and mutual criticism are the driving forces of progress. CCP members and cadres often maintain this spirit and fact. Humility and learning are the basic conditions for the success of a career, and the CCP also attaches special importance to these two points.

5.  Scientific and strict intelligence work is the main tool for the CCP to strengthen its political power. They attach great importance to this work and do it very well! For example, the liberation of Changchun was Miss Ma's first contribution, and Wu Huawen's defection in Jinan was also the result of this work. Similar facts are innumerable! No matter how much the CCP opposes the KMT's intelligence work, they not only have not abandoned it themselves, but are strengthening this work. However, their intelligence work is entirely guided by political interests and harms. It is never like those intelligence agents who protect personal interests and commit crimes.

In short, the CCP does have many advantages and success factors, which are by no means accidental, and there is no need to describe them in detail here. The future development of the situation depends on the strength of the opposing party.

The author believes that today's problem is not the achievements of peace talks, nor the merits and demerits of the CCP, but whether the government itself has a way to thoroughly reform. CCP cadres also openly admit that the rapid development of the military situation in the past six months has surprised them as well! This is not because the CCP has any great skills, but only because the KMT itself is too corrupt and incompetent.

If the KMT and the government want to save the situation today, they must reflect on themselves, wake up, and reform thoroughly. This kind of reform is not just a change in personnel, a reform on paper in official documents (such as the so-called high-profile land restriction policy, while the essence of bureaucratic politics does not change), or the amount of foreign aid that can take effect. It is necessary to fundamentally and thoroughly reform the system, style, cadres, and discipline effectively; and unite sincerely and work harder, and then there may be hope. As for those trivial, formal changes, not only are they not beneficial, but they can also have a contrary effect.

I left Beiping and returned to Shanghai. In the midst of this country's hope for peace and the active peace talks, I managed to introduce the situation in Beiping and the Beiping-style peace to readers, although the content is not very detailed, but it cannot be considered a meaningless thing. I hope that the government authorities can have a thorough and effective reform. I hope that the people who are working hard for peace can cherish the country. I also hope that the real and permanent peace of the whole country can be realized soon, then the common people will be blessed! (March 12, in Shanghai)

### National Highway Bridge Pinnacle: Baoji Wei River Bridge Under Construction

— Our Correspondent Song Lin

[Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 14th Dispatch] The Sichuan-Shaanxi traffic route, passing through Guangyuan and Hanzhong-Shuangshipu to reach Baoji, relies entirely on highways. From Baoji to Xi'an, besides the railway, there is also a highway for supplementary travel. Before the war of resistance, the import and export of materials in the Northwest were all transported along the Jing-Hu and Longhai Railways to Xi'an, and then distributed to various provinces by highway. During the war of resistance, the Longhai Railway was interrupted, and Beijing and Shanghai fell. The capital was moved to the mountain city of Chongqing, and the transportation of materials in the Northwest relied only on the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway.

The Wei River flows through the south of Baoji City. Before the war of resistance, people crossed it using wooden boats, which was not only time-consuming but also troublesome. In the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1937], the first wooden bridge was built, with 65 spans, 450 meters long, and could only accommodate one vehicle at a time. People called it the "Old Bridge". During the war of resistance, military transportation was frequent, and the second wooden bridge was built downstream of the "Old Bridge" in the 28th year [i.e. 1939]. That bridge had 103 spans, totaling 560.5 meters in length. People called it the "Military Bridge". As the years went by, these two wooden bridges gradually decayed. Every time the rainy season brought rising waters, they were often partially washed away. They were repaired as soon as they were damaged, barely bearing the arduous mission.

Bridge Construction Plan Launched

In the 28th year [i.e. 1939], the Ministry of Communications had a plan to build a permanent bridge over the Wei River in Baoji, but it was shelved due to the country's financial difficulties. On August 12th of the previous year, a large section of the northern end of the "Military Bridge" was washed away. At the same time, other parts of the bridge were also unable to bear the load due to the decay of the wood. The bridge was then abandoned. At that time, the transportation line across the Wei River only relied on the decade-old "Old Bridge," which was already beyond its service life. However, it was really difficult for it to cope, so it was riddled with holes and often blocked. The 7th District Highway Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications planned to build a reinforced concrete bridge amid all difficulties. Last year, the central government, considering that if the "Old Bridge" was interrupted, and the Ping-Han and Longhai Railways were still unable to operate, the transportation between the Northwest and the Southwest/Southeast would inevitably be slow or even cut off, decided to build a new bridge separately.

New Bridge with 72 Spans

The new bridge is a pure reinforced concrete structure, 576 meters long, divided into 72 spans, each 8 meters long, supported by pile foundations. The bridge deck allows two cars to travel side by side, with a lane width of 6 meters, and sidewalks on both sides, each 1 meter wide. The entire design is a continuous beam slab type, with every four spans as a group, leaving an expansion joint. There are 18 groups in the entire bridge, and the bottom of the beam is parabolic.

The principle of bridge and any other engineering design must be to seek safety, applicability, economy, and beauty. The design of the new Baoji Wei River Bridge also follows this principle. Its load capacity is for continuously passing 15-ton trucks. The Wei River channel is wide and flat, and the thickness of the gravel layer at the riverbed is unpredictable. Therefore, the bridge foundation project is most economical by using concrete piles. Furthermore, due to the continuous beam design, it not only saves materials, but also forms a whole in appearance, rich in simple linear beauty, giving people a strong impression.

Additional Protection Works

The Wei River riverbed is flat and wide, and the main stream shifts from south to north, constantly changing. During the dry season, there are only two or three small pools of water, none of which exceed a few dozen meters. But when the water rises, it is four or five hundred meters wide. In recent years, there are signs of erosion on the north bank, while the south bank is relatively firm. Both bridge abutments are protected by reinforced concrete herringbone earth retaining walls, and stones are filled in cement barrels along both wings. In addition, protection works are built upstream on both banks to strengthen the riverbanks.

The road at the bridge end has a width of 17.5 meters, and is connected to the original roadbed with a gently curved lane. A 2.5-meter-wide lawn is opened in the center of the road as a dividing line for the traffic flow in both directions. Some flowers are planned to be planted on the lawn. Two parks are also built on the side of the road on the south side. When the grass is long, the flowers are fragrant, and the trees provide shade in the future, it will not only increase the interest of the passengers to look out of the window, but also add a leisure place to the noisy and dry Baoji.

Formal Construction Process

The formal construction of the Baoji Wei River Bridge began in October last year. As early as March of last year, the 7th District Highway Bureau purchased, transported, and stored materials, and established a bridge construction office to start the pile casting project. In late April, the communist army disturbed Baoji. Although it was only a few days, the order was not restored immediately, causing the project to be suspended for several months. The main building materials, such as 5,000 barrels of cement and 400 tons of steel bars, all had to be purchased and transported from Chongqing. During this event, the transportation work was naturally also delayed. The pile driving work in the deep-water section, which was originally planned to be completed before the rainy season, could not be carried out according to the original plan. In September last year, Mr. Wu Huafu took over as the head of the 7th District Highway Bureau. In order to quickly complete this important and great project, he established an engineering office and officially started work in October last year.

Open to Traffic Next Month

In late October, the concrete casting of the bridge deck began. At the beginning of January this year, the casting work had to be suspended due to the cold weather, but other work that was not affected by the weather continued. After February, the weather in Guanzhong warmed up, and the casting work was resumed. With the tireless efforts of all employees day and night, more than 80% of the bridge deck project has been completed. The roadbed and protection works at the bridge end are being rushed. If there are no accidents, it can be officially opened to traffic in the middle of next month.

Reasons for the Delay of the Project

In the situation of turbulent times and soaring prices, the difficulties encountered in the bridge construction project came one after another: First, Baoji is a small place, and the contracting project had to seek the consent of the auditing authority before adopting the bidding method of various construction companies at any time to cooperate with the construction procedures. Second, it was not easy to recruit technical employees. It was neither possible to recruit from afar, nor did it take a long time to train locally. But finally, under the principle of training while constructing, the supervisors dared not have the slightest negligence. Carpenters were especially lacking. Even if all the local carpenters were hired, it would not be enough to allocate. In addition, various places were rushing to build national defense projects, which also gave the project no small resistance. When the work was being rushed a few days ago, the local military police checked the identity cards, and batches of migrant workers without identity cards were detained. The original plan to complete the project this month had to be extended.

The most important tool for building a bridge is a pile driver, in order to obtain a solid foundation. However, it was impossible to find a pile driver in the Northwest. Therefore, the 7th District Highway Bureau designed a pile driver itself, using the engine of a car to drive a rotating drum to lift a two-ton pile hammer. When it rose to the specified height, the hammer separated from the hook and hit the pile at high speed, which was quite effective. Two such pile drivers were manufactured and put into operation. Other materials such as cement, wood, steel wire, lead wire, and wire nails, except for wood which still needed to be purchased sporadically, all depended on Chongqing.

Total Cost of Materials and Labor

Speaking of the project cost, 2 billion legal tender was allocated at the beginning to purchase the main materials. At a time when the currency system was increasingly devalued, the project cost approved by the central government often became disconnected from the needs of the project. In September last year, the 7th District Highway Bureau, in view of the urgent timing, had to continue to rush to complete the project. While adjusting the budget at any time according to the price fluctuations, it also pieced together the funds for other minor projects and concentrated its efforts to carry out the project, so that it could be carried out smoothly to the present without interruption.

In total, the Baoji Wei River Bridge project cost approximately 10 million gold yuan from the start to the completion. If all the labor and materials are converted to the current market price, it should be 1.4 billion gold yuan, or 700,000 silver dollars.

The direct or indirect effect of this road connecting the five northwestern provinces and the three southwestern provinces to the Central Plains is unimaginable. At present, the scourge of war is spreading everywhere, and the Northwest is committed to the construction of great projects, which is worth our excitement.

### Shenbao Discloses the Disappearance of Two Girls: Danyang Station Quickly Finds Them and Sends Them to Shanghai Yesterday

Adopters Firmly Refuse Payment, Both Families Willing to Become Adoptive Relatives

Mrs. Wang Longyun, an employee of the Youning Pharmaceutical Factory in this city, brought two girls from Zhenjiang to Shanghai by car a month ago. Readers Sun and Zhong from Danyang wrote to inform us that the two children are now in Danyang, but the exact address is still to be investigated. After receiving the notification letter, this column was about to telegraph Danyang Station for inquiry when Mr. Wang also received a telegram from Chief Qian of the Judicial Section of the North Station Police Department in this city, saying that the two children had arrived in Shanghai. At that time, Mr. Wang was raising 50,000 yuan from the factory to go to Danyang to find them. After receiving the telegram, he was overjoyed and drove to the North Station Police Department. The two daughters were also very happy to see their father. This time, the family was reunited and enjoyed the joy of family affection.

It turned out that after the two girls were separated from their mother that day, they were escorted off the bus by the tea servant. The two children, one large and one small, were kept in the homes of station attendants Wan Aoshun and Xu Baishun of Danyang Station, for nearly a month. After this newspaper published the search notice, Wan and Xu learned that the two children belonged to Mr. Wang. The wives of the two men personally escorted them to Shanghai, accompanied by Zhao Wenhan, a plainclothes police officer from Danyang Station. After Mr. Wang and his daughters were reunited, the wives of Wan and Xu expressed their willingness to adopt the two girls as goddaughters, as a memento of their chance encounter. Mr. Wang accepted the kindness. Before parting, Mr. Wang insisted that the two ladies and Mr. Zhao accept the reward, but they all politely declined. As a result, they only accepted 30,000 yuan for travel expenses and happily said goodbye. The social service department of this newspaper has done its best this time, and has unexpectedly achieved a rapid and accurate effect. In the future, we should work harder to serve the society and fulfill the duty of a journalist. (The picture shows Mr. Wang's wife and two daughters taken on the roof of this museum. Mrs. Wang shed tears of thanks when she came, which further shows her inner pain after losing her children.)

### Central Bank President Liu States: Cash Shortage Can Be Resolved Next Week. Yesterday, the Central Bank Still Issued Silver Dollars at 20% for Deposits of Fellow Banks

[Our Dispatch] Central Bank President Liu Gongyun flew to Beijing on the "Zhuiyun" special plane with Acting President Li at 4:10 p.m. yesterday. Before leaving, Mr. Liu told reporters: The current cash shortage will definitely be resolved next Monday. As for how to solve it, Mr. Liu was in a hurry to board the plane and did not explain.

Later, according to a confidential staff member of the National Bank, the formation of the cash shortage was due to the salary payment period last week. At the same time, the National Treasury had a large sum of military funds allocated, and the discount rates in various places were also higher than in Shanghai. Now that the salary payment period has passed and the military funds have been disbursed one after another, and the discount rates in various places, with the continuous outflow of cash, have gradually become stable. Most of the cash will eventually flow back to Shanghai. At the same time, the cash supply of the National Bank can also be gradually normalized. With this factor, the cash panic is expected to disappear naturally. Therefore, it is expected that from next week, the supply and demand of cash will be brought into line.

[Our Dispatch] The cash panic did not improve yesterday. The business authorities of the Central Bank yesterday convened a meeting of responsible persons from various commercial banks and firms to negotiate that the National Bank would generally issue silver dollars to fellow banks yesterday, based on 20% of the balance of deposits every other day. The price of each silver dollar was still 7,000 yuan, with the aim of supplying silver dollars to the market through various banks and firms. It is estimated that about 200,000 silver dollars were issued yesterday, still in various types of silver dollars. The silver dollars received by some banks and firms were mixed with Spanish silver dollars, Japanese silver dollars, and silver dollars that were not circulating on the market, but the number was small, and the National Bank allowed them to be exchanged. The market price of silver dollars stabilized immediately.

### Gold Prices Weaken

[Our Dispatch] The gold market turned weak yesterday, with a lack of momentum. After the Central Bank sold off the day before yesterday, the loosening of funds eased slightly yesterday, and the underground interest rate rose suddenly. Early in the morning, it was heard that the Central Bank would continue to sell off, and people's hearts were extremely soft. Furthermore, because it was Saturday, the multi-party was burdened with too much interest, and the intention to sell was very urgent. New short positions continued to be thrown out, and sales on the table were frequent, and the market was weak all the way. Because of the overnight weakness in the morning, people's hearts were scattered, and the opening was at 485,490. After the opening, the short positions saw profits, and the multi-party held up the market. The market was flat with a slight downward trend, rising slightly to 490,493. After the high, scattered long positions sold out, falling to 487,490. After the low, scattered short positions covered again, and it rose again to 490,493. Afterwards, the multi-party pulled up the market, exerting pressure. The supply and demand on the table were still balanced, and there was no stimulation from outside the industry. It hovered around 490 all the way. Subsequently, bad news spread frequently, and the people in the gold market were like frightened birds. Furthermore, because the underground interest rate was as high as 75,780 yuan, the selling wind on the table suddenly rose, and the market showed weakness, and the market gradually declined, seeing 480,483. After the low, all parties took advantage of the low price and thought of entering, and it rose again to 487,490. However, the overall situation was still not good, and most people were pessimistic. There were too many short positions in the market, and the market fell sharply again, falling to 478,481. Near noon, the struggle between the long and short positions was over, and it closed at 479,482 at noon. There was no large-scale transaction in the afternoon on Saturday, but because of the decline in the previous market, there was still some opening. The initial opening for Monday's position was 530,540. Afterwards, it was rumored that the gold yuan currency system would be changed to silver yuan notes, so people's hearts were slightly shaken, and the bid price rose again, and it finally closed at 537,540 in the evening.

The US dollar opened at 9,700, 9,800 in the morning. It closed at 9,600 yuan, 9,650 yuan at noon. It opened at 10,600, 10,800 in the afternoon, and closed at 10,750 yuan, 10,800 yuan in the evening.

### Hong Kong Exchange Rate Lengthens

[Our Dispatch] The Hong Kong exchange rate opened at 1 yuan, 4 jiao, 9 fen in the morning, and closed at 4 jiao, 5 fen the night before. The gold yuan opened at 7 jiao, 2 fen per thousand yuan in the morning, and closed at 7 jiao the night before. Hong Kong gold opened at 309 yuan per Hong Kong tael in the morning, and closed at 308 yuan, 5 jiao the night before. The US dollar telegraphic transfer opened at 5.624 in the morning, and closed at 5 yuan, 25 fen the night before. The US dollar forward bill opened at 5 yuan, 22 fen in the morning, and closed at 5 yuan, 24 fen the night before. The US dollar opened at 5 yuan, 21 fen in the morning, and closed at 5 yuan, 22 fen the night before.

### Old Debts of Four Foreign Currencies Exchanged for US Dollar Bonds

Implemented After Legislative Procedures Are Completed

The government's old foreign currency bonds, namely, the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1938] gold public bonds, British and American gold bonds, the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1940] construction gold public bonds, British and American gold bonds, the 31st year [of the Republic, i.e. 1942] Allied Victory US dollar public bonds, and the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1947] (US dollar) short-term treasury bills, a total of four types of bonds. The actual sales, and the principal and interest that have not matured and been repaid as of August 20 of the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1948], were originally stipulated at the beginning of the currency system reform to be exchanged for the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1948] reorganized (gold yuan) public bonds according to the legal exchange rate (i.e. 4 gold yuan per US dollar), and the application registration was started by the managing banks and bureaus on October 1. Later, in order to improve credit, it was revised to exchange for the 38th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1949] reorganized US dollar public bonds according to the face value. This regulation on reorganizing US dollar public bonds has been submitted by the Ministry of Finance to the Executive Yuan for approval and forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. Once the legislative procedures are completed and promulgated, the exchange can be implemented. It is heard that the difference between this public bond and the originally scheduled gold yuan public bond is: (1) The bond is denominated in US dollars, and the principal and interest will be paid in US dollars in the future. (2) This bond is scheduled to be issued on April 1 of the 38th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1949]. All the principal of the above four types of old foreign currency bonds that have not been repaid as of August 20 of the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1948], and the interest as of March 31 of the 38th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1949], will be combined and exchanged for this public bond for recovery. The Ministry of Finance has now telegraphed the Central Bank to notify the bondholders of the above-mentioned four types of old foreign currency bonds who have applied for registration with the managing banks and bureaus in accordance with the original method of exchanging for the 37th year reorganized public bonds to properly preserve the original temporary receipts, so that they can be recalculated and exchanged for the 38th year reorganized US dollar public bonds at that time. At the same time, it has ordered the managing banks and bureaus to investigate. If the holders of the original temporary receipts come to inquire about the exchange of bonds, the above situation should be explained in detail so that they can understand.

### Banks and Bureaus Continue to Dispense: Funds Are Becoming More Relaxed

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday's funds showed a trend of initial stability followed by relaxation. When the market opened in the morning, various industries saw that the funds were already stable with a slight upward trend when exchanging every other day, so they raised the daily lending rates one after another, and settled at 75 yuan to 80 yuan. Floating long positions, fearing that the funds would be tighter again next week, also sold goods for cash lending, and the supply of funds in the market gradually relaxed. Near noon, the daily lending rate had returned to between 60 yuan and 70 yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that some remittances had flowed out, and the financial authorities, in addition to issuing a small number of silver dollars, did not sell off gold, yarn, sugar, and other materials, continuing to show a dispensing trend. In the afternoon, the funds became more and more relaxed, and the daily lending rate also retreated to between 50 yuan and 60 yuan.

Yesterday, the state banks and bureaus still dispensed more than 790 million yuan. In the large exchange, various banks dispensed more than 830 million yuan, foreign firms dispensed more than 30 million yuan, and in the small exchange, various banks dispensed more than 130 million yuan.

### Cargo Owners Sell at High Prices: Rice Prices Soar. Special High Quality Japonica Rice Fiercely Knocks on the 60,000 Mark

The rice market rose sharply as before. Because it was Saturday, the cargo owners increased prices to sell due to the interest rate of two days. The rice market prices all rose by 600 yuan. White Japonica early rice opened at 55,000 yuan, and special high quality Japonica rice approached the 60,000 mark. The rice price in the Nanshi market rose by 7,000 yuan at the opening and recovered by 1,000 yuan at the close, rising by 6,000 yuan. 5,613 dan of goods arrived at the two markets.

Edible Oil

Reaching New Peaks: Because it was Saturday, the cargo owners increased prices to hold on to the goods with the interest rate of two days. As a result, soybean and vegetable oil rose by 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. However, the market fluctuation was very small. Soybean oil closed at 217,000 yuan, and raw vegetable oil at 200,700 yuan. The price of raw oil rose sharply. Jittabug raw oil rose sharply by 40,000 yuan from 280,000 to finally knock on the 300,000 mark. Soybean cake rose by 2,300 yuan.

Flour

The market is still firm. The reason is that the funds are stable, the rice price has risen sharply, and people's hearts are very high. In addition, due to the weekend interest rate, the cargo owners are very strong in increasing prices. Military Ship once knocked on the 20,000 mark, and Lao Che made a high of 21,000 yuan. Wheat bran sales were quite smooth, following the trend by more than 1,000 yuan. The large bag of Fufeng reached as high as 16,400 yuan.

Grains

The rising trend is still fierce. Yellow soybeans are affected by the sharp rise in oil cake. The factories are making every effort to purchase them. Cart soybeans are again raised by half, creating a peak of 46,000 yuan. Shatou soybeans are bid at 43,000 yuan. Pinghu Du soybeans rose sharply by more than 20%. The supply of raw kernels is even scarcer, and they continue to rise. The price of corn rose too much the day before yesterday, and it has slightly eased yesterday.

### Market Walk: Looking at the Stand Patters

During the time of wandering
What can be predicted
Looking at it from afar is too pessimistic
The ocean bubble will deflate

Yesterday's trend in each market was a state of wandering. It is time to wander.

The so-called "should" refers to the different situations of various industries, and each has different "shoulds."

Manufacturers rely on actual sales; the lack of actual sales is not something that has only happened now; but in the current situation, it is even more difficult to move forward.

Not only is there no hope for actual sales to improve temporarily, but there is also a major difficulty now. The high cost of electricity is something that no manufacturer can figure out a solution to.

If the current environment does not improve, then it can be predicted that the problem of layoffs may soon follow.

Secondly, in terms of the situation of the holders of goods, heavy interest is the head stick. Unless it is one's own funds. If you drag in your own funds, and then release interest after throwing them out, you can only say that you are greedy for immediate interests. If you calculate it a little further, you will inevitably suffer.

If you are burdened with heavy interest to hoard goods, the first thing to look at is his ability to borrow and repay debts. The second thing to look at is what he is hoarding?

People who can turn around funds, even if they eat high interest, can also transfer it in and out every day to break even. Then, with a base of five jiao of interest holding up the goods price, it will not be completely hopeless.

But in terms of the present, you can only earn interest for others, and you yourself bear the risk.

In recent years, although commodity trading has long been a football nature, it still has some foundation of actual sales.

Now it's different. Not to mention that there is a problem with sales to customers, even sales on the street are extremely rare. The increase in transportation costs makes it difficult for single-person businesses.

Therefore, the football that is now being kicked is already equivalent to an ocean bubble. An ocean bubble will deflate even if it is not punctured. The day when actual sales stagnate is the time to deflate. Then, if the ocean bubble can be thrown higher and higher at first, it will soon be thrown lower and lower and deflate.

Finally, in terms of the situation of lenders, relying on the base of five jiao of daily interest seems to be somewhat stable compensation. But the situation of manufacturers is like that, and the situation of holders is like this. Unless there is no new funds joining in, then they can still survive in the borrowing and repayment of debts by ordinary people. But this premise is absolutely impossible. Therefore, today's black market interest is indeed higher than five jiao of daily interest; but there may be a day when the black market interest falls below the official interest.

At present, the only pillars that can support the market are probably gold, cash, and silver dollars. Although the storms in the rice market these two days have come as we expected, they are not without a saturation point.

Combining the above, the stock market is also not easy to improve.

However, these views are inevitably too early and too far; tomorrow, if there is a materialization of the gold and silver market, then in response to the surge in gold prices in Hong Kong in the past two days, the market may turn over.

### Four Mines Joint Office Adjusted Coal Prices Yesterday

[Report from this newspaper] The various grades of coal prices at the Four Mines Joint Office were adjusted again yesterday. The new price for foreign coal is 273.220 yuan per ton. The price for Keelung coal is 130.420 yuan per ton. The price for Kai Luo coal is 126.860 yuan per ton. The prices of other white coal, small white coal pieces, and Great Wall coal blocks remain unchanged.

[Report from this newspaper] A large amount of fuel for the power company continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Panamanian vessel "Karlit" and the Texaco Company manager arrived from the Persian Gulf with over 10,050 tons of diesel for the power company. It is scheduled to enter the port in the evening and moor at floating docks 31 and 32 for unloading. Additionally, the Russian vessel "Tibilisth," represented by Moutai Foreign Firm, is carrying 6,000 tons of coal from Vladivostok and is expected to arrive today, scheduled to dock at the Dongjiadu Central Wharf for unloading. The aforementioned coal is part of a barter trade by the China Trust Bureau.

### Wool Shipped to Shanghai

[Report from this newspaper] The new vessel "Sydney Star," represented by Tianxiang Foreign Firm, arrived in Shanghai on its maiden voyage from Australia, carrying a large consignment of wool, totaling over 700 bales. It arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf for unloading.

### Cotton Yarn Sees Another Surge, Cloth Market Halts Rise and Falls Back

Yesterday, cotton yarn saw another surge in price. Due to the adjustment of public utilities based on the cost of living index, factories could not withstand the opening price of 70,000 yuan. Around 10:00 AM, news spread that the price of gold notes was falling rapidly, and external speculation also encountered resistance. Morale plummeted, and speculators, lacking confidence, reduced prices to sell off their holdings. The price briefly fell to 68,000 yuan before recovering to 69,500 yuan at the midday close, a drop of 2,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Trumpet Brand and Great Double Dragon fine cloth each fell by an average of 3,500 yuan.

Four Gentlemen Yuan Hua Ji fell from 67,300 yuan, steadily declining to 64,800 yuan by the end of trading, a final decrease of 2,000 yuan. Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance Yuan Pi Ji rose by 500 yuan alone. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong dropped by 1,900 yuan. The remaining cloths all showed a weakening trend. After the close, there were reports of off-market fire sales, and the market continued to shrink. In the afternoon, Pi Ji traded at 72,000 yuan, but there were no transactions for Longtou.

### Fanliding Sales Active

Fanliding woolen fabric sales have been picking up in the market recently. Both local and out-of-town customers have shown considerable interest. Plain Fanliding is more popular than striped patterns, and light beige is the most common color. Yesterday, first-grade goods from local factories were openly quoted at 36,000 yuan per yard for wholesale, second-grade goods at 32,500 yuan per yard, and third-grade goods at 26,700 yuan per yard. All transactions were on a next-day bill basis.

### Silk Weak

The silk market turned weak yesterday. Credit was tight, and interest rates rose. News that the National Bank was selling gold and silver suggested that credit would continue to tighten. Morale turned soft, especially as it was Saturday, and traders were eager to close out their positions to avoid overnight interest charges.

At the opening, the 120 Bridge instant contract was at 2.1 million, and the next Monday contract was at 2.35 million. Selling pressure was strong after the opening, and actual demand was weak. The market declined to 2 million, and the midday close was 2.02 million. There was no trading in the afternoon.

The foreign exchange certificate market for raw silk continued to rise, and sentiment was bullish. However, due to weak gold prices and tight credit, bullish investors were selling and lending out their holdings, which was quite profitable. As a result, the market was mediocre. D-grade 78 evenness Japanese silk opened at 3.3 million. Sentiment was dismal after the opening, and supply exceeded demand. The asking price gradually decreased, and the midday close for the current day's contract was 3.1 million. There was no asking price in the afternoon.

The silk and satin market was flat and weak yesterday. Off-market gold prices declined slightly, and the prices of yarn and cloth remained stable. Credit was slightly tight, and sentiment was somewhat uneasy. American Asian quilt covers opened at 1.52 million, and there was an immediate attempt to push the price up, rising as high as 30,000 yuan. However, selling pressure increased, and new buyers were cautious. The market weakened, falling to 1.48 million. Before the close, retail investors continued to sell off their holdings, and the market continued to decline, ending at 1.46 million at the midday close. There was no trading in the afternoon.

### Sugar Market Clearly Rising, Secretly Falling

The sugar market was very weak yesterday. Sales were sluggish, credit was slightly tight, and buyers were cautious. On the surface, sellers were eager to sell at high prices, and all grades closed at lower prices at midday. Fourth-grade and half-grade sugar closed at 74,700 yuan at midday, with interest rates rising slightly by 2,700 yuan. Coarse granulated sugar rose by 500 yuan to 69,000 yuan. Most transactions were for loans due next Monday, and the prices of other grades were clearly rising but secretly falling.

### Tea Market Rapidly Advancing

Since sellers felt that the supply of black and green tea was scarce, they were determined to hold on to their stocks. Although Jardine Matheson made an attempt to attack the market for Keemun black tea some time ago, it ultimately failed. However, recently, large dealers in stored green tea, such as Yongxing and Jinlong, also planned to attempt an attack. Whether they will succeed is still being planned. The market trend yesterday followed the external commodity market and advanced rapidly again. The trading of domestic tea was also not active, and the process was quietly strengthening, with prices gradually reaching new highs.

### Tung Oil Sluggish

[Report from this newspaper] A reporter recently learned from those familiar with the tung oil market that after the surge in tung oil prices continued to spread, the market yesterday, amidst the ongoing rise of external commodities, also followed the trend. However, the underlying strength appeared weak. This is because foreign market prices remain low, making exports increasingly difficult. At the same time, domestic sales have declined due to the excessive price increases, reducing purchasing power. If prices continue to rise unchecked, the future prospects are not optimistic.

### China Farmers Bank Carefully Plans to Promote Silk and Tea Loans

[Report from this newspaper] Silk and tea are major export commodities for our country, generating considerable foreign exchange annually. After the victory, the China Farmers Bank was ordered to implement silk and tea loans, which have been quite effective in revitalizing the rural economy, encouraging production, concentrating resources, and promoting exports. Although the loan work this year has been affected by the current situation, efforts are still being made to promote it in order to maintain the rural economy. A detailed plan has been carefully prepared and submitted to the National Bank's discount committee for review. Once approved and implemented, the loan will reportedly be implemented on a fixed loan basis, using the foreign exchange transfer certificate price at that time as the standard.

### Chinese Stock Market Stable, Foreign Stocks Weak, Gold Bonds Show a Good Trend

[Report from this newspaper] The Chinese stock market was strong early, then weakened yesterday, with a slight rebound before the close. The off-market gold market was flat and weak, and speculative funds returned to the market. Furthermore, with consecutive days of declines, various investors considered entering the market at lower prices, so buying interest increased, and the market was strong in the first half of the day. In the middle of the day, as credit tightened and the spot commodity market uniformly reported declines, and there were reports that the Central Bank was selling silver dollars to contract the currency supply, the credit situation next Monday was bound to tighten. As a result, sentiment turned uneasy again, and a soft wind rose again on the surface. The market turned downward. Later, there was buying on dips, and prices stabilized. Yong Yarn opened in the morning with a high price of 6.9 yuan due to the buying sentiment from all parties. After the opening, short positions were covered, and the price rose to 7.1 yuan, 7.12 yuan. Overnight long positions were sold off, and the price fell to 7 yuan, 7.02 yuan. Yarn dealers bought in, and the price continued to rise to 7.1 yuan, 7.12 yuan. Enterprise dealers sold off, and the price fell slightly to 6.98 yuan, 7 yuan. Financial dealers turned from long to short, and the market trend hovered all the way at low levels, falling slightly to 6.66 yuan. Guangdong dealers worked hard to pull up the price on dips, and the price rose again to 6.78 yuan, 6.81 yuan. Finally, the price gradually rose to a peak of 7.15 yuan, 7.17 yuan. After the peak, securities dealers sold off aggressively, and the price fell slightly to 6.59 yuan, 6.62 yuan. Before the close, retail investors repeatedly bought in, and the market stabilized, closing at 6.8 yuan at midday.

Small and medium-sized stocks opened flat in the morning. Later, due to the stable and strong trend of Yong Yarn, sentiment was bullish, and buying interest surged. The midday close was flat and weak again. American Asian, Xinyi, Xinguang, and Jingfu all showed strength at one point after the opening. American Asian rose to 2.05 yuan, Xinyi to 1.7 yuan, Xinguang to 0.575 yuan, and Jingfu to 0.26 yuan. Qinxing to 0.345 yuan. The midday close was still weak. The other stocks that once reached their limit up included Jinglun, Xinhua Department Store, China Underwear, Zhabei Water and Electricity, Jingfu, and five other types. The total transaction volume for the day was 6.288 million shares.

The off-market for foreign stocks yesterday was weak due to reports of weakness in the Hong Kong market. The market lacked the strength to rise. Furthermore, due to slightly tight credit, short positions paid an extra day's interest, so selling pressure was very strong, and the market was weak. Yisha 14,100 yuan, 14,300 yuan. British Union quoted 19,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan. Asian 1.340 yuan, 1.360 yuan, a high of more than half a percent. Wheelock quoted 52,000, 55,000 yuan.

The gold public bond market trend was still high yesterday, opening at 245,000 for buying, then rising to 285,000 yuan. The midday close was 300,000 yuan.

### Export Freight from Chongqing to Shanghai: China Trust Bureau Ordered to Underwrite War Risk Insurance

[Report from the Transportation Control Committee] According to the Transportation Control Committee, our country's export products have always been dominated by agricultural and livestock products such as tung oil, tea, and pig bristles. The production areas of these goods are widely distributed in the interior, and in the past, the Yangtze River was used as the main artery for freight transportation to Shanghai for export. In the past six months, due to the current situation, Yangtze River transportation has been extremely difficult, not only are transportation fees high, but the risks are also great. Operators have retreated one after another, or have changed their routes south to Guangzhou, resulting in daily depletion of Shanghai's inventory and severely affecting exports. In view of this, the Transportation Control Committee is urgently seeking to resolve this difficulty and has also adopted opinions from various relevant parties, and has written to the relevant authorities to restore the war risk insurance for export freight in accordance with the precedents during the War of Resistance. This proposal has now been approved by the Ministry of Finance and has been entrusted to the Central Trust Bureau for handling. The underwriting conditions have been learned to be:

(1) Scope: Temporarily limited to the Yangtze River line from Chongqing to Shanghai.

(2) Subject Matter: Limited to agricultural, industrial, and mineral products and all daily necessities for people's livelihoods. Military supplies, gold, silver, currency, and luxury goods are not included.

(3) Insurance Liability: Adopt the internationally used war risk insurance conditions of the Water Insurance Association.

The Transportation Control Committee has already sent separate letters to the relevant export trade associations for notification. If the war situation can be temporarily stabilized in the future, the opening of this war risk insurance business is expected to make a considerable contribution to Shanghai's export trade.

### Mayoral Cup New Champion: Results Today - Railway vs. China Aviation Final at Yiyuan This Afternoon

[Report from this newspaper] Last week's Mayoral Cup final was postponed due to spring rain and rescheduled for 3:00 PM today at Yiyuan. The new champion of this year's Mayoral Cup will be determined today. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Railway and China Aviation to compete for the cup.

Mayor Wu will attend the match to kick off and present the awards. The champion team will receive a silver cup from Mayor Wu and 15 silver medals from the Football Association. The runner-up team will receive 15 bronze medals. Tickets are available in two price ranges: 800 yuan and 1,200 yuan, and will be sold at the stadium starting at 12:30 PM.

The postponement of the final by one week provides China Aviation with the opportunity to train and recruit players from Hong Kong, which is called "gathering strength while waiting for the opportune moment." If they are determined to win the championship, they only need to borrow three strong players from Hong Kong to secure the trophy. Even if they do not borrow players and only recall old players Tian Rongfa, Zhuang Wenquan, and Liang Mingxing, it will be enough to increase the team's overall strength. Moreover, with the momentum of revival, China Aviation should be able to dispel the panic of losing seven goals to Railway in the league. The young players need to be bold and meticulous, ensuring that both wings take flight, enough to contain Railway's defense. The midfielders should try to control the center field, contain the two inner forwards Lu and Xiao, and fight to the end. The outcome can only be determined after a fierce battle.

It should be known that in the elimination round, one must have the stamina and speed to play for the full 90 minutes in order to demonstrate skills and maintain a good state. However, luck is also an important factor.

Railway still has the same lineup, adopting the short-passing tactics of Jialiliwan, with tacit communication. Gao Baozheng's steady third inner defender, Lu Qingxiang's header, and Zhang Jie's sudden attacks are all advantageous. What they lack is speed and a striker who is good at shooting. The wings are not ideal. However, in terms of strength and experience, they are slightly better than China Aviation. If they have a mindset of fear of loss, they may be taken advantage of by China Aviation. If they enter the field in good condition, they may have a chance to defeat China Aviation, because Railway is a team that requires all eleven players to be in top form in order to perform at their peak. If they do not get off to a good start, they should be calm and respond patiently. Once they find their rhythm, they will naturally gradually improve. It should be known that calmness leads to victory, and impatience leads to defeat. Whether Railway can win today depends on its ability to use strategy to cope with China Aviation, which is coming with all its strength.

### Zhichao is in Poor Condition, Lost to Jingwu 1-3 Again - Yiyuan is Chilly in Spring, Fans' Enthusiasm is Low

[Report from this newspaper] The second round of the Jia Group of the Football League restarted yesterday. Jingwu and Zhichao met at Yiyuan. The spring chill was bone-chilling, and with the threat of rain, fans' enthusiasm was low, with fewer than 500 spectators attending. The scene was bleak. Although Zhichao had Wu Qixiang sitting in the central defense, he could not turn the tide alone and lost to Jingwu 1-3. The first half ended with no score.

In the first half, both sides went all out and were evenly matched, achieving nothing. In the second half, Zhichao scored a penalty kick first, which made them overjoyed. Unexpectedly, the situation changed, and Jingwu sent a free kick straight into Zhichao's net, tying the score. Then, Zhichao's young players began to lose heart, while Jingwu became more energetic, scoring two goals in a row, ending the game at 3-1. Wu Qixiang personally took the field at the end, taking over as center forward and leading the entire army to counterattack, but it was ineffective. Zhichao's goalkeeper Zhang Delong played the pipa greatly, showing that experience is very important in the field.

Jingwu kicked off the attack, and the five forwards attacked fiercely, but were blocked back. Fang Renqiu raised the banner again, ran quickly along the side, and sent the ball in from a distance. Wu Jingren's shot went wide. Zhichao was unwilling to give in, and Zhu Jiazheng dribbled the ball deep, passing to Sheng Peter, who deceived Huang Lipu. Chen Huimin abandoned the goal to meet him. Sheng's shot hit Zheng Deyao's leg and bounced out. Guan Yongchang rushed over and touched it out of bounds. After that, the two sides were at a standstill, and the first half ended with no score. Both sides remained unchanged in the second half. Zhichao's Sheng Peter went on a solo raid, going straight into the penalty area. Yu Qi tripped him, committing a foul. Qian Yunqing took the penalty kick, and the shot went into the net. However, because Zhu Jiazheng broke in, the penalty was canceled and retaken. Sheng Peter took the kick and scored, giving Zhichao the lead. Jingwu was unwilling to give up and launched a large-scale attack. The five forwards infiltrated Zhichao's hinterland. Zhang Delong could not attend to everything, forming an empty goal. Zhuang Xinjia shot, but fortunately Qixiang blocked it. Jingwu replaced Li Rongbang with Wang Guoguang, and the attack was indeed greatly strengthened. Fifteen minutes later, Lu Yide committed a handball outside the penalty area. Wu Jingren took the free kick, and the ball flew like an arrow, straight into the net, tying the score for Jingwu. Not long after, Jingwu came again, riding the momentum. Zhuang Xinjia dribbled the ball straight in, passing Lu Yide and pulling it into the net, scoring another goal, making it 2-1, taking the lead. At this time, Lu Yide left the field due to cramps, and Gu Erlu replaced him. Jingwu's attack was still strong, like fire and tea. Wu Jingren, like Liu Lang, re-entered the paradise. Wu Qixiang went out to assist in the attack, but did not return to defend in time. Wu Jingren seized the opportunity to launch a cold arrow from 30 yards away, heading straight down. Zhang Delong's mind was distracted, and he made a big mistake. The ball slid into the goal through his legs. After this blow, Zhichao's anger rose high. Wu Qixiang and Sheng Peter exchanged positions and took over the command. However, the young players were already exhausted, and the end of the crossbow was no longer able to penetrate the silk. As time ran out, Jingwu defeated Zhichao 3-1.

### Youth Cup Football Replay: Yingguang vs. Pan Team Today

[Report from this newspaper] The Youth Cup football replay, Yingguang vs. Pan Team, is scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM today at Yiyuan. The referee is Jiang Yin-seng, and the linesmen are Deng Xiaoliang and Yue Xiurong.

### Basketball Action Tonight: Hua Lian vs. Macleans Again, Donghua vs. Maoxun No Less Than a Championship Final, Li Team vs. Xinghua Evenly Matched

The Basketball League continues with three women's group matches tonight. The games will begin at 5:30 PM at the City Gymnasium. Tickets are still priced at 500, 1,000, and 1,500 yuan for reserved seating. Sales will begin at 3:00 PM. The Four Dimensions Boy Scouts will maintain order at the stadium.

Xinghua vs. Li Team (Women's Group) 5:30 PM

Donghua vs. Maoxun (Jia Group 2A) 6:15 PM

Hua Lian vs. Macleans (Jia Group 1) 7:15 PM

The women's team will open the show. Xinghua will meet the Li Team again. In the first round, Xinghua lost to the Li Team by a narrow margin of 37-40, a difference of one and a half points. This time, the two teams will not let go of each other. Both teams are equally strong in the women's group, second only to the Green Team, and are vying for the runner-up spot. Xinghua has a gathering of famous players and newcomers, but the fact that captain Wang Huiling has not been able to play has affected the team's morale. However, Wang Shan, Zhu Jiazhen, Wang Zhelun, Qian Mengyue, and others will definitely strive for victory in this crucial moment. The Qian sisters are the soul of the Li Team, and Yao Silian is also a good player. Tonight, in order to maintain their reputation and win the runner-up spot, they will definitely fight hard against Xinghua.

Following is the match between Donghua and Maoxun of Jia Group 2A, which is the main match of the group. The former has won both matches, and the latter has won all three matches. This is no less than a championship final. Tension and excitement are naturally expected. In addition to Cai Yanxiong and Zhou Dayun, who were originally basketball players, the rest of Donghua's team are all famous football players. The entire team has a bold style, charging and breaking through with extraordinary fierceness. Yanxiong, Xianglong, Youliang, Li Yao, and others also have close cooperation. However, Maoxun is also not a pushover. Liu Zhaoren, Zhuo Guanzheng, and others are very agile, and Sun Jiawen's shooting is the key to the team's scoring. It is difficult to predict who will win tonight.

The final match is Hua Lian vs. Macleans of Jia Group 1, which is also a major highlight. Hua Lian's players are known for their excellent skills and talent. The elder Li, Adi, Songyuan, and others need no introduction. The team's newcomers Le Jiazhou and Li Hanting are also outstanding players. Jiazhou's shooting is like divine assistance, and Hanting's charge and break are agile and sharp. In the first round, Macleans lost to Hua Lian by one point and is unwilling to accept it. Tonight, the foreign team is making a comeback with ill intentions. Moreover, the players of the Macleans team are tall and have long arms, and are good at defense. It is not easy for Hua Lian to attack. Furthermore, the foreign players Lees, Bramann, and Coffins are also very fierce. Recently, the team defeated the Shanghai Police 57-42, which also proves their potential. They should not be underestimated because of their past mediocrity. The fact that Pei Feier defeated Hua Lian should not be forgotten.

### Pei Feier Loses Form, Shanghai Police Wins Big

[Report from this newspaper] In the Basketball League, the Shanghai Police defeated Pei Feier again last night, 56-40. The American team was behind 28-21 in the first half, trailing by seven points. Pei Feier defeated the champion Hua Lian and Macleans the previous week, attracting much attention from fans. However, their performance last night was abnormal. Their shooting was lackluster, and they missed many shots. The Shanghai Police, on the other hand, played well and had good luck. In the first half, the Shanghai Police led by as many as eleven points, 20-9. Pei Feier tried to catch up, and the black player Brown ran all over the court. The score difference in the first half was reduced to 28-21. In the second half, the Shanghai Police maintained a six- or seven-point lead for a long time. When the black player Brown was penalized, he angrily left the court, and Pei Feier's formation was completely shaken. The Shanghai Police's shots went in like a string of pearls, and the American team could not save the situation. The biggest score difference was 55-35, a difference of twenty points. The final result was 56-40. In the women's group, John defeated the Li Team 30-18. John led 14-11 in the first half. In Jia Group 2, the Shan Team defeated Chongde 50-25. The score in the first half was 25-12, with a ratio of 2:1.

The Shanghai Police sent Wang Bowen, He Zeng, Shi Jiuquan, Fu Qixia, and Wang Rongsheng to play.

Wang Bowen scored first, and Brown responded. He Zeng infiltrated, and the American team called a timeout. Rong Sheng committed a foul, and He Zeng displayed his power, scoring twice. Parks committed a foul on Little He, and he made both free throws. The Shanghai Police led 10-3. Bowen scored again. Pei Feier's ball often revolved on the rim, and they only scored points through free throws, which was not worth the loss. The score became 20-9. Only then did Brown score five consecutive points with two throws and one free throw, retreating to 21-26. Wang Bowen was injured and left the court, and Liang Yongbiao replaced him. Yongbiao made contributions after entering the court, 28-21. The first half ended with the Shanghai Police leading by seven points.

After changing sides, Qi Xia scored first, and Eckert immediately leveled the score. The two armies tugged at each other. At 32-25, He Zeng committed his final foul and left the court. Wang Rongsheng replaced him. The Shanghai Police's momentum rose again, and Liang Yongbiao scored three consecutive three-pointers. Jiuquan scored four points. The American team only managed to score one long shot, and the score was 29-40. Pei Feier still tried to fight for victory, but the Shanghai Police had strong defenses. 45-33, 51-35. The American team called timeouts many times, but they were exhausted. Qi Xia and Jin Dian scored two points each, 55-35, a difference of twenty points. At the end of the game, Pei Feier lost to the Shanghai Police again with a score of 40-56.

### John Defeats Li Team

In the women's group match between John and the Li Team, John was one step higher. In the first quarter, they were both powerful and prestigious, making the Li Team's younger sisters at a loss. It was a one-sided situation of 6-0. However, in the second quarter, Liang Miaoling and Fan Yu of the Li Team cut through and seized the base, making it a tense situation of 12-10. John's Li Miao committed four fouls and left the court, replaced by Zheng Jingyuan. In the first half, John had 14 points and the Li Team had 11 points. In the third quarter, John's Wu Hanlian and Lin Jingyi attacked separately. The Li Team's defenders were short, which was very disadvantageous. The score in this quarter was 22-15. In the last quarter, Yao Wenda of the Li Team also committed four fouls at 24-15, and Wang Jiahui replaced him. After that, both sides committed many fouls, and free throws were frequent, making the audience feel bored. John's Zheng Jingyuan also left the court with five fouls. Five people finished the game, but John still won 30-18.

### Shantou Team Defeats Chongde

In the Group Two D match between Shantou Team and Chongde, Shantou scored five points immediately upon entering the court, an extraordinary start that intimidated Chongde into calling a timeout. Within ten minutes, the score became 15-5. In the next five minutes, neither team made significant progress. The first half ended with Shantou at 25 and Chongde at 12. In the second half, Chongde showed signs of a resurgence, but Shantou's offense only intensified. Ultimately, Shantou won with a score of 50-28.

### New Venture in Sports World: Radio Facsimile Captures Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race

[Reuters, London, 17th]  The upcoming boat race between Oxford and Cambridge Universities in Britain may be broadcast using radio facsimile. The initial organizers believed that using radio facsimile on a fast-moving launch would be difficult, but after testing, they have achieved considerable success. It has now been decided that during the race, rotating cameras on the launch will capture both close-up and distant shots, transmitting them to eight relay cameras positioned along the banks of the Thames, which will then forward the images to a radio facsimile broadcasting station located at Alexandra Palace for broadcast. Using multiple broadcasting cameras to capture a single sporting event is a groundbreaking endeavor.

### Breaststroke and Butterfly Stroke to Be Separated as Swimming Events

[Reuters, London, 16th] The question of whether the butterfly stroke should be considered a variation of the breaststroke has been a topic of debate for a long time. While most believe that the butterfly and breaststroke are completely different swimming styles, some argue that they should be considered the same. After the most recent Olympic Games, the International Sports Conference considered a proposal from Australia to separate the two swimming styles into two different events. The proposal passed with a vote of 42 to 31. However, the International Swimming Federation also appointed a research committee to study the matter, which ultimately overturned the previous decision. Therefore, the current status remains uncertain. The United States favors treating the butterfly and breaststroke as the same style. The former president of the International Swimming Federation, Mr. Huan En, has expressed his opposition to overturning the previous decision in his capacity as a managing authority. As such, unless the conference to be held in Italy this year ultimately decides to make changes, it is highly likely that the butterfly stroke will continue to be treated as a form of breaststroke in the World Games.

### Hong Kong Tennis Tournament Dominated by Chinese Players

[Hong Kong Air Mail] In the semi-finals of the Hong Kong grass court tennis doubles tournament on the 17th, the four teams advancing to the finals week, following the singles competition, are all Chinese players. Although three of the four matches were decided in just two sets, the victories were not as easy as the scores suggest. Each victory was hard-earned after considerable threat from the opponents. Ye Guanxiong and Li Huitang achieved a decisive victory with two sets of 6-2, but their overall victory was slower than the completion of the first match on court number one, which lasted three sets, indicating that each game was a hard-fought battle. Particularly commendable was the pair of Cai Bingfen and Lu Dingxiang, who, despite facing the best doubles team in Hong Kong, lost by only 4-6 and 5-7 after a valiant effort. Li Wencheng and Chen Decan, both returned overseas Chinese youths from Southeast Asia, have already shown considerable skill. However, the aging lawyer Luo Wenhui, approaching sixty, and the foreigner Hinnell, past their prime, posed a significant threat in the first set, ultimately losing after twelve games, which is also noteworthy. Based on the observations of the past two days, I believe that Ye Guanxiong not only has a high chance of winning the singles title this year, but also, if Li Huitang can perform to his potential, they have a chance of winning the doubles title as well.

### Women's Basketball Techniques

— Translated and Described by Qi Gong

Illustration 6:  In the attacker's mindset, "advance where there is an opening, stop where there is resistance." The defender's response should be cautious, fearing that a single failure will lead to complete collapse. Therefore, carefully assess and adapt to the enemy's formation." This is the essence of the moving zone defense.

The diagram shows the right guard. The attacker being guarded no longer has possession of the ball. The guard should shift her position to guard another attacker with the ball. When the center guard sees the right guard moving to guard the ball carrier, she must immediately retreat to the second line of defense to restore the original defensive formation.

Illustration 7: The right guard continues to guard the attacker with the ball. The curved lines in the diagram indicate the player's planned running route. If the ball is passed further into the same zone, the center guard rushes forward to guard the ball carrier. If the ball is passed to the right corner, the left guard runs to the right side of the basket to guard the ball carrier, while the center guard quickly returns to the area between the basket and the free-throw line to guard that zone. In this fourth shifting formation, the left guard is the third line of defense. She must be aware of other attackers who may have a chance to receive the ball, as this area is close to the basket and is a dangerous scoring zone for the attackers. If the ball is passed by the attacker far to the left of the basket, the left guard rushes from her original position towards the ball carrier to guard her. The center guard remains in the central second line of defense. The right guard retreats to the third line of defense as shown in Figure 3. The key to effectively using these four shifting zone formations is to have tacit communication.

While basketball defensive tactics have improved, so have more sophisticated offensive tactics to break through advanced defenses. "Using wisdom against wisdom" and "using deception against deception" still require skill. If one does not carefully assess the enemy's situation and employ offensive tactics accordingly, it will be difficult to break through their defensive formation. Therefore, Tai Gong said, "The art of winning battles is to closely observe the enemy's opportunities and quickly seize the advantages, then strike swiftly and unexpectedly" to achieve success.

In actual games, the attacking team will naturally use various methods to attack the defending team's shifting zone defense. As mentioned above, attacking teams sometimes use three attackers concentrated in one zone to pressure one zone of the defense. However, attacking teams can also use a fast-paced offense to break through the shifting zone defense. This method involves making quick passes back and forth along the eastern sideline to force the defending team's guards to shift to the eastern sideline to defend. In this way, as long as the attackers can execute quick passes and long diagonal passes across the court, the attacker on the western side can easily get a chance to shoot. Because the defending team's guards may not have enough time to shift their zone to guard the attacker suddenly appearing on the western side, the guards are out of reach. However, using a three-line shifting zone defense can effectively counter this offensive tactic. One only needs to maintain the area within the zone during the shift, filling the gaps in the three lines of defense to intercept the opponent's passes. Then the attackers will inevitably encounter obstacles. The guards in the back two lines do not necessarily need to stand behind the backs of the guards in the front line. This point must be noted.

### The "Need" Chapter

— Liu Sui

I remember it was a long time ago when there was a dispute between labor and management in the movie theater industry. The labor side told everyone how ruthless the management was, making so much money but still treating employees extremely harshly. It seemed that all the movie theaters were showing the most boring and low-brow films from Hollywood. I once innocently asked them: Do such bad movies still make money? Their answer was brilliant: What does it matter if the movie is bad? Shanghai people "need" it! The more boring, the bigger the box office!

"Need" is indeed the most realistic thing. People need rice and coal briquettes. People sometimes need to watch plays and smoke cigarettes, which is understandable. But Shanghai people need even more than these things. There are many examples right in front of us: Fan Xuejun was hailed as the queen of Suzhou storytelling, and several newspapers and magazines condemned this event. The reason was correct: in times of national crisis, indulging in entertainment is detrimental. But I heard that 5,000 tickets were printed for the coronation ceremony, and they were snatched up in an instant. Later, many people asked for favors to get a few tickets to attend the event. I believe that condemnation will not have much impact on the event itself, because people need it!

Then there is the case of Mr. Sun Ke and Ms. Lan Ni, which has been making headlines for the past two days. Supervisory committee members have filed impeachment charges, reportedly fearing that "national discipline will be unraveled and integrity in officialdom will be lost." In fact, Shanghai people are no less concerned about this matter than the supervisory committee members. In many situations, I often hear people asking each other: "Do you know about Lan Ni's past..." Because Lan Ni is a woman, especially a woman with a scandalous story, everyone "needs" to investigate and inquire. Clearly, Lan Ni's significance in the hearts of the general public outweighs "discipline and integrity."

As soon as you turn on the radio, you can hear a series of soft and saccharine so-called popular songs. Since the songs are called popular, it is of course because the public eagerly "needs" them. The Sui Book records that in the early years of the Kaihuang era, there was a musician named Wan Baochang who wept upon hearing the music played by the Tai Chang Temple. It is said that he claimed that those musical sounds were "licentious and mournful," the sounds of a dying country. History has proven that by the end of the Daye era, "the world was killing each other to the point of exhaustion." I have a rudimentary understanding of music. In my imagination, the "plaintive and licentious, not elegant and proper music" that Wan Baochang referred to at that time, and the popular songs that "use Xiaolü as Bianzhi, violating the principles of mutual generation," may not be the same as the set of songs that are sung with a crying sound through the nose today, such as "Your eyes are darting around, can't stop looking," etc. Otherwise, people have the wisdom to choose what they like and dislike. If those "song selections"—more abundant than Beethoven's complete works—truly foreshadow "the world killing each other to the point of exhaustion," why is everyone making "song request calls" like snowflakes every day, needing them so sincerely and earnestly?

One day, I happened to see an elderly foreigner in a lending library in the central district, diligently burying himself in reading. The man's clothes were not neat, and he seemed extremely devout as he pored over the thick, original book. The book cover seemed to have the words "Shakespeare" on it. I wondered to myself, how could this old man "need" Shakespeare? Before I could decide, I noticed two young men behind him fighting over a picture magazine. One of them said to the other: Don't fight, I'm treating tonight to see Tong Zhiling's "Splitting the Spinning Wheel"! As he spoke, he pulled out what looked like a theater program from his side, looking smug. I took a cold breath and retreated. To this day, I still believe that there must have been countless young men that night who were desperately trying to buy tickets because they "needed" to see the gyrating hips and listen to the high-pitched singing of "Beijing Opera"!

### The Story of a New Suit

— Bifeng

In Belfort, Ireland, the acquisition of clothing is strictly limited. A local resident traveled to Dublin in southern Ireland, where nothing is restricted. So he bought an entire suit - including shirts, shoes, a hat, even underwear, and ties. He put all the new clothes in a trunk and asked a porter to send the trunk to the train to Belfort the next day. His plan was to change into the new clothes before the train arrived, throwing away the old clothes, so as to avoid trouble with the Belfort customs.

The next day, after the train started, he took the trunk, locked himself in the restroom - took off his old clothes, and immediately threw them out the window. But when he opened the trunk, he was shocked to find that it was completely empty except for an old telephone book and a bunch of newspapers.

### The Miracle of Artificial Jewelry

— Cang Yu

If you saw an order form from a jewelry store that read, "Two hundred feet of ruby on a stick," would you think the jeweler was being absurd and ridiculous?

In fact, not at all. He can certainly place such an order and be sure to get such goods.

Farmers know that in the warm summer, asparagus can sometimes grow half an inch in an hour. Does that surprise you? But the growth rate of asparagus is not as fast as that of rubies, which is truly amazing. At the Linde Artificial Jewelry Factory in Indiana, USA, rubies grow hundreds of miles a year in its roaring furnaces.

The Linde Artificial Jewelry Factory is a leading manufacturer of artificial jewelry in the world. Its new inventions are endless, and its exquisite workmanship rivals that of natural jewelry. Unless you are an experienced jeweler or expert, you can't tell the difference between real and fake.

You can buy a two-foot long and two-foot thick piece of ruby at the Linde Artificial Jewelry Factory for only $1,500. Jewelers can cut it piece by piece and make various kinds of jewelry. The birth of such a large-scale artificial ruby is a major change in the world jewelry market.

The Linde Artificial Jewelry Factory has now invented a way to create a six-ray star on a ruby, which is much more beautiful than a simple natural ruby. A natural ruby worth one million dollars can be bought for only $750 if it is made artificially.

They have also invented a new gemstone called "Luminous Stone." Its brilliant light is dazzling. The most special thing about this new gemstone is that it shines even brighter under electric light, so it is very popular.  The factory's research department is now focusing its efforts on experimenting with the manufacture of artificial diamonds. They hope this is the next invention.

Today's artificial jewelry is not only the darling of decorative items; it also has its uses in industry, such as in the manufacture of electrical equipment and medical instruments.

The Linde Artificial Jewelry Factory's business is very developed. Their engineers believe that all naturally produced jewelry can be manufactured artificially, and the imitations are so lifelike that they are even more ingenious than nature.

### Suicides in America

— Cao Guoping

Suicide is very common in the United States. The age of the suicides and the reasons for suicide are different. Professor Miheinovi, of Saint Louis University in the United States, recently conducted a survey, the results of which are as follows:

In the past twenty years, 42 percent of suicides were from people aged 45 to 64. Twenty years ago, only 30 percent of suicides were over the age of 45.

Another survey shows that the suicide rate for whites is much higher than for blacks. Although blacks account for 10 percent of the city's population in St. Louis, their suicide rate is less than 3 percent.

Analyzing by marital status, married people account for 55 percent; single people account for 23 percent; widows and divorcees commit suicide less often.

On average, the most suicides among men are workers. Among women, most suicides are housewives.

What is the reason for suicide? According to a report given to the New York Academy of Medicine by Dr. Kepakrik, suicide is due to "self-esteem" and "self-hate." According to Dr. Ke, a person's suicide is due to his inability to achieve a goal, which leads to disgust for himself and the world. Suicide is an expression of hating the world and oneself to the extreme, seeking to destroy oneself or implicate others.

The best way to avoid suicide is to understand oneself—to seek the stable development of the inner self. Second, religion also plays an important role in reducing suicide, because all churches strictly forbid suicide, and the most devout believers rarely take their own lives. Third, the power of education enables people to understand the value of life, so as to reduce the idea of suicide. Half Success

Too Many Advertisements

A girl went to church for the first time. Afterward, the pastor asked her:

"Child, how did you like it?"

The girl thought for a moment: "The music was very good, but there were too many advertisements."

### Couplet

— Liu Yun

Last night we discussed many anti-Qing stories, from all over the country, rambling without end. One of those present mentioned a character-splitting couplet, which showed great ingenuity, saying that a woman surnamed He married a man surnamed Pan, and someone wrote a couplet to congratulate them: "Marrying Pan, there is water, there are fields, and there is rice; Bringing He, adding people, adding mouths, and adding Ding." I laughed and said: This couplet is good, fortunately Pan has water, fields, and rice, and life can be guaranteed without worry; otherwise, adding people, mouths, and Ding, how can we afford it! The whole place roared with laughter.

### Railway Fare Issues

— Qi Nian

Before the war, railway passenger fares were calculated based on the length of the mileage, so that between stations, even if there were slight differences in the distance, the price would necessarily be different, and although the difference was slight, there would be absolutely no additions or subtractions, which could be called fair.

In the early days of victory, commodity prices fluctuated frequently. As railway transportation was one of the public utilities, prices often remained unchanged, and were adjusted only every few months, so they seemed even lower. However, after the war, the railway adopted a segmented valuation system, and although the routes were long or short, the prices were rarely different. Passengers on short routes felt disadvantaged, but since the cost was so low that they could afford it, they had no complaints.

However, recently public utilities have followed the rise in commodity prices, with prices changing every ten days, making them unpredictable. Railway fares, in order to maintain their own profits, how could they be an exception? As a result of repeated adjustments, the numbers are no longer small, and there is still no difference between long and short routes. Although fares are said to be much lower than before the war, in reality, short distances feel much more disadvantaged. Consider the following example.

For example, from Shanghai to Kunshan, a distance of more than a hundred Chinese miles, the third-class fare is 1,200 yuan, which, calculated at the then rice price, is about four or five jiao before the war, which is still appropriate. But from Kunshan to Zhengyi, a distance of only a dozen Chinese miles, the price is 1,000 yuan, which is about three jiao; and from Zhengyi to Weiting, a short distance of only nine Chinese miles, the price is the same. Compared with the pre-war period, the fare from Kunshan to Zhengyi was two jiao, and the fare from Zhengyi to Weiting was one jiao. Then, compared with the past, is it not doubled? This is all due to the adoption of a segmented valuation system.

Looking at today's passengers, long-distance travelers are mostly freelance travelers and not formal passengers. They take advantage of the price differences between the two places, traveling back and forth with goods, to seek large profits, carrying boxes and cages, making it impossible to maintain order on the train. This was originally what the railway authorities had been painstakingly trying to crack down on, but now they are giving them low fares, which is really puzzling. Short-distance travelers are mostly ordinary people and regular businessmen in towns and cities, who are the real service objects of the railway authorities. They originally relied on the convenience of train transportation to negotiate official business, commercial contacts, and friendly connections with each other, but now they are selling high-priced tickets, which runs counter to the original intention?

The seat prices of ships that assist short-distance railway transportation originally rose and fell according to the level of train tickets, but now they are naturally rising. Thus, under the threat of double high prices, the little people can hardly travel and all complain. In order to reduce the burden on the common people and seek fairness and reasonableness, the railway authorities seem to have an urgent need to amend or abolish the segmented valuation system. If it is said that the income of the railway authorities will be reduced as a result, then the loss can still be made up by shortening the long, so there is no need to worry about gains and losses.

### Before and After the Issuance of Large Denomination Banknotes

— Wang Qiuming

Three movements before the issuance of large denomination banknotes:

(1) The authorities deny it and solemnly refute the rumors;

(2) In response to the requirements of all sectors (it is unclear which sectors), the authorities have given it consideration;

(3) To alleviate the cash shortage, large denomination banknotes are issued.

Three movements after the issuance of large denomination banknotes:

(1) Money supply loosens and floods, and the prices of all goods soar;

(2) The authorities sell off materials or become greatly enraged, but to no avail;

(3) Promissory notes fly all over the place, and returned checks increase day by day. There are rumors in the market about the issuance of large denomination banknotes again.

### A Visit to the Screening of "Sheng Si Hen"

— Chen Yixian

China's first color film, "Sheng Si Hen" (Life and Death Regret), starring Dr. Mei Lanfang, was screened at the Queen's Theater at 10:30 am on March 18th. I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to attend and meet Mr. Xu Jichuan (the film's dramatic arts consultant), which I deeply appreciated. I will briefly write a few words as an introduction to this film.

The director of this film is Fei Mu, and the color sound recording technical director is Yan Heming. In addition to Dr. Mei starring as Han Yu Niang, the important actors include Jiang Miaoxiang as Cheng Pengju, Wang Shaoting as the Flag Soldier Zhao Xun, and others. Those who have seen Dr. Mei's performance of this play on stage will know the story. However, there are differences between films and stage plays. After my visit, I learned that the plot has been slightly modified. First: this film still uses film set design, not stage as a background. Using a stage as a background during a screening would be inevitably stiff and monotonous. Second: the mill scene on stage has been removed from this film, making the whole play more compact. In the nun's scene, the old nun was depicted as a bad person on stage, but in this film, she is portrayed as a good person. This shows the director's foresight. The most exciting scene in the whole play is "Night Complaint," and the ending is particularly good.

The motivation for the release of this film is as Mr. Fei Mu and Dr. Mei have stated. Dr. Mei said: "I have two purposes for filming this movie: the first is that the film can go to many remote and secluded places that I cannot go to. Second, I have learned the art of Peking Opera for decades, and with the help of film, it can be spread among people and provide some reference material for our next generation of artists."

Mr. Fei said: "Dr. Mei and his partners of the era—such as Mr. Zhou Xinfang and Mr. Gai Jiaotian—almost unanimously realized this. They believe that the task of contemporary Peking Opera artists is not only to perform on stage and serve the audience; nor is it only to reform the content of old dramas and forcefully introduce Western-style reforms; the main and meaningful work is to record acting skills that meet the standards, and at the time of the setting sun, when it is fleeting, leave people with some 'rules' for people to criticize and observe."

Although this film is performed in a scenic pose, it still retains the abstract beauty of the old drama and has the unique advantages of oriental cultural art. The singing includes Erhuang Yuanban, Xipi Yuanban, Kuiban (fast tempo), Sanban (free tempo), Manban (slow tempo), Nanbangzi, and Erliu Yaoban. Dr. Mei's various good tunes are all in it. The color is gorgeous, comparable to Western films, and it is indeed a successful work. Those who have seen Dr. Mei perform this play on stage must see it; those who have not seen Dr. Mei perform this play should especially see this film.
