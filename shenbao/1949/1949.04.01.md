### Zhang Zhizhong and Others Fly to Peiping This Morning; Advance Personnel Arrive Safely in the Old Capital; Postal and Aviation Representatives Arrive on the Same Flight

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] A group of sixteen people, including personnel from the secretariat of the government's peace delegation and representatives for postal and aviation services, led by Secretary-General Lu Yuwen, took a Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) special plane from Nanjing at 10:00 AM on the 31st and flew to Peiping. After a three-hour flight, they arrived in the old capital at around 1:00 PM. The special plane flew from Peiping to Qingdao and then returned to Shanghai on the same day. As the peace talks are about to begin, the people of the capital are unanimously placing high hopes on the movements of this advance team. The weather in the capital on the 31st was warm and sunny, with a clear sky and bright spring sunshine, creating a peaceful atmosphere. The special plane took off from Shanghai at 7:30 AM on the 31st, carrying the postal representatives to Nanjing. Li Zhixiong and Lu Chuanming served as the chief and co-pilots, respectively. Also on board were communications officer Zhang Xinran and flight attendant Cao Wuzhuang, who were responsible for providing care along the way. The plane carried a total weight of 2,200 kilograms, including 95 bags of mail weighing 403 kilograms, 32 pieces of luggage weighing 532 kilograms, three boxes of silver dollars weighing 141 kilograms, and the remaining weight being the passengers. The mail carried on the 31st consisted of North China mail that had been stored in Nanjing and Shanghai. Postal workers emphasized that this batch of letters was being taken on this opportune flight, allowing countless family members and friends to receive information, which was of great significance. The list of personnel who went to Peiping on the 31st is as follows: Secretary-General Lu Yuwen, Advisor Liu Zhonghua, Secretaries Zhang Feng, Zhou Guangyu, Zhang Yuechao, Yang Gongshu, Lu Jintang, Ren Baohua (including two decoding personnel), Postal Representatives Mei Yifan, Weng Haoying, Li Xiong, Wang Zhenbai, Shen Xin, Aviation Representatives Lei Zhongren, Jin Shan, and young Liu Jinbo, totaling sixteen people. At the airport, Lu Yuwen announced the organization of the peace delegation, stating that the total number of personnel was 23, including six representatives, one secretary-general, four advisors, and ten secretaries (including two administrative staff and two stenographers), and two decoding personnel. The reason for not announcing the names was to avoid increasing visits and social engagements from relatives and friends of the delegation members in Peiping and Nanjing, thereby reducing their work efficiency, and there was no other significance to it.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The six representatives of the government's peace delegation, along with advisors and secretaries, have decided to take a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) special plane from Nanjing to Peiping at 10:00 AM on the 1st. Preparations have been fully completed. Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, Huang Shaohong, and Li Zheng, the Kuomintang members among the five representatives, attended a discussion meeting convened by Acting President Li on the afternoon of the 31st with members of the Central Political Committee and the Central Standing Committee, listened to the opinions of party comrades, and reported on the preparations. At 8:00 PM, Acting President Li hosted a banquet to bid farewell to all the representatives, inviting people from the Minqing two parties, heads of various departments and commissions of the Executive Yuan, and military and political leaders from various regions who came to Nanjing to report on their work to accompany them. During the banquet, everyone spoke and exchanged many opinions. It only ended at 10:00 PM.

[This newspaper report] According to China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC): the government peace talk representatives Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi and others will fly to Peiping today on the company's "Tianwang" special plane. The special plane is scheduled to fly from Shanghai to Beijing at 7:30 am to pick up the peace talk representatives. At 10:00 am, it will take off from Beijing Ming Palace Airport and land in Qingdao to refuel. The pilots are pilot Chen Ruidian, co-pilot Huang Wenbin, radio operator Huang Wenzhi, and flight attendants Chen Zhiwei and Wu Minding. Usually only one flight attendant is assigned to this aircraft, but this time, in view of the representatives' hard work for the country, an extra person has been assigned to take care of them. Wu Fuxian, the former deputy director of the company's Peiping office, will also travel to Peiping to discuss relevant aviation issues. The "Tianwang" aircraft was originally a C-46 cargo plane, which was converted into a passenger plane by the company's technical staff using all local materials last autumn. The equipment is comfortable and perfect, similar to the "Air Overlord" aircraft.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The advisors to the peace delegation, Liu Zhonghua, Qu Wu, Li Junlong, and Yu Zhenying, were appointed through a political conference on the 31st; however, Yu will not be able to go to Peiping due to health issues.

### Postal Issues to be Discussed Immediately; Contact with Ye Jianying Upon Arrival in Peiping

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The issue of nationwide postal service is about to be discussed in Peiping. The government's postal representatives Mei Yifan, Weng Haoying, Li Xiong, Wang Zhenbai, and Shen Xin took a plane from Nanjing at 10:00 AM on the 31st and will first visit the postal representatives designated by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to begin discussions. Mei and others arrived in Nanjing by CATC special plane from Shanghai on the morning of the 31st and flew to Peiping on the same plane as the secretariat personnel of the government's peace delegation. If the discussions go smoothly, Mei and others may return south to report within two or three weeks before the government's peace delegation, so that postal services can be started as soon as possible. Su Xueren, the representative of the Postal Remittance Bureau who was originally scheduled to go with them, has decided to cancel his trip to Peiping. Therefore, what they are discussing is purely postal services and will not involve postal remittance issues. It is reported that the postal representatives have two missions in Peiping: one is to study the technical issues of nationwide postal service. North-South postal service has already been partially realized, mainly through shipping between Shanghai and Qinhuangdao. However, in addition to maritime transport and some land transport, there are still many routes that can be followed. When nationwide postal service is implemented, mail will be much faster than it is today. As far as is known, the CCP's postal service is still run on a regional basis and there is no unified organization. The implementation of nationwide postal service requires technical decisions. The postal representatives will contact Peiping Mayor Ye Jianying and Peiping Post Office personnel, and then contact other regions. They are also preparing to visit Tianjin. The other mission is to preserve the postal personnel system. For decades, the postal personnel system has been well-established. Those who engage in postal services do so for life, so employees have stable lives and good work morale. It is hoped that this good system can be preserved. Although the postal personnel in the areas recently controlled by the CCP have not been changed, the postal authorities hope that the CCP can take into account the difficulty of establishing the postal personnel system and preserve it. The postal representatives will negotiate with the CCP on this issue, but there are many difficulties and it cannot be achieved overnight. Before boarding the plane, postal representative Mei Yifan told reporters that the nationwide postal service issue can be viewed with optimism and that his trip will focus on technical issues. Mei was originally the director of the Shandong Postal Administration Bureau. When Jinan fell, the CCP firmly insisted that he continue to serve. Mei refused to stay in Jinan and returned south after more than a month. The CCP greatly admired Mei's integrity, so this trip should be successful.

### North-South Air Services Negotiated Simultaneously

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The issue of North-South air services will be negotiated again simultaneously due to the peace delegation's flight to Peiping. CATC and CNAC have both sent representatives to accompany them. The CATC special plane that carried the secretariat personnel to Peiping on the 31st was accompanied by Lei Zhongren, who had previously been to Peiping. The CNAC special plane that will carry the peace delegation to Peiping on the 1st will be accompanied by Wu Fuxian, who is currently in Shanghai and will come to Nanjing on the morning of the 1st with the special plane before flying to Peiping. The representatives of these two airlines will negotiate with the CCP authorities in Peiping, hoping to achieve concrete results, so that the people of the North and South can have the opportunity to travel to and from. According to Lei Zhongren's statement to reporters before boarding the plane on the morning of the 31st, the issue of air services will still be negotiated by the delegation and the CCP, and the airline representatives will provide assistance in technical aspects. Once negotiations are successful, the company will prepare to resume flights.

### Scenes of Farewell: Li Lili and Shao Lizi Particularly Noteworthy

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Among the people who bid farewell to the personnel on the first special plane to Peiping for the peace delegation, two figures were particularly noteworthy: film star Li Lili and the veteran peacemaker Shao Lizi. Li was wearing a gray-edged black coat and new-style sunglasses, fully dressed in Shanghai style, to see off Jin Shan. She interacted warmly with Jin Shan, and Jin Shan jokingly said to Li that he wanted to bring a strand of her hair to his friend in Peiping, which made everyone laugh. When Shao Lizi arrived, the plane's engine had already started, and his wife had already left. The old man frequently asked, "Where has my wife gone?" His wife then returned and said to Shao, "Look, the plane has already flown, I waved to you, but you didn't see me, you were sitting in the car reading the newspaper," with a hint of complaint. Shao replied with a smile, "It doesn't matter," which made the reporters laugh. Shao then left with his wife by car.

### The Legislative Yuan Will Not Adjourn During the Peace Talks

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] As a result of the discussions held by the Legislative Yuan on the 31st, the opinions of some legislators who suggested that the Legislative Yuan suspend its sessions during the peace talks were opposed by a majority and have been canceled. The Legislative Yuan convened two review meetings on the morning of the 31st. One group reviewed the revised standards for the clearing of wartime deposits and loans in the banking industry, and the other group reviewed the proposal to adjust the salaries of civil servants and teachers, but no conclusions were reached. The tenth session of the third session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the 1st.

### The CCP Notifies the Government Delegation That the Peace Talks Will Be Conducted in Secret; The Issue of Journalists Going to Peiping Still Needs to Be Negotiated

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The issue of news reporters requesting to accompany the peace delegation to Peiping has been repeatedly raised by Chinese and foreign journalists to the Executive Yuan, but no results have been obtained. When Lu Yuwen, the secretary-general of the delegation, was asked about it again on the 31st, he replied that he would immediately negotiate with the CCP authorities upon arrival in Peiping.

[This newspaper, Hankou, 31st] The Wuhan Newspaper Association plans to organize a Wuhan reporter delegation to Peiping to cover the peace talks and is currently telegraphing Acting President Li to seek the CCP's consent.

[United Press, Nanjing, 31st] The CCP told the government peace delegation on the 31st that the peace talks in Peiping will be conducted in extreme secrecy and that there is no need for reporters to go to Peiping. It is reported that Li Zongren has instructed the government representatives to negotiate this issue. Lu Yuwen, the secretary-general of the delegation who will fly to Peiping first on the 31st, has been ordered to first negotiate the issue of news coverage with the Communist Party upon arrival in Peiping. The official said: "The government believes that the issue of news coverage is the most important, and the Communist Party's control of radio stations and newspapers monopolizes the interpretation of developments, which is a danger that the government is trying to avoid." The Communist Party's rejection only arrived the day before the entire delegation left Beijing, so it was not possible to change the Communist Party's attitude.

### He Yingqin Flies to Guangzhou

[This newspaper, Guangzhou, 31st] Confirmed information: Premier He Yingqin recently telegraphed the Executive Yuan here, stating that he will fly to Guangzhou from Nanjing on the 2nd to handle the handover matters of the Executive Yuan.

### New Financial and Monetary Reform Plan Revised and Passed by the Political Council; Divided into Three Parts: Finance, Monetary System, and Import and Export Trade; to be Announced After Completion of the Legislative Process

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The financial and monetary reform plan drafted by Finance Minister Liu Gongyun was revised and passed at the Political Council meeting on the 31st and will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review and approval before being announced and implemented. According to reporters' inquiries, the reform plan is due to the fact that the Executive Yuan's policy guidelines regarding the financial and monetary sectors and the previously announced financial and monetary reform plan have many aspects that need to be revised, such as the impact of the customs gold unit system on the credibility of the Gold Yuan currency, and the method of paying commodity taxes, etc., all of which need to be added or deleted. Therefore, a revised financial and monetary reform plan was drafted and sent to the Executive Yuan. After discussion at the meeting on the 31st, it was believed that the spirit and principles of the reform plan were good, but the details were discussed and revised in detail, which took a long time. The plan is divided into three major parts, which are briefly described as follows:

A. Financial Part

(1) Strictly estimate the necessary military expenditures and supplies for this year and make plans. The principle of the estimation is that the allowance and subsidiary feed expenses are calculated in silver dollars. (2) Quickly determine the policy direction for this year and prepare a budget. (3) Revise the financial revenue and expenditure system. The 30% of the land tax that is currently retained will be returned to the local government from the 38th grain year. The local tobacco and alcohol tax and special business tax that originally belonged to the central government will be assigned to the local government, and the restrictions on local taxation will be relaxed so that most counties and cities can seek self-sufficiency. (4) Starting from the 38th grain year, the method of borrowing grain along with the tax will be stopped, and the principal and interest that have been borrowed and should be repaid will be deferred for two years. (5) Customs import duties are calculated in customs gold units. (6) The goods subject to commodity tax should be calculated based on the wholesale price of the market near the place of production as the taxable price. (7) The profit-seeking enterprise income tax in direct taxes should be allocated among the same industry as much as possible. (8) Prepare for property tax so that those who have money can pay. (9) Create a "tax unit" system. All taxes, except customs duties, are calculated and paid in tax units. Each tax unit is one yuan, equivalent to one cent of gold in the market system, and taxpayers can purchase it with Gold Yuan coupons specifically for paying taxes, and it will not be circulated in the market.

B. Financial and Monetary Part

(1) People are allowed to buy and sell gold and silver, and the Central Bank may also do so. (2) Silver dollars are allowed to circulate and be bought and sold, and the government is preparing to mint silver dollars. (3) Foreign currency notes are still prohibited from circulating. The Central Bank should calculate the exchange of foreign currency based on the market price of gold and the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates. (4) Gold, silver, and foreign currency are not allowed to be taken out of the country. Travelers are allowed to carry no more than two market ounces of gold, no more than twenty market ounces of silver, and the total value of foreign currency must not exceed 500 yuan. (5) Those who import gold, silver, and foreign currency, except for the Central Bank, should be subject to restrictions and import taxes. (6) Provide production loans as appropriate, giving priority to the production of daily necessities for the convenience of purchasing raw materials and settling foreign exchange. (7) Organize cost of living index deposits or other value-guaranteed deposits.

C. Import and Export Trade Part

(1) Improve the import and export management system. (2) All foreign exchange and overseas remittances obtained from exported goods should be handed over to the Central Bank or designated bank in full in exchange for foreign exchange transfer certificates of equal value. (3) The Central Bank should maintain a reasonable market price for foreign exchange transfer certificates. (4) The import of tobacco, oil, and petroleum products will continue to maintain the quota allocation method, and the import of food, cotton, and fertilizer will be handled by the government according to other regulations. (5) For those who import goods from abroad with self-provided foreign exchange that fall under the categories permitted to be imported in the previous article, they may directly declare to the customs for import and transit. Those that are subject to quota allocation and government unified management should first be approved by the import and export management agency.

### Fu Bingchang is About to Return to China

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] He Yingqin telegraphed Fu Bingchang again on the 31st, urging him to return to China immediately to take up his new post as Foreign Minister. It is also learned that Fu had telegraphed that he would return to China via Europe.

### Chongqing Releases Members of the Democratic League

[This newspaper, South Chongqing, 31st] Before Zhang Qun left Chongqing, he released the detained members of the Democratic League. It is confirmed that the relevant authorities began to release them on the 31st.

### Discussion Meeting at the Presidential Palace; Members of the Central Political Committee, Standing Committee, and Peace Delegation All Attended; Zhang Qun Arrived in Nanjing by Plane from Chongqing to Participate

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Acting President Li invited members of the Kuomintang Central Political Committee and Central Standing Committee in Nanjing to a discussion meeting at the Presidential Palace at 4:00 PM on the 31st, and invited peace talk representatives Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, Li Zheng, and Huang Shaohong to attend and report. The Acting President said in his speech: "The peace talk representatives are leaving today. I hope that all members of the Central Committee will provide more opinions on the peace talks." Zhang Zhizhong then reported on his trip to Xikou. The Acting President then said again: "In terms of party relations, we should ask President Chiang for instructions, but listening to Zhang Zhizhong's report on the President's expression made me very moved and felt the weight of responsibility. I sincerely hope that party comrades will provide more opinions." The Acting President also explained that various rumors from the outside world were not credible. After finishing his speech, each committee member spoke in turn. Based on the current objective conditions, many believed that both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party could no longer continue fighting, so although there were many difficulties in the peace talks, the chances of success were also very high. Yan Xishan emphasized: "The current peace talks are an appropriate time. As long as we are open and honest, we will definitely succeed." The issue of future news releases was also mentioned at the meeting. It was hoped that it could be released after an agreement was reached between the two parties. The meeting adjourned at 8:30 PM. Those who attended the discussion meeting today included Li Zongren, Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, He Yingqin, Yan Xishan, Zhang Qun, Bai Chongxi, Xu Yongchang, Zhu Jiahua, Liu Jianqun, Fan Yisui, Li Shijun, Huang Shao Valley, Deng Wenyi, Wang Qijiang, and Ni Wenya.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Zhang Qun, the director of the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters, was summoned by telegram by Acting President Li, and flew to Nanjing on a CATC flight at 5:00 PM on the 31st. After Zhang got off the plane, he went directly to the Presidential Palace to participate in the discussion meeting of the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee and Central Political Committee convened by Acting President Li to discuss the peace talks. Zhang came here to provide advice to Acting President Li on the peace talks and to discuss with the representatives before the peace delegation set off. He will only stay in Nanjing for two or three days before returning to Chongqing.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Yan Xishan was very busy attending important meetings in Nanjing on the 31st. The Acting President visited him at 3:00 PM on the 31st, and Bai Chongxi visited him in the morning, but both failed to meet him. At noon, Yan Xishan had a long talk with Zhang Zhizhong at the Capital Hotel. In the afternoon, he attended the discussion meeting of the Central Political Committee and the Central Standing Committee, and after the military conference in the evening, he returned to his residence at midnight.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Acting President Li gathered military and political leaders from various places who came to Nanjing and heads of various departments and commissions of the Executive Yuan at the Presidential Palace at 10:00 PM on the 31st for a military conference, which adjourned late at night. Those who attended the meeting included Yan Xishan, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Qun and more than 20 others.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The method of rationing supplies to public servants in Beijing and Shanghai has been modified by the Political Council on the 31st: (1) The original method will continue to be implemented from January to March.

### Registration for Reinstatement of Dispersed Employees to Begin Today

### Government Entrusts Central Bank to Handle Value-Guaranteed Deposits; Three Types of Deposits: Gold Price, Silver Dollar Price, US Dollar Price; Protects People from Losses Due to Price Increases

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] In order to protect the people from losses due to rising prices, the Executive Yuan decided at its regular meeting on the 31st to entrust the Central Bank to handle value-guaranteed deposits, including three types: gold price deposits, silver dollar price deposits, and US dollar price deposits. This method was drafted based on the provisions of the "Revised Financial and Monetary Reform Plan" proposed by the new Minister of Finance, Liu Gongyun, and was revised and passed by the Executive Yuan meeting on the 31st, and will be handed over to Liu for responsibility of organizing before being announced and implemented. The original method had proposed a "rice price deposit," which was deleted after discussion at the meeting, and only gold price, silver dollar price, and US dollar price deposits were retained. It is reported that gold price deposits are calculated based on the market price of 99.5% purity gold, and the deposit certificates are divided into seven types: 1 qian, 5 qian, 1 liang, 5 liang, 10 liang, 50 liang, and 100 liang. Silver dollar price deposits are calculated based on the market price of the Sun Yat-sen silver dollar, and the deposit certificates are divided into seven types: 1 yuan, 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 50 yuan, 100 yuan, 500 yuan, and 1000 yuan. US dollar price deposits are calculated based on the market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates, and the deposit values are divided into seven types: 1 yuan, 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 50 yuan, 100 yuan, 500 yuan, and 1000 yuan. The various deposits are divided into eight types with fixed terms of 5 days, 10 days, 15 days, 30 days, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Whether or not there is interest, or how much, is determined by the Central Bank in conjunction with the agent banks, depending on the situation, but the same type of certificate rate on the same day in the same place should be consistent. The depositor may decide whether or not to register the deposit certificate, and may freely mortgage or transfer it, and may also exchange it at the clearing house after maturity. The deposit method is that the depositor freely chooses the type of deposit on the day of deposit, and pays the Gold Yuan coupon according to the market price on that day. When the deposit matures, the principal and interest will still be collected in Gold Yuan coupons at the market price on the day (the date of requesting repayment of principal and interest) in the original place where the certificate was issued. The so-called market price refers to the market price at the opening of the market in the morning, and the market price at the closing of the market in the afternoon. The interest is also calculated according to the type of deposit (gold price deposits pay gold interest. When repaying the principal and interest, the gold interest is added to the face value of the gold price deposit certificate, and then converted into Gold Yuan coupons at the market price on that day). This deposit is entrusted by the national treasury to the Central Bank by contract, and the Central Bank entrusts it to other national banks and treasury to handle, and the national banks and treasury may also entrust the public and private banks and firms of the public and private financial industry to handle it. The deposit of the depositor is the responsibility of the handling bank, the Central Bank is fully responsible to each bank, and the national treasury is fully responsible to the Central Bank. In addition to the agreed handling fees borne by the national treasury, the banks that undertake the business are also responsible for the losses caused by price increases. This method will be implemented first in major cities and gradually promoted to various places.

Editorial

### Japan's Budget and US-Japan Relations

The Yoshida Cabinet of Japan and Dodge, the financial advisor to the Allied General Headquarters, are currently engaged in an important consultation, namely discussing the compilation of the 1949-50 Japanese general budget, so that it can be submitted to the House of Representatives for approval and implementation. This is an unprecedented large budget for the Japanese government, which illustrates the future political trends in Japan, the hopelessness of American aid, and the fact that the United States will use its bare hands to control Japan. It also illustrates the unreasonableness of the budget's revenue and expenditure, which even the Japanese financial circles say is unreasonable, and will inevitably discredit the Yoshida Cabinet and increasingly weaken the position of the current regime and the Liberal Party.

Shigeru Yoshida, the president of the Liberal Party, was elected as the Prime Minister by the House of Representatives on January 23 this year, and organized a one-party dominated government, which was entirely supported by the Allied General Headquarters. Yoshida represents Japan's new conservative forces, closely linked with financial groups, landlords, and bureaucrats. This time he re-entered the cabinet with great confidence, and in many measures he demonstrated that his power should not be taken lightly. This was the case for the opposition parties in the opposition, and also for the Allied General Headquarters' interventionist attitude. However, he mistakenly recognized Japan's current position and environment, and his relationship with the Allied General Headquarters began to become unpleasant. This unpleasant fact has recently been further manifested in the issue of compiling the 1949-50 budget. Dodge, the new American head of the Detroit Bank and financial advisor to the Allied General Headquarters, directly interfered with the Yoshida Cabinet's financial budget. The Allied General Headquarters coerced the Yoshida Cabinet to compile a large budget and did not allow the budget to have a deficit, or expect American aid to make up for the deficit, which was an unprecedented attitude. According to the Allied General Headquarters' opinion, Japan's financial revenue and expenditure in the future must completely achieve "self-reliance." The so-called "self-reliance" means faithfully implementing the "Nine Principles of Economic Stabilization" instructed by the Allied General Headquarters to Japan without the support of American aid.

Japan's 1949 fiscal year begins in July this year, so the compilation of the general budget must be completed before the deadline, and passed by the parliament in April, so that it can be handed over to the government as a standard for revenue and expenditure. If there are problems with the budget content, and the parliament does not approve it, the cabinet will need to dissolve and reorganize before the deadline. Therefore, April and May are Japan's political season, and the height of the government party's and opposition parties' antagonism is measured during this political season. Japan's total budget for the previous year was 473.1 billion, and the people's burden was already unbearably heavy, almost causing the Ashida Cabinet to collapse. When Yoshida ran for election this year, he strongly advocated reducing the people's burden and abolishing the transaction tax, thereby winning over voters in small and medium-sized commercial areas, strengthening the power of the Liberal Party, and thus obtaining the position of the largest party in the parliament. Regarding the compilation of the 1949 budget, Finance Minister Ikeda initially planned for 60 billion, but after several consultations with Dodge, Dodge believed that 600 billion was not enough to cope with future revenue and expenditure. Therefore, Dodge strictly ordered the Japanese government to pay attention to the following when compiling the budget: reduce staff and government spending, increase tax revenue, balance revenue and expenditure, reduce costs, not rely on American aid, and be self-reliant. Based on this instruction, Finance Minister Ikeda revised the budget to 700 billion, and requested Dodge to maintain the face of the Liberal Party and abolish the transaction tax, but Dodge did not allow it. As for whether the parliament can smoothly pass the proposal of this 700 billion large budget, Dodge did not estimate it. In any case, with a single order, the Liberal Party will still need to find a way to pass it in the end. Even if the Yoshida Cabinet is reorganized or Ikeda resigns, the budget must be passed, otherwise the credibility of the Allied General Headquarters' control will be questioned. Yoshida and Ikeda are very distressed about this matter, believing that the Allied General Headquarters' interference in Japanese politics has now taken a step further. The Tokyo "Yomiuri Shimbun" editorial on March 23 strongly urged the Yoshida Cabinet to resist the occupying authorities on financial and budget matters, which shows the subtle relationship between the United States and Japan as expressed in the large budget proposal.

The content of the large budget proposal illustrates several points: (1) The United States will not provide financial assistance to Japan in the coming year unless there is a special need; (2) The Allied General Headquarters' "Nine Principles of Economic Stabilization" require the Japanese government to faithfully implement them; (3) The Allied Forces' occupation expenses last year were 170 billion, but this year they have increased to 250 billion, accounting for 40% of Japan's total tax revenue, which is tantamount to increasing the burden on the Japanese people; (4) If the transaction tax is not abolished, the Liberal Party's credibility will be discredited, and the so-called position as the largest party will begin to waver from the opening of this parliament, which is tantamount to encouraging the Japanese people to turn to the left; (5) The Yoshida Cabinet has decided to generally increase taxes starting on April 1, with railway passenger tickets increasing by 60%, postal and telecommunications increasing by 50%, and food prices increasing by 13.5%. After the large budget is established, taxes will continue to be increased. According to a New Asia News Agency Tokyo dispatch, this tax increase will have a significant impact on the daily lives of the people, not only reducing the general purchasing power of the people, but almost making it difficult for the people to maintain their minimum living standards. In a word, the purpose of the large budget is to create poverty in Japan and accelerate the collapse of the Yoshida Cabinet.

Originally, the Yoshida Cabinet had already become a weak cabinet, and it was fortunate that it could maintain its life with the support of the Allied General Headquarters. Now that the United States has abandoned financial assistance to Japan and wants the Japanese government to increase the burden on the people in order to maintain its occupation, it completely proves that the United States will use its bare hands to control Japan in the future. In short, the relationship between the United States and Japan is so subtle, and the chronic illness of the Yoshida Cabinet will only deepen.

### Anqing Is Solid, Suburban Warfare Continues, Communist Army Cut Off by Crossing to Sandbars, Plan to Capture Before Peace Talks Begins Completely Shattered

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 31st dispatch] The Anqing offensive and defensive battles are still ongoing fiercely in the suburbs of the city on the 31st, from Shimen Lake in the west, via Fenghuang Mountain, Dragon King Temple, Wulidun, Qipan Mountain, Agricultural School to Duantang Lake. The invading Communist army, whose numbers have been verified, are Chen Geng's 11th and 12th armies, the Western Anhui Independent Brigade, and three local Communist regiments, totaling about 40,000 people. Starting on the 30th evening, the fighting was particularly fierce on the line east of Wulidun, which was mainly attacked by the 11th Army. The positions near Qipan Mountain were once broken through, but thanks to the personal supervision of General Tan, the National Army commander, the Communist army battalion that broke in was annihilated, except for three or four prisoners of war. Starting on the morning of the 31st, after the air force participated in the battle, the situation has become stable. In addition, more than 3,000 Communist troops who successively crossed or sneaked across from Shankou Town to the Peiwen, Shangguan, and Tiexin sandbars have had their rear routes completely blocked since the 30th after the navy dispatched additional ships. It is impossible for the Communist troops trapped in the sandbars to return to the north bank, and it is not difficult to annihilate them all.

[Our newspaper, Wuhu, 31st dispatch] Chen Geng originally limited his troops to capture Anqing before April 1, which is the beginning of the peace talks, but this plan has obviously been completely shattered due to the National Army's courageous blocking. When the military here contacted Anqing on the 31st, the defending army happily told them: "A strong National Army force has arrived to reinforce, and the defense of Anqing is becoming more and more solid. Although the Qiaotou Fort in Zongyang Town (northwest of Guichi across the river) was actively evacuated on the evening of the 30th, this has no impact on the overall river defense situation, because the Hechikou River Port on the riverside is still firmly held by the National Army."

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 31st dispatch] There is no change in the Anqing battle situation. After Huayang Town on the western border was lost on the 28th, Zongyang Town, an important riverside area belonging to Tongcheng on the eastern wing, was lost on the night of the 30th. The attackers were the 24th Army of Chen Yi's army and about 20,000 local Communists. The defending army was only one battalion, and after a fierce battle, they retreated to Tiebanzhou in the center of the Chenjiang River at 12:00 midnight on the 30th to hold it. Two Communist artillery positions in Yangjia Lao Ya northeast of Anqing were destroyed by air force bombing this afternoon.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 31st dispatch] The Communist army is becoming more and more active in launching its offensive on the Jiangbei bridgehead. Chen Yi's army in the Jiangsu and Anhui area is constantly launching attacks on the Huayang Town, Yi Hui, and Ba Wei bridgehead positions. In addition to the automatic abandonment of Huayang Town, it has been reported that the 27th Army, originally stationed in Taixian County, and another Communist army with an unknown number, have been transferred west to the vicinity of Chaoxian County, and may launch an offensive on Yuxikou, across the river from Wuhu, and the bridgehead positions to the east and west.

[Our newspaper, Zhenjiang, 31st dispatch] Confirmed news: At 10:00 am on the 31st, more than 200 Communist troops from Yi Hui suddenly launched a fierce attack on the Huangjiafen Xupuqiao area west of the city. After a three-hour fierce battle with the defending army, they retreated. The defending army is searching forward.

### Central China Situation Is Getting More Serious, Lin Biao and Nie Rongzhen's Troops Arrive in Xiangfan, With Intent to Launch Large-Scale Offensive on Yisha

[Our newspaper, Xinyang, 31st dispatch] Confirmed military news from Queshan: The two armies of Nie Rongzhen's army, which arrived between Xuchang and Suhe, have mostly moved southwest along the west side of the Pinghan Line. Their vanguard division advanced rapidly southwest to the Xiangfan area beyond Nanyang on the 30th. The Communist army's arrow is pointed directly at Shashi and Yichang.

[Our newspaper, Xinyang, 31st dispatch] According to the military's judgment here: The Communist army in eastern Hubei may launch a key attack at the same time after Nie Rongzhen's army, which is going south on the west side of Shangping Han, has completed its assembly outside Sha(shi) and Yi(chang). Unless the peace talks are successful, this large-scale offensive will not be delayed until after April.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 31st dispatch] It is reported that about three armies of Lin Biao's army invaded south in the area west of the Shangpinghan Line in the latter half of this month. Most of their vanguard troops have arrived in Nanyang, and a part has arrived in the Xiangfan area. It seems that they intend to launch a large-scale offensive on Yisha. Yisha is the lifeline of our upstream river defense. We have made strong deployments. If the Communist army invades south, a major decisive battle will inevitably be staged in the Yisha area.

### National Army in Central Hubei Recaptures Yunmeng

### The Words and Deeds of the Chinese Communists Are Very Inconsistent, Fighting While Negotiating! The Statement That the Communist Army Has Retreat From the Front Line Is Completely Inaccurate

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 31st dispatch] Regarding the issue of both sides issuing cease-fire orders after the start of the peace talks, Director Deng Wenyi said when answering questions from reporters on the 31st: Since peace talks are being held, a cease-fire should be implemented first. However, the rumor that the Communist army has retreated 30 li from the front line has been proven inaccurate by the fact that they are still launching offensives against Anqing.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 31st dispatch] The Political Work Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense published the "Weekly Battle Situation" from March 24 to March 30 on the 31st, stating: "There have been no battles in Guanzhong, Taiyuan, and other places in the past week. The Communist army in Jiangbei has launched its offensive on the Jiangbei bridgehead. The Communist army in Central China is gradually moving east. The National Army is firmly defending its positions and strengthening its river defense." It then described in detail the battle situation on the Yangtze River (omitted), and finally stated: "Looking at the Communist army's military actions along the Yangtze River north bank and in various parts of Central China, they are inconsistent with the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's sincerity in seeking peace. The Communist Party has announced the representatives, date, and location of the peace talks on the one hand, and mobilized a large army to actively attack Anqing on the other hand. Their words and deeds are very inconsistent. In addition to firmly defending the natural barrier of the Yangtze River, the National Army sincerely hopes that the Communist army can also stop fighting and rest as soon as possible, restrain each other, implement a cease-fire first, and jointly promote peace."

After many investigations, it was discovered that Zhang Weigao, the director of the Wuhan Station of the Civil Aviation Bureau who was in charge of repairing the airport, colluded with unscrupulous contractors to embezzle project funds. The Civil Aviation Authority allocated a total of 3.8 million yuan in gold to repair the airport in January of this year, which was equivalent to more than 70,000 silver dollars at the time. Zhang Weigao initially paid 2.8 million yuan in gold for the project, embezzling 950,000 yuan in gold. He then changed the engineering contract under the instigation of the contractor, using existing materials, cutting corners, and forcibly conscripting civilian workers under the guise of military use, saving more than 1.6 million yuan in project funds, totaling more than 50,000 silver dollars. However, the matter was exposed due to the test flight results, and Zhang Weigao fled in fear of punishment on the 28th.

(3) The President believes that there is no need for Vincent, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, to believe that the defense budget should be increased by $1.5 billion. (4) The President believes that there is still a need to implement the anti-inflation measures proposed by the President, despite Congress's proposal to shelve them.

### Syria Temporarily Implements Military Dictatorship: Orders Dissolution of Parliament Yesterday; Zaim Expresses Willingness to Establish Peace with Israel

[Reuters, London, 31st] The Syrian Embassy in London announced that Syrian military dictator Colonel Zaim, due to Syrian President al-Quwatli's refusal to resign, ordered the dissolution of Parliament and the suspension of the Constitution this morning, pending the establishment of a new government. Zaim also issued an important statement, expressing satisfaction with the outstanding achievements of this coup, and claiming that the domestic reaction was good, with the people welcoming his temporary assumption of power.

Zaim also announced that he would immediately re-examine Syria's concessions to foreign countries in order to abolish all unequal treaties. Unexpectedly, Zaim stated his willingness to establish peace with Israel and would begin peace talks with Israel after domestic order is restored. A dispatch from Damascus also stated that Damascus has returned to normal, and banks, factories, and shops have resumed operations.

[Reuters, Amman, 30th] It is reported that Syrian President al-Quwatli has been arrested and imprisoned in a military prison three miles outside Damascus. Syrian Radio issued a communiqué stating that Zaim has begun to consult with former Syrian Prime Minister and current Speaker of the House al-Khouri on the issue of forming a truly democratic government.

Zaim, who is currently 55 years old, graduated from the Turkish Military Academy and served in the Turkish Army and the French Army stationed in Syria. He has a close personal relationship with President al-Quwatli, but he is also a member of the Syrian extremist national movement, advocating for the immediate implementation of social, economic, and political reforms. The movement strongly opposes the armistice negotiations with Israel, the signing of the Franco-Syrian financial agreement, and the agreement to allow the United States to lay oil pipelines in Syria.

### Soviet Union Urges Asian Countries: Do Not Borrow from the United States; Even Less Should They Grant Military Bases

[United Press, Bangkok, 31st] Soviet representative Nenchetina delivered a speech at the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East today, advising Asian and Western Pacific countries not to borrow US debts to avoid being bound by them. The ECOSOC plans to make full use of the resources of member states and fully develop their own industries.

### Japan Launches Signature Campaign: Urging the Convening of a Peace Conference with Japan

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 31st] Starting from April 1st, the Japanese Socialist Party will launch a nationwide signature campaign of 11 million people, demanding an early convening of a peace conference with Japan. The reason for launching this campaign is that MacArthur refused the formal petition submitted by the Socialist Party on March 24, urging the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. A spokesman for US Headquarters said in response to the Socialist Party that MacArthur is doing his best to achieve the conclusion of a peace treaty, and urged the Japanese to pay attention that the peace treaty can only be resolved by the Allied countries and the Japanese themselves.

### UK Parties Debate: Artificial Insemination; Mainly for the Government to Study the Whole Issue

[United Press, London, 30th] The recent ruling by a British court that a child born through artificial insemination is illegitimate has sparked heated debate in the House of Lords today. Lord Merriman said that, according to the Council of Physicians, it is prepared to stipulate that the number of pregnancies from the sperm of one person be limited to one hundred at a time. In that case, anyone can have one hundred children at a time through a doctor's hand. If these half-siblings fall in love twenty years later, what will happen to their offspring? Lord Reading suggested that the government should form a committee to study the whole issue. If this matter is prohibited by law, the effect will be no different from the US Prohibition, and it will be carried out in secret. Lord Brabazon said that a child born through artificial insemination is not born of his parents, and is of course illegitimate. It is generally believed that the person who donates sperm must be physically strong and mentally sound. In my opinion, anyone who is willing to donate sperm must be a complete egomaniac, and his mind will definitely not be sound.

### Index-Linked Deposits: Financial Authorities Decide to Launch

[Our Newspaper's Report] There have been many rumors recently about the financial authorities launching various forms of deposits. According to a responsible person from the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, Finance Minister Liu is considering launching an index-linked deposit, and no other methods have been heard of. The detailed measures for index-linked deposits will be determined and announced after Minister Liu returns to Shanghai.

It is reported that the index-linked deposits will be handled by several banks designated by the Central Bank. The deposits absorbed will be reported to the Central Bank daily. The deposit term will generally be divided into several types, such as five days, ten days, and fifteen days. The index used will not be the cost of living index published by the Municipal Government but possibly the price index compiled by the Economic Research Department of the Central Bank. Since the Central Bank will accept re-deposits, the handling banks will not bear the loss from the index increase, so they should be able to accept the arrangement.

[Central News Agency Report] According to sources from various parties concerned: The Kailuan Mining Bureau, in order to supply the coal needs of Shanghai, has agreed to transport 300,000 bags of flour from this city to North China in exchange for one metric ton of bituminous coal.

### Former Township Head of Lide Township, Batou Town, Haimen County: Sudden Kidnapping While Seeking Refuge in Shanghai
Cousin Contacts for Ransom But Fails to Rescue, Reports to Police and Two Criminals Are Arrested

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Yaoming, a native of Haimen, over sixty years old, rents a residence at No. 46 Xiangshan Road, Zhabei. He was formerly the township head of Lide Township, Batou Town, Haimen County. Recently, due to old age and local unrest, he came to Shanghai to reside. Unexpectedly, at about 8:00 AM on the 23rd of last month, four soldiers suddenly came and took him away. His whereabouts were unknown. It was not until 8:00 PM that night that Wang's cousin, Wang Chongwei, came to the residence and learned the whole story. Just as he was about to report to the police for arrest, a fellow villager, Ding Delin, came with a handwritten letter from Wang, which roughly stated that if 50 piculs of white rice were delivered, he could be freed. After Wang read it, he agreed to raise funds.

At dusk the next day, Ding arrived and accompanied Wang to a certain infantry unit in the South City to meet with a battalion commander. After Wang repeatedly pleaded to reduce it to 30 piculs, Wang paid three gold rings weighing eight qian and four checks totaling 1.45 million yuan. Unexpectedly, the battalion commander ordered him to pay another 150,000 yuan as rewards for the orderlies. Wang agreed again. When he delivered the money and met Ding Delin again at 11:00 AM on the 25th, Ding said that the battalion commander was out and would talk after returning to the unit. When Wang returned to the battalion headquarters that night, Ding and the battalion commander had both fled, and he realized he had been deceived. On the morning of the 26th, he rushed to the bank to stop payment, but found that two checks for 500,000 yuan each and one check for 150,000 yuan had been cashed. Around 1:00 PM on the 30th, Ding suddenly returned to Wang's residence, and Wang immediately argued with him. Ding claimed that Wang was hidden near Sichuan Road and Henan Road. Wang forced him to lead the way. When they arrived there, Ding fled again. Wang followed closely and shouted "kidnapping!" Finally, he was intercepted by a police officer and taken to the North Railway Station Police Sub-Bureau for interrogation. According to his confession, he was 23 years old, from Haimen, and served as an adjutant in the battalion. He denied any kidnapping and said that Wang had been selling opium in his hometown and embezzled firearms from the local defense force during his tenure as township head, so he was arrested. Later, according to the confession, another accomplice, Xie Hanchang, was arrested. According to his confession, he was 16 years old, from Haimen, and served as an orderly. He claimed that he knew nothing about this matter, but said that until yesterday morning, he learned that the regiment leader had been detained by his superiors for suspected theft, and the battalion commander was on the run. After recording the confession by Section Chief Yao of the Criminal Division, the above two suspects were sent to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation.

### Cishu Mansion: Man Jumps to Death

[Our Newspaper's Report] At 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, a man about 30 years old jumped off the Cishu Mansion on Jiujiang Road near Shandong Road. He fell onto the lead roof of the kitchen of the Fulu Raincoat Company on the ground floor. After falling to the ground, his brains burst and he died. Afterwards, the police station in charge sent personnel to the scene to transport the body to Renji Hospital and then to the autopsy room for examination. A Donglai Bank 10,000 yuan check and 2,845 yuan in cash were found on the deceased. He was wearing work clothes and a long shirt. Because he had no ID card, his surname is unknown. There were also two letters, one from an aunt to her nephew Xingsheng, and the other addressed to Brother Shenfu, with the ending signed as Xiaomei Aizhen. The identity of the deceased and the reasons for the suicide are being investigated by the police.

### Murder Case of Bodies Dumped During Dongmen County Government's Evacuation Solved: Prisoner Kills Escorting Personnel
Main Culprit Flees to Shanghai and is Arrested: Many Silver Dollars and Jewelry Found on Him

[Our Newspaper's Report] Last New Year's Eve, as institutions affiliated with the Haimen County Government were ordered to evacuate, a prisoner riot occurred at the detention center of the county's Judicial Office while escorting seven thieves, including Jiang Boqi and Chen Jixin, to Chongming by sea. As a result, the director of the detention center, Lu Yanxi, clerks Huang Nengyu and Ji Tingsen, and guards Gu Deqing and others were killed by the prisoners with weapons, bayonets, and shackles that they had seized. Their bodies were then thrown into the sea one by one, disposed of, and all public funds and items were stolen before fleeing without a trace. Gan, chief of the Criminal Investigation Section of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, recently obtained a clue that the main culprit in the case, Jiang Boqi, had fled to Shanghai under the alias Xiong Bingnan, wearing a uniform of the 19th Column, and usually hid in the home of his relative Zhou Bin at No. 771 Gonghe Xin Road in this city. After sending personnel to investigate, the culprit was arrested at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Wujin Road yesterday and taken to the bureau. Fifteen silver dollars, one anklet, one bracelet, two gold-plated chain watchbands, a pair of shirt buttons, a pair of ruby earrings, a lock piece and chain, a pair of emerald earrings, and one emerald Ruyi were found on him. The police bureau is investigating the source of these items.

### Italian Pilot Pickpocketed: Suspects Caught with Stolen Goods on the Same Day

[Our Newspaper's Report] Italian pilot Gatanana, residing at No. 37, Lane 159, Huashan Road, took the No. 9 public bus at the intersection of Huashan Road and Zhongzheng Middle Road at 8:50 AM on March 30th to work at the "Rech Hotel" on the Waibaidu Bridge. Unexpectedly, when the bus arrived at the intersection of Zhongzheng Middle Road and Tongfu Road, he discovered that a book of American New York Bank traveler's checks, totaling US$2,500, had disappeared. He immediately reported to the ticket seller to drive the bus into the jurisdiction of the Xincheng Police Sub-Bureau and requested a search. The police dispatched personnel to search the passengers, but nothing was found. Afterwards, Ding Zhenduo, the chief of the sub-bureau, immediately convened all the criminal police officers of the judicial section to investigate. At 2:00 PM, Inspector Wang Jichuan, Police Chief Huang Yulin, officers Zhang Baichuan, Shen Jinyao, and Wang Bingheng learned that the case was committed by pickpockets Zhang Shiren and Li Zhangqing, who lived at No. 161, Xinxin Lane, Taikang Road, Dapu Bridge. The officers went to the address and saw the two criminals, Zhang Shiren and Li Zhangqing, flipping through the American dollar checks in the front building. They were taken to the bureau for investigation, and the stolen goods were handed over to the victim.

### Resolving the Difficulty of Factory Payrolls: National Bank Issues Large Amounts of Cash

Hu Youliang, representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Ouyang Cen, representative of the Industrial Association, and Zhou Xuexiang, representative of the General Labor Union, visited Liu Gongyun, President of the National Bank, at 9:00 AM yesterday to request a solution to the cash problem required for workers' payrolls.

The remaining amount may be in the form of banker's drafts, but the representatives deeply felt the hardship of the workers' lives and hoped that the banker's drafts could be fully accepted in the market.

### Father Bai Deceived in Loan: Zhu Qixin and Others Accused

[Our Newspaper's Report] The case in which Zhu Qixin, grandson of the late Shanghai tycoon Zhu Baosan, was accused of fraud by Spanish priest Bai Langge was heard in the district court yesterday. Zhu, on January 17th of the 36th year of the Republic, presented four deeds and a new loan agreement owned by his father, Zhu Ziheng, and asked his father to guarantee it. Through the introduction of a Polish man, Pan Qiaonan, he borrowed US$12,000 from Bai, stating a monthly interest of 6.5%. He agreed to repay the full amount on March 17th of the same year. When the time came, Zhu refused to repay, and, in consultation with Pan, deposited 154,416,800 legal currency in the district court, only to state that Pan was the creditor. After receiving the court's deposit notification, Pan took it to Bai and claimed that the deposit was legally unfounded and could ask the court to revoke it and order the return of Bai's US dollars. Bai believed it to be true and handed over the mortgage contract and loan agreement to Pan to apply to the court. Unexpectedly, after Pan obtained the funds, he embezzled them. Bai waited for a long time without any response and became suspicious. Only after investigating did he realize that he had been deceived. Bai, believing that Zhu and Pan were clearly conspiring to defraud, filed a private prosecution.

### Robbery and Shooting on Route des Soeurs; Victim Calls for Help and Two Suspects Apprehended

[Report from our Newspaper] Last night at 9:30 PM, six robbers suddenly appeared at a certain address in Lane 1250 on Route des Soeurs in Western Shanghai. Two of them were armed and brazenly searched and robbed the premises. As they were leaving, one of the robbers fired a shot as a show of force, and they then fled in different directions. The victim, displaying courage, immediately gave chase, shouting for help along the way. The location was very close to the West Railway Station, and a police officer named Li Xiangyu, hearing the cries, quickly came out with his gun and apprehended one of the robbers on the spot, identified as Yuan Ruiqing. Another suspect, Ni Ruqing, was also taken into custody and handed over to the Xinjing Police Station for investigation.

### Grain Store Owner Detained for Fraudulent Practices in Rationed Rice Sales

[Report from our Newspaper] The Civil Food Distribution Office recently received reports that the Yuan Tai Xing Rice Store at 1749 Nanjing West Road in the Jing'an District had been engaging in fraudulent practices since it began selling rationed rice. These practices included short-weighing and mixing inferior rice with superior rice. Yesterday, the office dispatched officials, along with representatives from the China branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration and the Municipal Police Bureau, to conduct an on-site investigation. The investigation confirmed that the rice store had indeed used short-weighing, mixing, and substitution tactics to conceal over 100 shi (a unit of dry volume) of allocated American rice. Part of this rice had already been secretly sold to the Zhongyuan Telephone Equipment Factory at 1782 on the same road and the Weisheng Tofu Shop at 872 Route梵皇渡. With conclusive evidence, the store owner, Chen Pengfei, has been detained and, along with relevant documents, transferred to the court for interrogation.

### A Visit to the Ancient Tomb in Changzhou (Part Two)

— Jiang Dayi

Tomb Brick Decorations

Thanks to the kindness of Mr. Li Tianxing, the 常州 correspondent reported by the county, he accompanied us to the ancient foundations at Qinglong Bridge outside Nandou. However, due to continuous rainy weather, the pit of the foundations was completely filled with water, making it impossible to enter the tomb for a thorough investigation. Mr. Li only asked the local primary school principal to find a tomb brick for us. The decorations on this brick were different from the first one we saw. In addition to the decorations on one face, it also had decorations on the long and short sides. The side decorations were overlapping chevron patterns, while the face decorations consisted of a diamond pattern made of three overlapping lines, paired with large coins supported by diagonal lines as the base. The spaces between the diamond patterns and the large coins were filled with several cross patterns. The pattern on the brick's surface, like the first brick, was created by repeatedly imprinting a model, only about a quarter of the brick's surface area, four times onto the brick. Therefore, the four large coins on this brick were also identical. However, only the character "五" (five) was recognizable on the four characters on the coins, while the other three characters were unrecognizable. Even if we tried to interpret them forcefully, they would still be unintelligible.

The Mystery of the "Fake" Characters

Later, Mr. Li led us to the Zhengbao Newspaper Office, as they also had two tomb bricks from this ancient tomb. One of the tomb bricks had decorations similar to the second one we saw. The other was largely the same as the first one we saw, with the same pattern of banana leaf veins paired with four large coins on the brick's surface. This pattern was also made by repeatedly imprinting a model four times. The only difference was that the banana leaf veins had "main veins," the coins were relatively smaller, with a diameter of only about four centimeters, and only the left and right characters "五" (five) were recognizable on the coins, while the top and bottom characters were also indistinguishable.

Why were the characters above the "五" (five) character unrecognizable on the coins of the two tomb bricks we saw in Changzhou? I think it might be that the brick-making craftsmen did not have much literacy. They randomly drew several seemingly authentic "fake characters" on top of the relatively simple "五" (five) character and considered it done. This is similar to the craftsmen who made porcelain, where the characters in the stamps drawn on the bottom of porcelain bowls were often completely fake and nonsensical. Unfortunately, we were never able to see the model for the tomb brick we saw in Shanghai this time, so we could not confirm whether the coin pattern on the tomb brick we saw in Shanghai was the blurry "大泉五百" (Da Quan Wu Bai - a type of ancient coin) or the blurry "fake characters." However, even if the coin pattern on the tomb brick we saw in Shanghai was not "大泉五百" (Da Quan Wu Bai), we could only say that the age of the ancient foundations may not necessarily be after the fifth year of the Jiahe era of Emperor Wu of the Three Kingdoms. As for the tomb dating back to a period around the Three Kingdoms, that is still correct. The three tomb bricks we saw in Shanghai and Changzhou can still prove the accuracy of this statement.

How to Excavate

Although we could not go inside the ancient foundations for detailed observation, from the exposed parts, the scale was not very large. It was neither the mausoleum of an emperor nor necessarily the tomb of a prominent official or nobleman. The division of the tomb into classrooms is also the usual structure of Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties tombs. Moreover, in our opinion, most of these ancient tombs have been damaged. Undamaged ordinary Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties tombs rarely have economically valuable funerary objects. Damaged ones, of course, even less so. Therefore, if we excavate this ancient tomb with the goal of finding treasures, we will definitely lose our labor and be greatly disappointed. However, to know the life of the deceased buried in the tombs, is a reflection of the living conditions of the people outside the tombs at that time. Therefore, if we want to pursue the state of life of the living at that time and clean up these tomb foundations and examine the life of the deceased in the tomb, that is a very valuable undertaking. However, to do such work, on the one hand, the supervisors must handle the various discovered relics very carefully and fully record the various discovered remains with photographs, drawings, and texts. On the other hand, the workers must also be very careful, otherwise, there is a risk of destroying good materials. Therefore, this is definitely not a problem that can be solved by mobilizing laborers to dig or asking the army to help dig. In this time of war and chaos, it is truly not easy to do the cleanup work of this ancient tomb with minimal regret. Fortunately, Changzhou is a place with a very high level of academic culture. I think the gentlemen who are concerned about academic culture in the local area will definitely be able to come up with a good way to handle this matter properly.

### The Anhui Southern Highway Undergoing Difficult Management

— Our Correspondent Dong Min

[Report from our Newspaper Tunxi, 26th] The main and branch lines of the Anhui Southern Highway after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War have not yet been "restored." The construction funding budget has consistently failed to meet actual needs. For the past four years, it has been a struggle to keep them open. In recent months, the war situation in Anhui Province has reversed the situation. Only the Jiangnan section of the road remains barely passable. According to Ni Chun, Director of the Anhui Southern Office of the Anhui Provincial Highway Bureau, the current situation is as follows:

(1) The section from D渡口 (opposite Anqing) through Dongliu County to Zhizhi County has not been open to traffic since the spring of last year. The planned route to Zhizhi and Shimenjie has not yet been built. The current condition of the section from Shimenjie to Fuliang (Jiangxi Province) is unknown.

(2) The section from Dongliu to Madangzhan, only 60 kilometers of which is within this province, has not been open to traffic for a long time. The remaining section is within Jiangxi Province.

(3) The two lines, Wuhu-Tunxi and Tunxi-Jingdezhen (i.e., Fuliang), were changed to the Jinggan National Highway by order of the Ministry of Communications in August 1947 and are under the jurisdiction of the First District Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. They are currently open to traffic.

(4) The Fanchang-Tongling-Qingyang section is currently being repaired and will be open to traffic soon.

(5) The Qingyang-Yansi section, 165 kilometers long, currently has buses running.

(6) The Tunxi-Jiekou section currently has buses running.

(7) The Tunxi-Yulingguan section belongs to the Hanghui National Highway and has been open to traffic for the longest time.

(8) The Jingwu Line belongs to the Jinggan National Highway and is still open to traffic.

(9) The Xuancheng-泾县 section, a 50-kilometer branch line, has not yet been built.

(10) The Xuan Guangde Line has not been open to traffic for a long time, and the situation is unknown.

(11) The Xuan Nanling Line has not been restored since it was damaged during the Anti-Japanese War.

The Hangzhou-Tunxi highway passenger and freight transportation has mainly been carried out by the Hangzhou Automobile Company. In recent years, traffic on this road has been frequent. In order to develop its business, the First Transportation Office has been providing freight services since March 22, facilitating merchants.

The Tunxi-Wuyuan highway has a large amount of earth and stone work. Wuyuan has suffered from disasters for a long time, and the rural areas are devastated. There have been many requests to postpone the start of construction. The Huo (County)-Yu (亭) Highway, only 14 kilometers long, has also been shelved due to the local inability to raise funds for construction. The Jingde-Jixi, Jixi-Fanchang, and Fanchang-泾县 sections were planned to start construction, but they have now been suspended. The lack of funding is a major reason.

People who have been in public service for too long know that the signs of being an official are "Wang Xiaoer celebrating the New Year" (meaning it never happens), so they simply resign and run solo, going to small counties not far from nearby Guiyang to buy pig oil, pork, rice, and American tobacco, and then sell them in Guiyang for a three- or fourfold profit. Otherwise, even if they stay in Guiyang, they specialize in being "shuttle traders" for others, buying and selling on behalf of customers and taking commissions, although it may inevitably lose "face," it is still more profitable than being a public employee. Those who have special influence as a background, embezzle public funds, seize public land, and use their power to engage in private real estate transactions, building the most luxurious dance halls, tea houses, cinemas, and theaters, have recently increased particularly in Guiyang. These people "ride high on the clouds" and are making a fortune everywhere they go.

Private enterprises have long been using other currency systems to replace the gold yuan coupons for the treatment of their employees. The yarn merchants on Guangdong Street pay 30 silver dollars a month to street vendors, 50 silver dollars to directors, and 80 to 100 silver dollars to assistant managers. Except for the Central News Agency, the Central Daily News, and the Guizhou Daily, which are still supporting the gold yuan coupons, the seven or eight privately run daily and evening newspapers are paying their employees a certain number of monthly newspaper subscriptions converted into gold yuan coupons. Some get six or seven subscriptions, others get fifteen or sixteen. At the current price of 3,000 yuan per monthly newspaper subscription, they can earn at least 20,000 yuan and up to 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, and their salaries are adjusted according to the newspaper price without any deductions. Private primary and secondary schools, such as Chengwan Middle School run by the Catholic Church, pay each full-time teacher three qian (a unit of weight) of gold per month, and Zhidao Primary School pays five silver dollars. These methods were not conceived or implemented during the Anti-Japanese War, but now they are considered the fairest and most reasonable. I wonder what the people in charge of our country's finance and banking think when they see this.

A case involving a certain military organization stationed in Guiyang and a female reporter from a certain evening newspaper in Guiyang recently occurred, involving kidnapping and extortion. The details are bizarre and complex, involving a large number of people. The case is slowly unfolding. Initially, the relevant personnel of a certain military organization and their subordinates were engaged in business. Later, the subordinates invited outsiders to participate. Because of uneven distribution of profits, the subordinates of the military organization kidnapped one of the outside participants and hid them in a warehouse not far from Guiyang, demanding a ransom. Then, Chen Jiaqi, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, came forward to mediate, and the family of the outside participant paid gold and silver dollars according to the conditions and was released. Unexpectedly, the matter was leaked to a female reporter from a certain evening newspaper. The female reporter went to visit the superior of the military organization and insisted on interviewing about the news. After much discussion, according to people familiar with the inside story and who have evidence, the result was that ten taels of gold were exchanged for a "gentleman's agreement" not to publish the news. However, a paper cannot wrap fire, and the news slowly spread among the people in the news industry and was fully published by a reporter from the Central Daily News to clear his own reputation. Director Chen of the Municipal Health Bureau has asked for leave and left Guiyang. Newspaper editors are conducting a thorough investigation, and the situation is worsening step by step.

### The Harsh Collection Conditions of Public Utilities Cause Great Suffering to the General Public

Hoping the Municipal Authorities Will Reconsider Improvements to Benefit the Masses

Editor: My family's water is supplied by the British-owned Water Company. This month's bill was received on the morning of the 23rd, and the payment deadline was the 25th of this month. Because the water bill is shared by several households, it takes time to collect the money. It was not collected until the 24th. On the afternoon of the 25th, I went to pay, but because there is a shortage of cash these days and the amount is large, most of the payments from each household were checks. The company's collector said that they would not accept checks, so I returned empty-handed. I went again on the morning of the 26th, but unexpectedly, they said that the bill was overdue and needed to be recalculated on the third floor before it could be paid. After calculation, the increase was as high as 70%. It was said that it was calculated according to the 2279 times index (the original price was calculated according to the 1339.36 times index). Because I did not have such a large amount of extra money on hand, I was unable to pay again, wasting my time and being fined a huge amount, which made me extremely angry. When the company collects payments, it often unreasonably obstructs checks and refuses to accept checks, which has no legal basis. Moreover, there was no prior notice of the late payment penalty (the company's bill only stated "If the full amount is not paid by the due date, the water supply will be suspended" and did not state that if the payment is overdue, it must be paid according to the new index). Now, the company has not obtained the approval of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and the Municipal Council, so how can it arbitrarily increase the burden on citizens by using the suspension of water supply as a weapon? It is also heard that the telephone company has a similar situation. I hope to publish these facts in the newspaper, and I hope that the Municipal Council and the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau will pay attention to them and quickly stop this abuse of power that exploits citizens. Reader Tang Sheng.

[Report from our Newspaper] In view of the recent widespread issuance of cashier's checks by commercial banks and financial institutions, which has inflated credit, and the fact that some banks and financial institutions have even issued fixed-amount cashier's checks without authorization, which is inconsistent with banking regulations, the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau recently notified the Silver Money Trust Industry Association to inform all banks and financial institutions that, with the exception of the Central Bank, no other national banks, bureaus, or commercial banks and financial institutions may issue fixed-amount cashier's checks. The following points should be noted when issuing cashier's checks: (1) They must be issued at the request of the customer. (2) Sufficient reserves must be deposited in the Central Bank.

### The Central Bank Throws Out Gold at Closing: The Gold Market's Rising Trend Slightly Subsides

[Report from our Newspaper] The gold market trend was firm yesterday. Because prices in other cities were rising and the Hong Kong exchange rate was shrinking, people were optimistic. The opening market trend was still flat, calling 871,000, with slight gains, and slightly fell to 869,000. In the middle of the day, with the strengthening of absorption by the Qingdao Gang and the Shanxi Gang, it rose all the way to 880,000, the upper limit, and closed at 879,000 at noon.

In the afternoon, with the issuance of 50,000 and 100,000 large bills and rumors of currency reform, positive news spread frequently. The banking gang, securities gang, and gold shop gang all turned bullish, and buying was soaring. The opening was at 882,000 and gradually rose to 924,000. At the last moment of closing, the Central Bank, at a price of 8,950,000 yuan, entrusted the Dadecheng Gold Shop to throw out 141 large bars, squeezing in capital of over 1.26 billion, and people's hearts turned calm, closing down to 895,000. Compared with the previous day, it jumped up 95,000, with interest as high as 1.6 yuan. The interbank clearing price was 874,500 in the morning and rose to 900,000 in the afternoon.

Off-Exchange

[Report from our Newspaper] Off-exchange buying was booming. The morning opened at 870,000, 875,000, fell to 863,000, 868,000, and rose to 888,000, 891,000. The noon close was at 878,000, 881,000. In the afternoon, with the competition of absorption by various gangs, the opening was at 880,000, 885,000, and rose all the way to 930,000, 935,000. The close was slightly lower at 922,000, 927,000. It also rebounded by 48,000. Next-day trading added interest of 70,000 per tael, rising to 992,000, 997,000.

[Report from our Newspaper] Gold jewelry was stable yesterday morning, still listed at 840,000, 920,000. In the afternoon, due to the surge in gold prices, it rose to 930,000, 1,000,200, and the entry and exit prices increased by another 10,000, with a difference of 90,000. Compared with the previous day, it increased by another 90,000. Silver jewelry also rose by 2,000, rising to 10,500, 12,000. Money changers listed at 870,000, 900,000 in the morning and rose to 900,000, 930,000 in the afternoon.

U.S. Dollars

[Report from our Newspaper] The off-exchange U.S. dollar market followed the trend. The morning opened at 17,500, 18,000, fell to 17,300, 17,800. The banking gang's import and export search was quite strong, rising all the way to 18,300, 18,800. The noon close was at 18,000, 18,500. In the afternoon, it went even higher, opening at 18,000, 18,500, and gradually rose to 19,300, 19,800. Money changers slightly released some, slightly retreating to 19,000, closing at 19,500. Compared with the previous day, it increased by 1,600. Next-day interest added 1,450, rising to 20,450, 20,950.

Silver Dollars

[Report from our Newspaper] Silver dollars on the street are increasingly sought after. Because industrial and commercial enterprises are paying salaries, retail investors are enthusiastically buying them. Moreover, various gangs are still exchanging a lot of money. (1) Local exporters have a large amount of money to exchange, about 1 million from Chongqing and Hankou. (2) In South China, traders in Guangzhou, Shantou, and other places have exchanged about 450,000. Because gold prices in South China are lower and silver dollar prices are still firm, gangs are exchanging large amounts of money using silver dollars. The exchange rate is only 8 yuan per 100 yuan, which is more cost-effective than exchanging gold yuan coupons at 60%. People are firm and holders are reluctant to sell. In the morning, silver dollars rose from 13,000, 14,000 all the way to 15,000, 16,000. In the afternoon, the market was once chaotic, with demand exceeding supply, reaching as high as 15,500, 16,500. In the evening, the market softened slightly. Silver dollars were called at 15,000, 16,000, small-head silver dollars were called at 12,500, 13,500. Eagle Dragon dollars were called at 9,500, 10,500. Check transactions were booming. Money changers were knocking that day with silver dollars initially at 16,000, 17,000, once reaching as high as 18,000, 19,000, and finally 17,000, 18,000, jumping about 20% higher than the previous day.

### White Rice Prices Hit 100,000 Mark, Flour Prices Surge and Quickly Retreat, Cooking Oil Prices Hover at Peak

Rice prices surged yesterday, with the rise lagging behind other commodities in recent days, so sellers were aggressively pushing prices higher. At the South Market, prices initially rose by 2,000 to 3,000, but later, due to scarce supplies, prices rose again, with white glutinous rice and early indica rice both increasing by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Special glutinous rice was priced at 95,000 yuan. At the North Market, white glutinous rice was at 93,000 yuan, and early indica rice also rose by 7,000 yuan. Retail prices for special glutinous rice have hit the 100,000 mark. Total arrivals at both markets were 6,278 piculs.

Cooking Oil

Prices, constrained by tight credit, were unable to rise further and hovered at their peak. Prices initially rose by 20,000 to 30,000, but then declined due to increased supplies. Soybean oil closed at 525,000, and rapeseed oil at 470,000, each rising slightly by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Small-batch sesame oil and tea oil remained firm, while soybean cakes were at their original prices.

Flour Market

Surged and quickly retreated, but still remained firm overall. At the start of trading, buyers aggressively purchased flour, creating abnormal chaos and driving prices sharply higher. Old-brand flour reached 37,000 yuan in the central market, with bids reaching 37,500 yuan. Military-brand flour was once bid as high as 36,000 yuan. Later, with gold prices falling slightly, sellers took profits at the high prices, and the market quickly reversed, with old-brand flour trading at 36,800 yuan and military-brand flour closing at 35,400 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

Experienced minimal fluctuations, and the market entered a period of consolidation. Soybeans and shelled peanuts remained stable. Mung beans saw increased demand from the Shantou traders, rising by 5,000 yuan. Sesame supply exceeded demand, falling by over 10,000 yuan. Red sorghum showed a slight gain, while corn was initially firm but later weakened.

Central Bank Notes Still Discounted – Need to Rewrite Monetary Finance

Banks Unable to Balance Accounts – Harming Themselves

Yesterday afternoon, silver dollars started to jump wildly again. There will be more excitement in the coming days.

Thank you, Central Bank, for amusing yourselves by recklessly issuing banknotes, claiming to alleviate the cash shortage, but actually increasing the amount of notes in circulation, exacerbating the need for cash, and stimulating the increase in discounts.

Central Bank notes have a prestigious name and are printed more beautifully than those of commercial banks, but in the market, they are discounted at 85% of face value, just like the notes of small and medium-sized banks.

Why does the Central Bank debase the reputation of the national bank in this way?

Strange things happen in chaotic times, and the Central Bank does particularly strange things. I heard that it is very easy for foreign banks to withdraw cash, and that a lot of cash is flowing from the hands of compradors of foreign banks to the discount market.

I also heard that commercial banks have been withdrawing and depositing 1 to 2 million yuan in cash from the Central Bank every day for a long time. This cash is also being transferred to the discount market.

The Central Bank's cash has many uses! But ordinary people and employees have no share in it.

Life is difficult for everyone. Military, police, civil servants, and teachers are particularly miserable. Paying salaries in silver dollars is a promise that can never be fulfilled. Giving them some cash to earn some discounts would make them happy.

However, small civil servants and soldiers never receive cash because these cash funds, intended for national use, are moved around in large bundles for special purposes.

Given all this, the elimination of cash discounts is hopeless.

With financial management like this, all of finance and monetary banking will have to be rewritten by contemporary figures.

While the situation is in a state of waiting, the market is in a state of flux.

However, yesterday afternoon, news that many banks were unable to balance their accounts spread throughout the city, and the situation had not improved by last night. There were also rumors of several clients defaulting. People cannot help but frown.

What is the reason that banks cannot stay stable at this time?

People say that with interest rates so high, banks should be doing well. But in fact, interest income is no longer the banks' way of survival in recent years.

Currently, banks are living in a great contradiction. For banks with large balances, high interest rates mean good profits. For small and medium-sized banks with tight balances, high interest rates mean a heavy burden.

Because most banks are creditors on one hand, welcoming high interest rates, and debtors on the other hand, fearing high interest rates. It is also a common phenomenon for banks to operate like trading companies or enterprises. In normal times, they are more comfortable than trading companies or enterprises because it is easy to move funds and delay the delivery of goods. But when credit tightens, they are not as comfortable as enterprises. Because they have to deal with their own debts and their clients' payments. It is really hard to bear two burdens at once.

Many things are like shooting oneself in the foot. For example, the recent instability of banks is due to the fact that ordinary customers are unwilling to deposit funds because they cannot get cash.

In the past, when industrial and commercial sectors received funds, whether cash or checks, everyone deposited them in the bank, preferring to pay with their own checks.

Since cash has become scarce, banks have been holding onto cash and only paying with banknotes. Even those who deposit cash only receive banknotes. This practice has forced customers to lose money on banknote discounts, making them unwilling to deposit funds.

Furthermore, all transactions now involve the exchange of notes. All the notes received, large and small, used to be deposited in the bank and a check was issued to make up the price of the goods and pay the other party. Everyone is receiving and paying in this way, so there is no need to deposit in the bank.

Most customers no longer need or find it convenient to deposit in the bank for transactions. As a result, the amount of funds received by most banks has decreased significantly, or has not increased, or the increase is not equal to the multiple increases in commodity prices. This can be seen from the daily statistics of check clearing. Therefore, the situation of banks is even more difficult.

### Large Denomination Notes to be Issued Today – Credit Possibly to Tighten

[Report from our newspaper] Credit was tight yesterday. The overnight loan rate opened at 80 yuan per thousand, rising to 100 yuan per thousand around 11:00 AM. In the afternoon, it eased back to around 80 yuan, but around 3:00 PM, due to strong demand from various industries, the overnight loan rate rose to 100 yuan. Later, due to the outflow of treasury funds, it eased back to around 70 yuan. Yesterday, domestic banks had a net outflow of 1.5 billion, while foreign banks had a net inflow of 800 million. The large clearing house had an inflow of 1.6 billion, and the small clearing house had an outflow of 900 million. Today, the national bank will issue large denomination notes of 5,000 and 10,000 yuan, which are expected to be sold to prevent possible price increases, and credit will likely tighten.

### Trade Commission Holds Regular Meeting on Discount and Loans – Approves Three Loan Applications

[Report from our newspaper] The Trade Advisory Committee of the Central Bank Discount and Loan Committee held its 12th regular meeting at 11:00 AM yesterday, chaired by Chen Changtong, and approved three loan applications. Furthermore, the Discount and Loan Committee is establishing a review subcommittee for loans for ordering production projects, focusing on basic industries, mining, daily necessities, and export materials. It is expected to be established within days. It is also learned that after the committee began accepting applications for ordering loans, many manufacturers have been visiting the committee to obtain blank application forms.

### Tea Market Transactions Scarce, Prices Firm

Yesterday in the tea market, although buying interest was not strong, sellers were unwilling to sell at lower prices. Unfounded rumors spread like mushrooms after rain, leading to continued scarce transactions and firm prices. Fortunately, in the afternoon, credit in the industry shifted from loose to tight, and the price increases eased slightly.

It is learned that after the retail prices of tea were adjusted on the 16th of this month, due to the lack of tea in stock and the sharp rise in tea prices in line with general commodities, the prices were no longer in line with costs. Therefore, starting today, changes will be made, increasing prices by one level. For example, the highest price for Longjing green tea was originally 32,000 yuan per catty, but is now 48,000 yuan; the lowest price was originally 1,600 yuan per catty, but is now 2,400 yuan. All other prices will be adjusted accordingly.

### Domestic Stocks Firm, Then Soar

[Report from our newspaper] Domestic stock market closed firmer yesterday after a period of consolidation. At the opening, prices were pressured by outflows of remittances to other areas and by tight credit in the market on the last day of the three-day settlement period. The publication of the cost of living index and the fact that factories were raising funds to pay salaries led to selling pressure, preventing prices from rising. Later, as prices of goods outside the market rose sharply, especially gold, and some commercial banks remitted funds out, easing the cash situation, buying interest returned to the market and prices rose rapidly. Yung Shing Cotton Mill opened at 9.85 yuan, and both domestic and foreign bulls covered their short positions, pushing prices down to 9.65 yuan. New short positions were covered, and prices rose again to 10.035 yuan and 10.04 yuan. Afterwards, yarn sellers entered the market, and banks frequently took profits, causing the market to consolidate. Near noon, credit eased slightly and gold prices were firm, leading to aggressive buying and pushing prices up to 10.05 yuan at the noon close.

Small and medium-sized open-market stocks opened flat and closed higher at noon. Hsin Ho opened at 2.80 yuan, reached a high of 3.10 yuan, and closed at 3.00 yuan at noon. Hsin Kuang opened and reached a high of 1.13 yuan and closed at that high at noon. Ching Fu traded around 0.45 yuan and closed at 0.445 yuan at noon. Chin Hsing opened at 0.50 yuan, reached a high of 0.61 yuan, and closed at 0.605 yuan at noon. Mei Ya opened at 3.05 yuan and rose to 3.28 yuan before falling back slightly at the noon close. Other stocks also saw sharp increases.

In the afternoon, due to tight credit in the morning, buying interest was suppressed, and the increased cost of living index raised confidence. Yung Shing Cotton Mill initially reached a high of 11.70 yuan, hitting the limit up. Later, rumors of gold sales caused bulls to become fearful, and prices fell to 11.10 yuan. Finally, yarn sellers and Guangdong yarn merchants resumed buying, boosting the market again and hitting the limit up. Off-exchange trading opened at 11.00 yuan, fell to 10.07 yuan, and finally rebounded to close at 11.05 yuan. Total turnover for the day was 5,457,100,000 shares.

Foreign stocks stopped falling and rose yesterday due to strong foreign exchange and stock market conditions and firm gold prices. All stocks soared. Ewo Cotton Mill traded at 27,000 yuan, 28,000 yuan, and then rose to 30,000 yuan. Union Insurance traded at 32,000 yuan, 35,000 yuan, and rose 1,000 yuan. Jardine Matheson traded at 9,000 yuan, 9,500 yuan, also rising 1,000 yuan. Wheelock Marden reached 100,000 yuan, 100,500 yuan, rising rapidly by 15,000 yuan. Asia Navigation traded at 2,800 yuan, 2,900 yuan. Other stocks also saw significant gains.

Gold bonds initially bid at 580,000 yuan and rose all the way to 650,000 yuan, closing at 590,000 yuan at noon. There were no trades in the afternoon.

### Exchanging Flour for Coal

Kailan Mining Administration in Negotiations

[Report from our newspaper] According to sources, the Kailan Mining Administration plans to supply coal to Shanghai by shipping 300,000 bags of flour to North China in exchange for 100,000 metric tons of bituminous coal. The terms are three bags of flour for one metric ton of coal, with both flour and coal to be delivered in Qinhuangdao, North China. All round-trip shipping, transportation insurance, and partial hull insurance, as well as other expenses, will be borne by the supplier of the flour. The coal obtained will be sold to public enterprises at cost without profit. It is learned that North China levies import and export taxes, with coal subject to an export tax of 30% and flour subject to an import tax of 15%. The Mining Administration is currently negotiating with relevant parties, and once resolved, the flour-for-coal contract will be finalized.

[Report from our newspaper] The prices of various types of coal from the Four Mines Joint Venture were adjusted yesterday as follows: Keelung coal at 184,100 yuan per ton, foreign bituminous coal at 508,320 yuan, and Kailan coal at 225,680 yuan.

### Cotton Yarn Market to Rise, Cloth Market Stable

The cotton yarn market was flat at first and then strong yesterday. In the morning, the market was very quiet due to tight credit, and there was a strong desire to sell. Later, the release of the cost of living index stimulated sentiment, and prices rose sharply at noon. 21-count Double Horse Rainbow opened at 3.16 million, and after opening, absorption was not strong, and the market was hovering. Later, because of the rising gold market and the increase in the cost of living index, buyers began to take positions, and the market immediately rose, rising to 3.25 million at noon, up 300,000. 20-count Golden City was at 3.09 million, also up 200,000. 16-count was up 120,000, and 10-count was up slightly by 50,000 yuan.

42-count Blue Phoenix initially traded at 6.35 million and also saw consolidation after opening. However, because coarse yarn was firm and replicate industries continued to absorb, bids were raised and then rose again, closing at 6.40 million at noon, up 400,000. 40-count was up 550,000, and 30-count was up 200,000.

The cotton cloth market softened slightly due to extremely tight credit in the industry, but the industry's sentiment was very good. Everyone was optimistic, and the potential trend was still solid and trending upwards. Buyers and sellers were not moving much. Supply and demand were corresponding, so the trend was mostly opened flat. After seeing slightly higher bids, there was another decline, and the market rebounded again when gold prices rebounded.

Dragon fine cloth opened at 132,000 yuan and first saw a high price of 135,000 yuan. The Textile Construction Company sold various kinds of cotton cloth, including Dragon Head B fine cloth and large Dragon Head fine cloth. People's minds turned empty, and interest was secretly bid at 90 yuan, and there were many who sold out. Prices fell to 126,000 yuan and closed at 131,000 yuan at noon, down 1,500 yuan from the previous day. Dragon Head B fine cloth fell slightly by 2,000 yuan to trade at 116,000 yuan. Large Double Dragon and Flower and Bird fine cloth traded at 107,000 yuan. Four Gentlemen serge opened at 109,000 yuan in the morning, reached a high of 118,000 yuan, then fell to 107,000 yuan, and closed at 114,500 yuan at noon, down 2,000 yuan. Colored cloth saw a slight increase.

China Textile Sells Yarn

### Ren Yu Scores New High, Hai Qing is Weak

[Report from our newspaper] The Ren Yu basketball team defeated the Hai Qing team 72-34 last night, setting a new record for the highest score in the four-team basketball league. Their second-place position was also determined at the end of the game.

Ren Yu's performance last night was not ideal. Because they still need to play against Shanghai Police this Saturday and in order to conserve their strength, the main players did not dare to go all out. Also, they were intentionally trying to surpass the record of 69 points they scored against Hai Qing in the first week. They focused on offense and not defense. Therefore, the Charlton navy officers, whose strength is only at the Class B level, were able to score 34 points. The entire game was not exciting. Ren Yu's signature smokescreen offense was not effective because Hai Qing played a zonal defense that was neither fish nor fowl and easily broken. Wu Xinyun and Yao Wenyi did not shoot well, but the score still reached 72. This shows how weak Hai Qing is.

Sun Guozheng of Ren Yu was sick, and Cai Jindian and Zhuang Yirong were absent. Wu Xinyun, Xu Zhongyi, Yao Wenyi, Shen Pengju, and Li Zhaohe started the game. Hai Qing took the lead with a free throw. Ren Yu's Xiao Wu scored with a hook shot. Wenyi threw the ball in from the corner. Zhongyi and Pengju successively scored with one hand. In an instant, they took a 12-2 lead. Hai Qing was unable to keep up and made frequent mistakes. All the rebounds were taken by Li Zhaohe. At 33-13, Ren Yu substituted Chen Weiyuan and Yan Bin to give the main players a chance to rest. The first half ended with a large lead of 38-15.

At the start of the second half, Ren Yu went all out, and their offensive was unstoppable. After taking a 35-point lead, [Old Man] Weiyuan came on again and scored four points for Ren Yu with two medium-distance shots. Hai Qing took advantage of Ren Yu's relaxed defense and counterattacked with all their might, scoring a lot of points, but Yao Wenyi and Wang Huaiting kept scoring in return, maintaining a 38-point lead. In the end, they stepped up the offense to score, and the game ended with Ren Yu winning 72-34. The results are as follows:

Fat Team Loses to Ping Ping

The Class B-C Fat team played Ping Ping with a small crowd watching. The Fat team took the offensive at the start, with Sun Mingxin scoring two baskets in a row. Ping Ping's Xia Zhiao, Wang Weijun, Li Yongji, and others were not to be outdone, and quickly overwhelmed the Fat team 12-6. Dong Yangfeng's long-distance runs showed that the enemy's momentum was difficult to stop. At halftime, Ping Ping led 27-24.

In the second half, both sides made many substitutions, and the situation was very close, with the difference often only two or three baskets. Ping Ping's Xia and Li and the Fat team's Zhang Shaoqing scored a lot of points. In the end, Ping Ping won 52-47.

### Annamite Tennis Champions to Perform in Hong Kong – Van Sau Has Defeated Four French Davis Cup Players

[Hong Kong Air Mail] Annamite tennis stars VAN SAU and DUONG, scheduled to perform in Hong Kong on April 2, 4, and 5, arrived in Hong Kong at 2:00 PM on the 30th via French Airways with Annamite Paris Tennis Club representative Wan En. Wan Feng is the team leader for this trip. The sixth-ranked French player, Du Bei, will arrive on April 3. The three are staying at the Hong Kong Hotel. According to their team leader, "Van Sau and Ong both participated in the recent French Open, with good results. If the Hong Kong champion can defeat Van Sau, he will be a rare talent."

According to the team leader, Van Sau has defeated French Davis Cup representatives such as Pousas, Brally, Maddi Dupay Lisa, etc. His results are as follows: defeated Brally 6-3, 8-6; defeated Madibo 6-3, 3-6, 6-2; defeated Palasa 2-6, 8-6, 6-1; defeated Pousas 2-6, 5-7, 7-5, 6-4, 6-2. In 1945, Van Sau once defeated Du Bei, the current French No. 6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-0. Van Sau reached the semi-finals of the French Open this time before losing to French No. 1 Pannat 6-4, 6-2, 7-5. As for Ong, he is the Tokyo champion and Saigon runner-up. In 1947-48, he participated in three competitions in France and managed to win one set against the fifth-ranked French player Ada Salim before losing 6-4, 5-7, 6-2. He is calm during games and easy to get along with.

The two are scheduled to perform at the Chinese Recreation Club in Causeway Bay starting at 3:00 PM on the 2nd. Ong will first play a best-of-three singles match against Cai Huiquan, our Davis Cup representative who recently returned from Singapore. Then, Hong Kong champion Ye Guanxiong will play a best-of-five singles match against Van Sau. Given Ye Guanxiong's performance this year, we all have high hopes for him. To have such a person come to compete is a touchstone for him. We hope that Guanxiong can work hard and make a splash.

The competition schedule is as follows: In addition to the two singles matches at the Chinese Recreation Club as mentioned above, the remaining matches will be held at the Hong Kong Cricket Club grounds next Monday and Tuesday. On the 4th, starting at 4:15 PM, Xu Weipei will first play a best-of-three singles match against Van Sau, followed by Ye Guanxiong playing a best-of-five singles match against Du Bei. On the 5th, starting at 4:15 PM, Ong will first play a best-of-three singles match against a Hong Kong player, followed by the Hong Kong doubles champions—which will be either the Xu-Xu team or the Ye-Li team—playing against Du Bei and Van Sau. As for the Hong Kong player who will play singles against Ong, it is said that if the Hong Kong champions are Ye and Li, then Ong's opponent will be Xu Runpei.

### Ping Pong Knowledge

— Written by Wang Xin-jing, Edited by Chen Lin-sheng (3)

Practice Section

Thinking in your heart and speaking with your mouth is not as good as actually doing it. There are many ways to play ping pong, and many ways to learn these methods: some require using your eyes to see, some require using your ears to hear, and some require using your brain to think. But all these methods you see, hear, and think of must be realized through practice.

How should you block a certain ball? How should you attack a certain ball? How should you hit a chopped ball? ... Understanding in your heart is useless; you must actually try it to make it useful.

In fact, mastering a certain hitting technique is not something that can be learned in one or two tries. Even if you learn it, you must become proficient in it to be useful. To become proficient, you must practice, you must practice a lot. The more you practice, the more freely you can apply it and the more deeply you can understand it. Therefore, to have interest in the sport and to improve your skills, you must practice a lot.

1. Practice and Equipment

Ping pong equipment is the simplest and easiest among ball sports. Speaking casually, you can have fun anywhere with a few wooden boards or two tables. But this is just for casual playing. If you have the means, it is best to have equipment based on standards for formal practice. This will be very advantageous in future competitions.

Arrangement of the Ping Pong Room Now let's first talk about a standard ping pong room: The volume of a standard ping pong room must have 10 feet of open space at each end of the table and 6 feet of open space on each side. There should be at least 9 feet of space from the table surface to the ceiling. Including the ping pong table, the ping pong room should be at least:

Length: 29 feet;

Width: 17 feet 8 inches to 18 feet;

Height: 11 feet 6 inches or more.

In the middle of both sides of the ping pong table, 3 feet away from the table, place the seats for the referees and the recording table.

If you want to prepare for accommodating spectators, then the length and width must be expanded accordingly. And it is best to have seats arranged around the perimeter, and the height of the seats should be higher in the back rows to avoid the people in the front rows blocking the view of the people in the back rows.

The floor must be covered with thick flooring and must be kept clean.

The surrounding walls are best in white color.

The light in the ping pong room must shine in from both sides. For example, if the table is placed north-south, then the east and west sides must have more windows to allow sufficient light to enter. If the table is placed east-west, the light must enter fully from the south and north sides.

Many ping pong practices are in the evening. The source of light relies entirely on electric lights. The electric lights must be suspended in the center of both ends of the ping pong table. It must be slightly higher than the table to avoid hindering the hitting of the ball. It is best to add a white porcelain shade to the outside of the light bulb to allow the light to radiate evenly in all directions.

Few people often pay attention to the layer of light. This matter seems to have little relationship at first glance, but in practice, there are disadvantages of backlighting or dazzling, reducing interest and affecting the progress of skills at the same time. In competitions, it will cause incorrect results. So this should be noted.

Standard Ping Pong Table The non-standard ping pong room makes it impossible to fully develop the ability to hit the ball, and the impact of the standard of the ping pong table is even greater. A ping pong table that is standard for daily practice can be as easy to use as in practice during competitions. If the ping pong table used for daily practice is casually put together, then it will inevitably be difficult to grasp during competitions, giving the opponent a chance to take advantage of, and putting oneself under great pressure.

According to the world's current ping pong rules, the standard ping pong table should be placed horizontally and must meet the following requirements: (A) Length: 2.743 meters (ie 9 feet); (B) Width: 1.524 meters (ie 5 feet); (C) Height: 0.762 meters (ie from the ground to the table surface is 2 feet 6 inches); (D) The table surface must be smooth, and there is no limit to what kind of material it is made of, but it must be able to make the ping pong ball dropped from 0.5 cm (1 foot) above the table surface bounce to 20.3 cm (8 inches) to 22.9 cm (9 inches) high. (E) The entire table surface and table legs should be painted in a non-reflective dark green color. (F) A white border line of 1.9 cm (three-quarters of an inch) wide should be painted around the edge of the table surface. (G) The installation of the table legs should be at least 20 cm (4 inches) away from the table end and table side.

The ping pong net is stretched parallel to the center of the straight side line on both sides of the ping pong table and the horizontal lines at both ends. This net must have the following conditions: (A) Net height 15.2 cm (6 inches); (B) Net length: 1.829 meters (6 feet); (C) The net must be white, and each mesh is three-quarters of an inch; (D) A light brown edge of three-quarters of an inch wide is sewn on the upper end of the net; (E) The two sides must be tightly attached to the ping pong posts, and the lower end must be connected to the table surface; (F) It must be taut and straight.

The ping pong posts are installed on the table edge in the middle of both sides of the table, extending 15.2 cm (6 inches) from the table surface, the top of the post is 15.2 cm (6 inches) above the table surface, and at right angles to the table.

### Lying Without Restraint

— Xu Zhuo-zhi

Western customs can work in China in every way, except for April Fool's Day, which will never work.

Why? Because the Chinese people have been fooled and deceived for thousands of years, kept in the dark. Since they are being fooled 365 days a year, why bother to specify a day as April Fool's Day?

This Western holiday is translated as "Fool's Day" in Chinese. The word "fool" is really too elegant and difficult to understand. In fact, it may as well be translated directly as "Liar's Day" or "Lying Day." Why should lying have a holiday? Because people usually don't lie much, they are not allowed to lie, but lying is a kind of latent desire in human nature, so this day is specifically set to let everyone lie to their heart's content, which is also giving this emotion an official release. As for us? Deceiving people is proper, lying is commonplace. Which day are the common people not being deceived, fooled? Today, you exchange two gold yuan for one silver dollar, and tomorrow, you sell it back to you for seven thousand yuan, making you a profit of 3,500 times out of thin air!

Didn't the sage say long ago: "When you want to be wise, you want the soldiers to be foolish." Why do you want to be wise? Because you can deduct military pay and eat empty salaries; why do you want the soldiers to be foolish? Because you can make them share five hundred gold yuan among three people and still endure it. By extension, naturally officials want to be wise and the people want to be foolish, so all kinds of deceiving and fooling the people are just the military following the teachings of the sage.

In a place where everyone talks and everyone deceives, it is difficult not to lie. If everyone calls a deer a horse, calls black white, and if you are the only one who says this is a deer, this is black, then you will not only be ridiculed, but you may even face death. Chinese politics has always used lying to deceive the people as the only rule for thousands of years; and the common people themselves have also used mutual fraud as the foundation for establishing themselves in the world. Under such circumstances, since lying is commonplace, then it would be too much trouble to set a fixed holiday for lying.

April Fool's Day will not work in China. The day it works is a blessing for the Chinese people.

### Tablet of Inferior Governance

— Xiao Ji-shi

During the Tang Dynasty, Liu Gongquan and He Jin-tao both had "Tablets of Virtuous Governance."

During the Jin Dynasty, Wang Jun of Fufeng had virtuous governance, and the western people erected a tablet for him, and all who saw it bowed down. These two did not lose the meaning of "Tablet of Virtuous Governance."

However, looking at the officials who are mostly "hypocritical" and the many who flatter them, I am afraid that many are using trusted subordinates to collude with inferior gentry to fabricate "virtuous governance" and erect "political tablets."

Therefore, Bai Juyi's poem about green stone has: "I don't want to be a tablet of virtuous governance by the roadside for officials, not to engrave the real record but to engrave false words." It is not only satire to the bone, but also a realistic portrayal.

According to a report in this newspaper on the 28th, "Ye Chun-jie, the magistrate of Chongqing County, Sichuan, was recently transferred due to a case. The people of the county, in order to commemorate his various inferior deeds of corruption and exploitation during his tenure, specially presented him with a Tablet of Inferior Governance, erected in the county to commemorate his departure. The couplet is: 'Going early, the numbers have eyes; leaving late a few days, the land has no skin.' The horizontal inscription says: 'Forever leave an infamous name.'" It is written directly and frankly. The so-called "leaving late a few days, the land has no skin" refers to the officials' extortion, which is the case everywhere. All crows in the world are black, and it is not only the magistrate of Chongqing County who is like this.

The world is difficult, and "extortion" is everywhere. We truly admire the boldness of the people of Chongqing County, who "speak frankly and directly." But China is so big, I am afraid that even the green stone of Lantian Mountain cannot fully engrave "Tablets of Inferior Governance," right?

### Fool

— Zhang Qi-qu

Do you remember? Today—April 1st—is April Fool's Day! Be careful not to be fooled!

The custom of April Fool's Day originated in the West and is called April-fool, or All Fools' Day. Before the war, some people in China "used Western learning for practical purposes." At that time, a newspaper in Beiping published a small news item saying that Dr. Hu Shi had died of a sudden illness last night. That day, Hu Shi's relatives, friends, and students were shocked and rushed to Hu's residence to offer condolences. When they saw Hu Shi sitting at home safe and sound, they realized they had been fooled. However, although those who were fooled were annoyed, they were always happier than seeing "really dead," so they just laughed it off.

The following year, a newspaper in Nanjing published a marriage announcement on its cover of the famous painter Xu Beihong and Jiang Biwei. They were originally an old couple and had been married in France long ago. How could they be getting married again now? It turned out that the two of them were having some minor disputes at the time, which had the potential to turn small matters into big ones. Therefore, someone deliberately made a joke to them, as a fool or as a satire, and the parties and those involved in the dispute could not pursue it because it occurred on April Fool's Day.

Last year's April Fool's Day was also quite lively in Shanghai. Among them, the most eye-catching news was the suicide of painter Liu Shi and movie star Ouyang Shafei. The former was reported by Xu Xin-qin, Liu Shi's close friend, and the latter even had photos as proof, so many people were fooled.

According to Western customs, although anyone can lie on this day, they must immediately say that it is April Fool's after the other party is fooled or just about to be fooled, to avoid making a big mistake. This is the morality that a fool should have.

It is also necessary to choose the material for fooling carefully. Rumors like those mentioned above, although they harm people temporarily, do not cause much harm. But if you directly accuse someone who has contributed to the country of being a criminal, or falsely accuse a hero who has benefited the people of being a bandit, even if you are not punished by law on April Fool's Day, it is still a bit unkind.

Secondly, you can't make jokes in the most tense moments. If someone were to spread a rumor today saying, "The Communist Army in Jiangbei has fully crossed the Yangtze River, and peace talks have been suspended as a result," this joke would not only be too big, but also too immoral.

This is what the fool should pay attention to. As for the person being fooled, although they may be a little angry, they do not have to be suspicious of everything on this day. For example, if there is news today that "Wu Guozhen has been transferred to the Minister of Foreign Affairs," that may be "fooling"; but if he suspects it is fake even if he goes to Hangzhou today, then he is being too sensitive.

By analogy, for example, in the peace talks held in Beiping, the conditions put forward by both sides may not be completely free of "fooling" components; but if the representatives all have the heart of "Don't fool me there?" because today is April Fool's Day, then it will not be easy to reach an agreement. Therefore, the fool should have the morality of a fool, and the person being fooled must also have the magnanimity to tolerate others, so as not to become a real fool.

### Not Lying Is Abnormal

— Bin-zhi

If someone asks you: "Do you lie?" You will definitely answer in the negative, "No." In fact, the number of people who have never told a lie in their lives is the smallest of the smallest. Someone once did a statistic proving that 97 percent of people have lied, most of them occasionally, and a few habitually.

Two professors at Yale University have done detailed research on lying. They spent four years surveying 11,000 people and found that the number of lies told is inversely proportional to intelligence; the smarter the person, the fewer lies they tell; but even the most intelligent people cannot avoid telling some lies.

Since lying is a behavior that most people have, it is naturally a normal phenomenon; conversely, not lying becomes a symptom of abnormality. However, society still praises the abnormal "honesty" and despises the normal "lying." Therefore, people generally still refuse to admit this exceptional normal behavior, but instead point to lying as abnormal, which is actually a psychological contradiction.

Everyone knows that honesty is a virtue, but why do people lie? Isn't that strange? In fact, people have to be somewhat artificial in order to adapt to the environment. The most common thing is that in a large gathering, when talking to polite people, you always have to say a few polite words, and there are untrue words among them. Although these words are insignificant, a lie is still a lie. Isn't adapting to the environment a normal behavior?

In court, the words of the criminal cannot be completely true. Although the judge uses various methods to interrogate the criminal, it is difficult to obtain the complete truth. Committing a crime is a dishonorable act, and lying is also improper. He chooses to lie to avoid the more serious and lessen his crime. This is seeking to live, seeking to survive, and of course it is also a normal psychological expression.

When a doctor sees a very serious patient, he always has to hide some of the truth from the patient, not willing to tell the patient the real situation himself, for fear that the patient will become more ill from fear and worry. Of course, there are a few lies in the doctor's words to the patient. In this situation, lying cannot be said to be wrong; kindness and sympathy are also normal phenomena that should be present in the psychology.

The above is about intentional lying. There is also lying without knowing it. Especially in a sudden occurrence, because attention is not concentrated, words of guesswork are often mixed in. Someone once showed a film of a car accident to many people, and after watching it, asked them to answer a few questions. As a result, almost everyone got the things in the film a little wrong, only the degree of wrongness varied. No one answered all twenty questions correctly. Therefore, the words of eyewitnesses are often lies, but they are unintentional.
