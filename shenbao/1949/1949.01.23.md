### Acting President Li's Announcement to the People: Resolving to Seek Peace with Utmost Effort, All Laws and Decrees Contradicting Democratic Principles Will Be Swiftly Abolished

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Acting President Li today (22nd) issued the following announcement: President Chiang Kai-shek has resolutely retired. Zongren, mindful of the righteousness of saving the country and its people, has stepped forward to shoulder this arduous task. The suffering of the nation and its people from the current war has reached an unbearable level. Seeking peace to end the war is the unanimous cry of the entire nation. At the beginning of my tenure, I wish to inform all my fellow countrymen that the government will, from today, seek the realization of peace with the utmost sincerity and effort. I know this task is exceptionally arduous, but for the sake of the country and its people, Zongren will do everything possible to achieve it. As long as peace can be realized soon and the country can embark on the path of peaceful reconstruction, Zongren will not consider his personal advancement or retreat. This sincere heart should be witnessed by all fellow countrymen.

After eight years of war against Japan, followed by three years of civil war, not only was the glimmer of hope for national revival after victory in the war against Japan completely destroyed, but the scourge of war spread throughout both north and south of the Yellow River. Fields and homes were destroyed and abandoned. The deaths and injuries of innocent people numbered in the tens of thousands. Wives were separated from their husbands, children scattered, and cries of hunger and cold were heard everywhere. This catastrophic calamity is unprecedented in our country's civil war history. Our commitment to the National Revolution was originally to save the country and its people. We should end the war as soon as possible and bring about peace and harmony so that we can preserve the vitality of the nation and leave a chance of survival for the people. Otherwise, if the war continues to drag on, the country will be plunged into an abyss from which it can never recover. Now that the whole country is unanimously calling for peace, not only is the government determined to respect public opinion, but the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has also expressed its willingness to negotiate. Based on this same belief and sincere heart of forbearance for the sake of the country, no matter how difficult the future may be, Zongren believes that peace will eventually be realized.

Now, to show sincerity and determination, the government will remove all obstacles to peace. All past laws and actions that have hindered the people's freedom and contradicted democratic principles will be swiftly abolished or suspended, in order to foster a peaceful atmosphere in the country and allow the peace talks to proceed smoothly. As for the eight conditions proposed by the CCP, the government is willing to start negotiations immediately. Representatives have already been appointed. Once the CCP responds with a location for negotiations, the peace talks can be held. Furthermore, in order to gather wisdom from all sources and make the task easier with everyone's support, Zongren has also sent telegrams inviting all political parties and peace-loving individuals in society to provide their support. In short, from now on, the government's work will focus on striving for the realization of peace, and my personal service will be guided by the will of the people. I also hope that all my fellow countrymen will work together to achieve this great undertaking. The future of the nation is deeply dependent on it.

### The Executive Yuan Held an Extraordinary Political Affairs Meeting Yesterday: The Peace Negotiation Delegation Was Appointed, Including Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Peng Zhaoxian, Huang Shaohong, and Zhong Tianxin; They Will Depart Immediately After the CCP Proposes a Negotiation Location

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] In order to swiftly seek the early realization of peace, the Executive Yuan convened an extraordinary political affairs meeting at 6 p.m. on the 22nd to discuss and decide on the selection of members for the delegation to negotiate with the CCP. After smooth passage at the meeting, it was decided that Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Peng Zhaoxian, Huang Shaohong, and Zhong Tianxin would form the delegation, with Shao Lizi as the chief representative, responsible for leading and convening meetings of the delegation and planning negotiation methods. As for the departure date and negotiation location, it was decided to be "a suitable location agreed upon by both parties," but it is hoped that the CCP can propose a location as soon as possible, so that the delegation can travel there as soon as possible. After the Executive Yuan's decision became known to the general public, their hope for peace became even more ardent.

### Mr. Shao Expresses His Thoughts

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Mr. Shao Lizi, the chief representative of the delegation appointed by the Executive Yuan to negotiate with the CCP, met with reporters on the evening of the 22nd and expressed his thoughts after accepting the mission. Mr. Shao first stated: "I feel very apprehensive upon receiving this order and believe that the delegation's mission is extremely arduous, but I am determined to do my best to achieve the goal of peace." Mr. Shao said: "There have been many years of rifts between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, leading to this cruel war. The recent expressions made by both sides (referring to the President's New Year's Day message and Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation) are far apart, so this mission will be extremely difficult. However, since peace is urgently needed by everyone, and it is even more necessary to preserve the nation's vitality, both sides have now seen this point. I believe that if everyone is sincere, peace can be achieved." Mr. Shao emphasized: "Therefore, I also feel that this mission is achievable. The members of the delegation will definitely do their utmost to promote the smooth progress of the peace talks so that the war can end as soon as possible." Regarding the location of the negotiations, Mr. Shao said that we sincerely hope that the CCP can reply as soon as possible, especially by proposing a location for negotiations, so that the negotiations can begin as soon as possible. When reporters asked whether a ceasefire would be the first issue discussed after the negotiations begin, Mr. Shao said no. As for the procedure and basis for the negotiations, he believed that neither the conditions proposed in the President's message nor the conditions in Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation could be insisted upon, otherwise, the talks would not be able to continue. Therefore, all issues will be discussed after the negotiations begin. Mr. Shao's mood was very cheerful today. During his conversation with reporters, Mr. Shao received a phone call from someone who claimed to be a small citizen of Nanjing. This citizen undoubtedly admired Mr. Shao's efforts to promote peace and heard about his new mission today. He only asked Mr. Shao one question: "Is there hope for peace?" Mr. Shao replied, "Everyone hopes for peace, so there is hope for peace." As the reporters were leaving, Mr. Shao added, "I hope not to disappoint everyone's hopes and to achieve the goal of peace."

Peace has become the unanimous call of the nation today, and only ending the war and seeking peace can save the people and the country. Despite my limited abilities, I have taken on this arduous task. I can only do my best to promote the realization of peace. We have known each other for a long time, and this sincere intention should be understood. The CCP has expressed its willingness to negotiate. If we can forbear for the sake of the country, success will not be difficult to achieve. I am not only willing to make the greatest effort, but also have unlimited confidence in this. You, brother, have been advocating peace for many years with painstaking effort, which is admired by the whole country. At this time of hardship, I ask you to provide detailed guidance to follow. If you can invite democratic and peace-loving individuals from the north to come to Beijing together to discuss and promote this, to comfort the expectations of the public, and allow me to relinquish my responsibilities early, it would be my greatest hope. This special telegram is sent to await your virtuous reply. Your younger brother, Li Zongren. (January) Yang (22nd) Secret Seal."

(2) "To Mr. Bojun and Dongsun and all gentlemen of your league: Eight years of war against Japan, three years of civil strife, the nation's vitality has been almost exhausted. I, with my limited abilities, am trying to support the precarious situation. I deeply know that only by ending the war and seeking peace can we save the people from fire and water. I have decided to make the greatest effort to seek the realization of peace. And to show my determination and sincerity, the government has decided to abolish and suspend the laws and actions that have hindered the people's freedom in the past. The CCP has now expressed its willingness to negotiate. If we can forbear for the sake of the country, success will not be difficult to achieve. Gentlemen, you have worked hard for peace, and your spirit and perseverance are admired by the whole country. I ask you to unanimously advocate and strongly support this. If peace can be realized one day sooner, I can return to my original position one day sooner. Please provide your insights at any time to correct my shortcomings. This special telegram is sent to express my thoughts. I cannot express all my desires. I hope you understand. Your younger brother, Li Zongren. (January) Yang (22nd)"

[This City News] A spokesman for the Democratic Socialist Party stated in a written statement on the 22nd regarding the President's retirement: "Mr. Chiang led the Northern Expedition, unified the country, and directed the War of Resistance, defeating the brutal Japanese.

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] After the President's abdication announcement, Zhang Shenfu recently made a statement in Beiping, believing that President Chiang's announcement is a major key to resolving the current situation.

After three years of cruel civil war, after countless twists and turns, sacrificing countless lives and property of the people, the comrades have also sacrificed many lives for this struggle, and recently many members have lost their freedom. Now, fortunately, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek is seeking peace through abdication, and the CCP has already issued peace conditions. We hope that there will be further development as soon as possible, so that peace can be realized soon. We firmly believe that this is the unanimous wish of the people of the whole country."

### Specific Measures of China's New Economic Policy

— Shou Miancheng

(The eight principles of the New Economic Policy were published on January 10th. The specific measures are now published below.)

(1) Property and Income

China's New Economic Policy should implement a socialization of private property system, maintaining the private ownership of property while restricting its scope and benefits. Those that must be nationalized due to special reasons are not subject to this restriction. For example, public ownership of land and other property is indeed a system, but some property is earned through labor, while some is obtained through luck or speculation. It is difficult to be fair and reasonable if all are nationalized. Moreover, before the people's socialization concept is formed, it will inevitably have a negative impact on production efficiency. Furthermore, the problem of the property system is not just about ownership, but about the right to use and enjoy. If various restrictions can be placed on the owner, then maintaining the private ownership system can be said to be beneficial and without harm.

The income of the people's work shall be determined according to the quantity and quality of their work. All people of working age and with working ability should engage in work that is beneficial to society. Those without work opportunities shall be allocated by the government. Regarding the income of each person, some previously advocated equal treatment for all. This system is unreasonable and will lead people to not work hard, which is extremely detrimental. Soviet Russia once adopted it, but soon abolished it. What all people should equally enjoy is the minimum standard of living permitted by the level of social production. However, those with stronger abilities and more work must be given a standard of living above the minimum to be motivated. Some say that the strength of ability is not innate. This is another question. Although the level of ability should be universally improved in the future, after the level of ability is improved, income may also increase accordingly, which is still fair. However, society still constantly needs to encourage special abilities; otherwise, the level of ability will not be able to be promoted forward.

People who are not of working age or lack the ability to work should be provided with a minimum standard of living by the government, or temporarily borne by those in society with surplus income. The elderly, young, disabled, and pregnant women in society, although they have no work income, still have to maintain their lives. The cost of this living should be borne by the government in principle; however, in Chinese society, due to the large population, the lack of women's working ability, and the special family system, if all expenses are paid by the government, it will only increase unnecessary burdens. It seems that it can be stipulated that only when the number of people borne by income below a certain standard exceeds a certain standard can government subsidies be requested.

The increase in population should be adjusted to be compatible with the productivity of land and resources.

All people in the country who are of working age, have the ability to work, and have access to work should join social insurance so that the living expenses of those who are unemployed, sick, and deceased can be provided.

(2) Agriculture and Industry

Agricultural raw materials for daily necessities and agricultural products necessary for life should be produced by farmers organizing township and town cooperatives, family production cooperatives, or cooperative farms. The most appropriate way for farmers to organize cooperatives to sort out land rights, improve land use, promote excellent varieties and technologies, and develop farmland water conservancy and rural sideline industries is through cooperative organizations. There are precedents in various countries, even Soviet Russia is no exception. Cooperative farms should be based on adjacent fields with the same water conservancy needs to facilitate the sorting out of boundaries and the construction of water conservancy facilities.

Each cooperative and cooperative farm should individually or jointly set up agricultural warehouses under the control of the government. All kinds of bulk agricultural products should first be paid into the agricultural warehouses, and the control agency shall allocate and sell them at reasonable prices, except for the part used by the members of the cooperative.

State-owned farms should be temporarily limited to demonstrative and promotional farms. After successful operation, they should be gradually expanded. In the provinces south of the Yangtze River in China, most of the farmland is paddy fields, and the population is large, so large-scale mechanized farming cannot be adopted; even if it can, it is not in line with economic principles. Therefore, it is not appropriate to hold a large number of these state-owned farms. If it can indeed generate demonstration and promotion effects, the rural cooperatives and cooperative farms should be given more convenience in promotion. As for private farmland, it should be limited to sporadic agricultural products that are not suitable for operation by cooperative farms or state-owned farms.

Fisheries and animal husbandry, except for the part belonging to rural sideline industries, should be handled by the government guiding the people of each industry to organize cooperatives, and processing facilities should be attached. In addition to public forests, afforestation can also be operated by organizing afforestation cooperatives. Because fishermen and herdsmen all have a certain area and lead a hard life, due to the nature of production and geographical relationship, they are most vulnerable to the exploitation of middlemen; therefore, they should be guided to organize cooperative operations. Forest farms can be operated by governments at all levels, but small-scale forest farms in counties and villages should adopt cooperative organizations. As for the key industries of agriculture, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry, such as the manufacture of agricultural machinery and agricultural pest and insect drugs, sawmilling machinery and equipment, fishing boats and cold storage for fisheries, and processing and slaughtering equipment for animal husbandry, before the cooperatives can operate independently, they should be temporarily operated by the government or assisted by the cooperatives.

The production of daily necessities should be operated by consumer cooperatives or joint associations in various places setting up cooperative factories; workers can also organize industrial production cooperatives to form a triangular cooperation with agricultural cooperatives and consumer cooperatives. Because consumer cooperatives are organizations of consumers, operating production through them will surely achieve the goal of genuine goods at fair prices. In countries where consumer cooperation is developed, such as the United Kingdom and Sweden, the goods supplied by their consumer cooperatives are all products of their large-scale factories. Industrial cooperatives organized by the workers themselves can improve the status of workers, transforming them from employees to factory owners, so as to prevent the occurrence of labor unrest. At the same time, because it is the workers' own organization, it can reduce the waste of resources and improve production efficiency. At the same time, cooperative factories and industrial cooperatives should individually or jointly set up warehouses under the control of the government. Their products, except for the part used by members or factory staff, shall be allocated and sold by the control agency at reasonable prices.

State-owned factories should be limited to demonstrative and controlling industries and factories of various heavy industries. The products and technologies required by the cooperatives should be given as much convenience as possible to the various cooperatives. China's state-owned factories are not yet very developed, and there are many that should be established in the future; however, in the past, due to limited funding and loans, and the opposition of private factories, they could not be fully expanded. Recently, there has even been a proposal to transfer the original state-owned factories to private management, which is completely due to the wrong concept of finance and should be corrected immediately. However, state-owned industry is very prone to becoming bureaucratic, resulting in various wastes, which should be avoided as much as possible.

Private factories must be licensed by the government and have personnel sent to supervise their production and income. Existing factories operated by private individuals should be sorted out or merged separately, and personnel should be sent to supervise their production and income. The products of these factories, except for their own use, should also be sent to the warehouses designated by the government, and the control agency shall allocate and sell them at fair and reasonable prices.

Handicraft is an industry that does not meet modern standards, but it should still be maintained during the transition period. Because there are special handicrafts in various parts of China, although they are already outdated, there is a surplus of labor in various places. If they are not maintained, they will inevitably lose their jobs. Moreover, these handicrafts are not without artistic meaning. Among export materials, they are the least competitive with other countries. Therefore, during the transition period, they still have the value of protection.

Various heavy industries, except for those related to national defense secrets, should be encouraged to receive international investment and completed on schedule. Heavy industry requires huge capital and high technology, so international investment should be encouraged, but all departments should have Chinese professionals participating in the work, and it should be stipulated that various manufacturing technologies must be absolutely open. Foreign experts should also be responsible for training Chinese professional learners so that they can manufacture independently. (Continued on page four)

### Communist Army Attacks Amidst Peace Talks; Abandoning Mingguang, Jiashan, and Zhangbaling South of the Huai River; Anhui Communist Army Enters Hefei County Seat

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Liu Ruming's troops in central Anhui voluntarily abandoned Hefei today. The Communist army has entered the city. Chaoxian is still in the hands of the National Army. In the eastern part of Hanshan County, 1,000 local communists are advancing towards the county seat.

[Our Newspaper, Chuxian, 22nd] The war in the southern section of the Jinpu Railway south of the Huai River has officially begun. The 12th Column of Chen Yi's Communist Army, together with Jiang Wei's Independent Brigade and the 34th Brigade, scurried towards Jiashan and Zhangbaling, south of Mingguang, at around 1:00 a.m. on the 21st. The National Army's Yang Gancai's troops inflicted heavy blows on the invading Communist army according to the established plan, and covered Hu Changqing's troops to safely retreat southward from Mingguang. They then took the initiative to withdraw to Zhangbaling and its southern areas on the morning of the 22nd. The National Army suffered a loss of only more than 180 people. The trains from Pukou northwards on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway now run to Chuxian. Li Yannian, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison and Commander of the 6th Army Corps, originally stationed in Chuxian, moved to Puzhen on the 22nd to take command.

[Our Newspaper, Chuxian, 22nd] The National Army voluntarily abandoned Zhangbaling Station this morning.

Also, it is not yet known whether the four columns of Liu Bocheng's troops who had previously scurried to Bengbu will continue to act.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] According to today's air force reconnaissance report: The National Army's retreating troops are slowly marching south along the road from Zhangbaling to Shaheji. The Shaheji railway bridge has been destroyed. After crossing the Huai River, the Communist army divided into two routes, advancing towards Pukou along the Jinpu Railway and the Xuyi Ancient City Line on its east side. A vanguard of more than 1,000 Communist troops advancing southward along the front of the Jinpu Railway has now crossed Mingguang Jiashan and advanced towards Zhangbaling (another two regiments advanced westward from Jiashan). Another group of Communist troops advancing southward on the east side of Jinpu, about 10,000 people in Gucheng, and 2,000 people from the Huainan and Huaibei Independent Brigades in Zilaiqiao, have reached Zhangpuying (60 li from Chuxian). Three regiments of the Communist army are advancing towards Huangnigang, 40 li north of Chuxian. Both routes of the Communist army are advancing southward with Chuxian as their target. The National Army's Yang Gancai's 20th Army and the 99th and 96th Armies are stationed there. If the National Army does not retreat again, it will inevitably engage in battle with the southward Communist army. It is understood that the National Army may retreat further south to comply with the political decision to seek peace.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Due to the continued retreat of the National Army in northern Jiangsu, Taixian was abandoned on the evening of the 21st. After four regiments of the Communist army pushed into the county seat, they continued to advance towards the port town on the north bank of the Yangtze River. About 15 regiments of the Communist army between Jiangyan and Huangqiao are approaching Taixing and Jingjiang counties on the north bank of the Yangtze River. Although two regiments of the Communist army have arrived northwest of Yangzhou, the county seat of Yangzhou is still in the hands of the National Army.

### Two Fires Broke Out in Suzhou Yesterday
The Girls' Department of Guanghua Middle School was Completely Destroyed

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 22nd] The weather is dry and windy, and fire alarms are frequent. The residence of Xu Boming, a Suzhou gentleman, at No. 31 Gaoshi Lane, which was used as the school building for the girls' department of Guanghua Middle School, suddenly suffered a fire at around 7:00 p.m. tonight. At that time, all the fire trucks in the city were going to a fire at a firecracker shop on Shantang Street to extinguish the fire, which caused the fire to spread very quickly. When the fire trucks heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, they were unable to rescue due to the high walls and narrow alleys. As a result, the seven-story school building and all the desks and chairs were completely destroyed. Fortunately, the school had already closed for vacation, and there were no deaths or injuries.

### Peace Sounds High, Prices Fall; Different Reactions to the President's Retirement in Various Places

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 22nd] After the President announced his retirement to seek peace, all walks of life here expressed their support for the authorities' tolerance for the country, and generally believed that this kind of sincerity would be very helpful to the future of peace. The people's representatives and local gentry of Hubei Province, who first hoped for peace, are now planning to send representatives to negotiate peace with Liu Bocheng, commander of the Central China Communist Army. Therefore, although there are repeated reports of frequent movements of the Communist Army in southern Henan and northern Hubei, the people's hearts in Wuhan are still very stable, and the black market for gold and silver and daily commodity prices have slightly fallen again today.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 22nd] Li Pinxian, Deputy Commander-in-Chief and Chairman of the Political Committee of the Central China Bandit Suppression Headquarters, invited the news media here this afternoon to discuss the main points of the current situation as follows: (1) The President's announcement of his retirement to seek peace shows the government's loyalty to the people and the country. We should concentrate our will and concentrate our strength to strive for genuine peace. (2) The Central China region once led the way to peace. We should provide as much assistance as possible to those who are beneficial to the people. Those who do not understand the true meaning of peace should be widely publicized to ensure that the opinions of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are close. (3) The eight conditions proposed by the Communist Party have room for negotiation. We hope that both sides will meet each other with sincerity and promote the early realization of peace.

[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 22nd] After President Chiang Kai-shek announced his retirement, Cheng Qian answered reporters' questions, believing that the President's retirement was the most great and sincere expression of following public opinion and seeking peace. Vice President Li is a good comrade and an old friend. In the future, we should work together to achieve peace. Regarding the way to stabilize Hunan Province in the future, Cheng said that everyone should be upright and sincere, align their steps, and move towards the road of peace in unison, without vying to be first, which is the power of stability.

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 22nd] Our reporter interviewed Chen Yi, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, who had just returned to Hangzhou from Beijing with the President in the same plane yesterday evening. He asked what changes would occur in the overall situation after the President's retirement? How would Chen and the Zhejiang Provincial Government under his jurisdiction respond? Chen said: Although the President has retired, the Vice President will act as his agent and perform his duties, and the local government will still implement the instructions of the Central Government. He himself did not want to comment on the current situation. However, when the reporter asked about the Hangzhou City Council's suggestion to the Central Government and the Communist Party to designate Hangzhou City as a demilitarized zone, Chen replied that this was an outdated idea. He wanted to know that today is a domestic war, not an international war invaded by foreign tribes.

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 22nd] The President retired, and prices fell sharply.

[Our Newspaper, Guilin, 22nd] After the news of the President's retirement came out, the local newspapers issued extra editions late last night, and every household hung flags and fired cannons this morning to express their support.

[Our Newspaper, Guiyang, 22nd] After the news of the President's retirement, the newspapers issued extra editions, and the city's situation declined today.

[Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 22nd] When the news of President Chiang Kai-shek's retirement arrived here, prices fell. An extra edition of a certain newspaper was sold for 60 yuan, but there were still many patrons.

### After President Chiang Kai-shek Announced His Retirement, the US Responds Differently; Many Members of Congress Believe the US Has a Responsibility

[United Press, Washington, 21st] Official and political observations focused on China on the 21st, with different reactions to President Chiang Kai-shek's retirement. Some believed that China might achieve some kind of peace, while others believed that President Chiang Kai-shek's departure from Beijing would be "disastrous." The responses from various parties are listed below:

On the State Department side, officially, "no opinion was expressed." However, the coldness of the State Department towards President Chiang Kai-shek has long been recognized.

On the Congressional side, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally denied that this move meant the end of the Nationalist Government. He hoped that "China can still produce a strong regime to promote stability in the Far East."

Republican Senator Zhou Yide, who advocated for aid to China, said that the United States bears some responsibility and that the United States should intervene in the Communist Party to promote a truce.

Bloom, who is about to become Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that he hopes China will produce a leader who will win the war. Bloom also said that if a solution is reached to establish a coalition government with the participation of the Communist Party, he does not agree with the current peaceful settlement. He said, "China has not been completely defeated. It is not too late to save China from communism if China establishes a new government."

Senator Brewster said, "Based on history, Chiang's retirement will be regarded as a great tragedy of our time."

McLaw, who submitted a bill to Congress for comprehensive aid to the Kuomintang, said: "This is the result of our hands-off policy" and said: "If President Chiang Kai-shek's retirement leads to the establishment of a coalition government, the bill he proposed must be withdrawn or revised."

[United Press, Washington, 21st] US officials are closely watching the situation caused by the sudden retirement of Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek. Although some members of Congress have criticized President Truman for failing to actively assist Chiang in resisting communism, the White House and the State Department have remained silent for the time being. According to authoritative sources, as long as there is an anti-communist government, the funds allocated by Congress for aid to China will be preserved, and the United States will continue to aid China. Once China is completely controlled by the Communist Party, the attitude of the United States is a mystery in American foreign policy. The newly appointed Secretary of State Acheson took office in a hurry today, and it is expected that the situation in China will be the first to receive his attention. It is heard that Hoffman, Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration, plans to hold a meeting with Acheson to discuss current and future plans.

### MacArthur Expresses Pessimism

[United Press Far East General Manager Fang En, Tokyo, 22nd] High-ranking American and Chinese officials here on the 22nd received the news of President Chiang Kai-shek's retirement and departure from Beijing and the Chinese government's intensified preparations for peace talks with considerable pessimism. The general opinions of these people are as follows: (1) The chances of Acting President Li Zongren successfully uniting with the Communist Party are extremely slim, because the Communist Party has repeatedly emphasized that they intend to expand their political strategy to the whole of China, and their purpose is to cooperate closely with the Soviet Union. (2) The Communist Party will inevitably regard President Chiang Kai-shek's "temporary retirement" as a sign that Nanjing is prepared to accept their conditions, and therefore, they are unwilling to ease the terms they have previously announced.

MacArthur did not elaborate on this situation because China is not within his jurisdiction, but he clearly expressed extreme pessimism, believing that the entire Chinese mainland will be brought into the orbit of the Soviet Union.

### British Foreign Office Makes No Comment

[French News Agency, London, 21st] Circles close to the British Foreign Office have so far made no comment on President Chiang Kai-shek's retirement. However, they believe that the new government formed as a result of the peace talks between the CCP and the Kuomintang is only a constitutional change agreed to by the Nanjing government and will not lead to the issue of new recognition by various countries. If a government is seized by force, this problem may inevitably arise. Official circles all said that if the CCP government can fulfill the constitutional requirements of accepting the usual practice under international law, they will not oppose recognizing it.

### Hong Kong Compatriots Are Both Shocked and Afraid

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 22nd] The news of President Chiang Kai-shek's retirement was published on the front page of both Chinese and English newspapers here. The people were both shocked and afraid after learning about it. The Chinese newspapers here all wrote long editorials on the matter.

### French Officials Are Not Surprised

[French News Agency, Paris, 22nd] French officials here were not surprised to receive the news of President Chiang Kai-shek's departure from Beijing. French officials hope that the negotiations on peace terms with the Communist Party and the formation of a new government can proceed smoothly. French officials generally expressed that there is no need to worry about French people and property in China. They believe that the CCP will fulfill its promise to protect them. There are few comments on this matter in the French morning newspapers, but they have published more extensive reports from China than usual.

### Still No Disclosure from the Soviets

[United Press International, Moscow, 21st] As of the evening of the 21st, President Chiang's resignation had not been announced here. Newspapers and radio stations were busy all day commemorating the 25th anniversary of Lenin's death. Since the announcement of Mao Zedong's peace terms on the 19th without commentary, no news from the Chinese side has been published. The Soviet newspapers' attitude towards President Chiang will probably not be disclosed within the next few days.

### Asian Conference Resolves to Request the Security Council to Restore Full Sovereignty to Indonesia, Order the Netherlands to Withdraw Troops and Hand Over Administrative Power by the End of This Year, Participating Countries Consider Establishing a Pan-Asian League

[Special Dispatch] New York, 22nd (Radio): New Delhi Dispatch: The Asian Conference held a secret meeting tonight and formally passed a recommendation to the Security Council, requesting the Security Council to order the withdrawal of Dutch troops from Indonesian territory before January 1, 1950, and to take necessary actions to promote its realization. The representatives of the 19 countries participating today unanimously requested the Security Council to authorize the Mediation Committee or other newly established body to formulate steps to ensure that full administrative power in the Indonesian region is handed over to the Indonesian Federation before January 1, 1950. How Dutch-Indonesian relations will be at that time will be decided by both parties through consultation. The representatives of the 19 countries unanimously expressed their willingness to support the Security Council. The 19 countries also telegraphed UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, requesting: (1) the Netherlands to immediately release Indonesian political prisoners; (2) the Indonesian Republic should have complete freedom in exercising its political power; (3) the Indonesian territory in Java, Sumatra, and Madura occupied by Dutch troops since December 18 last year should be fully returned; (4) the Netherlands should lift the economic blockade; (5) an Indonesian Provisional Government should be established before March of this year; (6) representatives should be elected before October 1 to draft a constitution. The second resolution of the secret meeting was: Asian countries should maintain constant contact with the United Nations on the Indonesian issue. The third resolution was: The governments of the 19 countries are requested to study whether an organization can be established in the Asian region to enable the realization of a Pan-Asian League. A plenary session will be held this Sunday, and the above resolutions will be formally confirmed by the plenary session.

### Security Council to Debate Four-Nation Moderate Proposal on the 25th, Indonesian Representative Expresses Great Disappointment with the Proposal

[United Press International, Lake Success, 21st] The four countries of China, the United States, Norway, and Cuba formally submitted a proposal to the Security Council on the 21st, calling for the establishment of a fully independent United States of Indonesia on July 1, 1950. Soviet representative Malik immediately pointed out that the proposal was a "hypocritical" attempt to consolidate the Dutch occupation of Indonesia and make it legitimate. Indonesian representative Sjamsoeddin issued a statement expressing great disappointment with the four-nation plan.

However, the US delegation and its co-sponsors seemed confident that the plan to resolve the Indonesian dispute could obtain the necessary seven-vote majority, and that the Soviet Union would not use its veto to reject the proposal. When reporters asked Malik if his speech meant that the Soviet Union would use its veto, Malik said he would abstain. The Security Council adjourned today's debate shortly after 6:00 PM on the 21st and is scheduled to reconvene on the afternoon of the 25th. The proposal calls for the prompt restoration of the authority of the Indonesian Republic's government, but its scope is initially limited to the Republic's capital, Yogyakarta. Although Indonesia has demanded the immediate withdrawal of Dutch troops from their original defenses, the four-nation proposal does not stipulate the prompt withdrawal of Dutch troops from Indonesia. The entire proposal to end the current hostilities and to provide a detailed plan for the establishment of a United States of Indonesia is purely a "recommendation" and does not mention measures to force the Netherlands to comply. US representative Jessup told the Security Council that the four-nation plan was designed to achieve the "action" requested by both the Netherlands and Indonesia. He said: "The period of piecemeal negotiations is over." Attempts to force the immediate withdrawal of Dutch troops from Indonesia could cause serious difficulties, so the four countries advocated a cautious and gradual withdrawal plan. Jessup presented the main points of the plan and added that the issue was not "whether troops should withdraw, but the method and timing of the withdrawal, which must not cause greater difficulties." Chinese representative Chiang Ting-fu said that if a negotiated solution to the Indonesian dispute is to be achieved, the Republic's leaders must be released and their civil administration must be restored. Asked whether the Netherlands intended to achieve a solution in their own way, without allowing the Republic to be a political entity, Chiang said that judging from the statements of Dutch officials, the answer should be "no," but judging from Dutch actions, especially their defiance of the UN's December request to cease hostilities and release political leaders, the answer would inevitably be "yes." Dutch representative Van Dongen requested the Security Council to grant sufficient time to consult with The Hague on instructions before commenting on the four-nation proposal.

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 21st] China, the United States, Cuba, and Norway jointly proposed to the Security Council today that Indonesia be fully independent by July 1, 1950. The contents of the four-nation joint proposal are as follows: (1) Immediately cease all military actions; (2) Release all political prisoners and restore their full freedom; (3) Establish an all-Indonesian "Provisional Federal Government" before March 15, 1949, hold free general elections before October 1 of this year to establish an Indonesian Constituent Assembly, and hand over all Indonesian political power to a United States of Indonesia before July 1, 1950; (4) Reorganize the Security Council's Mediation Committee into an Indonesian Committee to supervise the implementation of this proposal and to oversee the gradual handover of territory to the Indonesian government.

### Japan to Hold General Election Today, 1,365 Candidates Running, Preliminary Voting Results May Be Announced Tonight

[United Press International, Tokyo, 22nd] Japanese voters will begin voting at 7:00 AM on the 23rd to elect members of the House of Representatives to form a new government. The biggest question is whether they can enable one party to hold enough seats in the Diet to implement a definite recovery plan without having to compromise with minority parties. Since the end of the war, no party has been able to establish a government capable of implementing a strong and definite plan. The characteristic of Japanese politics has been repeated compromise and constant haggling and struggle, resulting in a lack of genuine national leadership. The outcome of the election will also show whether Japan will lean to the right or fall into the communist camp of Asia. There are a total of 466 seats in the House of Representatives, and 1,365 candidates are running. Public reaction to the election campaign has generally remained lukewarm. Observers believe that this phenomenon will favor extreme right-wing elements and extreme left-wing elements. The Japanese Communist Party has particularly tried to take advantage of this lack of enthusiasm to make their candidates favorable and increase their strength. Observers generally agree that the number of seats held by the Japanese Communist Party will definitely increase. In the current situation, they can expect to win nine seats, more than doubling their original four seats. Election supervisors are eager for the election to be enthusiastic, and the weather is expected to be clear. MacArthur issued a specific order on the 22nd stating that all Japanese nationals serving in the occupying forces' agencies and personnel will be given the opportunity to vote in the election. Voting will begin at 7:00 AM and end at 7:00 PM, and preliminary trends in the vote count can be obtained around 10:00 PM Tokyo time on the 23rd. Although leftists are campaigning vigorously, it is generally believed that victory will belong to the extremely conservative Democratic Liberal Party, but it is doubtful whether the party will be able to obtain an absolute majority. If the party fails to obtain an absolute majority, Yoshida Shigeru will contact the Democratic Party to form a new conservative government. A recent public opinion poll by the "Mainichi Shimbun" predicted the results of the general election as follows:

Democratic Liberal Party: 218 seats

Socialist Party: 91 seats

Democratic Party: 89 seats

Cooperative Party: 20 seats

Communist Party: 9 seats

Social Renovation Party: 9 seats

Labor-Farmer Party: 7 seats

Other Minor Parties: 15 seats

Independents: 8 seats

### Gunfire Heard on North-South Korean Border, Syngman Rhee Reiterates Territorial Claim to Tsushima Island

[Associated Press, Seoul, 22nd] Officials announced today that gunfire had broken out on the border between South and North Korea, possibly due to an internal rebellion in North Korea. Details are unknown.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 21st] According to a broadcast from Seoul Radio, South Korean President Syngman Rhee stated that since the United Nations has the greatest responsibility for resolving the Korean issue, the UN Commission on Korea should ensure the withdrawal of Soviet troops from North Korea and cooperate with us to disarm the North Korean army. If not, this issue should be left to us to resolve ourselves. He also stated that the South Korean government's territorial claim to Tsushima Island remains unchanged. This claim will be directly negotiated with the Japanese government and may be decided by an international conference in the future.

### Western European Defense Plan Drafted, Five Countries Organize Allied Forces to Defend Territory from the Netherlands to Switzerland

[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st] The defense ministers of the five signatory countries of the Brussels Treaty met on the 14th of this month to draft a European defense plan, with a defense line stretching from the Netherlands to Switzerland. The meeting also decided on the number of troops that each country should provide for joint defense in the event of war. The plan will be submitted to the Western European Union's foreign ministers' meeting in London on the 25th. This defense line will be defended by highly mobile forces including French, British, Belgian, Dutch, and Luxembourgish troops when needed. This army will be composed of 30 mechanized divisions and five armored divisions supplied by France, and three mechanized divisions, one air force brigade, and armored units supplied by the Netherlands and Belgium. All three units will have appropriate air support to defend their territory. The meeting also drafted a plan to build strategic highways and equip North Sea ports to facilitate the supply of fuel needed by the Allied forces. The five defense ministers also achieved significant results in standardizing the equipment of the five countries' armed forces. Furthermore, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will manufacture war materials in their domestic factories, and US arsenals will also provide necessary weapons to assist them.

### Bao Dai Demands Complete Autonomy for Vietnam

The French Government Is Seriously Studying This

[United Press International, Washington, 21st] Usually reliable diplomatic sources said on the 21st that the United States is greatly encouraging Britain and France in Far Eastern affairs to cooperate with President Truman's policy of supporting new democracies in Asia, as outlined in his inaugural address. The sources said that for this reason, Britain and France have agreed to cooperate with the United States on its Indonesian policy in the United Nations, although British and French officials are deeply sympathetic to the Netherlands' position. They said that the possibility of France allowing most of Indochina to become independent under former King Bao Dai is very obvious, and the French government is now seriously studying Bao Dai's conditions, which include the freedom to establish Vietnamese embassies in Washington, New Delhi, and other places, to determine foreign policy, and to have complete control over the military. It is said that only under these conditions will Bao Dai be willing to return to Vietnam. The French government may have already made a decision, but the matter that needs to be seriously considered is the reaction of a substantially independent Indochina on French North Africa, especially the protectorates of Morocco and Tunisia. However, some French government officials have already believed that Bao Dai's conditions should be accepted.

[Associated Press, Hanoi, 20th] Nguyen Van Xuan, the prime minister of the French-protected central government of Vietnam, told Associated Press reporters today: "I plan to fly to Paris this spring to consult with the French government on the issue of the restoration of King Bao Dai." Nguyen also answered other questions as follows: Question: Will the French government take strong action against the Viet Minh delegation in Paris? Answer: The Viet Minh delegation's presence in Paris is purely a matter of French domestic policy, and we have no right to interfere. Question: Will the Vietnamese government be reorganized immediately? Answer: I will consult with Bao Dai first before answering.

### Tito Replies to Soviet Union, Moscow's Propaganda Offensive Will Not Change Yugoslavia's Course

[Central News Agency, Belgrade, 21st (United Press)] Marshal Tito recently told the Serbian Communist Party Congress that the Moscow radio station is conducting a multi-faceted propaganda campaign against Yugoslavia, an attack comparable to Hitler and Goebbels' attacks on the communist Soviet Union in the past. Tito said that the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries are now working together against Tito himself, which is the first time Tito has formally acknowledged the criticisms made against him by the Moscow radio station. Tito said that he himself, his party, and his country will continue on the same course, regardless of attacks from the East or West, and will urge the Cominform to promptly cancel its propaganda offensive. He added: "After six months of struggle with the Cominform, we can see how firm and solid our party is. No attack can harm it or break up its ranks."

### Soviet Union Breaks Silence on Chinese Situation, Praises Success of Leninism, Pospelov's Speech Targeted at Truman

[United Press International, Moscow, 21st] Pospelov, editor of the Communist Party newspaper Pravda, the main speaker at the Lenin Memorial Meeting on the 21st, said in front of Stalin and other senior leaders, "Communism is the intellectual center, honor, and conscience of this century. This new century will be the century of defeating capitalists." This speech can be regarded as a reply to President Truman's inaugural address, because Truman denounced communism as a false philosophy in his speech.

He continued, "The twentieth century is not the century of Wall Street, but the century in which the whole world completes Leninism, that is, Leninism-Stalinism." At this point, the audience responded with warm applause. Pospelov broke the Soviet newspapers' weeks-long silence on the victory of the Chinese Communist Party and said, "Countless Chinese people are becoming stronger and fighting to resist imperialism. Although American capitalists have armed their enemies, the People's Liberation Army has liberated many people and is continuing to advance. These many victories and the facts in Indochina, Indonesia, and elsewhere prove Stalin's words—colonialism is facing its end."

### Italian Communist Leader Criticizes Truman's Speech

Accuses It of Disguising Imperialism

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 21st] Italian Communist Party Secretary-General Togliatti told reporters from "Repubblica" today that in President Truman's speech, "what he did not mention is more interesting than what he has mentioned. His anti-communist policy is an abstract matter and has no political value. In fact, the policy of the American imperialist bloc has reached a crisis, because its policy is increasingly contrary to the wishes of democratic people and governments." Nenni, the leader of the Socialist Party, which holds a majority in parliament and supports communism, said, "Truman's speech cleverly disguised imperialism with empty declarations of humanity and principles. The collapse of British and American imperialism in China is a response from the people and events to certain people who still believe that they can make the world adopt positions and concepts that are historically outdated."

### Britain and the United States Eliminate Differences, Hope to Promote Middle East Peace, Britain Will Recognize Jewish State in Exchange for US Recognition of Transjordan

[Associated Press, London, 21st] Diplomatic sources predicted today that Britain will recognize Israel within days, and the United States will recognize Transjordan at the same time, which will be enough to eliminate the two countries' differences on Middle East issues and promote peace between Jews and Arabs. The outside world pointed out that the United States attaches importance to the interests of Jews in Palestine, and Britain supports the interests of Arabs. This can be answered by this move.

Although the results of this meeting remain secret, it is heard that both sides have made more progress in reaching an agreement than before. The same sources also said that Egypt has abandoned its original demand that Israeli troops must withdraw to the lines of October 14. In other words, Israel has given up Nitzana. On the other hand, the Jews are not forcing Egypt to withdraw from the Palestinian territory that it still occupies. It is heard that both sides are close to Bunche's proposal, which maintains the current occupation line and makes slight changes at certain points when necessary for military considerations.

### Far Eastern Commission Does Not Intend to Change Japanese Purge Regulations

US Expresses Surprise at Japanese Request

[United Press International, Washington, 22nd] According to well-informed sources, the Far Eastern Commission is satisfied with the handling of the purge of extreme nationalists in Japan. Therefore, the Far Eastern Commission has not considered changing the basic policy on the purge. Tokyo news reports said that Yoshida Shigeru's political movement recently requested relaxation of the purge regulations. It is said that even if Yoshida Shigeru's efforts to promote change receive some government sympathy, it will not affect existing measures, because this policy was decided by the Far Eastern Commission. Government officials expressed "surprise" at the Japanese request to relax the purge regulations. They said that compared with the purge of Nazis in Germany, the Japanese purge process is "the most gentle."

### Number of Overseas Chinese Entering Siam Has Not Exceeded Quota

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 21st] According to a Thai immigration official, since the Siamese government stipulated the total number of immigrants from all countries entering Siam on January 1, the number of Chinese people entering the country has not exceeded half of the quota, and most of them are in transit or traveling in Siam, staying here for no more than a month. Therefore, they cannot be considered newly arrived immigrants. The official also said that all Chinese who arrived in Siam without proper passports have been repatriated to China. Most of the Chinese entering the country come from Shantou and Hainan Island. Most of them are family members of overseas Chinese here. Because they were unaware of the new passport regulations announced by the government on December 31 of last year, they were detained by the Thai immigration authorities earlier this month.

### Rumors that Acheson Firmly Advocates Replacing US Military Commander in Germany, Pownall Succeeds as British Commander in Berlin

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st] There are rumors that Secretary of State Acheson firmly advocated to President Truman to replace the commander-in-chief of the US military in Germany. Today, the "Washington Star" reported that Truman may give this position to former Under Secretary of the Army Draper, and the current commander-in-chief, General Clay, will be ordered to return home next month. Some political circles here believe that Clay's return home can materialize the recent improvement in US-Soviet relations. Well-informed sources claim that President Truman has decided to eliminate military influence in the core of foreign policy. The decision to recall Clay can be seen as an indirect appeal to the Soviet Union, hoping that it will propose concrete conditions for a "peace offensive." However, the general opinion here is that the task of the US commander is extremely delicate, and Clay's successor will find it difficult to cope.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 21st] General Pownall, who succeeded General Herbert as commander of the British forces in Berlin, told reporters today that the policy of the British military government in Berlin will not change due to the change of commander.

This issue will be one of the main issues in the current trade negotiations. On the contrary, Japan hopes to purchase raw materials from French colonies.

### Two Professors Arrested at Jiaotong University: President Wang and Others Visited Them, Will Request Bail from the Police Department; One of the Five Arrested Students Still in Custody

### Nineteen Students in Custody Request Release; Special Criminal Court Orders Petition to Garrison Headquarters

[Our Report] Yesterday morning, presidents Zhang Yi, Xia Jianbai, Chu Fengyi, Ou Yuanhuai, etc., of twelve universities including Fudan, Tongji, Shanghai Law, and Great China, went to the City Hall to meet with Mayor Wu, hoping that the authorities would handle the case as soon as possible in accordance with the law, as the nineteen students detained in the Penglai Road Police Station for five months, who are currently on a hunger strike, have neither been prosecuted nor released. Mayor Wu promised to convey this intention to the detention authority and expedite the matter.

[Our Report] The nineteen students in custody previously submitted a petition to the Special Criminal Court requesting that they not be prosecuted and be released immediately.

### Resolution of Wage Dispute for Cigarette Piece Workers as Determined by the Social Affairs Bureau

[Our Report] Most of the piece workers in the city's cigarette industry are female, totaling about 50,000. Since last December, factories have gradually suspended operations and stopped paying wages, causing financial difficulties. They have repeatedly requested the authorities to mediate. The employers believe that piece workers have never been paid during shutdowns, so they refuse to pay. The workers insist on receiving living allowances. The case has now been adjudicated by the Joint Commission, with the main points of the solution being: (1) If the factory is still in a state of suspension and has not started work for a single day in January, the factory will subsidize each worker 50 cents per day, totaling 15 yuan for the whole month. (2) If the factory has been operating for 20 days or more in January, the workers will not receive any additional subsidies. If it is less than 20 days, the factory will subsidize the workers 50 cents per day for the remaining days, in addition to the wages actually earned for the working days. (3) The standard working time per day is nine hours. If it is less than nine hours, the factory will subsidize the workers five cents per hour. (4) If the worker's wage and subsidy income in January is less than 15 yuan, the factory will also pay the full 15 yuan. According to Director Shen of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, the main aim of the above measures is to guarantee the workers' minimum living standards.

### Military and Political Authorities Host Journalists to Affirm Determination to Ensure Public Security

[Our Report] Since the publication of the President's abdication announcement, the military and political authorities of this city have stated that the primary task of this city in the future is still to ensure public security first. Mayor Wu Guozhen and Garrison Commander Chen Daqing jointly hosted journalists in the City Hall conference room at 5 p.m. yesterday. Mayor Wu first delivered a speech, stating: After the President's abdication, Vice President Li has taken over. The peace talks issue is a major central plan, and peace or war must await the central government's decision. However, in this turbulent situation, local public security must be strengthened and maintained. The millions of citizens of this city pray for stability day and night. It is hoped that business and academic circles will work hard in their respective positions. If there are any actions outside the track that could disrupt public security, the authorities will handle them impartially in accordance with legal procedures. When labor disputes occur, the competent authorities should be asked to properly mediate. The government will severely punish any petty thieves or traitors who disrupt social order.

Commander Chen then made two points, briefly: (1) The responsibility of the Garrison Headquarters is to protect the people and maintain local public security. No matter what the environment or time, it will never easily relax its responsibilities. Anyone who undermines local public security will be severely punished. (2) Recently, there have been reports in the newspapers that the armed forces in Tianjin and Beiping have been disarmed and weapons have been laid down, which I find very painful. The military is responsible for maintaining public security. Unless they are discharged and return to their fields, they must stick to their posts and never relax their work and tasks. Therefore, disarmament is unimaginable.

### Liu Gongyun, New President of the National Bank, Takes Office

[Our Report] Mr. Liu Gongyun, President of the National Bank, took office at 10 a.m. yesterday. Mr. Liu was originally scheduled to take office tomorrow, but he moved it up temporarily because he was eager to go to Beijing on official business. The inauguration ceremony was very simple, and many guests came to congratulate him. First, former President Yu Hongjun convened the heads of the bank's various bureaus and departments and delivered a simple farewell speech, hoping that under the guidance of the new president, they would continue to work hard to serve. Then, Mr. Liu gave a speech, expressing his deep gratitude to the two presidents, Zhang and Yu, for their guidance over the past two years, and asking his colleagues to continue to assist him so that he could fulfill his responsibilities. After the speech, the new and old presidents exchanged seals and completed the handover. Mr. Liu also issued a written statement as follows: For the past two years, I have assisted Presidents Zhang and Yu, and I deeply feel that my talent and ability are limited and cannot help the current difficult times. I asked President Yu to forward my request to the central government to remove me from my position, but I was unexpectedly entrusted with an important task, which makes me extremely apprehensive. Now the central government is making every effort to promote the realization of peace, and the country's finances will gradually return to normal. During this period, I can only follow the government's financial policies, abide by the bank's established rules, and do my best to make up for any shortcomings and contribute to the national economy and people's livelihood. I sincerely hope that business and industry circles and people from all walks of life will not hesitate to correct me and grant me cooperation so that we can overcome the difficulties together. This is my great fortune.

### French Tramway Workers Briefly Strike; Resume Work After Persuasion; Wage Loan Issue to Be Mediated Again

[Our Report] On the 19th of this month, French tramway workers requested that the employer lend them half a month's salary, to be paid by the 25th, and to be repaid in four months starting in March. The Social Affairs Bureau did not accept the case because it was a wage loan issue, so labor and management negotiated on their own. The company believes that after the index rose on the 15th of this month, it has experienced serious difficulties in paying employees' original salaries and benefits, and expressed that it cannot raise the new expenses requested by the union. Upon hearing the news, the workers' emotions ran high, and they started a strike at 2 p.m. yesterday. All trams stopped running, and trolleybuses and buses also partially stopped. Upon hearing the news, Song, the chief of the Lujiawan Police Station, immediately persuaded them, and they resumed work at 4 p.m. The wage loan issue will be mediated again after Chief Song asks his superiors for instructions. However, after resuming work yesterday, all vehicles on each line returned to the factory early, and normal operations are expected to resume today.

### Postal Workers' Union Suggests Mail Exchange Between Kuomintang and Communist Areas, with Qingdao as the Mail Exchange Location

[Our Report] Since the war, transportation between the government-controlled areas and the communist-controlled areas has been difficult, and postal services have been cut off. People are separated from their loved ones, and they cannot communicate with each other, which is extremely painful. In view of this, the Municipal Postal Workers' Union issued a written statement yesterday by its Chairman Wang Zhenbai, urging the postal authorities to take effective measures to implement mail exchange between the two regions, and suggesting that Qingdao be temporarily used as the mail exchange location for both sides. The postal authorities attach great importance to this. The Union's statement is explored below: "Among the various freedoms enjoyed by people in countries all over the world, freedom of communication is perhaps the most basic and complete. Constitutions of various countries clearly stipulate that people have freedom of communication and should not be restricted unless absolutely necessary. This is because communication is essential for the development of human culture and the maintenance of emotions. From an international perspective, the contracting parties to the International Postal Convention include all countries in the world and their colonies. Since the convention was signed in Brussels in 1939, although the world situation has changed greatly, all contracting parties have been able to abide by it and have never violated it. Even for prisoners who have lost their personal freedom, it is expressly stipulated that they are allowed to send letters free of charge, which proves that people's freedom of communication has long been recognized by all countries in the world and cannot be cancelled for any reason.

China has had a postal service for 50 years. Although the country has suffered from continuous national crises and frequent wars, the postal service has always maintained its function and maintained postal communication in any situation. During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, letters between the rear and the occupied areas were unimpeded. Now, in the domestic war, people have been deprived of freedom of communication for several years, which is unprecedented in the history of China's postal service.

This association now wishes to urge the postal and transportation authorities to take effective measures to implement mail exchange between the Kuomintang and Communist areas in order to fulfill the postal service's obligations to the people. As for the technical aspects, this association believes that there are no major difficulties. The postal service has accumulated experience in this regard in the past. If the current war zone is vast, the positions of both sides are intertwined, and transportation is blocked, making it impossible to transfer letters, this association suggests that Qingdao be temporarily used as the mail exchange location for both sides, and special personnel be sent to set up an organization to handle postal communication matters. In the future, the scope will be gradually expanded to the whole country depending on the transportation situation. The members of this association are willing to support the realization of this plan from their respective positions."

### Trading White Powder and Gold at a Negotiated Price: Police Officers in Disguise Arrest Drug Traffickers; Rice Store Owner Turns Out to Be an Accomplice

[Our Report] Officer Zhou of the Criminal Division of the Jiangning Road Police Sub-bureau learned a few days ago that Quan Shengxiang, who lives at No. 11 Caojiazhai, Linsen West Road, and Chen Genxin (61 years old, Shanghainese, coppersmith, resident of No. 124 Yuguang Village, Yu Garden Road), had 20 taels of white powder (heroin) for sale, requiring 36 taels of gold to be traded. He reported the information to Chief Lin Deming. After Chief Lin managed to prepare the gold, he ordered Officer Zhou to disguise himself as a customer and contact Quan Shengxiang several times. They had agreed to meet at major dance halls and restaurants. Until about 10 a.m. on the 16th, the accomplice Wang Yong'an brought a package of white powder, together with Zhang Longhai (41 years old, local, runs a firewood business), to Chen Genxin's home, and then Chen delivered the goods to Quan's residence at No. 11 Caojiazhai, Linsen West Road, and agreed that the two parties would trade at the Shanghai New Village gas station on Shanzhong Road at about 1:30 p.m. that day. At that time, Chief Lin ordered police officers Xu Jintang, Qin Kairui, Wang Huaqiang, Zhu Bosen, Mu Hongqi, etc. to disguise themselves as rickshaw pullers and scavengers and ambush them around the gas station. He also ordered Officer Zhou to hold a bunch of gold and wait beside the gas station. Before long, Chen Genxin arrived alone, looked around and saw no one, then took out a package of white powder from his jacket and handed it to Officer Zhou, who also handed over the gold to him. Chief Lin gave a secret signal, and the ambushing police officers rushed forward and captured Chen. They then searched Chen's home on Yu Garden Road, but found nothing. They had no choice but to send additional police officers to stay on guard. At around 6 p.m., an accomplice Chen Pengfei (local, 38 years old, runs a rice store at No. 1749 Nanjing West Road) called Chen's residence to ask how the money was. The police officer replied that it had been received in full. Soon Chen arrived with Zhang Longhai and was arrested together. After interrogation, they confessed that the white powder was purchased from Wang Yong'an, who lived at No. 1261 Fanhuangdu Road. They immediately rushed to the address and arrested Wang. Wang confessed that the source of the white powder was from a supplier called "Little Wang." "Little Wang" currently lives near the milk shed on Old Street, Xujiahui, but no one by that name was found after searching the address. There were a total of six suspects in the case. Except for Quan Shenghao and "Little Wang," who are at large, the rest have been arrested. The people and stolen goods were sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for punishment at 4 p.m. yesterday.

### Concrete Measures for China's New Economic Policy (Continued from page 2)

(3) Transportation and Public Utilities

National transportation undertakings should actively be completed according to the specified trunk lines, and the principle of state-owned enterprises should be followed; however, the manufacture of transportation equipment can still be encouraged by international and domestic private investment. It is found that the promotion of international investment in various countries is mostly limited to certain areas, so as to avoid the disclosure of national defense secrets. National transportation undertakings are not suitable for private operation, nor can they be entrusted to foreigners. However, the manufacture of transportation equipment such as automobiles, ships, airplanes, and telecommunications equipment is not subject to this restriction.

Local transportation undertakings and public utilities should be operated by local governments in principle, and the method of official supervision and private operation may be adopted as appropriate when necessary. At present, there are some transportation undertakings and public utilities in various parts of China that are more successful under private operation than under public operation. However, this is a question of the strength of human, financial, and material resources. In principle, transportation and public utilities are related to the welfare of the local people and cannot be profit-oriented. Therefore, it is appropriate for the government to operate them publicly; however, the work efficiency of public undertakings in China is very low, so efforts should be made to improve them.

(4) Trade and Prices

Domestic trade should be carried out in coordination by consumer cooperatives and marketing cooperatives in principle. Among all kinds of private undertakings, commerce is the most chaotic and can harm society. The seriousness of the current price problem is actually caused by the poor commercial system. If consumer cooperatives can be widely established to supply daily necessities, and the government can approve the selling prices, the problems will be eliminated. Because consumer cooperatives are organized by consumers, they will never voluntarily raise prices to increase their burden, unlike merchants who aim at making profits everywhere. As for marketing cooperatives, since they are organized by producers, they may be willing to raise selling prices, but since the members are all farmers, they only seek to avoid intermediate exploitation, which can already increase their income a lot and avoid excessive demands.

The prices of the main items of the cooperative should be agreed upon by the government and the cooperative representatives, in order to strive for fairness and reasonableness. If the government must reduce the prices for some reason, the government will subsidize the cooperative. Private commerce should be limited to non-essential items approved by the government; all existing stores should be subject to a general inspection. Those that are not necessary to exist should be cancelled, and their employees can be transferred to consumer cooperatives and given appropriate jobs after training.

International trade should be operated by the government in principle, and every effort should be made to balance it. Imports are not allowed without the same amount of exports. If the needs of foreign cooperatives are produced and supplied by our cooperative, or if the needs of our cooperative are produced and supplied by foreign cooperatives, they may be directly handled by the cooperative with the special permission of the government. International trade is related to the balance of international payments and the management of foreign exchange, so it must be brought under state control. Cooperative international trade is more systematic and easier to control, and because the price system of cooperatives is different, the surplus can be distributed according to the transaction amount at the end of the year, which is beneficial to foreign exchange income. Therefore, it can be allowed to operate directly.

(5) Finance and Public Finance

The monetary system of the new economic policy should be set as a paper money standard, but a certain ratio of foreign exchange should still be maintained. The chaos of China's monetary system has reached the point where it seems that the value of the currency cannot be maintained without changing to real money or continuing to exchange gold. However, China does not have much gold and silver, and it can only be exchanged out and not recovered. How can it last? Moreover, since there is little gold in storage, the exchange cannot be done freely. Therefore, the high price and low currency value are still undeniable facts. Rather than not having the strength to cash out, it is better not to cash out. If price controls are effective, the real money standard is unnecessary. Under the standard, gold and silver are one kind of goods. However, in order to show the stability of the currency value, in addition to maintaining the stability of the basic prices of paper money, it is still appropriate to maintain the stability of gold and silver prices. In order to maintain the stability of gold and silver prices, in addition to maintaining a considerable amount of gold and silver bars, maintaining the official price of the whole bar, and not allowing retail sales, the government should mainly increase exports and reduce imports to replenish foreign exchange sources.

Banks should be state-owned in principle. Private banks with special histories and achievements that have been specially approved by the government may continue to operate. All others should be merged or revoked. In any country with a socialized economic system, banks are state-owned in principle, because banks are the main tool for implementing economic national policies; however, commercial banks have different goals and are difficult to control, so it is difficult to expect them to be able to implement the tasks of the new economic national policies.

Bank loans should be targeted at the implementation of socialized new economic policy plans. All those that are stipulated in the plans and can be used effectively should be fully granted loans. Today, China's financial policy does not have the cooperation of price controls, so if loans are not issued, it is feared that the economy will fall into stagnation; if loans are issued too much, it is feared that the money supply will be too loose and prices will rise, making the people in charge of the bank feel confused. This is also an important reason why China's economic construction has not achieved anything in recent years. In fact, as long as economic construction is planned and effective, and at the same time prices are controlled and taxation is serious, sufficient loans can be issued without so-called inflation.

Government revenue and expenditure and international payments must be balanced, and equal importance should be attached to increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. To balance international payments, the quantity that must be imported should be estimated, and then every effort should be made to raise exports of the same value. If it is impossible to raise enough, then the quantity of imports should be reduced again. As for the methods of reducing government revenue and expenditure, there are many commentators, and the key is to implement them, so I will not repeat them here. As for increasing revenue, as long as the business income tax, personal income tax, customs duties, and state-owned enterprises can be managed well, it will not be a problem. In the past, China's tax revenue was not effectively enforced on the wealthy, too many officials embezzled too much, and prices soared, so revenue could not keep up with expenditure. This was the main reason for the failure. If these three points can be effectively corrected with revolutionary means in the future, a balance can be achieved.

The government should establish public debt credit and issue high-interest short-term public bonds or gold public bonds to revitalize public finance. If price controls are effective, and at the same time private enterprises are restricted and private property income is restricted, then purchasing public bonds will become a normal way to use funds. Issuing gold public bonds is one way to recover gold. If it is feared that people are unwilling to purchase public bonds with gold, then the gold public bonds can be given the special right to low-interest mortgage loans. If it is feared that they cannot be cashed at maturity, they can be issued in a cycle, using the gold income from the new public bonds to repay the old public bonds, and the gold required for the bonds can be included in the export budget or the mortgage loans of the gold public bonds can be made primarily to increase the production of export goods. As long as there is sufficient foreign exchange, there is no need to worry about the inability to repay the gold public bonds.

### This Period's Cost of Living Index Will Not Be Announced in Advance

Regarding the issue of announcing the next period's cost of living index in advance, it was reported from Guangzhou a few days ago that the Cost of Living Index Review Committee would hold a meeting yesterday morning to discuss it. However, according to Mr. Chu Yifei, the director of the Municipal Government's Statistics Department, he told reporters that no meeting was held. The mayor has not yet approved the matter of announcing the index in advance. Therefore, the last price survey for this period will still be on the 28th (Lunar New Year's Eve). The cost of living index will be announced no earlier than the 29th, which is exactly the first day of the Lunar New Year. Therefore, factories, companies, and businesses may as well pay salaries according to the previous period's index first, and then make adjustments after the next period's index is announced.

### Careless Switchman Causes Accident on the Beijing-Shanghai Line; Train Collision at Kunshan Station Delays Many Passenger Trains

[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 22nd Dispatch] At 6:30 this morning, a special train heading from Changzhou to Nanxiang was stopped at Kunshan Station when a locomotive at the station was preparing to head over to add water. Unexpectedly, the track switch was mistakenly set, and it collided with the rear of the train. Although the damage to the carriages was slight, the damage to the track was quite severe. After active repairs, it was finally completed at 9:20 AM. All of the trains heading up the line were delayed by more than three hours.

[Report from this Newspaper] At 4:46 AM yesterday morning, a train collision occurred at Kunshan Station, damaging four freight cars, but fortunately there were no casualties among the passengers. The reason for this was that the fifth-fourth Shanghai-Beijing third and fourth class passenger train on the Beijing-Shanghai line arrived at Kunshan Station at 4:45 AM yesterday morning, and another temporary military train numbered 1189 was already stopped at the station. The switchman was careless for a moment and caused the fifth-fourth train to also enter the main track, resulting in a collision. The last four cars of train number 1189 derailed and were damaged. Fortunately, there was no one in the cars, so there were no casualties. The Railway Bureau immediately dispatched a rescue train to lift the damaged vehicles. By 9:15 AM, the main track was cleared, so the ninth and eleventh night express trains that did not go to Nanjing were blocked and could not come to Shanghai on time. At 10:20 AM, the Kunshan railway track was repaired, and the eleventh sleeper car arrived in Shanghai close to noon, with a total delay of three hours and forty-five minutes.

### Municipal Government Issues Additional Salaries and Allowances; Funds Appropriated

As for the matter of issuing an additional month's salary and allowances for January, the Municipal Government has repeatedly telegraphed the Executive Yuan for appropriation. However, with the Lunar New Year approaching, before the central government's funds have arrived, it has been decided that the Finance Bureau will temporarily prepare the funds, and it will be issued in two days, around the 26th and 27th of this month.

### Emergency Meeting of the Trade Union Federation; Discussing the Price of Rationed Rice; Considering the Next Period's Index; No Longer Insisting on Reduction

Regarding the authorities' increase in the price of rationed rice for workers, the Trade Union Federation petitioned Mayor Wu a few days ago. At that time, the mayor stated that the price adjustment could be postponed, but the compilation of the cost of living index for the second half of this month, regarding the rice item, must be calculated at 42 yuan per dou. In this way, workers should take into consideration the rate of increase in the relevant cost of living index. Therefore, the Trade Union Federation convened a second emergency council meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss this matter. Under the chairmanship of Zhou Xuexiang, the following resolutions were made: (1) If the price of rationed rice is maintained at the original number of 42 yuan, the next period's cost of living index will be greatly affected. In order to consider the next period's cost of living index, it was decided to abandon the original opinion (that is, to still follow the adjusted price of 95 yuan per dou). (2) The government can only adjust the price of rationed rice once a month. If there are several adjustments in a month, the right to this kind of rationed rice will be absolutely abandoned, and it is hoped that the Civil Affairs Committee will allocate rice to various rice shops as much as possible this period so that workers can purchase it. (3) Since Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau has been transferred to be the Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Social Affairs, due to his great help to workers in the past two years, it was resolved to petition the Municipal Government to retain him. After the meeting, Chairman Zhou Xuexiang led all the standing directors to the Municipal Government to meet with the mayor and report on the above three resolutions in detail.

### Police Station Director and Patrol Officer of the Water Police Bureau Indicted for Dereliction of Duty and Accepting Bribes

[Report from this Newspaper] The case of Shan Guohua, the director of the Suzhou River Branch of the Water Police Bureau, and Wang Baoqian, a patrol officer of the Beixingjing Police Station of the same branch, being accused of suspected corruption, was prosecuted by the District Procuratorate yesterday after investigation. On June 30, 1937, a sailboat caught fire near the Sanguan Bridge on the Suzhou River. After the Suzhou River Branch learned of this, it sent police to inspect the boat and found that the boat was carrying chemicals, film, banknotes, drawing paper, nickel ingots, and other items, so it was detained, and the boat crew was summoned for investigation. Later, Wang Baoqian, influenced by human sentiments, colluded with Shan Guohua, accepted bribes, and changed the case to a small boat emitting smoke, not a fire, and imposed a fine of 20,000 yuan according to the Violation of Police Regulations Act. They then bribed Dong Zipei, the clerk handling the case, with 20 million legal tender, and bribed police officer Fang Boying with another 18 million legal tender. Someone secretly reported this to the Third Bureau of the Presidential Office, which transferred it to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, which ordered the District Procuratorate to investigate.

### Most Parties Adopt a Wait-and-See Attitude; The Commodity Market is Generally Stable; The Issuance Date of Gold Bonds is Still to be Decided

[Report from this Newspaper] The reaction of the Shanghai market to the president's retirement was far less intense than expected. Financial commodities fell slightly at the opening, but then immediately rebounded, and the selling price was similar to the previous day's market. Cotton yarn prices were also very stable. Grain prices, on the other hand, rose. The trading price of white japonica rice in the market was 1,640 yuan per dan, an increase of 100 yuan compared to the previous day. Soybean oil and raw oil saw mixed rises and falls, but the changes were very small.

Industry insiders pointed out that the main reason why prices did not fall sharply was the lack of confidence in the currency value and the ambiguity of the CCP's response. Merchants are all adopting a wait-and-see attitude and dare not engage in large-scale transactions.

Another report: According to the person in charge of the Financial Management Bureau, the financial industry is currently fully prepared, and the head of funds is very abundant. No unexpected events will occur within the Lunar New Year. The bureau has also been closely monitoring in conjunction with relevant agencies to prevent fluctuations in prices.

Another report: The regulations for the issuance of gold bonds have been announced by the Executive Yuan and are scheduled to be officially issued on the first day of next month. However, there have been changes in the central situation, and as of now, this order has not yet reached the Central Bank. Whether it will be issued as scheduled can only be decided after Liu Gongyun, the new governor of the Central Bank, has gone to the capital to ask for instructions.

### Cargo Owners Continue to Raise Prices; Rice Sees Slight Increase; Flour, Bran, Oil, and Grain Markets to Close for the Holiday Starting Today

The rice market saw a slight increase. Because other commodity prices rose a lot the previous day, cargo owners continued to raise prices. However, because the prices reported from the producing areas were still stable, sales were still active. At the beginning, prices rose by 70-80 yuan, but in the middle of the market, due to more supply, prices were slightly weak. The closing price was 50-60 yuan higher than the previous day. The price of white japonica rice in the North Market opened at 1,720 yuan, an increase of 50 yuan. Thin indica rice and early indica rice rose by 100 yuan, and high-quality thin indica rice was 1,700 yuan. The price of white japonica rice in the South Rice Market rose by 60 yuan, and early thin indica rice rose by 50 yuan each. Although glutinous rice also rose slightly, sales were very sluggish. Yesterday, 6,327 stones of goods arrived in the two markets.

Flour: The market opened flat, but then, due to the rise in prices of commodities outside the industry, people's confidence strengthened, and prices also rose. However, yesterday was the last day of trading in the market before the Lunar New Year, so there were not many transactions. The opening price of Lao Che flour was 650 yuan, and then it opened at 675 yuan, an increase of 25 yuan. Bingchuan flour was 655 yuan, an increase of 33 yuan. Red Bee and Jiancheng increased more, rising 35-38 yuan each. Large bags of bran were 480 yuan, an increase of 26 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains: The market turned weak, especially for soybeans. Because the price of Hankou car beans rose too much the previous day, it retreated to 1,100 yuan yesterday, a decrease of 100 yuan. Jiujiang winter beans fell slightly by 20-30 yuan, Dudou was stable, and there were still many sales of corn, with prices down 50-60 yuan. Selected green high-quality goods did not open, and second-quality goods were 1,050 yuan. Red sorghum was slightly increased by 30-40 yuan. Sesame and raw peanuts were both flat and weak. Yesterday's transactions were few because it was the last day of the year.

Edible Oil: Prices rose first and then fell back, and finally saw a slight increase. In the early market, cargo owners raised prices because of the reported rise in prices outside the industry. Soybean oil opened at 7,800 yuan, but later, due to retail investors selling at high prices and factories also selling, prices fell. Soybean oil closed at 7,400 yuan, a slight increase of 100 yuan. Raw vegetable oil once reached a new price of 6,300 yuan, and closed at 5,900 yuan, an increase of 200 yuan. Jilong raw oil alone fell by 50 yuan because the original price was too high. Small car sesame oil closed at 6,600 yuan. There was a lot of supply and demand for soybean cake, and prices were stable.

Rice Industry Closed: As per usual practice at the end of the Lunar New Year, the food market is closed for the holiday. The markets for miscellaneous grains, flour, bran, and edible oil closed on the 22nd of this month, and the final settlement procedures will still be held on the 24th. The North and South rice markets will close on the 26th, and all grain markets are scheduled to open on February 2nd.

### Credit Slightly Tightens; Unofficial Interest Rates Rise Slightly

Credit in this city yesterday morning turned slightly tighter from easing. Unofficial interest rates in various industries rose slightly, averaging around 50 yuan. The rubber market was relatively strong and once reached over 60 fen. The sugar market was 45-50 yuan, and the cloth market was also high, once reaching 65 yuan. General borrowing was very difficult. It is heard that the reason for this is the influence of unstable news from several banks and merchants in recent days. Also, the state bank's rediscount and day-to-day interest rates remained unchanged yesterday morning.

### Banks and Money Shops Use Increased Capital in Cash

To be reviewed by the local Financial Management Bureau together with the Central Bank

[Report from this Newspaper] Regarding the increased capital in cash of various banks, money shops, and trust companies in Shanghai, when applying to use them for legal loans and legitimate purposes after they have been deposited, the Ministry of Finance has previously approved the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau to represent the ministry and handle the review together with the Central Bank. It is now learned that when banks and money shops in other places apply to use them, the Ministry of Finance has also approved the same procedure. If there is a Financial Management Bureau, the bureau will represent the Ministry of Finance and handle it jointly with the local branch of the Central Bank. If there is no Financial Management Bureau in the area, it will be reviewed by the National Bank or the bank entrusted to verify the capital, and then reported to the Ministry for record.

### To Meet the Demand for Cash at Year-End; The National Bank Will Issue More 100-Yuan Notes

In recent days, the shortage of cash chips in this city has reappeared, making transactions in the market very inconvenient. Regarding the rumor that the Central Bank will take this opportunity to formally issue 500-yuan notes, Mr. Chen Yanzuo, Deputy Director of the Issuing Bureau of the bank, officially denied it yesterday morning when he met with reporters from the United Credit Reporting Agency. Chen explained the reason for the current cash panic, saying: The Lunar New Year is approaching in an instant. Because various industrial and commercial institutions issue year-end bonuses, they need a large amount of cash. Moreover, ordinary citizens also need to reserve a certain amount of cash at the end of the year, which greatly reduces the cash circulating in the market. In addition to having already allocated a large amount of cash for emergency use within the day, the National Bank also plans to issue a new type of 100-yuan note printed by the Central Printing Factory in one or two days.

### Small Industrial Loan Review Meeting; Rescheduled for Tomorrow

Also, the Production and Export Business Loan Review Committee also held a meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon to review loan cases, totaling more than 30 cases.

### Export Limit Price Unchanged

### Tung Oil Transactions Stagnant

Recently, due to the approach of the Lunar New Year, the industry generally has no intention of accepting or transferring goods, and is in a state of cessation, resulting in a gradual stagnation of transactions and a calm process. In terms of price, the official price of fully measured white oil and genuine Xihong and the guild is 4,000 yuan. The remaining, such as secondary-grade Xihong and Qing oil, are also included in the normal track.

### Export of Edible Oil and Oil Materials

Must Be Released with Notification from the Export Promotion Department

According to the Jianghai Customs, regarding the export of soybeans, peanuts, sesame, rapeseed, and their squeezed oil, it should be verified and released with the official letter from the Export Promotion Department of the Export Control Committee to the Customs, which was previously notified in Bulletin No. 129. Also, the export of the above edible oil and its raw materials was temporarily suspended from August 27 of last year. The temporary management measures for the export of the above edible oil and oil materials were subsequently abolished, and bulletins No. 230 and 254 were issued successively to inform everyone. It is now ordered by the President's Tax Department that after the temporary management measures for the export of edible oil and oil materials are abolished, all exports of the above edible oil and oil materials must still be verified and released with the official letter from the Export Promotion Department of the Export Control Committee and the export exchange settlement certificate.

### Local Customers Turned Cautious; Cotton Yarn Trend Oscillates; Rumors of Profit-Taking Prevalent in the Downstream Cloth Market

The yarn market is showing an oscillating trend. As the Lunar New Year approaches, most local customers have temporarily stopped ordering goods, and actual sales on the local market have also decreased. Moreover, there is a feeling that the overall situation is about to change.

Both buyers and sellers are worried. However, because floating capital from local areas continues to pour in, credit is easy to loosen and difficult to tighten, and people's confidence is still boosted. As a result, most yarns have stayed at their original levels without moving.

The opening price of 42-count Blue Phoenix was at a low of 76,000 yuan, then it was raised to 83,000 yuan, and closed at 81,000 yuan, which was the same as before. The price of 40-count Blue Phoenix rose slightly by 15,000 yuan, ending at 76,500 yuan. The price of 32-count Silver Moon fell slightly by 500 yuan.

The spot price of 21-count Shuangma rose from 59,000 yuan to 61,000 yuan, and then fell back to 58,000 yuan at noon, with no rise or fall from the previous day. The factory price was 2,500 yuan lower, at 50,000 yuan, and the arbitrage for two days was 3,000 yuan. Prices of all grades of 20-count yarn have fallen, while prices of 16-count and lower grades have seen mixed rises and falls.

The cloth market turned weak. Credit within the industry is still loose, but because rumors of profit-taking are prevalent in the market, people are uneasy, and holders are continuously selling off. Local colleagues are still absorbing at low prices, but sales to customers are more sluggish. As a result, prices of all cloths have fallen by about 10%.

The quoted price of Longtou fine cloth is around 2,200 yuan, a slight decrease compared to before. The price of Laba Tong fine cloth was shouted up from 1,830 yuan to a maximum of 1,880 yuan, but fell back to 1,850 yuan at noon, a final drop of 300 yuan. The price of B Longtou fine cloth also fell by 300 yuan. The remaining Dongbao and Santao fine cloth were about 150 yuan lower each.

The opening price of Sijunzi plain serge was 1,950 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,900 yuan. Near noon, the price was shouted up again to 1,980 yuan, and the closing price was 1,970 yuan, a drop of 200 yuan. The price of Jinlian Miaowu plain serge and Leifengta plain serge were both 200 yuan lower. The price of Sijunzi plain direct serge fell by 160 yuan, ending at 2,160 yuan. Prices of the remaining cloths also followed downstream.

China Textile Sells Yarn

[Report from this Newspaper] China Textile Construction Company continued to sell yarn yesterday on behalf of the National Bank and the American Aid Association, but only 57 pieces were sold, with a value of 2,698,000 yuan. 11 pieces of 20-count Jin Shuangma were sold at 47,000 yuan each. 19 pieces of 20-count Hongrenzhong were sold at 48,000 yuan each. 27 pieces of 20-count Jinju were sold at 47,000 yuan each.

### Silk and Satin Consistently Continue to Weaken

The market for rayon yesterday was weak. Spot selling increased, credit within the industry tightened, and unofficial interest rates went from high to low. The willingness to sell in the market increased, and prices of all grades weakened.

The opening price of 120-count Tianqiao was shouted out as 85,000 yuan for one-week bills. Later, because the price of gold fell, and yarn and cloth prices fell, people's confidence turned from high to low, and the market once weakened, with low prices between 78,000 yuan and 79,000 yuan. After a short while, most of the credit was balanced, unofficial interest rates also fell, and the surface market replenished on dips, and the weakening trend rose again. However, because the end of the year is approaching and sales to customers are not moving, there is still a lack of improvement after the rally. At the close, there was still a lot of selling, and the quoted price tended to fall again, ending at 75,000 yuan. Prices of all grades fell across the board.

Because the market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates for raw silk is fixed, foreign sales are not moving, and the local market is weak due to the approach of the end of the year and the lack of easing of credit, and the willingness to buy is also weak. The superior grade of Lingdan continued the weakening trend of the previous day. The opening price in the morning was a low of 81,000 yuan. There were rumors that the price of gold had fallen again, and yarn, cloth, rayon, and satin all fell together. People's confidence was depressed and decadent, and the surface market was as still as water, with the shouted price falling by 3,000 yuan. Later, because credit eased, many orders that had not been discounted continued to be replenished on dips, and the trend improved slightly, but the overall trend was weak and struggling, and finally closed at 80,000 yuan, still a decrease of 10,000 yuan.

Yesterday, the market trend for silk and satin was oscillating and tortuous. The market trend was soft first and then oscillating, with uncertain ups and downs. The opening price of Meiya quilted fabrics in the morning was 50,500 yuan. Since spot selling from the previous day, buying interest in the market turned weak, and the market fell to 49,000 yuan. Afterwards, prices of yarn, cloth, and financial markets were suppressed, and foreign floating capital flowed out repeatedly, and after buying interest turned weak, it turned strong again, and the surface market started to pull up again, and the market turned into a better situation. Near noon, because credit tightened and then eased slightly, people's confidence continued to stabilize, and various groups added without end, and prices improved, and finally closed at 54,500 yuan, but compared with the previous day, the market still saw a pull-down.

### Tea Market: Ostensibly Stable, Underlying Strength

Yesterday, the tea market was even quieter than before, primarily because it was the weekend and dealers were generally waiting for the Lunar New Year's opening of the "red plate" trading. This resulted in supply not yet becoming smooth, and although buyers intended to absorb, they ultimately found it difficult to do so. Sellers also hesitated, so both inflows and outflows continued to be quiet, and transactions had little real substance. However, the underlying trend remained strong. In terms of prices, due to the exhaustion of high-end goods in stock, the current market is using goods of better quality to fill the gap, so there is no significant progress. Prices are ostensibly stable, with underlying strength.

### Basketball League Opens: China United Triumphs in First Match, St. John's Women's Team Loses to Li Team

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The fourth annual basketball league of this city kicked off last night. Three games started at 5:30 PM. The new facilities in the City Gymnasium's basketball hall were satisfactory, and the audience numbered over two thousand. The results of the games were: (1) Women's division: Li Team 34, St. John's 32; (2) Men's Division Two Group A: Donghua 34, Storm 29; (3) Men's Division One Group A: China United 63, Hai Qing 47. Looking at the three games, the Li Team's women's team was more willing to fight than St. John's. Storm's psychological state was abnormal, and they failed to perform to their full potential, ultimately being defeated by Donghua. China United was quite surprised at the beginning of their first game, but later gradually improved. Both veteran players and newcomers showed vigorous spirit. Although Hai Qing lost, their fighting style was clear and decisive, and they should not be underestimated. The game details are as follows:

Li Team Defeats St. John's (Women's Division)

The game between St. John's and the Li Team in the women's division kicked off this year's basketball league. With an electric scoreboard, St. John's maintained an advantage. After tying three times, the Li Team suddenly took the offensive, and the battle became fiercer. The red and green jerseys of the two teams were particularly distinct. In the first quarter, each team scored six points. The second quarter continued, and the Li Team was more successful. Their forward, Miss San, with her uniform pigtails, was beaming. Soon, they led 10-7. At halftime, the score was 16-11. In the third quarter, the score was 25-20, with St. John's trailing by five points. In the final quarter, St. John's Zhu Minlin and Jingyi quickly chased, and the difference was repeatedly only one point. In the last ten seconds, St. John's missed several shots, to the audience's regret. As a result, the score was 34-32, and the Li Team won. Among the team's forwards, Yao Silian was the most agile.

Donghua Defeats Storm (Men's Division Two Group A)

In Men's Division Two Group A, Donghua fought Storm. The latter once launched a fierce attack, but Donghua did not give way, and ultimately surpassed them with a score of 7-6. From then on, it was all their game. At halftime, Donghua scored 17 points, and Storm scored 11. The psychological state of the players was related to the outcome of the game. Donghua had fought on the field for a long time and "didn't take it seriously," while Storm, although young, lacked vitality, resulting in a significant gap. Donghua ultimately swept away Storm with a score of 34-29.

The opponents were Tao Huier, Taylor, Dickson, Lugen, and Luo Huiler. The initial score was 4-4. Youkesen exceeded by two points. China United did not dare to underestimate the enemy, and soon tied the score again at 9-9. Yellow-haired Taylor was a fast force, difficult to defend. At 11-10, China United's Zhang Liangxiong replaced Liu Fushan, and Le Jiazhou replaced Fu Jinsheng at 13-10. Luo Huiler was also quite fierce, making the score 15-10, which surprised China United. Dark-skinned Tao Huier, about seven feet tall, dominated the basket. At 21-16, Hai Qing replaced three players. Songyuan relied on free throws to score points, and Jiazhou scored a basket, gradually approaching. He and Zhenzhong each scored a goal, reversing the score to 23-21. Zhenzhong, Songyuan, and Xiao Le scored successively. At halftime, China United led with a score of 31-24.

At the start of the second half, Le, Wu, and Bao showed their power. The opponent's Darky and Dickson, Lugen, and others fought back. At five minutes, the score was 41-32. When China United reached 49-37, Zhenzhong, Jinsheng, and Hanting replaced the three forwards Wu, Liu, and Le. The two armies fought fiercely.

### Start of the Second Round of Football: Qingbai Defeats Qunli Team by a Large Margin; One-sided Situation at 4-1

The first scene of the second round of the Men's Division football league, Qingbai against Qunli, was performed in Yiyuan yesterday afternoon at 2:30, with a small audience of less than a thousand people. As a result, Qingbai won by a large margin of 4-1. Qunli passed the ball, and the attack was blocked. Qingbai's five forwards advanced. Xiao Luo in the middle passed to Liu Tiyin, who swayed the ball under his feet. Xiao Gu darted up and powerfully kicked at the ten-yard mark, and the ball went into the net in response, opening the scoring at one to zero. Qunli vowed to recover the lost ground. Lu Fangkui launched an uprising on the edge, picking towards the center. Yu Musen headed the ball, and Huang Shijie lightly stretched his arm, catching it right. Sun Huanwen's attack on the pass was also untamed. Qingbai revitalized the offensive. Xiao Luo's two shots did not score. At 28 minutes, Xue Peiran got Jin Lusheng's pass and tried the bull knife at the 20-yard mark, and it was a hit again, two to zero. After falling again, Qunli endured hardship and shared determination, united their efforts. Ruan Longsheng ran quickly along the edge, passing to the center on time. Meng Yiliang did not return to defend, and Yu Musen lightly pulled the ball at the ten-yard mark, pulling back a city. The first half ended at two to one.

During the second fight, Qunli's Tang Guoli replaced Sun Huanwen. Qingbai's Liu Tiyin and Xiao Gu exchanged positions, Zhang Renyi stepped down, and Qiang Yuanzhi took over. After initial contact, Chen Longquan got Yu Musen's assistance and broke into the goal, but Huang Shijie saved it. On the other side, Jin Lusheng cut in and shot fiercely, but was caught by Xi Boming. Not long after, Xiao Gu got the chance to cross, and Xi Boming rushed out. The ball went into Jin Lusheng's feet and steadily hit an empty goal. Sun Hanxing blocked the shot in the goal and turned it into a corner kick. At 13 minutes, Liu Tiyin went deep into the baseline along the edge and hooked the ball, which was headed by Lin Gui and hit the goalpost, bouncing out. Jin Lusheng came back again, and Lin Gui imitated his example, giving another head, the head blossomed, taking the lead at three to one. In an instant, Lin Gui cleverly passed Xiao Luo, who shot at the 20-yard mark, but Xi Boming was very careful and made no mistakes. At this time, Ruan Longsheng was injured and left the court for treatment. Qingbai's offensive was in full swing. Xiao Luo shot powerfully from 25 yards, with a beautiful posture, but unfortunately, it was a bit high and went over the bar. Qunli's new force Zhou Bingrong replaced Ruan Longsheng's vacancy, and Lin Shaojun moved forward. At 23 minutes, Liu Tiyin and Sun Hanxing clashed, and then resorted to force. Both were penalized by the referee. Not long before the end of the match, Qingbai still attacked continuously. Xiao Gu went deep into the enemy area and passed to the left. Xue Peiran stood out and added a foot to the net, again announcing a hit, ending the overall situation at four to one.

### Coin Disaster in Longshang

— Our reporter Song Lin

[Reported by our newspaper from Lanzhou on the 18th] Since "August 19th" increased the value of silver coins, people's lives in the past six months have indeed been like a muddy river. In Gansu, silver coins first secretly prevailed, and then openly stirred up trouble. In the past half month, they have almost been in full swing, trying to overturn the river and the sea. The various disasters caused by it have stirred up groups of people from all walks of life. The lower and middle-class people are swept into the vortex of the coin disaster, and there is almost a risk of capsizing at any time.

The Value of a H斗 Increased a Hundredfold

When the coins were changed on "August 19th," the black market price of silver coins in Gansu was around 5 million legal currency in Lanzhou (only 3 million in remote counties). At that time, the official raised its value to 6 million legal currency, but it also determined its fate, forever relegated to the cold palace, and unable to see the light of day again. Not long after, it was reborn under Minister Xu Keting, and the current value of a 斛斗 is 130 yuan in gold yuan coupons, which is equivalent to 390 million legal currency. "The value has increased a hundredfold" is no longer a descriptive term for it, but a true and accurate portrayal.

Scalpers Start to Move and Shift Their Targets

Recently, this silver tide started with deposit exchange. The handling bank issued 200 exchange certificates (note: each certificate is only allowed to exchange 49 silver dollars), and actually exchanged more than 50,000 silver dollars, making outsiders "monks of Zhang Er, unable to figure out the situation." In a very short period of time, the inventory was exhausted, and the public and teachers were foolishly lining up for a day to register, but as a result, the exchange was stopped the next day, leaving this group of salaried people happy for nothing. Seeing that they could not squeeze out silver dollars from the bank, the "scalpers" shifted their targets and sought a way out in outer counties.

Small Denominations are Extremely Scarce, and Large Denominations are Discounted

Originally, small denominations were extremely scarce in outer counties. When the deposit exchange was in progress, large denominations were discounted in the market of outer counties. A five-yuan gold yuan coupon could only be used as three one-yuan coupons. You could exchange a ten-yuan coupon for six or seven yuan of one-yuan coupons. As a result, small denominations of one yuan suddenly became popular. The scalpers in Lanzhou saw that there was a profit to be made, so they immediately spat out a large number of silver coins on the spot, squeezed back small denominations, and scattered to outer counties to exchange and speculate. As the coin wind spread, the silver coin black market was as turbulent as waves. The prices of daily necessities, which had always been based on the rise and fall of silver coins, were also messed up. For a time, the streets of Lanzhou could not see the beauty of the one-yuan gold yuan coupon, and the minimum purchase was five yuan or ten yuan, otherwise the seller would refuse customers thousands of miles away by saying "there is no way to give change." Some shops simply marked prices according to silver coins.

Longnan Postman Endures Hunger and Cold

In a small county in Longnan, two small stories happened: An early-shift postman in Longxi received his salary, all in five-yuan and ten-yuan denominations. He had to transport a batch of mail to another county. The director, fearing that the large denominations he received could not be used, gave him ten yuan in one-yuan stamps, so that he could sell them as small denominations along the way. Who knew that all the postal agencies along the way did not want to buy stamps with small denominations. The postman had no choice but to endure hunger and cold and struggle to the destination.

Insufficient Inventory, Refusal to Exchange Small Denominations

Another story: The county government of a county in Longnan once sent someone with about 1,000 yuan in large denominations to a bank in the county to exchange for one-yuan denominations, but the bank declined due to insufficient inventory. The county magistrate sent the finance section chief to negotiate, but it was still unsuccessful. The county magistrate was furious, and the bank director said that the inventory of small denominations could be checked in the accounts, and the bank did not use it privately. If the county government did not understand, he would resign and leave.

The Central Bank Tries to Ship in to Help

A week ago, the Central Bank had a chartered plane that brought more than 1.4 million yuan in one-yuan denominations. The bank, considering that the value of small denominations in circulation in the market was smaller than the value of being treated as a commodity, decided to fight the "scalpers" and used the branches of the Provincial Bank and the post office to distribute 1 million in banknotes to small counties within a hundred miles around Lanzhou to avoid being chased and swallowed by scalpers and becoming a tool for silver speculation. The remaining 400,000 yuan was used by the city's commerce and the Provincial Bank to agree on a reasonable distribution method to circulate in the city, so that there would be no difficulty in finding change in the market. However, the Provincial Bank, with extremely high interest rates, was unwilling to throw out a large sum of money to exchange small denominations. In addition, there was the problem of the cost of distributing to outer counties, which had not been resolved. It seems that if the shortage of small denominations is not resolved one day, the people who are deeply trapped in the coin disaster will not be able to catch their breath. Chairman Guo, concerned about the people's hardships, has repeatedly urged the Central Bank to quickly find a way to ship in to help.

### Cooperating with Construction and Strengthening Production: Gansu's Cooperative Undertaking Has a "Leap Forward" Trend

Gansu's cooperative undertaking is considered to be a more developed province in the country. This is due to the rich special products and underdeveloped transportation in Gansu Province. However, human factors cannot be ignored. For example, the enthusiasm of local people and the wise advocacy of Chairman Guo Jilu have made the progress of Gansu's cooperative undertaking have a "leap forward" trend.

The scope of work of the cooperative undertaking is divided into four items: organization, business, finance, and education. Organization, finance, and education are used as a means to develop work, and business development is used to promote construction. In terms of business, the total value of agricultural cooperative production is more than 860,000 yuan, the total value of industrial cooperative production is more than 320,000 yuan, the total value of consumer cooperation is more than 39,000 yuan, animal husbandry cooperation has more than 30,000 breeding sheep, small-scale water conservancy benefits more than 120,000 mu of farmland, and land improvement (sand paving) benefits more than 20,000 mu of farmland. The emerging sugar beet sugar industry has established 37 cooperatives and planted more than 3,000 mu of sugar beets. Cotton production cooperatives planted more than 56,000 mu, producing more than 575,000 jin of cotton. In addition, a total of 167 cooperatives for military, government, and teachers have been formed, and the total value of special product transportation and sales cooperation is more than 87,000 yuan. In terms of cooperative finance: Since July last year, the loan was stopped on August 19, which greatly affected the cooperative undertaking. The cooperatives launched a share increase movement last year, and the total amount of shares in cooperatives in the province has reached more than 7 million yuan, and the total amount of shares in each treasury has reached 310,000 yuan. In terms of cooperative education: A total of 110,000 cooperative personnel were trained last year. The current difficulties encountered by the agricultural and industrial business of the Gansu cooperative undertaking are price fluctuations and lack of funds. Cooperative cadres also feel insufficient due to the increasing expansion of the undertaking. Therefore, the Gansu Cooperative Management Office has formulated this year's work plan, which will focus on the production of agriculture and industry in terms of business. Agricultural production, such as the increased production of rice, wheat, tobacco, medicinal materials, hemp, cotton, etc., will also focus on afforestation, odd animal husbandry, small-scale water conservancy, agricultural paving sand, sugar beet sugar, etc. Industrial production will continue to promote sheep hand standardization, variety improvement, and the promotion of hemp and wool weaving. In addition, textile, leather, oil extraction, paper making, and simple chemical production will also be closely coordinated with the Northwest Wool Improvement Team, the Northwest Animal Epidemic Prevention Team, and the Gansu Chemical Plant to gradually advance. Strengthening Construction In terms of finance, this year will establish a "cooperative accounting system," implement cooperative loans, tentatively set at 70 million yuan, try to increase the cooperative funds at all levels by 200,000 yuan, increase the subscription of treasury capital by 50,000 yuan, and train cooperative personnel as much as possible. Hold short-term cooperative workshops in various counties.

Gansu Province is barren and the people are poor, and most materials rely on foreign countries. Therefore, to build a new Gansu, we must first strengthen the promotion of construction undertakings, such as developing transportation, expanding water conservancy, and increasing production, so as to achieve a self-sufficient state, the so-called "make the best use of the land and the best use of people."

### Food Shortage in Guizhou Province: Gu Zheng Lun Cables the Pacification Headquarters to Appeal

[Our Chongqing, 21st Dispatch] Guizhou Province Chairman Gu Zheng Lun, regarding the food shortage in Guizhou province, recently sent a long telegram to the Pacification Headquarters to appeal, stating: "Since the price controls were lifted, the price of salt has increased fifty-threefold within a hundred days. The price of salt announced by Hai Dong, the warehouse price in Guiyang, is 578.78 yuan per dan (unit of weight), and it will certainly be more than that in the outer counties. Guizhou province sells 110,000 zu (ancient monetary unit) of salt per month, which means the purchase price for one month requires more than 60 million gold yuan. At that time, the amount of gold certificates issued in Guizhou province, according to the Central Bank's report, was less than half of this amount. Even if the entire amount issued in the province is used as money, it is still not enough to buy half of the required salt. Not only will the people of Guizhou have to eat bland food, but the salt stored in the warehouses cannot be sold. If the transporters cannot sell their goods, they will not have the capital to go to the fields to buy more. Therefore, in a desperate situation, the Salt Bureau will allow the total amount of salt allocated to various counties before December of the 37th year of the Republic of China (1948) to be purchased and transported as quickly as possible within one month at the fixed price of 33.77 yuan per dan, excluding national taxes, plus interest of 60.43%. Any amounts not purchased after this period will not be re-allocated. This is only a temporary measure to maintain public morale. If the Salt Bureau sets the price, the people will not have the means to purchase and transport the salt. To solve this problem, there is no other way than to obtain loans from the National Bank. According to the Guizhou Salt Bureau's report, there are a total of 17 transporters. The amount transported in the 37th year was 815 loads and 230 (units), but to date, only 2 loads have been transported to the warehouses. The previous salt prices have never been reduced, and the slow transportation of salt is purely due to collusion between officials and merchants. We have telegraphed the central government to request a thorough resolution."

### Wuxi Public and Private Organizations Held a Representative Meeting Yesterday

Discussing Ways to Strengthen Defense

[Our Wuxi, 22nd Dispatch] The Joint Association of People's Public and Private Organizations held a joint meeting of executive committee members and representatives this afternoon. Chairman Qian Sunqing presided over the meeting.

### Responsible Politics in Hangzhou

— Our Reporter Huang Xing Tian

[Our Hangzhou, 18th Dispatch] On the fiftieth day of Ren Xianqun's tenure as the mayor of Hangzhou, succeeding Zhou Xiangxian, he submitted a memorandum to the first municipal council meeting held during his term. The memorandum listed eight items related to the construction of Hangzhou, which are planned to be completed between January and March of the 38th year of the Republic of China (1949). If 60% of these items are not completed by the deadline, Ren Xianqun declared that he would resign in early April to apologize to the citizens. The heads of each department will also bear responsibility. This memorandum was not only stamped with the municipal government's seal but also with Mayor Ren's personal seal. Ren presented the memorandum to all municipal councilors during the council meeting as a sign of sincerity.

Promissory Note

It is common for government leaders to issue "promissory notes," whether "bounced" or not, but it is rare for Ren Xianqun to personally present a memorandum to the council as a "promissory note." According to Ren's own explanation, this is based on his consistent advocacy and practice of "responsible politics." At the beginning of his tenure, Ren told reporters that he did not want to be an official but wanted to do things. Therefore, when he took office as the mayor of Hangzhou, he did not want to be an ordinary administrative official but to handle administration with the attitude of running a business, doing something for the citizens of Hangzhou. A newspaper in Hangzhou mistakenly reported that he would handle administration with the attitude of running a business. Ren specifically explained to reporters: "I particularly value running a business because administration can be perfunctory, while running a business requires responsibility. For example, Director Hou Jiayuan of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway cannot delay building the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway; he must complete it. If he delays and fails to complete it, in other words, if he cannot take responsibility, he must leave. It is the same for me as the mayor of Hangzhou. If I cannot do things, I will get out." His words were both straightforward and firm.

Two Principles

Ren Xianqun had no specific plans when he took office. He said: "It depends on the objective conditions, but I have two major principles: that I must serve the majority of citizens and that I must grasp the key points and do things practically." Later, in his policy report to the municipal council on January 17th, he further stated: "To serve the majority of citizens, the government's policies must seek the interests of the majority of citizens, alleviate or reduce the suffering of the majority of citizens, and use surpluses to make up for deficiencies, with the goal of implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood in its policies." Therefore, he wants to ensure that farmers in the city have their own land and that empty houses in the urban area are rented out so that everyone can live and work in peace. At the same time, he will slightly restrict the interests of a small number of privileged classes so that the lives of citizens can achieve a more equal status.

First Two Moves

Therefore, after taking office, Ren Xianqun, having taken over all the anemic and almost paralyzed institutions of the municipal government, first changed the style of his predecessors, no longer welcoming dignitaries at the train station or feasting at the Louwailou Restaurant. At the same time, he slightly adjusted the organization and rectified the ranks according to actual needs. In his work, from the beginning of his tenure, he showed a hard-working, pragmatic, and decisive style. In order to lay the foundation for running the city and increase the municipal government's income, he first took aim at unscrupulous merchants, raising the business tax rate (not the tax rate itself) twenty times. This was a surprising move, and many people said: Mayor Ren's first move will probably fail, but in the end, although he offended the business tycoons, he succeeded. His surprising second move was directed at tax collectors. In Hangzhou, among the field staff of the Tax Collection Bureau, there were reportedly so-called "Four King Kongs" and "Thirteen Taibaos," which were, of course, stains on the tax administration. After receiving the report, Ren immediately summoned everyone for a lecture and set a deadline of two weeks to name the "Four King Kongs" and "Thirteen Taibaos." If the deadline was not met, all of them would be dismissed. As a result, fourteen days passed quickly, and the "King Kongs" and "Taibaos" were still nowhere to be found. Therefore, decisively, he dismissed all the field staff. From these two events, one can imagine Ren's administrative style. Although some councilors publicly said that he was "hard-headed," and some business tycoons publicly scolded him and told him to get out, it was precisely because of his decisive reorganization of tax collection and purification of officialdom that the municipal finances could have a slight foundation, no longer running a series of deficits, and the public school staff and teachers' rice rations and salaries could be paid on time, allowing construction projects to be gradually launched.

Eight Public Affairs Items

How will Ren gradually launch his construction projects? Based on the principles of serving the majority of citizens and being down-to-earth, his first promissory note consists of the following eight items:

(1) Based on Hangzhou's geographical environment and the needs of its citizens, to complete the design of a modern urban construction plan by the end of March as a goal for the joint efforts of the government and citizens in the future.

(2) To strengthen one municipal middle school, one municipal primary school, and sixteen central national schools, ensuring that the equipment, such as books and instruments, fully meets the standards stipulated by the Ministry of Education.

(3) To increase tap water usage by 8,800 households, with the installation standard prioritizing poor households and areas with the highest water consumption but lacking sufficient tap water.

(4) To renovate twenty-four streets and alleys, with the order of priority determined by the district offices.

(5) To add night soil removal vehicles to eliminate street-side night soil carriers.

(6) To add garbage trucks and designated garbage stations to remove accumulated waste and improve environmental sanitation.

(7) To design a method of using garbage to manufacture fertilizer, starting shipments by the end of March.

(8) To plant three million trees to conserve water and cultivate the scenery.

In Line with Principles

From this plan, it can be seen that it is in line with Ren's two major principles: serving the majority of citizens and being down-to-earth. A reporter heard several Hangzhou residents say: "Let alone renovating twenty-four streets, as long as one stinky alley like Pishi Alley is renovated, we are willing to build a merit arch for Mayor Ren." This shows how dissatisfied the citizens of Hangzhou are with the current situation of Hangzhou, especially with the substandard small streets, alleys, sewers, and water supply. During Mayor Zhou's tenure, it was said that there were only "three roads and one West Lake," neglecting the small alleys and streets within the city. Since the establishment of the water company, it has never increased the number of water users. Therefore, when Ren Xianqun took office, many people hoped that he would not be a West Lake mayor but could truly be a Hangzhou mayor. Now, Ren has finally lived up to expectations, putting the construction of Hangzhou in front of the construction of West Lake, and putting doing things in front of being an official.

Commendable Points

There are two other commendable points about Ren's responsible politics: one is that he can broadly solicit public opinion, and the other is that he can resolve issues immediately. Everyone knows that Ren likes to dance and have fun, but this is his "American style." He is completely different when he is in the office. Not only is his office like this, but he also has the longest office hours. Even if something happens in the evening, he can work until three or four in the morning to quickly resolve it. The handling of refugee students and the酝酿ed large-scale strike of 8,000 people at the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau were both resolved quickly because of his ability to act quickly, thus maintaining the stability of Hangzhou. Ren's new trick is to add a citizen reception room to the municipal government. This year, he will also hold "public opinion surveys" and "mailbox in the air" to establish extensive contact with the broad masses of citizens and adopt public opinions from them. Recently, in order to decide what kind of city Hangzhou should be built into, he also publicly solicited opinions so that he can base his decisions on the opinions of the citizens.

Where to Settle

What kind of city should Hangzhou be built into? Our newspaper has also published articles on this topic, with the main theme being to focus on culture. At this time, it seems empty to talk about such a plan, but with Ren's down-to-earth style, we sincerely hope that Ren can practically seek welfare for the citizens of Hangzhou, and also use the same spirit and effort to build Hangzhou into a spiritual home and cultural center for the people of the whole country.
