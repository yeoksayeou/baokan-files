### Possible Overthrow of the Political Yuan Organization Law, Formation of New Cabinet May Be Delayed, Lu Zuofu to Head Communications While Concurrently Serving as Minister of Defense, Xu Kan to Remain as Finance Minister, Candidates for Deputy Yuan Chief Still Being Recruited

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The selection of members for He Yingqin's new cabinet is proceeding step by step. Lu Zuofu has been invited to serve as Minister of Communications, He Yingqin himself will concurrently serve as Minister of Defense, and Xu Kan will continue as Minister of Finance. However, as of the evening of the 17th, responses from both Lu Zuofu and Fu Bingchang, the intended Minister of Foreign Affairs, had not arrived in Nanjing. Meanwhile, Dr. Wu Yifang declined to join the cabinet on the 17th. Currently, only the Ministries of Judicial Administration, Interior, and Defense have been decided; the remaining five ministries and two committees have yet to be determined. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, in particular, with its extensive powers, is significantly impacting the selection of candidates. News circulated on the evening of the 17th that Legislative Yuan members might propose a review of the Ministry of Economic Affairs issue. If so, the formation of the new cabinet will evidently be further delayed. He Yingqin spent the entire day of the 17th receiving guests at his official residence, with Chen Cheng, Wang Lingji, Zhu Shaoliang, Yang Sen, and others visiting him one after another. Some individuals expressed their pleasure at Chen Cheng's visit to Nanjing during the cabinet formation period, believing it would aid in the cabinet's preparatory work.

[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] Premier He Yingqin continued discussions with senior Kuomintang figures on the 17th regarding the formation of the cabinet. The new cabinet is expected to be formed early next week. According to sources close to He Yingqin, the progress of the cabinet formation as of dusk on the 17th is as follows: (1) Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, and Wu Zhongxin are internally designated as Ministers Without Portfolio, (2) Wu Tiecheng continues to firmly decline to join the cabinet, (3) Premier He invited Xue Dubi to serve as Deputy Premier. Xue has not accepted, (4) Huang Shaohong was invited to serve as Secretary-General; Huang has not accepted, (5) Ni Jiongcheng will still serve as Deputy Secretary-General, (6) Fu Bingchang and several other individuals were mentioned for the position of Foreign Minister, but Premier He has not formally invited Fu to take on the post, (7) Premier He intends to concurrently serve as Minister of Defense, (8) Xu Kan was internally designated as Finance Minister, but due to opposition from the Control Yuan, another candidate might eventually be chosen, (9) Lu Zuofu was invited to serve as Minister of Communications. Lu has not accepted, (10) Zhang Shijian accepted the position of Minister of Judicial Administration, (11) Wu Yifang declined to serve as Minister of Education, and other candidates are being considered, and (12) Dai Kuisheng will continue as Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission.

[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] He Yingqin had to change his cabinet formation plans on the 17th because the Legislative Yuan refused to reconsider its decision to reduce the number of ministries and commissions. According to sources close to the Executive Yuan, the bill to reduce the number of cabinet ministries by ten will delay He's efforts to complete cabinet formation. He Yingqin and Acting President Li Zongren attempted to persuade the Legislative Yuan to reconsider their actions on the 16th. Li Zongren summoned twenty-two Legislative Yuan members, including Chen Guyuan, to his official residence on the night of the 16th, but failed to convince them that abolishing or amending the bill, which had already passed its third reading, was appropriate. It is understood that although Chen Guyuan expressed sympathy for the government's position, he believed that the necessary procedures for reconsidering the bill were "too complicated" and therefore refused to take action. Whether the President and Premier will further persuade the Legislative Yuan to revise its decision remains uncertain. If He Yingqin accepts the newly decided bill, he can invite non-Kuomintang figures into the cabinet by giving them positions as ministers without portfolio, thus realizing his original plan.

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 17th] Zhang Qun stated that he would return to Chongqing in a day or two. He received a phone call from He Yingqin on the night of the 16th, who instructed him to persuade Wu Tiecheng to accept the position of Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan.

[Central News Agency, this city] Reports indicate that Zhang Shijian will join He's cabinet as Minister of Judicial Administration. Sources informed our reporter that "Premier He personally invited Zhang to join the cabinet when he was in Shanghai a few days ago. On the evening before last (the 16th), Premier He again spoke to Zhang by long-distance telephone, requesting him to serve as Minister of Judicial Administration. Zhang politely declined both times, only agreeing to assist from the sidelines without holding an official title. The report that Zhang has agreed to join the cabinet is not factual."

[Central News Agency, this city] The Democratic Socialist Party is scheduled to convene a Central Standing Committee meeting today to discuss Premier He Yingqin's invitation to join the cabinet.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th] Xu Fulin, Deputy Chairman of the Chinese Democratic Socialist Party, has not finished his affairs in Guangzhou and will change his plans to fly to Shanghai and then to Nanjing on the 19th.

### Legislative and Control Yuan Members Advise Premier He That Leaders Should Be Selected Based on Merit, Legislative Yuan Members Propose Four Standards Hoping to Live Up to Popular Expectations, Control Yuan Scheduled to Host He Yingqin This Afternoon

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] A group of Legislative Yuan members, including Liu Xiwu and eighteen others, recently jointly sent a letter to Premier He of the Executive Yuan, solemnly proposing four standards for the selection of new cabinet members, hoping to select talented and capable individuals who will live up to popular expectations. The original letter states: "This time, as you take on the premiership, you face extraordinary times and bear a difficult responsibility. Your commitment to rectifying the situation is highly admirable. Today, the key to the nation's survival lies in promoting peace and reforming politics. To achieve this mission, the only way is to obtain the right people. If personnel are not properly selected, all policies will be empty words. With your insight, you surely understand this deeply and have planned it thoroughly. We agree to your forming the cabinet and hope that you will select talented and capable individuals who will live up to popular expectations. We humbly submit the following standards for the selection of cabinet members for your consideration." Attached are the standards for the selection of cabinet members: "(1) Carefully select honest, capable, progressive, and promising personnel, and do not allow corrupt, incompetent, or opportunistic individuals to enter the cabinet. (2) Carefully select personnel who can handle difficult tasks and work diligently, and do not worship idols, forcefully bring in the declining and mediocre, or corrupt officials into the cabinet. (3) Carefully select personnel who are impartial, serve the country, and serve the people, and do not appoint individuals solely for factional interests or to benefit the wealthy. (4) Those who have served as cabinet members for a long time or have held important military and political positions without showing any achievements, or those who have become wealthy through their military and political service, should not be included in the cabinet."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The entire membership of the Control Yuan is scheduled to hold a tea party at the International Association at 3:00 PM on the 18th to host Premier He Yingqin and provide opinions on issues such as the He cabinet's policy guidelines and personnel matters.

### The Peace Agreement Was Destroyed by the Chinese Communists

[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] Well-informed sources say that an official is now studying the Chinese Communist implementation of the thirteen articles of the local peace in Beiping, believing that the Chinese Communists have actually completely destroyed the Beiping peace agreement signed a month ago. These officials are now closely watching the daily broadcasts of the Chinese Communists, waiting for Mao Zedong's permission to start peace talks, but are increasingly anxious about the future. An official said: If the implementation of the Beiping agreement is considered the Chinese Communists' style of dealing with future solutions, the hope for China's permanent peace seems very slim. He pointed out that the most obvious destruction of the Beiping agreement by the Chinese Communists was the prohibition of the circulation of gold yuan notes and the cessation of the publication of some newspapers, which "obviously does not comply with the thirteen articles of the agreement."

### Legislative Yuan to Hold Sixth Meeting Today to Discuss Public Education Compensation Case, Military Reorganization Plan Also on the Agenda

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The sixth meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the 18th to discuss a total of four cases: (1) Consulting the President to legally declare the end of the period of mobilization and suppression of rebellion, and immediately cease the application of the temporary provisions of the period of mobilization and suppression of rebellion. (2) The compensation of national public education personnel should be rationally adjusted as soon as possible. (3) Organize gold price deposits, stabilize finance, improve salary methods, protect savings, and unite the hearts of soldiers and civilians. (4) Please ask the government to quickly set a military reorganization plan, reduce the number of troops, tighten expenditures, verify the payment of salaries, and reduce non-combat personnel as much as possible to save national funds.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Amidst the active promotion of military reforms by Acting President Li and Premier He, Legislative Yuan members Wang Guangqing and forty-five others have recently proposed a resolution requesting the government to quickly set a military reorganization plan, reduce the number of troops, tighten expenditures, verify the payment of salaries, and reduce non-combat personnel as much as possible to save national funds, which has been included in the agenda of the Yuan meeting on the 18th. The method of this case is to ask the Executive Yuan to quickly convene a military reorganization meeting, formulate a reorganization plan, reduce the army, verify the payment of salaries, and ensure that the income of officers and soldiers is sufficient to maintain their livelihoods. The number of officers and soldiers is temporarily limited to 2.5 million, and other non-combat personnel and all unnecessary extravagant expenditures should also be reduced as much as possible. In the reasons for the proposal, the current expenditures of the National Army were listed, stating: It is found that the existing National Army is said to have 4.2 million officers and soldiers. Excluding the salaries of 150,000 people in Taiwan, the expenditures are calculated according to March of this year as follows: (1) Salary of silver dollars 19,272,476 yuan, calculated at the high price of silver dollars in early March, 3,300 gold yuan notes, equivalent to 63,599,170,800 gold yuan notes. (2) Supplementary cost of silver dollars 5 million yuan, equivalent to 16.5 billion gold yuan notes. (3) Public miscellaneous expenses of silver dollars 2,781,000 yuan, equivalent to 9.1773 billion gold yuan notes. (4) Business expenses are about 9.5 billion gold yuan notes. (5) Other emergency items are about 6.1 billion gold yuan notes. According to this number, the annual salaries of officers and soldiers require 12,585.176496 billion gold yuan notes. In the future, prices will continue to soar, and the number will increase many times. In addition, there are major items such as clothing, military fire, aircraft fuel, and military glutinous rice, which are said to be nearly 200 billion yuan per day, and 2 trillion yuan per year. If prices rise again, the increase can be inferred by analogy. At a time when the people's strength is depleted, tax sources are exhausted, and the national treasury revenue is sharply reduced, if a military reorganization plan is not determined and reductions are not made, the treasury will become empty day by day, and the economy will inevitably go bankrupt. Moreover, there are too many officers and soldiers, it is not easy to increase their compensation, their lives are uneasy, discipline is lost, the military's reputation is in danger, and the national treasury is wasted. Now the Yuan advocates simplifying institutions and implementing austerity policies. The largest expenditure of the National Army should be proposed to be reduced first. Moreover, it is found that the organization of military institutions is huge, and those who control materials arbitrarily embezzle them. Non-combat personnel spend most of the military expenses, and the soldiers in the front cannot eat their fill, the military is scattered, morale is low, the people raise troops with their blood and sweat, and the more soldiers there are, the more they harm the people, and the more officials there are, the more they harm the people. Complaints and grievances, loss of combat power, the plan to reorganize the army, how can it be delayed?

### Bai Chongxi Returns to Hankou, Zhang Zhen Pays a Visit to Report on the Situation in Henan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Bai Chongxi left Nanjing on the Tianxiong special plane at 11:00 AM on the 17th.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 17th] Bai Chongxi flew back to Hankou at 1:45 PM on the 17th. Xia Wei, Chairman of Anhui, and others came with him. Zhang Zhen, Chairman of Henan, paid a visit to Bai at 3:00 PM in the afternoon and reported in detail on the development of the situation in southern Henan.

### Air Force Sinks Huang'an Warship, Chongqing Still Anchored in Bohai Sea

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 17th] Regarding the Huang'an warship that fled on February 12, according to confirmed information, the ship has been sunk by the Qingdao Air Force inside the port of Lianyungang. It is reported that the ship was one of the eight ships compensated to our country by Japan, about 3,000 tons, and its weapons were not fully equipped. It was once incorporated into the First Fleet of the Navy. On the evening of February 12, it was anchored at Pier 6 of Qingdao Dagang. That night, its captain was staying at a private residence on the shore, and it was secretly opened by his subordinates and fled to the Communist army. The Communist Party radio station used it as propaganda material.

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 17th] After the Huang'an warship fled and disappeared, the headquarters of the Second Naval District here received intelligence from various sources reporting the whereabouts of the ship. The naval base sent two ships, Taiping (Captain Jiang Qian) and Gu'an (Captain An Guoqiang), to search the sea. At that time, there was no air force assistance for some reason. Subsequently, after the results obtained from land intelligence and air force reconnaissance, it was confirmed that the ship had arrived inside the port of Lianyungang, and the personnel on board had landed and gathered in the former Salt Affairs Bureau in the city. After detailed research by the authorities, it was decided to send the Air Force to observe and bomb the ship with personnel from the naval base. Because the ship was a Japanese receiving ship, it had not been equipped and had no resistance. The ship was completely hit and sunk in the last bombing at noon on the 15th. From the 13th to the 15th, the Air Force dispatched once or many times every day, with more than five aircraft each time. Tonight, the reporter fully confirmed this matter from the responsible party of the Navy here. However, the responsible person only announced the date and location of the ship's sinking due to other reasons, and refused to disclose the exact number and list of people on board. Also, after the Huang'an warship was sunk, there was an interesting misunderstanding. One party reported that the Huang'an had not fled and was still in Jiaozhou Bay, currently shipping military supplies to Zhucha Island. Upon learning of this, I was quite surprised and immediately found out that it was the Huang'an, a merchant ship with the same name, not the Huang'an warship. There were many episodes caused by inaccurate information, and this was one of them.

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 17th] According to reliable information, the Chongqing warship is still on the Bohai Sea. The Air Force has dispatched many times to bomb it, and the ship resisted with fierce anti-aircraft fire. Another most reliable source said that the ship did not go to Dalian. When the Air Force here flew over the Bohai Sea, it encountered Soviet aircraft groups taking off from Lushun and Dalian. It is believed that Lushun and Dalian have excellent radar equipment, and the Chongqing can be replenished in many ports in the Bohai Sea.

### Chinese Communists Designate Five Banks to Handle Foreign Exchange Business

Other banks, agencies, merchants, and people are not allowed to handle this business without authorization.

### People in the Henan-Hubei Border Area Resist Land Reform Struggles, Gather Tens of Thousands of People to Annihilate Local Communists

### News from Yizheng, An Isolated City in Jiangbei, Gunfire at Night is a Common Adornment of Life, High Prices, Military Grain and People's Food Become a Problem

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 17th] The reporter accepted the invitation of Zuo Zhi ren, the magistrate of Yizheng County, and made a special trip to the city, returning to Zhenjiang on the 17th. What the reporter saw and heard in the 24 hours he spent in this isolated city in Jiangbei was that the difficulties encountered in life were far greater than the pain given to the local government and the military and civilians by the tense military situation. The Communist army is active six or seven miles outside the city, and the sound of gunfire at night has almost become a common adornment of daily life. When the reporter went to the fortress near the La Temple in the north of the city to visit the positions on the morning of the 17th, he could see the activities of the Communist army from a distance at about 7:00 AM. Since the military authorities decided to block the traffic on the north bank of Jiangnan, the city has obviously felt a great lack of daily necessities, and the general prices are several times higher than those in Zhenjiang. Moreover, due to the small controlled area, military grain and people's food have also become a major problem. At present, the food and fodder for the security teams in the county, in addition to appealing to the provincial authorities for subsidies, only have the option of going out of the city to seize the Communist army's public grain to maintain two meals a day.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 17th] The situation facing Yizheng is relatively calm. According to reports on the morning of the 17th, a part of the Communist army, about 7,000 people,窜to Donggou Town (about 30 miles east of Yizheng), and another 400 people harassed the National Army's fortress at the La Temple in the north of the city in the afternoon of the 17th. It has not been confirmed that the regular Communist army stationed between Tianchang and Yuyi has signs of moving south. However, the Communist army is actively carrying out the work of repairing the two highways of Yang (zhou) Yi (zheng) and Tian (chang) Yi.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 17th] About 500 Communist troops attacked Shijiaqiao and Laosihui in the Jiangbei area of Zhenjiang on the morning of the 17th, and retreated westward after being counterattacked by the National Army.

### Legislative Yuan to Review the Case of Stopping the Conscription of Military Grain, the Subgroup to Continue Review Today, Relevant Units to be Invited to Attend and Explain

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Legislative Yuan's subcommittee for reviewing the case of quickly stopping the conscription of military grain held a preliminary review meeting at 9:00 AM on the 17th, chaired by Yang Yifeng. The members spoke successively, summarizing the opinions into two types: One type believes that conscription of military grain is necessary, and although it has not been handled well in the past, reforms should be sought in the system and should not be abolished. Another opinion is that the malpractices of conscription of military grain are numerous, which is not beneficial to the country and harmful to the people, and should be stopped quickly to alleviate the people's difficulties. The discussion was held until 12:00 noon, and it was decided to continue the review on the 19th and send a letter to the relevant units such as the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Food, and the United Logistics Headquarters to send personnel to attend and explain at that time.

### Deng Wenyi Says it is Unwise to Stop Conscription and Military Grain at Present

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Deng Wenyi, Director of the Political Work Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, made a speech on the matter of senators in a few areas requesting to stop conscription and military grain, saying: The Communist area has recently been fully mobilized to expand the army and conscript grain to support the front line. Before peace has not been realized and has not been guaranteed, the government must prepare for war and seek peace in order to protect the lives and property of the people. Therefore, stopping conscription and military grain is unwise and should not be done. However, the institutions and methods of conscription and military grain should be improved. It is also reported that the Communist Party has sent letters to senators in various counties in Jiangnan, forcing them to launch a campaign to stop conscription and military grain, stop military supplies, and stop organizing security teams. This is the Communist Party's biggest conspiracy, and we should be deeply vigilant.

### Control Yuan to Review Politics Today, Divided into Two Departments: Political Innovation and Promotion of Peace, the Impeachment of Sun Ke Will Be Sent to the Disciplinary Committee

### Editorial: Preparing for Peace Talks

—Fourth of Our Hopes for President He—

On the day the Shanghai peace delegation returned from Beiping, the atmosphere of peace was momentarily strong. The saying "Although there are many difficulties, there is great hope" stirred public and private circles alike. Even rumors that the date for peace talks would be after the middle of this month and that the location would be in Beiping seemed to paint a picture of the Chinese Communists being willing to negotiate peace.

However, evidence from the news of the past week, such as the communist army concentrating over 300,000 troops north of the Yangtze River, the recent southward movement of over 100,000 men of Lin Biao's forces to Xuzhou, the bridgeheads along the north bank of the Yangtze River being threatened, the communist army's deployment for crossing the river being almost complete, and the Chinese Communist broadcasts denouncing Acting President Li and President He for still staging a "fake peace," all seem to contradict what the Shanghai delegation reported. "The mountain rain is about to come, the wind fills the tower." As far as the Jiangnan region is concerned, it has truly reached the eve of the mountain rain. The government and the people should no longer be able to rest easy!

At this time, a political storm has arisen within the government. The collapse of the Sun cabinet is not worth discussing, and the new cabinet, due to the reduction of ministries and the constraints of factionalism, has been slow to form, and even slower to consider the grand plan of how to negotiate peace. This is truly like a great fire already raging, while we are still waiting to repair the fire engines and mobilize firefighters. The danger is not difficult to imagine. Under the pressure of the Chinese Communist army, Acting President Li ordered President He to prepare for peace talks?

Regarding peace talks, regardless of their future success or failure, there are at least two points that the current government must urgently prepare for:

(1) The Strength for Peace Talks. Some may think that once peace talks are desired, there is no need to consider strength. However, without the strength to negotiate peace, there is no need to talk about peace, only surrender. Because if one side of the peace talks already considers itself powerless, or even if it has power but does not believe in its power, or cannot make good use of its power, then what is called peace talks is nothing but obediently following orders. Others may think that if there is strength, it is better to fight than to talk about peace. This is another great mistake. Of course, only by being able to fight can there be peace. Therefore, the strength for peace talks should be the strength for war. However, using the same strength not to seek war but to seek peace becomes the strength for peace talks. Therefore, using this "able to fight" strength to seek peace, then peace talks may almost succeed. If even this remaining "able to fight" strength is weakened, or if we do not even ask how much of this "able to fight" strength remains, thinking that these are all sufficient to hinder peace talks, and only seek to please the Communist Party by "catering to its wishes," we dare to say that peace talks will have no hope of success, and the result of surrender will be that the government suffers its humiliation and the people suffer its hardship.

President He has been in the revolution for decades. As a famous general who has contributed to the country, he has accepted a difficult task. His greatest task is to consolidate this strength that can both fight and negotiate peace, and to seek peace with sincerity. Where is this strength then? Mencius once said: Heavenly timing is not as good as geographical advantage, and geographical advantage is not as good as human harmony. The Yangtze River is a natural barrier between the two armies, and if the government can closely coordinate the navy, air force, and army, it cannot be said that it does not have geographical advantage. Today's problem is how to achieve "human harmony." If generals and generals do not get along, or soldiers and officers do not get along, or officers and the military do not get along, or soldiers and soldiers do not get along, or the military and the people do not get along, or the people and the officials do not get along, or the people and the people do not get along, or if one, two, or three of these exist, or even if all of them exist, how much strength remains? Therefore, to increase the strength for peace talks, we must strengthen the strength of war preparations. These seem to be contradictory, but in reality, they are complementary.

Therefore, the task of the He cabinet after its formation is first to unify the will of the central and local authorities, and to reduce the gap between military factions. Secondly, it must improve the treatment of soldiers, and especially make generals and soldiers share life and hardship. Furthermore, it must disregard everything to rectify the discipline of the army, so that the people are happy to be close to the soldiers, and all the corrupt habits of the army must be swept away. Finally, the harsh policies and complicated laws of the past should be abolished with the determination of a strong man cutting off his wrist, to show a fresh start with the people, and then the lost popular support can be regained. Only in a situation of internal and external unity, military and civilian integration, and unity of purpose can we boost morale and have the real strength to negotiate peace. Otherwise, the result of deceiving ourselves and others will be that no place will be spared the fate of Beiping and Tianjin!

(2) The Method of Peace Talks. We hope that the peace talks will succeed, and we should allow people's representatives to take on the responsibility of mediation and reconciliation in the process of peace talks. The failure of the past Political Consultative Conference and the lack of success of the Three-Man Committee were due to the fact that neither side put the people in their eyes. Everything was secretly discussed by the representatives of both sides. Although General Marshall participated in it, he was not a Chinese after all, and his pain was shallower, and success was naturally difficult. Now, learning from past mistakes, the government should advocate that people's representatives participate in the peace talks, and the progress of the peace talks, whether it is the proposal or consultation of conditions, or the discussion and debate between the representatives of both sides, should be made public every day, to show the supreme meaning of public interest and accept the constant criticism of the people of the whole country, so that many unreasonable and unnecessary disputes can be reduced, and even if there are disputes, it is not difficult to be convinced by public reason and justice, and receive the good fruit of mutual tolerance and concession.

Furthermore, during the peace talks, the government must have a plan for flexible advance and retreat, and must never be forced into a corner, regardless of everything, to sign a treaty under duress. Because since it is called peace talks, there will inevitably be back-and-forth consultations, again and again. Who can predict the changes in the situation? If we cling to the saying "sincere desire for peace" and think that the communist army may as well advance to Guazhou and Caishi along the Yangtze River front, while our government must always remain in the place threatened by the communist artillery fire in order to negotiate peace, then misleading the country and harming the people will eventually be too late to regret. It must be known that peace talks are the business of peace representatives, and if there are any requests, they can be sent by telegram back and forth, and the government does not need to stay on the front line. If it is said that if the peace talks fail and there is another war, the government should not move its center of gravity, then it is even more inappropriate. Because if there is a war again, the command of the front line is the business of the generals, not the duty of the central authorities. Wang Fuzhi once commented on Emperor Huizong of Song: "Emperor Huizong fled south to avoid the bandits. The situation was pressing and he could not avoid it. Avoiding it was not enough to destroy him. In terms of the situation, not cutting off the head does not mean losing the life. In terms of reason... the feudal lords abandon their countries but do not lose their countries, and the emperor abandons the capital but still owns the world, and has not lost his hereditary inheritance, so he has not lost much... Only Li Gang did not understand this, cherishing this isolated city surrounded by enemies on all sides, retaining this court with its trivial discussions, leading these treacherous and partisan officials, sacrificing this attachment to luxurious life, and the soldiers of the captives retreated for a while, and the singing and dancing continued as before... In the end, the two emperors were captured, the six palaces were captured, the gold and silk were exhausted, and the empty city was frozen and starved, and they could not escape to make a living, and the upper and lower levels cut off their fate." After reading this passage, we deeply feel that Acting President Li and President He should make proper considerations about the location of the central government during the peace talks, and should not hesitate and hesitate to bring disaster upon themselves, so that future generations will look at today as today looks at the past!

### Taiwan Advances Towards the Path of People's Livelihood: Reforming Land and Striving for Production, Chen Cheng Talks About Post-Takeover Measures in Nanjing

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Under the leadership of Chairman Chen Cheng, Taiwan will "promote the Three Principles of the People, implement land reform, and strive for production to achieve the goal of people's livelihood." This is what Chairman Chen Cheng said when he met with our reporter at the Capital Hotel residence at midnight on the 16th. Chen said: "We want to use this as an experiment to solve the problem of people's livelihood. Can it be achieved without bloodshed?" Chen continued: "In the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Conference, it has been decided to reduce the rent for landlords by 37.5 per thousand, and it has been supported by people throughout the province. This can be used as the initial realization of land reform." Chen also said: "Our experiment can allow ordinary people to evaluate, which is better, to realize the Three Principles of the People or to implement other policies?" Chen's words truly have the determination to make Taiwan Province a model area for the realization of the Three Principles of the People. Chen's explanation of the general situation in Taiwan Province believes that the current financial, economic, and financial situation can achieve consistency, which is quite satisfactory. However, since people from other provinces have gone there, food is slightly lacking, so we are currently starting from restricting entry and increasing food production. Secondly, the problem of housing needs to be solved. Chen then said: "This Taiwan Provincial Administrative Conference can be said to be a manifestation of the politics of the whole people. The administrative chief and the speaker of the council both participated, and they were able to express their opinions freely, so the harvest was excellent." Chen was very satisfied with this. Finally, when the reporter asked about the release of Zhang Xueliang, Chen said: "This is not a matter for local officials."

### US ECA Continues to Aid China: New Bill Stipulates Until the End of This Year, Still $80 Million Unused

[US News Agency, Washington, 16th] According to officials of the ECA (Economic Cooperation Administration) in charge of aid to China, the economic aid to China bill currently in the US Senate will enable the ECA to continue aid until about the end of June this year.

This bill was proposed in the House of Representatives on Tuesday by John Kee, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. At that time, John Lapp, head of the ECA's China Division, and S.M. Cleveland, director of the ECA's aid to China program, stated that the bill was an action bill.

Lapp and Cleveland pointed out that the characteristic of this bill is to supplement the Aid to China Act of 1948, which stipulated one year of economic aid to China from April 3, 1948. This supplementary bill will continue Congress's authority for economic aid to China until December 31, 1949. However, the two officials stated that under this authority, all available funds can only continue aid to China for three months.

According to the congressional appropriation of $275 million last year for economic aid to China, approximately $80 million has not yet been used. However, the ECA expects that before the current bill expires at midnight on April 2, $22 million will have to be withdrawn from the unused aid to China funds to purchase new approved cases of reconstruction materials.

Therefore, under the proposed extension of the Aid to China Act, there will be a balance of $58 million available to continue helping China. According to Craig and others, at the current rate of expenditure, the funds will be exhausted by the end of June. Cleveland said that the ECA does not intend to use this small appropriation for the entire period stipulated in the supplementary bill. According to the supplementary bill, aid to China will be extended until the end of 1949.

When answering questions, Lapp and others said that the ECA is satisfied with the issues covered by the new bill and the extended period. Cleveland and Lapp said that the ECA has not considered recommending a new economic aid to China plan, nor is it responsible for making any recommendations. Cleveland said that whether to continue aid to China will be decided by the State Department, the President, and Congress. It is said that in the coming weeks, the funds for the reconstruction of South China will be used to purchase rice, cotton, wheat, and implement the Chinese rural reconstruction plan. It has been pointed out that although Congress has appropriated $275 million to implement the Chinese economic reconstruction plan, the maximum amount of funds approved for this plan can be up to $338 million. Lapp and Cleveland said that the ECA does not require the $63 million appropriated by the John Kee bill. The main point of the bill is to extend the effective period so that the balance of the original $275 million in aid can continue to be used for aid to China after April 2.

If Congress passes the John Kee bill on April 3, 1949, both the House and Senate must pass a new appropriation bill so that the unspent balance of the original $275 million can continue to be used for aid to China after April 2. The John Kee bill stipulates that before Congress passes this appropriation bill, the Reconstruction Bank can advance the ECA $50 million for aid to China.

### Stones From Other Hills: General Barr's Remarks in the US, Believes the National Army's Failure Was Due to Lack of Fighting Spirit, Another Reason Was Lack of Talent and Corruption

[United Press, Washington, 16th] General David Barr, the former head of the US military advisory group in China, who has withdrawn and returned to the United States, spoke with reporters today about the key to the victory or defeat in the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communists. He said that the major problem with the defeat of the Chinese government army was the disintegration of military morale, and no single defeat could be attributed to a lack of weapons and ammunition. Another major reason was the lack of talent and corruption in the military. The Chinese government army can be said to have embraced defeatism from top to bottom, especially since the soldiers' salaries were low and their rations were poor, which led to even less fighting spirit. A large part of the weapons used by the communist army were American equipment seized from the National Army. He had never seen any Soviet equipment in the communist army. The claim that there were Soviet officers in the communist army was only seen in rumors and had no factual basis. The US military aid of $125 million worth of materials reached the front line only to a limited extent before the collapse of the National Army, and most of it is now being preserved by the Chinese government in Taiwan. Even now, the communist army has only a few aircraft. The National Army, at its peak, had about 460 US-made B-24 and B-25 bombers and B-51 fighters during the war, of which 275 could be used in combat. Barr said: "There is corruption in the Chinese government army. Although I have no formal report, I see that officers' salaries are low, but they always travel in expensive cars, which cannot help but arouse suspicion." Barr estimated that the Chinese government army had a total of 3 to 4 million troops, including 100,000 in the air force and 50,000 in the navy. Barr also said that although Chiang Kai-shek has stepped down from the presidency, he still has a great number of supporters in the country. The US military advisory group was about to make a great contribution to the Chinese government army when the situation changed drastically and it had to withdraw.

### Severe Economic Crisis in North China, Price and Wage Problems, the Communist Party Feels Extremely Troubled, Unable to Thoroughly Implement Planned Policies

[Our Dispatch] The economy of North China under the control of the Communist Party is currently in a serious crisis, which has not yet been resolved. Some of the news broadcast by the Chinese Communist radio in recent days reflects the suffering of the people's lives. At present, the Communist Party is still allowing the economy of the cities to retain the original appearance of the old era. This is not because the Chinese Communist Party recognizes the economic form of North China as a reasonable development, but the fact is that it is temporarily unable to thoroughly implement its planned policies. According to the broadcasts of the Chinese Communist radio, the serious economic phenomena in North China are one, the price problem, and the other is that the wages of workers cannot support their families, and they are making requests to the Communist Party authorities. For the former, the Communist Party's countermeasure is to actively increase production in order to solve this crisis. The People's Bank has decided to hold production loans to support private and state-owned enterprises such as steel, textiles, transportation, and public utilities that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood. Regarding the latter, because the wages earned by workers are not enough to solve their lives, they cannot achieve the class interests advocated by the Communist Party, and they are gradually becoming resentful. Therefore, the "payment in kind system" has been adopted as a remedy. This "payment in kind system" was originally implemented in the Northeast and is now also being extended to North China. The method is that the cooperative supplies 70% of the workers' wages in kind, so that they can be unaffected by price fluctuations. Yesterday, the Tianjin news broadcast by the Chinese Communist radio openly admitted that wage problems occurred between labor and management in the Zhenzhong Rubber Factory and the Beiyang Match Factory. The workers of the Zhenzhong Rubber Factory stated that their wages were too low, which affected the workers' production emotions. After mediation by the Tianjin Office of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party, the wages have been increased. The Beiyang Match Factory's wages were too high, which affected the expansion of reproduction by the capital. After the hard work of the office, the wages were reduced, but the capital was ordered to earnestly improve safety equipment and bear the medical expenses of those injured on the job, in order to improve the workers' living conditions, thereby increasing production and solving the shortage of materials and panic. According to reliable sources, after the workers in the Northeast and North China were controlled by the Communist Party, their working hours have been increased from eight to ten hours, and "labor heroes" and "piece-rate wages" have been used to reward diligent workers. Recently, three or four out of ten of the news broadcasts by the Chinese Communist radio have been of this kind of news, which alone is enough to reflect the difficulties of the Communist Party's situation.

Now, in order to increase production, the Chinese Communist Party is launching a "production competition" with the theme of welcoming the first May Day Labor Day after liberation, encouraging workers to become labor heroes, improving work efficiency, increasing production, and assisting the Communist Party in "liberation work."

### Four County Magistrates Transferred in Zhejiang

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 17th Dispatch] The Zhejiang Provincial Government transferred four county magistrates on the 17th: Zhu Gengsheng of Songyang was dismissed and arrested for colluding with bandits, and Li Hetao was appointed to succeed him.

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 17th Dispatch] Zhejiang Chairman Zhou Yan believes that county magistrates and self-defense forces have recently been repeatedly involved in colluding with bandits, dereliction of duty, and loss of firearms.

After careful discussion at the provincial government meeting, the matter was handed over to the Personnel Section of the Civil Affairs Department for review.

### Handling Foreigners' Real Estate: Philippine Senate Passes Bill, Affecting the Interests of Overseas Chinese

[Central News Agency, Manila, 16th Dispatch] The Philippine Senate, which had been in recess for three weeks due to the struggle between opposing factions for leadership in the elections, reconvened today. The first bill to be considered is one that deems all land acquired by foreigners as a violation of the Philippine Constitution and will pass a disposition bill. Authoritative figures among the overseas Chinese here believe that this bill will greatly affect the interests of overseas Chinese in the Philippines. The bill stipulates that all land purchased by foreigners after the effective date of the Constitution in 1936 must be transferred to persons legally authorized to manage the land in accordance with the law. If the transfer is not automatically carried out in accordance with the law within the specified period, the Philippine government will auction it off on behalf of the owners. The bill has now been submitted to the House of Representatives for approval. Furthermore, this measure will also affect the British, French, and Spanish expatriates here, as they also control a large amount of real estate. However, this bill will not affect American expatriates, as they enjoy the same civil rights as Filipinos under the Bell Trade Act.

If a reasonable solution cannot be found in the short term, he will resign to show his sincere concern. Furthermore, regarding the treatment of provincial schools, Mr. Xu stated that the Sichuan Provincial Affairs Conference has approved the one-time issuance of food rice for February, March, and April, and the salary for March will be issued at 150 times the normal amount. He hoped that they would relay this message and calmly resume classes, awaiting instructions from the Central Government.

### Contents of North Atlantic Treaty to be Announced Simultaneously in Eight Capitals Today; Formal Invitation Extended to Portugal, Denmark, Italy, and Iceland to Participate; Turkish Foreign Minister to Visit the U.S. to Discuss Mediterranean Alliance

[Our Newspaper Report] Washington, 17th Broadcast: Acheson's negotiations with Icelandic Foreign Minister Benediktsson have successfully concluded, and a joint communiqué has been issued. Mr. Acheson emphasized that the purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty is purely to maintain world peace and that it was drafted based on the United Nations Charter. Mr. Benediktsson emphasized that Iceland's situation is different because it has no army and stated that Iceland will not agree to allow the military forces of any country to use Iceland's bases in peacetime.

[Reuters, Washington, 17th Dispatch] The eight founding nations of the Atlantic Treaty, namely the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, and Canada, have jointly invited Denmark, Iceland, Italy, and Portugal to participate in the formal signing ceremony of the Atlantic Treaty in Washington on April 4 as founding nations. The invitations specifically request the foreign ministers of the four countries to come to Washington in the first week of April to attend the signing ceremony. The draft of the Atlantic Treaty was sent out simultaneously with the invitations, and its contents will be announced simultaneously in the capitals of the participating countries tomorrow. The eight countries invited Denmark and the other three countries to be founding members of the Atlantic Treaty. Ireland was not included because the Irish government did not give a clear response to the previous informal invitation. Ireland stated two weeks ago that it has no intention of participating in the Atlantic Treaty until North and South Ireland are unified. Diplomatic figures here expect that the responses of Italy, Portugal, Denmark, and Iceland accepting the invitation can be delivered to Washington before the weekend. Portugal's position has been clearly stated in negotiations held in Lisbon and Washington. Italy and Iceland have also expressed their willingness to participate in the treaty in informal contacts. Denmark has requested guarantees regarding the Greenland base, requiring that the base in Greenland not be borrowed except in emergency situations. Italy has no problems with participating in the Atlantic Treaty on the part of its government. Although the Communist Party and the left-wing Socialist Party oppose it in the parliament, the ruling party holds a majority in the parliament, so the opposition party will not be able to do anything.

[Reuters, Washington, 16th Dispatch] People here believe that under the current circumstances, Spain will not be invited to participate in the Atlantic Treaty, and Portugal, although it has close relations with Spain, will not object to Spain's failure to participate.

[United Press, Istanbul, 16th Dispatch] Well-informed sources claim that Turkish Foreign Minister Sadak will soon go to Washington to discuss the conclusion of a Mediterranean joint defense treaty. Previously, Sadak declared in Congress that Turkey is in contact with Britain and the United States in order to conclude a Mediterranean alliance. The nature of the alliance is important, but there has not yet been a real decision. This treaty will include Britain, France, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. Spain may also join in the future.

### Obstructing Participation in the Atlantic Alliance: Italian Communists Adopt Delaying Tactics; Congressional Debate Lasts for Over a Day and Night with Much Confusion; Demonstrations Occur in Major Cities Across the Country

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 17th Broadcast: Rome Report, today the Italian Communist Party has begun action against the Italian government participating in the North Atlantic Treaty. In Congress, Communist Party members are delaying the vote with extremely lengthy speeches, having spoken for 23 consecutive hours, with 80 Communist Party members still prepared to continue speaking. In the city of Terni in central Italy, workers held a large demonstration. Police charged at the workers with jeeps, killing one person and injuring 14. Mass protests were held last night and today in Milan, Genoa, Turin, Naples, and other cities, but no incidents occurred.

[Reuters, Rome, 17th Dispatch] The Italian Communist Party violently attempted to prevent Italy from participating in the Atlantic Treaty in the House of Representatives this morning. The debate on the treaty in the House of Representatives has been continuing from yesterday afternoon until noon today. The speaker became impatient and left the chamber twice, but Communist Party members insisted on exercising their right to speak. According to the constitution, each member must be allowed to speak for at least five minutes, and more than 100 members have requested to speak one by one. Therefore, it is expected that the debate may continue until late at night or even tomorrow morning before a vote can be taken. Prime Minister Gasperi attended the debate in the House of Representatives all night, becoming the main target of the Communist Party members' attacks. Some called him a liar, a fool, and told him to get out of the chamber. Mr. Gasperi tried to stand up and speak three times, but was prevented by Communist Party members singing "The Internationale." At the height of the debate, Communist Party members and Christian Democrats began punching each other, which lasted for 20 minutes before stopping. When Gasperi was finally able to stand up and speak, emphasizing that Italy had benefited from the Marshall Plan and must participate in the Atlantic Treaty, a Communist Party member shouted "No more bowing to Wall Street" and "Down with American imperialism." The speaker was unable to maintain order and left the chamber for 15 minutes. The government has taken strict security measures in fear that the Communist Party may launch a riot after the vote. The Italian General Confederation of Labor, controlled by the Communist Party, has declared that it will launch a nationwide strike immediately after Congress approves participation in the Atlantic Treaty.

### Three Nordic Countries Closely Interrelated

Sweden Confident in Ability to Resist the Enemy

[Reuters, Stockholm, 17th Dispatch] Swedish Defense Forces Commander-in-Chief Jung stated that in the event of war, Sweden can conduct a delaying defensive war alone for a considerable period of time, but will eventually need foreign assistance. Sweden has a curved coastline, a large area, and treacherous terrain, so even if the enemy has an advantage, it will definitely not be able to occupy all of Sweden in one fell swoop. Mr. Jung said that although Sweden maintains neutrality, the Western countries have invited Denmark and Norway to join the Atlantic Treaty, which shows that they attach importance to the position of Scandinavia. Therefore, once a war breaks out, the Western countries will definitely be able to assist Sweden.

### Danish Foreign Minister Returns from the U.S.

[Associated Press, Copenhagen, 17th Dispatch] Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen returned here today to report to the Prime Minister on his visit to the United States.

### U.S. and Britain Accuse Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary of Violating Treaty Obligations

Expanding Military Strength and Suppressing Human Rights

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 16th Dispatch] The State Department issued a statement today explaining that the treaty obligations of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania and the rights of other signatory countries remain unchanged. The statement said that the U.S. government therefore "reserves all rights under the treaty, including the right to invoke appropriate procedures for interpretation and enforcement." The statement accuses the three countries of violating their treaty obligations and accuses the Soviet Union of hindering the implementation of the treaty. The recent trial of religious leaders in Bulgaria and Hungary is cited as an example of these countries violating the treaty.

[Reuters, London, 16th Dispatch] British Minister of State McNeil told the House of Commons today that Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary, with the support of the Soviet Union, are preventing Britain and the United States from establishing supervisory bodies to ensure the implementation of treaty provisions. Romania and Bulgaria have both violated the military provisions of the treaty, and Hungary is also planning to expand its military strength in disregard of treaty restrictions. The three countries have also violated the provisions of the treaty regarding the protection of human rights and the economic section. In the 18 months from the signing of the treaty to the 15th of this month, the treaty stipulated that any disputes regarding the implementation of treaty provisions should be jointly acted upon by the heads of the diplomatic missions of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union stationed in the capital of that country. At the end of 1947, Britain and the United States decided to require Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria to inform them of the status of their national troops in accordance with the treaty provisions. However, the governments of the three countries refused the British and American requests on the pretext that the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union must act jointly. The British government therefore had to recognize that these former enemy governments colluded with the Soviet government to avoid fulfilling the treaty provisions.

### MacArthur States No Intention of Retiring: Plans to Continue Serving Until the Signing of the Japanese Peace Treaty; Japan Welcomes MacArthur's Statement

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch] General MacArthur issued a formal statement at noon today stating that he intends to remain in his position as head of the Allied General Headquarters in Japan until the signing of the peace treaty. He has no intention of relinquishing his current position as long as he is not transferred by the U.S. government to serve elsewhere.

MacArthur issued this statement to deny recent foreign reports speculating that the control work of the occupation of Japan would be taken over by civilians and that MacArthur would retire accordingly. He dismissed these reports as rumors with no basis in fact.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch] A Japanese government spokesman said on the 17th that he welcomed MacArthur's statement. Cabinet Secretary Masuda represented Prime Minister Yoshida in saying: "We welcome General MacArthur's statement with the greatest gratitude, as the General, who has made great contributions to Japan's reconstruction and democratization, will continue to serve until after the signing of the Japanese peace treaty." When the Japanese spokesman announced the welcome, most Japanese people responded to the announcement with one question: "When will the peace treaty be signed?" MacArthur's statement did not indicate when he believed the peace treaty could be signed.

### Japan's Implementation of Reform Still Requires One Year

Washington Authority's Remarks

[French News Agency, Washington, 16th Dispatch] According to authoritative sources, the transfer of military authorities to civilian authorities within Japan must be implemented after a similar transfer is completed in Germany. In the case of Germany, the policies of the United States, Britain, and France must first be clarified and coordinated. At least one year is still required before concrete steps can be taken in Japan.

### Havana Conference: Seeking Solutions to Colonial Issues; U.S., Chile, and Brazil Not Participating

[United Press, Havana, Cuba, 17th Dispatch] A conference of 14 Latin American countries, which opened here on the 15th, will discuss ways to end the colonial rule of European countries such as Britain, France, and the Netherlands in the Western Hemisphere. The conference was convened by the Pan-American Conference held in the capital of Colombia last year. Participants include Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela. The United States, Brazil, and Chile refused to send representatives to attend because the United States believes that the conference may violate the Pan-American Agreement or the United Nations Charter if it intends to achieve its goals. The main issues to be dealt with this time include the sovereignty of British Honduras, which is contested by Guatemala and Mexico, and the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands, which is contested by Britain, the United States, and Chile. The conference is chaired by Argentine representative Corominas, who said in his opening speech that the purpose of the conference is to find a peaceful solution to the colonial issue.

[Report from our Newspaper] London, 17th broadcast, Rangoon News, official sources, the Burmese government is considering holding consultations with the Karen people to form a joint government. It is believed here that the Karen people will demand to control three ministries in the joint government, but have not yet responded to the government's appeal.

[United Press London, 17th] The fall of Rangoon, the capital of Burma, is now considered inevitable, as the Karen people have captured Waw. The Karen people, fighting for autonomy, now control the Gibelin Road from Rangoon to Waw.

[Associated Press Rangoon, 17th] Officials announced today that the government recently declared its willingness to grant amnesty to the Karen people in the Insein area, on the condition that they surrender their weapons. This proposal expired today, and the Karen people have not responded. Therefore, the government will launch a large-scale offensive against the rebels. The fighting in the Insein area is continuing, and it is reported that Karen reinforcements have broken through the government defenses. As for the proposal to grant amnesty to other Karen people, it will expire at the end of this month.

[Another Dispatch] The Burmese government is about to undergo a reorganization, co-opting the White Flag People's Volunteer Organization into the cabinet. The leader of the group is currently meeting in Mandalay, a major city in central Burma, and whether national peace can be restored depends on the outcome of the meeting. The People's Volunteer Organization will soon hold a meeting with the Socialist Party and the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League to resolve major political issues and clear various obstacles before the general election this summer.

[Another Dispatch] Officials announced today that Mandalay is now managed by Communist leader Yang Aung after its fall.

[United Press London, 16th] A Calcutta dispatch from the Daily Telegraph, citing railway contractors arriving from Burma, stated that the fall of Rangoon is only a "matter of time."

### The Security Council is Divided on the Situation in the Dutch East Indies

Cuba, Australia, and the Philippines Oppose the Sino-Canadian Compromise Proposal

[Reuters Lake Success, 16th] Norwegian Representative Soht urged the Security Council today during the debate on the Indonesian question to establish some kind of monitoring system to see whether the rules of humanitarian warfare are also being strictly observed in small-scale battles. In the war in Indonesia, both sides had accused each other of inhumane acts. He believed that the United Nations must do its best to prevent atrocities from happening. Regarding the Indonesian question itself, Soht supported the suggestions of the Canadian and Chinese representatives, advocating preliminary talks to determine the status of the Republic, which could make the round-table conference proposed by the Netherlands in The Hague a success. French Representative Chauvel also supported the Canadian proposal. Cuban Representative Alvarez argued that the Netherlands had not implemented the Security Council's resolutions and attempted to solve the problem in its own way. He demanded that the Security Council order the Netherlands to strictly implement the Security Council's resolutions, believing that the leaders of the Indonesian Republic must be completely restored to freedom, the Indonesian Republic must return to Yogyakarta, and military action must be stopped. Only after these prerequisites were met could the Security Council consider various proposals on the Indonesian question. Australian Representative Holt expressed dissatisfaction that some countries that had previously supported the Security Council's resolutions were now asking the Security Council to overturn its resolutions. He hoped that the Security Council would act cautiously on the proposals put forward by China and Canada to avoid violating the Security Council's resolution on the Indonesian question of January 28.

[Associated Press Lake Success, 16th] The Security Council continued to discuss the Indonesian question today. Philippine Representative Romulo said that the Security Council must not take any measures to abandon its resolution of January 28.

[United States Information Service Lake Success, 16th] The United Nations Security Council continued to discuss the Indonesian case today, but adjourned without a resolution and will continue to discuss it next week.

### Anecdotes from the British Art Scene

A Famous 17th-Century Painting Wanders into the Antique Market

[Associated Press London, 16th] Mrs. Piddon here has always been dissatisfied with an oil painting among her late artist husband's estate. The painting depicts a nude woman stabbing herself with a knife. Mrs. Piddon took it to auction and sold it to an antique dealer for fifty shillings, or ten US dollars. The antique dealer then exchanged it with another person for a typewriter worth about fifty-six US dollars. The painting then fell into the hands of an artist and was sold yesterday for the high price of three thousand two hundred pounds, or thirteen thousand eight hundred US dollars. It was then discovered that it was a masterpiece by the 17th-century art master Rubens, based on the myth of Queen Dido of Tyre, called "The Suicide of Dido." After hearing about this, Mrs. Piddon still said: "This kind of painting should not be hung in anyone's home."

Although Yugoslav newspapers received here did not publish the facts of the major riots, they stated that the Cominform was launching a movement to support counter-revolutionaries. The people of Trieste all expect major developments to occur soon. It is rumored that security has been greatly increased in the area facing the island of Brioni along the coast of Istria, with guards lining the 30 kilometers of coastline from Pula to the Lim Canal. Some also said that some of the defensive troops at the junction of Yugoslavia and Trieste had been replaced by Yugoslav secret police to prevent Yugoslav soldiers from escaping to the Anglo-American zone of Trieste.

### Leak of US Atomic Secrets; Lump of Uranium Found on a Mexican Man

[Report from our Newspaper] New York, 17th Broadcast: Mexico City News, there has been another leak of US atomic secrets. At least one piece of refined uranium has been smuggled into Mexico. According to scientists, this uranium may have been stolen from a laboratory in the United States that manufactures atomic bombs.

### The Soviet Union Should Bear Full Responsibility for the Berlin Stalemate; US, Britain, and France Issue Statements; Currency Reform in West Berlin to be Implemented Soon

[Reuters Berlin, 16th] The Speaker of the West Berlin City Council, Saul, revealed that currency reform in West Berlin will be implemented soon. It is rumored that after the new currency reform, East German marks will not be allowed to circulate in West Berlin, and the West German mark will be the only currency in West Berlin. Financial experts in both West and East Berlin are busy drawing up plans to deal with the future currency reform in West Berlin.

[Associated Press Lake Success, 16th] Security Council President Alvarez released the report of the Berlin Currency Committee tonight, stating that efforts to resolve the currency problem had completely failed. Western countries then issued a statement blaming the Soviet Union for the failure. The Currency Committee was formed last year by representatives of six neutral countries (China, Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Syria, and Colombia). Its report was drafted last month and only released today. Alvarez hinted that other neutral countries on the Security Council have no plans to reopen the debate on the Berlin issue, unless requested by a major power. Well-informed sources said that the United States, Britain, or France have no intention of bringing up the currency issue again. The US State Department issued a statement saying that Western countries are still prepared to consider a fair solution to the currency issue to protect the legitimate interests of the people in both East and West Berlin. The Currency Committee attempted to resolve this problem technically, but because of the actions of the Soviet Union, this problem has expanded into a technical problem and therefore cannot be resolved.

[Reuters London, 16th] The British Foreign Office issued a statement saying that because of the incompatible split in Berlin, encouraged by the Soviet authorities, there is no possibility of breaking the stalemate in the Berlin currency issue. A statement was also issued in Paris, stating that every action that expands the division between the occupying countries in financial and economic terms is taken by the Soviet authorities.

### Mayor Wu Firmly Determined to Resign; Will Submit Resignation to the New Cabinet; Many Bureau Chiefs Express Weariness

[Report from our Newspaper] Recently, various circles in the city have been speculating about Mayor Wu Guozhen's stay or departure, with rumors flying around. Yesterday, the reporter made a special visit to Mayor Wu to seek confirmation and learned that Mayor Wu's intention to resign is indeed very firm. According to Wu's words to the reporter: He has suffered from Burmese fever (commonly known as malignant malaria) for more than a month, and although he has sought medical treatment, it has not been eradicated. Following doctor's orders, he must take a period of rest, so he has decided to submit his resignation after the establishment of the new cabinet, requesting to resign. The reporter then inquired whether Mayor Wu's resignation was not the first time, and that he had repeatedly requested resignation in the past, but was persuaded to stay. If the Executive Yuan were to persuade him to stay again this time, would the Mayor still be able to reluctantly persevere? Wu shook his head vigorously and replied with extremely firm evidence: "Impossible, my physical strength does not allow it, I cannot force it no matter what." Judging from Wu's remarks, it seemed that his intention to resign was extremely firm. He believed that after serving as mayor for more than three years, it was time to give way to a more capable person. The reporter also inquired whether it was possible for him to join the cabinet after resigning. He said: Absolutely not, resting my body comes first, I will avoid all activities.

### Sluggish Shipping on the Shanghai-Hankou Line; China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Considering Reducing Flights

Business on the South China Line is Picking Up

According to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the passenger and freight transport business on the Yangtze River Line has been very sluggish recently. Passenger transport is only half of what it used to be, and freight transport is even more scarce. The cost of a round trip between Shanghai and Hankou is huge. Although the Shanghai-Hankou Line has been reduced to one flight every ten days, there are still too many empty seats, and the revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced. The company is currently considering reducing it to one flight every half month. The company's passenger and freight transport on the South China Line has improved, especially in passenger transport, which has made great progress. For example, the maintenance of order on board and the crackdown on passengers without tickets have been successful. Currently, important ports on the South China Line, such as Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangzhou, have regular express ships that operate regularly.

### Water and Electricity Subsidies for School Staff: Education Bureau Begins Distribution Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] The Education Bureau began distributing yesterday to various schools the municipal government's allocated water and electricity subsidies for March.  Teachers and staff received 11,700 yuan per person, and manual laborers received 5,850 yuan per person. Those whose kerosene costs were advanced by the Education Bureau will not receive payment temporarily; a separate notification will be issued regarding supplementary payment of the remaining balance after settlement. The Municipal Elementary School Teachers and Staff Association believes the amount of kerosene costs that each school should pay to the Education Bureau had already been determined and publicly announced.  This time when issuing the funds, deductions could have been calculated based on the actual number of employees at each school. If a separate notification is issued again, the value of the currency will decline during this period of rampant inflation if payment is delayed for one to two weeks, which will have a significant impact on all teachers and staff. After representatives Li Zhanren, Huang Shiping, Mao Wenpei, and others consulted with the Education Bureau, it was discovered that the error was due to a discrepancy in the reconciliation between the petroleum company and the municipal bank. It was decided to start issuing the payments tomorrow morning.

### Wang Xiaolai Sends Telegrams to Government and Communists: Calls for North-South Trade and Currency Exchange; Seek Progress Through Stability, Stability Through Progress; Restore Economic Order, Ensure Minimum Living Standards

Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the China National Products Manufacturers Association, yesterday telegraphed Acting President Li, Premier He, and CCP leaders Mao Zedong, Ye Jianying, etc., regarding the issue of North-South trade and currency exchange, putting forward his proposals. The original telegram stated: "(Salutations Omitted) I humbly believe that stability to seek progress and progress to seek stability are mutually beneficial. At present, seeking stability and seeking progress are both subjective and objective needs, and are universally desired. The essential conditions for stability and progress are that people should make the most of their talents, land should be utilized to its fullest, materials should be used efficiently, and trade should flow smoothly. These four factors must be implemented simultaneously, but their order of priority should be determined by the actual situation and changes. The reason why our people cannot fully utilize their talents, the land cannot be fully utilized, and materials cannot be fully utilized is that goods cannot flow smoothly. This is why the Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, advocated building 100,000 miles of railways and one million miles of highways to facilitate transportation. However, the current means of transportation are already unable to meet the needs. If artificial obstacles are added, it will inevitably lead to goods not being able to flow smoothly, thereby preventing people from fully utilizing their talents, the land from being fully utilized, and materials from being used efficiently. Our country's agricultural, industrial, and mineral products vary from east to west and north to south. If there is no mutual exchange of goods to make up for deficiencies with surpluses, then not only will the people's living standards inevitably decline further, but also the economic order will be disrupted. Even the government will inevitably expend more effort. It is difficult to achieve progress in instability, and it is difficult to achieve stability without progress. The current resumption of postal, telegraphic, and shipping services between the North and South has brought considerable stability to people's minds and has shown signs of social progress. In the industrial and commercial sectors, it is believed that the next step should be trade and currency exchange, and preparations are being made to increase processing and importing in the hope that the economic order can be restored to normal and the minimum living standards can be ensured. Therefore, I respectfully submit my humble observations in this telegram, hoping that you will review and approve it promptly to implement trade and currency exchange, which will benefit both the public and private sectors. I bow in reverence. Wang Xiaolai, Yinxiao."

### Beijing Type (6)

— Jiang Xue

A report on a city during and after "Local Peace"

(6) The Reorganization of the Army

The National Army originally stationed in Beijing consisted of eight armies and twenty-five divisions. With the exception of the 104th Army, which is still in the city assisting with security duties, the rest have been moved outside the city. According to the agreement, they are to be reorganized into the People's Liberation Army within a month, which is certainly a major issue! In this situation where military affairs are paramount, the strength of the army is worthy of attention! If these two hundred thousand plus people are not reorganized, the CCP would at least have to station two hundred thousand plus people near Beijing to monitor them to prevent accidents. Originally, after the end of the Pingjin Campaign, Lin Biao's troops could have been transferred south to make up for Chen Yi's losses in Jiangbei and strengthen the forces crossing the Yangtze River. However, because the National Army near Beijing had not yet been reorganized, this task could not be accomplished. Therefore, the CCP attaches great importance to the army reorganization work and is actively carrying it out.

According to the original consultation, the original establishment and personnel would be reorganized. However, the current situation is developing. Whether the CCP will reorganize according to the agreement or carry out a major reform and reorganization is still unknown. The morale of this part of the National Army is very high, and they are very willing to fight with the CCP. In addition, the many humiliating events in this local peace have given them tremendous spiritual stimulation, and the fire of anger in their hearts is burning even more fiercely! If it is not reorganized according to the original agreement, this volcano may erupt.

Before I left Beijing, various rumors were being spread secretly and widely: such as Chen Yi's troops suffered two defeats in Jiangbei, with losses of more than 400,000 to 500,000 people. Ma Bufang, dissatisfied with Fu Zuoyi's surrender, has already sent troops from the northwest to attack, and Ma's cavalry has reached the Chengde area. After Okamura Neiji returned to China, Japan has sent troops to land in the Qinhuangdao area, and the train from Beijing to Shanhaiguan is no longer running. … Various rumors without factual basis are widely circulating among the National Army troops in the suburbs of Beijing, further strengthening their fighting spirit. This does not mean that these rumors are reliable, but it shows that they are still missing the central government and hoping for an opportunity to serve the country. The National Army in the suburbs of Beijing has enough food reserves for about three months, and weapons and ammunition are also quite sufficient. If the CCP does not handle it well, it may still be a loophole that could cause problems.

The CCP also knows about the spread of these rumors. They believe that this is being spread by Kuomintang military intelligence and Central Statistics Bureau agents lurking in Pingjin. Therefore, the Beijing Garrison Command has strictly ordered officers and soldiers of the 19th Regiment of Military Police scattered among the people to quickly report, submit their weapons, or face punishment. At the same time, the CCP is also paying close attention to the army reorganization work and is using a policy of breaking them up one by one, dispersing their strength, and resolving it smoothly. On the other hand, Li Jishen is using various means and personal relationships to connect with the commanders of each unit with emotions to avoid any unexpected changes. For example, Lin Weichou, the former commander of the 62nd Army and deputy commander of Tianjin's defense, was originally captured in Tianjin. Now, with Li Jishen's guarantee to the CCP, he has regained his freedom and is allowed to move freely within Beijing, but he cannot leave Beijing. According to news I heard on the way, Huang Xiang, the commander of the 92nd Army, was dismissed and detained by the CCP for being fond of dancing and considered not progressive enough, and his real estate was seized. Some troops are being transferred and isolated separately, so that their strength is dispersed and they cannot coordinate with each other. Therefore, they are taking whatever they want and destroying them one by one. It can be seen that the CCP is using very good tactics!

(7) The Situation is Getting Tighter and Tighter

Politics is something with exclusivity and control. The politics under the CCP's rule is especially tightly controlled! The CCP's party members and cadres are all special agents. They are watching you at all times and never let up. The CCP is an organizational body with only the party's resolutions and the group's will, and no personal feelings or relationships. Some people think that I have a good personal relationship with someone in the CCP, and maybe he can give me a break out of personal friendship. Some people think that I have never criticized the CCP, and he may show me some goodwill and not make things difficult for me. In fact, these are all wrong ideas. They simply do not understand the nature of the CCP! All their attitudes are based on the interests of the party. For example, before President Chiang Kai-shek retired, the CCP tried its best to attack Chiang. Everyone thought that as long as Chiang retired, the CCP would no longer attack him. As a result, Li Zongren became acting president, and the target of the attack shifted to Li. Zhang Zhizhong and Shao Lizi are the people who have dealt with the CCP the most. Everyone regards them as envoys of peace, but the CCP's attacks on Zhang and Shao are the same and will be no exception. If you do not understand the nature of the CCP and decide on how to deal with the CCP, there will inevitably be great deviations and errors.

When local peace was first achieved in Beijing, everyone was so dissatisfied with the current political situation that they placed their hopes on the CCP's rule, thinking that the CCP would organize a coalition government in Beijing and that all political measures would be different from the situation in other places, and that perhaps everyone could participate in it. There are quite a few people living in Beijing who have this idea. At the same time, when the CCP first entered the city, they had no idea about anything. The takeover work was also very urgent and needed to be dealt with. For the time being, they could not take care of many political issues. All aspects showed a generous style in order to win people's hearts. However, as the takeover work gradually got on track and they understood the situation a little more, the political control gradually strengthened, and the situation became tighter and tighter. In the end, they could not escape their original set of practices.

At the celebration of the liberation of Beijing, Beijing Mayor Ye Jianying mentioned in his speech that in order to strengthen the task of military control in Beijing, he would arrest the war criminals who must be arrested and the key figures of the reactionaries. This is obviously in conflict with the original agreement to ensure the safety of the lives of public and religious personnel. Because Fu Zuoyi, the important "war criminal" who led them in the war, can still make amends for his crimes, are there still war criminals who must be arrested?! After hearing this passage from Ye Jianying, I knew that there must be something going on here. The facts of struggle and liquidation are slowly going to be implemented skillfully under various appearances.

As expected, the People's Daily published a large article containing accusations from the families of the students who died in the July 5th Incident, shouting that blood debts must be paid in blood and asking the government to punish Xu Huidong, the culprit of the July 5th Incident. After this accompanying prelude was played, Xu Huidong was arrested and detained a few days later. What will be the end of this article in the future? I don't know now, and there's no need to predict it either.

Then, Zhang Yinwu was arrested on the charge of being a bandit leader. The People's Daily published this news as a headline; the title was "Beijing Uncovers a Major Military Espionage Case, Bandit Leader Zhang Yinwu and Others Arrested." Several photos were also attached, and the situation was very serious!

Because I have a good personal relationship with Zhang Yinwu, I know the details of this case in more detail, and it's really too unjust! Last year, Beijing's middle schools, under the leadership of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters, established winter camps. Si Cun Middle School also requested to be established as a brigade of the winter camp and requested some dilapidated guns from the Bandit Suppression Headquarters for training purposes. That's how the guns came. As for that radio, it was a Japanese-style military radio that could only communicate twenty or thirty miles away and was never used at all. Last summer, because Si Cun Middle School in Baoding was heavily in debt, Zhang asked me to try to sell it to the 208th Division in order to pay off the debt. Later, because the asking price was too high, it was not sold. But these guns and radios became Zhang Yinwu's ironclad evidence of reaction, isn't it unjust!

Why did the CCP arrest Zhang Yinwu? The main reason is that during the anti-Japanese period, Zhang served as the commander-in-chief of the Hebei Provincial People's Army, guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, did not cooperate with the CCP, and had conflicts. Because of this, the CCP hated him very much. Zhang is an honest and fair person with a very good reputation in Beijing and Hebei Province. He has a certain appeal. At the same time, some local armed forces in various counties also wanted to support him. The CCP has never allowed people who do not cooperate with them and have a way to exist. Since Zhang himself had some latent power and was in contact with Tong Shoushan and Ma Xiyuan in the Northeast, they had to arrest him and put the big hat of an espionage case on his head to prevent him from moving.

In short, the political nature of the Communist Party is a strong control. No matter what kind of appearance is used, it cannot escape this nature. The political situation in Beijing under the CCP's rule will of course only strengthen its control and the situation will become increasingly serious! Paying attention only to phenomena and ignoring the essence of the problem will cause you to have illusions and make mistakes in dealing with reality.

(8) Leaving Beijing and Passing Through the Liberated Areas

Seeing that the situation in Beijing was getting tighter and tighter, I decided that it was not a place to stay for long. I decided to leave Beijing immediately, regardless of the difficulties of the journey. At the same time, I also wanted to pass through the liberated areas and see their rule for myself.

On the morning of February 18, I began my journey from Beijing. The train ticket had been bought the day before. The train fare from Beijing to Tianjin was 96 yuan in People's Currency. There were no checks or interrogations along the way. Although the Pingjin Railway has been open for many days, the order on the train is very chaotic! Later, because the unlimited purchase of tickets was changed, it was only slightly better starting the day before, but many people still did not have seats. There are only third-class cars, no first or second class, which is a sign of equality. The train does not run very accurately. I waited for two trains along the way, each time for more than an hour. I was supposed to arrive in Tianjin at 2:00 PM, but it turned out to be after 4:00 PM that afternoon. There were no checks either.

On the 19th, I changed to a bus from Tianjin to Jinan. The fare was 1,500 yuan in People's Currency. When leaving Tianjin, you have to go through a check procedure. As long as there are no special circumstances, after being checked and given a lecture by the inspectors, you are allowed to get on the bus and leave. Passing through villages along the way, there are also two or three places where you have to stop for inspection, but it is not very strict. Most of them are released in accordance with the CCP's lenient policy. As long as you have a pass, you can say a lot less. Because Beijing had not issued a pass at that time, I did not have a pass. I only had a National Identity Card from Nanjing, so I had to say a few more words when questioned. The car we were riding in broke down after leaving Tianjin, so we had to wait for another car to continue our journey. We stayed overnight in Yixian that day. I got up at 5:00 AM the next morning, wanting to leave early and arrive in Dezhou that day. But passing by the bridge near Cangxian, there was a strict check. Because I did not have a pass and there were a few words crossed out on my identity card that did not match my personal seal, I was detained and not allowed to continue my journey. After negotiations, the bus ticket was refunded for 1,000 yuan in People's Currency. I and another person in the car were escorted to a certain place. This is a branch of the Public Security Bureau. The friend who came with me was released after being questioned, but I was detained here and not allowed to go back.

### The Shadow of Rice Panic in Taiwan

— Special Correspondent Wu Shouren

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 11th] Since the beginning of February, Taiwan has encountered unprecedented disasters. The shadow of white terror, which has always only loomed over the hearts of people from the mainland, has been followed by hordes of high-ranking refugees, fiercely attacking this isolated island! When we open the February newspapers, we see that red-plate Penglai rice is selling for NT$160,000 per 100 Taiwanese catties. At that time, the exchange rate was 1:65, which should be equivalent to over 2,460 Gold Yuan. Adding the 20% difference in weight, that means one Shanghai dan of white rice would sell for 2,952 Gold Yuan in Taiwan. Looking back at Shanghai, the red plate is selling for 4,300 Gold Yuan. The above two figures tell us that the price of rice in Taiwan is one-third cheaper than in Shanghai. This ratio has never been broken by any force in the past century. This is because Taiwan is not only a rice-producing area but also a surplus area. In the statistics of food supply and demand, it has always maintained a large surplus! Even in the year 34, when food production fell sharply, although the production volume plummeted from 1,068,121 tons to 638,828 tons, it did not encounter any difficulties in the supply and demand within the province, except for the loss of a surplus income. The ratio of Shanghai rice prices still maintained the traditional record.

How long has it been since Taiwan's pride, maintained for nearly a century, has been completely destroyed by reality! Let's look at the rice markets in Taiwan and Shanghai on February 5:

Taiwan Penglai White Rice

NT$200,000 per 100 Taiwanese catties. According to the exchange rate of 1:35 that day, plus the 20% weight difference, it should be converted into 7,130 Gold Yuan per Shanghai dan. On the same day, the black market price in Shanghai was 7,000 Gold Yuan, and the government's selling price was 4,500 Gold Yuan. The newspaper has already published the news that "Mayor Wu was shocked and furious, his voice heard outside the room." From this day on, the rice prices in Taiwan and Shanghai not only evened out, but even surpassed each other. Taiwan took the lead and quickly climbed to the peak of the most expensive region in the country! We still remember that it was February 22, when the price was NT$330,000 per 100 Taiwanese catties. The exchange rate was 1:16. Adding the weight difference, each Shanghai dan would be converted into 24,744 Gold Yuan. The retail price of white japonica rice in Shanghai was 11,000 to 12,000 Gold Yuan. Buying one dan of rice in Taiwan could buy more than two dan in Shanghai. Compared to the situation twenty days ago when buying one dan in Shanghai could buy one dan and three dou in Taiwan, the difference is like heaven and earth! The speed of the rise and the intensity of the change in the angle of the price inversion are beyond the imagination of ordinary people. Fifty-two percent of Taiwan's 1.16 million households do not produce their own food. They are in the midst of this unprecedented rice price frenzy in Taiwan's history, as if falling from heaven to hell. The feelings of indignation and worry are indescribable.

The reporter does not want to deny the various efforts and measures made by the government in this serious situation. For example, expanding the sales area and household distribution, special distribution, etc. The government is sparing no effort to make a last-ditch effort with the actual goods in its possession. At the same time, it has also widely used political power to extensively investigate and squeeze the grain reserves of large households and grain merchants, and set a deadline for sale. We cannot but admit that the government has done its best in principle to suppress rice prices. However, looking at the effect, on the day the reporter wrote this (March 9), although the price of rice in Taiwan had fallen to NT$300,000 per 100 Taiwanese catties in terms of numbers, the Gold Yuan price converted to the market price was still about 40,000 yuan according to the exchange rate of 1:9. Compared to the market price of 29,500 yuan in Shanghai on the same day, it is still more than 40% more expensive. We cannot deny that the current situation is still unreasonable. At the very least, it must restore the ratio before February 1 in order to be considered normal! This is the unanimous demand of all the people of Taiwan and also a major test for the current provincial administration.

To restore the normal rice price in Taiwan, we must first understand what forces are destroying the rice price ratio that Taiwan has maintained for nearly a century and has become a tradition. The reporter has discussed this issue with many experts separately. Combining the opinions of the majority, it can be roughly summarized into four points: First, due to the rapid turn of events, a large number of people from the mainland, such as Pingjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, have been evacuated to Taiwan, resulting in a sharp increase in consumption. Second, due to the increase in population and consumption, the large households and grain merchants who control the grain are psychologically reluctant to sell their grain reserves, which affects the amount of grain circulating on the market. Third, the devaluation of the Taiwanese dollar itself. Fourth, due to the grain price fluctuations caused by the above three points, coupled with the precedent of the failure of the 819 price limit, people who do not have grain and high-ranking refugees who have been evacuated to Taiwan have lost confidence in the government's control of grain prices. Everyone has unanimously purchased grain for storage, so that the supply and demand problem has invisibly exceeded the budget and an imbalance has occurred, further promoting the trend of rising rice prices. From the above four points, we can draw a conclusion that the abnormal rise in rice prices in Taiwan today is entirely caused by man-made factors that are almost self-inflicted. How can this be seen? Let's look at the above four points. Except for the third point, the remaining three points should take the first point as the initial starting point. Without the first point, there would be no second and fourth points. Therefore, the reporter can provide several figures to illustrate this first point: The first thing we need to understand is how many people there are in Taiwan currently, including those evacuated from the mainland. According to the latest and most accurate statistics, the total population of Taiwan now is 6,799,196 people. According to the most standard and reasonable calculation, each person needs 144 kilograms of grain per year. The total annual need of this nearly 7 million population is 979,084.224 tons. Let's look at this year's grain harvest, which is estimated to be at least 1,068,421 tons. Then the production volume and consumption volume offset each other, leaving a surplus of 89,336.776 tons. The reporter dares to say with certainty that there are no other more accurate statistics; and no one can overthrow it with empty words. Therefore, from these figures, we can know that although everyone has intuitively felt that the population from the mainland has poured in like a tide in the past six months, it has not had an impact on the supply and demand of grain in Taiwan! It can be seen that the "sharp increase in consumption" mentioned in the first point cannot actually play any role! As for psychological stimulation, from a scientific point of view, it is untenable at all; from a political point of view, its existence cannot be recognized.

In modern economics, there is a generally accepted theory: that the price problem is the whole supply and demand problem; the grain price is one of the prices, and of course it cannot be separated from this category. However, the grain price in Taiwan has exceeded this category. What it relies on is nothing but a virtual and man-made psychological stimulation; this is definitely not an accurate theoretical basis. Therefore, in response to this perverse fact, political power is the best test! The reporter believes that there should be some technical revisions and supplements to the various measures currently being taken by the grain administration authorities: First, regarding household distribution and special distribution, according to the original method, the former is to distribute 10 catties every five days for three or more people per household based on the household registration certificate, and 10 catties every ten days for less than three people, at 70% of the market price. The latter is the same quantity as the former, but the price is increased to 90% of the market price. We feel that this measure is indeed very correct in principle; but in terms of quantity and price, there is a real need for improvement! In terms of quantity: the division of grades of quantity should be calculated meticulously, and it is best to take people as the unit, and make them get enough quantity that they do not have to buy it in the market. In terms of price, the distribution price should not follow the market price, but should lead the market price to make effective and reasonable reductions. The second is about ordering large households and grain merchants to sell their grain reserves within a limited time. We believe that this time limit should be changed to selling in installments and in quantities. For example, if the government limits a certain large household or a certain grain merchant to sell his grain reserves within half a month, it must stipulate how much he must sell every three days or every five days based on the amount of his grain reserves, and he must sell it all by the end of half a month. This can avoid delays by large households and grain merchants within the time limit, and it is also a help in suppressing grain prices.

When Mr. Chen Ci-hsiu first took over the provincial administration, he did not hesitate to devote his efforts to suppressing salt prices at a time when there were many things waiting to be done, and then promulgated the Taiwan Provincial Salt Price Parity Distribution Plan, which reduced salt prices by 40% at once. Why is this? Because he understood the importance of salt in human life. And rice certainly occupies more weight in human life history. Chen cannot say that he does not know that the current rice price exceeds the norm; only because we understand that his observation is meticulous, we believe that he must use thunderous force to restrain the rice price and restore it to normal. Therefore, in the past twenty days, when rice prices rose the most fiercely, the reporter did not engage in reports on how rampant and overbearing this white terror was in Taiwan; everyone was waiting with a heavy heart for Mr. Chen Ci-hsiu's effective countermeasures! However, a month has passed, and although rice prices have shown a slight downward trend, they are still far from normal. We believe that this is the best opportunity. The government should take this opportunity to devote all its efforts to guide rice prices back to the ratio before February 1; the people of the whole province are asking Chen to show the perseverance he had when suppressing salt prices! Because, if rice prices rekindle due to man-made factors, the situation will be even more uncontrollable. As the saying goes: "Things must rot from the inside before worms grow." Today's rice price problem is just beginning to rot and grow worms. If the government does not plan for this, it will be too late to regret it when the rot expands and the strength of the worms is cultivated.

### Injured Soldiers Assault Shoppers: Zha Pu Shut Down for a Day

[Our Pinghu, 16th Dispatch] All the shops in Zha Pu, a town under the jurisdiction of this county, closed down for one day on the 15th and resumed business on the 16th. The incident occurred around 2 PM on the 14th, when two soldiers from the 98th Hospital went to the Hongyuan Fish Shop in Haitang and bought four and a half catties of jellyfish for 400 yuan. At that time, the market price was 300 yuan per catty, but the shop did not haggle, considering that the soldiers were injured for the sake of the country and the nation. Unexpectedly, the soldiers wanted to buy 100 catties of jellyfish, with payment to be made in Pinghu. The shop staff, acting as agents for the sale, had a misunderstanding in their words. Subsequently, they brutally beat up shop employee Fan Yingnai and apprentice Chen Dahai, causing serious injuries. This aroused resentment among the merchants and residents of the entire town, and they had no choice but to close down all the shops on the 15th. They sent representatives, including Ma Hanliang, Wang Shouyu, Guo Qiaoguan, and over ten others, to the county to petition. At that time, Yu Shuting, the Administrative Inspector of the First District of Zhejiang Province, was in the county for observation. He invited Lu, the director of the 98th Hospital, and others to discuss the matter at the County Council. Furthermore, six or seven hundred merchants and residents arrived in the town by land and water, demanding punishment for the soldiers who caused the trouble, a guarantee that similar incidents would not happen again, and compensation for the damaged furniture of the Hongyuan Shop. Director Lu, having only been in office for three days, was in the process of reorganizing the hospital affairs and expressed deep regret over the incident. He immediately comforted the petitioners and promised to personally visit Zha Pu on the 16th to offer condolences and accept all requests. A satisfactory outcome was reached, and he returned to Zha Pu that evening. Director Lu, together with Commissioner Yu and County Magistrate Lou, went to Zha Pu on the morning of the 16th, and the shops had already resumed business.

### First Pacification Zone to Levy Temporary Fees

[Our Zhenjiang, 16th Dispatch] In the recent Pacification Conference held in Changzhou by the Headquarters of the First Pacification Zone, it was decided that all counties under its jurisdiction should levy temporary Pacification Zone fees to supply various military necessities. All counties will uniformly start levying the fees from April 1st. The Headquarters has already formulated detailed implementation rules and ordered all counties to comply. The main points are as follows: (A) Fundraising: (1) Legal persons and natural persons will be the target. The county magistrate will convene local legal entities to assess the assets, business volume, and income of local banks, factories, companies, firms, and wealthy households based on reasonable principles. They will then be graded and submitted to the tax collection office for separate registration and collection. (2) For special products, the tax rate will be limited to 20% to 30%. (3) Local tax rates will be adjusted, not exceeding the original standard in principle, but not less than half of the original tax rate. (B) Collection: (1) County tax collection offices will collect the fees once every three months based on the assessed grades. (2) Collection procedures will adopt a public treasury system, with the collection agency not directly receiving funds. (3) Revenue from adjusted local tax rates, the portion for the Pacification Zone's temporary fees, will be submitted to the designated public treasury for deposit. (4) The Pacification Zone's temporary fees collected from legal persons and natural persons should be based on silver dollars. If gold yuan are paid, they will be converted according to the government exchange rate. (C) Expenditure: (1) Withdrawals from the designated public treasury will be based on payment orders from the Pacification Zone Management Committee. (2) To cope with emergency needs, two-thirds of the collected amount may be retained by the County Management Committee as working capital. The District Management Committee will issue payment orders to the County Management Committee based on the County's weekly reports, for withdrawal from the County's public treasury. (3) The two-thirds retained by each county should be reviewed by the County Council on a monthly basis, with a list submitted to the District Management Committee for verification. The remaining one-third will be centrally allocated by the District Management Committee for adjustment purposes.

### Ancient Tomb Discovered in Wujin

Is it a Qin or Han Tomb? Or a Wei or Jin Burial Mound? Heads of Various Agencies Will Continue Excavation

[Our Wujin, 15th Dispatch] Outside the Xiaonanmen, two or three miles from the city, near Yunjia Village is the Yunjia Mound, originally a high hill. Recently, city defense works were constructed near this area, and during excavation, an ancient tomb was suddenly discovered. Inside, there was a small underground chamber built with huge bricks. There were three arched doorways, resembling three grand residences, indicating a considerable scale. Broken pieces of a treasured sword and figurines of celestial boys and girls were found in the soil at the entrance. The bricks were all one foot and two inches long, and six inches wide, with patterns of Wuzhu coins carved on them. Currently, three tomb doors have not yet been opened, and the coffin has not been found. The news has spread throughout the city, and tens of thousands of people are vying to explore. The City Defense Department and the County Government have specially dispatched teams to protect the site. Today, Vice Pacification Commander Jiao has invited the heads of various agencies to jointly excavate and unravel this mystery. Whether it is a Qin or Han tomb, or a Wei or Jin burial mound, remains to be verified in the future.

### Shenbao Promotes Poverty-Stricken Women's Maternity Assistance Movement: Shanghai West Ren'ai Hospital Joins the Collaboration Today

Poor Women in All Districts Where Collaborating Hospitals Are Located Can Apply

The "Readers' Maternity Assistance" movement, jointly organized by this newspaper and hospitals such as Renhe, Shangxian, Baoli, Huisheng, and the Red Cross Society, has been well-received by all parties over the past two years, thanks to the full cooperation of the responsible authorities, doctors, and nurses of each hospital. Although the addresses of these hospitals are distributed in various districts of this city, the Shanghai West area is uniquely lacking, which has caused some regret for the poor pregnant women there. In order to remedy this deficiency, this newspaper has obtained the consent of the authorities of Ren'ai Hospital (west end of Zhongshan Park) at No. 891 Changning Road, and will begin to join the collaboration from today. After that, all poor pregnant women residing in the Shanghai West area can apply to stay in the hospital to give birth. The application method is the same as for the previous hospitals, i.e., first come to this newspaper for an interview to obtain an application form, fill it out according to the format, and then send it to this newspaper for review. Once approved, you can go to the designated collaborating hospital to give birth. Ren'ai Hospital is managed by Dr. Lu Kunhao, with spacious facilities and complete equipment. This participation in maternity assistance cooperation is truly a great boon for the readers of this newspaper.

### Excerpts from Reply Letters Received

(1) Letter from the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau:

Your letter has been approved. After investigation, it was found that the driver who caused the accident, Li Shifu, belonged to the 14th Truck Regiment. After the accident, his colleague Mei Changyi was asked to go to the police station of the North Railway Station Branch to inquire. At that time, he also paid 45 yuan for the injured person's medical expenses, and then successively paid 50 yuan and 100 yuan, totaling 195 yuan, before stopping. However, the medical expenses are still quite large. Now that the injured person has recovered, the hospital needs to recover the medical expenses, but the injured person has no money to pay, hence this action. After Yu Shide was injured, the criminal part of the case against the driver who caused the accident has already been withdrawn and not pursued. Furthermore, the driver has paid three times for the medical expenses. Now it only involves the civil part." Correspondingly, please note for your reference!

### Writer Xiao Jun Gets a Cold Shoulder: An Exposure of "Freedom of Speech in the News"

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper Zheng Zhiang

[Our Hong Kong, 14th Dispatch] In the "Liberated Areas," all soldiers, members of the bourgeoisie, and intellectuals are liable to be purged and struggled against. This is a fact that everyone clearly recognizes. Not only that, but even so-called "fellow travelers" are ruthlessly attacked. Recently, a wave of purging has risen again in the Northeast and Hong Kong regarding the literary writer Xiao Jun (also known as Tian Jun). Cultural figures everywhere are eager to know the inside story of the purge. Therefore, the reporter is willing to use the space of this newspaper's correspondence section to give readers a detailed report.

First, let's explain what kind of writer Xiao Jun is. He is one of the so-called "Northeast writers" in the ranks of the leftist writers. He has written many short and long stories, of which "Village in August" is the most famous. And his rise to fame should be attributed to Lu Xun, because at that time, "Village in August" had not been recognized by the literary world, nor could it find a publishing opportunity. Xiao Jun, being sensitive, immediately consulted Lu Xun, hoping to gain the favor of publishers through his publicity. As a result, Lu Xun agreed to him, wrote a flattering preface to his "Village in August," and compiled it into the "Slave Series," appearing in a brand new posture. Once the book was published, the literary world followed suit with enthusiastic praise, and Xiao Jun's status as a famous writer was solidified from then on.

During the Anti-Japanese War, Xiao Jun evacuated from Shanghai to Chongqing, and then transferred from Chongqing to Yan'an. Last year, he went to Harbin and published a weekly called "Cultural News." In the "Cultural News" published on the day of the "August 15th" celebration of the surrender of the Japanese invaders in the Northeast, he harbored a deep sense of awareness and saw more clearly than others what the Soviet Union had done in the Northeast. Therefore, he took up his huge writing brush and indirectly stated that the Soviet Union was a red imperialist. This cry greatly angered the authorities in the Northeast Liberated Area, who believed that since Xiao Jun had come to the Liberated Area, he should not say such "strange things." Since he had said "strange things," it proved that he was in league with the "anti-Soviet, anti-communist Kuomintang reactionaries." They had to teach him a lesson, especially by encircling and suppressing him, believing that only by doing so could Xiao Jun be corrected and, at the same time, give the masses an opportunity for public education. Their central idea was nothing more than a formulaic theory, saying: "We know that only the anti-Soviet, anti-communist Kuomintang reactionaries deceitfully say that imperialism has 'red' and 'white' colors, and falsely accuse the Soviet Union of being 'red imperialism.'"

This is another way of expressing the same theory. They said in unison: "Why don't you, Xiao Jun, make any flattering expressions to the Soviet Red Army? The Soviet Red Army is the only foreign army that helps the People's Liberation Army! Not only do you not flatter it, but you also satirize it. What is your purpose?"

On the same day, Xiao Jun published an article in "Cultural News" writing about several Chinese children watching Russians drink tea in front of a Russian's house. The Russians didn't let them watch and wanted to drive them away. So, "It is impolite not to reciprocate," the Chinese children threw a stone in and hit the Russian old woman, who screamed incessantly.

In essence, this sketch shows the tenacious resistance of Chinese children, but the "comrades" in the "Liberated Area" believe that "this is a vicious piece of literature that provokes hatred between the Chinese and Soviet nations!" Just imagine: Chinese children have become champions of "provoking hatred between the Chinese and Soviet nations." Isn't that strange enough?

Xiao Jun is a writer with a national conscience, as can be seen from another essay, "Remembering the Past and Present." "Remembering the Past and Present" was also published in the same day's "Cultural News." The full text includes two sets of old-style poems, with a short preface explaining that this round of the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is a war of brothers fighting within the walls, therefore, he believes that "it is impossible not to be saddened by the fratricide!" The original text of Xiao Jun is recorded as follows:

"I know that the blood of the Chinese people will continue to flow in large quantities, but remembering the past and present, it is impossible to avoid feeling sad! It is impossible not to be saddened by the fratricide!"

In the "Preface" to "Feeling After Hearing of Victory," Xiao Jun said:

"The initial transmission of the news of victory was like a dream, as if sad and happy, as if fearful and worried, with all emotions intertwined, making it difficult to laugh or cry. Tracing back to the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, how much blood of the people's heroes was spent to obtain this 'initial fruit.' It is a pity that the enemy's atmosphere is not yet fully quelled, and the fratricide is boiling! Looking to the past and looking to the future, how can one not be worried and fearful!"

Xiao Jun has always maintained the same attitude. He is unwilling to blindly follow the Communist Party and regard the fratricide as a "war of the people against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism." Instead, he regards the Kuomintang and the Communist Party as a pair of "brothers from the same root." Therefore, Xiao Jun was not delighted when he heard the news of the "Liberation Army's" victory, but could not help but feel sad, fearful, and even moved to tears. This is an honest expression of the writer's true attitude, but the "comrades" around him falsely accused him of "posing, with a hypocritical humanitarian face, completely beneficial to the enemy and harmful to the people's liberation cause."

The "Life News," hosted by Song Zhi of and several other writers, became the slaughterhouse for encircling and suppressing Xiao Jun. They resolutely wanted Xiao Jun to study hard and transform himself. This struggle lasted for more than two months, but Xiao Jun always insisted on his position and did not yield. Therefore, all kinds of labels such as "extreme individualist," "Trotskyist," "anti-Soviet, anti-people" were added to Xiao Jun's head. They unanimously attacked: Xiao Jun has a sense of superiority as a writer, and he is dissatisfied, so he complains and says strange things. In fact, as we see it, Xiao Jun holds a consistent and honest attitude and opposes any pretense and labels!

### National Bank Restricts Withdrawal of Next-Day Deposits by Banks and Firms: Unprecedented Shortage of Cash in the Market, Discount Reaches as High as 10% to 15%

[Our Report] After the cyclical rise in prices, the supply of cash has been insufficient for a week. Yesterday, the supply of cash from the Central Bank was limited, and the cash shortage in the market was unprecedented. The discount on bills of exchange has reached as high as 10% to 15%. For the past two days, the counter and back office of the cashier department of the Central Bank have been crowded with personnel from various banks and firms negotiating the withdrawal of cash. Even as late as 8 or 9 p.m., the congestion had not subsided slightly. The banking and money industry in this city believed that since various banks and firms had surplus funds deposited in the National Bank for next-day withdrawal, there should be no restrictions. Therefore, representatives were sent to the National Bank for negotiations a few days ago. As a result, the National Bank has agreed that if banks and firms have surplus funds deposited in the National Bank for the next day, each bank will be limited to withdrawing 2 million yuan in cash per day. However, yesterday, due to the shortage of cash reserves in the National Bank and the unrestricted demand caused by the soaring prices, the cash withdrawal limit was changed again, stipulating that for every one million yuan in surplus funds deposited by banks and firms for the next day, they can withdraw 100,000 yuan in cash. With the issuance of this restriction, the cash supply of various banks and firms was suddenly reduced. It is said that even large banks such as the Bank of Communications only received 500,000 yuan yesterday. Therefore, the payment to customers by various banks and firms was also greatly restricted, resulting in an unprecedented shortage of cash turnover in the market. Those in urgent need of cash did not hesitate to discount their bills at high prices, resulting in an unprecedentedly high discount rate after the issuance of the gold yuan.

According to analysis by various related parties, the reasons for the cash crunch are nothing more than the following: (1) The trend of cyclical price increases has already exceeded the cash production rate of the printing press. Especially after the cyclical rise in prices, the amount of cash in circulation is even more insufficient. (2) The National Bank's Issuing Bureau prioritizes the supply of military pay and allowances. This huge amount of military pay must be regularly transported to various places in large amounts of cash for distribution. (3) These days are the period for various industries to pay salaries in the middle of the month, and the need for cash is extremely urgent. (4) The exchange rate difference in various parts of South China is close to half, while the cash discount in various parts of Southwest China, such as Chengdu and Chongqing, is surprisingly high. Cash in this city is constantly being collected and transported out for arbitrage. Due to these factors, the cash crunch is becoming increasingly acute.

### Easy Money, Tight Cash: Large Denomination Notes Flowing Outward

[Our Report] Yesterday, the money market was flooded all day long. The National Treasury had a huge amount of disbursements, foreign exchange remittances were constantly arriving, and the National Bank did not sell cotton yarn this week. The amount of gold allocated was also limited, so there was no hope of tightening the money supply. The daily interest rate has hovered between 60 and 65 yuan.

Yesterday, the surplus of the National Bank and its branches was over 1.44 billion yuan, the surplus of foreign banks was over 1.04 billion yuan, the net inflow of large exchanges was over 1.21 billion yuan, and the net inflow of small exchanges was over 1.27 billion yuan.

[Our Report] Yesterday, a related official from the National Bank told reporters: The bank's issuance of banknotes has been handled as usual these days, without any changes. In addition to the factors of military disbursements and cyclical salary payments, the shortage of cash in the market may also be due to artificial arbitrage and transportation to other places for profit. He cited an example to illustrate this, saying that the National Bank has issued several billion yuan of thousand-yuan notes in this city, but none have been seen circulating in the market, which shows that people must be taking them out for arbitrage. However, he believes that the current cash crunch is helpful in stabilizing prices.

### Gold Prices Rising Steadily

[Our Report] Gold prices continued to rise yesterday, both in the morning and afternoon, and the market sentiment was excellent. There was loose money in the market, and dealers were extremely flush with funds. New players were active, and the trend climbed to new peaks. However, most people were still concerned, and the price would pull back after rising, but then rise again after pulling back. The market is still taking a steady upward trend. The morning opening continued the bullish sentiment from the previous night, and people were quite confident. The initial opening was as high as 425 to 430. After opening, it rose to 427 to 430. After the high, sellers who had floated orders overnight sold, and the market immediately softened, with the low at 422 to 425. After the low, people continued to see new highs, and aggressive buying was frequent on the trading floor, pushing the price back up to 427 to 430. After rising, selling pressure started again, continuing down slightly to 423 to 426. The market then hovered between 425 and 428. After 11 o'clock, it broke through the 430 barrier, reaching 432 to 435. However, the bulls did not dare to speculate openly, still wary of the Central Bank's selling. Near noon, it reached as high as 435 to 438, with the highest reaching 436 to 439, then dropping slightly again to 431 to 434. It finally closed at 432 to 435 at noon. The outside market was as high as 437 to 440. In the afternoon, market sentiment became even more bullish. Contrary to expectations, the Central Bank did not take any action in the morning session. It was also heard that the jewelry stores' allocation price was 430,000, which also increased with the market, and people became more bullish. The initial opening was 468 to 471, and then rose to 475 to 478. After the high, it once pulled back slightly to 471 to 474. Finally, it still rose to 473 to 476, closing at 481 to 484 in the evening, with a very strong upward trend.

The morning opening for U.S. dollars was 8,500 yuan to 8,600 yuan, based on the trend of gold. The afternoon closing in the morning session was 8,650 yuan to 8,700 yuan. The opening in the afternoon session was 9,370 yuan to 9,420 yuan, and the evening closing was 9,620 yuan to 9,670 yuan.

### Hong Kong Dollar Exchange Rate Shrinks Again

The opening price for the Hong Kong dollar this morning was 54 cents per thousand yuan, compared to the previous night's close of 59 cents. The opening price for the gold yuan this morning was 97 cents per thousand yuan, compared to the previous night's close of 99 cents. The opening price for Hong Kong gold this morning was 308.75 yuan per Hong Kong tael, compared to the previous close of 306.75 yuan. The opening price for telegraphic transfers of U.S. dollars this morning was 5.23 yuan, compared to the previous night's current price. The opening price for forward U.S. dollars this morning was 5.21 yuan, compared to the same price as the previous night. The opening price for U.S. dollar banknotes this morning was 5.19 yuan, compared to the previous close of 5.18 yuan.

### National Bank Continues to Allocate Original Gold

[Our Report] The National Bank continued to allocate original gold to the jewelry industry yesterday. However, the application time in the morning was extended to 12 noon. The applications from various jewelry stores reached approximately 1,000 taels. The National Bank's opening price was 430,000 yuan per tael, and all applications were allocated, with a deadline for settlement and clearance by 1 pm.

Furthermore, the person in charge of the National Bank's Business Bureau told reporters yesterday that the National Bank had continued to sell original gold to the jewelry industry and had also sold approximately 10,000 taels secretly in the market. However, when asked of the members of the gold industry, they could not confirm this. They all said that small-scale sales by the National Bank might have occurred yesterday, but they had not heard of any sales reaching 10,000 taels.

### Silk Prices Rise Again

Yesterday, the upward trend in the raw silk market continued strongly. The price of gold outside the industry repeatedly reached new peaks. Credit within the industry was loose and abundant, and interest rates offered by floating individual investors were not very attractive, leading to increased demand for raw silk.

In the morning, at the No. 120 Tianqiao (overpass), due to excessive liquidity, brokers supported the market and quoted 2.1 million for spot goods, opening at a high price. After the opening, news arrived that gold prices had fallen from 430 to 425, causing market sentiment to weaken and demand to decrease. Brokers were also hesitant to support the market, and the price gradually decreased to 2.05 million. The market ultimately closed at 2.065 million yuan, with the overnight position at 2.195 million yuan. It is expected that the market will remain strong due to favorable gold prices, but weak sales may cause the market to rise only slightly.

Raw silk foreign exchange certificates continued to rise, and the market was brisk. Credit in the market was extremely loose, and interest rates were low. Brokers, seeing that the cost of holding goods was not as high as in previous days, were less inclined to sell. Premium silk opened at 2.9 million yuan, once reaching a high of 3.05 million, and closed at 3.07 million. In the afternoon, prices were quoted slightly higher, but no official transactions were made.

In the morning, due to the abundance of liquidity, the prices of silk fabrics opened high across the board. New Asia quoted 1,485,000 yuan, and Dazheng quoted 1.48 million. After the quotations, demand was strong, and the market gradually rose, once reaching 1,505,000 yuan and 1.51 million. However, due to the sharp drop in Chinese stocks and news that the cotton cloth market was mediocre, prices slightly decreased. The market closed at 1.49 million and 1,485,000 yuan in the afternoon. No quotations were heard in the afternoon.

### Shift of Idle Funds within the Industry, Weak Performance of Chinese Stocks

[Reported by this newspaper] The Chinese stock market was very weak yesterday. Pressure from outside the industry has eased, and idle funds within the industry have shifted to other sectors. The entire market process was quite bleak. The peak of each stock was fleeting, and large amounts of money were moved out by firms and bureaus, changing credit from loose to excessive. However, due to poor market sentiment, short positions were more numerous than long positions, and the market continued to show weakness. In the morning, Yongsheng Yarn rose because of extremely abundant liquidity and a sharp drop in overnight interest rates. The market had an average daily interest rate of 60 yuan, and many floating short positions were eager to buy, pushing the market up. The market opened at 6.8 yuan, and brokers strongly supported it, covering overnight short positions and pushing the market up to 7.02 yuan. However, banks and gold firms aggressively sold, causing the price to fall to 6.88 yuan. After the fall, retail investors bought again, pushing the price up to 6.96 yuan. Securities firms switched from long to short positions, constantly applying selling pressure, and the price quickly declined, hovering around 6.58 and 6.61 yuan. Afterwards, credit changed from loose to excessive, and the gold market continued to rise, causing brokers to shift their focus, selling stocks and buying gold. The stock market suffered a complete collapse, closing in the afternoon at a low of 6.41 yuan.

The performance of small and medium-sized stocks was still stable in the morning, and retail investors continued to buy, causing each stock to open at a high price. However, due to pressure on Yongsheng Yarn, the market ultimately weakened. Meiya opened at 2.1 yuan, close to the limit. Xinguang secretly supported the market repeatedly, and the trend was initially high but later weak. Xinhe, Jingfu, and Qinxing opened relatively flat in the morning, but all fell back in the afternoon. The remaining stocks were initially flat but later softened. The total daily transaction volume was 4,658 million shares.

Foreign Stocks and Gold Prices Rise

Foreign stocks rose yesterday due to the shift of foreign exchange to the securities market and abundant credit in the market. Many industries had numerous long positions, and there were reports of large outflows on the same day, leading to high market sentiment and increased demand. Each stock rose significantly. Jardine Matheson traded at 47,000 yuan and 49,000 yuan, an increase of 20%. Ewo Silk traded at 13,100 yuan and 13,300 yuan, also an increase of 500 yuan. Other stocks rose across the board.

The official price of gold rose, demand in the market increased, and the price of gold outside the industry soared. Market sentiment was high, and the abundance of credit further boosted demand. The market opened at 223,000 yuan, once reaching a high of 237,600 yuan. After the high, there were reports of slightly lower gold prices, causing the market to fall slightly to 223,000 yuan. The market closed in the afternoon at 237,600 yuan, reaching the limit.

### Rice Prices Soar, Special Japonica Rice at 46,000 Yuan

Due to loose credit, rice prices continued to rise. Market sentiment was very strong at the opening, and prices were raised by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. However, rice shops were not eager to buy, and sales were sluggish. Prices gradually fell back in the middle of the day. In the northern market, white rice was 44,000 yuan, up 2,500 yuan, and thin rice was up 2,000 yuan, also at 44,000 yuan. In the southern market, white rice and early thin rice each rose by 1,500 to 2,000 yuan. Sheep indica rice was 44,000 yuan, and high-quality white rice was scarce, with prices opening at 47,500 yuan. Special japonica rice in the northern market reached 46,000 yuan. The total amount of rice arriving in the two markets yesterday was 6,070 shi.

Cooking Oil

Prices rose without end. Due to loose credit, rice prices rose first, and market sentiment was strong. Sellers raised prices, and each type of oil rose by 10,000 yuan at the opening. Later, retail investors actively bought, and prices rose again. Rapeseed oil opened at 166,000 yuan and later rose to 170,000 yuan. Soybean oil closed at 175,000 yuan, each rising by 15,000 yuan, or about 10%. A barrel of refined rapeseed oil broke the 200,000 yuan mark, reaching 215,000 yuan, an increase of 20,000 yuan. Sesame oil in small carts rose by 10,000 yuan, and soybean cake rose in tandem by 1,000 yuan.

Flour

The market remained strong. At the opening, with the support of loose credit, old brands continued to rise by 1,000 yuan, and the "warship" brand once closely approached the 18,000 yuan mark. Later, rumors persisted, and northern dealers maintained a wait-and-see attitude. The stock market rose sharply and then plummeted, causing market sentiment to be uneasy. Prices weakened across the board at the close. After the close, gold prices remained high, and market sentiment was quite strong. Dealers strongly supported the market, and the market showed strength again. Old brands quoted 18,400 yuan, and the "warship" brand traded at 17,680 yuan.

Grains

Prices rose and fell unevenly. Yellow soybeans generally rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Bean sauce and liquor dealers had demand, and oil factories also had an appetite. Vehicle soybeans traded at a high of 35,000 yuan. Raw peanuts had more supply than demand, and prices fell by 5,000 yuan. Sesame and corn had good sales in the local market, and prices rose. Mung beans were viewed with caution by Qinggang, and the market turned flat. Red beans had sluggish sales and were slightly downstream.

### Cotton Yarn Supply and Demand Balanced, Market Sentiment Firm in the Cloth Market

The trend in cotton yarn prices did not deviate from a stable pattern, and the range of price fluctuations was very narrow. With no external positive or negative stimulus, speculators had no intention of entering or leaving the market. Sales in the local market and by Guangdong dealers were not sluggish, but there were also many retail sellers, resulting in a balanced supply and demand in the market.

42-count Blue Phoenix opened outside the 3 million yuan mark. Many retail investors sold at high prices, and the price fell back to 2.95 million yuan at the close, a rise of 120,000 yuan from the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose by 170,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon gradually fell from 1.96 million yuan to 1.93 million yuan at the close, a final rise of 100,000 yuan.

21-count Double Horse spot goods opened at 1.55 million yuan. The price was once raised to 1.57 million yuan, but later fell back to 1.555 million yuan at the afternoon close, a rise of 110,000 yuan. Factory orders ultimately leveled with spot goods, and 20-count Double Horse rose by 90,000 yuan. Other brands, such as Golden City and Heavenly Maiden, also rose by 50,000 to 80,000 yuan. All grades of 16-count and below were brisk.

The cloth market continued to reach new highs, the market was very stable, and market sentiment remained firm. Sellers were unwilling to sell at these low prices, so prices rose at the opening. However, buyer's from other regions were cautious and did not step forward, so there were not many transactions.

Longtou fine cloth gradually rose from 64,000 yuan to 66,000 yuan, and closed at 65,000 yuan in the afternoon, a final rise of 6,000 yuan. Labatong fine cloth was 59,500 yuan, a rise of 5,500 yuan. In addition, Da Shuanglong and Longtou B fine cloth both rose by about 5,000 yuan.

Sijunzi yuan bi ji opened at 62,400 yuan and was immediately sold downstream, falling to a low of 60,900 yuan. The market improved again near noon, and closed at 61,900 yuan, a rise of 5,500 yuan. Jinlian Miaowu yuan bi ji rose to 47,000 yuan. Prices for 190 shilin and poplin fabrics from factories were all increased by more than 10%. The trend was even stronger in the afternoon. It was reported that Longtou fine cloth was quoted at 70,000 yuan and Sijunzi yuan bi ji at 66,000 yuan outside the market.

### The Gold Control Bureau Sends Ten Audit Teams to Strictly Inspect the Business of Banks and Firms

It is reported that the audit focused not only on general business trends but also paid close attention to position transfers and bounced checks.

### Audit Office of the National Bank Publishes Bank and Firm Deposit Figures for January

### Strolling Through the Market, Observing the Spectators

The Scarcity of Cash Creates a Path to Wealth,  
A Storm Brewing Can End Lives,  
The Gold Market is Makeshift,  
A Tempest Looms for the Rice and Grain Industry.

Treading through various markets, every market is soaring.

Ordinary people are speechless in the face of soaring prices, but those in the industry are still shaking their heads and sighing, feeling that even the interest has not risen.

Recently, one often hears of the bad news of "collapses." Yesterday, what department store, what rubber factory, what cigarette shop, what what, all had news of collapses. Upon detailed inquiry, every one was dragged down by high interest rates.

High interest rates: causing ordinary people to be speechless, causing industry and commerce to collapse; causing harm in this way, yet the financial authorities are congratulating themselves on their accomplishment!

Every industry is experiencing a scarcity of cash, some say due to credit inflation, others say due to excessive price increases. Because both exist simultaneously, the situation becomes increasingly severe.

The need for large banknotes is again a unanimous request.

The financial authorities who "respect public opinion" will soon show it in fact.

This cash scarcity is truly harming the working class, because salaries are mostly paid by check, and it is also harming the city's residents, because one cannot buy vegetables every day without cash.

The greater the harm, the more it creates huge profits for certain individuals. Currently, a one million yuan check can only be converted into 880,000 yuan in cash, truly a hard blow!

Those who control cash are the special individuals who monopolize the huge profits from cash. For these people, it can truly be said that there is a path to wealth.

For various reasons, the gold and silver market must be opened. For example, right now, it is not easy to knock in large quantities of silver dollars.

Again, for various reasons, restoring the gold exchange market is as difficult as climbing to the heavens. For example, paying margin is difficult for merchants; not paying is difficult for the authorities.

For these and other reasons, a makeshift tea party-style gold and silver market has emerged.

Currently, it is already in a period of official-merchant consultation and active preparation.

Will the preparatory work have an impact on the gold and silver market? My answer is, of course, there will be, and it will be many, great, and important.

For example, if I have membership qualifications, I will of course stir up my spirits and work hard at it after the market opens. Then I must have some gold and silver in hand, so there is a need to drag in a little more as soon as possible.

Because I think this way, other members think this way as well. Since people share the same mind and reason, gold and silver are of course viewed favorably at the moment.

Starting yesterday, many pieces of news detrimental to the people's food have emerged, such as the Philippines borrowing rice from China, which the authorities have already agreed to; the city's rice rationing can barely be maintained until the end of June, without interruption.

Those involved in these news events are all active at the same time, giving people a signal that a great storm is coming to the rice market.

Damn, the common people are truly doomed!

### Hua Lian Dominates, Hui Li Plays the Pipa, 64 to 34 With No Chance to Bargain

[Reported by this newspaper] In last night's basketball league, the Tai City champion Hua Lian defeated Hui Li by a score of 64 to 34, continuing its leading position in the league. At halftime, Hui Li trailed 24 to 18. Hua Lian led throughout, and Hui Li struggled under heavy pressure. Because last night's Encars vs. McInnes game was rescheduled, the first game started at 6:30 p.m., with the Kang team winning a big victory over the West Qing Lan team, 56 to 29, with Kang leading by four points at halftime, 20 to 16. The gymnasium was quite lively last night, with over two thousand fans, all supporters of both sides.

Hua Lian's star player, Wu Chengzhang, did not play last night because he had some "small relationship" with Hui Li and was also a coach for Hui Li. Initially, both sides were flustered, "playing the pipa and blocking each other," with Hui Li in a particularly miserable state, only managing to score nine points from free throws. However, after ten minutes, the situation completely changed, and the two teams were once in a stalemate. This stalemate did not last long, and Hua Lian's frenzied attacks led to a score difference of one to two at halftime. After the break, Hui Li took on the posture of a trapped beast, knowing that the overall situation was lost but continuing to work hard. Hua Lian worked hard last night, denying Hui Li any opportunity to avenge their defeat in the second round. Hui Li's Fu Haitang, Yongfang, and others struggled throughout, Cao Zhiji had bad luck with the ball, and although Wei Qikun did not score, he saved many dangerous balls under the basket in the first half.

The five players for Hui Li were Wang Yongfang, Cao Zhiji, Tian Fuhai, Ye Yunshan, and Wei Qikun. The players who took the court for Hua Lian were Chuan Jinsheng, Liu Fushan, Li Zhenzhong, Bao Songyuan, and Zhang Liangxiong. Hua Lian's A Chuan's initial attacks were ineffective, and later Bao and Fu each made a free throw, making it 2 to 0. Hui Li then paused. Bao scored another point, and Hui Li's Wang Yongfang gritted his teeth and shot, and the scoreboard also showed two points. This could be called the "era of double panic," with Hua Lian's free throws and Hui Li's under-the-basket shots all "playing the pipa." It was not easy for Bao and Zhang to add two points, making it 5 to 2. Xu Shuyuan replaced Wei, and within eight minutes, Hui Li's Wang Ye scored two free throws again, making it 7 to 4.

Hui Li, with Wang Yongfang's performance, changed the situation in an instant, overtaking with a score of 8 to 7. Hua Lian's Jia Zhou replaced Liangxiong, and Jin Sheng's one point made it 8 all. Hui Li's Xu Shuyuan was leading by one point, but Hua Lian's soldiers used their lives, launching strange balls repeatedly, making it 15 to 11. Hui Li's Wei and Xu returned to their original positions, but soon it was 17 to 11. From then on, it was all Hua Lian's world, and the balls went in one by one, making it 28 to 14 at halftime.

In the second half, Hui Li's Fu Hai and Yunshan seemed to echo each other, but Songyuan's "light touches" made it difficult for Hui Li to stand out. With the score at 45 to 28, Liangxiong replaced Zhenzhong, and Xiaole also performed well, making it 48 to 30. Li Hanting replaced Fu Jinsheng, and Yongfang and Fuhai were still fighting like trapped beasts. At 50 to 34, Fuhai committed his fifth foul, and Chen Zhengmiao entered the battle. Soon after, Shuyuan replaced Yunshan, and Hui Li finally entered a state of "everyone fighting for themselves." Hua Lian ultimately won a great victory by 64 to 34.

### Kang Team Easily Defeats West Qing Lu

In the second division A match between West Qing Lan and Kang Team, the score was 20 to 16 at halftime. The West Qing Lan team's players had gold, brown, gray, and black hair, a riot of colors that showed that they were an international mixed team. In the second half, the small Russian's internal defense was too empty. Constantly changing the line did not have the effect. Kang Team ultimately won by a score of 56 to 29.

### Women's Basketball Technique

— By Qi Gongshu

Method B is used to defend against the opponent's special offensive tactics. The opponent's center is a tall and cumbersome player who stands under the basket like a high pillar. To deal with this method, the center back must select a tall and long-legged player to serve as the defender, controlling a small area under the basket. At the same time, the defender must intercept the opponent's passes and watch over the opponent's center who plays the role of the "pillar." Her task is extremely heavy. In addition to the above duties, she must also pay attention to the dynamics of another area. If the opponent's forward breaks through another area and rushes towards the basket, the center back should intercept the enemy forward within a possible range and be able to take the lead to slow down the forward's advance and prevent her from shooting and passing the ball to the center.

The previous two zone defense systems, which involve movement in zones, are shaped by the opponent's forward's movements. Now, we are studying how to determine the zone that should be defended based on the ball's location. It is possible to designate the zone that should be defended, and each guard still needs to be agile, have a tacit understanding of contact with the other two guards, and have the alertness to adapt to circumstances. Below are four simple basic moving zone defense methods that are relatively easy to learn and use. This moving zone defense zone is established based on the following principles: the area in which the defender stands strategically is close to the basket, and all scoring areas are under the guard's supervision. This defense system is divided into three lines of defense. If an attacker can break through the first line of defense, she still needs to continue to break through the second line of defense before she can rush to the basket, because when the attacker breaks through the front first line of defense, the guards on the rear two lines will immediately intercept her.

When taking defense, although it may be designated to defend the zone should not be a dull fixed, the zone is to see the movement of the ball in the movement of its formation.

Defensive guards each stand in strategically important areas, as mentioned above. When the opponent's center receives the ball in the center circle and launches an offensive, the three guards should be positioned in a triangular formation, with the center back standing in front of the free throw line and the left and right backs watching over the opponent's two forwards in front of the apex.

Figure 1: The imaginary point of the ball field slows down the area where separate guards attack and intercept the ball. If the opponent's center launches an offensive in China and passes the ball to her left or right forward, when the ball reaches that area, the guard in that area will come out to meet the enemy forward, watching over her until she has passed the ball to someone else. Each guard does not need to care about the movements of other enemy forwards, as long as she sees the ball in the forward's hand, she must come forward to watch over her. (To be continued 3)

### SPORTS WORLD: Hong Kong Island Lawn Tennis Singles - Chinese Players Dominate the Quarterfinals - Hsu Wei-pei and Yeh Kuan-hsiung Win Easily - Hsu Run-pei and Liang Chih-chi Perform Excellently

[Hong Kong Airmail News] The tennis tournament organized by the Hong Kong Cricket Club saw lively scenes on the 16th, as fans flocked to watch the final players in the singles competition vie for a place in the semifinals. All four courts were packed with spectators. In the end, Yeh Kuan-hsiung, Hsu Run-pei, Liang Chih-chi, and Hsu Wei-pei secured their spots in the semifinals. In the upcoming matches to determine the finalists, Yeh Kuan-hsiung will face Hsu Run-pei, and Liang Chih-chi will compete against Hsu Wei-pei.

These four matches, even at the quarterfinal stage, were unexpectedly uneventful. The competition began at 5:15 PM and concluded with the last match (Chih-chi vs. Sikland) at only 5:55 PM. In other words, the longest match lasted only forty minutes. The match results are as follows:

Court 1: Yeh Kuan-hsiung vs. Tsai Yung-shan. This match was expected to be a battle. Yeh played with exceptional vigor yesterday, consistently taking the initiative with long shots followed by short drop shots, exhausting Tsai. With such a performance, Yeh can undoubtedly capture the championship in this tournament.

The match consisted of two sets. In the first set, Yeh started by winning the first five games. Tsai then managed to win one game, making the score 1-5. Yeh then won the first set 6-1. In the second set, Yeh continued smoothly, winning 6-2.

Court 2: Liang Chih-chi vs. Sikland. Before the match, I noted that while Liang and Sikland's playing styles were somewhat similar, Liang consistently had accurate shots and powerful "cuts," while Sikland relied solely on hard hitting. Therefore, Liang had a slight advantage in terms of winning. Indeed, Liang defeated Sikland yesterday with scores of 6-2, 6-2. Such a significant margin of victory is undoubtedly a success for Liang.

Court 3: Li Wen-cheng vs. Hsu Wei-pei. Li's skills were not yet refined, allowing Hsu to maintain control of the match's outcome. In the first set, Hsu secured a clean sweep with a score of 6-0. In the second set, Li briefly took the lead at 2-1, but then faltered, allowing Hsu to win six consecutive games and ultimately lose the second set with a score of 2-6, resulting in his elimination.

Court 4: Run-pei vs. Ho-tang. Ho-tang managed to put up a fight in the first set, but in the second set, it was a one-sided affair. In the two sets, Run-pei narrowly won the first set 6-4, and then won the second set 6-2. Winning decisively.

### Da Xia Three Wins Out of Three - Pan Team Plays Public Transportation Today

The Da Xia football team eliminated Wanli with a score of 3-1 yesterday, securing a spot in the final of the Democratic Cup intermediate group. The final is scheduled for next Tuesday (March 22nd) at 4:00 PM against Yingguang to compete for the silver cup. All three goals for Da Xia were scored by Pang Mei-xiong, which can be considered a miracle. Wanli scored a consolation goal in the final minutes through Rong Zheng-ming. Da Xia has now won three out of three matches, making them strong contenders for the championship.

Today at 4:00 PM, the Pan Team will play Public Transportation at the South City Stadium in a repechage match. The referee is Yue Renxiao, and the linesmen are Ma Youyu and Yan Yougeng.

### Hong Kong Football Association Selects Squad for Interport Match Against the Philippines

[Hong Kong Airmail News] At 5:15 PM on the 16th, the Interport Match Subcommittee of the Hong Kong Football Association convened a meeting to select players for the upcoming Hong Kong-Philippines interport football match in Manila next month. The meeting was chaired by MacAlister Paiwo, and attendees included Huang Chia-chun, Li Han-kan, Captain Cheeseman, Auma, Kingkin, Keller, Honorary Secretary Su Kuo-hsing, Deputy Secretary Hsia Hsien, etc. The reason for selecting the squad so early is twofold: firstly, to ascertain how many of those selected are willing to travel with the team, and secondly, to address the potential delays in obtaining passports for the Chinese players, as the previous direct approach to the diplomatic commissioner in Hong Kong and Guangdong is no longer straightforward. Therefore, it is necessary to finalize the list early to avoid last-minute complications. Consequently, the selection not only includes more reserve players, but also divides them into special reserve players and reserve players. In other words, if a first-choice player is unable to travel, a special reserve player will be substituted first. Even if all the first-choice players are willing to travel, special reserve players will still be considered first. Only if there are still vacancies will other reserve players who have expressed a willingness to travel be considered. The selected list is as follows: As it is unknown who will be able to travel at the time, the captain has not yet been selected. However, the responsibility of team leader has been agreed upon by the committee members to be assigned to Auma, representing St. Joseph's.

(First Choice)

Yu Yao-te (South China)

Dosa (Navy) Hou Rong-sheng (South China)

Liu Song-sheng (South China) Li An-na (Joseph's) Zhang Chin-hai (South China)

Li Da-hui (Bus) Kia-neng (Hong Kong) Rafati (Navy) Zou Wen-chih (Bus) Sylvia (Joseph's)

(Special Reserve) Man Dachen (Army), Chi Li-qi (Army), Wu Lun (Hong Kong), Zhu Yongqiang (South China), Hsieh Chin-ho (South China)

(Reserve) Luo Xiu (Joseph's), Hsieh Chin-hong (South China), Jia Shi-di-lu (Joseph's), Luo Lan-shi (Navy), Kuo Ying-chi (Kitchee), Mei Wu (Hong Kong).

### Soviet Union's High Standard of Tennis - Impressions of a Hungarian Player's Visit to the Soviet Union

[Tass, Moscow, 16th] Hungarian tennis players arrived in Moscow two weeks ago at the invitation of the Sports and Exercise Committee under the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. They have had several practice matches with Soviet athletes.

The Hungarian players praised the high level of skill of the Soviet tennis players. They said: Soviet tennis players have a progressive style, and they excel at powerful serves, equally powerful forehand strokes, and excellent net play.

After a few more matches in Moscow, the Hungarian players will depart for Leningrad, where they will face the local team.

### US Congress Passes Proposal to Hold World Games in the United States

[US Information Service, Washington, 16th] The US Congress has passed a proposal and sent it to the White House for President Truman's signature, inviting the International Summer Stoke Committee to hold the 1956 Summer Stoke Games in Detroit, Michigan.

The fourteenth Summer Stoke Games, held in the UK last summer, achieved a high informal score. The last time this international games were held in the US was in 1932, in Los Angeles.

The Summer Stoke Committee will meet in Rome next month to discuss plans for the games to be held in Helsinki in 1952.

### Women's Basketball Circle

— Mei Jie

Although women's basketball in this city isn't experiencing a peak, it's also not in decline. This is evidenced by the championship won at the last National Games, which we should foster.

In terms of teams, there are always around five or six participating in the league, which is quite a lively scene. However, the Green Team consistently wins the championship, which is certainly a result of their hard work, but also indicates a lack of new stars emerging. This is because women often interrupt their playing careers due to marriage, which is an irreparable drawback.

As far as I know, the only recent expedition of a women's basketball team from this city was when the Green Team visited Stone City, which caused quite a sensation. There haven't been any others since. It is said that the Philippines are very interested in inviting our city's women's basketball team this spring. I wonder what obstacles are preventing this wonderful event from happening. To this day, there has been no news or inquiry. With Qian Xuchang's comprehensive abilities, I don't believe he couldn't orchestrate its success. Perhaps it's because basketball in this city is currently in a tense period, and they don't want to divert attention.

Speaking of the current process and situation, everyone can see clearly that the Green Team still firmly holds the top position. The newly formed Li Team is striving to compete and may snatch the second-place spot. The Xinghua team has good talent but seems to lack spirit. Their previous forfeit against the Green Team was unacceptable. Next would be the student army, John's, while the Li Team will likely remain in last place. Given this trend, I will now provide an overview of each team in order to modestly support women's basketball.

Discussing the Reasons for the Green Team's Continuous Victories

The Green Team is undoubtedly a heroine among women. As far as I know, since its formation, except for a defeat under men's rules against the Filipino Black and White team, they have been virtually invincible, maintaining a record of constant victory. They are truly a remarkable team.

In the past, I felt that the Green Team's strength was simply their superior individual skills. However, in this competition, I have seen even greater improvements in their tactics, so not only can we see them winning, but also giving a good performance. They give the audience a more impressive impression, and the Green Team should be seen as the pride of women's basketball.

As for why the Green Team has such a long history and improvement in skill, perhaps readers would like to know some of the reasons. According to what I know, there are several reasons:

(1) Harmony: Harmony means effective management. Xie Yiqin, the team manager, treats each player equally, always offering encouragement, which gives the players a sense of spiritual pleasure, so naturally everyone works hard. At the same time, they always win by a large margin, so after the game, everyone is happy and laughing. There is no blaming each other, as is inevitable with losing teams, so everyone's feelings only deepen and will not dissipate. This point of harmony is said to be a key element of a team's success.

(2) Training: The Green Team's spirit of training is admirable. They have set dates, and if you have something to do, you must formally request leave in advance, otherwise everyone will arrive, regardless of wind, frost, rain, or snow. Over the years, there has been no interruption, so today's success is certainly not accidental.

(3) Good Guidance: The Green Team has had three phases of guidance so far. The first, when the team was first established, was Qian Xuchang. Qian taught them entirely how to avoid the strong and attack the weak, winning by using their strengths against the other team's weaknesses. Later, Qian grew tired, and for a time, no one could be found, so the management, Xie, also took on the role. He specialized in discussing and researching with the players for progress and retreat. Recently, Kong Guangyi, who was hired, should be the third phase. Ah Kong really put in a lot of effort to guide the Green Team, to understand women's basketball, and added his wealth of experience. Recently, he has been able to keep up with the times, striving for excellence, so naturally the Green Team can add icing to the cake in three phases of obtaining guidance.

Speaking of tactics, my impression is that the current Green Team forwards understand and can execute feints, screens, and utilize skilled methods, plus accurate shooting. Therefore, the weaker defending force can only be trampled on. The defenders apply the exchange man-marking to a transformed, skillful, and appropriate level, which no other team can match.

Finally, in terms of individuals, the veterans Huang Mingyuan and Wang Weizhen have experience, brains, and skills that are superior. Wu Ailian shoots quickly, and Wu Meiyi is fierce. The newcomer Lu Weijun has momentum, and more worthy of introduction are Zhu Jinyun and Shi Zonglan. The latter has balanced strength, accurate shooting, running speed, and a beautiful posture. As for Zhu Jinyun, she is even more promising, with her elasticity surpassing the others, and she is 19 out of 10 times sure of getting the ball under the basket, and she shoots quickly, has a clear mind, and has flexible hand skills. All are excellent, and she is young, with a brilliant future. I have high hopes for Zhu and Shi!

### Musings on Nanjing Road

— Jiang Shangyu

(1)

The vendors on Nanjing Road, whether selling "Genuine Mercerized Cotton Dance Socks," "Hong Kong Soap," or "Customs Auction Sanitary Clothing," besides each having their own set of astonishing persuasive skills, also invariably have one or two, or even three or four, "customers" who are constantly picking and choosing.

People who have lived in Shanghai for a long time know that these "customers" are their own people, used to prop up the scene and attract real customers, because people's psychology is always to go where everyone else goes. Moreover, if you pay close attention, you can find that the fake customers who were next to the mercerized cotton sock stall in the morning will appear next to the soap or sanitary clothing stalls in the afternoon. It can be seen that they are also often making mutually beneficial exchanges.

Doing small business is like this, and so is doing the biggest business, like being an official. If you want to stand out, the first thing you have to do is find a group of people to praise you, and these people should preferably seem unrelated to you. If you say this often enough, then others will naturally believe it and truly think that you are quite reasonable.

If you tell a lie often enough, the people will believe it, this is the famous saying of the German propaganda king Goebbels. How many of the eminent gentlemen on the stage today did not come from such origins? And we, the people, because we have heard so many lies, and seen so many people buying them, we can't tell who is selling real mercerized cotton socks, and who is selling silk stockings that tear two big holes as soon as you put them on.

Standing in New World calling for rickshaws, those going to Henan Road all say "going east," and those going to Carter Road all say "going west."

But is Henan Road really going east, and is Carter Road really going west? Not necessarily. If you are standing on the Bund, Henan Road is going west, and if you are at Jing'an Temple, Carter Road is of course in the extreme east. So, the so-called "east" and "west" are just saying what you say from where you are standing.

If you think about it more esoterically, then even the relative nouns of "east" and "west" are difficult to exist. The earth is round, which is something everyone believes. Then, if you go west from New World, around the circle of the earth, wouldn't you still be able to reach the Bund? Then, should the Bund be said to be east of New World, or the extreme west?

There is a Western saying: The two poles meet. The extreme west is also east, and the extreme east is also west. East and west are like this, and so are left and right.

Therefore, today's world is so concerned about the division of left and right in thought, which is actually unnecessary. Because what is right at Jing'an Temple is left at the Bund. And from the perspective of the entire circle of the earth, the so-called left and right are just nouns that people have come up with to confuse themselves.

The more you divide "east" and "west," the more chaotic the direction becomes; the more nouns you create, the more chaotic the world becomes.

### Strange Marriage Customs in the Netherlands

— Fang Zhou

Although the Netherlands is a small country, the customs of its various regions are different, and some are quite peculiar. For example, in Stavoren, which has a population of nearly 10,000, the way young men and women get together is still stuck in the era of five hundred years ago. Compared carefully, it is almost the same as the marriage customs of the Li people of Hainan Island in our country.

If a young man in Stavoren falls in love with a local girl, he will take advantage of her going out and snatch the cloth sash tightly around her waist, in which her raincoat is placed. If she lets him snatch her raincoat, it means that she has acquiesced to his courtship. Then, on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings, he can go to her private room (which her father built for her next to the house), whistle for a while, and then climb through the window into the room and spend the night with her. Until she becomes pregnant, the two announce their engagement. But before the girl becomes pregnant, engagement is not allowed.

If the time for sneaking around passes for three and a half months, and the girl is still unable to get pregnant, her parents and friends will despise her and suspect her. Moreover, her lover, if he becomes tired of her, can put a straw man in front of her window at any time to declare his breakup with her.

On the contrary, if the girl becomes pregnant, and her lover changes his mind and refuses to get engaged to her, he will be severely punished by the local residents. A group of young people will catch him, whip him, and then tie him to the roof of a carriage and send him to the girl's house, and lock him in the pigsty to sleep and eat with the pigs, until he begs the girl for forgiveness and agrees to get engaged to her, then he can regain his freedom. Otherwise, he should not think about getting out of the pigsty.

Soon after the engagement, an engaged couple will hold a wedding ceremony in a public hall. After the wedding, the couple must live in separate rooms until the bride gives birth to her first child, and then they can start sleeping in the same bed.

### Travel Notes from Guangzhou

— Zhang Yiqu

Spring arrives, busy on both sides of Humen, peach blossoms bright, chrysanthemums yellow, I am now a newcomer to the south, I suspect even the heavens are in disarray. (In early spring, peaches and chrysanthemums bloom in Guangzhou, which Northerners find to be a strange sight.)

The ancient Pagoda of Six Banyan Trees emerges from the clouds, overlooking the southeast, there is still righteousness between heaven and earth, Huanghuagang and Baiyun Mountain. (Huanghuagang is where the seventy-two martyrs are buried, and Baiyun Mountain is where the martyrs of the anti-Japanese war in Guangdong are buried. I once went up the ancient pagoda of the Six Banyan Trees to look far away, and could see them clearly.)

Endless green climbs the window screen, red kapok blossoms fill the trees, don't ask about the news from Shanglin, now business is in the farmers' homes. (In spring, kapok blooms profusely, fiery red and dazzling.)

After drinking, I returned from the Hundred-Foot Tower, drunk, I drifted on a boat on the Lychee Bay, the Pearl River water smiled, the children were busy. (From "Haichiao Red House" on the Pearl River to "Lychee Bay," the boats come and go like weaving.)

### Hunan's Fish

— Yi Qun

A few days ago, this column published an article about "fish." After reading it, I thought of the fish in my hometown of Pingjiang, Hunan.

There are many ponds in my hometown. In Yizi, there must be one or even several ponds in front of or behind the house. Because there are so many ponds, it is not uncommon for children to fall in and drown. What are so many ponds used for? Besides paying attention to feng shui, washing clothes and raising fish are the two main functions.

The most common types of fish raised are two: one is grass carp, with large scales, thick body, coarse meat, and eats grass; small fish are placed in the pond in spring, and by the Mid-Autumn Festival in August, they weigh more than two catties. The other is silver carp, with fine scales, wide and flat body, and white color, and eats pig manure and grass carp manure; small fish are placed in the pond in spring, and by the Mid-Autumn Festival in August, they can weigh more than three catties. If these two types of fish are raised in the pond, grass and manure must be cut and poured in regularly.

If the fish are put into the pond for three or five years, silver carp can grow to ten or twenty catties, and grass carp can grow to thirty or forty catties, as long as a carrying pole.

In addition to grass carp and silver carp, a slightly rarer variety is the so-called "Pangtou," which is the same shape as silver carp, except that it has a particularly large head. Therefore, in my hometown, people with big heads are often given the nickname "Pangtou." Another type is the so-called "Qingzhu," which is probably a type of grass carp, shaped like grass carp but dark green in color, and is said to be very nourishing, and is best for people who have just recovered from a serious illness.

The above are the most common domestic fish, all raised in ponds. In addition, there are fish and shrimp everywhere in the small rivers. When the water rises, it is a good opportunity to catch fish. In the misty rain, wearing straw raincoats, spreading nets by the river, what is caught are all tumbling and jumping fish and shrimp. I have also experienced this clear interest. When the rain stops, the small river is even more suddenly crowded with people, some using nets to catch, and some reaching out into the cracks in the stones to touch. Enthusiastic people catch fish all day during the day, and also light pine firewood at night to catch.

Speaking of lighting pine firewood to catch fish, I also thought of loach in the rice fields. Loach are all caught using pine firewood at night. This kind of thing, the deliciousness of the taste, I think exceeds chicken meat. Insiders have a unique way of cooking, which is to first put the loach into a vegetable oil jar and let it drink its fill of vegetable oil, and then cook it in soup. The loach cooked in this way tastes indeed better.

According to rural customs, when inviting guests in the first month of the lunar calendar, there is usually a bowl of fish on the banquet, but it is often not eaten, but only placed there as a formality, because it is inconvenient to go to the pond to net fish in cold weather, and it is not easy to buy. Sometimes it is not even cooked, and a bowl of raw fish is placed there, perhaps to prevent those ignorant or joking guests from rashly starting to eat it.

Swimming Pool

A nouveau riche boasted to a friend about how magnificent his newly built villa was and how complete the equipment was. He said:

"Inside, there are three swimming pools, one with cold water, one with hot water, and one without water."

"The cold water and hot water ones don't need to be said," the friend said. "But what does the one without water mean?"

"Because," he replied, "I found that many of the friends who come don't know how to swim."

### The Story of Dice

— Mao Yi

Dice are one of the oldest and most common gambling tools. Remains of using two dice for gambling games have been found in ancient tombs in Egypt and the Far East. In ancient Greece, almost every banquet ended with a dice game. Their method of throwing was slightly different from that of the East. They used three dice, and the person who threw three sixes "ate the entire pot."

During the era when the Roman Empire was enjoying a life of indulgence and luxury, the favored sons of heaven, the Romans, were particularly fond of gambling. However, gambling was forbidden among the common people, so initially, only nobles used their "official" status to play dice games on a large scale. A recently discovered record shows that Emperor Augustus once threw a "supreme reality," winning the entire pot. Another great Roman general, Mark Antony, threw dice while stationed in Alexandria. The Roman tyrant Nero also liked to throw dice. Claudius I even wrote a book about dice gambling.

As a result, the gambling trend spread from the top down, and it became prevalent among the common people. Therefore, the authorities had to formulate special laws to prohibit anyone from gambling. Anyone whose house was found to be a gathering place for gambling would be mercilessly arrested and brought to the Roman court.

After the collapse of the Roman Empire, the gambling trend also declined. Later, in the Middle Ages, the gambling trend of throwing two dice revived and spread throughout Europe. Even the Crusaders liked to throw dice. Schools and guilds for throwing dice were even established one after another, a strange phenomenon unprecedented in history. Although the laws prohibiting gambling were extremely strict, the warriors and their ladies still threw dice as usual, and their gambling enthusiasm did not diminish.

Dice even helped white people seize land on the American continent. Native Americans loved to throw dice, and they often used large pieces of land as stakes in dice games with white people. The white people used their mathematical minds and rigged dice to always win, gaining large amounts of land without labor.

During World War II, American soldiers also loved to play dice games. According to an estimate by a certain military magazine, at least 95% of American soldiers were fond of throwing dice and did so frequently, even though the authorities strictly prohibited gambling, it was of no use.

### A History of Scalpers

— Jing Xin

Scalpers have become an occupation outside of the traditional 360 trades. There are scalpers in front of movie theaters, scalpers at banks exchanging gold and silver, and scalpers selling silver dollars on the street. Today's Shanghai, open your eyes and look, is entirely a world of scalpers. Some people doubt whether scalping can be considered an occupation? In fact, that is unnecessary. But looking at the current number of scalpers, the breadth of their distribution, it is estimated that there are tens of thousands of people who make a living as scalpers. Of course, they can occupy a place outside of the 360 trades. Although the objects they trade often change, this is just like nomadic peoples, living by water and grass, and it is precisely their changes during their growth process.

The scalper's business started with rice and daily necessities and rose to prominence by relying on surplus American materials. Now, it is very full-fledged. The emergence of scalpers dates back to the War of Resistance. At that time, Shanghai was reduced to an isolated island, and goods from the surrounding countryside could not be transported into the concessions. The most serious of these was food. The former Municipal Council authorities, in order to alleviate the food panic, specially transported foreign rice and distributed it to rice shops for sale at parity prices. At that time, there were no rice ration cards, so abuses abounded, and scalpers emerged in response. They squeezed into the long snake lines in front of the rice shops, bought rice, and resold it to people who could not mill rice or could not get rice. They relied on their ability to squeeze to make a living.

Once the scalper trend started, it grew day by day. Initially, it was only rice milling. Later, oil, sugar, cigarettes and other daily necessities were sold, and their traces could be found everywhere. Soon, the Municipal Council discovered their secrets and adopted the method of rationing certificates, cutting off the scalpers' livelihood, thus forcing them to transfer their positions. At that time, going out was a difficult task, and buying a ticket was the first problem. The scalpers found this gap and began to swarm towards train stations and wharves.

In times of war, everything is somewhat abnormal. In isolated Shanghai, although life was very difficult, many people held a carefree attitude, living one day at a time, seeking entertainment and enjoyment. The general nouveau riche were even more extravagant, indulging in pleasure to their heart's content. All entertainment venues were packed. Buying tickets at the theater door was like buying household rice, with very long lines. The scalpers' sharp eyes saw that there was another opportunity to take advantage of, so they expanded their territory, and the front of the theater also became their students' hangout.

After the victory, large quantities of surplus American materials poured in. These many goods, in addition to a small number being imported by formal commercial firms, were mostly brought in privately by warships or merchant ships. They were eager to dispose of them. Driven by profit, the scalpers would certainly not give up. Thus, selling American military supplies became their greatest livelihood, and running the docks was also their main job. The dense layers of stalls in the Zhu Bao San Road area were all rich grasslands for the scalpers. As for the price-limit period after "August 19th," it was the most glorious time for the scalpers. The streets and alleys were full of scalpers. This was already witnessed by all and need not be said more.

Economic and financial programs were changed again and again. From the collection and exchange of gold and silver to the exchange of gold and silver, the scalpers became even more active. Banks were to open at 9:00 am, but around the Bund, scalpers were already active there the night before. After the midnight curfew, they would ambush in the small alleys next door or on sampans in the Huangpu River. They also adopted a united front, and outsiders could not get a foothold. This time they harvested the most. Getting a registration form could allow them to enjoy ten and a half months. If it were not for the deaths caused by squeezing and trampling, if the Central Bank had continued to accept and exchange, many of them might have become wealthy landowners. Now, it is the era of silver dollars. The sound of "buying and selling big heads and small heads" can be heard from morning to night, but this is just picking up some dregs from the gold and silver exchange. Although the number of people seems vast, the profits are actually small. The golden age of scalpers seems to be over.
