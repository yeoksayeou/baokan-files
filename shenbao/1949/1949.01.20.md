### Principles for Peace Talks Decided by the Executive Yuan: Willing for Both Sides to Immediately and Unconditionally Cease Fire, and Each Appoint Representatives to Negotiate; Kuomintang Central Political Committee Decides at Special Meeting Today to Still Convene

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] At the Executive Yuan's administrative meeting on the morning of the 19th, Premier Sun Ke brought up the peace issue for discussion for the first time, and it was successfully passed. Mr. Sun first described the public's desire for peace reflected in various regions, and reported that the Legislative Yuan had twice sent letters to Mr. Sun offering suggestions, most of which called for peace. The Supervisory Committee and the National Assembly representatives were also of the same opinion. Therefore, given the general trend of public opinion, the Executive Yuan should promptly discuss this matter. Mr. Sun's proposal emphasized the following two principles: first, to be willing for both sides to unconditionally cease fire, and second, to request both sides to send representatives to conduct peace talks. After the proposal was made, the opinions of the committee members were solicited. After four hours of careful deliberation, it was finally passed. Among the committee members, no one fundamentally opposed the proposal. The Minister of Social Affairs, Gu Zhenggang, hoped that the wording would be handled carefully. Qingnian Party cabinet member Zuo Shunsheng, after Mr. Sun repeatedly solicited opposing opinions, stated in the meeting that the responsible cabinet is collectively responsible to the outside world, and the cabinet's decision should be the responsibility of all cabinet members. However, before a decision is made, anyone who cannot agree, that is, those who are unwilling to be jointly responsible, can first raise their concerns. Otherwise, once the case is decided, the entire cabinet should be responsible. After Zuo's statement, there were no other objections, and the following resolution was made: "In order to comply with the wishes of the people of the whole country and to seek the early realization of peace, the government solemnly expresses its willingness to first unconditionally cease fire with the Chinese Communist Party, and each designate representatives to conduct peace talks." It is noted that the case is based on the people's need for peace, not on the eight conditions proposed by Mao Zedong, so the key point is the premise of "unconditional" ceasefire. The passage of the case was known to the citizens of the capital at 3 p.m., and the response from all parties was very positive, hoping that the Communist Party would agree to a ceasefire as soon as possible and appoint representatives to jointly discuss a major peace plan.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Premier Sun Ke invited relevant individuals to the Lingyuan official residence at 4 p.m. on the 19th to discuss the implementation steps of the peace plan decided by the cabinet today. Those invited included Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhang Qun. The discussions lasted for several hours. There was also an important meeting at the presidential residence on the evening of the 19th. Some members of the Central Standing Committee in Nanjing, as well as Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, and others, were invited to study the decision of the Executive Yuan. The originally scheduled special meeting of the Central Political Committee on the morning of the 20th will still be held.

### If the Communist Party Controls China, It Will Be the United States' Greatest Failure

Walter Judd Criticizes China Policy

[United Press, Washington, 19th] Republican Congressman Walter Judd of the House Foreign Affairs Committee told reporters on the 19th that if the Communist Party controls China, it will be the greatest failure of the United States in the 170 years since its independence. This failure is far more serious than the Pearl Harbor incident. Pearl Harbor could be repaired, but the failure in China cannot be compensated for. Even when the Communist army sweeps across the entire China, the State Department may not change its China policy, but if the policy is changed now, actively aiding China and saving the Chinese government's army, it is not too late. Former Secretary of State Marshall's China policy was not to provide assistance, but to force it to organize a coalition government, which is tantamount to handing China over to the Soviet Union. When Congress approved the foreign aid bill last year, it passed my amendment to provide $125 million in military aid to China, but in reality only a few million dollars' worth of military equipment was shipped to China last year. Of the three freighters unloaded in November last year, only two arrived in China. The State Department is solely responsible for all of this.

The Chinese government will do its best to assist and properly arrange for transportation to Guangzhou and housing in Guangzhou. It is reported that the envoys of several major countries have already agreed to this matter. Except for a small number of personnel who will remain in Nanjing to continue handling consular affairs, most of the personnel will go to Guangzhou. In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had previously sent people to Guangzhou to discuss the relocation of the envoys of various countries with the local authorities. The second batch of personnel will also be led by Liu Tingye, the head of the Protocol Section of the Department of Protocol, to plan everything.

As for the position of Director of the American Affairs Department, it may be temporarily held concurrently by Mr. Dong.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Luo Mengce, Bai Jianshi, Fan Qianzhong, and others of the National Committee of the China Democratic Freedom Socialist Society recently issued a declaration entitled "Our View of Legitimacy, Revolution, and Peace."

Therefore, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should negotiate peace on the basis of "peace and revolution" and establish peace. The declaration also revises the opinions of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and summarizes them into eight basic clauses for negotiating peace and establishing peace: (1) The Kuomintang should abandon the concept of legitimacy, and the Communist Party should also cancel the demand for punishing war criminals. (2) President Chiang has completed the historical mission of leading the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance Against Japan and has the right to retire with honor, and there is no need to bother him with state affairs. (3) In accordance with democratic principles, reorganize the armies of the two parties, and the state should establish a non-partisan military institution to be responsible for commanding them. (4) Confiscate bureaucratic capital. (5) Reform the land system. (6) Abolish or revise various treaties that damage national interests (including the Sino-US Commercial Treaty and the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship). (7) Convene a National Assembly meeting and establish a coalition government. (8) The new government should be a progressive and moderate revolutionary government, taking a middle-of-the-road line to the left by bloodless means, and gradually promoting China's political democracy, economic equality, and the modernization of agricultural and industrial production, and the socialization of distribution.

It must be known that a ceasefire is a prerequisite for peace, but in order to achieve the purpose of a ceasefire, personnel must first be sent to negotiate. (2) Or some may think that supporting peace is the opinion of a few people and cannot represent public opinion. We would like to know how many people oppose peace and how those who oppose peace prove that they represent public opinion. (3) Since Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's New Year's Day message advocated peace first, and Premier Sun also has peace proposals later, they should actively take effective action responsibly. (4) This Yuan is in recess and cannot convene meetings, but most of the legislators in Nanjing have expressed their urging the government to seek peace and have contacted colleagues in various regions to advocate together.

Zhang stated to reporters: "The success of peace talks still requires the continued efforts of all parties. Based on my personal observations in Nanjing, the government genuinely possesses sincerity in restoring peace. What Mr. Chiang is currently considering is definitely not a matter of his personal future, but the future of the entire nation. Currently, international mediation is no longer possible. The only viable path to achieving domestic peace is direct negotiation. The government is currently considering how to conduct direct negotiations. As of my departure from Nanjing, it has not yet been decided whether to send Zhang Zhizhong and Shao Lizi to Yan'an. The government is studying its response to the eight conditions proposed by the Chinese Communist Party, which will be released in the form of a public statement. The majority of government officials believe that all but the first of the eight conditions can be considered or accepted in principle." Zhang emphasized that in this day and age, the concept of "success for the king, defeat for the bandit" should no longer exist, and there is fundamentally no such thing as a war criminal. If there are government officials who are extremely disliked by the Chinese Communist Party, they may as well resign first to facilitate the smooth progress of peace talks. Zhang denied having made three suggestions to President Chiang, but stated that he had indeed advocated to the central government that the status of non-ruling parties be recognized, especially the early resumption of the China Democratic League's activities, and the release of political prisoners, and the realization of freedom of speech, etc., to create an environment conducive to peace talks.

Editorial

### Drop the Conditions, Achieve Peace on the Spot!

The Republic of China belongs to the people, so the current issue of war and peace should first be addressed by the people.

What the people truly want to say today is: "Drop the conditions, achieve peace on the spot!"

Today, which side, the government or the Chinese Communist Party, can respect public opinion and still have the people in mind? It depends on who can first express their willingness to accept this sentence from the people, formally declare no more conditions, and immediately cease fire.

Conversely, whichever side today is unwilling to straightforwardly and readily declare no more conditions and immediate ceasefire, that side lacks the sincerity for peace.

This is an extremely simple judgment, but it is extremely accurate. Why? Let us explain the reasons below.

Peace talks have reached a point today where, on the surface, it seems like they have begun, but in reality, they have clearly encountered a reef – not a hidden reef, but a clear one. This reef is the fact that both sides are discussing conditions before a ceasefire. In fact, without a ceasefire, there can be no peace talks, and there is no hope of peace succeeding. Only a "ceasefire" is truly the only prerequisite for peace talks. President Chiang's five principles in his New Year's Day message and Mr. Mao Zedong's eight conditions in his broadcast speech should all be content for discussion and deliberation in peace talks after a ceasefire, and not peace conditions before a ceasefire. If both sides truly want to talk peace, they should abandon their "own" views and think entirely for the people, without any trace of emotional contention. If both sides argue about conditions first, it is inevitable that there will be emotional elements, and there will be no way to talk peace.

Carefully examining President Chiang's New Year's Day message and Mr. Mao's statement on the current situation, we hope that they have a consistent fundamental view of the current situation; they both say that they want to seek the welfare of the country and remove the suffering of the people, and they both are willing to respect the will of the people and realize democratic peace. Since their views are consistent, there should be no problem with peace talks, and the reason why complications have arisen is still because of the so-called "conditions" that are hindering progress? Therefore, our people's first request is to first sincerely ask their "consciences" to both parties, whether they should first immediately cease fire on the spot to reduce the suffering of the people.

The Chinese people have endured eight years of war against Japan, plus three years of internal strife. Not to mention that in the war zones, there have been tragic scenes of death and injury filling the fields, even in towns and villages that have not yet been swept into the vortex of war, people have suffered from the increasing difficulty of livelihood and displacement. If this continues, on the one hand, the suppression of the rebellion will never end, on the other hand, liberation will still be difficult to achieve, and the peace that the people look forward to before and after will still be unattainable. Then, isn't the so-called respecting public opinion by both sides without any basis?

Among the 450 million people, how many are members of the Kuomintang? How many are members of the Communist Party? Although we do not have precise statistics, we can imagine that it is at most one or two percent of the total population. Even if each party has one percent of the members, and all of them advocate continuing the war, using the advocacy of two percent of the total population to force 98 percent of the people to sacrifice themselves in war, hunger, disease, and poverty, is this what those who cannot bear to see people suffer and who govern with policies that do not harm people should do? The Chinese Communist Party claims to "liberate" the people, so shouldn't this be what those who liberate the people should do?

In Mr. Mao's opinion, he believes that military victory is already in sight and that the revolution must be thorough, so he has the bold statement of "any reactionaries who dare to resist must be resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilated." In fact, what he wants to revolutionize is only to overthrow the "Kuomintang's politics," but the means he has adopted have made the people of the whole country suffer from the ravages of war. President Chiang has already clearly stated that "personal advancement and retreat will never be a concern," so why does Mr. Mao need to raise inconceivable conditions again? Even if Mr. Mao's military force today is enough to dominate everything in China, if the future politics of the Communist Party still cannot satisfy the people's hope and even goes against the will of the people, isn't it still going to follow the same path as the Kuomintang? The National Government has been suppressing the Communists for 25 years, but the strength of the Communist Party has not been weakened by military pressure, but on the contrary has continued to expand. If Mr. Mao can now truly seek a political solution with an open mind and put the affairs of the country to a public decision by the people, then it will not only be a blessing for the country, but also a blessing for the Communist Party. Otherwise, the Kuomintang's politics can be overthrown, and the "reactionaries" can be "completely annihilated," but the 450 million people cannot be "completely annihilated." In the 1950s of the 20th century, it should already be the "century of the people." Military force is no longer an effective tool for domestic revolution, and armed force can never be supported by the people. Judging from Mr. Mao's experience and his usual views, he should know what to choose for the solution of the current situation, whether it is war or peace!

We believe that if both sides truly want to talk peace, they must respect public opinion. Public opinion only wants peace, especially a ceasefire first: without a ceasefire, there can be no peace talks. Therefore, those who are unwilling to cease fire first but raise conditions first are no different from hindering the arrival of peace. Principles or foundations, all conditions should be left for calm, open, and honest discussion after a ceasefire. Everything, everything should respect the people's final decision. Talking peace while fighting is not only not true peace and democratic peace, but simply shows no sincerity for peace.

"Lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot!" For the current situation, both sides should "drop the conditions and achieve peace on the spot!"

As we were writing this, we received a special dispatch from Nanjing stating that the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting resolved yesterday: (1) both sides unconditionally cease fire, (2) send personnel to directly negotiate with the Communist Party, and (3) issue the above two resolutions as a response to the Communist Party. Good! The government has indeed made the determination to "drop the conditions and achieve peace on the spot." Let us wait and see for the Chinese Communist Party's response that respects public opinion!

### To Prevent Communists from Seizing American Aid, the Destination Can Be Changed Mid-Voyage; Hoffman Grants Special Privileges to Lapham

[United Press, Washington, 19th] Cleveland, director of the China aid group of the Economic Cooperation Administration, stated on the 19th that the ECA's China branch has been authorized to change the destination of relief supplies at sea. He told our reporter that the order to change the destination was issued to prevent the Communists from seizing the supplies. He said that ECA Administrator Hoffman had given special powers to Lapham, director of the China branch, to take emergency measures to handle reconstruction aid. He continued, "If the Communists continue to infiltrate," Hoffman had told Lapham two months ago that Lapham could order a change of destination for relief supplies bound for North China, and "the order was issued when the China aid program needed more flexibility."

Cleveland refused to speculate whether the second year of China aid would be more or less than the $275 million for the first year ending April 1. He also declined to comment on whether Communist control of China would mean the end of American aid. "I don't know about that, because that is a policy issue and has not been decided." He emphasized that the relief program is quite fluid in the current crisis in China.

[US News Service, Washington, 18th] According to figures announced today by the State Department and the ECA, nearly $320 million of the $400 million allocated by the 80th Congress for the current year's China aid program has already been spent. Of the $275 million allocated to the ECA for economic aid to China, nearly $200 million has been spent. Another $125 million was designated by the Chinese government for the purchase of military supplies, of which more than $120 million has already been spent.

The ECA has recently approved a new amount of $17,000 for China for technical services. Therefore, the total amount of ECA-approved aid to China to date has reached $199,669,000.

In addition, the State Department revealed that under the other $125 million aid program, $120,263,820.28 had been spent as of last Friday, an increase of $19,187.11 from the total amount announced last week.

Mr. Fu first stated his views on the overall situation, saying that while peace is desired by the whole country, it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve the goal of true peace under the current circumstances, because the Communist Party's aim is purely to conquer, and to talk about peace is just preparing for surrender. Regarding the reorganization of NTU, Mr. Fu said that he will take openness and honesty, fairness, stability, and progress as the guidelines, and will cooperate with external academic research institutions on the basis of mutual assistance. In the shortest possible time, he will enrich the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences to reach the highest national standards. In terms of personnel, Zheng Tonghe has been appointed as Dean of Students, Yu Yousun as Chief Secretary, and Zhang Heying is proposed to be appointed as Dean of Academic Affairs, but Mr. Zhang has not yet agreed. In terms of funding, the provincial government will still cover the expenses, but it is estimated that there will be 400 million New Taiwan Dollars allocated for contingency and equipment. Mr. Fu expressed in a light tone that he is confident that he has the ability to govern NTU and make it a standard university. Finally, he said that Mrs. Hu Shi and his wife will come to Taiwan by sea on the Haiqian ship on the 21st, and Hu Shi himself may be invited to Taiwan for inspection.

(2) Issue 20,000 yuan in travel expenses per person. (3) Order all agencies nationwide to give priority to employing dispersed employees and to provide the same rank and salary as before.

At that time, the political affairs meeting on the peace plan was being held on the third floor of the Executive Yuan. Because of their persistence for several hours, the ministers and political committee members were unable to leave freely.

### New US Plan for the Indonesian Issue - Not Supported by All Countries - Security Council Decides to Postpone Discussion Until Today

### British Merchant Ships Prepare to Sail to Tianjin - Our Shipping Industry Expresses Opposition - Five Senior Crew Organizations Schedule Meeting Today to Discuss Countermeasures

[Our Newspaper Report] Since the outbreak of the war in North China, coastal routes have been shortened, and private shipping companies in our country have had to gradually shift their business focus to the south. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the Hong Kong British Merchant Shipping Company is preparing to send a large number of ships to Tianjin to trade with North China. After hearing the news, our shipping industry elected representatives to visit Executive Yuan President Sun in Beijing a few days ago, requesting the government to allow domestic shipping companies to undertake the task of maintaining close commercial relations along the coast in order to protect our country's shipping rights. Mr. Sun promised to consider it. A reporter recently interviewed the United Federation of Senior Crew Organizations of Chinese Merchant Ships on this matter to inquire about their opinions. According to Mr. Jiang Keni, the Executive Director of the Federation: If the British shipping company's sending ships to Tianjin becomes a reality, it is tantamount to re-infringing upon our country's shipping rights. Our shipping industry should immediately take action and request the government to allow domestic ships to sail to important ports in North China, so as to ensure that valuable shipping rights are not stolen by any ambitious person taking advantage of the opportunity. At the same time, if representatives can be sent to North China to contact the Communist army, it will be even more appropriate. This action will greatly benefit the survival of 1.2 million tons of domestic ships and promote the realization of peace. If the government and the Communist army value national interests, they will surely approve this move. As for whether peace can be realized as soon as possible, our country's shipping industry will feel infinitely gratified. It is learned that the five senior crew organizations have scheduled a meeting today to further discuss this matter.

### Rice Ration Price Increase Sparks Opposition from Labor Community; General Labor Union Chairman Zhou to Petition Authorities Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the price of rationed rice was increased, the labor community in this city has risen in opposition. Various industry labor unions have submitted petitions to the Municipal General Labor Union, requesting them to negotiate with the authorities. The reasons stated are as follows: Rice shops in various districts were informed of the price increase in advance and claimed that the rice rations were already sold out or that the special rice rations had not yet been received. Regardless of whether the reason is that the rice shops are intentionally creating difficulties in an attempt to commit fraud or that the Civil Affairs Committee has not actually issued the special rice rations, the fact remains that most of the rice rations for workers and their families in this city have not been purchased. However, the rice price in this month's cost of living index is calculated based on the rationed price of 42 yuan per dou, which is a significant loss for the workers. Furthermore, the distribution of special rice rations this month is extremely delayed. Some labor unions had already adjusted the sales price the day after receiving the ration coupons, making it impossible to purchase rice even if they rushed to do so. Therefore, they request that the price of special rice rations for this month be maintained at the original price of 42 yuan per dou until the 30th of this month. The Municipal General Labor Union held a special meeting of the standing committee yesterday to discuss the matter and decided that Chairman Zhou Xuexiang would go to the Municipal Government and the Bureau of Social Affairs today to petition.

### Completion of Ditch Management Pumping Station; Water Supply to Western Shanghai to Increase

In order to continue to alleviate the water shortage in western Shanghai, the Public Utilities Bureau implemented a plan in April of 1948 to connect to inland water plants and transfer surplus water to western Shanghai. The main projects, such as the pressure boosting station on Xietu Road and the laying of an 18-inch dedicated pipeline on Wanping Road to connect the existing water pipes on Xietu Road and Hengshan Road, have been completed. However, due to the excessive power required for the motors in the Xietu Road pumping station, the China Merchants Electric Power Company was unable to supply this large amount of electricity at once. The Public Utilities Bureau invited representatives from China Merchants, French Concession, and Shanghai Electric Power Companies to discuss the matter. It was decided that Shanghai Electric Power Company would increase the power supply to the French Concession, and then a dedicated line would be set up by China Merchants to connect directly to the pumping station. This power connection project is expected to be completed within days. Once the water supply is connected, the western Shanghai area will be supplied with a mixture of water from British merchants inland and the Public Utilities Bureau's deep well station. The increased water supply is expected to increase the population served in western Shanghai from 30% to 50%.

### War Criminal Ito Tadao Indicted by Military Tribunal; Loyal National Salvation Army Transport Team En Route Encounters Accident, Drifts to Taiwan and is Captured and Massacred

Captain Ito Tadao, a war criminal recently extradited from Japan to China, has been indicted by the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense after the completion of the investigation. The indictment lists the criminal facts, evidence, and legal provisions as follows: (1) Criminal Facts: Ito Tadao graduated from the Faculty of Law of Japan's Chuo University and served as a legal officer in the Japanese Army. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, various locations along the Beijing-Shanghai line fell one after another. Many Chinese patriots engaged in guerrilla warfare in the hope of restoring the country. In the winter of 1944, Li Shirong, the transportation director of the First Detachment of the Loyal National Salvation Army stationed in Pudong under the former Military Commission, was ordered to lead team members Jiang Xulun, Yao Hanmin, Yao Xingzhou, Chuan Haigen, and others, totaling twenty-four people, to hire a sailboat to go to Ningbo Lihu for training. En route, they encountered a storm and drifted to Daan Port in Taiwan. They were discovered by the enemy, and all team members were captured and sent to the former Japanese Taiwan Army Headquarters. Ito Tadao, a legal officer of the said department, together with Colonel Minoru Fukuda and Lieutenant Takeshi Ota, etc., did not treat the arrested Jiang Xulun, Wu Xuezhu, Zhao Hesheng, Chuan Haigen, Tang Jinsan, Lu Desheng, Chen Zhiwei, Xi Yixiang, Shen Amao, Shen Bochu, Cao Shuiquan, Gao Zhenchu, Shen Xianglin, Chuan Quanyun, Shen Shuigen, Zhao Linshan, Xue Maogen, Cai Lansheng, Chen Sanlin, Shen Zhicai, and other twenty people as prisoners of war. Instead, they arbitrarily used the name of military trials to falsely accuse them of anti-Japanese crimes and sentenced them to death. They were executed by firing squad on August 2, 1945, in the open space southwest of the Taiwan Army Accounting Department in Suidocho, Taipei. Li Shirong and Zhuang Genqing were imprisoned and only released after Japan's surrender. Subsequently, on June 17, 1946, Li Shirong reported the case to the Taiwan Garrison Headquarters, and the defendant Ito Tadao was arrested. During the investigation period, he was already sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of 20 years by the US Military Tribunal in Shanghai for another case and was being executed in Japan. After negotiations by our delegation stationed in Japan, he was extradited to China and sent to this court for investigation. (2) Evidence and Legal Provisions: During 1945, the defendant served as a lieutenant legal officer in the former Japanese Taiwan Legal Department and as a judge in the Japanese Taiwan Army Provisional Military Tribunal. He has admitted to this. Although he firmly denies the above-mentioned criminal facts, the circumstances of how Jiang Xulun and others were arrested, how they were transferred to the Japanese military tribunal for trial, and how they were sentenced to death have been recounted in detail by Li Shirong, a survivor of the same case, during the trial of war criminal Wang Ruiqi by the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Taiwan Garrison Headquarters. Moreover, the court has also reviewed the case file, which contains interrogation records and judgments signed and stamped by the defendant during the Japanese military tribunal trial, providing solid evidence. The defendant's defense that "he was unaware of this case before and after the fact, and that the seal on the judgment was stolen by his superior" is nothing but empty sophistry and cannot be accepted. The Loyal National Salvation Army is a legitimate anti-Japanese force organized by our former Military Commission, and its members have military status. After being captured, they should have been treated as prisoners of war. However, the defendants summarily executed them, which is illegal. Even if the victims Jiang Xulun and others had previously served as intelligence agents, their victimization occurred when they were en route to Yuhu for training and their ship was caught in a storm and drifted to Taiwan. This is different from being caught while infiltrating enemy forces to carry out espionage missions. According to Articles 29 and 31 of the Hague Convention on Land Warfare, they cannot be treated as spies. The defendant, as a legal officer, was responsible for upholding the law. However, he disregarded the law and slaughtered Jiang Xulun and others, which clearly violates Article 4, paragraph 2, and Article 46, paragraph 1 of the Hague Convention on Land Warfare, and Articles 2 and 3 of the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. He is also suspected of committing serious crimes under Article 2, paragraph 2, and Article 3, paragraph 1 of the Regulations for the Trial of War Criminals. Therefore, he is prosecuted in accordance with Article 1, paragraph 1, and Article 26 of the same regulations, and Article 230, paragraph 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

### New Ruian Steamer Towed into Port; Dengheng Steamer to Undergo Cargo Inspection Starting Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Xin Ruian and Dengheng steamers collided at the Wusongkou around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, causing damage to both ships. Fortunately, the crew and passengers were unharmed, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The Xin Ruian steamer had a hole punctured in the stern of its right side, allowing river water to enter. The captain of the ship feared an accident and urgently ran the ship aground on a shoal. Passengers and others disembarked safely. The company chartered two iron barges from the China Transport Company to start unloading cargo, and some cargo was shipped out yesterday. In addition to purchasing cement and yellow sand in Wusong, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company transported 30 bags of cement and 3 tons of yellow sand to patch the hole. In the afternoon, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company dispatched tugboat No. 314 to tow the steamer to the Qiujiang Wharf in Zhanghuabang, Wusong, to be moored. It will be towed to Shanghai this morning and then enter the dock for repairs. The Dengheng steamer also had a small hole below the waterline at the bow, which was located in the bow water tank, causing leakage. Therefore, it entered port around 10:00 AM yesterday and docked at the Yangjiadu No. 5 Wharf at noon. It is scheduled to remove the cargo from the forward hold today to raise the bow and conduct a detailed inspection. If there is no major problem, it will be slightly repaired and can then exit the port and sail south. Regarding the issue of liability for the collision, both captains have submitted reports, which have been forwarded by the two companies to the Maritime Administration Bureau for judgment.

### Military Vehicle Disregards Inspection; Military Police Severely Injured

[Report from Our Newspaper] At 12:10 AM the night before last, a team of military police from the Ninth Regiment of Military Police was performing patrol duty in front of the Xinxin Grand Theater on Huashan Road and Nanjing West Road when a yellow military jeep sped past.

Now, my only hope is entirely placed on the 'Reader's Aid-to-Education Program.' Please grant my hope..." The funds raised for this year's aid-to-education program will be used to purchase and store high-quality rice at market prices to maintain the value of the currency. Distributions will also be calculated based on the value of the rice. We are currently in contact with a rice shop to arrange the rice storage method, and details will be announced later. As for the application procedures for aid, all rules and regulations are the same as last year. We also acknowledge with gratitude the donations of 2,000 yuan from Ding Qinsheng, 1,000 yuan from Li Xiaowen, 200 yuan from Cao Guiyan, 50 yuan from He Nianqu, and 60 yuan from Zheng Hengjia.

### Two Blind People Sentenced to Two Months Imprisonment Each for Adultery

[Report from Our Newspaper] Su Ying, a blind woman who works as an astrologer, was accused by her husband of adultery with Liu Changqing, her fellow apprentice. Judge Wang Yuan of the District Court concluded the trial yesterday afternoon and sentenced both defendants to two months imprisonment with a two-year suspended sentence. The plaintiff's incidental civil lawsuit was dismissed. Su Ying married Liang Xueshi, her husband, at the age of fifteen. The couple often argued and were incompatible. On December 21st of last year, she left home and lived in Changqing's house. Because of Changqing's concubine's secret report, Xueshi caught the two blind people together at Liu's house on Christmas night. After reporting to the police, both blind people admitted that they had had a relationship. The case was transferred to the District Attorney's Office for prosecution. Xueshi and Changqing's wife were summoned to testify yesterday. Su Ying said that she could not bear the abuse and vowed never to return to the Liang family. Liu's wife did not intend to file a lawsuit against her husband and Su Ying. The court did not summon Liu's concubine. The two blind people were led to court by a young girl yesterday. After the adjournment, they were still talking non-stop.

### Money Supply Gradually Stabilizing

Yesterday, the trend of the money supply in this city gradually stabilized. A large amount of remittances from South China arrived the day before yesterday, coupled with abundant disbursements from the national treasury. The tightness of recent days has been slightly alleviated. The supply of funds in the market is abundant, but because goods are viewed favorably, there are people competing to buy, and the demand is very strong. Interbank lending rates are between 60 and 80 yuan, but occasionally still rise to 90 yuan. Around noon, it was rumored that currency funds still had a contracting trend, and the gloom continued.

### Foreign Exchange Certificates Continue to Decline

Yesterday, the Central Bank's exchange rate for overseas remittances remained unchanged at 200 yuan per US dollar in gold yuan. Foreign exchange transfer certificates opened steadily in the morning, with banks buying at 169 yuan and selling at 170.5 yuan. Because the street's ability to clear goods was sluggish, coupled with the Guangzhou authorities in South China announcing restrictions on the transfer of transfer certificates, the market presented a situation of transactions existing only in name. The sentiment for selling air was strong. The market closed with buying at 169 yuan and selling at 170 yuan, with little transaction volume, down one yuan from the previous session.

### Assisting in Tightening the Money Supply

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Since last week, the China Trust Bureau has been ordered to auction off goods on a large scale in order to contract currency and tighten the money supply. Yesterday, the bureau made the 281st decision to auction woolen fabrics. Today, it will continue to auction cotton cloth and general merchandise. There are a total of 80 boxes of woolen fabrics and 8,400 bolts of cotton cloth. There are also more than 100 kinds of general merchandise, such as leather goods, foreign wines, auto parts, hemp bags, white pine boards, sewing machines, cement, radios, etc., in large quantities. If they can all be sold, 100 million gold yuan can be recovered.

### If the Shortfall in Returned Checks is Not Paid, Exchange Will Be Suspended Immediately

Regulations previously stipulated the time for check clearing: if banks and firms did not replenish the exchange shortfall and returned check shortfall, they should complete the procedures no later than 8:30 AM on the morning of the decision, otherwise the exchange would be suspended. However, after this method was implemented, many of the bank and company checks still failed to comply with the time. In order to facilitate business, the check clearing house has now specifically decided that if the shortfall in returned checks is still not replenished by 9:00 AM on the morning of the decision, the exchange will publicly announce the suspension of exchange at the exchange hall during the day's business. The above measures have been notified to the three public associations of banks, money houses, and trust companies by the clearing house and have been implemented since yesterday.

### Export Exchange Settlement Volume Last Week Slightly Increased Compared to the Previous Week

There were a total of 20 kinds of exchange settlement goods, of which the exchange settlement amount for textiles was the largest, totaling US$1,058,546.97. The decision was made for cotton yarn, totaling US$520,988.80.

### Rice Prices Decline

The rice market is showing a decline because the price in Wuxi is reported to be small, and people's hearts are weak. Moreover, other commodity prices have fallen in recent days, while rice prices remain at a high peak, causing concern about being at a high position. Goods owners all want to sell. The south market opened down 50-60 yuan, and then due to more selling and sluggish sales, it fell another 40-50 yuan, for a total drop of 100 yuan. White japonica rice was 1,500 yuan, thin indica rice was 1,550 yuan, and Yin Yuan rice fell 150 yuan. There was a road to sell the whole number of rough japonica rice, and the price was very comfortable. Wuzhen rough japonica rice was 1,330 yuan, only down 30-40 yuan. In the north market, white japonica rice fell 100 yuan, and early thin indica rice fell sharply by 140-150 yuan. The sales of glutinous rice have already passed, and it fell sharply by more than 200 yuan. Yesterday, a total of 8,049 piculs arrived at the two markets.

Flour

The market opened weak, but the later market was relatively strong. The initial opening saw some goods owners still selling to seek cash. Old cars opened at 560 yuan, but later, due to the loosening of the money supply and the rise of various commodities outside the industry, people's hearts also became firm. Old cars finally closed at 584 yuan, an increase of 4 yuan. Military ships closed at 560 yuan, slightly smaller. Jiancheng first fell and then flattened. The first batch of miscellaneous brand flour fell by 10 yuan, and the second batch opened the same as yesterday. Large bags of wheat bran fell by 8-9 yuan.

Grains

The downward trend continued, except for soybeans, which first fell and then rebounded. Hankou Zha beans initially fell sharply by 50 yuan, but later, upon hearing that the market price of oil cakes rose sharply, people's hearts were firm and rose by 50 yuan, closing at 800 yuan. Car beans also rose and followed suit. The transaction in the later market was exceptionally active. Corn Qing Bang watched and waited, and actual sales were sluggish, falling by another 100 yuan or more. Red sorghum and sesame customers were silent, and the market supply exceeded demand, falling sharply by one or more. Raw peanuts and green beans were stable, and yuan wheat was not

done open.

Edible Oil

Yesterday, the upward movement was seen again. Because the money supply turned loose and commodity prices outside the industry rose first, people's hearts were unanimously firm. Retail investors took advantage of the low prices to take delivery, and goods owners tried to raise prices. Soybean oil rose rapidly from an opening price of 4,800 yuan to close at 5,500 yuan. Rapeseed oil closed at 4,500 yuan, each up 900 yuan, reaching a light of 20%. Jittoku raw oil rose from 4,950 yuan to close at 5,500 yuan, rising by as much as 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake customers take delivery, Changzi cake did 440 yuan, up 60 yuan.

### Grain and Oil Markets Scheduled for Eight-Day Holiday

Trading Until the 22nd of This Month

The market will reopen on February 2nd (the fifth day of the Lunar New Year).

### This City's Export Business Has Recently Trended Further Downward

According to those in charge of the export industry, this city's export business has recently trended further downward. Export materials such as pig bristles, tung oil, fur, casings, and tea, which usually have the most exports, have had very few exports recently. Exports of pig bristles and casings are only around US$10,000. Tung oil had only a small number of US dollars in exports last week, which is a huge difference compared to past export volumes.

The reasons for this decrease in export volume, in addition to the blockage of water transport on various Yangtze River lines, frequent military transport and military grain transport, and cargo ships not daring to go, preventing export materials from being transported, the phenomenon of the center of export shifting south is becoming more and more obvious, which is also one of the important reasons. If the situation remains as it is now, the export business this week will not be able to increase and may even decrease further.

### Silk Stops Falling and Rises

Rayon: Yesterday, Qiaochu opened at 75,000 yuan, once rose to 78,000 yuan, and slightly fell back to 76,000 yuan at noon. Today's price is 80,000 yuan. Sinia's current bill transaction was 78,000 yuan, up 7-8,000 yuan from the previous session. The interbank overnight interest rate has returned to 5-6 percent due to the loosening of the money supply.

Raw Silk: Youshiren was separately responsible for opening at 83,000 yuan, rising to a maximum of 85,000 yuan, and slightly falling back to 82,000 yuan at noon. The Jie Li Qian Jing rose to 64,000 yuan. Foreign firms are still watching, and export sales have become sluggish.

Silk: Huaqiang quilt cover opened at 44,000 yuan, once rose to 44,700 yuan, then fell back to 43,700 yuan, and rose back to 44,000 yuan at noon, up about 2,600 yuan from the previous session. The interbank overnight interest rate is 5-6 percent.

### Tea Market Transactions are Weak

Upon investigation, after the existing stock of various red and green teas of good quality trended towards depletion, the process has been quiet for a long time. As for ordinary goods, although there is supply, sellers also consider them to be rare goods and are unwilling to part with them, so buyers have still been unable to smoothly purchase them. Transactions are narrow, and the trend is strongly stable, with market prices repeatedly firming.

It is known that most goods owners currently intend to wait for the red plate to open for sale next spring. Looking at this situation, it will be difficult for the market to become lively before the end of the lunar year.

### Local Customers Take Delivery at Low Prices, Cotton Yarn Market Firm and Cheerful, Cloth Buying Slightly Moves and Shows Recovery

Yesterday, the yarn market was firm and cheerful, because the money supply was loosening, and people's hearts were mostly fluctuating. There were many local customers taking delivery at low prices, and replica factories also added purchases. As a result, each yarn increased by more than 15%. 42-count Blue Phoenix stepped from 69,000 yuan to close at 77,000 yuan, up 9,000 yuan from the previous session. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose 7,000 yuan, 32-count Silver Moon was 10,500 yuan higher, ending at 635,000 yuan.

21-count Double Horse initially opened at a low of 52,000 yuan, and once fell to 51,000 yuan in the middle. Near noon, buying was booming, and the price was called up to 60,000 yuan to close, finally rising 10,000 yuan. Factory orders were 10,500 yuan higher, and one-day arbitrage did 4,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse had a good start of 6,000 yuan. The other Golden Rooster and Jincheng also rose by about 6,000 yuan. 16-count Guangming finally stood at the 40,000 yuan mark, and other yarns also saw progress.

The cotton cloth market was stable and prosperous, and prices rose slightly. Because the money supply in the market was looser, the industry added replenishment one after another. Initially, it opened at a firm level, but in the middle, customer sales were still sluggish, and more sellers were still selling, and the market tended to be weak again. Upon hearing of the high rise in cotton yarn near the close, people's hearts revived. As a result, each cloth still closed at the opening price.

Longtou fine cloth was called outside the market at about 2,100 yuan. Wufu fine cloth stood at the 2,000 yuan mark, an increase of 160 yuan. Trumpet boy's fine cloth increased by 150 yuan, ending at 1,770 yuan. B Longtou fine cloth also had a good start of 150 yuan.
