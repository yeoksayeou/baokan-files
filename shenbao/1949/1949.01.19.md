### Progress Achieved in Peiping Peace Talks; Representatives of the Promotion Association Leave the City After Last Year; City Council Protests Bombardment of the City to the Communist Side

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 18th Afternoon, 3:15 PM Telegraph] Qualified sources told reporters on the evening of the 17th that significant progress had reportedly been made in the efforts for peace in Peiping. The source also hinted that, as a result of this development, the arrival of peace in Peiping would be earlier than previously estimated. Another major newspaper in the city revealed today that the only issues being negotiated between the two sides are the procedural aspects of peace, namely whether it should be "Ceasefire, Peace, Lay Down Arms" or "Lay Down Arms, Peace, Ceasefire."

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 18th Afternoon, 3:15 PM Telegraph] Representatives of the North China People's Peace Promotion Association held another meeting on the morning of the 18th. After completing all preparations, they departed from Xizhimen around 1:00 PM, heading towards Xiangshan, which is currently under the control of the Communist army. The delegation is led by Lu Fu, a legislator and acting president of China University, and Ms. Kang Tongbi (daughter of Kang Youwei), totaling eleven people. It is reported that two people were added temporarily upon departure. The car displayed a white cloth flag with the words "North China People's Peace Promotion Association." It is believed that the delegation may stay overnight in Xiangshan tonight. The Peiping press corps originally planned to accompany the delegation for interviews, but was unable to do so due to the delegation's advance departure in the afternoon.

[United Press, Peiping, 18th Dispatch] A truck, filled with local civilian leaders, drove out of Xizhimen on the 18th to meet with Communist General Ye Jianying in the Communist-controlled area, appealing for a ceasefire. Although He Siyuan was injured on the morning of the 17th, he insisted on joining the delegation, which is traveling to the Communist area with the support of General Fu Zuoyi. It is understood that the delegation only has the power to request a ceasefire, so that leaders of the Nationalists and Communists in this area can discuss the conditions for peace in Peiping during the ceasefire. Neutral observers here are skeptical that any steps in the negotiations between the dominant Communist army and the besieged Nationalist army will be accepted by the Communist army.

[United Press, Peiping, 17th Dispatch] (Delayed) According to unconfirmed reports, the Nanjing government has assured General Fu Zuoyi that he has full authority to decide whether to turn Peiping into a battlefield or surrender. As a result, hopes for a local peaceful resolution in Peiping have resurfaced. Meanwhile, the North China Peace Promotion Association appealed to Mao Zedong on the 18th, asking: "Are you willing to build a new Peiping with bloodshed, a large number of orphans and widows, or to build a new Peiping with prosperity, democracy, and freedom?" This appeal may ease the conditions demanded by the Communist army for Peiping.

[Associated Press, Peiping, 18th Dispatch] The Peiping City Council protested to the Communist army today about the more than one hundred shells that have fallen in the city, causing injuries and damage, demanding that the shelling stop. The siege of Peiping has now entered its sixth week. A novel development during this siege is the mobile military tribunal. Judges, guards, and executioners travel in trucks, conducting trials on the spot for those who violate martial law. Some executioners carry broadswords, but so far only five people have been executed by firing squad, and no beheadings have taken place.

[Associated Press, Peiping, 17th Dispatch] This morning, a shell landed 150 feet from the residence of the Vatican representative, Martina, and exploded immediately. According to Martina, the residence was shaken, but no one was injured.

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 18th Dispatch] The fighting in the suburbs of Peiping has been quiet for the past two days, with no contact.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] Reports received here today from Tianjin stated that the consulates of France, Italy, Belgium, Greece, and Switzerland have reported to their respective embassies in Nanjing that none of their nationals were injured when the Communist army shelled Tianjin, and the situation is currently very calm.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] Amid the government's active evacuation, Foreign Minister Wu has been in contact with foreign envoys to China, informing them of the government's future plans and hoping that they can stand together with the government if necessary. It is reported that most of the envoys have indicated that unless their respective governments issue special instructions, they will evacuate to safer areas with the government.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The evacuation and downsizing of various ministries have gradually caused some unease and disturbances. Hundreds of dismissed officials and workers of the Ministry of Finance made demands to the ministry authorities on the afternoon of the 18th, hoping that: (1) In addition to the three months' salary and 3,000 yuan for travel expenses stipulated by the government, evacuation expenses could be increased. (2) Evacuation expenses should be issued immediately. To ensure the force of their demands, all officials and workers of the ministry were not allowed to leave. The front, back, and side doors of the ministry were locked, cutting off pedestrian traffic. Around 5:00 PM, they gathered in the minister's office building, demanding an immediate response. Because Minister Xu Kan was away on official business in Shanghai and had not yet returned, Vice Minister Yang Daoji responded, explaining that the government had done its best in making these arrangements. However, the crowd was agitated and remained adamant. Until 7:15 PM, Vice Minister Yang sincerely explained that increasing evacuation expenses was beyond the Ministry of Finance's power to decide, but that evacuation expenses could definitely be issued starting at noon on the 19th. The crowd then dispersed.

### More Than Two Hundred National Assembly Delegates Remaining in Peiping Telegraph Sun Ke and Mao Zedong Separately, Requesting an Immediate Ceasefire and Sending Representatives to Negotiate Peace

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] More than two hundred National Assembly delegates remaining in Nanjing held a meeting at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 18th, chaired by Ding Xuanxiao. Many opinions were expressed on the issue of peace and war. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that each person would freely sign and separately telegraph Premier Sun Ke and Mao Zedong in Yan'an, requesting them to consider the lives of the people, immediately cease fire, and send representatives to negotiate and jointly promote the realization of peace. The two telegrams are recorded as follows:

(1) Respectfully to Premier Sun Ke, Since the President issued a message on New Year's Day, proposing five principles for peace, the whole country rejoiced. We, the undersigned, have expressed our sincere support. Now the Communist Party has also put forward eight conditions for peace on the 14th, although the distance from the President's proposals is still far, it has clearly revealed the dawn of peace. In addition to requesting that they base their position on national independence and national freedom, and in view of the historical lessons that those who rely on virtue prosper and those who rely on strength perish, please reconsider the conditions for peace and immediately appoint appropriate personnel to negotiate with the Communist Party, seek effective ways to peace in every way, and both sides first cease military action, so that we can turn swords into ploughshares and put the people to rest. We urgently await your response.

(2) Respectfully to Mr. Mao Zedong in Yan'an, For several years, the people of the whole country have suffered from the scourge of war, with the strong scattered in all directions, and the old and weak abandoned in ditches. The suffering is indescribable. The nation's vitality has been lost, and the nation's survival is in danger. President Chiang, in view of this, issued a message on New Year's Day, proposing five principles for peace. The people of the whole country believe that the door to peace has been opened and are overjoyed. Recently, reading the newspapers, we saw that you also put forward eight conditions for peace on the 14th, and said, "The people of the whole country have already shown their will, and the people are eager to achieve peace as soon as possible." This shows that you have a desire for peace, which is deeply gratifying. However, the conditions for peace are still far apart. We urge you to consider the position of national independence and national freedom again. Considering the history of the past, those who rely on virtue prosper, and those who rely on strength perish. We especially hope that you will attach importance to the lives of the people and immediately cease military action. Both sides will send representatives to negotiate concrete ways to achieve peace, so that we can turn swords into ploughshares and put the people to rest. We are entrusted with the heavy responsibility of the people and cannot but speak, and cannot bear not to speak. We sincerely hope that peace will be realized immediately, so as to preserve the nation's vitality, strive for international status, and work hard to build a new China. It would be fortunate.

### Democratic and People's Parties Call for a Ceasefire between the Nationalists and Communists

[This City Dispatch] The Chinese Democratic Party recently issued its views on the current situation, first analyzing Mao Zedong's eight statements, believing that the distance between the two sides is not very far and that there is much room for compromise. Therefore, it is quite optimistic about the future of peace. Secondly, it also put forward opinions on peace, calling on the Nationalists and Communists to immediately cease fire and start peace talks.

[Another Dispatch] The Chinese Democratic Party called for peace and issued its third telegram, addressed to Mao Zedong, stating briefly that since you are a new democrat, how can you bear to put China in a situation of eternal doom? We hope that you will have the determination of great benevolence and great courage to first cease fire and elect non-partisan figures to make preliminary negotiations. We also hope that the government will broaden its vision and invite all political parties in opposition to participate in the peace movement, and no longer close its doors to seek the effect of collective wisdom.

### Soviet Response Refuses Mediation; Suggests Direct Negotiations Between the Nationalists and Communists; United States and Britain Do Not Announce Contents of Response

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 17th Dispatch] Moscow Radio broadcast a communique from the Soviet government on the night of the 17th, stating that the Soviet government had refused the Chinese government's call for mediation in the Chinese civil war. The communique specifically pointed out that the Soviet response was delivered to Chuan Bingchang, the Chinese ambassador to the Soviet Union. The response stated that in order to abide by its principle of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, the Soviet Union believes that it is unwise to accept China's proposal to participate in mediation. Not only that, but making China a democratic and peaceful country should be entirely a matter for the Chinese people.

[United Press, London, 17th Dispatch] Tass News Agency, broadcast by Moscow Radio and monitored here, stated that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky had delivered a note verbale stating the Soviet Union's position to Chuan Bingchang, the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, on the 17th. According to the broadcast, the Soviet response pointed out that the Soviet Union "believes it is not appropriate to undertake mediation." The Soviet Union also suggested that the Chinese government negotiate directly with the Chinese Communists without foreign interference.

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 17th Dispatch] State Department Press Liaison Officer McDermott declined to comment when reporters asked about the Nationalist government's request for mediation in the civil war by the United States, Britain, and France. He merely repeated relevant remarks made by Acting Secretary of State Lovett last week. Lovett told reporters last week that he had received a notification from the Chinese government, but declined to comment further. McDermott stated that Britain and France had also received the Chinese government's note verbale. When asked whether the note verbale had been answered, he replied that it had been answered, and cited news reports from the 15th of January to prove that Nanjing had received the response. The contents of the response were not disclosed.

[Associated Press, Washington, 18th Dispatch] Officials here today declined to comment on the Soviet Union's rejection of the Chinese government's invitation to mediate the civil war. It is reported that the United States, Britain, and France have all politely declined this suggestion from the Chinese government.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th Dispatch] According to well-informed sources, British Foreign Secretary Bevin will instruct the British Ambassador to Nanjing within days to inform the Chinese government that, in the current situation, it is difficult for Britain to mediate the Chinese civil war. However, the British Foreign Office remains tight-lipped about the Chinese government's application for mediation and the British government's response.

### Nanjing University Professors Call for Direct Negotiations between the Two Sides

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] Nanjing University Professors Wu Qiqu, Yu Jingyi, Liu Butong, Sun Mingjing, Ni Shangyuan, Ge Fuding, Zhao Mian, Ni Qingyuan, Chen Wenjuan, Yin Xizhong, and others issued the following statement on the 18th regarding their attitude toward peace: "We are dedicated to education and are pursuers of truth, justice, and humanity. For several years, we have consistently believed that domestic problems should not be resolved by military means, because this will not only lead to excessive sacrifices by the people, but also plunge the nation into danger and destruction. Today, we still uphold this view. The government's New Year's Day message and the Communist Party's positive response have clearly opened the door to peace. Now both sides must show sincerity, make appropriate concessions, immediately cease fire, and send representatives to begin direct negotiations to quickly end this cruel war. We also hope that intellectuals across the country will stand on the side of the people and urge both sides to realize peace. In short, the people of China today must survive, and the civil war must end immediately. We only know that the stability of the country and the welfare of the people are the urgent tasks at hand. We are not biased towards any side. We will wholeheartedly support and cooperate with anyone who can make the interests of the people the highest principle and guarantee the people's freedom, political democracy, and economic equality, so as to jointly seek their early realization."

### Cherish the People's Lives and Preserve the National Essence; The Chinese Peace Promotion Association Contributes a "Peace Negotiation Outline"

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The Chinese Peace Promotion Association recently sent a telegram to President Chiang and Chairman Mao, asking them to adopt it. The original text is as follows: "The eight-year war of resistance has damaged the national vitality, and the three-year civil war has brought the national essence to the brink of collapse. Stopping the fighting and resuming peace is the unanimous demand of the whole country. Fortunately, the door to peace has been opened, and the conflict within the walls can be eliminated. We are overjoyed. However, considering that the conditions proposed by both sides are far apart, we are deeply afraid that the peace talks will fail and everything will be destroyed. Therefore, from the perspective of the interests of the people and with an absolutely fair attitude, we have shortened the distance between the two sides and contributed a 'Peace Negotiation Outline' for adoption. We respectfully ask you to cherish the lives of the people, preserve the national essence, be open and honest, and shake hands and make peace. If you adopt the methods proposed by our association as the basis for negotiations, we believe that the cruel war can be ended immediately, and the strength and prosperity of the country and nation can be expected soon. Even if we are mere whip-holders, we will not refuse to do so. Whether it is to bring rain or mud, good fortune or disaster, depends on the change of heart between the two sides. We enclose the outline and respectfully ask you to adopt it. We would be fortunate." The telegram is also attached with a peace negotiation outline, the content of which is the same as that proposed by the University Professors and the State Policy Research Association (see the first page of this newspaper on the 14th). However, in addition to Shanghai or Qingdao for the New Political Consultative Conference, the following item D has been added, stipulating the outline of joint governance as follows: (1) The Republic of China has complete territory and sovereignty, and its sovereignty belongs to all citizens.

### Chongqing City Council Invites All Sectors to Hold Peace Symposium; Decides to Form Chongqing People's Peace Movement Association

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 18th Dispatch] The City Council invited various legal entities, professional groups, and educators to hold a peace symposium. Before the meeting, Mayor Yang Sen exchanged views with Speaker Fan Zhongqu.

### Political Figures in Beijing Widely Study Peace; Zhang Junmai Returned to Shanghai from Beijing Last Night; Legislators Propose Convening a Provisional Session

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Judging from the atmosphere on the 18th, it will be difficult for the government to formulate a response to the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) eight peace negotiation conditions within one or two days. However, political figures are clearly engaged in extensive discussions on the issue of peace. Members of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party arrived in Beijing to present their suggestions to the President. After presenting their suggestions to the President, on the 18th they continued to make contact with various parties all day long. Vice President Li hosted a banquet for Zhang Junmai, Jiang Yuntian, Zhang Zhizhong, and Shao Lizi on the afternoon of the 18th to exchange opinions. On the evening of the 18th, Zhang Qun hosted another dinner for Zhang, Jiang, and others, and further discussions were held. Zhang and Jiang took the night train to Shanghai on the 18th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Legislative Yuan members plan to convene a provisional session to discuss major national policies. This plan was proposed by Legislator Niu Jianchu, and the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan has sent letters to all members to solicit their consent. Niu's original letter stated: "The current situation is evolving in a way that is crucial to the survival of our nation and people. The timing is critical. Our Legislative Yuan, entrusted with the great responsibility by the people of the whole country as the highest representative body of public opinion, should make decisions and express its views at this moment in order to reverse the national fortune and avoid disaster. Article 69 of the Constitution stipulates that the Legislative Yuan may convene a provisional session at the request of more than one-fourth of the legislators. Therefore, according to the constitutional provision, please ask the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan to solicit the consent of more than one-fourth of the legislators to convene a provisional session of the Legislative Yuan in the near future to promptly discuss major policies and save the national crisis."

[Zhang Guoxing, Associated Press Correspondent in Beijing, 18th] A usually reliable source stated on the 18th that while the Sun cabinet has tentatively decided not to directly reject the CCP's counter-proposals, the Communist Party has announced that it is preparing to extend the "offensive of the People's Liberation Army" south of the Yangtze River to support Mao Zedong's message. It is said that the government is focusing on discussing the conditions and methods for reopening peace talks. As for technical issues such as the form and location of the peace conference, they have yet to be resolved.

Official observations on Mao Zedong's eight conditions are that the first condition, "severely punish war criminals," is absolutely unacceptable, while the remaining seven conditions are negotiable. The government's position on the seven conditions can be accurately summarized as follows: (1) Abolish the Constitution – modification can be considered. (2) Abolish the legitimacy of the government – concessions can be made, but basic legitimacy such as the republican system should be preserved. (3) Reorganize the army – according to the comprehensive plan for nationalizing the army, the Communist army should also be reorganized. (4) Confiscate bureaucratic capital and land reform – coincides with the government's policy, but technical details remain to be discussed. (5) Abolish "traitorous" treaties – the CCP treaties and related conventions of 1945 should also be considered in the overall review of foreign policy. (6) Hold a political consultative conference and organize a coalition government – acceptable, but the composition of the CPPCC and the coalition government, as well as other details, still need to be discussed.

Editorial

### Pleading for the Countless Suffering Students!

The winter vacation is over! The short vacation will soon be over, and the first semester of the thirty-eighth year of spring will begin. In today's world of soaring prices and difficult living conditions, the tuition issue for the next semester is a serious threat to middle- and lower-income families. Most college and high school students are also worried about this serious problem, worrying about the tuition for the next semester and panicking about impending unemployment. In principle, studying is a right that the next generation of young people should enjoy, and our Constitution also has clear provisions. However, in today's world of multiple difficulties, in addition to basic education, it is impossible for us to expect the government to fully assume the responsibility of educating the next generation of young people; therefore, rescuing young people who have dropped out of school must depend on the efforts of all sectors of society. In view of this, our newspaper has decided to continue to run the Reader Scholarship Fund, and from now on, we appeal to people from all walks of life to generously donate to help students in need, hoping to raise one million yuan in scholarship funds within a month to rescue five or six hundred young people who have dropped out of school.

Our newspaper has been running the Reader Scholarship Fund campaign since the Anti-Japanese War, and has run eight or nine sessions so far. Each session has rescued hundreds of young people who have dropped out of school, up to thousands of people, rescuing many students in need. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, our newspaper colleagues believed that it was necessary to hold this kind of social relief undertaking again. Since the autumn of the thirty-sixth year, this is now the fourth time. Fortunately, enthusiastic people from all walks of life have upheld the principle of "helping students is the most enjoyable" and generously donated large sums of money, rescuing no less than tens of thousands of young people who have dropped out of school, allowing them to continue their studies and complete their studies. Looking back at the situation of running the scholarship fund in the past, we cannot but thank the generosity of our readers for such a successful achievement. However, at the same time, we believe that there were shortcomings in the last scholarship fund, firstly because the prescribed procedures were too complicated and too slow, which was contrary to the original intention of helping students, and secondly because the malignant inflation of currency caused the value of the raised scholarship fund to fall too much, so that the recipients could not get much benefit. We cannot but consider this situation to be imperfect. This kind of situation must not happen again in the future scholarship fund. Therefore, our newspaper's first scholarship meeting decided to change the method:

First, private colleges and high schools in this city have decided to charge tuition fees in rice for the next semester, and our scholarship fund should also be based on rice. Therefore, it is decided to subsidize each junior high school student with one dan of Zhongbai japonica rice, each high school student with one dan and two dou, and each college student with one dan and five dou. At this time of uncertain situation, the inflation of the gold yuan is inevitable. In order to preserve the currency value, all donations are calculated in kind. In other words, the scholarship funds raised each day will be immediately used to purchase rice in the market and stored in rice shops; the scholarship funds will also be paid in rice in the future. In this way, not only can the currency value be preserved, but also the recipients can get practical benefits. The shortcomings of the previous session will not happen again.

Second, although our newspaper runs the scholarship fund voluntarily, it has cooperated with the Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee in the past three sessions. Unfortunately, the committee's review takes a long time, and the schools' compilation of the list of free students often takes a long time, so that when the scholarship fund is issued, the currency value has fallen too much, so that the recipients cannot get much benefit, and those who donate large sums of money are even more disappointed because they cannot achieve the purpose of rescuing young people who have dropped out of school. If this situation is not changed, it will inevitably affect the fundraising of scholarship funds in the future. Therefore, our newspaper's scholarship fund will resume its initiative from this session and run it independently. As soon as school starts, we will automatically review the qualifications and academic performance of applicants from major colleges and high schools, and after deciding, we will issue the scholarship fund as soon as possible, and copy this list to the Unified Review Committee for reference to avoid duplication. In this way, although our newspaper runs it independently, it will not hinder the work of the Unified Review Committee.

In short, the scholarship fund campaign is the most meaningful social relief undertaking at present. On the one hand, we require the procedures to be as perfect as possible, and on the other hand, we hope that people from all walks of life can extend a compassionate hand, generously donate large sums of money, purchase and store rice for students, and rescue countless students in need to avoid displacement and dropping out of school. Rescuing one more student in need today will also save one more point of vitality for the next generation. Therefore, we want to plead for the countless suffering students to all sectors of society again!

### If China Forms Two Camps, the United Nations Will Encounter Difficulties; It Is Feared That It Will Shake the Foundation of the United Nations

[Associated Press, Chenggong Lake, 18th] China's split into two major camps, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, has become the biggest problem for the United Nations. Many United Nations diplomats are currently studying this issue. If the CCP announces the establishment of a government, and the National Government still claims to be the only legal regime in China, how should it be handled? One UN official said: Even if the mathematical genius Albert Einstein were alive, he would probably be dumbfounded and not know what to do. At the San Francisco Conference, at the insistence of the United States, all countries recognized China as one of the five powers, occupying a permanent seat on the Security Council and enjoying veto power. China is also a permanent member of the Trusteeship Council, and participates in the Economic and Social Council, as well as attending more than a dozen second-tier United Nations organizations. If the CCP controls the whole country, and the National Government surrenders the whole country, the solution is simple and easy, but it is not a blessing for Western countries. The communist China will then stride into the Security Council, and use its veto power to assist the Soviet Union, so that the Soviet Union, which has used too much veto power, can have a little rest. The CCP will also take over all the positions of the current government in the United Nations. However, the United Nations' dilemma is that once the National Government moves its capital to Taiwan and fights to the end in a semi-exile way, the United Nations will face the issue of which government represents China. Thousands of officials believe that this matter will shake the foundation of the United Nations. Since Western countries have an overwhelming majority in the United Nations General Assembly and various organizations, even if the CCP intends to do something, it is not difficult to defeat it. However, only a few people think that the solution is so simple. If there is no rift between the United States and the Soviet Union, the choice between the CCP government with 440 million miles and the powerless National Government is obvious. However, if this matter occurs in the current situation, and the United Nations must consider it, it is another matter. If the West wants the National Government to maintain its seat, it will be very difficult to explain to the countries of the world.

### Indonesian Government Asks Asian Conference for Effective Aid to Indonesia, Sends Letter to Nehru Condemning Security Council's Weak Attitude, Representatives of Various Countries Arriving in India Have Begun Contact

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 18th] The Indonesian provisional government established in Sumatra has sent a letter to Indian Prime Minister Nehru stating: We request that the Asian Conference convened on the 20th intervene in the conflict between Indonesia and the Netherlands in order to find appropriate methods to resolve this issue. It also stated that the Security Council cannot do anything for this issue other than the activities of the mediation committee for the conflicting parties. Considering Indonesia's years of resistance against Japan, Dutch aggression, and the fight against colonial policies, the Indonesian provisional government also requested the Asian Conference to provide Indonesia with the effective assistance it deserves.

[Associated Press, New Delhi, 17th] Indonesian Republican officials said today that after the Asian countries conference initiated by Indian Prime Minister Nehru opens here on the 20th, the Indonesian delegation will formally propose economic sanctions against the Netherlands. The Indonesian Republic has submitted a memorandum to it, stipulating the timetable for the withdrawal of Dutch troops, the organization of a provisional government, and the establishment of an Indonesian Federation. If the United Nations agency cannot stop the continued aggression of the Dutch, the countries participating in the Asian Conference must prohibit Dutch airplanes and ships from carrying ammunition or troops from their territories, and provide Indonesia with material and financial assistance.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 18th] Representatives from various Asian countries participating in the Southeast Asian Conference have now arrived in New Delhi one after another. Representatives of various countries are now making informal contacts in New Delhi. It is reported that private consultations between representatives will be held in the palace of the King of Hyderabad in New Delhi, while the opening ceremony and formal meetings will be held in the Indian Parliament Building. According to observers, representatives of various countries have reached agreement on several points of principle regarding the Indonesian issue. On the other hand, it is believed that there are currently two things that cause concern to the conference participants: (1) the victory of the Communist Party in China; (2) the fear that the new Indian imperialism will replace Western imperialism.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 18th] Filipino representative Romulo, who participated in the Southeast Asian Conference, told the press on the 17th that convening this conference is a bold political move, and therefore an effective way for Southeast Asia to achieve peace. He also said that this conference will create a great achievement of historical importance, as it is the first time such a conference has been held.

Many groups have been established in the world, such as the Western Alliance, the Pan-American Group, and the Atlantic Treaty.

### Indonesian Issue Ends General Debate, Four Countries to Submit New Proposals Today, Indonesia Urges Security Council to Take Action Before the 20th

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 17th] According to well-informed sources, after the Security Council resumes its meeting on the 19th, China will jointly propose a resolution on the Indonesian issue with the United States, Norway, and Cuba. It is heard that the four countries have no fundamental differences of opinion on the content of the proposal. The proposal is largely the same as the draft secretly notified to various countries by the United States last Friday, with only slight revisions. The Security Council has completed the general debate on the Indonesian issue today, but has not taken action.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 18th] It is reported that the US delegation to the Security Council is drafting a proposal for the United Nations to supervise the gradual withdrawal of Dutch sovereignty in Indonesia. Security Council representatives are eager to decide on action on the 19th in order to prevent the possibility of the Asian countries conference convened in New Delhi on the 20th from automatically adjudicating the event in view of the lack of action by the Security Council. India, in its capacity as the host of the New Delhi conference, has repeatedly assured that any action will be included in the United Nations organization, but Indian Ambassador Lei He wants the Security Council to expedite action so that the New Delhi conference can begin in a "different atmosphere." US Representative Jessup agreed with Lei He's point of view, "There was originally a very large agreement among the Security Council member states on the Indonesian issue. It would still be unfortunate if the possibility of this agreement was diluted due to disagreement on any details." Jessup also agreed with the view of Indonesian representative Bila that "It would still be unfortunate if we take an incomplete resolution." According to the rules of procedure, the United States needs to obtain the support of seven countries in the Security Council in order to pass any resolution. Therefore, the United States may have to make some slight revisions to its position in order to obtain a guarantee of passage. It is generally believed that the US proposal should include Jessup's proposed "schedule" and most of the points raised by Lei He on the 17th. It is reported that the United Kingdom will support this proposal, while the Soviet Union believes that the greatest crisis lies in France. If the resolution is worded too strongly, France may exercise its veto power. Previously, France had exercised its veto power once in the Indonesian incident.

Bevin said that the armistice negotiations between the Egyptian and Israeli delegations have also made considerable progress, and the representatives of the two countries are also consulting with "other relevant countries" (referring to Arab countries).

### The United States Should Strengthen Its Air Force to Deal with Future Wars

The View Held by Most Congressmen

[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] Navy Minister Sullivan said that the Navy needs more funding. The political report said that the Navy Department needs more funding to keep pace with the atomic age. It is estimated that the funds needed before the end of June this year will exceed the original amount by 1 billion yuan. The Navy Department cannot continue to reduce equipment to invest: Under the current difficult situation, all scheduled plans cannot be completed. Technological advancements have greatly increased the speed, range, power, and efficiency of weapons, aircraft, and warships. Maintaining a strong navy to prevent attacks in the future will cost a lot. The navy is a major part of national defense and will continue to cooperate with the army and air force to exert its military power to deal with any aggression. However, some senators believe that the Air Force is more important than the Navy. According to Hill, a Democratic member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, if defense spending is increased, the increased portion must be given to the Air Force. Thomas, chairman of the Military Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, also said that he firmly believes that future wars will be based on air power. It is expected that the Air Force will soon become the foundation of the US military construction. According to Taft, chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, on the whole, I do not oppose expanding the Navy. The Navy should be kept modern, but the proposed budget of 4 billion yuan is too much. According to President Truman's recent budget message to Congress, he advocated a defense expenditure of 14 billion yuan this year, which will be shared by the Army, Navy, and Air Force.

### Czech Exile Leaders Form New Organization in America to Participate in the Cold War Against the Soviet Union; Anti-Government Conspiracy Uncovered in Prague, Many Arrested

[United Press, Washington, 17th] Czech exiled political leaders plan to organize a new anti-Soviet organization in America within the next three weeks to participate in the Cold War against the Soviet Union. Although the organization of this institution is proceeding informally, the U.S. State Department has at least tacitly approved it. Former Czech Deputy Prime Minister Zenkl, who fled to the United States last summer, is the chairman of the preparatory committee for the "Free Czech Committee." The committee is expected to be formally established in early February, with the goal of assisting Czech refugees within the Western sphere, making contact with non-communist elements within the Czech Republic, and working to restore a democratic Czech state. Since the recent arrival of Czech Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Hejtmar in this country, the activities of Czech leaders have become even more active. Hejtmar reported to the State Department that the Communist Party has now completely controlled Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union is transforming Czechoslovakia and Poland into industrial centers in order to extract their products for its own construction. There are no signs of preparation for an invasion war by Soviet troops in the Czech Republic.

Czech exiled politicians have joined a large group of exiled politicians and civil servants from other countries, preparing to one day return to non-communist countries. In other words, Washington, like London and Paris, has become a center for anti-communist exiled governments, with various contacts penetrating deep into the Eastern European underground.

General Gottwaldser, former commander of the Moravian military region, is among them and has been under arrest for quite some time. Communist leaders have bitterly denounced Prague for becoming a battleground for ideological warfare of the Cold War.

### "Deng Keng" and "New Ruian" Ships Collide at Wusong Port; Passengers Fortunately Unharmed

[This newspaper] The "New Ruian" ship of the Ruian Company, with a gross tonnage of 919 tons, operating on the Shanghai-Fuzhou line, sailed from Fuzhou to Shanghai on the 16th of this month, carrying over 400 tons of cargo and 129 passengers. Yesterday afternoon at approximately 1:00 PM, upon arrival at Wusong Port and while proceeding inward, the "Deng Keng" ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was calibrating its compass in Wusong Port. Unexpectedly, the two ships collided. The rear cabin on the starboard side of the "New Ruian" ship was damaged and breached, and water immediately entered. Upon receiving the news, the captain immediately increased speed and steered toward a shallow area, running aground on a sandbar, avoiding sinking. An emergency call was immediately sent out. Because the location was near the first buoy near the Wusong Port exit (i.e., the Lismore Channel), the Harbor Quarantine Station, Jianghai Customs, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and others immediately dispatched tugboats and other vessels stationed at Wusong to rescue the passengers. All passengers from the "New Ruian" ship were safely rescued and transported back to Shanghai on small boats from the Harbor Quarantine Station and other organizations. The Ruian Company immediately hired two iron barges from the China Transport Company to unload the cargo and then find a way to tow the ship to Shanghai for repairs. According to the report from the "Deng Keng" ship, it was calibrating its compass in Wusong Port at the time, and upon encountering the "New Ruian" ship entering the port, it sounded its horn twice, and the "New Ruian" ship also responded twice. However, at that time, it was near Shigen Reef, and it was impossible to reverse the ship. Furthermore, due to strong winds and rapid currents, the collision occurred. The "Deng Keng" ship was sailing to Hong Kong and Bangkok, carrying approximately 2,000 tons of goods such as gauze. It set sail from the anchorage outside the port at 2:00 PM on the 17th, originally planning to calibrate its compass yesterday before sailing south. Unexpectedly, the accident occurred. The bow of the ship was also slightly damaged at a depth of 9 feet. It is temporarily anchored at Wusong Port awaiting inspection. If there is no major damage, it will sail south immediately; otherwise, it will return to Shanghai for repairs. The issue of liability for the collision will be determined after investigation by the Shanghai Maritime Administration.

### Uncertainty Remains Regarding Oil and Coal Distribution; Public and Educational Personnel to be Held Responsible

Among the five-item coupon issued by the Shanghai Municipal Public and Education Personnel Materials Supply Committee to public and educational personnel for the distribution of rice, coal, cooking oil, sugar, and salt, the distribution of coal and cooking oil is often delayed. In particular, the cooking oil that should have been supplied by the China Vegetable Oil Plant has not been distributed for three months, from November of last year to this month. The coal that should have been supplied by the Four Mines Joint Operations Office was uniformly converted to cash subsidies in November of last year, with a value of only one-third of the market price at that time. The distribution has not occurred in December and this month either. Public and educational personnel across the city have expressed deep indignation and will hold the Public and Education Personnel Materials Supply Committee accountable.

### Municipal Public Buses Once Cease Operations This Morning; Company Decides to Advance Year-End Bonus; Workers Resume Work after Persuasion

[This newspaper] Workers at the Municipal Public Transport Company briefly went on strike this morning, demanding the early supplementary issuance of the insufficient portion of the year-end bonus calculated based on this month's index. All bus stations ceased operations at 8:30 AM. After persuasion from company authorities and the company's Workers' Welfare Association, work resumed at around 10:00 AM, and by 11:00 AM, vehicles at all stations had returned to normal operation.

According to the company's Welfare Association, the company's year-end bonus was previously calculated based on 18.3 times the December index of last year and had already been issued. Subsequently, the company authorities, complying with the workers' request for the same treatment as the six major public utilities, recalculated the year-end bonus based on this January's index and made a preliminary payment of 30 times the amount. Yesterday was the day to supplement the 11.7 times portion (because 18.3 times had already been issued). It was originally scheduled to supplement another 18.04 times on the 22nd of this month to reach a total of 48.04 times. However, the workers, in view of the escalating prices and the more than doubling of the household rice price starting yesterday, suffered significant losses. Although the Welfare Association had notified the workers to purchase household rice before the 17th, the workers could not afford it at the time, resulting in delays. Therefore, the workers were very indignant about this yesterday morning, and the public's emotions were also agitated. The increase in the household rice price can be said to be the immediate cause of this strike.

As a result, both parties agreed: the 11.7 times portion of the year-end bonus will still be issued yesterday, the remaining 18.04 times will be issued early on the 20th, and the salary for the second half of this month will be advanced to the 24th.

If there is no private seal, the post office will affix the date stamp on the spot. If the sender includes banknotes in a registered and insured letter without declaring it to the post office or if the declared amount is inaccurate, and the post office staff suspects something, they must verify it in person or, after receiving the letter, directly notify the delivery office to inform the recipient to open and retrieve the contents in person. If it is confirmed that there is non-declaration or underreporting, the recipient will be charged double the remittance fee for the full amount or the difference. The Municipal Postal Administration and its affiliated branches, inland offices, and Jiangwan Postal Affairs Office have all determined to start accepting these letters from tomorrow.

### Two Major Fires in the South City in the Morning and Evening; Squatter Huts on Fuxing East Road and Outside Xian Gua Street Unfortunate; Each Destroyed Over a Hundred Units, Many Dead and Injured

[This newspaper] At 9:30 PM last night, a major fire broke out on Chuanjia Street, Fuxing East Road, in the South City, destroying over a hundred squatter huts. The fire started in a squatter hut owned by a certain person behind the Manlita Bridge Police Station of the Yimiao Branch of the Public Security Bureau on Fuxing East Road. After the fire started, it spread extremely quickly due to the strong northwesterly wind. After spotting the fire, the South City Firefighting Federation Lookout immediately notified the Fire Department and the firefighting associations of various sections in the South City to dispatch vehicles to extinguish the fire. However, water sources were scarce in the area, so within half an hour, all the squatter huts in the area were engulfed. The area ranged north to Xuexian Street, east to Guangqi Road, west to Chuanjia Street, and south to Fuxing East Road. Fortunately, nearby residential buildings were spared thanks to high walls. The fire gradually subsided at 10:30 PM. When the fire was raging, squatter Wang Deqing, his wife Zhou, and their young son Wang Didi were burned and sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, Wang's five-year-old son Wang Amao did not escape and was buried in the flames.

[This newspaper] The squatter huts outside Xiaodongmen, Xian Gua Street, in the South City, were densely packed, totaling over a thousand units. Unexpectedly, at approximately 7:30 AM yesterday morning, Ding Kehua, a firecracker manufacturer in squatter hut number 229 in the alleyway, was careless. Due to the strong wind, the gunpowder caught fire and quickly became a conflagration. The Yimiao Police Branch, which was located nearby, was notified and Branch Chief Qi Jingzhi telephoned the firefighting associations of various sections in the South City, as well as the firefighting branches in Songshan and Xin Kaihe, all of whom dispatched pumper trucks to put out the fire. However, the streets in the area were narrow, and some fire hydrants were frozen, so firefighters had to draw water from the Huangpu River and intensify pumping from unfrozen hydrants, making firefighting extremely difficult. Fire Chief Zhang Qian also arrived on the scene to direct operations. After an hour of efforts to extinguish the fire, it gradually subsided. Unburned shacks were pulled down to prevent the fire from spreading. The fire was completely extinguished at approximately 9:00 AM. It was estimated that over a hundred shacks were destroyed. Afterward, firefighters dug out two bodies from the rubble, one large and one small. The larger one was approximately forty years old, and the smaller one was only a few years old.

### Reopening of the Stock Exchange; General Prediction After the Lunar New Year

Therefore, today, he hopes that the graduating brothers and sisters of the next generation will awaken, innovate, be real rather than hypocritical, be fair rather than selfish, so that everyone can move uphill, enabling the country to get on track and achieve a bright and brilliant future. Following this, Shen Yizhen, the principal of Shanghai Provincial Middle School, who had just returned from an educational inspection in England, gave a speech, detailing the progress and development of equal educational opportunities, educational policies, educational technology, and educational systems in British secondary education. After the speech, all the graduating students sang the graduation song. Director Li of the Education Bureau personally presented diplomas.

[Taibao News] The Shanghai District Children's Emergency Relief Work Review Committee recently stated that regarding the fact that children in child care institutions are having difficulty getting enough to eat due to high prices, the committee's relief target is mainly the children already housed in various child care institutions. The Ministry of Social Affairs and the United Nations stipulate a daily supplementary meal providing 500 calories of food, which has been correctly calculated by experts. However, the committee is unable to provide the entire amount due to regulations and is therefore not fully responsible.

In addition to vegetable money being issued every ten days and firewood being issued every month, the remaining milk powder, soybeans, rice, fat, and salt are issued every three months.

### Three Perpetrators Who Incited Gamblers to Rob Sentenced to Imprisonment

[Taibao News] Fan Guozhu and Qian Yuchun, who were addicted to gambling, met their friend Li Miaosheng at the Yile Theater one night last winter after losing at gambling. Li told the two that Shi Xuekun's house behind the Catholic Church had gold jewelry and other items, and after taking them to check the location, Fan and Qian went to rob the house late the next night, stealing a considerable amount of gold jewelry and clothing. They were subsequently arrested by the police and transferred to the court. Yesterday, Judge Guo Zugan of the District Court concluded the trial and sentenced Fan Guozhu and Qian Yuchun to four years of imprisonment for jointly intending to illegally possess other people's property and taking their belongings by violence and coercion, making them unable to resist.

### Military Troops Stationed in Factories; Production Likely to be Affected; Three Groups Telegraph Request for Proper Accommodation Measures

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Industrial Association, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions jointly telegraphed the Municipal Government and the Songhu Garrison Command yesterday, stating that the stationing of military troops in factories and warehouses would affect production and cause shutdowns, requesting that the "Measures for Military Organs and Troops Renting Civilian Houses" promulgated by the Executive Yuan and the regulations on accommodation for the National Army transiting through the country be followed to properly arrange accommodation. The original telegram reads: It has come to our attention that in recent months, the number of troops transferred through or stationed in Shanghai has been greater than usual. After arriving in Shanghai, these troops have failed to comply with the "Measures for Military Organs and Troops Renting Civilian Houses" and the "Measures for Accommodation for the National Army Transiting Through the Country" promulgated by the Executive Yuan. For the most part, they have taken over factories and warehouses on their own.

According to reports from various industries

that have been filed with the Chamber of Commerce, such as the Wuzhou Gu Ben Soap Factory at 5 Jinyi Bridge, Xujiahui, the Xinfu Luan Line Factory at 553 Huining Road, the British Velvet Factory on Weidemei Road, the Xu Songsheng Sauce Garden Warehouse at 90 Yutong Road, and the unfinished civilian houses built by the Guilan Ji Construction Factory on Baoyuan Road, Doushan Road, Zhabei, the Chamber of Commerce has sent telegrams in the names of Hai Zhen, Zi Hui, Zi Zhen, Zi Wen, and Zi Han, reporting to your department

and requesting a transfer for discussion

and immediate evacuation. To date, not a single place has been returned, and the number of troops arriving in Shanghai is increasing day by day. In the past, factories that were about to start construction were partially occupied (such as the British Velvet Factory). Later, factories that were already in operation were also occupied as a matter of course (such as the Wuzhou Gu Ben Factory and the Xinfu Luan Line Factory), making it difficult to manage the mixed military and industrial operations, and fear is unavoidable, which will inevitably lead to forced shutdowns. At a time when defense deployments are being intensified, the occupation continues to occur. I fear that before the flames of war reach Shanghai, a large number of workers will have no work to do, which will

affect production

and affect the overall situation. I believe that at a time of tense circumstances, there is "tangible defense" and "intangible defense." Intangible defense lies in the peace of farmers in their fields, the peace of merchants in their markets, and the peace of workers in their factories, so that the four peoples can live in peace in their respective professions, and the seven don't be surprised, and the peace is undisturbed. Otherwise, the current emergency loans will become nothing more than empty gestures, and at this time of hardship, a sudden increase in the number of unemployed workers will add to the anxieties. If it is due to a lack of barracks in the military area and a lack of public houses, your department should follow the provisions in the second half of Article 4 of the measures for accommodation for the National Army transiting through the country (that is, building sheds), and properly arrange for accommodation. Settling people's hearts is the way to consolidate morale. We respectfully submit this sincere appeal as a humble offering, hoping that it will be considered, approved, and implemented. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Industrial Association, Federation of Trade Unions, together kowtow, Zi Xiao.

### Accusation and Arrest for Performing Abortion for Prostitute

### Finance Minister Xu Receives Representatives from the Financial Community to Explain the Contents of Gold Public Bonds; Hopes for Support and Assistance from the Financial Community

[Our Newspaper] Finance Minister Xu Kan received representatives from the domestic and foreign financial community in the city at the National Bank Conference Room at 5:00 PM yesterday. Attendees included Song Hanzhang, Huo Baoshu, Qin Runqing, Zhao Dihua, Wang Zhixin, Xu Jiqun, Wang Xiaolai, Gu Shanchang, Shen Rixin, Xu Guomao, and Arnold, a representative of Citibank, and Stans, a representative of HSBC, and others. First, Xu explained the contents of the gold short-term public bonds, saying that the bond fund would be transferred to the Fund Management Committee on the date of issuance. The storage and management of this fund would be handled entirely by the Management Committee, so the creditworthiness of the bonds was extremely reliable. He hoped that the financial community would support the government's policies and provide assistance in various ways. He said that suggestions would be adopted as much as possible. Regarding the resumption of stock exchange and the reasonable reorganization of old public bonds, the Ministry of Finance would be responsible for handling them.

After Xu's speech, the attendees stood up one after another to express their opinions. Song Hanzhang and Zhao Dihua both stated that gold public bonds were reliable and trustworthy and believed that they could gain the trust of the people. Xu Jiqun believed that organizing a syndicate to sell public bonds was indeed the duty of banks, but today, floating capital did not go through banks, so its strength was limited. He hoped that the stock exchange could be resumed immediately to open up a new outlet for floating capital and that gold public bonds could be listed to make trading more flexible, so that sales could be smooth. In his speech, Wang Xiaolai said that the industrial and commercial communities had always supported government orders and would do their best to promote sales. He also hoped that the government would understand the suffering of the people and put the interests of the people first in everything. Stans, a representative of a foreign bank, said in his speech that China's financial measures were closely related to foreign banks. The gold public bonds had excellent conditions, and he hoped that all parties would cooperate to achieve great results. The reception ended at 6:30 PM, and Finance Minister Xu took a car back to Nanjing last night.

The tightness intensified sharply before noon, making turnover extremely difficult. The implicit interest rate on overnight loans rose from 80 yuan per day to over 100 yuan at one point. The market price varied depending on the need, approaching chaos.

Cash leverage was particularly tight in yesterday's market, as many internal institutions had already used it to pay the Central Bank's security deposits. Yesterday morning, customers were largely unable to withdraw funds. Due to the current situation, there were clear signs of capital fleeing south. Large bills were discounted at around 6%.

Further news: The prices of all commodities, except for rice, fell across the board. The interest offered in various markets varied. The rubber market once reached around 100 yuan, while the silk and cotton yarn markets also stood high between 80 and 90 yuan. Only the rice market had a uniquely low price, ranging from 60 to 70 yuan.

Since the abolition of the gold and silver exchange system, it has been rumored in the market that the Central Bank is secretly selling large amounts of gold on the market to help tighten the money supply. Responsible parties at the National Bank claimed to be unaware of the above news, neither acknowledging nor denying it.

### Sharp Decline in Silk Prices

Yesterday's rayon market experienced a sharp downturn. Monetary supply in the market was extraordinarily tight, with daily interbank lending rates as high as 100 yuan per thousand, which many found unbearable. Liquidations were frequent, and the market closed with a general decline.

The 120 Bridge opened in the morning with a low price of 66,000 yuan. After opening, news of rising gold prices calmed sentiment, and the market slightly improved, with activity increasing and prices rising slightly by 500 to 1,000 yuan. Subsequently, the monetary supply suddenly tightened, foreign exchange certificates continued to fall, and the black market for finance also shrank. Buying interest dissipated, and by noon, various groups believed that the decline could not go any further and renewed their buying interest. The downward trend finally stabilized, closing at 66,500 yuan, a drop of around 10,000 yuan.

Raw silk was affected by the repeated decline in foreign exchange transfer certificates. The prices of various external goods deteriorated, sentiment weakened, and it was impossible to raise prices. Market buying interest was especially scarce, and trading was thin. Top-grade silk opened at a low price of 76,000 yuan, and transactions were not brisk. The market was weak.

Yesterday, the silk weaving market also experienced a sharp decline. Buying interest in the market was sluggish, and sales were continuous, with retail investors especially eager to sell. Top grades lacked the strength to rally. The market opened low, with Meiya quoting 43,500 yuan in the morning. The market softened slightly in the middle, and finally, external prices universally declined. The financial black market initially weakened then rose, before softening again. Sentiment was overwhelmingly bearish, and the market declined further, closing at 42,800 yuan at noon, a drop of around 1,000 yuan.

### Textile Construction Continues Selling, Cotton Yarn Trends Downward, Cloth Sales Sluggish and Selling Pressure Pervasive

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Corporation continued to sell yarn on behalf of the National Bank and the US Aid Committee. Affected by the tight monetary supply, the market for yarn narrowed. Only 39 customers purchased a total of 215 bales, all of which were allocated at a price of 10,251,000 yuan.

Yesterday, yarn was offered for sale in five rounds. As a result, 82 bales of 20-count Double Globe were sold at 39,000 yuan per bale. 73 bales of 42-count Double Strand Blue Phoenix were sold at 64,000 yuan per bale. 19 bales of 20-count Gold Double Horse were sold at 38,000 yuan per bale. 3 bales of 40-count Red Douguang were sold at 59,000 yuan per bale. 38 bales of 20-count Heavenly Maiden were sold at 39,000 yuan per bale.

The company also sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 9,370 bolts and 10,500 pounds of cloth, with 440 purchase orders and a recovered price of 16,505,400 yuan.

The cotton yarn market was weak, and the prices of most external goods trended downward. Sales to other ports further narrowed, and coupled with the unprecedentedly tight monetary supply, cargo owners were eager to sell due to high interest rates. There was continuous selling pressure in the market, while buyers were bearish and reluctant to enter the market. As a result, trading within the market was sparse.

42-count Blue Phoenix initially opened at 69,000 yuan, once dropping to 65,000 yuan before closing at 68,000 yuan, a drop of 7,000 yuan from the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix experienced a significant drop of 12,000 yuan, and 32-count Silver Moon ultimately fell by 9,500 yuan, closing at 5,300 yuan.

Spot 1-count Double Horse fell from 47,000 yuan to a low of 45,000 yuan, before recovering to the 50,000 yuan level at noon, a drop of 4,000 yuan. Factory orders once approached the 40,000 yuan level, before ultimately settling at 41,500 yuan, a drop of 5,500 yuan. One-day arbitrage initially traded at 4,000 yuan, but at noon, some were willing to sell at 2,500 yuan. Trading in other yarns was sluggish, and the market softened accordingly.

Cloth sales were sluggish, and the monetary supply in the market was even tighter, with daily interest rates around 1 yuan. As a result, merchants were under pressure from high interest rates and eager to sell. Selling pressure in the market suddenly intensified, but there were few buyers. As a result, various markets experienced a uniform and sharp decline.

First-grade fine cloth initially quoted 1,950 yuan. Ultimately, it was around 1,800 yuan. Five Happiness fine cloth declined from 1,900 yuan to 1,840 yuan, a final drop of 4,330 yuan. Trumpet Child fine cloth fell by 480 yuan, closing at 1,620 yuan. Other grades such as B First-Grade and Big Double Dragon all fell by 300 to 400 yuan.

Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji initially opened at 1,770 yuan, reaching a high of 1,800 yuan. Before closing, it had fallen to 1,650 yuan, before closing at 1,660 yuan, a drop of 80 yuan from the previous day. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong declined by 500 yuan, and other markets followed suit.

### Government Launches Large-Scale Sales of Materials to Stabilize Prices with Confidence

After the heads of the Ministries of Finance, Industry and Commerce, Food, and Accounting convened a meeting on prices in Shanghai, concrete decisions have been made regarding future policies for stabilizing prices.

According to Minister of Industry and Commerce Liu Weizhi, who attended the meeting, the government has decided to stabilize prices by selling materials and tightening the money supply. The government currently controls a large amount of rice, coal, yarn, and foreign exchange certificates, which provides confidence in controlling prices. In the future, relevant agencies will closely coordinate and make large-scale sales as needed. Control over the financial commodity market will also be closely monitored. Furthermore, the prices of public utilities will be stabilized to avoid stimulating inflation. The technical issues of opening the securities market are currently being studied. The main point is how to make securities trading play a role in absorbing idle funds and assisting the development of industry and commerce, while eliminating speculative activities. For this purpose, the margin for securities trading needs to be raised to 75% to 100%. Once the technical issues have been resolved, the resumption of business can be realized. Liu Weizhi is scheduled to return to Beijing by night train on the 18th.

### Ministry of Finance Separately Stipulates the Amount of Cash Travelers Can Carry Domestically and Internationally

1,000 Yuan to Hong Kong, 4,000 Yuan to Taiwan and Guangdong

Regarding the amount of Gold Yuan banknotes that travelers can carry into the country, to foreign regions other than Hong Kong and Macau, and from various places in the country to various ports in Guangdong Province, as well as the limit on cash carried to and from Taiwan and other domestic ports, it is known that the Shanghai Financial Management Office has received telegrams from the Ministry of Finance stipulating the following separately:

(1) The cash limit for travel to Hong Kong and Macau has been raised to 1,000 Gold Yuan banknotes per person. Those carrying Gold Yuan banknotes into the country or to other foreign regions other than Hong Kong and Macau should follow the same limit as for travel to Hong Kong and Macau.

(2) The cash limit for travel to various places within Guangdong Province should follow the limit for travel to Guangzhou, with a limit of 4,000 Gold Yuan banknotes per person.

### Friendly Soccer Match in Nanshi: Dongxing Wins by One Goal Against Huaguang, Cold Weather and Strong Wind, Over 1,500 Spectators

The Huaguang and Dongxing soccer teams held a friendly match at the sports field yesterday. The weather was cold and the wind was strong, with over 1,500 spectators. Huaguang opened the scoring, but Dongxing responded with two goals, becoming the score at the half, which was also the final result. Huaguang's defense was solid, but their forward line was weaker. Dongxing's players were balanced and strong, and in terms of skill, Dongxing was slightly better. Their attacks were also stronger, so they were able to win 2-1. Both goalkeepers performed well, with Wu Qixiang of Huaguang being the most outstanding. He not only saved many dangerous shots, but also created many attacks. Dongxing's five forwards were active and showed strong penetration, and the defense also had good tactics, especially Li Chengxian and Zheng Bingyi, who were very competent.

In the first half, Huaguang was playing against the wind. Dongxing adopted an offensive strategy from the beginning. After eight minutes, Huaguang broke through the heavy defense, and the ball was sent forward from the right. After Qian Yunqing's pass, Qu Yongfu broke out and scored with a shot, opening the scoring. Afterwards, Dongxing, aided by the wind, continued to pressure Huaguang. Le Dequan and Lu Qitang defended on the left and right, and Wu Qixiang intercepted in the middle. Although Chen Huimin's business was booming, fortunately, there were no leaks. After nineteen minutes, Dongxing's Shi Dafa took a free kick 30 yards from the goal, and Wu Kaimin rushed up and scored with a touch, tying the score at 1-1. Three minutes later, left winger Jiang Xian took a corner kick, and the ball landed perfectly. Zhang Jiliang intercepted it and passed it to Yan Chengkuan, who scored with a powerful shot, reversing the score to 2-1.

After switching sides, Huaguang gained the advantage of playing with the wind, and the situation became more balanced. The game became more intense, with both sides having opportunities to score, creating dangerous moments. In the last ten minutes, Huaguang frequently attacked the goal, but they were too hasty. Goalkeeper Gao Weichen was skillful and did not allow any scores. As a result, the score remained 2-1, and Dongxing won. The lineups for the two teams were as follows: Dongxing

Gao Weichen

Zheng Bingyi Li Chengxian Wu Kaimin Wang Baoshan Shi Dafa Zhang Jingen Jiang Kun Chen Qin Zhang Jiliang Yan Chengkuan Zhang Jiliang Yan Chengkuan Wang Burong

### To Ms. Chen from Zhuji: Attention, Package of Candied Dates to be Claimed

On the 28th day of last month (December), at around 4:00 AM, I took the (102) through train from Hangzhou to Shanghai to Yuanjia. At the Hangzhou City Station, I encountered two women surnamed Chen, carrying a bag of candied dates, claiming to be from Zhuji and going to Shanghai to visit relatives. Because it was difficult to board the train, they asked me to help carry the bag onto the train. At that time, I gladly agreed because I thought it would be difficult for women to squeeze through the crowd, and I told them that my surname was Wang. When the train started moving, I searched for the two women everywhere on the train, but I couldn't find them. When the train arrived at Jiaxing Station, I got off the train and shouted along the train, but no one responded. Since I will be returning to Hangzhou soon, I will deposit the candied dates at Zhu's residence at No. 84 Qingtai Road. I am now writing to respectfully request that you publish the original letter in your newspaper and please also forward it to other newspapers in Shanghai and Hangzhou, so that the owner of the items can come and claim them.

### A Look at Central China

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Fang Canglang

[Report from Hankou, via airmail, 15th] From December 20th of the 37th year of the Republic to New Year's Eve, the climate in various parts of Central China has been cloudy, gloomy, and cold. As a result, people's moods have also become heavier and more melancholic. In fact, the climate here isn't exceptionally cold, and the living environment is normal, not particularly unusual. What clear-headed and discerning people consider unusual are only the following few things:

The People Yearn for Peace, a Universal Chorus

"War is like fire; if not suppressed, it will consume itself." This is a precious teaching left to us by our ancestors. The civil war has now raged for three years, causing the ruin and death of over a hundred million people. The war situation remains difficult to resolve, and the people yearn for peace. Since everyone hopes for a peaceful and stable situation, the call for peace naturally resonates everywhere. General Commander Bai, bearing the responsibility for the safety of Central China, vaguely heard that the President was about to make a new decision on the major issues of peace and war. Therefore, after assessing the overall situation and bowing to the will of the people, he submitted several valuable suggestions to the Central Government in late December. According to sources involved, Bai's suggestions coincided with the President's wishes. Thus, after the President's New Year's Day statement was issued, public opinion in Central China was unanimously supportive, without any dissent. This can be seen in the appeals for peace from people's representative bodies in Hunan and Hubei, etc. Among them, the only relatively radical and uniquely responsive person was Liu Jixue, Speaker of the Henan Provincial Assembly, who issued a telegram in his individual capacity, and a few grumbling words from some elderly people concerned about the times at a symposium calling for peace in Hubei. At the time, they seemed sensational, and after being spread by rumor-mongers, sensitive people discussed them with feigned seriousness. Many impatient people criticized the aforementioned grand old men severely. In fact, this was all unnecessary. It should be known that there is no distinction between old and young among humans who cannot bear the suffering of war. How much more so for these elders who have experienced so much hardship? They have their individual freedom of speech. They highly admire the President's revolutionary achievements and his leadership in the war of resistance, and they deeply believe that President Chiang, who is willing to accept good advice, may accept candid opinions. Indeed, not long after, the President's reply arrived, expressing his acceptance of the elders' opinions. Recently, taking advantage of Political Committee Member Zhang [blank] Ying [blank]'s visit to Hankou, he conveyed the government's painstaking efforts to seek peace and the true state of the current situation, which finally brought the peace movement in the Central China provinces to a state of mutual understanding and consensus.

Don't Burn Incense Before the Bodhisattva Arrives

Now that the atmosphere of peace in Central China has cleared, rumors in Hankou have also decreased. People's topics have shifted back to the three question marks: "peace," "war," and "retreat." This shows the general public's distress. However, from the mouths of some people coming from Nanjing, there are still quite a few comforting good news stories to be heard. What is regrettable is that 京沪报纸 (京沪报纸 refers to newspapers from Nanjing and Shanghai) has been absent for over twenty days. This absurd decision to suspend the transportation of 京沪报纸 gives rumour mongers a better opportunity. No wonder local representatives sighed when they saw reporters, saying, "In these times, it's not easy to get information. Without 京沪报纸, the market situation is naturally unclear. The silver dollar dealers on Hankou's Unified Street will naturally report inflated prices, stirring up trouble. A few people who don't understand the market situation will inevitably engage in 'burning incense before the Bodhisattva arrives' by rushing to buy silver dollars. Why won't the transportation authorities let us see Nanjing newspapers and Shanghai newspapers?"

Speaking of Hankou and silver dollars, it can make public education personnel shiver. The value of silver dollars in Hankou is closely and meticulously tied to commodity prices. This phenomenon has existed for a long time. Initially, it was because manufacturers had to use cash to buy cotton in the production areas, butchers had to use cash to buy pigs in the countryside, and grain merchants had to use cash to buy rice in the production areas. Silver dollars played a leading role in the market. Today, although the gold yuan (a currency) is not dead, people's hearts are dead. The power of silver dollars in the markets of Hankou and even other ports in Central China is unparalleled. All commodity prices must follow them. In the most recent month or so, the black market price of silver dollars in Hankou has risen from 20 yuan to 130 yuan per piece. As silver rises by one foot, commodity prices rise by ten. The silver dollar black market often throws the commodity price white market into chaos. Once commodity prices are pushed up by silver dollars, they cannot fall. In the past three days, Hankou's silver supply has tightened, and silver dollars have fallen back to around 110 yuan, but commodity prices have not fallen. What is most pitiful is that while all commodities are rising in price, public education is the most inexpensive. The lives of public education personnel, who are disconnected from silver dollars, are full of resentment towards silver dollars in the three towns of Wuhan and southern Henan. Especially in Hankou, "silver" is the root of all evil. In these short ten days, thanks to the efforts of the municipal authorities, hundreds of "silver dogs" have been arrested. Although silver dollars are still causing trouble, it cannot be solely blamed on the incompetence or irresponsibility of the current administrative officials. One can only curse "silver dollars should die" and loudly condemn those "scoundrels who used to love silver," to vent one's anger.

### War Zone Students in Jiangxi

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Liu Zao

[Report from Nanchang, via airmail, 15th] War zone students and some faculty members are unwilling to receive poisonous education in communist-controlled areas. They voluntarily left their homes and embarked on a difficult path of escape. Their spirit of perseverance and hardship has aroused the admiration of people from all walks of life and won the sympathy of the people in the rear. Therefore, they have been constantly receiving hospitality from local people along the way of their southward migration. Jiangxi's hospitality and resettlement of transit refugee students has given them the warmth of human sympathy during their arduous journey, and further strengthened their confidence in the inevitable success of suppression and construction.

Unexpected Guests

When the first batch of refugee students from the war zone arrived at Nanchang Railway Station on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, because the Ministry of Education had neither sent anyone to Jiangxi to preside over the reception in advance, nor had it sent a telegram to notify the Education Department, it was not until the students arrived at the South Station that the Education Department received a report from the station stating that a group of war zone students had arrived. They had not eaten, and they did not have extra money to open a hotel at the station to solve the problem of food and lodging for the day. Director Zhou Bangdao of the Education Department, who is known as "Old Master," was really distressed by his "poor coping" at the time, because the Education Department was so poor that it could not even afford fuel for the office stove. Where could he find extra money to deal with this matter in an emergency?

At that time, they gathered all of the money the staff had in their pockets for small dishes and cigarettes to make up a pitifully small sum, and quickly sent someone to the station to receive these "unexpected guests."

However, after the first batch of students was received, the second and third batches kept coming from the east. Then, the Education Department had no choice but to ask Director Zhou to come forward and temporarily borrow a sum of money from the Central Cooperative Treasury, the China Farmers Bank, and several other financial institutions that usually have an interest in social undertakings, as a reception fee, promising to bear the bank's interest, and repaying it within five days.

Reception Work

After obtaining this loan, the reception work was fully launched. A reception center was formally set up at the station, preparing tea, snacks, and meals. Moreover, many students who fell ill on the way were treated by specialists sent by the Health Department to set up a clinic at the station. Chairman Hu Jiafeng of the Provincial Government, Director Zhou Bangdao of the Education Department, social celebrities, and others visited the station from time to time to express their condolences.

The students on the refugee route deeply felt "there is also sympathy in the world" when they received such condolences and reception. Although there were occasional misunderstandings at the station due to the buying and selling of food, the local order was generally peaceful.

According to the Education Department, the total reception fee used to receive refugee students was 23,000 yuan.

Fundraising Measures

The source of this fund was originally planned to have two measures: (1) launch a fundraising campaign in various schools, (2) The Provincial Assembly Speaker Wang Zhenxin and Education Department Director Zhou Bangdao would write letters to major wealthy households to solicit donations. At that time, they believed that the fundraising of the second method should have good results, that is, the two gentlemen Wang and Zhou who were named went to the door to borrow money, and the rich people would also look at their faces, but the fact was completely the opposite.

When the students solicited donations on the streets, they encountered generous people, but they also encountered people's blank stares. With their own enthusiasm, they achieved good results - raising more than 42,000 yuan. In addition, some of the eminent officials received solicitation letters from Speaker Wang and Director Zhou. Apart from one businessman who automatically sent 1,000 yuan to the Education Department, no second person could be compared with him.

### Jiangsu Province's Key Land Administration Promotes Agricultural Land Reform

[Report from Zhenjiang, 17th] In addition to continuing to carry out cadastral surveying, the focus of this year's land administration work in Jiangsu Province will be to promote agricultural land reform. According to Zhang Hui, Director of the Provincial Land Administration Bureau, "We are now collecting relevant materials and formulating simple and easy-to-implement measures, which will be submitted to the Provincial Government for approval before implementation. As for the content of the measures, the actual situation in the occupied areas, semi-controlled areas, and controlled areas will be considered separately, and progress will be set to implement the principle of 'land to the tiller' in order to stabilize the lives of farmers and enhance combat strength. However, it is not enough to solve the difficulties without revolutionary means when implementing it. Four counties in this province, Jiading, Wujiang, Changshu, and Jiangning, have been designated as pilot counties for soil reform, and the progress of the promotion in these four counties will be used as a reference for reform throughout the province."

### Recent State of Public Security on the Border Between Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan (Part 2)

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Liu Mengchi

[Report from Guiyang, via airmail, 9th] Long Tengxiao's machine guns are plentiful, sophisticated, and effective, so the People's Defense Forces are naturally no match for him. The province urgently dispatched a company of the 2nd Regiment of the Provincial Security Forces stationed in Guiyang overnight, and a battalion of the 126th Division of the National Army stationed in Qidong was also sent to assist in the suppression. After about ten days of fierce fighting, both the government and the bandits suffered casualties. Xiong Qiang, the magistrate of Pu'an County, was once captured, and two battalion commanders of the security regiment were wounded. Judging from the situation, more troops will have to be added to eventually prevail, because the number of bandits has been coerced from about a thousand to five or six thousand people. Han Wenhuan, Deputy Commander of the Guizhou Provincial Security Forces, personally went into action, and sent an independent battalion to Panxian. Lu Jie, the commissioner of Xingyi, also led the People's Defense Forces and district security teams from Xingyi, Xingren, and other counties to join the battle line. After such great effort, Long Tengxiao's lair, Nuozhai, was captured on November 27. He led his remaining troops to flee to Haizi, where Panxian meets Pingyi, to continue his stubborn resistance. At present, the opium growers in the area are afraid of the government's military force and have automatically eradicated the seedlings, and public security has gradually recovered. However, it remains to be seen whether Long Tengxiao will make a comeback one day. Chairman Gu Zhenglun advocated that "the border areas are more important than the interior, and preventing bandits is more important than suppressing bandits." Therefore, the bandit suppression troops in Panxian and Pu'an have not yet been demobilized, so as to avoid the resurgence of bandits. Xiong Qiang, the magistrate of Pu'an County, was also dismissed and investigated for "improper handling."

At the intersection of Bijie in western Guizhou, Zhenxiong in eastern Yunnan, and Xuyong in southern Sichuan, the forests are deep and dense, and the mountains are continuous. It can be said that since the mid-Qing Dynasty to the present, the evil forces on the border of the three provinces have always ruled there. Among them, the forces of

Bijie Tusi (Indigenous Ruler)

Yang Zhizhong and Long Chengyao, a local tyrant in Zhenxiong, are the largest. The government has always adopted a policy of appeasement towards them. As long as they can look up to government personnel on the surface, they always take the attitude of "turning big things into small things, and turning small things into nothing." The people in the area have always been afraid of offending these indigenous rulers or local gentry and landlords. In the lower part of November of this year, the Yunnan Provincial Government received an order from the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters, talking about Long Chengyao organizing his "Long Family Class," while persecuting Xu Shifang, Speaker of the County Council, and Li Renfu, a local squire, and at the same time, enticing Luo Renji, the county magistrate, to turn a blind eye to the prohibition, and plant a large amount of opium in the county. He also gathered bandits and gangsters to armed protect the planting. The Yunnan Province was afraid that the idlers in the area would easily be mixed in and used by the communists, so it sent Bai Tianmin, Deputy Commander of the Provincial Security Forces, along with the 126th Division of the Eastern Yunnan Garrison to clean up the countryside, and Luo Renji, the county magistrate, Xu Shifang, the speaker of the county council, and Li Renfu, the local squire were all

Designed to capture and kill

However, the bandit Long Chengyao and others still relied on special forces to escape safely. At the end of November, the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters secretly ordered the authorities of the three provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan to cooperate in arresting Long Chengyao and others for investigation. However, because Long had served as the commander of the Eastern Yunnan Command, he had special ties with the previous and subsequent chief administrators of Yunnan. The Guizhou Province also wanted to find a way to appease him, without "forcing him to join Liangshan." Therefore, in early December of last year, both Yunnan and Guizhou provinces either telegraphed the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters to revoke the arrest warrant for Long Chengyao, or took responsibility for recommending him, asking him to atone for his sins by protecting his homeland. Whether the public security in Bijie, Zhenxiong, Xuyong and other places can be temporarily stabilized recently is of course not. Moreover, the telephone lines in the neighboring counties of Pingyi, Qujing, Zhansheng, Panxian, and Pu'an are often destroyed by those bandits when they rob houses, and the highway traffic is often washed by bandits at the border entrances and exits, and it is impossible to suppress them. The key to not being able to maintain security in the border areas is that it is "using your neighbor as a drain", not to mention that it is suppressing the forces of bandits who are half civilians and half bandits?

The southern Sichuan counties of Junlian, Qi County, and Xuyong are closely adjacent to the two provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou. Bandits often appear in the complex terrain. Because Lu County and Yibin are Yunnan and Guizhou

Opium Smuggling

The export of the station, it is necessary to participate in the organization of the Gelaohui (Brotherhood Society) to "get things done" more easily when selling opium. It is impossible to distinguish between these people and bandits. It is no exaggeration to say that they are a "trinity." It is really not easy to completely eliminate them. Recently, Rongyu (Chengdu and Chongqing) newspapers have repeatedly reported that a large-scale Yiguandao (a syncretic sect) bandit organization was smashed in remote counties in southern Sichuan. The leaders were Chang Zhenzhong and Gao Heguang from Hebei. They entered Sichuan from Beiping and set up altars throughout Sichuan to recruit young men and women and unemployed vagrants to join the religion, and pay huge membership fees. For a time, ignorant men and women flocked to it. The religion has set up branches in various counties in southern Sichuan, and there are also specialists from Beiping coming one after another, which shows that its organization is very large. The Chongqing Pacification Headquarters has ordered the bordering areas of the three provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan to earnestly investigate and arrest them. The Guizhou Provincial Authorities have also agreed with the Sichuan Provincial Authorities to lay telephone networks on both sides of the counties bordering the two provinces in order to facilitate information, and then agree to jointly defend and suppress the roaming bandits. At present, it is reported that there are no bandits gathering to cause harm in the counties of Daozhen, Yanhe, Nanchuan, Qianjiang, Bijie, and Xuyong. The public security in rural areas is still peaceful.

The gentry communists in the Yunnan·Guizhou·Sichuan triangle area, such as Liu Fuchu, Zou Zhengzhong, and He Zhiping, have incited the villagers to revolt for more than ten years. Although He Zhengping has been executed in Kunming, Liu Fuchu and Zou Zhengzhong are still lurking and inciting in this area. It is hoped that the public security authorities in the province will "be prepared for danger in times of peace" and pay attention to it as soon as possible.

Wuxi firewood business owner killed

### News in Brief

Wuxi

[Report from This Newspaper] There are more than 500 criminals detained in the county prison and detention center. The daily food for the prisoners is purchased in Wuxi with funds allocated by the High Court, but the price of food is gradually rising, and the allocated funds are not enough to purchase the predetermined amount, resulting in overspending. Until recently, it was even more impossible to cope. On the afternoon of the 16th, President Ma of the County Court and Warden Xie consulted with the Prison Improvement Association and temporarily borrowed 100 dan of Xian rice for application.

### Management of British State-Owned Enterprises (Part 1)

— Ben Geng

[Special Dispatch from Our London Correspondent, 4th] Since the Labour Party came to power in 1945, major enterprises that have been nationalized, aside from the steel industry which is still undergoing legislative procedures in Parliament, include the Bank of England, civil aviation, coal, electricity, gas, raw cotton (centralized purchasing), and transportation. In addition, the British Broadcasting Corporation (British Broadcasting Corporation) has been transformed into a public management entity since January 1927, but the third license, which came into effect in January 1947, also differs slightly from previous ones.

The purpose of this article is to provide a brief introduction to the management methods of various state-owned enterprises in the United Kingdom. It focuses on the issues and then explains them according to the circumstances of each enterprise.

Starting with the Core Organization

The core organization for the management of various enterprises has different names. Some are called "Corporation," such as broadcasting and civil aviation; some are called "Authority" or "Board," such as electricity and coal; some are called "Commission" or "Council," such as raw cotton, transportation, and gas; and some are called "Court," such as the Bank of England. Although the names of these institutions are not consistent, they generally adopt a committee system. The number of members varies, from seven in the Broadcasting Corporation (including one chairman and one vice-chairman) to eighteen in the Bank of England (including one governor and one deputy governor). Except for the members of the Broadcasting Corporation, who are appointed by the Privy Council, and the Bank of England, who are appointed by the King, the members of the remaining institutions are appointed by the minister in charge. Current members of the House of Commons are not allowed to serve as members of the aforementioned state-owned enterprises. In addition, generally, those who have other professions and whose professional interests are incompatible with a certain state-owned enterprise cannot serve as members of that state-owned enterprise. As for the active qualifications, some enterprises have no restrictions, such as broadcasting, banking, and civil aviation. Most of the others stipulate that those who have knowledge or experience in the relevant business of the respective enterprises. As for the term of office, some have a fixed term, such as the Governor and Deputy Governor of the Bank of England being five years, and the members being four years. Some stipulate that it cannot exceed a certain number of years, such as the Broadcasting Corporation not exceeding five years. Some stipulate the time limit at the time of appointment, such as transportation. Some stipulate that the government minister in charge will specify it, such as coal, electricity, and raw cotton. As for the point of dismissal, some stipulate that they can be dismissed without conditions, such as the Broadcasting Corporation, which can be dismissed by the Privy Council. Some stipulate that if the minister in charge believes that someone is unsuitable, he can declare the position vacant, such as coal and electricity. Some stipulate that the minister in charge can declare the position vacant under certain circumstances, such as civil aviation. Some have no regulations, such as transportation. In terms of salary, the Chairman of the Broadcasting Corporation receives an annual salary of £3,000, the Vice-Chairman £1,000, and the members £600. The Governor of the Bank of England receives an annual salary of £2,000, the Deputy Governor £1,500, and the members £500. The treatment of members of other enterprises is determined by the minister in charge with the consent of the Treasury.

The core organization mentioned above can also be said to be

The Highest Organization of Each Enterprise

In addition to this highest organization, some enterprises also have regional organizations or advisory organizations, which will also be briefly described here.

The so-called regional organization means that some enterprises are in fact distributed throughout the country, so there is naturally a need for "Area Boards". Such regional organizations are found in legal provisions, such as electricity and gas. In the case of electricity, the country is divided into fourteen regions, each with a management organization, which adopts a committee system and is appointed by the minister in charge after consulting the highest organization of electricity. In addition to the chairman, the number of people is five to seven. The gas industry divides the country into twelve regions, also adopting a committee system, with the same number of people as electricity, and appointed by the minister in charge from qualified people stipulated by law. As for the relationship between the regional organization and the core organization, it has a somewhat hierarchical nature. In other words, the scope of activities of the regional organization is not only limited to specific regions, but in fact, it is subject to the guidance and supervision of the core organization, and certain powers are exclusively reserved for the core organization. Another type of organization, which is somewhat similar to regional organizations but is actually different, is the division of the transportation enterprise into five "Executives". In addition to the core organization, the transportation enterprise is divided into five executive departments: "Railways", "Docks and Inland Waterways", "Road Transport", "London Transport" and "Hotels". It also adopts a committee system, with four to eight members in addition to the chairman, who are appointed by the minister in charge from qualified people after consulting the highest transportation organization. The power of this executive agency is entrusted by the highest agency with the consent of the minister in charge.

In addition to the above organization, there is another

Advisory Body

For example, the broadcasting programs of the Broadcasting Corporation are divided into several regions, so there are several "Regional Advisory Councils", and other advisory committees can be established if necessary. The candidates for the Regional Advisory Committee are those who can represent the people of the region. Coal has two consumer committees, one is the "Industrial Coal Consumers' Council" and the other is the "Domestic Coal Consumers' Council", both of which are established by region and appointed by the minister in charge after consulting with interested parties. Its task is to discuss matters related to the supply and demand of coal, and then use it as a reference for the competent authority. Civil aviation has an "Air Transport Advisory Council", in addition to the chairman who must be a qualified lawyer, there are two to four other members, at least one of whom has air transport experience and one of whom has other transport experience. There are now three civil aviation companies in the United Kingdom, each of which must have such a committee. Each district in the electricity sector has a "Consultative Council", with 20 to 30 people, of which 1/2 to 3/5 must be representatives of the local area, and the rest are representatives of various consumers related to electricity. The situation of gas is roughly the same. Transportation has two institutions, one is the advisory committee and the other is the Transport Tribunal. The former is of an advisory or liaison nature, while the latter is an institution for reviewing the nature of transportation costs. The candidates are all related to consumers.

The above is about the organization, and the following will briefly discuss the supervisory methods of the competent department for various state-owned enterprises. Regarding

Supervisory Methods for State-Owned Enterprises

In addition to the appointment and dismissal of personnel, which is actually an indirect supervisory method, in terms of substantive matters, it can be roughly divided into several points: First, in principle, the minister in charge generally retains the power to issue orders to guide the relevant state-owned enterprises. However, the legal provisions for various state-owned enterprises are not exactly the same. Some regulations are concrete, such as broadcasting, the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications may notify the Broadcasting Corporation to stop broadcasting certain programs, and at the same time, when the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications deems it necessary, he may directly use the broadcasting station. Some regulations are more abstract, such as the Bank of England, which stipulates that the Treasury, after consultation with the Governor of the Bank, may issue guidance that it considers to be related to the public interest. Some also stipulate that certain matters must be approved by the minister in charge, such as coal. In addition to similar regulations as the Bank of England, it also stipulates that any reorganization or development related to capital expenditure must be approved by the minister at any time. Second, in terms of finance, borrowing is usually limited, such as the Broadcasting Corporation can only borrow £1 million, and coal can borrow £10 million, but except for acting according to its own power, it must have the permission of the minister. There are a total of three civil aviation companies, each with a different amount that can be borrowed, but it also requires the permission of the Treasury. Other industries such as electricity, gas, and transportation are also generally restricted. At the same time, the accounts are also often subject to some kind of supervision. For example, the annual accounts of the Broadcasting Corporation must be submitted to the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications and must be audited by a registered accountant approved by the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications. Coal, civil aviation, electricity, gas, raw cotton, and transportation are also audited by accountants approved by the competent department. Third, annual reports, the Broadcasting Corporation, coal, civil aviation, electricity, gas, raw cotton, and transportation must submit annual reports every year. And transferred to Congress by the minister in charge.

What is described above is the general situation. Except for the Broadcasting Corporation, which is a "licensed company", the rest are

Commonly known as state-owned enterprises. The Broadcasting Corporation began in 1927, and the rest were nationalized after the Labour Party came to power. Generally speaking, the management of state-owned enterprises in the United Kingdom currently has several characteristics: First, although the organizations of these state-owned enterprises are slightly independent, they are different from general government administrative agencies. However, they cannot be compared with general private companies. The organizations of these state-owned enterprises are mostly subject to quite strict supervision and guidance from the competent department. Second, within the organization, the committee system is generally adopted, and a position such as a chairman is also established. Most of the candidates for the committee have some experience in the industry, in order to collect opinions and benefit widely. At the same time, members of the House of Commons are restricted from holding concurrent positions, so as not to have too close a relationship with politics. Third, these enterprises mostly have advisory bodies. The purpose of these bodies is generally not technical but social. It is hoped that the enterprise organization and the enterprise users can have a chance to cooperate in the right way. Strictly speaking, these methods are all in a process of trial and error. The effect will depend on the proof of future facts.
