### The Prospect of Peace Grows Dim, Government Efforts Remain Unabated, General Zhang Zhizhong Will First Return to Dihua

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The faint hope of peace talks dimmed again on the 26th due to the CCP's broadcast alleging the exposure of "the Nanjing government's sham peace conspiracy." However, the government's efforts towards peace have not slackened. The statement passed by the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 26th, urging the CCP to designate a location and send representatives for negotiations as soon as possible, was still issued as planned in the evening, hoping that the CCP would no longer insist on its own views and prioritize reducing the suffering of the people. However, leading figures here are increasingly concerned about the increasingly harsh attitude of the CCP in its broadcasts over the past two days and its increasingly demanding requests, which have clearly raised concerns about the future of peace talks. Although the broadcast on the 26th was presented in the manner of an observer, it is hard to believe that such expressions were not decided upon and authorized by key CCP figures. Moreover, the accusations against the government agencies and assets moving south, along with speculative interpretations, and the demand to detain so-called important war criminals, are tantamount to adding preconditions before the start of peace talks. It also seems to be a veiled attempt by the CCP to reveal its further intentions. This will make the start of peace talks even more difficult, and the people of the whole country will inevitably feel disappointed.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] A government spokesman stated: In order to end the war as soon as possible and alleviate the suffering of the people, the government has taken various measures and steps since January. On the 22nd of this month, it formally appointed peace talk representatives and has been waiting for the CCP to appoint representatives and agree on a location to conduct negotiations. However, according to the CCP spokesman's remarks broadcast by Xinhua News Agency in northern Shaanxi on the 25th, while claiming to be willing to negotiate a peaceful solution with the government, they wantonly insulted and spoke in a harsh manner, and said: "The location of the negotiations will only be determined after the complete liberation of Beiping." May I ask, if the CCP does not immediately appoint representatives and agree on a location, and does not stop military actions, but instead attributes it to the so-called complete liberation of Beiping, is this not delaying time and prolonging the war? It must be known that the people of the whole country are impatiently hoping to eliminate the scourge of war. In order to show the greatest sincerity, the government still hopes that the CCP will recognize that the premise of today's affairs should be to save the people, and promptly appoint representatives to conduct negotiations so that peace can be realized as soon as possible.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Government peace talk representatives Shao Lizi and Zhang Zhizhong, as well as Li Acting President's personal representative Gan Jiehou, traveled to Shanghai to solicit opinions from various party figures for the sake of peace. They have now completed their mission and returned to Nanjing by plane and train on the 26th. After Shao and Zhang arrived in Nanjing by plane at 9:30 am, they immediately went to the Presidential Palace to report to Acting President Li on the Shanghai trip and exchange views on the attitude of the CCP's broadcast on the evening of the 25th. The Executive Yuan meeting was then moved to the Presidential Palace, and Shao Lizi and others were invited to attend to report in detail on the negotiations with various parties in Shanghai. The meeting then discussed the matter, and the members spoke successively, also discussing the CCP's broadcast on the 25th. It was then decided to issue a statement in response to the broadcast, explaining the government's attitude, hoping that the CCP could promptly propose the time, location, and representatives for the peace talks, and promote the peace talks as soon as possible. The remaining details were then handed over to the peace talk delegation for discussion at a meeting. In the afternoon at 4 pm, President Sun Ke convened the first delegation meeting at his Executive Yuan No. 1 official residence, inviting peace talk representatives Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhong Tianxin, and other political committee members to discuss the delegation's departure and preparations. It is said that the delegation's departure has been hindered by the CCP's continuous broadcasts in recent days and will obviously not be able to depart in a day or two. However, the cabinet, which is very keen on seeking peace, has not been passive in its preparations.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Political Committee member Zhang Zhizhong, who is currently working for peace in the capital, is scheduled to fly to Dihua for a trip in a day or two due to urgent official business in Xinjiang Province, to handle relevant foreign affairs in Xinjiang Province. He will return to Nanjing in a few days, which will not affect the progress of the peace talks. It is also learned that since the reorganization of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, it has made considerable progress in diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in Xinjiang.

### Shaanxi CCP Radio Station Broadcasts Lengthy Message Last Night, A Foreign Observer Believes Peace Talks Have Become Difficult

[This City News] Yesterday (26th) at 6 pm, the Shaanxi CCP radio station broadcast a lengthy message, the main points of which roughly criticized: "The second 'war criminal' of China, the American puppet Li Zongren, and other people in Nanjing who are pretending to be peacemakers are now verbally declaring their acceptance of the eight conditions proposed by the Chinese Communist Party, but is this declaration genuine? Shao Lizi and Zhang Zhizhong are spreading absurd distortions of the eight conditions. Shao and Zhang's statement regarding the 'punishment of war criminals' assumes that Jiang has retired and that the government is now waiting for the Communist Party to state its intentions regarding the other forty-two war criminals on the list. These peace-like conspirators believe that Jiang's departure from Nanjing is tantamount to 'punishing war criminals,' but in reality, this is nothing more than condoning 'war criminals.' Now, the Nanjing Li Zongren government and its collaborators have one way to prove their sincerity for peace, and that is to immediately detain a large group of key 'war criminals,' including Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Tzu-wen, Gu Zhenggang, Chen Cheng, He Yingqin, Gu Zhutong, Liu Zhi, Tang Enbo, Zhang Qun, Wang Shijie, Zhu Jiahua, Liu Jianqun, Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Chiang Ching-kuo, Zhang Junmai, Zuo Shunsheng, Dai Chuanxian, Zheng Jiemin, and Ye Xiufeng, and bring the war criminals abroad to justice. Observers in northern Shaanxi further believe that 'Pseudo Acting President' Li Zongren and 'Pseudo Premier' Sun Ke themselves are key war criminals, and Zhang Zhizhong and Shao Lizi are also lovable figures who support Jiang as 'Pseudo President.' Trying to play tricks is futile. Only if they actually implement the first step of the first of the eight conditions, that is, detain the war criminals and hand them over to the People's Government for trial, will they have the possibility of redeeming their sins." Regarding the above broadcast, the reporter consulted an authoritative foreign observer. According to the answer: If this is the case, the CCP has obviously become more aggressive, attempting to force Acting President Li and Premier Sun to surrender unconditionally. Even Shao Lizi, the "peace elder," and Zhang Zhizhong, the "peace general," who are most enthusiastic about seeking peace, are being insulted, which is truly unimaginable. We outsiders originally thought that the government had indeed made every effort to show its high sincerity in seeking peace. Acting President Li and Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi have successively expressed their willingness to start negotiations based on the CCP's eight conditions and have first dispatched representatives, waiting for the CCP to reply before departing. Unexpectedly, the CCP is making a big fuss about the "war criminals" point and is putting aside Mao Zedong's broadcast that the eight conditions are the basis for peace talks, making Acting President Li feel very difficult. This foreign observer also said that the CCP has not yet formally controlled the government today, but its gaze is already so high. When the coalition government is formed in the future, it will be even more conceivable. Perhaps the CCP today already sees itself as a complete victor and wants to appear before Acting President Li of Nanjing in the posture of "accepting surrender," and after accepting surrender, it will then proceed to try the war criminals, just like the Chinese government's trial of Neiji Okamura today. In fact, the overall situation in China today is no longer a question of whether to make peace or not, but a question of whether Acting President Li's National Government will surrender or not.

### Zhu Jiahua Expresses Views on the Domestic Peace Issue

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Zhu Jiahua, President of the Academia Sinica, recently expressed his views on the peace issue, saying: Peace is something that everyone desires, but the true meaning of peace lies in mutual respect and mutual tolerance between the two sides, and not in one side surrendering to the other. Only in this way can hatred be eliminated and cyclical retaliation avoided, and then can there be long-term stability. Otherwise, a forced temporary peace will inevitably leave future troubles, and I am afraid that the country, society, and the future of the nation, and even mankind, will be unimaginable. Recently, Mao Zedong's statement and the opinions of Li Jishen and 55 others on the current situation all regard this issue as a domestic matter, which should make everything easier to resolve. Unfortunately, what they say is, in nature, the most harsh conditions in an international war, which is quite puzzling. Because of this, the independence and autonomy of the country and nation, the protection of human rights and democratic way of life, and the freedom of cultural thought and academia are all unknown. From this, we can see the seriousness of the problem and the many difficulties ahead, and it is up to us to make active efforts to ensure that true peace can be realized, so that we can be guiltless to future generations.

### Peng Zhaoxian Talks

[Central News Agency, This City News] Peng Zhaoxian yesterday commented on the rumors that he had firmly declined to be a peace talk representative, saying: "This is truly a ridiculous matter. Peace is what the people of the whole country urgently demand, and I am also deeply willing to work for it. Although I was not informed in advance about the government's appointment of me as one of the peace talk representatives, I have never made any statements after the announcement. The news of repeated resignations in the newspapers these days is unknown from where it comes. Now that I have seen the New China News Agency's broadcast in the newspaper, I should consider my position as a representative. In order to promote the smooth progress of the peace talks, I have asked representatives Shao and Zhang to request the government to find other suitable candidates. As for the saying that I am representing a certain faction to participate, it is even more absurd, because I have never been interested in factional issues."

### Professors and People from the Peace Strategy Council Plan to Fly to Beiping to Act Accordingly

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] People from the Peace Strategy Council, composed of professors from various universities in Nanjing, plan to fly to Beiping immediately to seek peace and act accordingly. Sun Yufu and others from the council visited government peace talk representative Zhong Tianxin on the 26th to request the government's facilitation of transportation in order to make the trip. It is said that the results of the contact were very satisfactory.

### Sichuan, Kang, and Yu Jointly Respond to Changes, Rumors of Personnel Adjustments

[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 26th] Wang Lingji visited Liu Wenhui today to discuss specific plans for the joint response to changes in Sichuan, Kang, and Yu, and welcomed Zhang Qun to Chengdu. Otherwise, the two men will go to Chongqing to wait for Zhang to discuss the major plans for Sichuan and Kang. It is widely rumored here that Liu will be transferred to the position of chairman of Sichuan, Wang will be transferred to the position of mayor of Chongqing, Yang Sen will specialize in military affairs, and He Guoguang will serve as chairman of Kang Province.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Decides to Move to Suzhou

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 26th] In order to actively respond to changes, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has decided to move all its offices to Suzhou and evacuate 70% of civil servants to Suzhou, leaving 30% to work in Zhenjiang. It is said that the departments and bureaus will start their journey on the 27th. It is reported that Chairman Ding will not go to Suzhou for the time being in order to quell the people's anxiety in the provincial capital.

### Acting President Li Sends Telegrams to Military and Political Leaders, Encouraging Them to Stay in Their Posts and Hoping They Will State Their Opinions for Selection

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Acting President Li sent telegrams to military and political leaders, provincial chairmen, special mayors, pacification directors, and pacification zone commanders on the 26th, saying: "President Chiang Kai-shek, in consideration of the country's difficulties and the people's suffering, resolutely retired to promote the early realization of peace. Zongren, in accordance with Article 49 of the Constitution, assumed the powers of the President and took office on January 22nd. At this time of serious situation, I hope that the military and political leaders of all regions will stay in their posts, work together with one heart and one mind, and work hard together. Your outstanding insights are also hoped to be stated at any time for selection. Li Zongren, January 26th, official seal."

### The National Army Firmly Defends the South Bank of the Chuhe River, Communist Troops Invade Yizheng, Attempt to Test the Waters for Crossing the River and Landing, Unsuccessful, Commander Li Yannian Sits in Puzhen

[Our Yongzhen Dispatch, 26th] As of 11 pm on the 26th, the National Army in the southern section of the Jinpu Railway is still firmly defending the south bank of the Chuhe River. There are still National Army vanguard troops in the east and west of Geqie on the north bank. Army Corps Commander Li Yannian is still sitting in Puzhen. The rumor that the Communist troops have already entered Puzhen is absolutely incorrect.

[Our Puzhen Dispatch, 26th] Since the National Army completed meticulous deployments on the south bank of the Chuhe River and formed the strongest bridgehead on the north bank of the Yangtze River, thereby protecting the gateway to the capital, the people's hearts in the area of Nanjing's Xiaguan and the two Pus have become more stable. On the 26th, the Communist Jianghuai Independent Brigade in the Wuyi area continued to harass the forward positions of the National Army in Xige, north of the Chuhe River, but they were all repelled by Yang Gancai's entire army.

[Our Puzhen Dispatch, 26th] More than 2,000 Communist troops invaded Yizheng on the afternoon of the 25th. That night, they tried to use small groups of about 50 to 60 people to use civilian ships to attempt a probing landing on the Yangtze River near Gaozi via Lisi Island in the southeast of the city. After being discovered by the National Army on the south bank, they were all driven away. Currently, the key point of Dahekou in the southwest of Yizheng is still being defended by a certain battalion of the National Army.

[Our Changshu Dispatch, 26th] After the deployment of large armies to defend the river here, the coastal defense is impenetrable. The highway in the Shierxu Port area has been hastily repaired overnight. Ships under 30 tons in ports such as Fushan and Hupu have been successively evacuated to designated locations, while the rest remain moored in their original locations awaiting orders.

[United Press, Nanjing, 26th] There has been very little military activity along the Yangtze River here today. The ferries between Nanjing and Pukou are busy, and passengers are crowded as usual. A batch of infantry is lined up along the river, waiting to go north. It is said that the Communist troops have surrounded Puzhen, but have not cut off Yangtze River shipping. The Hankou ship that arrived in Nanjing today also had no accidents along the way. Although the situation in the capital is still tense, the order is still good.

[United Press, Nanjing, 26th] A senior government official told the United Press reporter today that if the peace talks fail, the government will abandon the Yangtze River basin and defend the new defense line in the south to continue the war. If the price of peace demanded by the Communist Party is too high, Nanjing and Shanghai will probably surrender without a fight. The new defense line has been prepared and runs southwest along the Qiantang River from the seaport near Hangzhou to Nanchang, and then northwest from Nanchang to Wuchang. In the past few days, a large number of National Army troops have been ordered to transfer south, and the Ministry of National Defense will also withdraw completely by the 28th, leaving only the garrison command to continue to stay in Nanjing. In order to prevent the failure of the peace talks, the National Army's final new strategy will divide the country into three major groups: the Southeast Group under the command of Li Zongren, the Southwest Group under the management of Bai Chongxi, and the Northwest Group, including the troops of Ma Hongkui and Ma Bufang, all under the command of Hu Zongnan. As for Taiwan, it will be incorporated into the Southeast Group. However, military observers here generally believe that it will be difficult for the government to defend the new defense line for several months with the existing troops, because the government lost most of the well-equipped National Army in the Battle of Xuzhou. At present, apart from a small number of troops from Bai Chongxi and Guangzhou, most of them are new recruits with no combat experience.

Six Bends to Inspect the Front Line

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 26th] The reporter inspected the front line of Liubian with Sun Qifeng, director of the ferry office, on a special boat on the morning of the 26th and saw the garrison troops having lunch with excellent morale. At about 7 am in the morning, a skirmish occurred between the two sides at the forefront of Shijiaqiao, but it stopped after one or two shots were fired. Only three to five Communist plainclothes teams remained stationed there. Currently, the coastal areas along the Yangtze River in Liubian, Guazhou, and Shierxu are under lockdown. The garrison has built many strong bridgeheads and is waiting in full battle array. Due to military transport needs, ferries between Zhenjiang and Xu are still running irregularly. There are often four ferries and six tugboats parked in Liubian, with fires lit and ready to depart for military use. Refugees from Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Taixian, Taixing, Huaiyin, and Huai'an, north of the Yangtze River, are still coming south in succession, looking extremely haggard after a long journey. In addition, the naval gunboats Huian and Lianzhu patrol the river day and night, and at night, they constantly illuminate the north bank of the river with searchlights. At 3 pm, two air force planes flew low along the Yangxu Highway for a long time. It is expected here that the Communist troops have no intention of advancing south for the time being, and people's hearts are calm.

Traffic between Nanjing and Shanghai is Safe

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Since the National Army successively withdrew from Liuhe, Yizheng, Yangzhou, and other places north of the Yangtze River, all sectors of the outside world are quite concerned about the safety of traffic on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway in the future. The reporter specially visited a military observer for this purpose. According to reports, the reason why the National Army continues to withdraw from certain key points along the Yangtze River north of the Yangtze River is, on the one hand, to save troops and strengthen the defense forces on the south bank of the Yangtze River, and on the other hand, to show the government's sincerity and determination for peace talks. As for the abandonment of certain key points along the Yangtze River north of the Yangtze River, especially Yizheng, although the river surface there is narrow, if the Communist troops use heavy artillery to fire at the south of the Yangtze River, it may pose some threats to railway traffic and damage the transportation line. However, the impact is minimal. During the Anti-Japanese War, the area near Tongguan in the western section of the Longhai Railway was always within the effective range of Japanese artillery fire from Fenglingdu on the north bank of the Yellow River. Even with the accurate aiming of Japanese soldiers, we have not heard of any trains being bombed and destroyed.

### Commercial Telegrams between Tong and Ru Interrupted, Rumors that National Army Withdraws from Rugao

[Our Nantong Dispatch, 26th] Commercial telegram contact between here and Rugao has been interrupted. It is widely rumored that the National Army has withdrawn, but the military has not confirmed this. Communications to Jingjiang have also been cut off.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Jingjiang, across the river from Jiangyin, has been surrounded by more than 1,000 Communist troops since the night of the 24th. As of dusk on the 25th, although it is still being defended by the National Army, the situation is obviously extremely serious.

### Wuhu City Defense Headquarters Advises Citizens to Move to Safe Areas

[Our Wuhu Dispatch, 26th] The Wuhu City Defense Headquarters, facing the imminent war in Wuhu, advises citizens to move to safe areas to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. Martial law continues to be enforced and will only be lifted after the Communist military actions cease.

### Zhang Xueliang Prepares to Leave the Mountain, But the Release Order Has Not Yet Arrived in Taiwan, Yang Sen Reports Yang Hucheng's Release to the Pacification Headquarters for Handling

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 26th] The central government's order to release Zhang Xueliang has not yet arrived. Mo Dehui has also not yet arrived here. However, Zhang has learned of this news and is preparing to leave the mountain. It is expected that he will first come to Taipei within this week. In the past two years, Zhang has lived in Inoue Onsen in Hsinchu County. Except that he cannot leave the mountain, everything else is extremely free, and his life is comfortable and his health is very good. [Central News Agency, This City News] Mo Dehui said: He will go to Taiwan in two or three days to visit Mr. Zhang Xueliang and exchange opinions on the current situation.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 26th] Fellow villagers from Northeast China sent Zhang Xueliang a telegram of condolence.

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 26th] Yang Sen received a telegram today ordering the release of Yang Hucheng, which he immediately reported to the Pacification Headquarters for handling. As of 4 pm, reporters were still unable to meet with Yang Hucheng.

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 26th] Yu Youren spoke with Yang Sen on the long-distance phone today, inquiring about Yang Hucheng's situation. According to Air Force Commander Yan Yucong, he told reporters at 5 pm that he had not yet received a telegram from the headquarters assigning a plane to carry Yang Hucheng to Beijing. In addition, Li Huan, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, brought a telegram from Beijing to the Pacification Headquarters today and discussed it with Secretary-General Liao Kaitao for a long time.

### Abolish National Special Criminal Courts, Political Prisoners Released on Bail, Passed by Executive Yuan at Its Forty-First Meeting

Resolutions: (1) Abolish the National Special Criminal Courts and hand over the study of how to abolish the Special Criminal Regulations to the Ministries of Interior and Justice Administration and the Secretariat; (2) All political prisoners held in various Special Criminal Courts who have not yet been tried shall be released on bail in full; (3) Newspapers and magazines that have been permanently suspended for violating the Publication Law or the General Mobilization Law shall be allowed to resume publication (including Nanjing Xinmin Daily, Changsha Shijian Evening News, Shanghai Rebirth Ten-Day Journal, Observation Weekly, Beiping Zhongjian Bi-Monthly Journal, Nanjing Truth News, etc.); (4) Order all agencies and people not to arrest people without legal basis. 2. Appointments and removals: The President proposed that Guan Lirun, member of the Xikang Provincial Government and Director of the Department of Education, should be dismissed, and Zhang Tanru was appointed as a member of the Xikang Provincial Government and Director of the Department of Education, and the resolution was passed.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The Executive Yuan decided today to release political prisoners. The reporter specially asked the Executive Yuan whether those arrested for violating martial law would also be allowed to be released on bail. The person in charge replied: Releasing political prisoners and martial law are two different matters. Violating martial law cannot be called a political prisoner (none of the matters stipulated in martial law are political in nature). In martial law areas, the responsible authorities should still handle matters in accordance with martial law in order to maintain law and order.

### Agencies Moving to Guangzhou to Open on Fifth of Next Month

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The government has decided to move to Guangzhou and has set the date for the opening of central agencies in Guangzhou on the 5th of next month.

[United Press, Nanjing, 26th] Authoritative sources say the government of Acting President Li will move to Guangzhou within 10 days. Acting President Li and his cabinet will remain in Nanjing to direct peace efforts. Most government officials have already withdrawn from Nanjing. Personnel of the Executive Yuan will begin withdrawing to Guangzhou on the 26th. The Ministries of Finance and Food are empty. The Legislative and Supervisory Yuan are preparing to leave before the end of the month. The road to Xiaguan Railway Station is full of trucks carrying people.

[United Press, Nanjing, 26th] A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy said a practical plan had been drawn up to move embassy staff and equipment south as soon as possible. A full withdrawal from Beijing is unlikely in the short term. Other embassies are expected to take similar action. The attitude of the Soviet Embassy is currently unknown. Earlier, French Ambassador Meyrier, leader of the diplomatic corps, had notified the embassies of various countries that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would provide cars to Guangzhou. When asked about this, a spokesman for the Ministry replied that he knew nothing about it.

### Editorial: Starting with the Development of Backward Areas of the World

President Truman of the United States is currently drafting a "bold new plan" for the development of backward areas of the world, which will lend 10 billion US dollars to backward countries of the world and complement his own resource development plan. The content of this new plan is currently unknown; however, according to a Washington dispatch from the United Press on the 22nd, US officials stated that this new plan requires the cooperation of four parties: the US government, international banks, US private capital, and recipient countries. Its nature is completely different from the Marshall Plan for foreign aid. The US dollars lent to various countries must be returned in the future. At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Bevin was the first to express his enthusiastic support for President Truman's new plan to develop backward areas of the world. He said: "We welcome President Truman's assurance that the United States will use all its resources and technology to defend Western civilization." He also said: "The answer to communism lies in achieving a good standard of living, enjoying happiness, and cooperating with the Western world."

Although President Truman's true intentions for this new plan are not yet fully understood, it can be asserted that President Truman will abandon the "Marshall Plan" and adopt a purely economic new plan. Based on this, the "Cold War" engaged in by the United States and the Soviet Union may be expected to gradually ease in the future; although there is no sign to be believed at present, and the fact is exactly the opposite, the Soviet Union, in order to concentrate the resources and strength of its Eastern European satellite countries, has formulated a Soviet-style "Marshall Plan" for the six countries within the Eastern European Iron Curtain, and will establish an "East European Economic and Mutual Assistance Committee" in order to compete with the European Recovery Program launched by the United States. But in our opinion, it is much better for two different economic systems to engage in economic competition as much as possible than a "Cold War", at least there is no smell of gunpowder.

Recently, there are two major international events that deserve our special attention. One is the signing of the British-Polish trade agreement in Warsaw on the 14th of this month, which stipulates that the total trade between the two countries will reach as much as 260 million pounds, with a period of up to five years; Poland supplies eggs, corned meat, and wood to the United Kingdom, while the United Kingdom imports wool, rubber, petroleum, and industrial equipment to Poland. It is obvious that the relationship between the United Kingdom and Poland will improve as a result. This agreement not only promotes trade between the two countries, but also reverses the economic relations between the two countries. It is heard that the United Kingdom has unfrozen 500 million pounds of the Polish government's deposits in the United Kingdom, and the Polish government has also recognized all its debts to the United Kingdom before the war. This matter is even more sufficient to illustrate the indivisibility of Europe. Despite the fact that Poland is within the red iron curtain, despite the intensification of the "Cold War", it still cannot prevent trade between the United Kingdom and Poland. The second is that South Korea's foreign trade is gradually increasing its exports to the United States, while its business relations with Eastern European countries are gradually becoming estranged. Since South Korean Prime Minister Tito decided to trade with the West in December last year, South Korea has exported non-ferrous metals such as copper, lead, antimony, and mercury to the United States, with a total value of 3,676,000 US dollars, which will inevitably increase in the future. However, the amount of the South Korean-Soviet Union 1949 trade agreement is only one-eighth of last year's total trade; at the same time, South Korea's trade with Poland is also gradually decreasing. Therefore, the Soviet Union has not included South Korea in the East European Economic and Mutual Assistance Committee. This fact is even more sufficient to illustrate that the development of human economic relations is natural and cannot be prevented by any political force.

Fair and mutually beneficial economic assistance will be universally welcomed by countries around the world, regardless of the position taken. Therefore, we can assume that if President Truman's new plan for the development of backward areas is entirely a fair and mutually beneficial economic assistance, without any other effects and intentions, it will surely promote universal prosperity in the world, so that the majority of people can enjoy material happiness, and in the United States itself, there is no danger of an economic panic. Foreign Secretary Bevin said, "A good standard of living is the best answer to communism." Even if the United States still insists on opposing communism and still wants to prevent the outward development of communist forces, this is also the road to peace and prosperity. We hope that President Truman's peaceful efforts can move towards this road of peace and prosperity.

### No Progress in the Situation in the Old Capital, Small Squads of Communist Troops Appear on the Streets for the First Time, Suiyuan Announced Ceasefire Starting Yesterday

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 26th] (1) Fu Zuoyi has decided to send Guo Zhongzheng, Zhou Beifeng, and Qin Fengchuan to participate in the joint office organization. (2) Liu Zhonghua, representative of Acting President Li, intends to make informal contact with Communist Party personnel through the mediation of Fu Zuoyi and Deng Binshan, and is currently in contact. (3) The two sides have only agreed to a temporary truce on the Suiyuan issue. The Communist Party hopes to follow the Beiping method, while Fu advocates leaving it to be resolved in conjunction with comprehensive peace, so there is no concrete decision yet.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 26th] There is no progress in the situation in Beiping. There are still trivial matters when the National Army leaves the city, which need to be further resolved. The Communist Army has not yet entered the city today, and the joint organization has not been established. However, the National Army representatives of the organization have been determined to be Guo Zongfen, Zhou Beifeng, and Qin Fengchuan.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 26th] The war in Suiyuan has come to an end. Both sides announced a ceasefire starting on the 26th, and other military and political handover issues are being negotiated.

[Special Dispatch from the United Press in Beiping, 26th] Small squads of Communist troops appeared publicly on the main streets of the city for the first time today. People and government soldiers along the way paid close attention to them. They traveled to stores to shop and paid with people's currency.

[Special Dispatch from the United Press in Beiping, 26th] It is predicted here on the 26th that there will be a large-scale military deployment, which is obviously a signal for the step of completely occupying Beiping. Three hundred fully armed soldiers, led by the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth, passed by the reporter's residence along the main street in the city. None of the 300 people had the Blue Sky and White Sun emblem on their hats. According to this, this is the only distinction between the National and Communist armies. The reporter greeted the soldiers and asked where they were going. They only smiled and did not answer. The audience and the reporter on both sides thought they were Communist troops, but a senior official denied on the phone that the Communist troops had entered the city. Chinese newspapers said that Ye Jianying will serve as the mayor and chairman of the Beiping Military Commission, Lin Biao has been appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Pingjin District, and Nie Rongzhen is the garrison commander of Pingjin. Ye Jianying will be the protagonist of the Beiping Joint Municipal Government.

The delay in the establishment of the joint regime is said to be due to the National Army's failure to withdraw from the city at the specified time. In fact, all heavy weapons, ammunition, and other supplies are said to have been concentrated for transfer, and the soldiers seen in the streets only carry light weapons. Preparations for ending the strongholds of the National Army in North China are in full swing. It is said that Yan Xishan has invited a representative stationed in Beiping to invite a third party to be Lu Zhonglian. In fact, it has been constantly heard for months that Yan has contacted the CCP to negotiate peace. Fu Zuoyi's representative flying from Beiping to Suiyuan is said to have completed the peaceful measures for Guisui, Baotou, Datong, and other isolated strongholds. The current president of the Shanxi Law Academy in Beiping sent a telegram to Yan on the 25th, denouncing him for being reactionary and acting like a tyrant. The content of the telegram was published by all newspapers in Beiping. Beiping newspapers are becoming increasingly left-leaning in order to win the favor of the CCP, so they published the full text of the CCP radio station's attack on the Nanjing political situation in large print. Ji Chairman Chu Xichun confirmed that Li Jishen can come to Beiping in one or two days. There is also news coverage of the new political consultative conference in Shijiazhuang.

### Hangzhou Local Maintenance Association Established on the 31st

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Hangzhou, 26th] Local people in Hangzhou, initiated by the Municipal Council, have contacted all walks of life and are actively preparing to form the Hangzhou Local Maintenance Association, which will be formally established on the 31st.

### After the Beiping Armistice, Gold, Banknotes, and Silver Dollars are Actively Traded, Prices Rise and Fall Rapidly

[Special Dispatch from the United Press in Beiping, 26th] Although the Communist currency has been circulating freely outside the city of Beiping, it has not yet appeared in the city. Since the armistice on the 22nd of this month, US dollars, gold bars, and silver dollars have been actively traded in the city, and prices have fluctuated greatly. The trading of gold bars and silver dollars is more active than that of US dollars. The price fluctuations of US dollars, silver dollars, and gold in recent days are listed below (unit: Gold Yuan Certificates):

US Dollars (per dollar)

Highest Price Lowest Price

22nd 350 250

23rd 240 170

24th 250 200

25th 315 270

Silver Dollars (per dollar)

Highest Price Lowest Price

22nd 400 350

23rd 300 200

24th 400 260

25th 360 340

Gold (per tael)

Highest Price Lowest Price

22nd 25500 22500

23rd 14500 12000

24th 17500 14500

25th 24500 21000

The exchange rate between gold and US dollars was 65 US dollars per tael on the 22nd and 23rd, a maximum of 72 yuan and a minimum of 70 yuan on the 24th, and a maximum of 75 yuan and a minimum of 68 yuan on the 25th.

The price of Gold Yuan Certificates against gold and silver rises and falls rapidly due to rumors and speculation about the future exchange rate of Communist currency against Gold Yuan Certificates. There are many types of Communist currency, with different values. According to travelers to Beiping, the Communist Party stipulates that 8 Gold Yuan Certificates can be exchanged for 1 People's Banknote, and 80 People's Banknotes can be exchanged for 1 silver dollar. If so, then 1 silver dollar is worth 640 Gold Yuan Certificates. This exchange rate is probably also temporary.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 26th] Prices in Beiping have risen sharply in recent days. Today, a bag of flour costs 1600 yuan, a catty of pork costs 380 yuan, gold costs 24500 yuan, and silver dollars cost 520 yuan.

### Wuxi and Chengdu Commodity Prices Weak, Lanzhou Floating Funds Flood the Market

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chengdu, 26th] The money market in Sichuan was tight during the Lunar New Year. With the opening of peace talks, commodity prices generally fell. Gold, silver, cloth, yarn, tobacco, department stores, rice, and oil have been declining for days. The market is watching and waiting, and the situation is like a grindstone. However, daily-use industries such as food, hairdressing, and entertainment have raised prices sharply following the customs, and people's livelihood is still difficult.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Lanzhou, 26th] The Lunar New Year is approaching, and floating funds in Lanzhou are flooding the market, and commodity prices are fluctuating greatly. The Central Bank chartered a plane to transport more than 200 million yuan in cash yesterday, with the lowest denomination of 20 yuan, to expedite the payment of double salaries for military, government, and education personnel in January. In addition, 100-yuan banknotes were released, and the price of silver coins quickly approached the 250 yuan mark within a few hours.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Hankou, 26th] Rumors are rife here, and black market gold and silver and daily-use commodities are still rising sharply. Silver dollars have already hit the 300 yuan mark, and the prices of commodities such as firewood, rice, oil, and cloth have all doubled compared to yesterday. In addition, the Central Bank of Hankou has transported 800 taels of gold from Shanghai, and the deposit and exchange applications issued a month ago have now begun to be honored.

### Guangzhou Flower Market Prices are Remarkably Expensive, a Pot of Peonies Costs 800 Yuan

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Guangzhou, 26th] The annual flower market for the abolished Lunar New Year in Guangzhou has emerged in due course, but the prices are remarkably expensive. A pot of peonies costs 800 Gold Yuan. In this time of economic depression, it is expected that this year's flower market will be bleak.

### Nantong Peace Promotion Association Suggests Designating an Undefended Zone

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nantong, 26th] The Nantong Peace Promotion Association continued to be held today. Considering that the cultural and industrial construction of Nantong Tangzha is the crystallization of the hard work of private predecessors, it is requested that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party designate it as an undefended zone before the realization of comprehensive peace. When the National Army withdraws, the police and self-defense teams will be reorganized into people's self-defense groups to maintain order. Concrete opinions will be formulated and delivered to both parties in writing. Guo Yinsheng, Jiang Wenxiang, Luo Yuheng, Chen Zhongzhi and other four representatives were immediately elected to contact both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Jiangyin, 26th] The County Council representatives responded to the six propositions of the Wuxi community on behalf of the people, and telegraphed the councils of various provinces, cities, and counties, turning hostility into friendship, saving the people from fire and water, and realizing democratic peace.

[Special Dispatch from Central News Agency in This City] According to China Airlines: A special plane of the company flew from Shanghai to Beiping at 8:45 a.m. on the 26th to transport goods, and landed at the Tiantan Airport in Beiping at noon.

### US Aid Materials Stored in Pingjin, Economic Cooperation Administration Still Plans to Allot and Sell, A Batch of Medicines Arrives in Beiping from Shanghai

[Special Dispatch from the United Press in Washington, 25th] Economic Cooperation Administration China Commander Cleveland announced today that the General Administration is settling the amount of US aid materials existing in Beiping and Tianjin, and will compare the cargo accounts with the latest report from the China Branch. The recent report from the China Branch stated that there are US aid wheat, flour, and gauze worth about 4 million yuan in Pingjin, which seems too high. The General Administration still intends to continue rationing to the Chinese people, at least until the materials in China are used up. However, future measures involve political aspects, and the State Department will decide. Continuing rationing is in accordance with established policy. The use of US aid materials in the CCP-controlled area will be subject to the strictest restrictions, and it must be stated that such materials come from the United States, and the branch must send personnel to inspect their use. Since the Communist Army occupied Beiping, the General Administration has not received a report from the resident representative Davis in Ping, probably due to the chaos when the area fell. The representative in Tianjin, Avery, reports by telegram almost every day.

[Special Dispatch from the United Press in Beiping, 26th] The China Branch of the Economic Cooperation Administration chartered a special China Airlines plane full of medicines today, which arrived here from Shanghai via Qingdao, and will be handed over to Chinese doctors for distribution to various hospitals.

### US Consul General in Shanghai, Cabot, Delivers Speech; Refutes Communist Anti-American Arguments

[United States Information Service, Shanghai, 26th] The US Consul General in Shanghai, Cabot, delivered a speech at the American University Club, the full text of which is as follows:

Recently, newspapers have often published statements by a certain Chinese political leader. Have you all read the one he made on January 14th? Now, let me share some excerpts with you:

"Since July 1946, the reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government, with the help of American imperialists, has violated the will of the people, torn up the truce agreement, and launched a nationwide counter-revolutionary civil war, now for two and a half years. In these two and a half years of war, the Nanjing Kuomintang government has violated the will of the people, sold out national interests to the United States, colluded with the American navy and air force to occupy China's territorial waters and airspace, signed a large number of traitorous treaties, and enticed the American military advisory group to participate in the civil war, obtaining aircraft, artillery, rifles, ammunition, and all kinds of military supplies from the United States to massacre the people."

At this point, that political leader stopped attacking American imperialism, perhaps because he was out of breath, although he later specifically pointed out that the abolition of traitorous treaties was one of the conditions for peace talks.

In view of all that the US government has done in China in the past two and a half years, this statement is indeed a very severe accusation, and it is only part of what Radio Yan'an has been saying. Patriotic Chinese individuals and well-meaning American citizens here should certainly want to know whether the US government has actually committed such heinous acts. This is a university gathering, and precisely because academic freedom is a belief that universities should uphold, you all should want to know the truth. Now, let us look at the historical record:

Where is the People's Will? How do We Know It?

The distinguished leader I am referring to seems to be short on facts and long on reckless criticism. As for the former, we may be able to add a little something.

In the short excerpt I quoted, the statement mentions the "will of the people" twice, which must be referring to the will of the Chinese people, but I highly doubt how they know what they mean. In the United States, we can easily know what the will of the people is - and I am not referring to opinion polls. For example, we know that the American people wanted to elect Truman as president.

We know that it was Truman, not Wallace, who received the support of labor. It is generally believed that Wall Street bankers were opposed to Truman's election, and these bankers are the ones Radio Yan'an likes to denounce the most. Therefore, we can be quite certain that when Mr. Truman's government sponsored aid to the Chinese Nationalist government, this was the will of the American people, not what Wall Street bankers wanted. But as for the distinguished political leader I quoted, does he have the same means to ascertain the will of the Chinese people? Have the Communists held free elections in their controlled areas? Has any Communist regime ever held free elections? Or ruled in any country through free elections? The Czechs, Hungarians, and a dozen other nations may be willing to testify to this. Before they accuse the United States of violating the will of the Chinese people, let the Communists obtain a mandate from the Chinese people through free elections.

American Carefully Respects Chinese Nationalism

The statement also mentions that China's national sovereignty has been completely sold out to the US government. In the absence of more specific charges, this charge is a bit like the old joke, "Have you stopped beating your wife?" (Translator's note: There is a popular joke in the United States: A lawyer asks the defendant, "Have you stopped beating your wife?" This question is very cleverly phrased, because whether the defendant's answer is "I have stopped" or "I have not stopped," he has already admitted to having beaten his wife. In short, Cabot believes that the Communist accusations are too empty and impossible to answer.) But perhaps this is just an introduction to various crimes later. Nevertheless, let me say that the United States carefully respects China's sovereignty. The United States does not want to ask the Chinese government or any other government to sell out national rights. We do not want to obtain any privileged position in China for Chinese people or any other people.

The next item is a bit more specific: saying that the Nationalist government "borrowed billions of US dollars in foreign debt from the US government." But strangely enough, the United States has not lent a single dollar to the Chinese government since July 1946; on the contrary, we have refused to continue the proposed $500 million loan from the Export-Import Bank. Even Communist propaganda says that our aid to China since the Victory over Japan has only been $400 million, which itself is a very inflated figure, and most of it does not need to be repaid. I will talk about our aid agreement shortly.

Who is Infringing on Sovereignty? Look at Dalian and Lushun

The next item in the list is: "It has prompted the US government's navy and air force to occupy Chinese territory and territorial waters and infringe on China's airspace sovereignty." Have the Communists forgotten that these troops came to China to help China liberate its territory from the Japanese army? Do they (the Communists) think that these troops will remain in China longer than the recognized Chinese authorities want them to stay? Moreover, we would like to hear what position the Communists take on the fact that a foreign country occupies Dalian? Also, do they also acknowledge the current status of Lushun? Although we agree with the Communist Party's claim about the evils of imperialism, we feel that they should pay attention to the situations mentioned above. In fact, foreign troops in that area seem to be stationed on Chinese soil forever. (Continued on page 4)

### US Armed Services Committee Holds Secret Meeting; To Formulate New US Military Policy; Relations with the Soviet Union Will Be a Major Issue; Senate Foreign Relations Committee Passes Appointment of Webb as Undersecretary of State

[United Press Washington, 25th] Secretary of Defense Forrestal will present a secret review of the world military situation to the House Armed Services Committee on the 6th, and analyze the administration's defense requests for the 1950 fiscal year. Armed Services Committee Chairman Vinson said that the meeting would be kept highly confidential, but would address the "general state of national defense." Vinson also warned his colleagues in advance that Forrestal and the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force's reports "will be kept under the highest security and must not be leaked." However, US-Soviet relations will undoubtedly be its theme.

[Central News Agency Washington, 25th] The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee today unanimously passed Truman's appointment of former Budget Director Webb to succeed Lovett as Undersecretary of State. It is expected that the Senate will also pass this motion before the 27th. At the same time, the House Foreign Affairs Committee has not yet been formed due to waiting for the appointment of Republican members. At the same time, the House Armed Services Committee has decided to formulate US military policy with strong measures, so it will hold a secret meeting.

[United Press Washington, 25th] The US Munitions Board revealed on the 25th that the US stockpile of strategic military materials has increased sharply in recent months and is now almost ready. Board Director Cabant said that the stockpiled materials are currently valued at $1.446 billion. Some of them are post-war surplus stockpiles, and some are newly purchased after the war. The plan began in July 1946 to stockpile materials worth $3.693 billion. According to the current progress rate, this can be achieved around New Year's Day in 1953.

### US Policy Toward China Remains Unchanged; Will Maintain Bipartisan US Foreign Policy; Acheson Announces at First Press Conference

[Our Newspaper News] Washington, 26th Radio: US Secretary of State Acheson held his first reception for journalists. It is said that if the United States wants to maintain peace, it is best to clearly state in advance that anyone who threatens the security of our country with armed force will encounter overwhelming resistance. He supports the plan for the United States, Canada, and five Western European countries to sign the North Atlantic Collective Defense Treaty.

Acheson first assured that he would strive to maintain the bipartisan foreign policy of the United States and that all plans would be discussed and carried out with Republican leaders. Secondly, he said that the US policy toward China and Latin America will continue unchanged, and he particularly emphasized that there is no change in the current policy toward China. As for the US attitude toward the Communist regime there, he was unwilling to speculate. Third, Acheson strongly stated that the US policy toward Germany will not sacrifice other Western European countries. Fourth, he said that the Soviet Union's recent announcement of a plan to implement economic cooperation with six Eastern European satellite states is a natural response to the US aid plan to Europe and is not surprising. When a reporter asked what policy the United States would adopt toward China, Acheson replied: Truman, Marshall, and Lovett have repeatedly stated in recent weeks that the US policy toward China remains unchanged, and I can only reiterate this meaning at this moment. When a reporter asked other questions, Acheson said: If a Communist government is established in Nanjing, whether the United States will recognize it is something I cannot speculate on at this time. He also refused to answer whether the US embassy would continue to stay in Nanjing or move south to Guangzhou. Regarding the President's "bold new plan," Acheson said that the purpose of the plan is not to equip the entire world with modern facilities, but the US government is determined to do its best to assist culturally backward areas. As for specific plans for implementation, it is still too early at this time.

### MacArthur Turns Sixty-Nine; Still Works as Usual

### The Philippines Plans to Convene a Southeast Asian Conference

[Central News Agency Manila, 25th] Official sources recently stated that the Philippines may convene a regional conference here after the New Delhi Conference to discuss common interests. It is reported that this conference will be strictly limited to Southeast Asian countries because the fifteen-nation organization of the New Delhi Conference is too large and has conflicting interests.

[Central News Agency Manila, 25th United Press] A spokesman for the Philippine Foreign Ministry said that the Philippine Envoy to China, Xie Boxiang, will return to his post in Nanjing at the end of January. Xie will first go to Shanghai and then to Nanjing. Xie visited President Quirino with the Philippine Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Neri, before leaving yesterday.

### Egypt and Israel Have Signed a New Armistice Agreement

Panch Tells the Security Council

[United Press Success Lake, 25th] UN Mediator Panch notified this UN headquarters on the 25th that a new armistice agreement has been signed between Israel and Egypt, so that the previous armistice "can be completed and extended unchanged." Panch telegraphed Security Council Chairman MacNaughton (Canadian representative) that the negotiators on Rhodes Island have formally agreed that neither side will advance beyond the current front lines. This new armistice agreement stipulates renewed guarantees that neither Egypt nor Israel will take any new military action, even if peace talks fail.

[Agence France-Presse Tel Aviv, 26th] Although the Israeli representatives Hiron and Shatiel at the Rhodes Island truce talks sent a detailed report to Prime Minister Gurion and Foreign Minister Shertok today, saying that the talks have reached a stalemate, it is expected that the two representatives will return to Rhodes Island with new instructions at the end of the week.

### Deputy Director of Economic Cooperation Administration, Bruce, to Remain in Original Position

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 25th] The White House announced today that Bruce, Deputy Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration, will continue to serve in his position. It is reported that Bruce announced last week that he intended to resign and engage in business, while President Truman's secretary, Ross, declared that he would try to urge Bruce to remain in his original position.

### US Western States Hit by Cold Wave

Snow Seals Pastures, Livestock Starve and Freeze

[United Press Chicago, 25th] The western United States has been hit by a cold wave for several days. Roads are covered with ice and snow. Pastures from western California to Dakota are sealed by snow. More than 100 million head of livestock and millions of sheep are starving and freezing. The US Air Force is dispatching large numbers of aircraft to airlift fodder and drop it for aid. The Air Force today also joined the Army in using road-opening vehicles, trucks, and infantry battalions to open snow-covered roads, on a scale rarely seen in history. In Washington, the Senate Relief Subcommittee has allocated $750,000 to promote rescue work, and the South Dakota State Assembly has also allocated $100,000 for relief expenses. The cold wave has not subsided today. In some parts of Wyoming and Montana, the temperature has dropped to more than forty degrees below zero Fahrenheit.

### Britain and the United States Have Formed a United Front to Prevent Soviet Expansion in the Middle East; Bevin Publicly Acknowledges in the British House of Commons

[Our Newspaper News] London, 26th Radio: During a debate on foreign policy in the British House of Commons today, Foreign Secretary Bevin hinted that Britain and the United States have formed a united front to deal with the expansion of Soviet power in the Middle East. Bevin said that Britain and the United States have been able to cooperate frankly on security and economic policies in the Middle East. It is reported that Britain and the United States have recently been striving for consistency in their Middle East policies. This is the first time that British officials have stated that this effort has been successful. Bevin also expressed his willingness to accept President Truman's proposal to assist in the development of backward countries.

[Our Newspaper News] London, 26th Radio: Bevin announced that Britain has agreed to recognize the State of Israel de facto but will not be able to formally announce until after consulting with the Commonwealth. Bevin also said that the United States wants to recognize Transjordan. Bevin stressed that British recognition of Israel must come at the cost of Arab-Jewish peace.

### Egypt, India, and the Philippines Criticize the Four-Nation Proposal; Too Lenient Toward the Netherlands; Demand that the Security Council Take More Severe Action

[United Press Success Lake, 25th] The United Nations Security Council postponed action again on handling the Dutch-Indonesian dispute on the 25th, as countries from the Asian Conference launched a proposal to strengthen the US and other resolution proposals. Egypt, India, and the Philippines criticized the four-nation proposal for being too lenient toward the Netherlands and demanded that the Security Council take more severe action in accordance with the guidelines of the 19-nation Asian Conference resolution.

United Nations observers expect that the resolute action of the countries of the Asian Conference will strengthen the proposals of the four countries, China, the United States, Norway, and Cuba. Egyptian representative Fauzi Bey accused the Security Council of being "too lenient" toward the Netherlands. It is rumored that Egypt may propose a stronger amendment when the Security Council reconvenes to debate the Indonesian issue on the 27th. But no matter how Egypt criticizes the current draft, no matter what fate any amendment encounters, it is generally believed that Egypt may eventually support the four-nation proposal to ensure the necessary majority of seven votes for passage. Ukraine's Tarasenko severely criticized the entire proposal and denounced it as a "surrender proposal." The US delegation still firmly believes that the case can be passed when it is finally put to a vote - or on the 27th. Ukraine is expected to vote against it, and France, the Soviet Union, and Argentina are expected to abstain. The proposal can be passed with just seven votes.

### Fifteen Hundred Jewish Refugees from Cyprus Arrive in Haifa

[Agence France-Presse Haifa, 26th] The first batch of 1,500 Jewish refugees from Cyprus arrived here today aboard the transport ship Fatrah. All merchant ships in the port at that time, including British ships, expressed their welcome. Israeli military police lined up at the pier and played military music, and thousands of people standing on the pier sang the national anthem together to express their joy. The Israeli authorities have now made preparations to transport all 11,000 Jewish refugees still remaining on Cyprus back within two weeks.

### The Recent Three Major Events in China, Japan, and India Will Affect Western Policy and Cause the World to Face Two Major Forces

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 25th] The three major events that have occurred in Asia, namely, the termination of peace negotiations in China, the general election in Japan, and the Asian Conference in New Delhi, have focused the world's attention on East Asia and are sufficient to clarify the position that the people of the Western Hemisphere should take, so that they can choose between the two major forces of nationalism and communism that they face. In China, after the military failure of the Kuomintang, the situation has become increasingly uncontrollable. Its peace demands have in fact been rejected by the victorious Communist Party. The Communist Party is clearly only willing to negotiate with opponents of the Kuomintang's period of political monopoly or those who had separated before the failure of the National Government. The ongoing union between the Communist Party and the "Democratic League" is increasingly obvious and will establish a regime in China similar to the "people's democracy" governments in Eastern Europe. This kind of political machine is controlled by the Communist Party in both concept and fact. This prospect will constitute a long-term problem and equally complex practical problem in the future relationship between China and Western countries. The so-called long-term problem is whether the People's Democratic Government of China will be as absolutely loyal to Moscow behind the scenes as Outer Mongolia or Romania, or tend towards nationalism like Yugoslavia. The current problem involves the consequences that this new Chinese revolution will have in international conferences. China ranks fifth among the "strong countries" in these conferences, especially in the Security Council and the Allied Control Council in Tokyo. Qualified observers here believe that this issue is particularly acute in the Allied Control Council, where a Communist-controlled China, if it constantly takes actions supporting the Soviet viewpoint, could greatly undermine General MacArthur's plans. The results of the Japanese election have two factors that may further increase the rift between the two countries that defeated Japan, namely the United States and the Soviet Union. One is the disastrous defeat of the centrist parties and the victory of the extreme right-wing conservative parties. The extreme right-wing parties undoubtedly believe that the United States is the best guarantee against Soviet power. The second is the success of the Communist Party. The victory of the Communist Party in China has contributed to this outcome. The new government formed as a result of this election will further make Japan a fortress in the Far East resisting the Communist Party and Soviet forces because the United States will apparently leave China and Korea to their fate. Another resistance center with a different foundation (representing the nationalistic "third force," in which no Communist Party participates) seems to be forming, centered on India. Since gaining independence, India has clearly been eager to take a moderate position and become the center of a group of Asian powers. The New Delhi Conference initiated by India, which is known for taking a moderate position, aims to provide moral support to the non-Communist nationalism of Indonesia. The Viet Minh of the Communist Party of Vietnam and the Soviet republics of Central Asia were not invited. The participating countries emphasized that their resolutions should comply with the principles of the United Nations Charter and avoid making their discussions have the image of "opposition to Western countries' conspiracies." Therefore, the division between Asian nationalism and communism is becoming increasingly clear. Communism has attempted to use this nationalism to benefit itself. Well-informed sources here believe that the recognition of the above facts can increasingly affect the policies adopted by Western countries in Asia.

### Royall to Depart for Japan Tomorrow; Visits President Truman Before Leaving; Will Meet with MacArthur First After Arriving in Japan

[United Press Washington, 25th] Secretary of the Army Royall accompanied Chief of Staff General Bradley to visit President Truman on the 25th to discuss matters. Afterwards, Royall told reporters that he and the President discussed his inspection trip to Japan. He said that this trip to Japan will be short-term, similar to the recent trip to Germany. He said that he will discuss military government and economic matters with General MacArthur.

When asked what he thought of the Japanese general election, he replied that he knew MacArthur was very satisfied. Overall, he believed that the results of the general election were very favorable because the government would have the support of a majority party. Royall said that he will depart on the 28th, passing through Alaska, and from Alaska to Tokyo, Okinawa, Guam, and Hawaii, and return to Washington on February 15th. He said that the meeting with MacArthur will discuss "all matters of mutual interest." He declined to reveal more. When Secretary Royall walked out of the White House, he only made a brief comment. When asked whether there would be any new instructions for reporters stationed in Tokyo, he said he had no knowledge of it.

### Travelers to Japan Must Surrender Foreign Currency

Those Leaving Japan Are Not Allowed to Take Japanese Yen Out of the Country

[United Press Tokyo, 26th] MacArthur today ordered the Japanese government to amend the regulations on travelers carrying foreign currency in and out of Japan. The new order stipulates that travelers to Japan should surrender foreign currency. Those holding US dollars should exchange them for Japanese yen at a rate of one to 270, or deposit the foreign currency directly into a foreign bank. If foreign currency and US dollars are not exchanged or deposited, they will be kept in custody by the Bank of Japan and returned to travelers when they leave the country. Checks and remittances are not subject to this restriction unless they are brought in by Japanese citizens. Travelers leaving the country may bring all the foreign currency they brought when they arrived and US dollars approved by MacArthur's headquarters, but they may not take Japanese yen out of the country.

### Emperor of Japan's Silver Wedding Anniversary: No Extravagance in the Palace

[United Press Tokyo, 26th] Today marks the silver wedding anniversary of Emperor Hirohito and Empress Nagako. There is no extravagance in the Imperial Palace, and gifts are refused. Twenty-five years ago, Hirohito's marriage to Nagako was opposed by some ministers. One minister falsely claimed that Nagako was colorblind, which could affect their children, to thwart the aim of combating communism.

### Yoshida Plans to Form a Joint Cabinet of Conservative Factions

To thwart the aim of combating communism

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 26th] Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida issued his second denunciation of the Communist Party this afternoon after the general election, expressing his desire to "crush the Communist Party." Yoshida made a lengthy statement at a press conference, openly inviting the Democratic Party to cooperate with him. He stated that although the Democratic Liberal Party held a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, he still hoped to form a coalition government of conservative parties. Yoshida visited Democratic Party President Takeru Inukai this morning. He stated that he would meet with Inukai once in early next month to continue discussing the formation of a coalition government. Only after efforts to form a coalition government fail will he form a single-party cabinet. He expressed that under a coalition government system, there is hope to thoroughly crush the Communist Party.

### Fire at Nara Temple in Japan: Famous Murals Destroyed Simultaneously

[United Press Tokyo, 26th] A fire broke out this morning at a Nara temple in Japan, a national treasure with a history of 1,300 years. The roof of the main hall was pierced, and twelve famous Buddhist murals painted on the walls were destroyed. The temple was built in 587 AD and has been renovated over the centuries. It is the oldest existing wooden building in the world.

### Preliminary Results of Israeli General Election Revealed: Ben-Gurion Already Leading; Communist Party Unlikely to Exceed Five Seats in Parliament

[Agence France-Presse Tel Aviv, 26th] After the general election in Israel, although the votes cast by the army must be counted clearly by the 28th before the final results can be announced, the voting results this morning show that Mapai, led by Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, has achieved a great victory. It can be determined that Ben-Gurion has an advantage throughout Israel, and the opposition parties are unlikely to obtain many votes. Particularly disappointed are the Israeli communists, who fear that they will not be able to win more than four or five seats in the 120-member Israeli parliament. The right-wing Irgun party is also unlikely to achieve its predetermined goal. Yellin, an important candidate of the Stern Gang who is currently imprisoned awaiting judgment, is likely to be the only representative of the group to enter parliament.

### US Designates February 1st as National Freedom Day

[United States Information Service Washington, 25th] President Truman issued a proclamation today designating February 1st as National Freedom Day. The proclamation mentioned the goals of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations General Assembly last December. The day commemorates President Lincoln's signing in 1865 of a joint congressional proposal: recommending an amendment to the Constitution to place the then-permitted system of slavery in the United States outside the protection of the law. The passage of this amendment was the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

### Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, Yasuji Okamura, Declared Not Guilty; After Leaving the Court, Request to Meet with the Presiding Judge to Express Gratitude Was Rejected; Returned to Prison to Await Central Approval

[Reported by This Newspaper] The case of General Yasuji Okamura, former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, who was accused of being a war criminal, was retried by the Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense yesterday and declared not guilty. The main text of the judgment states: "Yasuji Okamura is not guilty." The reason given is: "According to the establishment of a war criminal, it is necessary to commit atrocities such as wanton slaughter, rape, and robbery during combat, or to violate international conventions by planning, conspiring, initiating, or supporting aggressive wars. It should not be assumed that anyone who participates in combat should be regarded as a war criminal. This is evident from the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 of international law and our country's War Criminal Trial Regulations. In this case, the defendant was ordered by the Japanese military leaders to serve as the Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Force on November 26, 1944. The atrocities committed by the Japanese army in the major battles of Changsha and Xuzhou, as well as the Nanjing Massacre by Takashi Sakai in Hong Kong and Guangdong, and Iwane Matsui and Hisao Tani in Nanjing, all occurred before the defendant's term of office and were not related to the defendant. (Takashi Sakai and Hisao Tani have been sentenced to death by this court and executed.) Moreover, at that time, the Allied forces had already landed in Normandy, Europe, and Saipan Island in the Pacific. The Axis powers had collapsed, and the Japanese army was isolated. Therefore, from the date the defendant took office until Japan's surrender, a period of eight months, most of the Japanese troops stationed in various parts of our country were demoralized and made little progress. When the Japanese government officially announced its surrender, the defendant ceased fighting, obeyed, and led a million troops to surrender. Based on his actions, he did not commit any of the above-mentioned crimes of slaughter, rape, robbery, or planning, conspiring, initiating, or supporting aggressive wars. Therefore, he cannot be judged as a war criminal merely because of his status as the commander-in-chief of the enemy army. Although sporadic atrocities occurred in the counties where the Japanese army was stationed during the defendant's term of office, such as Lanhua in Jiangxi, Shaoyang in Hunan, and Yongjia in Zhejiang, this responsibility should be borne by the perpetrators and the direct supervisors of each jurisdiction, such as Shinkuro Ochiai and Genjiro Hishida. Shinkuro Ochiai and others have been sentenced by this court and approved for execution. These occasional incidents scattered in various places cannot prove that the defendant had any connection with the intention to commit crimes, nor can they make him liable for the responsibility of a co-offender. In summary, the defendant did not violate war regulations or other acts that violate international law. According to the law, he should be declared not guilty in order to be fair."

After Yasuji Okamura left the court after hearing the verdict, he requested to meet with Presiding Judge Meiyu Shi to express his gratitude. Presiding Judge Shi did not grant the meeting but instructed the translator to convey: "If the evidence of the crime is conclusive, the death penalty should be imposed. Now that there is no evidence of the crime, a verdict of not guilty should be declared according to the law. Therefore, there is no need to express thanks."

Presiding Judge Shi then told reporters: "The trial of this case has absolutely no political implications. This court is purely based on the law to pronounce the verdict and is willing to bear all responsibilities. As for whether it is right or wrong, it is up to the public opinion of domestic and international人士 to judge."

According to reports, Yasuji Okamura underwent the first public trial on August 23 of last year. The Military Tribunal still needed to investigate evidence in Hankou, and Okamura suffered from lung disease, so the matter was delayed for a long time. The retrial was held at 10:00 AM yesterday, and the verdict was announced at 4:00 PM. In addition to Presiding Judge Meiyu Shi, the judges included Qi Lu, Jianpeng Lin, Zai Zeng Ye, and Tikun Zhang. The prosecutor did not present any new evidence during the retrial, and Okamura did not make any further defenses. Defense lawyers Yiping Jiang and Peng Yang were late, and Longsheng Qian briefly defended, arguing that (1) the Japanese army's atrocities in Hunan, Zhejiang, and other places should be the responsibility of the direct supervisors; and (2) Okamura was meritorious in handling the handover after the surrender. At 10:35 AM, the presiding judge concluded the arguments. After the verdict was announced at 4:00 PM, the military tribunal also issued printed materials including the main text of the judgment and the essentials of the judgment with reasons. Okamura's complexion was rosy, and he no longer appeared ill. After the verdict was announced, he was still detained in the war criminal prison. The case still needs to be submitted to the highest authorities in the central government for approval.

### Tadao Ito Given Life Sentence; Shiro Sakuraba Acquitted

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Military Tribunal yesterday separately announced two cases of criminals: (1) Tadao Ito, former Japanese Army Captain and Legal Officer, was sentenced to life imprisonment for jointly killing prisoners. Tadao Ito was a legal officer at the former Japanese Taiwan Army Headquarters Court. In the winter of 1944, twenty-four members of our Pudong Patriotic Salvation Army, including Shirong Li, took a sailboat to Ningbo for training. On the way, they encountered a storm and drifted to Daan Port in Taiwan, where they were discovered and captured by the enemy and sent to the Army Headquarters. Twenty of them were sentenced to death. Tadao Ito was one of the presiding judges. (2) Shiro Sakuraba, former Brigade Commander of the 82nd Brigade of the Japanese 20th Army, was declared not guilty. Shiro Sakuraba was accused of condoning his subordinates to massacre merchants and civilians in Zhuzhou, Hunan. An investigation found no evidence.

### All War Criminal Cases Have Been Tried; Military Tribunal to End at the End of February

[Reported by This Newspaper] All war criminal cases of the Military Tribunal have now been tried, and the court has decided to end at the end of February. According to published statistics, a total of more than 2,200 war criminal cases were accepted. 145 people were sentenced to death, more than 400 were sentenced to fixed-term or life imprisonment, and the rest were acquitted and repatriated. The sentenced criminals are still detained in the Jiangwan War Criminal Prison. If the situation deteriorates, they may be transferred to Taiwan for execution.

### Many Civil Servants from the Capital Arrive in Batches in Shanghai Awaiting Ships to Go South

Many batches of civil servants and their families from Nanjing have arrived in Shanghai by train awaiting ships to go south. According to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, as of now, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Finance, and other important ministries and commissions have contacted the company requesting urgent ships. Their destinations are Fuzhou and Guangzhou. However, they are individually requesting the company to allocate ships, and there is no unified organization responsible for handling the evacuation, making it difficult for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to allocate ships. The company hopes that the Executive Yuan will send personnel to Shanghai to assist in the unified transportation work.

### US Consul General in Shanghai, Walter McConaughy, Delivers a Speech: Refuting the CCP's Anti-American Rhetoric

(Continued from page 2) Briefly clarifying the accusation that US aircraft invaded China's airspace and sovereignty. No aircraft of the US government flew in China without the express consent of the legitimate authorities. Our planes fly over British territory and foreign planes fly over US territory in the same manner, and no one has ever felt that these planes are violating the sovereignty of Britain or the United States. We have neither requested nor obtained any special aviation rights anywhere in China. But we would like to know how the CCP views another strong country's agreement with China, according to which even the Chinese government cannot agree to the US Embassy's aircraft flying to Dihua.

What "Traitorous Conditions" Are You Referring To?

The detailed list also mentions "the many traitorous treaties signed by the National Government and the US government" and demands their abolition. The two most recent treaties we have signed with China were signed in 1943 and 1946. In the first treaty, we gave up our extraterritorial rights and the concession rights of the treaty ports.

If the Chinese Communist Party considers this a traitorous treaty and seeks to abolish it, then I want to make it clear to them that we are determined to refuse to reclaim our extraterritorial rights and port concessions—we are delighted that this infringement of Chinese sovereignty has ended.

Our other recent treaty, the Treaty of Commerce signed in 1946 and which only came into effect on November 30 last year, has replaced all existing unequal treaties. The purpose of this treaty is to replace them with one treaty. This treaty should recognize that China should be able to demand equal treatment when signing agreements with foreign countries. This is the first equal commercial treaty that the Chinese government has ever negotiated. I can't say whether this outstanding leader considers this treaty an unequal treaty - he didn't specify exactly which treaties he opposes and which articles in those treaties he considers exceptions. But if this does indeed refer to this treaty, then he is completely in agreement with my friend Gold, who believes that it is unfair. You should remember that Gold opposed this treaty with all his might on the entire back page of the "China Press." Perhaps I should ask the House Un-American Activities Committee to investigate the strange connection between these two warriors. However, in the United States, we can hear both sides of the opposition, so we can generally feel that we have reached a fairly fair middle ground.

Surplus Materials Agreement Used to Pay Off Debts

During the post-war period, we also signed several agreements with China regarding the implementation of affairs. One of them is the Surplus Materials Agreement of 1946. According to this agreement, we agreed to transfer surplus materials with a value of approximately 500 million US dollars (it should be specifically pointed out that guns, ammunition, military aircraft, and other combat supplies are clearly stipulated as not included), as well as some other things, to China. As for the above-mentioned other things, they are mainly used to offset the debts owed by our military personnel in China. We did not ask China to pay for the expenses of our military personnel in China, but we did ask our other allies to pay for the expenses of our military personnel stationed on their territories as part of the compensation for our lend-lease assistance. Is the Chinese Communist Party complaining about this? This is indeed the most obvious example of an unequal nature in any recent agreement we have signed with China. Under the Surplus Materials Agreement, the Chinese government agreed to set aside 20,000,000,000 yuan in Chinese currency to ensure that it would not become a burden on the Chinese economy—to establish an educational fund. Perhaps this is a shocking example of American cultural aggression, because this money must be used entirely in China. But even the Chinese Communist Party cannot criticize the many sums of money that our churches have spent on education in China for many years with noble intentions and caring love. But in the communist concept, the idea of trade is a forbidden thing, which is quite sad.

I don't think this statement might refer to the 1946 air transport agreement as a traitorous treaty, which is completely reciprocal in writing. Each party is allowed to operate three international routes. In fact, this agreement has greatly improved China's international transportation.

Perhaps the Communist Party is referring to our aid agreement as a traitorous treaty. This is where the Communist Party's propaganda truly tries to denounce American imperialism—it says that our aid plan is completely a trap, the purpose of which is: (1) to enslave Chinese workers, and (2) to dispose of our surplus goods so that the tottering structure of our capitalist economy can be maintained for some time. Unfortunately, the Chinese Communist Party has not elaborated on these ideas. Generally, they have discovered that in a place without freedom of speech, they do not need to prove their arguments. In any case, they have not explained why we should not help the Chinese government. It should be known that this government is recognized by all other governments as the sole legitimate authority in China, including the Soviet Union.

Signing Agreements with the Aim of Benefiting the Chinese People

The facts regarding our aid plan are very simple. We have signed agreements, hoping to ensure that the aid can truly benefit the Chinese people. The few American die-hards who have insisted that American aid should be attached to political conditions will undoubtedly weep with shame and admit that they have wronged the State Department after hearing the following rumors, which are (if we believe the communist propaganda) that we have obtained important political privileges from the National Government without the public's knowledge. I must also correct this idea. We have never thought about political issues when providing various forms of aid. After the aid to China plan ends, the Chinese government does not have any permanent obligations to the United States. Since there is a traditional friendship between China and the United States, we do not insist on more rewards other than hoping that the aid can be used effectively. The purpose of our aid to China agreement is to help Chinese laborers. These agreements provide food to workers and their families, fuel and cotton to factories so that they can continue to operate, and clothing to workers. Today, there are materials worth millions of dollars in Shanghai. The United States is donating these materials to the Chinese people without thinking about material compensation. As long as this aid is beneficial to the Chinese people, the American people will be satisfied. The American people will never take the opportunity of China's disasters to seize selfish interests in China. Perhaps in this regard, the Chinese Communist Party will answer a question. Does the CCP welcome American aid or the aid of another country? The former is transporting materials worth millions of dollars into China without any cost, while the latter is taking everything that can be moved in the Northeast, and the quantity is not too small. This aid has cost China billions in machinery and other materials.

The communist propaganda materials ridiculed the Economic Cooperation Administration Director Paul Hoffman's remarks regarding American aid to communist areas. I have seen these propaganda materials, in which they ridiculed Hoffman's statement that if the ECA officials can supervise American aid and freely publish news about American aid, then American aid can continue a little. My last job was in a certain communist country in Southeast Europe, where the UN aid was used by the communist regime to reward those loyal to the communist party and punish those who did not believe in the communist party. Government propaganda praised the government's achievements in obtaining aid, but at the same time, it condemned the United States and the United Kingdom, which were the source of 90% of the aid, day and night. Is it because of this that the CCP believes that accepting Hoffman's conditions is detrimental to China's sovereignty?

Our aid plan also includes a rural construction agreement. I don't know if the communist party will consider this to be another imperialist plan to hinder the growth of Chinese crops and sell American agricultural machinery to Chinese farmers. But I do know that this is not what we mean. What we want to do is to help Chinese farmers make the most of their very limited fields. If the communist party considers this agreement to be of a traitorous nature, then let them elaborate on it as much as they like.

Transporting Large Quantities of Products to China Without Requiring Material Benefits

In short, it would be helpful if the communist propaganda could explain what material benefits we hope to gain by giving China a large amount of our products. No country has become rich in this way. It would be equally helpful if the communist propaganda could explain how we can give food, fuel, and raw materials to Chinese workers and at the same time promote our imperialist attempts. It should be known that Chinese workers use these raw materials to work, and we do not attach any permanent restrictions to the aid we provide. Furthermore, we can ask how these treaties can be abolished. The 1943 treaty does not include any provisions for abolition for obvious reasons. The 1946 treaty cannot be abolished within five years. We cannot imagine the Chinese Communist Party wanting to become a recognized treaty breaker like Hitler. Treaties can only be abolished in accordance with their own provisions or with the consent of the other party.

China's Land Privileges Were Lost in the Sino-Soviet Agreement

Since we are talking about unequal treaties, then it would be helpful if we could hear what the Chinese Communist Party intends to do with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945. Indeed, this is an unequal treaty and an example—as far as I know, this is the only important condition of an unequal nature that China is still involved in—because it gives privileges on Chinese land to a foreign country. When the American people hear the Chinese Communist Party denouncing traitorous treaties, the American people will generally believe in the sincerity of their denunciation if they demand the abolition of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945. The strange fact is that the United States seems to be more criticized in China for suggesting this treaty than the country that imposed this 19th-century traditional imperialist treaty on China. As for why the United States previously proposed this treaty, it was because it feared that something worse would happen. (Continued on page 5)

### Curfew Passes to Be Changed Starting February 1st

A spokesperson for the Songhu Garrison Command told reporters yesterday that the curfew passes for the martial law period in the Songhu garrison area will be changed to new passes starting February 1st. The new passes are divided into three types: (1) passes held by personnel, light yellow for general purposes, and dark yellow for special purposes; (2) vehicle passes, blue for general purposes, and red for special purposes; and (3) ship passes, all of which are white. The methods for using and obtaining passes will be officially announced by the command soon.

### Severance Pay for Huainan Railway Employees Resolved

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, more than 400 employees of the Huainan Railway Corporation, who had withdrawn from Huainan to Shanghai, went to the corporation's office on the second floor of the Jiangxi Road Construction Building to demand severance pay. At that time, the labor side demanded a minimum of five bolts of Dragon Head fine cloth and 2,000 gold yuan in cash per person, which was far from the conditions promised by the company. As a result, the situation was tense. The general manager of the company, Wenxun Cheng, telegraphed Director Yu of the police局 to send Section Chief Ling of the Huangpu Branch to mediate. The matter was satisfactorily resolved at 8:00 PM, with each employee receiving three bolts of Dragon Head fine cloth and 4,000 gold yuan.

### Shipping Association Organizes Distribution Agency, Plans to Operate Routes to Northern China, Decides to Send Representatives to Beiping to Negotiate with the Communist Side

[Our Report] Due to the cessation of shipping to Northern China caused by the war, foreign shipping companies are seizing the opportunity to exploit the situation and plan to resume coastal trade with us. On January 21, a foreign ship of about 2,000 tons loaded cargo from Shidao to Hong Kong, and it is reported that two more ships will follow. The National Shipping Industry Association, in order to safeguard navigation rights and relieve the people's livelihood, has conducted multiple detailed discussions on restoring shipping to Northern China. They believe that foreign shipping companies should absolutely not be allowed to engage in our coastal trade, which would harm the interests of our entire nation. It was decided to plan and organize a unified distribution agency, designating ships to operate routes to Northern China. The association recently sent representatives to meet with Sun, the head of the Executive Yuan, to explain their views. Premier Sun expressed agreement in principle and approved the association to send representatives to negotiate with the Communist Party on the issue of navigation. The Shipping Association then requested Shao Lizi and Zhang Zhizhong to convey the sincerity of the shipping industry to the Communist side. Shao and Zhang expressed their sympathy and agreed to support. Du Yuesheng, chairman of the Shipping Association, and Wei Wenhan, chairman of the Shanghai Association, telegraphed General Ye Jianying in Beiping yesterday, forwarding it to Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, stating the importance of safeguarding navigation rights and restoring shipping to Northern China, which is crucial to national interests and the people's economic well-being, and said that they planned to send representatives to Beiping immediately to discuss navigation methods. The association also convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday to discuss the candidates for representatives and navigation plans. It was decided that the representatives of the shipping industry to Beiping would be Wei Wenhan, chairman of the Shanghai Association, Zhang Qingnan, manager of the Tianjin branch of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and one representative from the seamen's organization, for a total of three representatives. At the same time, Shen Qi, secretary-general of the Shanghai Association of the Shipping Association, will accompany them to handle various documents. Currently, once the plan is finalized, the representatives will fly to Beiping to negotiate. It is also reported that in order to prevent foreign ships from entering the Yangtze River, the Shipping Association will take the same measures as those used for opening navigation on the Northern China route if the situation changes.

### Passengers on Two Lines Anxious to Return Home, Train Order Increasingly Chaotic, Impossible to Improve for the Time Being

The train order on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines remains chaotic, and the number of passengers traveling back and forth has increased unabated. The luggage room is piled high with luggage. Luggage transported from Beijing to Shanghai could be claimed at the latest the next day, but now it takes more than three days to wait, and it is still impossible to claim it. The express train to Beijing departing from Shanghai yesterday morning did not depart until after 11:00 am. Most passengers who purchased reserved seats could not get the seats they were supposed to sit in. All vehicles were packed with passengers, and even the roof of the car was full of passengers. Although the railway bureau has repeatedly advised them not to take such risks, they are anxious to return home and pay no attention to it. According to people in charge of the railway bureau: It is really impossible to improve this kind of congestion in the short term.

### Reserved Seat Cars Canceled Starting at Midnight Tonight

[Another Report] Due to the chaotic train order, trains have been generally delayed for several days, ranging from four hours to more than ten hours. The biggest reason for the delay is the frequent military transportation, but another main reason is the expulsion of passengers without tickets occupying reserved seat cars. Therefore, the railway bureau has resolutely decided to cancel all reserved seat cars starting at midnight today.

In addition, because the number of people receiving porridge at the city's relief society's porridge kitchens has decreased during the Lunar New Year and the staff also want to rest, it has been decided to stop giving porridge for three days on the first, second, and third days of the New Year. If the staff of each porridge kitchen is willing to work as usual, the porridge distribution will still be maintained.

### Winter Vacation Passes Quickly, Donations Not Much, Please Save on Extravagance, To Help Impoverished Students

The "Reader Scholarship Fund" sponsored by this newspaper has been soliciting donations since January 18, and it has been ten days now, but the total amount of donations is only more than 19,000 yuan, which is a pitifully small amount compared to our expected goal. The short winter vacation will soon pass in the blink of an eye, and the general impoverished children are worrying about the huge tuition fees that will soon be due. As for what good times and festivals, they simply have no share in them.

Dear readers, can you bear to watch them struggling in the threat of dropping out of school and economic hardship without giving a helping hand? We hope that every father, every mother, and young readers who are children can save a little extravagance in the Lunar New Year to help the poor young people.

New Year's Eve dinner, lucky money, firecrackers, candy... everything is a source of "scholarship money". Thrift is originally a virtue, and it would be even better to donate the savings to others, which is a combination of two beauties.

The purpose of this assistance is to ensure that the Ministry of Social Affairs' debt to the Children's Fund can be repaid on time so that the association can continue to work in China according to the original plan.

### Gang of Thugs Gang Rape Woman, Four Criminals to be Sentenced Today

Except for Yao Qilin's confession of raping Lu once, the others denied the crime. After the debate ended, it was decided to pronounce the verdict this afternoon. The victim, Lu A Zhen, arrived in Shanghai by car from Wuxi on the evening of December 1 last year. When she arrived at Xujiahui, martial law had already been declared. Lu urgently went to the Huimin Inn on Guangyuan Road to stay, but it was already full. Lu then begged the tea house servant Cao Wenbin to find a way, which was seen by Yao and others. Yao and others thought that she was slightly attractive and was alone, so they tricked Lu into the inn and forcibly gang-raped her. Later, the police station received a report and arrested Yao and others together, transferred them to the District Procuratorate for detention in heavy shackles, and prohibited them from seeing their families. They were then prosecuted for rape.

### Rapidly Declining Year, Chaotic Situation, Neighborhoods Inquiring About Silver Dollar Prices, Stations Crowded with Evacuees

[Our Report] The rapidly declining year and the heavy situation have not yet seen the light. The mood of the citizens of this city to welcome the Lunar New Year as usual is significantly less enthusiastic than in the past. On this New Year's Eve, because both buyers and sellers in various markets are watching the development of the situation, there are no major transactions, so the price fluctuations, except for vegetables, fish, meat, etc., are not as severe as imagined. According to statistics from the industries that need the most New Year's goods and incense candles every year, sales this year are abnormally sluggish due to the significant decline in the purchasing power of citizens. Most middle-class families do not have any special decorations. Only the frequent inquiries about the price of silver dollars can be heard between neighborhoods, and it seems that everyone wants to find a way to purchase and store them. Docks and stations are crowded with people evacuating from various places to here. Most of them seem to be coming to Shanghai for the first time, or need money to continue south, so many peddlers who guide and buy and sell travelers' clothes have appeared near the stations and docks. Most citizens seem to lack active interest in all entertainment, but they are more excited about all kinds of vividly depicted rumors. At night, because the martial law order still exists, the long streets are desolate. Only the long sound of gongs and drums occasionally comes from afar, reminding people that they are still spending the remaining years here.

### Using Lost Check, Department Store Defrauded

[Our Report] At around 4:00 pm on the 25th, a uniformed policeman No. 233 came to the Jiujiu Department Store at No. 227 Yunnan Road and selected one men's and one women's cotton sweater and a pair of black leather gloves, totaling 1,150 gold yuan. The policeman then paid a check from Qiankang Bank for 1,500 silver dollars, and the store gave him 350 yuan in change and took the goods away. However, at 10:00 am yesterday, the store sent employee Jiang Shunyuan to the bank to cash the check and discovered that the check had been lost by the account holder Qin Deyuan and had already been reported to Qiankang Bank as lost. Jiang Shunyuan was then detained by the bank and sent to the Lao Zha Police Station. After the police officer in charge asked Jiang about the details, he summoned the uniformed policeman and the security police team No. 233 to the station, but none of them were the policemen who bought the goods. The police fear that he is a dismissed policeman or an impersonator. It is hoped that all merchants will pay attention.

Also, at around 9:00 pm last night, the same thing happened on the roof of a resident's house near the Xieqiao Bridge on Lujiabang Road in Nanshi. At that time, the resident immediately shouted "robber". The man, feeling guilty, lost his footing and fell from the roof. An ambulance was called and sent to the police hospital. Due to the severity of his injuries, he was unconscious, so his name is still unknown.

### Strictly Prohibit Cleaners from Soliciting Petty Gratuities

[Our Report] The Municipal Health Bureau has stipulated that the salaries of cleaners and the monthly fees for night soil carriers in the city are fixed, and all personnel must not solicit in violation of the regulations. They have been ordered to comply. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, it is feared that there may still be a small number of cases of greed and solicitation, so a public notice is issued to strictly order all relevant workers in the city to strictly abide by this.

### Gauze Market Trading Light, Closed for Six Days Starting Today, Market Opens on February 2nd

Cotton yarn trend is stable, and there are very few transactions in the market. Most parties are handling the settlement procedures. The fluctuations of various yarns are narrow, and the results show a situation of mutual glory and disgrace.

42s Blue Phoenix opened at 74,500 yuan, then shouted up to 77,000 yuan midway, and finally loosened back to 74,000 yuan at the close, up 1,000 yuan from the previous day. 40s Blue Phoenix still stood firm at the previous day's original price of 70,500 yuan unchanged. 32s Silver Moon rose from 56,000 yuan to a maximum of 63,000 yuan, and closed at noon at 60,000 yuan, a slight increase of 1,000 yuan. 21s Double Horse spot opened at a low of 48,000 yuan, rose to 52,000 yuan at one point, and closed back to 50,000 yuan, a final increase of 1,500 yuan.

As a result, only three households were approved to purchase, and five pieces were approved to purchase, with a value of 503,000 yuan.

The cotton cloth market is tired and unable to rise. The atmosphere of selling was particularly strong yesterday morning. Many colleagues are settling accounts, and only Hankou helped slightly. The street shops also added some at low prices. There were more sellers than buyers in the market, and trading turned sluggish. The market was sluggish, and prices were fluctuating and falling.

Dragon Head fine cloth stepped down from 2,300 yuan to 2,250 yuan at the end. Five Fortune fine cloth was 2,000 yuan, and loose pieces were traded at 1,800 yuan. Trumpet Boy fine cloth opened at 1,930 yuan and closed at 1,820 yuan, down 160 yuan. In addition, B Dragon Head and Three Peach fine cloth also fell. Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge opened at 2,000 yuan at the beginning, and once rose to 2,040 yuan, but before closing, there were more floating orders than actual transactions, and the momentum was unsustainable, and finally closed at 1,890 yuan, squeezed down 200 yuan. Jinlian Miaowu and Leifeng Pagoda Yuan Serge both hovered in the soft range. The market is scheduled to be closed starting today and issued a notice saying: "This market will be closed for six days for the Spring Festival holiday from the 27th of this year and will resume trading as usual on February 2 (the fifth day of the first lunar month)."

### This Year's National Treasury Revenue and Expenditure Matters Will Temporarily Be Handled with Reference to Old Subject Categories

[Our Newspaper's Report] The National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank recently sent a circular to all its branches, stating that it had approved a letter from the National Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance, indicating that the 37th fiscal year of the National Treasury has ended, and the 38th fiscal year has begun. However, the central government's general budget for the 38th year has not yet been finalized into law. Therefore, the subject categories to be used for national treasury accounting this year cannot be compiled and sent. In order to avoid difficulties in handling matters after the start of the year, all revenue and expenditure matters of the National Treasury for the 38th year that have already occurred should still be handled with reference to the National Treasury Disbursement Accounting System and the subject categories for national treasury accounting for the second half of the 37th year. If there are any changes to the subject categories for the 38th year, they will be investigated and corrected separately.

### This Year's Taiwan Sugar Exports Will Be More Than Double Last Year's

According to Taiwan Sugar Corporation, the crushing operations of all its factories in Taiwan for the 37th to 38th year period have partially begun.

### Overseas Remittance Income of the Bank of China Increases

[Our Newspaper's Report] The amount of overseas remittances received by the Overseas Department of the Bank of China from various parts of Southeast Asia and the Americas has recently increased again. In the past, the daily receipt amount was about 30,000 US dollars. In the past two weeks, overseas remittance income has improved, and about 70,000 to 80,000 US dollars can be received daily. In recent days, it has increased to about 100,000 US dollars per day. It is reported that the important reasons for the recent increase in overseas remittance income are: (1) The Central Bank's overseas remittance rates are adjusted at any time according to the actual situation, so the difference from the black market rate is not far. (2) Remitting overseas remittances to various parts of the country through the black market is risky. If the exchange rate is not far from the black market, overseas Chinese mostly hope to remit to various places through the national bank.

### Woolen Fabrics: Nominal Profits, Actual Losses

Woolen fabric wholesalers, brokers in Qipan Street and Changle Teahouse, and market runners have decreased significantly. Most have returned to their hometowns for the New Year. Also, due to sluggish sales, both buyers and sellers are seeking to close their positions and wait quietly until the fifth or sixth day of the first lunar month to do business again. An investigation reveals that most woolen fabric businesses suffered nominal profits but actual losses after final settlement for the 37th year. According to the Gold Yuan conversions in the account books, there appear to be profits. However, when calculated based on the stockpiled goods, reduced quantity, and diminished weight, all are facing losses.

### Taiwan Province's Five Major Specialties See Increased Production

(3) Pineapples: Pineapple is the most famous specialty of Taiwan, with a history of processing and manufacturing for 40 years. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry recently has a five-year plan for canned pineapples, which can reach 2 million cases per year. The types are divided into foreign species and native species. The native species are further divided into red-skinned, yellow-skinned, and bird-skinned varieties. Because the fruits are smaller, they are not suitable for canning. The quality of foreign species is not inferior to that of Singapore and Hawaii and sells well in Europe. (4) Hats and Mats: They are a major side business on the island, with exquisite artistry and almost the exclusive profession of women in Taiwan Province. There are hundreds of thousands of these female workers, and they can produce more than 30 million pieces per year. (5) Tea: According to the planting area of tea trees in 1943, there were 40,793 hectares. After the war, the government actively reorganized to compete for the international market. Tea production is divided into more than 30 types. Black tea is fully fermented tea and has received many good reviews in the world tea market. Oolong tea is semi-fermented tea and has the strongest aroma. Pouchong tea is second. Currently, they are sold domestically in Fuzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, Tianjin, and other places, and in foreign markets such as the Nanyang Islands, the United Kingdom, Turkey, and Russia.

### Silk Prices Fall Again

The market situation of rayon yesterday continued to be weak. Most major dealers have stopped trading, and retail investors are still selling more. The market sentiment is weak, and the closing price of Nawi Lingxing was further squeezed.

After the No. 120 Tianqiao opened at 74,000 yuan, it was heard that the price of gold was stable, and the trend of other commodities outside the industry was hovering. People's hearts were indifferent to gains and losses, but because the end of the year was approaching, the surface was no longer supportive. Dealers wanted to sell, and the asking price was small. By the close of the market, it had fallen to 70,000 yuan, squeezing another 5,000 yuan. The afternoon market did not improve. The gold price rebounded strongly, but the price of goods was still low, and the trend continued to be sluggish. Tianqiao offered 67,000 yuan and 68,000 yuan for sale, which was shorter than the previous market.

The transaction of raw silk has come to an end, and there will be no good prospects this year. The market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates is still hovering between 170 yuan and 180 yuan, and people's hearts are mediocre. It was initially heard that the price of gold was stable. At the opening, superior zero-load offered 80,000 yuan for sale. Intermediate buyers cut prices, and the sellers could not hold on. The market situation continued to be weak, and it fell to 75,000 yuan near noon. In the afternoon, there was a supply of 72,000 yuan.

The market for silk fabrics is depressed, and the price trends of a range of goods are weak. The sentiment in the industry is mixed, and the market situation is first stable and then falling. Meiya quilt opened in the morning and offered 49,000 yuan, but there was no transaction for a while. Finally, the intention to sell gradually increased, and the market situation turned into a weak gear, once falling to 45,000 yuan. Near noon, because the money market was loose, the long orders were unwilling to lend at a low interest rate, and they turned to buying goods. The buying atmosphere in the market was slightly strong, and the decline stood firm. Finally, it closed at 46,500 yuan, and the closing price was squeezed again. The after-market offered 44,000 yuan, but there was no improvement.

### "Reader Relief Fund" Calls for Donations, 29th Application Begins Today

Our newspaper-sponsored "Reader Relief Fund," the 28th batch of aid grants for seven individuals, including Wang Huangshi, was completed yesterday. The 29th application begins today. The procedure involves preparing an application detailing the living conditions, certified by the local Bao chief or Jia chief with their official seals, and finding a guarantor from a shop, then mailing it via registered mail to the Social Service Department of the Shen Bao office on Hankou Road for review. Those verified as genuine by our staff will receive an appropriate amount of assistance, which, though small, expresses the sympathy of humanity.

Recently, prices have soared, and the amount of aid disbursed has also increased monthly, threatening the depletion of the original fund. However, the number of applicants continues to rise daily, and our staff regrets that this assistance cannot benefit all those in distress.

As the Lunar New Year is approaching, more expenses are typically incurred according to custom. We hope that enthusiastic readers will economize their expenditures and donate the savings as aid. This would not only benefit suffering compatriots but also delight our staff.

Lost Statement: Our reader, Zhu Junqing, lost his identity card, number 108752, from Lane 5, Jia 5, Bao 22, Luwan District. Due to financial difficulties, he is unable to publish an advertisement and hereby applies for its cancellation.

### Review of Two Major Policies in Taiwan

— Our Special Correspondent Wu Shouren

[Taipei Airmail dispatch from Our Paper on the 20th] Chairman Chen Cheng has been in office for more than ten days. He has broken the traditional habits of the officialdom. The personnel issue has been as still as water. He has only added three staff members: a secretary, an advisor, and a commissioner. This kind of… though its persistence cannot be guaranteed, judging from his conversations with news reporters regarding personnel matters, he said he would completely obey the people's will. If the people think someone is needed, he will surely allow them to stay in their position. If the people think someone is not needed, he will never tolerate or show favoritism! The implication is that any future changes will be purely based on ability and integrity. While the wording seems tolerant, it is actually very strict. Compared to the practices of general officials, who, regardless of talent or foolishness, drastically change things, these two approaches are not the same. The compatriots in Taiwan have limitless respect for this wise action of his, especially since they know he is incorruptible and thrifty, and his private ethics are beyond what ordinary people can achieve. The extent of the Taiwanese people’s support for Chen suggests that his achievements in Taiwan are truly limitless.

In the week after taking office, Chen had frequent contact with various sectors. In addition to the guests and news reporters visiting him, he also repeatedly hosted group receptions for heads of the party, government, and military, as well as provincial and municipal councilors, National Assembly representatives, legislative and supervisory committee members, and central committee members. In these gatherings, he repeatedly put forward the slogan "People First, Livelihood First" and said that he had just taken on this important responsibility, that he does not deeply understand Taiwan, that several problems had not been researched, and that he could not yet provide a concrete report on future reforms.

Price Index Has Increased Wildly Since Restoration Three Years Ago

Looking at the current situation in Taiwan, on the surface, it does not have the devastation of the endless wars in the mainland, nor the misery of the countless refugees. The fluctuation of prices is not as drastic as in the mainland either. Who would not consider this small island a utopia, a paradise on earth? However, the compatriots in Taiwan and the people who have lived in Taiwan for a long time do not have this view. The reporter does not need to give many examples. Just taking the aspect of life, in the three years since the restoration, the retail price index has increased by 1,114,718 times, and this does not include the multiples that have been implicitly compensated for by the adjustment of the Taiwan exchange rate. To put it simply, abandoning the scientific statistical method of the index, the current general prices, with the exception of rice, are more expensive than those in Shanghai and Beijing by 60% to 100% for all daily necessities. Clothing is especially expensive. It is conceivable that the lives of Taiwanese compatriots are becoming increasingly difficult. If it were not for the food policy and the Taiwan dollar policy working together, we believe that the superficial stability in Taiwan today would no longer exist. But can the food policy and the Taiwan dollar policy maintain this stability for the long term?

Palliative Expedients Are Not Enough to Talk About Fundamental Cures

In fact, palliative expedients should never be regarded as thorough fundamental solutions. The reporter will try to analyze the reasons below: The effectiveness of the food policy is nothing more than two points: First, it enables the government to control a large amount of material goods; second, it is precisely because of these material goods that it can play a role in suppressing the price of grain to a certain extent, preventing it from rising higher. This kind of policy is of course well-intentioned and perfect, without flaws. Everyone should recognize its benefits to people's livelihoods. However, we know that the issue of people's livelihoods is by no means a simple food issue. Therefore, the success of Taiwan's food policy has only obtained a part of the help in the issue of people's livelihoods, and it is not the entire solution. Looking back at the facts, although the current rice price in Taiwan exceeds 1,000 Taiwan dollars per catty, it is about one-third cheaper than in Shanghai. Regardless of the difference between Taiwan and Shanghai in terms of producing and non-producing areas, and without studying whether this price is reasonable, we can still see that no one is panicking because of rice, because the government's material goods are constantly carrying out household rations, and public and special rations. The people who are not farmers do not need to worry about this supply. But what about the situation of the farmers? The price of rice exceeding 1,000 Taiwan dollars per catty is already an unprecedented and appalling price. Compared with other daily necessities, such as cloth, even if the reporter does not list its difference, as long as we refer to what was said before, it is 60% to 100% more expensive than Shanghai. We can imagine how large the disparity will be when exchanging food lower than Shanghai's for other daily necessities that are more expensive than Shanghai's. The total number of farm households in Taiwan is 323,121, of which only 3,401 are so-called large households. The income of large households is at least 11,100 kilograms per harvest. Although there is the burden of field tax, public school grain, surtax collection, and collection of more than 40% of the surplus grain, they still have a net surplus of 9,418 kilograms for each of the two annual harvests, so their lives are of course without problems. However, large households only account for slightly more than 1% of the farm households in the province. The income of most non-large households, who work hard and sweat blood, is of course even more minimal. It can be imagined how difficult it is to cope with the various living expenses. As for the public education personnel and the vast poor, although there is no problem with food, the salaries are meager, which puts them in a difficult situation. Not only is it impossible to support their parents and raise their children, but even taking care of their wives and children is often beyond their ability. Therefore, we feel that although Taiwan's food policy should be consistently implemented, if we rely on the food policy to boast about the stability of people's livelihoods, it is a matter of quoting out of context.

Implement a Comprehensive Rationing of Essential Supplies by Promoting Supporting Policies

Furthermore, if the government wants the food policy to be unanimously supported by compatriots throughout the province, it seems that it must implement a parallel supporting policy. In other words, it is a comprehensive rationing of essential supplies for life. All necessary items within the standard of living should be rationed in terms of quantity and sold at universally flat prices. This is a great undertaking, and under Chairman Chen Cheng's slogan of "People First, Livelihood First," it is also a necessary task for the provincial government. We cannot deny that before the implementation of this great undertaking, there will certainly be many technical difficulties, such as household registration, funds, losses, and staff, all of which require a lot of preparation. However, the reporter believes that these difficulties should be overcome. First, Taiwan already has a very good foundation for household registration. As long as it is slightly reorganized, it can be made accurate, and people can be called upon to automatically correct past mistakes. Second, Taiwan banks have the right to issue funds. The banknotes needed for rationing cannot be considered an expansion of currency. Third, Taiwan has so many public enterprises, all of which are the result of 51 years of exploitation of compatriots in the province. In the past, due to waste in personnel, profits were minimal. In the future, management should be strengthened, and a portion of the profits should be used to offset rationing losses. Moreover, the province is rich in agricultural and mineral products, most of which are controlled by the government for unified transportation and sales at home and abroad. If managed properly, profits will be high, and a portion can also be used to offset losses. Fourth, the issue of staff is even easier. The Material Adjustment Committee in the province has a large organization and many personnel. In the past few months, it has only conducted several irregular quantitative rations, and other businesses have been criticized by the outside world, believing that it is competing with the people for profits. Although it is not necessary to say that it is so, if this agency really has value, it is most appropriate to have it handle the comprehensive rationing.

In Mr. Chen Cixiu's policy plan, there is also a sentence that the distribution of materials should be reasonable in the future. The so-called comprehensive rationing is just a more concrete way of saying it. Only after this concrete method is implemented can the province's food policy be thoroughly completed.

The Essence of Taiwan Dollar Policy Lies in Dynamic Adjustment

Secondly, to analyze the Taiwan dollar policy, the essence of the Taiwan dollar policy lies in dynamic adjustment. Its effectiveness is to reduce the magnitude of price fluctuations in Taiwan, but not to completely eliminate fluctuations. Strictly speaking, no matter how high the exchange rate of Taiwan dollars is adjusted, Taiwan prices are still far higher than those in the mainland. It can be seen that the price issue is a whole issue of supply and demand. Relying on raising the value of the currency is not a fundamental solution. Moreover, raising the value of Taiwan dollars also has its inevitable harms, which is that it has a serious impact on export businesses. There have been many examples in the past few months. When the Taiwan dollar resumed dynamic adjustment, the value of the gold yuan fell sharply from 1835 yuan to 1000 yuan, and then to 600 yuan. At that time, the province's export businesses almost faced the crisis of bankruptcy. This is the threat of the Taiwan exchange rate to the province's industry and commerce. Let's study how the Taiwan exchange rate affects the business of Taiwan banks. The reporter dares to judge that from the perspective of pure banking business, it is also harmful and useless. Everyone must still remember that not long after the Taiwan exchange rate resumed dynamic adjustment, Taiwan banks announced the method of suspending the exchange of remittances outside the province, and also limited the amount of legitimate commercial remittances to the lowest amount. Although this method is said to be implemented to prevent the influx of speculative funds from outside the province to stimulate Taiwan prices, according to economic theory, the construction and development of any place only welcomes foreign speculative funds to lead to the right track. Therefore, Taiwan is in urgent need of construction and development. If it is purely to prevent stimulating prices and suspend the exchange of remittances outside the province, is it not an act of abandoning the essentials and grasping the trivial, choking on food because of a fear of choking? Therefore, there must be unavoidable difficulties inside. The so-called unavoidable difficulties, to put it simply, are nothing more than the fear that there are too many gold yuan balances in hand. Every time the Taiwan exchange rate is adjusted, it will encounter a loss. The Taiwan exchange rate is constantly adjusted, and this kind of loss will continue to increase, eventually making Taiwan banks unable to bear it. At the same time, merchants' arbitrage will inevitably intensify, and the expansion of the Taiwan dollar is especially difficult to predict. Based on the above two established facts, we can understand that although the adjustment of the Taiwan dollar cannot completely erase the help to the people's livelihoods of the province, it is not a long-term plan that can be relied on.

The Success of the Taiwan Dollar Policy Requires Comprehensive Rationing First

So how can the Taiwan dollar policy be made to have all the benefits and no disadvantages? For the time being, focusing on the two phenomena mentioned above, the reporter believes that in terms of prices, it is also necessary to rely on the implementation of the comprehensive rationing of living items to complement each other. People's daily needs do not have to rely on merchants. Even if merchants arbitrarily seek excessive profits, no one will be subjected to this exploitation. As for luxury goods that are not needed for life, which have nothing to do with the living needs of the vast majority of people, a portion of the bourgeoisie bears high prices for luxurious enjoyment, which is within their capacity, and the government does not need to intervene. Secondly, after diluting the relationship between the Taiwan exchange rate and prices, there is no need for drastic adjustments. Taiwan banks can avoid losses, and exchange with provinces outside Taiwan can also be resumed, allowing speculative funds to come to Taiwan. The government wants a way to absorb them, leading them into legitimate investment paths. We believe that the construction and development of Taiwan will have the hope of achieving twice the results with half the effort.

From any perspective, under Chairman Chen Cheng's major premise of "People First, Livelihood First," the importance and necessity of implementing comprehensive rationing of living items really exceeds the measures of general economic construction. If people's livelihoods are not resolved, if we want to talk about economic construction, it is nothing more than looking for fish in trees. Even if comprehensive rationing of living items is implemented, it does not mean that the entire issue of people's livelihoods can be resolved, but at least the needs of each person's standard of living can be guaranteed. At the same time, the government will call on the people to work together for economic construction, mobilize to increase production, and improve the standard of living, which will surely make the entire province respond and be happy to serve.

### U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Cabot, Gives a Speech Refuting the Chinese Communist Party's Anti-American Arguments

When Have U.S. Military Officers Ever Assisted in Combat in China?

[Continued from Page 4] We seem to have strayed quite far from the statement we were discussing, so let's get back to it. The next statement is that the U.S. Military Advisory Group participated in China's civil war. It would be interesting to know what evidence this statement is based on. Has the Communist Party ever captured any U.S. military officers assisting National Army operations in Jinan, Jinzhou, Shenyang, Xuzhou, or Tianjin? The fact is that the Communist Party knows that the U.S. Military Advisory Group did not participate in the civil war. Their orders absolutely forbade participation in China's civil war. The U.S. does not need power in China, nor does it want responsibility without power. The Advisory Group was sent to China before the mediation broke down, with the aim of implementing a long-term plan that would make another aggressor think twice before repeating Japan's mistake. It came to China with the full agreement of the Communist Party, and its intention was that the Communist Party's troops should be included in its training program (this intention was thwarted by the renewed outbreak of the civil war). Of course, the Communist Party must know that if the National Army was commanded by the U.S. Military Advisory Group, then their (National Army's) military operations would not have been so bad.

All U.S. Equipment Was Definitely Not Used for the Civil War

Next, we will discuss the matter of the aircraft, tanks, and artillery that we supplied to the Chinese National Army. The fact here is that most of the U.S. equipment owned by the National Army was supplied before July 1946. This was brought in by the U.S. to help China crush Japanese aggression and prevent the recurrence of aggression, not to be used in the civil war. The CCP should not forget that just four years ago, the U.S., the Kuomintang, and the CCP all had a common goal of resisting the Axis powers. Just as we oppose communism, we must not forget the CCP's many heroic deeds in the war of resistance against Japan or their service to our common goal.

Since we had re-equipped a large number of National Army troops with U.S. military equipment before July 1946, we certainly could not refuse to sell bullets to the National Government, which was cooperating with us, for these military equipment. When the opposing party is more obsequious in following a foreign party line, we also do not want to refuse the government to buy bullets. We declared our opposition to any foreign imperialist control of China in 1900, and we have always followed this same policy since then. We believe that this is not only in our own interest but also in China's interest, and we continue to think so. At that time, we were not supplying these weapons to slaughter the Chinese people. These weapons were for defending their freedom, resisting Japan or other foreigners who wanted to control China, and maintaining their own independence. We do not want China to sink under foreign tyranny against the will of the people, like many other ancient countries in Europe.

The entire statement I quoted implies that the Kuomintang is the U.S.'s follower, and that the Kuomintang authorities are our puppets and running dogs. If anyone thinks so, I urge them to read General Stilwell's works, which explain the extent to which our military officers were ignored in the China Theater. They can also look at the Kuomintang's official propaganda in Shanghai, which criticizes the U.S. far more than the Soviet Union.

Is the CCP Blindly Following Moscow's Orders?

In this regard, I have a question to ask the Communist Party.

In June 1948, the Communist Party Information Bureau issued a communiqué condemning Tito and other leaders of the Yugoslav government. You might say that Yugoslavia is far away, so what does it have to do with China? In that communiqué, the Information Bureau explained that Tito's crime was in refusing to blindly obey the orders of the Moscow Politburo, in insisting that he had the right to interpret Marx and Lenin, in insisting on safeguarding the interests of Yugoslavia, and in uniting with non-Communist elements to form a national liberation front to govern Yugoslavia. For these reasons, he was called a Trotskyist traitor.

The CCP has openly and unreservedly agreed with this communiqué.

My question is, is the CCP blindly following Moscow's orders? If we infer from their approval of this communiqué and many other pieces of evidence that they are obeying Moscow's orders, then the Communist Party cannot think that we are wrong. The U.S. does not believe that the Chinese people are willing to be ruled by foreign orders. Based on traditional friendship, the U.S. has provided assistance to prevent this from happening. If we have not provided more assistance, it is mainly because we suspect whether the assistance can be used effectively, rather than because we lack the enthusiasm for assistance. We do not want to tell the Chinese government how to handle its affairs, thereby infringing on China's sovereignty. Those who accuse U.S. imperialism of controlling China may as well explain whether they themselves also accept instructions from another foreign country.

### The Xia Shu Murder-for-Money Case Has Not Been Tried for Half a Month

[Dispatch from Jurong, This Newspaper, 24th] The Local Court of this county was officially announced to be established by the Jiangsu High Court on November 23 of last year. Song Yufeng was appointed as the acting president of the court, and Mr. Song did not arrive in the county to assume his new role until December 24. However, the Chief Prosecutor's position has remained vacant, with no announcement from the Jiangsu High Court, resulting in the freezing of all civil and criminal cases, with no trial date in sight. In particular, the murder-for-money case in Xia Shu has been delayed for half a month, with no one sent to the scene for investigation. In Zhu Jiabian Village, Seventh Bao, Xia Shu Town, there lived the wife of Zhu Liantang. On the night of the 8th of this month, she was suddenly attacked by a murderer for money and died. Town Mayor Wang Xiaoxuan, along with the military judge of the military force, went to the scene and verified that the deceased's brains were splattered, confirming that she had been killed by a murderer before death. The next (9th) day, the deceased's son discovered a woman leaving the village with a package. After investigation, it was found to be the deceased's belongings. When questioned, she confessed that the murderers were Song Yizhi and three others. They were arrested at their respective addresses, and multiple pieces of murder weapons and stolen goods were seized and handed over to the county for handling. However, the Local Court has not been fully established, so the trial has not yet begun.
