### Acting President Li Returns to the Capital; Yan Huiqing and Others Reschedule Flight to Peiping

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Acting President, along with the Second Bureau Chief of the Presidential Office, Huang Xuecun, and his party, returned to Nanjing by train from Shanghai on the 10th. Huang Shaozi, Gan Jiehou, Cheng Siyuan, and others are scheduled to return to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 11th.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Minister of National Defense Xu Yongchang went to Chuanhougang on the morning of the 10th to meet with Acting President Li and made a report.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong, who had previously gone to Shanghai on official business, returned to Nanjing by plane on the afternoon of the 10th.

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Peace Delegation, led by Yan Huiqing and others, was originally scheduled to fly to Peiping at 10:00 AM on the 11th for preliminary contact with the Communist side. As of midnight yesterday, although no long-distance telephone notification of a postponement had been received from Peiping, the delegation decided to postpone the departure to the 13th due to weather conditions. Yesterday, the representatives were all busy with private affairs and did not hold a meeting. Furthermore, there were rumors that the Communists had sent a note to Acting President Li, requesting a local peace in the Beijing-Shanghai area. When the reporter inquired about this with Mr. Gan, he said: "It is completely untrue. The Communists have neither submitted a note nor requested a local peace. In the position of Acting President, only overall peace can be discussed, not local peace can be considered."

[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] According to sources close to Acting President Li, Li has not diminished his determination to seek peace with the Communist army after returning to Beijing from Shanghai. However, the Communist side is unwilling to designate a formal negotiation location and time, which inevitably dims Li's hopes of completing the task of ending the civil war. It is heard that Li and his associates are studying the statements made by key figures in the Guangzhou government word by word. Li is also strongly requesting the Executive Yuan, or at least a portion of its members, to come to Beijing around the 15th to hold a meeting to study the current situation and decide what steps should be taken to ensure that the two factions in Beijing and Guangdong are aligned on future policies.

[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 10th] Xi Chulin, the Hunan representative attending the Hankou Peace Promotion Association, returned to Changsha on the 10th.

### Australian Foreign Minister Suggests UN Mediation of Our Internal Conflict; Good Reaction in Beijing Political Circles; Government Official Believes It's Not Too Late

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] According to a cable from Canberra: Australian Foreign Minister Evatt has suggested that the United Nations mediate the Chinese civil war. When the news arrived, the reaction in political circles here was extremely positive. According to a government official who spoke to a reporter: "After the government repeatedly declared its sincerity in seeking peace with the Communists, but was repeatedly rejected by the Communists, the end of the Chinese civil war must be achieved through international mediation. The Australian Foreign Minister's suggestion will undoubtedly be valued and accepted by representatives of various countries attending the United Nations. China has experienced years of war, and the people's livelihood is exhausted, awaiting recuperation, but the civil war broke out not long ago, and the people are suffering unspeakable pain. The United Nations, which was created to resist violence, should not sit idly by and ignore the serious difficulties faced by the Chinese people, who once shared life and death with them. Now, before the Communist side has fully declared its determination to fight to the end, international mediation is not too late. We sincerely hope that the United Nations will seize the opportunity, quickly accept this suggestion, and take effective steps."

[Agence France-Presse, Canberra, 9th] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt suggested on the 9th, when Parliament began debating foreign affairs, that the United Nations mediate the Chinese civil war. Evatt said: "As far as China is concerned, a long and tragic war has shaken the whole country and prevented the long-suffering people from enjoying the post-war recovery and reconstruction to which they are entitled. Therefore, I believe that we should assist in mediation to achieve a unanimous solution to save countless lives. This is fully in line with the principles of the United Nations. Due to the increasing differences between major countries and the severity of these differences, the United Nations is now particularly needed to take on the task of mediation and reconciliation." Evatt also praised the United Nations for achieving "continuous success." He also stated: "Australia's foreign policy is to continue to support the United Nations and Britain, to maintain the greatest possible cooperation with all countries in the United Nations, to establish regional agreements to promote welfare and prevent disputes that could cause international conflicts, to undertake reconciliation and mediation tasks whenever and wherever necessary, and to provide practical support for the United Nations' economic and humanitarian activities." Evatt also emphasized close cooperation with the United States, stating: "An important part of Australia's foreign policy is to maintain the greatest possible degree of cooperation with the United States, especially in the Pacific and Southeast Asia. The cooperation between Australia and the United States during the war was very close, and this cooperation has been further strengthened today by President Truman and his constructive Marshall Plan." The audience was very crowded when debating foreign policy today. There were many diplomatic representatives from various countries in the gallery, including envoys from China, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands. This debate will last for a week, and opposition leader Menzies is scheduled to respond early next week.

### Location of Legislative Yuan Reopening Undecided

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The constitutional term of the Legislative Yuan has arrived, but due to the government's move south, it has not yet been able to reopen. The location of the reopening is also subject to different opinions due to the dispersal of legislators in various regions. Legislators remaining in Guangzhou advocate holding meetings in Guangzhou, while legislators remaining in Beijing and Shanghai advocate reopening in Beijing. Currently, most of the staff of the Legislative Yuan have arrived in Guangzhou, which has some impact on the decision of the meeting location of the Legislative Yuan. Acting President Li hopes that the Legislative Yuan can convene in Beijing, as a gesture of support for the overall situation. However, when holding meetings in Beijing, traffic safety and other issues must be considered. It is reported that after Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian returns to Beijing from Guangzhou, he may make a final decision on this matter, so as to resume meetings as soon as possible this month.

### Acheson Responds to Reporters' Questions: US Has Always Been Sympathetic to China; Actively Reducing Troops on Chinese Coast

[US Information Service, Washington, 9th] At a press conference on the 9th, Secretary of State Acheson was asked whether the United States might issue a statement of sympathy if the Chinese government could unite in South China. Acheson replied: "The United States has always been sympathetic not only to the Chinese people, but also to the difficulties of the Chinese government." He emphasized: "The United States does not need to issue a statement of sympathy. American sympathy will always be a state of mind."

[United Press, New York, 9th] The World Telegram published an editorial on the 9th calling on the White House to clarify the US attitude toward China. The editorial stated that there is now significant evidence that "the Communist Party will encounter actual resistance as it advances south to Guangzhou." The editorial also pointed out that the Chinese government may move to Taiwan. The editorial asked: "What attitude will the United States take towards a Chinese government based in Taiwan, or will the United States support resistance against the Communist Party in South China?" The editorial also warned against recognizing a Communist or Communist-linked government in China, saying: "If we recognize a Communist or Communist-linked government, we cannot oppose ceding China's seat on the Security Council to the Communist Party. There is also the issue of Japanese reparations. If we recognize the Communist government, all reparations and material transfers will be given to the Communist Party. Are we going to hand over Japanese armories and war-supporting industries to the Communist Party? It is time for the State Department to issue a policy statement on these issues."

[United Press, Our City News] The United States is actively reducing its troops stationed on the Chinese coast for both economic and political reasons, which are now clear. The withdrawal of a new batch of Qingdao US Marines has left only about 2,000 US troops in China, one company each in Qingdao and Shanghai. The troops stationed there are all on ships to avoid the appearance of infringing on Chinese sovereignty. At the same time, the US Military Advisory Group in China ended last month, and most of its members have left China. However, there is still a large US Navy on Chinese waters, most of which are on ships. A British cruiser, an American cruiser, and a French cruiser were recently stationed in the Huangpu River, along with two British destroyers and an American transport ship carrying 600 US soldiers. In Nanjing's waters, there is also an American ship and a British ship. American expatriates in Shanghai are not overly concerned about the withdrawal of the US Marines in Qingdao because Guam and Okinawa are close by, and reinforcements can arrive within two days.

[United Press, Qingdao, 8th] 1,600 US Marine Corps soldiers departed on the 8th aboard the transport ships "Anrico" and "Renville," at least some of whom will return to San Diego. Commander of the US Western Pacific Fleet Brigadier General Bageley bid farewell to Marine Corps Commander Thomas before departing on the "Anrico." Currently, the US Navy in Qingdao has been reduced to only one company, most of which remain on ships, with only a few in onshore barracks. The American soldiers remaining on the ships are still tasked with protecting American property. Bageley believes that one company of Marines stationed in Qingdao and Shanghai is sufficient to cope with any eventuality.

### Communist Radio Station in Northern Shaanxi Broadcasts Criticism of US Aid to China Plan; Accuses it of Continuing Political Conspiracy

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco broadcast, a Communist radio station in northern Shaanxi broadcast on the 10th: "Various facts show that the US government is planning to actively assist the Kuomintang reactionaries. US Secretary of the Army Royal, Director of the Operations Planning Division of the Department of Defense Wedemeyer, and other senior officials of the US government and the Department of the Army went to Tokyo on the 1st of this month and held a conspiracy meeting with General MacArthur, commander of the US occupation forces in Japan, and General Barr, head of the US Joint Military Advisory Group to the Kuomintang government, on expanding assistance to the Kuomintang reactionaries in their dying struggles. At about the same time, US Pacific Fleet Commander Ramsay arrived in Shanghai on the 4th of this month, Qingdao on the 6th, and US Ambassador to the Nanjing puppet government Stuart also flew to Qingdao on the 7th and held secret talks with Ramsay and US Western Pacific Fleet Commander Bageley. On the 8th, Ramsay had flown from Qingdao to Tokyo to attend the meeting convened by Royal. According to reliable information: Stuart, Bageley, and Barr all advocated actively assisting the remnant forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries and wanted Chiang Kai-shek to reappear publicly in the near future to lead the civil war against the Chinese people. Responsible personnel of the US Congress and government, such as McCarran, chairman of the US Congressional Joint Committee for Overseeing Foreign Aid, have also recently issued calls to expand aid to the Kuomintang, because they saw that the aggressive forces of US imperialism in China were about to be completely wiped out, and the fake peace conspiracy that they had directed was also ruthlessly attacked by the Chinese people, so while continuing to carry out political conspiracies, they also re-advocated expanding aid to the Kuomintang reactionaries. However, the people believe that no matter what bet US imperialism makes, it will surely be won cleanly by the great Chinese people."

### US Army Reveals International Espionage Case on the Eve of World War II: Soviet Spies Stealing Important Japanese Intelligence; A Blend of Crime and Novel, Reading Like a Serial Film

[United Press International, Washington, 10th] The Department of the Army today released a report from McSherry in Tokyo, 32,000 words long, revealing a Soviet international espionage case in the Far East. This group of high-level spies, on the eve of World War II, stole confidential documents from the Japanese Cabinet and the German Embassy in Tokyo, learning that Germany would attack the Soviet Union, but Japan would not. This allowed the Soviet Union to calmly transfer troops stationed in Siberia to Moscow to stop the German advance, turning the tide of the war. This espionage network was perfectly organized and audacious beyond belief, unprecedented in history. The whole case is shocking and combines crime and fiction, reading like a Hollywood serial film. Most of the key perpetrators are deceased. The leader, a German named Sorge, and his assistant, a Japanese named Ozaki, were both hanged, but there are still accomplices at large, hiding in major cities. The American female writer Agnes Smedley is one of them. She recruited Sorge and Ozaki to work together in Shanghai between 1929 and 1933.

(Note: Regarding the partnership between Sorge and Ozaki, the Associated Press dispatch provided more detailed information: Ozaki's joining Sorge's spy ring was due to Smedley's introduction, around the end of 1929 or the beginning of 1930. Ozaki was working as a Shanghai correspondent for the "Asahi Shimbun" in Tokyo. He first became involved with the "Creation Society," a left-leaning literary organization in Shanghai, and later, through the Chinese Communist Youth League, came into contact with advisors and leaders of the CCP in Shanghai. At that time, he often strolled around a bookstore near Suzhou Creek. Through the introduction of the bookstore owner, Mrs. Witke, he met Miss Smedley, and from then on, he began his espionage career. Later, Smedley arranged a meeting at a hotel on Nanjing Road, introducing him to a European named "Johnson," establishing contact. It was not until six years later, when he returned from the United States in 1936 to participate in a conference hosted by the Institute of Pacific Relations as a Japanese representative, that he learned Johnson's real name was Sorge, because a Dutch representative introduced him as "Charlie Sorge.")

Another German, Stein, has apparently been naturalized as an American citizen and was also a key member of the group at the time. His resume is unknown, but it is only known that he and Smedley both wrote books about China. (Note: Stein authored the book "Red China's Challenge.") According to the directory, their mailing address is in New York City. There were no Soviet citizens in the party, and with the exception of a few people, they were all Japanese. Most of the accomplices have been released, including three Japanese residing in Los Angeles for a long time: Miyagi, Akiyama, and Kitabayashi. Miyagi is an artist, and Akiyama is a translator. They joined the party purely out of economic necessity. Kitabayashi is a female tailor who eventually confessed the whole truth. The value of the intelligence obtained by the spy network is inestimable. In the summer and autumn of 1941, they understood the trend of the Japanese-American negotiations and were close to Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe, but they did not seem to know that Japan would attack Pearl Harbor. The report did not mention whether they had contact with Soviet spies in the United States, but only that a key figure in the House Un-American Activities Committee investigation last year was also involved in this. The Japanese government's past publication of the trial process was very brief. The truth was not known until after the US military occupied Japan. This public announcement by the Department of the Army is intended to warn people to pay attention to domestic spies and take appropriate precautions. The conspiracy of the Far East spies is exciting, quite legendary. Private torture, self-made passwords, forged passports, the use of cigarette packs to store miniature films to transmit messages, or the transfer of money during theater screenings, their secret radio stations were never set up in the same location twice. Sorge was a member of the German Communist Party, posing as a Nazi, using the name of a journalist to represent four newspapers, including the Frankfurter Zeitung, to interview in Tokyo, secretly engaging in activities. The German Embassy was worried about being controlled by him. He was a burly, cruel man who was fond of alcohol and women. He had a wife in the Soviet Union and another elementary school teacher in the United States as a concubine. Sorge reported the situation of Japanese military and industry to the Soviet government in detail at any time. He collected a wealth of information on the deployment of Japanese troops and secret weapons, but it was of secondary nature. The scope of intelligence he collected was extensive, covering the British, American, French, and German embassies in Japan, as well as the Dutch embassy, the Japanese Cabinet, the Army and Navy Ministries, as well as news articles and street talks. He sorted them out item by item, sought the opinions of Ozaki and Miyagi, and then cross-checked with the German ambassador to reach a conclusion, and then reported to Moscow. The method of delivery varied. Sometimes he used wireless telegraphs, sometimes he sent special messengers to carry miniature films to Shanghai, and sometimes he handed them over through the Soviet Embassy. (Continued on page 2)

Editorial

### The Japanese Political Situation After the Opening of Parliament

The new Japanese parliament is scheduled to open on February 11th. According to the results of the general election on January 23rd, the Democratic Liberal Party led by Shigeru Yoshida will dominate this parliament. Given the overwhelming advantage of the Democratic Liberal Party in the new parliament, Yoshida's re-election as prime minister is, of course, without question. What we need to pay attention to now is whether the future Yoshida Cabinet will take the path of a one-party government or adopt the posture of a coalition government. What is its nature? What kind of future will it advance Japanese politics to?

According to the new Japanese constitution, the Prime Minister of the Cabinet is appointed by the leader of the majority party elected by the House of Representatives, and the seat of the Speaker of the House of Representatives is also dominated by the majority party by custom. This is the model of the close relationship between the Japanese legislature and the executive branch. The Japanese House of Representatives has a total of 466 seats. In the general election on January 23, the Democratic Liberal Party overwhelmed all other parties with more than 260 seats, and the party legally obtained the status of the first party. According to Article 67 of the new constitution, when electing a prime minister, the prime minister nominated and elected by the Democratic Liberal Party is absolutely impossible to overturn. Japanese newspapers unanimously agree that Yoshida's third term as prime minister is inevitable, and the seat of the Speaker of the House of Representatives may be taken by the party's top advisor, Kijuro Shidehara. Therefore, the first thing the new parliament, which opens on the 11th, will do is to determine that the Democratic Liberal Party is the master of the executive and legislative branches, and that the future politics will be led by the Democratic Liberal Party. All other parties, whether or not they participate in the cabinet, cannot have an influence or compete for power in the current regime.

Since the Democratic Liberal Party has such an advantage, it should have convened the new parliament without reservation after the general election last month and realized the third Yoshida Cabinet as soon as possible. However, in fact, Yoshida delayed the convening until February 11th. The reason for this is that he used this gap to try his best to win over Takeshi Inukai of the Democratic Party, to appease the Socialist Party, which suffered a disastrous defeat in the election, and to try to win over this group of center-right parties to join the future cabinet, so that the future government would formally constitute a coalition government, making his leading conservative front stronger and more solid. Due to the poor mood of the Socialist Party after the competition failed, the internal camp was disordered, and the difficulty of power distribution between the Democratic Party and Yoshida, Takeshi Inukai rejected the invitation to join the cabinet when he visited Yoshida on the 4th, and Yoshida felt quite hesitant and disappointed. Yoshida is originally a political ambitious person, his words are big and exaggerated, and he does not take anyone seriously. Judging from his arrogant attitude in organizing the cabinet twice, even the Democratic Party with the same conservative trend refused to cooperate with him, which shows that Yoshida's third cabinet will be based on one party and cannot appear in the posture of a coalition government. Even if other small parties participate in one or two seats, Yoshida will not take them seriously. According to Japanese sources, the Democratic Liberal Party internally urged Yoshida to abandon contact with the Democratic and Socialist parties and form a one-party cabinet, and believed that a dictatorial and autocratic government could better implement administrative orders than a coalition government. Yoshida originally had this idea, this ambition, so it is expected that his final decision will undoubtedly be influenced by his internal opinions. Judging from the situation, his close friend George Hayashi will be re-appointed as Deputy Prime Minister, and the current Minister of Commerce and Industry, Sango Oya, may be appointed as Minister of Finance. Other personnel arrangements are no different from the second and third-rate figures in the current cabinet, and are completely incompetent cabinets under dictatorial rule. It is difficult to believe that such a cabinet will advance Japanese politics to "democratic politics."

After the third appearance of the Yoshida Cabinet, it is impossible to have innovation or rectification in politics. It will take a conservative policy approach, on the one hand, suppressing labor forces, exploiting public officials, and strengthening the crackdown on left-wing forces, and on the other hand, it will take the implementation of the nine principles of Japanese economic recovery instructed by the Allied Headquarters as its highest mission, practicing the old and outdated capitalist policies of not dissolving the zaibatsu and promoting business management and industrial rationalization. Apart from reviving the old Japan and deepening labor opposition, it is naturally impossible to do anything for the future of Japanese economic democratization. Therefore, it is most regrettable that Japan has already surrendered for three years, not only is the peace treaty with Japan indefinitely delayed, but on the contrary, the principles left by the Potsdam Proclamation have been destroyed. Now, the old Japan is intact, and the new Japan cannot be promoted. The deterioration of Japan's future is a very worrying thing in the Far East. We look at the appearance of the Yoshida Cabinet with this perspective, and we pay attention to the future of Japanese politics with this perspective.

### Shocking International Espionage Case (Continued from Page 1)

The purpose of this spy ring's mission was to investigate Japanese military strength, industrial development, policies towards China, diplomatic relations between Japan and Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and the extent of military interference in politics, with particular emphasis on whether Japan intended to attack the Soviet Union. Ozaki was a reporter for the Asahi Shimbun and an expert on China. He had a close friendship with key figures in the Japanese government from their student days. Later, through a friend's introduction, he became an advisor on Chinese affairs to the cabinet, and Prime Minister Konoe regarded him as a confidant, consulting him on all confidential matters. Another important spy, a Yugoslav named Vukelic, specialized in gathering information from the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. Vukelic was a reporter for a Yugoslav newspaper and later worked for the French Havas news agency, becoming close friends with Cox, the editor of Reuters in Shanghai. Cox was sent to Japan, but his unauthorized reporting led to his arrest, and he died after jumping from a window at the Tokyo police station. Vukelic had a photography lab in his home, run by a German named Klausen. Klausen met with Soviet agent Otto in Harbin in 1920 and established two private rooms with a private radio station in the residence of US Vice Consul Li Liansiquan. Mr. Li himself also provided information and was transferred to be Consul in Scotland in 1935 and died in Mexico in 1943.

Complex Spy Ring Organization

Sorge only managed the upper levels of the spy network, while the lower levels were commanded by Ozaki and Miyagi. There were factions within the party, and the organization was complex. Some members did not even know who their leader was. In 1939, Sorge reported to the Soviet Union that Japan had decided to expand its armored divisions and mechanize its army. In the spring of 1940, he reported the production numbers of Japanese munitions, aircraft, automobiles, and steel factories. In the autumn of 1941, he reported that Japan had enough gasoline to supply its navy for two years and its army for half a year. On May 20 of the same year, he urgently reported that Germany would concentrate a large army of 170 to 190 divisions on the Soviet border and launch an attack along the entire line on June 20, with the main offensive aimed at Moscow. Subsequently, the German army did attack the Soviet Union on June 22, only two days after Sorge's report. On July 2, after the closing of the Imperial Conference in Japan, Sorge again reported to the Soviet side that the Japanese government had decided to invade Vietnam and seize bases. In late July and early August, he reported that Japan had mobilized one million men, most of whom were sent to China.

The Most Important Report

At the end of August, he reported that the German embassy had given up hope of persuading Japan to declare war on the Soviet Union that year. Because Ozaki was friendly with Konoe and knew the details of the Japanese-American negotiations, Sorge submitted his final report on October 15, stating that Japan had decided to advance south and that the Siberian border was no longer in danger of attack from the Kwantung Army. He believed his mission was complete and requested to be recalled to the Soviet Union. Unexpectedly, he was suddenly arrested by the Japanese government three days later. The reason for the arrest was purely accidental. A female spy named Kitabayashi was a member of the Japanese Communist Party, but Sorge had instructed his subordinates not to associate with the Japanese Communist Party. The leader of the Japanese Communist Party, Ito, believed that Kitabayashi had severed ties with the Communist Party for a long time and was afraid that she had changed her views and opposed communism. Although he did not know that she was indeed a spy, he reported her to the police. The police arrested Kitabayashi on September 28 of that year, and the rest were arrested in October. Three years later, Sorge and Ozaki were hanged, while Miyagi and Vukelic died in prison. Klausen was sentenced to life imprisonment, later released by the US military, and now lives in the Soviet Union with his wife. Nakanishi, a Japanese national who headed the Soviet spy ring in China, was also arrested in Shanghai and sentenced to life imprisonment. After being released by the US military, he participated in the general election last April.

[United Press, Tokyo, 10th] Former Japanese prosecutors Tamazawa and Ota, who participated in the Sorge case trial, told United Press reporters today that former Prime Minister Tojo tried to save Sorge from prison. When Sorge was arrested, Tojo was notified. Tojo told the prosecutors that loyal Nazi members would never be Soviet spies and should be released. However, Tojo changed his mind when he learned that Sorge had provided the most confidential information to the Kremlin. According to seized documents, it was proven that Sorge and others had telegraphed information to the Fourth Headquarters of the Red Army in Moscow.

Secret Payment in Movie Theaters

The funds received by Sorge and others were initially withdrawn from the deposits of the American Communist Party in Japanese banks. Shortly before the Pacific War, after Japan implemented foreign exchange controls, Sorge's funds came directly from the Soviet Embassy, in a dramatic fashion. Sorge's hired assistants could periodically obtain two movie tickets for a certain theater in Tokyo from a postal mailbox. The assistant and his wife could go to see the movie, and the person sitting next to them would be a counselor from the Soviet Embassy, who would hand over the funds wrapped in a newspaper to the assistant. In the first week after his arrest, Sorge refused to confess, but after Sorge's appeal to the German ambassador for help failed, he finally confessed.

Information Sent Directly to Stalin

[United Press, Tokyo, 10th] A Japanese official who spoke with the deceased master spy Sorge today admitted that the Japanese army's defeat by the Soviet army in the Nomonhan Incident of 1939 was caused by Sorge. It is said that in the spring of 1939, Japanese military personnel obtained important information from General Rogov, the head of Soviet military intelligence in the Far East. During a visit to Manchuria, Rogov revealed to agents in the Kwantung Army General Staff the locations of Soviet troops in the Far East and other information. This information was passed on to a German officer, who reported it to Sorge, a confidant of the German Embassy. Sorge presented all the information to Soviet Premier Stalin. As a result, the Far Eastern Red Army commanders were replaced, and the locations of the troops were completely changed. In May of that year, the Kwantung Army, based on the information obtained, attacked Nomonhan, a border area between Manchuria and Outer Mongolia, believing that the Soviet defense line there was the weakest and that a successful battle could be won. Unexpectedly, the defense line there was not weak at all, and there were as many as nine Soviet divisions stationed there. The Japanese army was trapped in an encirclement. By the time the war ended in August, the Kwantung Army had lost more than 20,000 elite soldiers and was crestfallen. After learning a lesson from this battle, the Japanese army recognized the strength of the Soviet army and changed its strategy, intending to advance south, which led to the Pacific War. At the same time, the Japanese army expanded its mechanized units and established armored divisions.

Soviet Espionage Group Selection

[United Press, Tokyo, 10th] A senior Japanese official told United Press reporters today that Sorge, the leader of the international spy ring, was selected by the espionage group directly organized by the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. He was present throughout the interrogation of Sorge, and Sorge insisted that he did not know whether there were similar spy rings elsewhere other than in China, but he provided detailed information about the organization of his own group. The Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party organized a secret intelligence group to understand the internal affairs of various countries and cooperated with the Communist International and the Communist parties of various countries to assist its espionage groups. Sorge and others were directly selected by the secret intelligence group of the Central Committee but were trained in the espionage school established by the Fourth Group of the Red Army. The school also trained radio operators to transmit information. The Fourth Group of the Red Army collected and transmitted espionage reports to the secret intelligence group, and Soviet diplomatic couriers were responsible for providing funds to the spy ring. Sorge and others first established an agency in China in 1929. After the Japanese army occupied the Northeast and controlled North China, Sorge and others moved their center of operations to Tokyo several years before the outbreak of World War II. Ozaki, a Japanese national, was also selected by the Moscow secret intelligence group to cooperate with Sorge.

[United Press, Washington, 9th] The War Department announced today that the espionage report on the Far East case expressed surprise at the fairness of the trial. It is said that Japan, in the midst of the war, captured the most dangerous spy in history and gave him all the protections provided by Japanese law, which makes one feel interested and even surprised by the quality of Japanese justice. At the same time, it is surprising that only two of the twenty or so male and female criminals were sentenced to death, because according to Japanese law, every defendant could have been sentenced to death.

Smedley Denies

[United Press, New York, 9th] Miss Agnes Smedley, a native of Missouri, a well-known writer who was accused by the War Department of being a member of the largest spy ring in the Far East, denounced the allegation on the 9th as a "despicable lie." She accused the intelligence officers at MacArthur Headquarters who prepared the report of acting on the basis of a "malicious political motive." In a statement to the press, she said, "I am not and have never been a Soviet spy or staff member for any country." Her lawyer, former Federal Prosecutor Rogge, also wrote to Secretary of the Army Royall, demanding "the immediate retraction of this irresponsible and false attack."

Stein Refuses to Explain

[United Press, New York, 10th] Noted writer Gunther Stein, one of those accused by the War Department of being a member of Sorge's spy ring, refused to comment on the matter on the 10th. When a reporter contacted him by telephone and asked if he was the Stein mentioned in the War Department report, he replied, "I think so!" When the reporter asked for an explanation of the matter, he said, "I'm very sorry, I have nothing to say now, perhaps I will explain it later."

### New Japanese Parliament Opens Today - Yoshida Cabinet to Undergo Formal Resignation and Reappointment - Liberal Party Resolves to Implement Anti-Communist Policy

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] Japan's fifth special Diet session after the war will convene on the 11th, lasting for a total of 70 days, closing on April 30. However, the issue of this term still needs to be formally approved by the House of Representatives before it can be finalized. In this meeting, the Prime Minister's nomination and voting must be held first, after which the meeting will be temporarily adjourned to await the formation of the new cabinet. Since the Democratic Liberal Party has already obtained an absolute majority of seats in the House of Representatives, the process of Yoshida Shigeru's nomination should be completed smoothly. Observers predict that Yoshida Shigeru will resolutely form a single-party cabinet of the Democratic Liberal Party this time. The new cabinet may be formed within this month, and the resumption of the Diet session will be in the early part of next month.

[Another dispatch] The Japanese cabinet held a temporary cabinet meeting on the 10th, and all cabinet members unanimously decided to resign en masse. The letter of resignation will be submitted to the Diet on the morning of the 11th, so that after the Diet convenes, the new Prime Minister nomination process can be held based on the fact of this mass resignation.

[Another dispatch] The Democratic Party held an advisory meeting on the 9th, in which the party president, Inukai Ken, appointed Hori Shigeru as the new Secretary-General, Chiba Saburo as the Chairman of the Policy Research Council, Inagaki Heitaro as the Chairman of the General Affairs Council, and Fukuda Seikichi as the Deputy Chairman of the General Affairs Council. The party has decided to assist the Democratic Liberal Party cabinet from outside the cabinet. The party has agreed to vote for the new Prime Minister Yoshida when the Diet holds the Prime Minister nomination on the 11th. Inukai, the president of the Democratic Party, also visited Yoshida at the Foreign Minister's residence at 4:00 p.m. on the 10th for the second round of talks between the two party leaders. It is rumored that Inukai may participate in the new Yoshida cabinet.

[Another dispatch] Democratic Party President Inukai Ken met with Democratic Liberal Party President Yoshida at the Foreign Minister's residence at 4:30 p.m. on the 10th, and then visited MacArthur together at 5:00 p.m. Afterwards, they returned to the Foreign Minister's residence to continue the talks. The content of the talks was about the unification of the conservative front, and it is said that considerable progress has been made.

[United Press, Tokyo, 10th] Prime Minister Yoshida, on the eve of his re-election as Prime Minister, held a press conference, saying that he "will fight the Communists to the end." He said that his Democratic Liberal Party's anti-Communist policy will be fully implemented, even if the Japanese Communist Party gains control in the Diet. In past talks, Yoshida had never revealed his concern about the JCP's subversive activities. In a private interview with a United Press reporter, he only stated that if the American occupation forces withdrew before the time was ripe, the expansion of communism in Asia might quickly involve Japan.

### Four Powers Continue Discussion on Austrian Peace Treaty - Soviet Union and Yugoslavia Propose Compensation Claims - Yugoslav Foreign Minister Suddenly Arrives in London but is Refused Attendance at Meeting - Issue of Displaced Persons Reaches Stalemate

[This newspaper's report] London, 10th broadcast: The Soviet Union has notified the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference on the Austrian Peace Treaty that the Western powers' refusal to invite Yugoslavia to attend the meeting is considered an "ultimatum." The Soviet chief representative, Tsarapkin, repeatedly requested permission for Yugoslavia to attend the second day of the meeting, but the Western countries insisted that unless Tsarapkin could guarantee that Yugoslavia might propose new suggestions, they would refuse its attendance at the meeting.

The Four Power Foreign Ministers have also reached a stalemate on the issue of refugees. Tsarapkin advocated that Austria be forced to repatriate an estimated 500,000 refugees, regardless of whether they were willing to leave Austria or not. US representative Reber said that the United States could not agree to the forced repatriation of refugees. Britain suggested that the entire issue be removed from the Austrian Peace Treaty, but Tsarapkin rejected this move. The Western powers hoped that Yugoslav Foreign Minister Bebler, who suddenly arrived in London on the night of the 9th, might propose a compromise suggestion regarding the economic clauses. The ambassadors of the United Kingdom and the United States are expected to hold informal talks with Bebler within the next few days.

[United Press, London, 10th] The United States allowed a new effort to relax its demands for compensation from Austria on the 10th. The final claim would most likely have to be paid by American taxpayers. The demands of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia on Austria when the Four Powers discussed the Austrian Peace Treaty were submitted to the Four Power representatives. Yugoslavia demanded compensation of $150 million, and the Soviet Union also demanded this amount, and both wanted it to be paid in US dollars. US representative Reber was deeply concerned that this number would shake Austria's already unstable economy. The United States is currently providing aid to Austria through the Marshall Plan, and any economic resources squeezed from Austria, especially US dollars, would have to be paid by the United States. Western countries are closely watching for any signs that the Soviet Union is preparing to not support Yugoslavia's demands on Austria. British sources expect the next two days to show whether this meeting will be successful.

[British Information Office, London, 10th] Foreign Secretary Bevin refused in the House of Commons on the 9th to guarantee that the United Kingdom would not be drawn into the war as a belligerent in the event of a war between the United States and the Soviet Union. He made this statement in response to a question from Labour MP Chamberlain. Chamberlain asked, "Will the Foreign Secretary provide assurance that the British government's policy based on the proposed Atlantic Pact will not have any clauses that would obligate this country to automatically become a belligerent in the event of a war between the United States and the Soviet Union?" Bevin replied that he did not intend to provide such an assurance.

### US House Passes Bill - Restoring Reciprocal Trade

Export Control Act Approved by Senate

[United Press, Washington, 9th] The House of Representatives today voted 319 to 69 to abolish the tariff law passed by the Republican Congress and restore the original Reciprocal Trade Act, which is valid until June 12, 1951. The bill has now been sent to the Senate for discussion. When President Truman proposed the bill, he said that the old Republican law hindered trade agreement negotiations and that its abolition would promote commerce and help world peace. Before the House vote, Rules Committee Chairman Thornton urged members of Congress to remove trade barriers and make it clear to the world that the United States had resolutely and permanently broken away from economic and political isolationism. The original Reciprocal Trade Act stipulated that the President could reduce the tax rate on January 1, 1945 by 50% in trade agreements, provided that the signatory country also agreed to do the same as an exchange condition.

[US Information Agency, Washington, 9th] A bill proposing to extend the control of exports of certain scarce materials until June 30, 1951, was approved by the Senate on Tuesday and will now be sent to the House of Representatives for action. The current controls on steel, tin, meat, and grain are due to expire at the end of February. The new measure will extend these controls for 28 months. During the Senate discussion of this bill, it was revealed that some senators did not agree with the general principle of export controls but recognized the need to continue controls until the domestic supply situation improved.

[This newspaper's report] Washington, 10th broadcast: President Truman today strongly condemned the Hungarian government's trial of Archbishop József Mindszenty at a press conference, calling it an "outrage," and said that the US government was studying whether the Hungarian government had violated any treaties in this trial.

### The City's Power Plants Face Shutdown; Hope for Electricity Prices to Adjust with Exchange Rates

According to the heads of Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, Huashang Electric Company, and Pudong Electric Company, the recently adjusted electricity prices, effective from February 1st, are based on a coal price of 5,000 yuan per ton and a foreign exchange transfer certificate price of 171 yuan for cost calculation. Since February 1st, prices have soared, causing each company to use all electricity revenue from January to purchase coal. The difference is significant, and other expenses have no source of funding. Economic difficulties have reached an extreme. They have reached a point of desperation. To effectively remedy the situation, the only solution is to adjust electricity prices along with fluctuations in the market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates. Otherwise, they will be unable to maintain production, and the entire city's supply may be interrupted.

However, neither of these actions constitutes a crime in law, so the two defendants Tong and Lu were found not guilty. The victim's mother, Dai Yunsu, requested that the court find a way to bring Shen Qier to justice after hearing the verdict, and left in disappointment.

Holders were very reluctant to sell, and all markets steadily increased slightly. Dragon Head Fine Cloth was quoted at 9,600 yuan outside the market at noon. The supply of medium-grade fine cloth chips was still scarce, so the price rose significantly. For example, Trumpet Boy Fine Cloth squeezed up 120 yuan, opening at 8,250 yuan, but the price then fell to 8,100 yuan due to ample supply from retailers taking profits at high prices. Finally, it progressed again to a close of 8,300 yuan. Other items, such as B Dragon Head Fine Cloth, etc., were also up about 110 yuan.

Tea Market Brisk

Since the tea market returned to a restrained stance the day before yesterday, yesterday's market negotiations, although quite active, were perceived by sellers as the credit tightness slightly easing. Furthermore, because tea inventories had not increased, they stubbornly held onto their goods, reluctant to let go, so the outcome of negotiations between the two sides remained unsatisfactory. Transactions were sporadic, and not many deals were made, but the market still appeared brisk, and prices showed signs of improving.

### Silk Recovers

Yesterday's silk market was still stable, and prices were still hovering. Supply and demand in the market were still balanced. Yesterday, credit in the market slightly eased, and overnight interest rates initially rose and then fell back. Floor rates initially did six corners, then did not reach five corners. At the noon close, each counter showed slight improvement. 120 Tianqiao was initially called at 350,000, and in the middle, upon hearing that gold prices were still good and that off-market prices showed slight gains, the trading floor started to hype the price again, briefly reaching 365,000 yuan.

### Credit Gradually Becomes Stable; Transfer Certificate Rises Ten Yuan

Credit in the market is gradually becoming stable. The Central Bank was occupied by Northeast soldiers and civilians, and all business was at a standstill. The sell-off of goods was slightly hindered. However, off-market positions were mostly covered short, and dealers also supplied more funds, making turnover more flexible than before. Market interbank lending rates were between 50 yuan and 60 yuan per 1,000 yuan. Cash chips were quite popular because withdrawals within the industry were not possible, but there was rarely any premium.

The foreign exchange transfer certificate opened firm, with bids at 850 yuan and offers at 900 yuan. Then, due to the rising price of black market gold and banknotes, it rose all the way, breaking through the 900 yuan mark, with buyers at 930 yuan. Foreign firms and bank groups vigorously sold, and the price declined in a winding manner. At the noon market, designated commercial banks bid at 860 yuan and offered at 890 yuan, up ten yuan from yesterday.
