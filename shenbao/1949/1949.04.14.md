Although the future of the peace talks is not without difficulties, he is willing to travel to Beiping at the urging of all parties to assist and facilitate.

### Issue of Renewing Sino-Soviet Aviation Agreement

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The issue of renewing the Sino-Soviet aviation agreement was submitted for discussion at the Executive Yuan's routine meeting on the 13th. The Soviet side intends to renew it, requesting a validity period of twenty years. After detailed research by the political committee members, which took a long time, no conclusion was reached.

### Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economic Affairs and Budget Committees Jointly Review Financial Bills; Differing Opinions Among Committee Members Did Not Reach Conclusion

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The amended financial reform bill submitted by the Executive Yuan for review was submitted for review by the Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economic Affairs Committee and Budget Committee at a joint meeting on the 13th. Zhu Huiqing's proposal to request the government to drastically change its financial measures and Qiu Hanping's proposal to implement a silver standard and issue banknotes were also discussed together. Zhang Jingyu chaired the meeting, and Finance Minister Liu Gongyun attended to report on the differences between the amended bill and the original bill, explaining them one by one. Then, the committee members expressed their opinions and raised questions. Li Yunliang advocated for stipulating a gold unit as a unified value standard, saying that silver dollars should not be used as a unified value calculation standard because the number of silver dollars is too small, they are not widely used, and they are easily targeted for panic buying, causing drastic price fluctuations. He advocated imitating the pre-war customs gold unit system, that is, expanding the scope of the current customs gold unit system, stipulating that one gold unit is equal to forty US cents or a certain amount of gold. This gold unit is only for the value calculation standard and does not issue banknotes or coins. The exchange rate between each gold unit and gold yuan coupons is posted daily by central banks in various places as the standard for actual payment. The budgets of all levels of government, various taxes, the rates of various transportation and public utilities, various prices, various salary compensation (including the salaries of civil servants and soldiers), various deposits, discounting loans, and other calculations related to exchange value are all calculated according to the gold unit. The ratio of banks to gold units is also posted daily by the central bank. "Silver dollars," "customs gold units," and "tax dollars" can all be converted into gold units. Other relevant articles, such as production loans and value-preserved deposits, all use the gold unit as a unified unit of calculation. Zhu Huiqing agreed with Li's opinion and believed that the government had failed to grasp the use of the monetary standard, using silver dollars and gold on the one hand and issuing gold yuan coupons on the other, which accelerated the collapse of gold yuan coupons. Implementing the bank standard system can only encourage imports and stifle exports. Liu Shijian questioned whether the policy of selling gold could be maintained for a long time. Does the Ministry of Finance have confidence? Bao Huaguo advocated that the government should come up with capital and stop plundering the big families. If one hundred million in foreign exchange can be used to improve the treatment of soldiers and public servants and stabilize the currency value, then military and political conditions will surely change for the better in two or three months, and tax revenue will also be improved. Wu Gan questioned four points: (1) Song Ziwen went to Taiwan, reportedly to improve the Taiwan dollar. Does he want to use the country's gold? (2) If remote provinces establish their own currency systems independently, does the Ministry of Finance have a way to stop them? (3) When can the property tax be prepared? (4) Why not use the method of allocating public bonds to balance finances? Liu Quanzhong believed that the amendment was just a method of increasing taxes, but if there is no better method, it can be considered for implementation, and he also advocated issuing public bonds and using the gold standard calculation method. The meeting continued in the afternoon. First, Li Yunliang's proposed amendments to the bill were discussed item by item. The committee members spoke enthusiastically, and the opinions were summarized into four points: (1) Adopting a unified calculation standard unit; (2) Using customs gold units for paying customs duties and other taxes; (3) Using tax dollars as the standard unit for all taxation; (4) Using the price index as the calculation standard. Finally, when the above four opinions were put to a vote, the committee members had differing opinions, causing a heated debate. No conclusion was reached until 6 PM in the afternoon, and it was decided to submit this case to the next meeting of the Executive Yuan for discussion. (News of other committee meetings of the Legislative Yuan is published on the second page.)

### Navy Exerts Power; Continues to Create Brilliant Battle Lines; Recovers Datuan Mountain on the North Bank of Central Anhui

[Our Newspaper's Wuhu Dispatch, 13th] In the battle to defend the Jiangbei bridgehead, the Navy has recently exerted unparalleled power and established new achievements after the Anqing campaign. Since the 7th, the 79th and 2nd Corps of the Communist army under Chen Yi have continued to attack the bridgehead positions in Tuqiao, Yuxikou, Ji Temple (north bank of Wuhu), Xixishan, Huayang, and other places in Jiangbei, Central Anhui. Among them, the fighting was initially the fiercest in the Xiliang Mountain area. On the 9th, the fighting also reached its climax. Relying on the Navy's intense fire network of firing 3,000 rounds per hour, the attacking Communist army was completely repelled in coordination with the army. Datuan Mountain, the forward position of Xiliang Mountain that was once captured by the Communist army on the 9th, was also completely recovered on the morning of the 13th. It is reported that the Communist army, unable to overcome the repeated attacks, abandoned Xiliang Mountain starting on the night of the 12th and shifted its focus to the Yuxikou and Ji Temple areas across the river from Wuhu as the main points of attack. By noon, they had also been completely repelled by the National Army in coordination with the Navy, Army, and Air Force. According to the statistics of the Navy's Jiangfang Fleet, the Communist army suffered over 3,000 casualties when attacking Tuqiao, over 6,000 in Xiliang Mountain, over 3,000 in Ji Temple, over 2,000 in Huayang, and over 8,000 in Yuxikou, totaling over 20,000 people.

### Has the CCP Issued an Order to Stop Attacking? Intense Battles Widespread on Jiangbei Front; Communist Army Attempting to Cross the River at Various Places Repelled

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] According to reliable sources, the CCP Central Committee, at the request of the government representatives, ordered the front-line Communist army to stop attacking on the 10th. However, because the front-line Communist army continued to attack, the government representatives reported this matter to the CCP representative Zhou Enlai. The CCP then re-ordered the front-line Communist army to stop attacking through Mao Zedong. However, according to military officials who spoke to reporters, there were still battles on some bridgehead positions on the Jiangbei front on the morning of the 13th, especially in Yuxikou and its surrounding areas across the river from Wuhu. The Communist army's offensive abated slightly starting in the afternoon.

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Another official source claimed on the 13th that Gu Zhutong, Chief of the General Staff of the Ministry of National Defense, confirmed that the CCP's order to stop attacking had been issued, based on the Communist army's withdrawal action. As for the fact that some areas are still under attack, it may be due to inconvenient transportation and the order not being able to reach them.

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] There were still battles on the Jiangbei front from the night of the 12th to the morning of the 13th, especially in Gaoqiao (opposite Dagang east of Zhenjiang), Yongan Island (sandbar in the river south of Longwo in Kouan), Hejiadagang (north of Yangzhou), and Yuxikou and Zhonglugang (opposite Wuhu). (1) In the Gaoqiao area, the Communist army took advantage of the narrow river surface, which is only three li away from Dagang on the south bank. On the night of the 12th, they attempted to cross the river with over 3,000 Communist troops in over a hundred boats of various types. To eliminate the threat to Zhenjiang and the central section of the Nanjing-Shanghai line, the National Army, under the personal planning and deployment of Generals Tang Enbo and Gui Yongqing, and with the coordination of the Air Force, launched a full-scale counterattack against the Communist army from 5:00 AM on the 13th. After a fierce battle until about 9:30 AM, the attacking Communist army was completely defeated. In addition to completely recovering the key points of Gaoqiao and its nearby Xin Island and Lotus Pond, the reconstruction of the bridgehead on the north bank was completed on the same day. (2) In the Yongan Island area, on the night of the 12th, the Communist army also used over a hundred boats of various types to sneak across to Yongan Island in the river from Longwo in Kouan. Before the morning of the 13th, they were completely repelled by the National Army, killing and wounding over 600 Communist troops and sinking over ten boats. (3) In the Hejiadagang area, on the night of the 12th, over thirty wooden boats, fully loaded with Communist troops, attempted to sneak across from Sanjiangying to the vicinity of the port. Six boats were sunk, over 200 Communist troops were killed and wounded, and the remaining boats retreated to Jiangbei. (4) In the Yuxikou and Zhongluxiang areas, the Communist army's attack was also fierce starting at 10 PM on the night of the 12th. By noon on the 13th, they had been completely repelled by the defending troops. In addition, small groups of Communist troops attacked the mountains north of Jiangpu City, the Xianding Bridge in the Flag Camp on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, and the outskirts of Anqing on the night of the 12th, but they were all completely repelled by the National Army.

[Our Newspaper's Wuhu Dispatch, 13th] On the night of the 12th, over a thousand Communist troops from the Wangjiang Northeast Zhanghe Saikou area opposite Dongliu, took wooden boats to attempt to sneak across to Jiyang between Dadukou and Dongliu, but were repelled by the defending troops on the south bank.

[Our Newspaper's Zhenjiang Dispatch, 13th] Official News: Over two thousand Communist troops from the Gaoqiao area in the center of the river opposite the Dagang area of Zhenjiang. Artillery and a large number of boats were discovered in the Xinzhou area to build a pontoon bridge, attempting to cross the river. They came into contact with the alert troops at about 6:00 AM on the 13th. The Communist troops retreated north at about 9:00 AM.

[Our Newspaper's Zhenjiang Dispatch, 13th] It is reported that the main force of the Communist army is now concentrating from Yangzhou towards Taixian and Taixing, with unclear intentions. In addition, the main force of four regiments of the 7th Column of the Communist army is now concentrated in the area around Shijiaqiao on the Yangzhou-Liuhe line.

### The Arrest of Xu Wentian and Jin Shaoxian: Control Yuan Decides to Conduct Investigation; Rumor That the Garrison Command Will Rearrest Xu Denied

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Regarding the arrest of legislators Jin Shaoxian and Xu Wentian, after a heated debate during the Control Yuan discussion meeting on the afternoon of the 13th, it was decided to appoint members Zhao Xi and Wang Zhenhua to conduct an investigation in order to clarify the facts and then decide how to handle the matter. During the meeting, Liu Pingjiang spoke first, believing that the arrest of Xu Wentian and Jin Shaoxian by the arresting authorities was unconstitutional and should be thoroughly investigated. Zhang Dinghua shared the same opinion as Liu Pingjiang. Hu Wenhui, based on the provisions of the criminal law regarding offenders caught in the act, believed that according to newspaper reports, Xu's case involved an offender caught in the act, and the arrest was not illegal. If the newspaper reports were inaccurate, an investigation should be conducted, and before clarification, it could not be hastily concluded that the arrest by the authorities was illegal. Subsequently, Liu Xingzhi stood up and criticized the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Command for being unconstitutional. Hu Wenhui stood up again and engaged in a heated debate with him, arguing for a long time. Wang Xiangchen, Gu Fengxiang, Li Zhengle, and others also expressed that an investigation should be conducted first. Finally, it was decided to have Wang Zhenhua and Zhao Xi investigate before deciding on the attitude and steps the Control Yuan should take.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Chen Kewen, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, denied on the evening of the 13th that the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Command had requested the rearrest of legislator Xu Wentian and the detention of six other legislators. According to reports, when the Garrison Command sent Xu Wentian back, it sent a letter to the Executive Yuan to complete the arrest procedures. The letter also included an arrest warrant and requested the Legislative Yuan to detain six other legislators so that they could be sent back to Shanghai for trial along with Xu. Chen stated that this was not the case. He claimed that he had inquired with Huang Shao-gu, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, who said that there was no such official letter.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Regarding the arrest of legislators Xu Wentian and Jin Shaoxian, President He presented a report at the political affairs meeting on the 13th.

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 13th] Zhang Shaohua, Director of the Suzhou Water Police Bureau, published a notice in various newspapers on the 13th denying that he had been arrested and that he had participated in a revolutionary alliance organization. He left Suzhou for Zhenjiang on the 13th on official business.

Editorial

### The Future of the British Labour Cabinet

The British county council elections were held throughout the country last week. Although the final results have not yet been announced, according to preliminary vote counts, the Conservative Party has already won 344 seats, while the Labour Party has only won 68 seats. This has forced the Labour Party authorities to admit that they have encountered a serious setback in this election. The Labour Party's official newspaper, "Daily Herald," published a commentary specifically to alert the Labour Party to this failure, saying, "It would be a great mistake to ignore last week's failure." Anyone who deeply understands British party politics believes that the results of the national county council elections serve as a barometer for the next British parliamentary election. Therefore, the British Labour Party, which has been in power for four years, is now facing another serious test.

The British Labour Party has been focusing on domestic socialization construction for the past four years. It cannot be said that it has achieved remarkable success in domestic affairs. In particular, the spirit of hard work of the Labour Party leaders is most worthy of admiration. Although the Labour Party has now suffered a failure in the national county council elections due to other reasons, the Labour Party leaders are still continuing their efforts to try to win back the lost popular support. According to a United Press dispatch from London on the 12th, the National Executive Committee of the British Labour Party has drafted a fighting social reform plan, advocating the intensification of state-owned industries and economic design on a permanent basis. Sugar refining, cement, industrial insurance, meat wholesaling, and local tap water supplies should all be nationalized. In the Labour Party's statement of reasons, it put forward a most beautiful, most novel, and most moving slogan, which is "We will seek freedom from the material constraints and servitude of capitalism." This is indeed a slogan that every British person loves to hear.

However, this plan still needs to be discussed at the Labour Party Congress in June this year and can only be implemented after it is approved by the Congress. Currently, it can only be regarded as a new check from the British Labour Party, and whether it can be cashed in the future is still a question. In fact, even if this plan becomes a reality and makes the lives of the British people more rational and more socialized, it may still be difficult to reverse the Labour Party's downward trend. To be honest, the Labour Party's achievements in domestic affairs during its four years in power are unmatched by any normal cabinet. However, the Labour Party is now suddenly on the decline, and the reason for this lies not in domestic affairs, but in its foreign policy.

On the eve of the 1945 British general election, although World War II had not yet ended, the bloody curtain in Europe had fallen. The Labour Party was already 80 to 90 percent confident of winning the first election after the war and had internally designated Bevin as Foreign Secretary to decide on Britain's new foreign policy. However, Bevin suddenly chanted the slogan of "supra-party line" and his diplomatic actions were almost no different from those of the Conservative Party. He did not sympathize with the Indonesian struggle against the Dutch during the Dutch-Indonesian conflict, but instead supported the Netherlands, which was invading Indonesia. On the Greek issue, he did not support the enlightened and progressive democratic parties, but instead supported the backward Greek royal family. In all the meetings of the United Nations, the British representative had no unique views and completely followed the lead of the American representative. On the German and Japanese issues, Britain also followed the United States. The United States advocated the conclusion of the Atlantic Treaty, and Britain not only did not hesitate but actively tried to woo other countries to participate, and regardless of the people's living burden, put forward a huge financial budget, making every British person feel the threat of "guns before butter." All of this ran counter to the wishes of the British people. What the British people seek today is nothing more than world peace. They see the world situation very clearly and unanimously believe that only in an atmosphere of international peace can Britain overcome its material difficulties and embark on the road to prosperity. Therefore, in the four years since the war, when British Labour Party leaders reported on foreign policy in the House of Commons, they often saw applause from the opposition, while the enlightened members of the Labour Party instead responded with boos. This is truly a strange phenomenon unprecedented in the British Parliament.

The social policies implemented by the British Labour Party not only have lofty ideals but are also the most practical and easy to implement. The socialism implemented by the Soviet government is essentially the same, with no major differences. From this point of view, the improvement of Anglo-Soviet relations is not only easier than with any other country but also the most promising. The world also places high hopes on British Labour Party's diplomacy, hoping that Britain will take a middle ground, act as a bridge between the US and the Soviet Union, and restore the world, which has been divided into two poles, to unity. However, in the four years since then, not only has the "bridge dream" become a thing of the past, but Britain has also regarded the Soviet Union as an enemy. The other day, British Prime Minister Attlee gave a speech, accusing the Soviet Union of being responsible for the division of the world, and said that the Atlantic Treaty was not aggressive but defensive. No matter how Attlee explains it, from the standpoint of the British Labour Party, it is always incompatible with its domestic policy. This is the contradiction between the Labour Party's domestic and foreign policies, and it is also the focus of the Labour Party's loss of faith among voters. Looking ahead to the 1950 general election, the Labour Party's future is very bleak.

However, on today's British party political stage, the Liberal Party has declined and is no longer considered a major player. Only the Labour Party and the Conservative Party are taking turns holding power. Logically speaking, if the British people are disappointed with the Labour Party, they can only choose the Conservative Party. But in reality, can the Conservative Party's domestic and foreign policies be better than those of the Labour Party? The eyes of the British people are discerning. The Labour Party's failure in the national county council elections is not so much a prelude to the Conservative Party's regaining power as it is a warning given to the Labour Party by the British people. If the Labour Party can be particularly vigilant about this and work harder in the future, it is too early to say what the outcome of the 1950 general election will be.

This is the first public expression of support from the people under the Soviet government for the struggle of the Chinese Communist Party after the CCP took control of North China, and it is also a harbinger of the Soviet Union's imminent clear support for the CCP's actions. Therefore, the general public attaches great importance to this. Last night, the CCP radio station broadcast the full text of the telegram. The telegram specified that the Soviet youth are extremely concerned about the heroic struggle of the Chinese Communist Party and youth for freedom, democracy, and independence, and expressed "heartfelt respect." It also stated: The victory of this struggle is also the victory of the world's democratic and progressive camp, and it is an extremely important contribution to the common cause of striving for world peace and opposing the instigators of new imperialist wars.

### The Establishment of West Germany is Imminent, Allied Countries Urge Speedy Formulation of a Charter, Assist German Economy to be Self-Sufficient and Decide to Reduce Dismantling of German Industrial Equipment

[Reuters, Bonn, 12th] Liaison officers of the British and American parliamentary committee (constituent assembly) stationed in West Germany urgently notified the meeting today, stating that due to the tightening of the world political situation, the establishment of West Germany is imminent. The notice also blamed German political parties for nitpicking every clause of the draft West German constitution. The constitutional work has come to a standstill since the German Social Democratic Party criticized the content of the draft constitution yesterday as being impossible to implement. German officials here believe that the Western Allies' urging is due to the fear that the Soviet authorities are preparing to lift the Berlin blockade, so that the Western occupying countries have to agree to the four powers to re-discuss the solution to the entire German problem. The Germans also said that since Britain, the United States, and France formed an agreement on West Germany in Washington, the Soviet Union has been actively preparing to take new actions to prevent the establishment of the West German government. Therefore, if the Soviet Union lifts the Berlin blockade, according to the gentleman's agreement in the United Nations Security Council last year, both countries cannot refuse to participate in the four-power discussion to seek a solution to the entire German problem.

[United Press, Bonn, 13th] Responsible officials said today that the United States, Britain, and France are drafting a plan to separate West Berlin and set up its own parliament. This plan is equivalent to establishing a second government in Germany. The West German government will be established within this year, and the East German government plan will also be announced.

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The United States, Britain, and France will announce today a reduction in the number of German compensation factories to be dismantled. This is a further step for the Allied countries to help the German economy become self-sufficient. It is reported that the United States initially proposed reducing the number of dismantled factories by 167, and finally agreed with Britain and France to retain 150 to 160 German factories. The list of dismantled factories lists a total of 2,000 wartime factories, and hundreds have been dismantled in the past three years. The proposal to reduce the dismantling of factories was put forward by Hoffman, Director of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, with the aim of making German industry contribute to European reconstruction. France opposed this proposal most strongly, fearing the revival of the German military industry. The recent establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty has increased France's sense of security, and the main reason for the establishment of the three-country agreement is probably this.

### Indonesia-Netherlands Dispute and the Ming Zhen谛 Case, Included in the Agenda of the United Nations General Assembly, Indian and Pakistani Representatives Fully Support Indonesia

[United Press, Flushing, 12th] This afternoon, the United Nations General Assembly voted by 41 to 3 to include this 20-month-old Indonesian dispute in the agenda. The Netherlands only received the support of Belgium and South Africa, and 12 countries abstained. According to the United Nations Charter, the General Assembly has the right to discuss this dispute, which concerns the transfer of sovereignty of the East Indies from the Hague government to the Netherlands-Indonesian Federation, including the Republic of Indonesia.

Indian representative Shi David recalled that India initially suggested including the Indonesian issue in the agenda. He emphasized that the people and peace of Asia are related to this. He also said that it should not be easily forgotten that 19 member states of the United Nations met in New Delhi to discuss the Indonesian issue. He said that the United Nations undoubtedly has the right to take action on this matter. He went on to say that the discussion of the General Assembly will help the negotiations between the Netherlands and Indonesia. (Under the auspices of the Indonesian Commission, the Netherlands-Indonesian talks will begin in Batavia on the 13th.)

After the investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office was completed, he was indicted for manslaughter.

Fourteen male and female suspects arrested in the case of the death of an inspector from the Zhabei police station

[Our Own Report] Wang Jie, an inspector at the Zhabei police station, led police patrols in his jurisdiction at 3 AM on the morning of the 8th. On the way, they encountered robbers and were arrested by the robbers. As a result, Inspector Wang was shot in the chest and abdomen, and died on the spot. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Afterwards, in addition to personally attending the funeral, Director Mao ordered all police stations to strictly arrest the robbers who fled the scene and bring them to justice for investigation. It is now known that the branch director of the police station, Zhang, ordered the criminal section chief Jiang Ying to lead all criminal police officers to search and arrest the suspects, and Inspector Wang Shusheng investigated day and night, and went to Suzhou, Pudong and other places to pursue and arrest them. Finally, after days of arrest, fourteen suspects related to the case were arrested, including Xia Yifei, Liang Shouhong, Ma Chonggui, Qiu Rufa, Zhou Zhede, Luo Wenxiang, Qiu Yichen, Gu Jinxiang, Fang Xiaosanzi, Sang Yiyi, Pei Shilai, and women Bian Mao, Tao Zhu, and Tang Xue. Four box guns and one handgun were confiscated. Due to the serious suspicion, they are being rigorously investigated. An application for extension of detention was submitted to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday morning, and they will be transferred to the Garrison Command for investigation after the investigation is completed.

### 市府平衡財政收支　計劃大綱擬訂完成　整理舊稅決定四項原則

The Municipal Government's outline of the plan to balance financial revenue and expenditure is completed; four principles are determined for organizing old taxes

[Our Own Report] After Secretary-General Chen of the Municipal Government took office, he faced the most difficult financial crisis in the city. Therefore, he paid special attention to financial issues. In addition to personally handling financial cases day and night, he also instructed the Finance Bureau to quickly draft measures to raise funds for the city to provide for expenditures. After receiving the order, the Finance Bureau did not abandon the drafting of these measures despite the tense situation of continuously raising funds and cash. It recently completed a detailed "Outline of the Plan to Balance Financial Revenue and Expenditure in This City." Yesterday morning at 9 AM, it convened relevant agencies such as the Land Administration Bureau, the Public Utilities Bureau, the Accounting Office, and the Municipal Bank to discuss it together. Regarding the "organization of old taxes," four principles were determined: (1) For all tax revenues levied ad valorem, a strict inspection system should be established to effectively collect taxes. (2) For all fixed taxes, they should be converted to mobile taxes as much as possible. (3) For those adjusted according to the index, the original base number should be reasonably increased. (4) There are also very detailed improvement plans for other technical aspects such as collection, payment, transfer, and disbursement.

財政困難已達極點

Financial difficulties have reached an extreme point

After the meeting, the reporter interviewed Qian Jianfu, the acting director of the Finance Bureau. Except for the issue of whether to open up new tax sources, which should be carefully considered, and that the specific measures in the organization of old taxes cannot be announced at this time, he reported the following situation regarding the current financial difficulties and the difficulty of fund management: The current financial difficulties can be said to have reached an extreme point. Reports indicate that the central government is also unable to continue printing money. The financial plight of local governments is self-evident. Moreover, financial reorganization values the stability of the financial order and the establishment of the financial system. Even if there are still some old taxes that can be reorganized, they cannot be implemented without being passed by the public opinion organs. Therefore, it is still of no help in the face of urgent needs. In the current economic situation, where things are changing rapidly and the currency is accelerating its depreciation, it is even more difficult to cope with unpredictable expenditures with limited income. What's more, after formulating a plan, from the time it is reviewed and passed, implemented and collected, to the time the tax is paid, a certain amount of time must pass. During this time, the price situation has already risen sharply. For example, the housing donation is criticized because the donation amount is too low, and even letters are sent to the bureau to scold it. However, it is not easy to adjust, and it cannot be done overnight.

今後局勢愈趨艱危

The situation will become increasingly difficult in the future

The reporter further asked that the taxes levied ad valorem and adjusted according to the index should be able to match expenditures without any problems. Acting Director Qian replied that regardless of whether the tax is levied ad valorem or adjusted according to the index, the date of deposit in the treasury is fixed, and the index on which the tax revenue is based mostly belongs to the previous period (because in fact it is absolutely impossible to collect and collect immediately according to the current index), and the expenditure is based on the price at the time of payment. There must be a considerable distance between the two, so the deficit difference cannot be avoided. For example, in addition to the fact that the public service salaries must be supplemented at the beginning of the month according to the index announced at the end of the month, they must also be pre-issued according to this standard, and the amount of the two is very large. However, no matter how much tax is collected in the few days at the end of the month and the beginning of the month, it is not enough to cope with the expenditure. What's more, the current financial problem is not only about how to adapt income and expenditure, which is the most urgent task, but also how to raise cash is an important issue, because whether or not cash is issued is closely related to the welfare of colleagues. In the eyes of colleagues, the total income is still a drop in the bucket, but those in charge of this matter have exhausted their infinite strength. The situation will become increasingly difficult in the future. In these extraordinary times, we should devote ourselves to it, and hope that the formal director will be published as soon as possible, so that we can find ideal ways to solve this difficulty.

市府定期召開咨詢委員會議

The Municipal Government will convene regular meetings of the Advisory Committee

[Our Own Report] The Municipal Government will convene a regular meeting of the Municipal Government Advisory Committee at 4 PM on the 20th of this month.

Chen Liang, the secretary-general of the Municipal Government, visited Dr. Yan Huiqing, the chairman of the committee, yesterday to discuss administrative issues related to this city.

### Disbursement of Relief Funds Causes Dispute: Feng Yun Files a Private Prosecution, Accusing Liu Zhe of Defamation

[Our Report] Feng Yun, a Legislative Yuan member from the Northeast, has filed a private prosecution with the local court against Liu Zhe, the Vice President of the Control Yuan, under Article 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, engaging lawyer Zhang Yupeng. This stems from a dispute arising from the disbursement of relief funds to refugees from the Northeast in Shanghai by the Northeast Retained Inside-the-Pass Materials Clearing and Handling Committee in February of this year. Afterwards, on February 14th in Beijing, Liu Zhe spoke to the press, claiming that Feng Yun, on the 7th of that month, at the office of the Superintendent of the Huangpu Police Sub-Bureau in Shanghai, threatened Mo Dehui with a gun, forcibly demanded a Central Bank check for 20 million yuan, and only left after forcing Mo to accompany him to cash it, portraying Feng Yun's actions in broad daylight as akin to banditry and kidnapping. These accusations are purely fictitious, as already formally denied by Zhang Weiren, the Chief of the Supervisory Office of the Shanghai Police Bureau, who stated, "The arrival of Mo and Liu at the Supervisory Office was of their own volition, accompanied by more than ten gentlemen including Dalian Mayor Zhao Ximeng and National Representative Zhao Jinbi, which clearly proves that the alleged kidnapping is entirely false." Furthermore, Feng Yun's participation in assisting with the distribution of refugee relief funds was at the invitation of Mo and Liu, and given Feng Yun's personal standing, such crude behavior would be entirely out of character. Liu, as Vice President of the Control Yuan, has unjustly slandered Feng Yun, hence the request for lawyer Zhang Yupeng to file a private prosecution with the local court, accusing Liu of defamation and seeking a judgment ordering him to publish an apology and correction in the newspaper. Feng's complaint was delivered to the local court yesterday morning. Feng Yun is currently in Taiwan, and if he has not returned to Shanghai by the time of the hearing, he will have lawyer Zhang represent him in court. The local court has indicated that it will proceed with the trial according to the law in the near future. The summons for the defendant will be sent directly to the Control Yuan in Nanjing for delivery.

### Housing Dispute Involves Military Personnel: Summons Returned, Refusal to Appear in Court

[Our Report] Shan Shirong and Jin Lilin are subtenants of Huang Shiliang. The two parties have long been at odds due to rental disputes. On March 7th of this year, Shan and Jin wanted to sublet their rented room upstairs at No. 13, Lane 96, Jianguo West Road, to a Mr. Feng. Fearing Huang's disapproval, they invited Wang Da, Zhang Jinhua, Yao Tianfu, Wu Yisheng, and Wang Dechang, personnel from the Shanghai Civilian Self-Defense Headquarters, to help them forcibly move in at around 7 PM that afternoon, leading to a conflict with Huang. Shan and Jin incited Wang and the other four to beat Huang, causing injuries. Huang reported the incident to the police bureau, which transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. On the 5th of this month, the local court issued summonses. Wang and the others had their adjutant at the Headquarters receive them. Yesterday morning, judge Ou Shenghe of the local court held a hearing. Wang and the others, using their military status, instructed someone to return the summonses, claiming they could not attend due to official duties. The court expressed great anger at this, immediately stating that every citizen has an obligation to respond to a court summons, and ordered them not to resist the summons next time.

### New Pharmaceutical Industry Submits Requests to Competent Authorities: Do Not Stipulate Drug Import Ratios; Approve Direct Ordering from Foreign Countries

[Our Report] The Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association believes that due to the large variety of drugs, import ratios should not be stipulated, and that drug imports should be directly ordered by the new pharmaceutical industry, without requiring importers to handle the orders, in order to meet needs effectively. It has recently submitted separate requests to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Import Control Committee, and other relevant competent authorities, requesting that they adopt this approach.

According to industry leaders speaking to our reporter: the stipulated drug import ratios, particularly severe restrictions on prepared medicines, have led to an oversupply of raw materials in the city, with prices falling below foreign procurement costs. Furthermore, most of China's pharmaceutical industry is only capable of processing and packaging, not actual manufacturing. Therefore, Chinese people can only find ways to acquire well-known prepared medicines through roundabout means, resulting in large-scale smuggling. Smuggled supplies account for 80% of the demand for well-known prepared medicines. This not only fails to conserve foreign exchange but also results in the loss of national tax revenue. Moreover, the allocation and procurement of medicines require specialized knowledge and experience. The drug types and quantities arranged by importers do not meet actual needs, and their high prices, plus commissions, further increase the cost of imported goods. Therefore, they hope that regarding import ratios for drugs, whether raw or prepared medicines, the standard should be based on the needs of the time, and fixed ratios should not be imposed. At the same time, drug imports should be directly ordered by the new pharmaceutical industry from foreign manufacturers or their management offices. As the government revises import control regulations to supplement the financial and economic reform plan, they are laying out the true situation for reference and adoption.

### Gold Yuan Notes Disappear from Border Provinces and Counties: Postal Services Unable to Maintain Operations; Report Submitted to Ministry of Communications Requesting Instructions

[Our Report] The situation of people in various border provinces and regions refusing to use Gold Yuan notes has become increasingly widespread. According to a spokesperson for the Directorate General of Posts, the Directorate General has been receiving letters and telegrams from postal bureaus in various regions reporting on the local currency situation. In remote areas, Gold Yuan notes have disappeared entirely, but postal bureaus still use Gold Yuan notes as the medium of exchange, making it impossible to maintain operations, disrupting postal routes, and causing severe hardship for employees. Summarizing the content of letters and telegrams from various locations, the main points are as follows: In areas such as Luoding, Yangchun, Xinxing, Anpu, Xuwen, Xinfeng, and Chunwan in the Guangdong region, all transactions are based on Hong Kong dollars, silver dollars, or grain. Small amounts are denominated in "Guang Hao" (Guangdong fractional currency). Merchants in Xinfeng and other places are even using grain to purchase postage stamps, which the postal bureaus are struggling to handle. In areas such as Rongjiang, Shuicheng, Weining, Sandu in the Guizhou region and counties bordering Yunnan and Guangxi, silver dollars, Guang Hao, and Yunnan-made half silver dollars are the basic currency. In places such as Mojiang in Yunnan, Gold Yuan notes are also refused, and "half coins" are used. The area around Hekou even uses Vietnamese currency as the base currency. The situation in Guangxi is largely similar to that in Guangdong. In Jiangxi, Shicheng, Ruijin, Xingguo, Huichang, Poyang, Yugan, as well as Hunan, Gan, Ning, and Qing, Gold Yuan notes have also been rejected, and silver dollars are universally used. People are requesting hard currency for mailing letters and packages. However, government financial authorities have not yet established an exchange rate between silver dollars and Gold Yuan notes, leaving postal bureaus unable to comply. Furthermore, if postal bureaus continue to use Gold Yuan notes as the sole currency for postage payments, the revenue of postal bureaus will still be in Gold Yuan notes, making it difficult to sustain the livelihoods of postal employees in those regions, which is also a thorny issue. The Directorate General of Posts has already reported the above situation truthfully to the Ministry of Communications, requesting instructions on how to resolve the situation.

### China Bank Jeep Accident Case: Civil Portion Heard Yesterday

Negotiation Elder Lawyer Jiang Yong Attracts Attention with Court Appearance

[Our Report] Qian Maosheng, a driver for the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China, drove a medium-sized jeep owned by the bank, number 03-9280, on Nanjing Road at around 10 AM on May 24th last year. Due to overtaking a vehicle in front, he hit Yang Zhonghe, an employee of the Bureau of Materials of the Two Railways, crushing Yang's ankle and damaging his leather shoes and trousers. The police bureau transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. Before August 19th last year, the local court sentenced Qian to a fine of 100 million legal tender. As for the attached civil suit, Yang demanded compensation for spiritual and material damages of 464.28 million legal tender, equivalent to the price of 80 shi of white rice at the time, and listed Xu Weiming, the legal representative of the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China, as the second defendant. The case was heard by the Immigration Court until yesterday, when judge He Xianzhang held a hearing. Qian testified about the incident, claiming that Yang himself was careless and was hit by the car. Xu did not appear, but was represented by negotiation elder lawyer Jiang Yong, who has not been seen in court for a long time, attracting much attention. As Yang himself also failed to appear in court, and since so much time has passed and the currency system has been reformed, the court ordered that the case be adjourned for further hearing to determine if Yang had any changes to the amount of claim. Jiang then left in a hurry.

### Comfort Mission Visits Wounded Naval Officers and Soldiers Yesterday

### Jiaotong University Student Union Organizes School Protection Team

[Our Report] Following Fudan University's establishment of a protection team, Jiaotong University students also believe that the changing situation requires the school to take proactive measures and have been demanding the speedy establishment of a security team to protect the campus. In addition to the fire and rescue brigade, which is still in the planning stages, the student union has established a rather large School Protection Team. Currently, participation is voluntary, but when necessary, everyone will have an obligation to protect the school. The School Protection Team is initially set to consist of five students from the same dormitory or class, forming a security squad. Six squads will form a company, and a brigade will be formed based on the principle of establishing a first-level unit. From 11 PM to 5 AM every night, they will be divided into two shifts for patrols. Each shift will be on duty for three hours, with one shift from 11 PM to 2 AM and the other from 2 AM to 5 AM. The organizational system will be based on having the emergency response committee be responsible for organizing the headquarters of the School Protection Team, under which will be general affairs, security, fire, and rescue teams. A mobile brigade will be established when necessary.

### Jiujiang Struggles in a Dead Corner

— Our Reporter Liu Zao

[Our Report from Jiujiang, 10th] Jiujiang is now a declining market trapped in a dead corner. The bustling scene of people weaving back and forth on the riverbank and in the streets and alleys, which was common almost two years ago, is hard to find in Jiujiang today. On the contrary, people running through the streets and alleys are frowning, fearing the years ahead, unsure how they will make it through. Therefore, Jiujiang is struggling in a dead corner!

Jiujiang is said to have a population of 100,000, but now it probably has, at most, half that number. According to somewhat inaccurate surveys and statistics, there are fewer than 2,000 shops in the urban area. Before the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was built, it bore the heavy responsibility of handling the import and export of Jiangxi's goods. Therefore, the transportation industry, especially the transshipment industry, was a major industry in the Jiujiang market. All of Jiangxi's local products, such as porcelain, tea, and grain, were exported from here, and daily necessities such as cloth, general merchandise, and salt were imported from here. Therefore, Jiujiang had a golden age before the war. Even at the time of victory and until this time last year, although it could not compare to the past, the prosperity of the market was still maintained.

Now, major industries here, such as porcelain and grain, are declining in the export market due to the overall economic downturn. Especially after the Xuzhou-Huaihai Campaign and the start of the Anqing battle, in the most recent stage, it has climbed to the very tip of the dead corner.

The porcelain industry in Jiujiang had more than a hundred businesses before the war, concentrated in the bustling markets of Binjiang Road and Dazhong Road. When they were reinstated after the war, owing to the docking of ships going east and the brisk sales in the southeastern market, porcelain merchants spent their days smiling. So, the Jiujiang porcelain industry was still comprised of more than 90 firms when the war was over. In addition to running retail businesses, they also did export to Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou. The current situation, however, has plummeted. More than half of the 90-plus porcelain merchants have closed down due to sluggish business.

On the way to Anqing, there were several encounters with Communist troops. The Da Yu wheel of Dada Company departed from Shanghai on March 27th, arrived in Nanjing on the 29th, sailed north on the morning of the 30th, and at 2 PM on the 31st, while passing through the Taiziji area downstream of Anqing, Communist troops on the north bank spotted the ship and opened fire. A passenger named Wang Wei Shulan was injured and died. While passing through Wulidun near Anqing, due to the shallow water on the river, the ship had to sail close to the north bank. During the voyage, it was subjected to intensive gun and artillery fire from Communist troops. Two hawkers, Luo Jiqing and Hong Laichu, were injured. On the 2nd, when sailing up from Anqing, through Guanzhou, Huayang, and other places, although Communist troops on the north bank also occasionally fired cold shots, the ship was able to hide its target more easily due to the rain and fog. When the ship arrived in Jiujiang on the morning of the 3rd, it was discovered that, in addition to Wang Wei Shulan, who was killed by a bullet during the attack, peddlers Feng Jiqing and Hong Laichu were wounded in the left cheek and left hand by artillery fire. Fortunately, there were no other casualties. Luo and Hong are now receiving medical treatment in Xun. The ship was hit by artillery fire in seven places, as large as rice bowls and as small as teacups. On the top three levels, second class, it is just a gasping for breath, fighting there before death. The price of a bucket of lace-edged rice bowls from a shop last year at this time was about two silver dollars. Today, it is being sold on the ground for only forty and a half cents, and if you really want to buy it, they will voluntarily reduce the price to make ends meet. The Jiujiang Porcelain Factory, run by Jiangxi Xingye Company, also closed down due to the black tide of market decline.

In terms of the shipping industry, Jiujiang is still divided into two groups: the Yangtze River and the inland rivers. The foreign ships of China Merchants and Sanbei belong to the Yangtze River Shipping Association. Ships traveling on the Gan River, Poyang Lake, and Wuxue, Hukou, and Pengze belong to the Inland River Industry Association. All Yangtze River liners, such as China Merchants and Sanjiang, as well as the Taikoo in the past, used Jiujiang as a stopover when going east or west. Since the Anqing war broke out in March of this year, the Communist troops have forced approaching units on the riverbanks, such as Huayang and Wangjiang. The vessels that have passed have been attacked by Communist troops one after another, including Da Qing, Jiang Shun, and the recently risky voyage west from Shanghai by Da Yu. The bulkheads are covered with bullet holes, and bullets penetrated from the north side and exited from the south side. The steering wheel rope and the iron-clad pipe also suffered artillery hits and were pierced.

Amongst the ships currently berthed in Jiujiang, are the China Merchants Bureau's Hai Yong, the Sanbei Company's De An, and the Shanghai Industrial Company's Hu Han. They can neither return east nor go west, because while there is no danger on the Xun-Han section, cargo transportation is scarce, almost non-existent. A large ship cannot cover its operating costs relying solely on the small revenue from passenger transport. Therefore, they have no choice but to rest here temporarily.

Although the Nanchang-Jiujiang section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway extending to the head of the Xunyang River can increase the prosperity of the Jiujiang market, it is a pity that Jiujiang, which has declined drastically today, cannot accept the benefits of this railway because the market is depressed, financing is depleted, and businessmen have no power to develop abroad.

Currently, the entire income of the Nanchang-Jiujiang section cannot even maintain the line's regular expenditures. The person in charge of the Xunyang office of the railway is himself going to Hangzhou to seek solutions from the bureau due to the disparity between income and expenditure. In the current war-torn north of Jiangxi, apart from a few passengers who buy tickets according to the regulations, firewood, rice, fish, and charcoal from various stations along the Nanchang-Jiujiang line are crammed into the train cars by special interest single-load traders. Strangely, ticket inspectors on the line not only treat the single-load traders with "not bothering is normal," but even give passengers who buy tickets the preferential treatment of "no ticket inspection." How can the railway bureau not lose money and even "collapse" under this abnormal phenomenon? (Sent from the Garden Hotel.)

### Jurong's Construction

— Our Correspondent Liu Ya-fu

[Our Jurong Dispatch, 9th] Since the county government completed 381 kilometers of rural power grids, it has been dedicated to public works construction. To understand the general situation, our reporter interviewed Chen Wanrui, the section chief in charge. The explanation was as follows:

There are three planned or urgently repaired routes:

(1) Jingli (Shui) Highway: The section of the highway from Nanjing to Hushu was opened to traffic earlier, but the section from Hushu through Guozhuang Temple in Jurong County to Lishui has not yet been opened. The No. 9 bridge in Guozhuang Temple was destroyed during the Anti-Japanese War and has not been rebuilt. Now, in conjunction with Jiangning and Lishui counties, a budget is being prepared for construction.

(2) Jurong (Yang) Highway: Tianjian Long-Distance Bus Company used to operate on this road. At that time, the Huangtu Bridge in the county was washed away by summer floods. This spring, the township authorities where the bridge is located mobilized civilians, together with the engineering battalion of the Xiongfeng Troops stationed in the county, to complete the repair, and it is now open to traffic.

(3) Jiangfang Highway: The project is the largest, with thousands of civilians working daily. Construction started in mid-May and was completed on the 8th of this month. It is divided into two sections:

1 From Longtan around Yingfangkou to Xiashu; 2 From Longtan along the Jinghu Railway, parallel and extending eastward, passing Cangtou, Xiashu, to Qiaotou. Regarding section 1, from Longtan to Sanjiangkou, the road is 5 meters wide and paved with cinder, passable in both sunny and rainy weather. From Sanjiangkou through Yingfangkou to Xiashu, the road is 4 to 5 meters wide and is an earth road, passable in sunny weather but blocked by rain, which is very inconvenient. Work is currently being accelerated to add cinder.

3 The middle section of the Jingzhen (Jiang) Highway is approximately 18.5 kilometers long. Thousands of civilians worked daily for more than half a month, and the project was completed on the 8th of this month. Regarding the emergency repair of this section, it is further divided into three subsections:

(A) From east of Longtan to the cement factory, there is an existing stone road, 5 meters wide, which is intact and does not need to be repaired. East of the cement factory, it is close to Qinglong Mountain, Laohu Mountain, Dongxi Mayao Mountain, etc. From the north side of the mountain to the mountain water ditch embankment to Shiliuyuan is about 3 kilometers. Because the south side of the road is a mountain water ditch embankment, it cannot be completely removed. The north side of the road is 1.5 to 2.5 meters of low-lying waterlogged fields, which are not easy to widen. Civilians were ordered to excavate half of the high embankment on the south side to widen the roadbed. However, after the repair, it is only 3 to 4 meters wide, which is only enough for one vehicle to pass at a time. In order to remedy this, two passing bays were added to allow oncoming vehicles to pass. Past Shiliuyuan, there is Huangni Mountain, about 0.5 kilometers long. The original Jinghu Railway passed through this mountain, and the width inside only accommodated the railway. If this highway were to be widened by passing straight through, the project would be huge, and it would be beyond the power of the civilians. Therefore, it was detoured around the edge of Huangni Mountain in a U-shape, about 2 kilometers long and 4 meters wide. The road surface is paved with cobblestones and is passable in both sunny and rainy weather.

(B) South of the Huangni Mountain East Railway, passing Xin'an Temple, Qianyao, Xicun, to the west end of Cangtou Street, it is repaired approximately 6 meters wide. Cangtou Street is approximately 1 kilometer long, and the road is approximately 3 meters wide. Crossing Cangtou Street, passing Xiashu to Daigongshan's mouth, is repaired according to 6 meters. The stones have not been laid, but it is already open to traffic.

(C) From the east side of Daigongshan's mouth to the west end of Qiaotou Town is approximately 2 kilometers long. The original roadbed was 5 meters wide, and there were vehicles transporting mud and sand from the west end of the town around the north of the town to the station, a section of approximately 0.2 kilometers, which was only 3.5 meters wide. The south side of the road is a pond, and the north side is a mountain water river. The base is 3 meters high and has been repaired and widened to 5 meters. East of the station to the west end of Tandu Town in Zhenjiang is approximately 1.5 kilometers long. The original roadbed was 5 meters wide and has been restored to a smooth and passable condition. The bridges along the road, about ten, were also built by the local township offices requisitioning folk trees. However, they can only carry 4 tons. In addition, all parts that have not been paved with cinder and stones are also requisitioning cement factory transport vehicles to speed up the transport and paving of cinder and stones so that they can be passable in both sunny and rainy weather.

National Delegates Yu Jingyi and Others Request the Release of Xia Bengying

[Nanjing, 12th] National Delegates Yu Jingyi, Xie Linshu, and 35 others, due to the fact that National Delegate Xia Bengying has been deprived of her freedom for more than two months, which has not only severely impacted her mental state but also greatly affected her physical health, specially submitted a request to Acting President Li on the 12th, requesting that he immediately order the detaining authorities to restore Delegate Xia's freedom. Assuming that Delegate Xia has serious suspicions of violating the law and there is concrete evidence, she should also be handed over to the court for public trial in accordance with the law to ensure fairness and prevent letting criminals go unpunished.

Jiaxing Rebel Soldiers' Trick: Section Chief Yan Kidnapped

[Wuxing, 11th] Zhang Ziqing and 133 other students of the Jiaxing Army Reserve Officer Training Corps were persuaded by personnel dispatched by the county's security authorities to various townships, and they returned under amnesty.

Section Chief Yan waved his hand to indicate his intention to recruit them. Upon approaching to speak, he was kidnapped. Also: Regarding the reason for the mutiny of the Jiaxing Army Reserve Officer Training Corps, student Zhang Ziqing told reporters: "The commander of this corps, Jia Yibin, due to (1) the current situation, believes that this move is a beneficial action, (2) the lack of attention from the authorities to the merits of training domestic middle school and university students at the end of the Anti-Japanese War, (3) personnel friction between Jia's faction cadres and staff school cadres, as well as the assignment of officials from the reserve officer training corps, (4) Jia's ideals for building an army cannot be realized, so he was indignant and did this."

[Another dispatch] The mutinous troops stationed in He retreated to the highest peak, Yangwu Mountain, on the 11th, and stubbornly resisted the danger.

### Sichuan Specialty: White Wax

— Our Correspondent Zhou Xueduan

[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 10th via airmail] White wax is a unique specialty of Sichuan Province. From the Beginning of Spring to Qingming, these days are when wax merchants enter the mountains to purchase wax insects. On the roads of Sichuan and Kang, merchants in teams travel incessantly, bringing silk, cloth, and paper to transport wax insects back and forth, hanging them on wax trees. After autumn, they are harvested, processed, and refined, and transported outside the province, thereby filling the trade deficit in Sichuan and stabilizing the balance of the entire land of abundance.

Wax Insect Collection and Transportation

White wax is secreted by wax insects on wax trees and is made by cooking and refining. Common wax trees include white wax trees, water wax trees, and Ligustrum lucidum. In the production areas of Sichuan and Kang, those distributed in the Anning River Basin of Xisheng (the western part of Sichuan Province), such as the Huili area, are called "Dashan Insects" – mountain insects. Those produced in the Leshan, Emei, and Guanxian areas of western Sichuan are called "Ba Insects." Mountain insects are used for breeding, while Ba insects are only used for collecting wax. Every year after the Beginning of Spring, general "insect merchants" who specialize in purchasing insects enter the mountains in groups to participate in the "Insect Meetings" of various mountains and negotiate prices with the "Insect Owners," and then go to the mountains together to pick insects. The method is to hire pickers to climb the trees and use bamboo fences lined with paper to hold them. Each load is 60 jin, and the price is calculated by the load. After the transaction, they rush back to their original place to resell or extract wax.

Extraction and Refining Methods

The method of extracting wax is to wrap wax insects in vegetable leaves and hang them on wax trees. After the wax insects hatch, they absorb the nutrients of the tree branches and eat their young buds. After the summer solstice, they secrete a white substance that solidifies all over the tree. After the Beginning of Autumn, wax extractors carry the wax down, put it in steamers for cooking and refining to melt it. Only leaves and impurities remain on the steamer, and the wax settles in the pot. Then, it is taken out and placed in a wooden basin. This is the first time the white wax is refined, called "Yazi." After further refining, it becomes pure wax. There is also yellow wax, which is the honeycomb of domestic or wild bees. After the honey is extracted, it is made by dissolving it in boiling water. It is produced in various parts of Sichuan, with Guangyuan Zhongba being the most famous.

Production and Uses

During its peak period, Sichuan Province produced 150,000 dan of white wax annually, which was sold throughout the country, with Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hankou being the main markets. It was also sold abroad to areas such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Nanyang, with an annual amount of over 10,000 dan (over 40,000 kilograms of yellow wax annually). Its quality and abundance of production are unmatched in the country. It has a wide range of uses. In industry, it can be used to make candles. In medicine, it is used to make the shells of pills and various models. This is one of Sichuan's main export specialties. The collection, transportation, and refining are arduous. The mountain roads are rugged, and the roads are not peaceful. This year, there have been frequent reports of deaths and injuries among insect merchants. It is because of this accumulated sweat and blood that Sichuan's export prosperity has been created today.

### Currency Reform Suppresses Rent and Devalues, Lease Expires and Refuses to Move Out - Lawyer Jiang Pingfan Answers

Li Yongkang asks: My friend Zhao rented two self-built bungalows to Gao in the 35th year of the Republic of China. Gao asked a guarantor to provide a guarantee with a neutral party as a witness, stating that from September 1, 35th year of the Republic of China, to September 1, 37th year of the Republic of China, 200,000 yuan of legal tender would be used as a security deposit. No rent would be collected, and no interest would be charged. After the expiration date, the owner would be returned unconditionally, and the 200,000 yuan of legal tender would be recovered. Last year, the lease expired at the time of currency reform, resulting in a dispute. Gao believes that the security deposit should be calculated as 200,000 yuan of gold yuan. May I ask (1) Is this request legally reasonable? (2) How many times should 200,000 yuan of legal tender from September of the 35th year of the Republic of China, to March of the 38th year of the Republic of China, be converted into gold yuan? (3) Can he be asked to move out, and is there a legal basis? (4) If Gao refuses to move, how should I deal with it?

[Answer] (1) According to the contract, it must be established by the consensus of both parties. If the lessor agrees to the conditions put forward by the lessee, it can have legal effect. (2) There is no explicit provision in the law. However, according to the law of circumstances, a request can be made to the court to increase or decrease it. The number of times should be determined by the court after review. (3) A fixed-term lease of two years or less cannot be requested to be vacated on the grounds that the lease has expired. (4) Both parties should jointly discuss how to renew the lease.

### Market Rice Prices Closely Approaching the Five-Dollar Mark, Social Affairs Bureau Orders Suspension of Trading

[Our report] The rice market rose again yesterday, and the price of gold rose, making people's hearts firm. Moreover, the price in the producing area is high, the arrival of goods is scarce, and the supply is not smooth. The South Market initially rose by 20,000 to 30,000, and then rose again by 30,000 to 40,000. The reported price of white japonica and thin indica rice was 450,000 each, an increase of 70,000 (spot). The next day, the price of white japonica was 480,000 and thin indica rice was 490,000. At 10:30 AM, the Social Affairs Bureau ordered the market to close because the rise was too great. The prices in the North Market were chaotic. The reported price of white japonica and thin indica rice was 500,000, and the market closed at 10 AM without any formal transactions.

Another report: Yesterday, the rice price set a new record. The reported price of white japonica rice once reached 500,000. The Social Affairs Bureau believed that the rise in rice prices was alarming and urgently ordered the food market to suspend trading. At this time, the opening price in the South Market was 430,000 to 450,000. After hearing the news, rice merchants, individual buyers, and local gangs from the North Market rushed to the South Market, so the price in the South Market also reached more than 470,000. At 10:30 AM, the Social Affairs Bureau received a report and also ordered the suspension of trading. Whether the food market can be opened smoothly today depends on the trend of foreign prices.

Yesterday, the prices in the rice market were extremely chaotic. The price of white japonica rice was around 500,000, and the retail price at each rice shop was indistinguishable from 520,000 to 540,000.

Another report: Regarding the trading of the food market, after the Social Affairs Bureau ordered the market to close yesterday morning, Cao Peizi, the director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau in charge, made a statement, saying that the daily rise in rice market trading was originally limited to 10%. If this limit is exceeded, trading will be suspended. In the future, grain prices will depend on the Central Bank's sale of gold and the prices in the Wuxi producing area. The Social Affairs Bureau is determined to protect the business of general legitimate merchants. If the government is confident in control, it may handle the public sale of grain, but this is not a fundamental solution. If the government has the ability to come up with a fundamental solution, it can suppress the rise in grain prices. Currently, there is no grain shortage, but the rise in grain prices is too fast, which is very stimulating to people's hearts.

### Edible Oil and Flour Prices Rise

Around 10:00 AM, the Central Bank entrusted Dadecheng Gold Shop to sell 61 large bars at 3.92 million, and the market trend turned soft.

Street trading fluctuated greatly. The morning was stable, with large-head coins still quoted at 82,000 and 87,000. Around 10:00 AM, it was heard that insiders were selling off "boat dollars," and the price per coin rose to 90,000, further strengthening sentiment.

### Financial Management Bureau Issues Order: No Discounting of Banker's Drafts Allowed

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Financial Management Bureau yesterday issued an order to the Shanghai Silver, Money, and Trust Industries Association that the fixed-amount banker's drafts issued by the Central Bank should be regarded as cash in nature and should not be discounted. Furthermore, banker's drafts issued by various banks and firms should be issued at the request of customers and should be payable on sight, and there should be no discounting. However, due to the discovery of counterfeiting of some banks' and firms' banker's drafts, banks and firms must wait until they are presented for exchange before they can pay and use them, resulting in discounting. Therefore, the Bureau specifically ordered the three industries association to quickly seek technical methods to eliminate counterfeiting, comply with the regulations for banks and firms to issue banker's drafts, and naturally eliminate the phenomenon of discounting.

### National Bank Notifies Silver and Money Industry: No Longer Purchasing Gold and Silver Certificates from Banks and Firms

Daily Interest Rate Soars to 300 Yuan Due to Tight Money Supply

The National Bank suddenly notified the Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Association yesterday, stating that in the past, when banks and firms were unable to balance their positions, they often temporarily requested the National Bank to accommodate them by purchasing gold, silver, US dollars, or foreign exchange transfer certificates to overcome difficulties. However, the National Bank will no longer accommodate this request in the future to avoid criticism from the outside world. After receiving the telephone notification, the Silver and Money Industry Association immediately notified its member banks and firms to implement it. It is reported that after the National Bank sold off large amounts of gold last week, the money supply became extremely tight, and some banks and firms were in a very precarious situation. They were unable to balance their positions until late at night and requested the National Bank to purchase gold and silver. However, the outside world criticized the bank for taking the opportunity to purchase at low prices for profit, so the bank decided to stop purchasing. In the future, banks and firms must carefully handle their business to avoid unforeseen circumstances. Since the implementation of this measure, the money supply has become very tight, and the daily interest rate for every thousand yuan soared to around 300 yuan in the afternoon, and financial items experienced a sharp decline.

### Central Bank's Gold and Silver Have Arrived in Succession

[Report from Our Newspaper] A spokesperson for the Central Bank yesterday responsibly confirmed to reporters that the bank has indeed recently airlifted several batches of gold from the United States to Shanghai, with one batch each on April 2nd, 5th, and 9th. As for the exact amount of gold that has arrived, the spokesperson said that it was confidential and could not be disclosed directly.

In addition, to stabilize silver dollar prices, the bank is currently making every effort to search for raw materials needed to mint silver coins from overseas and is currently contacting various parties. However, a batch of purchased silver raw materials arrived in Shanghai by ship from overseas a few days ago. Upon opening the boxes, it was discovered that they were all silver dollars that circulated during the era of Australian coinage. These silver dollars are slightly smaller in area than the silver dollars currently circulating in China, but thicker, and the patterns are beautifully carved. Whether these silver dollars will be directly put into circulation or recast into "boat dollars" has not yet been finally decided, but they will certainly be used to stabilize silver dollar prices.

### Cotton Yarn Sees Slight Price Increase, Narrow Range of Fluctuations in the Fabric Market

Yesterday, the yarn market showed a slight increase. Under the tight money supply, large-scale transactions were not seen in the market. 42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 29 million yuan, but direct sales were weak. Holders were unable to push up the price, and the price gradually softened, finally closing at 27 million yuan, still an increase of 1 million yuan compared to the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix held steady at 11 million yuan. 32-count Silver Moon opened at 17.5 million yuan in the morning, once rising to 18 million yuan, but the upward trend ultimately failed to continue. The closing price was lower than the opening price, closing at 17 million yuan, an increase of 900,000 yuan.

21-count Double Horse spot goods were brisk, rising from 13.9 million to a maximum of 14.25 million yuan. The midday closing was 13.1 million yuan, an increase of 800,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse was 12.3 million yuan, 16-count Common Goods broke through the 10 million mark, and 10-count Boy Scout stood firm at 10 million yuan.

The rise in cotton cloth prices has slowed down. Due to the still tight money supply, depositors are unwilling to absorb, but holders are reluctant to sell due to high interest rates and increased costs. Therefore, the effectiveness in the market is less than before. Market prices initially rose and then remained stable. As a result, most of the prices remained at the same level as the previous day's after-market prices.

Spot goods of Longtou fine cloth once reached 51 yuan in the middle of the day, but no transactions were seen by the close. The midday closing price of warehouse receipts was 480,000 yuan, about 5,000 yuan higher than spot goods. The final price of Wufu fine cloth was 460,000 yuan, with no significant difference from the previous day.

### Despite Tight Money Supply, Shanghai Stocks Still Rise in the After-Market

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai stock market fluctuated wildly yesterday, with prices soaring and plummeting. Major investors switched from long to short positions, and retail investors fell into traps again. In the early morning, it was heard that banks and bureaus were dumping yarn and gold overnight, and a large amount of money was needed to make up for the difference yesterday. Remittances from other places were about to be withheld, and the tight money situation continued. Short sellers in the over-the-counter market were continuously suppressed and were waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. As a result, rumors were rampant, and the market was pulled up and then heavily suppressed, resulting in a reversal from rising to falling. Yongsha opened at 46 yuan in the morning, and the price was continuously pulled up in the over-the-counter market, rising to 50 yuan and 5 jiao. Then it was heard that the Central Bank was continuing to sell gold, and the financial authorities were said to be banning banks and firms from mortgaging gold and silver for loans. The implicit interest rate was as high as 23 yuan, and the interest rate for Yongsha was as high as 1 yuan and 5 fen, 1 yuan, 1 jiao, and 5 fen. Many retail investors rushed to sell, and short positions were prevalent on the surface. Banks and firms unanimously dumped, and the market plummeted, falling to 42 yuan and 2 jiao, with no one interested. Then, due to buying at low prices, the downward trend stabilized, and it finally rebounded to 44 yuan and 4 jiao at the midday closing.

Small and medium-sized stocks opened relatively stable in the morning, with limit-up prices occurring in the middle. Near the close, the prices all showed fatigue. Meiya opened high at 1 yuan, 3 jiao, and 5 fen, closing at 1 yuan and 1 jiao, 8 fen at midday. Xinguang opened at 3 yuan, 7 jiao, and 3 fen, dropping to 3 yuan and 2 jiao at the midday closing. Jingfu stood firm at 1 yuan and 7 jiao, dropping to 1 yuan, 5 jiao, and 4 fen at the midday closing. Qinxing opened at 2 yuan, 2 jiao, and 2 fen, falling to 2 yuan and 5 fen. Xinyi opened at the limit-up price and remained strong at the midday closing. The rest of the miscellaneous stocks mostly rose to the limit-up price after opening and remained strong near the close.

In the early afternoon, due to the extremely tight money supply, all stocks opened at low prices, but the previous suppression caused strong reactions from various groups. The market saw fierce competition and bidding, and the fluctuations were still large. Yongsha initially traded at 46 yuan, once dropping to 45 yuan, but was finally strongly supported by major investors, rising to the limit-up price of 53 yuan and 3 jiao, and the transaction was closed. The initial transaction was 42 yuan, then retreated to 40 yuan, and then rose to 50 yuan and 5 jiao, finally returning to 48 yuan at the close. The stocks that reached the limit-up price included Meiya at 1 yuan, 3 jiao, and 6 fen, Jingfu at 1 yuan and 7 jiao, Taiwan Sugar at 100,160 yuan, Zhonghuo at 2 yuan, 7 jiao, and 4 fen, Huaci at 1 yuan, 3 jiao, and 7 fen, Xinhua at 1 yuan and 8 jiao, Zhongfa at 9 yuan, 9 jiao, and 5 fen, Business at 10 yuan and 8 jiao, Zhabei at 7 yuan, 8 jiao, and 7 fen, and Guohuo at 7 jiao. The transaction volume was 4.84645 billion shares.

### Special Permission Granted to Extend Deadline for Repayment of Legal Tender Bonds to End of April

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the National Treasury Bureau of the National Bank, the Ministry of Finance previously stipulated that the case of graded, doubled, and early repayment of legal tender bonds should be completed within one month. Early repayment was carried out in accordance with the graded and doubled standards from February 11th and ended on March 10th. Now, some bondholders have not yet been able to collect their payments and have applied for flexible payment. In order to avoid losses to bondholders, the Ministry of Finance has specially extended the deadline to the end of April from now on for supplementary processing. The Bureau has notified the managing banks and bureaus in various places and the bank's branches and offices to handle supplementary repayment procedures from the 14th to the end of April. It is hoped that bondholders of legal tender bonds who have not yet been repaid will go to various banks and bureaus to handle supplementary collection procedures as soon as possible.

### Market Commentary

The Central Bank Avoids Profiteering, But Banks and Firms Are Terrified Again

Yesterday, the Central Bank issued a notice to the silver and money industry, stating: "In the future, the Central Bank will no longer accept requests from banks and firms to accept gold, silver, and US dollars from banks and firms and provide cash to offset positions, because the past implementation of this accommodation method has been criticized by the outside world: It is said that the Central Bank is purchasing at low prices and taking the opportunity to make huge profits. Therefore, this accommodation method will no longer be adopted to avoid further criticism."

The tone is extremely aggrieved, but the means are also extremely harsh.

The Central Bank thought, I am doing a job, purchasing gold certificates at market prices, originally intended to help banks and firms get through difficult times. You use customer deposits to earn huge profits from gold certificates, which is why you can't balance your positions. I am helping you, but you repay kindness with ingratitude. Why should I invite criticism in vain?

However, from the perspective of the banks and firms, this move by the Central Bank is simply deliberately making things difficult for them. Banks and firms collect deposits and have to pay interest. The Ministry of Finance opened the market for buying and selling gold certificates earlier and then restored the gold market later. If banks and firms don't buy gold certificates, where will the deposit interest come from? When the money supply suddenly becomes tight, selling gold certificates to offset positions is already a desperate situation. The Central Bank is originally the bank of banks. Supplying positions is an inescapable responsibility. Buying at low prices is tantamount to profiteering. It is not the attitude that the Central Bank should have. Now, instead of trying to improve its attitude, it simply refuses to take responsibility for relief. It cannot be said that the Central Bank's methods are harsh if it intends to sit idly by and watch banks and firms collapse due to not being able to balance their positions.

From the perspective of us spectators on the sidelines: Both sides have their own rights and wrongs.

(1) Banks and firms use customer deposits to buy gold certificates and make money. When they can't get through difficult times, the Central Bank comes to the rescue. This shows that the Central Bank's "relief" is equivalent to encouraging banks and firms to speculate on gold certificates. This kind of "relief" should have been stopped long ago. Today's cessation cannot be said to be a kind of awakening.

(2) Banks and firms collect deposits and have to pay a daily interest of 15 yuan per thousand yuan. Although the daily interest on loans is at least 60 yuan per thousand yuan, earning a profit of 45 yuan, the price level is so high and the expenses are so huge. Since the authorities allow the buying and selling of gold certificates, and the profits from buying and selling gold certificates are very high, the Central Bank's unwillingness to accept gold certificates when there is a shortage of funds seems unfair.

In fact, arguing about right and wrong is superfluous. It is important to plan for the aftermath. I have a few suggestions to offer.

(1) In the future, the Central Bank should first fully supply large bills and first eliminate the malpractice of banks and firms issuing banker's drafts. Because the indiscriminate issuance of banker's drafts carries the risk of simultaneous redemption of banker's drafts. This is also a potential reason shaking finance. Of course, this reason is not recognized by most banks and firms.

(2) In the future, the Central Bank should lower interest rates and abandon the current high-interest rate policy. This will be beneficial to prices. Especially in the current situation, the high-interest rate policy is extremely stupid.

(3) In the future, large banks and firms can replace the Central Bank in obtaining huge profits. As long as the business hours are extended to 8:00 PM every day. If any peer needs to adjust positions, large banks and firms with positions are happy to fully accept gold certificates and make a profit.

### Huili and Hualian Show Their Skills One After Another: Prelude to the Mayor's Cup Basketball Tournament; Two Friendly Matches Are Wonderful

(Report from This Newspaper) The Mayor's Cup Basketball Tournament is about to open. Last night, the strong teams of the Municipal Gymnasium performed a preliminary exploration, attracting 3,000 fans and lively cheers. (1) Huili defeated Renyu with a score of 51 to 39. In the first half, Renyu led by one point with a score of 16 to 15. (2) Hualian defeated McLins with a score of 53 to 48. In the first half, Hualian led with a score of 30 to 18. Both opening games were quite tense and stimulating.

Renyu's shooting was always inaccurate, and the performance was lax. The first half was barely won by one point. Huili B team's main player Shang Chongyu scored 21 points alone, showing a promising posture. Cao Zhiji and Tian Fuhai's prowess remained the same. Huili once led by 14 points twice, and the morale was very high. The sufficient reserves were also a major reason for the victory last night.

The players who appeared for McLins were the Third Team, replacing the Ninth Team. The forwards Xu, Hairs, and Kai Xiong were fierce and formidable. Coupled with the Ninth Team's Laimushan, the first half was played well, especially Huarxu, who showed the demeanor of a general. McLins tied Hualian twice at 7-7 and 11-11. It is a pity that the defense was too loose, and Hualian gained an advantage under the basket, gradually gaining the upper hand. Coupled with Hualian's Liu Fushan, Bao Songyuan, and Cheng Yidi's smooth shooting, McLins' defense was finally broken, and Hualian led by 30 to 18 in the first half. In the second half, Hualian had an easy ride, and McLins tried to catch up, narrowing the gap to 5 or 6 points, but due to the chaotic formation, McLins still lost. The final score was a difference of 5 points. The battles of the two games were as follows:

Huili vs. Renyu

In the first game between Renyu and Huili, the five players for Renyu were Xu Zhongyi, Sun Guozheng, Wu Xinyun, Li Ronghe, and Zhuang Yirong. The players for Huili were Cao Zhiji, Tian Fuhai, Wei, Ye Yunshan, and Chen Zhengmiao.

After the contact, Huili's Zhengmiao missed a free throw, and Zhiji followed up with a basket, Zhongyi scored two baskets within 30 seconds, and Zhengmiao retaliated, tying the score at 4-4. Guozheng and Zhiji tied the score at 6-6. Renyu took a timeout, Lao Cao showed his prowess under the basket, and Fuhai scored a free throw, giving Huili a three-point lead. Suddenly, the three players Zhuang, Li, and Xu, one on the left and one on the right, allowed Renyu to surpass Huili with a score of 13 to 10. Huili replaced Cao, Wei, and Ye with Bai Baokang, Shang Chong, and Lu Dinghou. Shang showed his skills as soon as he entered the court, competing with Zhongyi, making the score 15 to 12. Yao Jiao replaced Wu. Although Yirong had not played for a long time, he performed well at this time. Xiao Yao also showed his style. Renyu's Shen Shihua replaced Zhongyi, Huili's Cao and Ye took turns, and Chong scored nine consecutive points, allowing Huili to move forward again. Suddenly, the score was tied at 15-15. Yao Jiao scored a free throw, giving Renyu a one-point lead in the first half, with a score of 16 to 15.

In the second half, Huili's Wei and Yunshan were fouled out, and Dinghou, Baokang, and Ren replaced Pengju. Fuhai made a quick shot, and Zhiji each scored a basket, surpassing Renyu with a score of 19 to 16. Renyu called another timeout. Xin Yun replaced Jiao. Chong's madness soon made the score 37 to 18. When Renyu changed the formation to 42 to 18, Renyu added seven consecutive points, seemingly showing signs of resurgence. Unexpectedly, veteran Zhiji showed his prowess and also added seven points, allowing Huili to lead by 14 points again. As a result, Huili defeated Renyu with a score of 51 to 39, a difference of 12 points.

The Hualian vs. McLins Game

In the game between Hualian and McLins, Hualian's starting five were Liu Fuhai, Li Zhenzhong, Bao Songyuan, Fu Jinsheng, and Wu Chengzhang. Lao Bao scored a three-pointer as soon as he took the court, and the audience cheered. McLins' Haike managed to score a basket, and Fushan also made a contribution, and Chengzhang scored again. Suddenly, McLins' Wells, Haike, etc. became active, and the score was tied at 7-7. Xiao Le replaced Fushan, and both sides were in a tug-of-war. Bao scored a free throw, tying the score at 11-11. The members of the "Tattoo Party" (most of McLins' players had tattoos on their arms) were doing well on both sides, with a score of 14 to 11. Hualian cheered on, and Le and Wu worked together, initially chasing to 15 to 14. Liangxiong replaced Zhenzhong, and Hualian's Bao, Hu, and Le were rampant, making McLins have no chance to fight back. The score was 30 to 18 in the first half.

After the break, Hualian's Li Zhenzhong returned to the court, replacing Fu Jinsheng, and Liu Fushan replaced Wu Chengzhang. McLins did not make any changes. After the contact, Le Jiazhou actually missed the basket, and McLins took the opportunity to attack. Kai Xiong made a basket, and Fushan scored again. Songyuan scored twice, and Hails followed suit. The battle between the two sides became fierce, and the performance was extraordinary, and fouls also occurred frequently. Laimushan scored a long shot, and Wu Chengzhang scored, replacing Songyuan. Hualian's shot went over the basket. Hails made two sneak attacks, chasing the score to 34 to 41. Zhenzhong made a long shot, and Hails and Laimushan worked together, and Hualian called a timeout. Fu Jinsheng replaced Zhang Liangxiong, Annas committed a foul, and Jiazhou made two free throws, adding to Fushan's score, and Hualian's score rose again. McLins called a timeout. Haike replaced Annas, and Fushan dragged the ball into the basket. McLins tried to catch up, but time was running out, and they made a strong counterattack. The bell rang, and the result was 48 to 53, losing to Hualian by a difference of five points.

Hualian's scores were as follows:

Player Field Goals Free Throws Fouls Points

Fu Jinsheng 0 0 5 0

### Democratic Cup Football Match in Nantao: Pan Team and Daxia Each Draw, Shortcomings in Rough Actions

Yesterday's Democratic Cup football match between Daxia and Pan Team resulted in a 1-1 draw, with no winner. Daxia kicked off and attacked first, and Jin Xiqi scored a goal within a few minutes. After 20 minutes of stalemate in the second half, Ou Huizu from Pan Team returned a goal, tying the score at 1-1. Shortly after, Yu Lishen fouled in the penalty area and was awarded a penalty kick. Yu was dissatisfied and verbally abused the referee. Situ Hou took the penalty kick, and in order to quell the situation, he deliberately shot wildly. There were many rough actions in this game, especially the antagonistic behavior between Lu Meixiong and Xu Tonghua, which was inappropriate. The referee issued a penalty to each of the two to ease the tension.

### Women's Basketball Techniques

— Translated and narrated by Qi Gong

(B) Guiding fixed-position plays. (I) Fixed-position plays can be heavily used in the following situations:

(A) When initiating an offensive from the center. (B) When throwing the ball in from out of bounds. Speed is crucial; mastering two distinct fixed formations is sufficient to counter the opponent's defensive formations.

(Note) In men's rules, fixed formations can be used occasionally but not excessively, but in women's rules, they are quite suitable. As Anderson stated, mastering two formations can enhance the offense. This requires each player to clearly understand her role and know when to move, coordinating with the movements of all players on the court, working towards a single goal. This can break the opponent's tight marking defense. In China, throwing the ball in and throwing it in from out of bounds can be implemented under the cover of a screen. The disadvantage is that if the opponent's defenders see through it, they can quickly switch to zone defense to break the fixed formation.

(II) Key points for achieving good results in games. (A) Sufficient proficiency is required. (B) Passing and movement must be timed appropriately. (C) Allow players to appropriately utilize their intelligence. (D) Fully use and control signals and gestures.

(III) Suggestions for initiating an offense in China to break man-to-man defense.

(A) The receiver should move forward to receive the ball passed by the center. (1) The forward runs out from the corner of the baseline towards the center line. (2) The forward diagonally crosses the court from the corner of the baseline towards the center line. (3) The forward runs in a zigzag pattern towards the center line, making diagonal forward or retreating cuts.

(B) Variations of basic movement to receive the ball.

(1) When players begin to move into position—either in skirmish formation, side-by-side, or following one another in single file—their positions are in the backcourt, midcourt, or sidelines. (2) Direction—The diagonal routes for forward cross-cuts should use a figure-eight formation, and other forwards should also use the opposite cut when charging in. (3) Timing—Forwards can adopt a slow-attack method when initiating an offense to lure the opponent's defender away from their position, but they must be able to increase speed immediately. In this case, it is best for one forward to advance with high speed while the other moves slowly.

(C) Creating a shooting position. (1) The basic forward movement to receive the ball described in section A can follow the jump to grab the aerial ball and rebound described earlier. The player in white jersey number fifteen jumped too early, and one foot was already on the ground, so the ball was snatched by the player in blue. Looking at the position of his changing hands, it is clear that this is the result of time adjustment during the jump, faking a move in one direction and suddenly turning and charging in to create a shooting position. (2) Three forwards can split into three straight lines and charge towards the baseline, with one forward or both wing forwards circling towards the baseline, receiving the center's pass to create a shooting position. (3) The center can pass the ball to the wings and then follow the ball, circling forward. (4) Use a figure-eight self cross-cut to create a shooting position. (5) Create a shooting opportunity using a screen. For example: (A) Use a single screen to allow a forward to cut in unguarded and gain a shooting opportunity. (B) Use a screen for continuous passing into the baseline.

Conclusion. The above methods are effective for attacking man-to-man defense. Using the figure-eight cross-cut offensive formation and various screens often yields success.

It is essential that individual players are proficient in various basic skills, thoroughly understand the offensive and defensive theories of training, and use their intelligence to seize the shooting opportunities they obtain in order to break through a team skilled in moving area. (End)

### League of College Athletic Federations Basketball Tournament with Fourteen Men's and Women's Schools Participating

The basketball tournament organized by the Shanghai Higher Education Institution Sports Federation includes ten schools in the men's group: Guangdong, Minli, Hujiang, Datong, Provincial Shanghai High School, Fudan, Huxin, Lixing, Chongshi, and Overseas Chinese. The women's group includes four schools: Minli, Qixiu, Aodong, and Chongshi. The men's group uses a knockout system, and the women's group uses a single round-robin system. The tournament will kick off this week. The schedule is as follows: (1) Minzhu vs. Overseas Chinese, (2) Provincial Shanghai High School vs. Lixing, (3) Fudan vs. Huxin, (4) Minzhu vs. Chongshi (women). The responsible parties from each school are responsible for coordinating the game venues, dates, and times themselves.

The Last Two Matches of the Group B2 Basketball League

Today is the final day of the divisional schedule for Group B2 of the basketball league, with a total of two matches. They will be held at the Municipal Gymnasium starting from 5:30 PM. The first match will be between Group A's Donghua and West Green Blue, with referees Yu Juju and Chen Songliang. The second match will be between Group D's Shan Team and Dolphin, refereed by Chen Baolin and Wu Shishi. The second match is extremely important for the top spot and is sure to be exciting. Tickets remain the same price: 2,500 yuan for the upper level, 5,000 yuan for the lower level, and 8,000 yuan for reserved seats inside the venue.

In the match between Donghua and West Green Blue, Donghua has been consistently victorious. Securing the top spot in that group should not be an issue. Even if they lose to West Green Blue today, they will have the same record as Xun, but Xun's overall score will not be as good as Donghua. Furthermore, Donghua has many strong players like Cai Yanxiong, Zhang Banglun, Jia Youliang, and Li, who are as lively as dragons and tigers and extremely agile. The little players of West Green are difficult to match, but resistance will be inevitable when the time comes.

The second match between the Shan team and the Dolphin team is of great importance to the future of the top spot. According to the group, Pushui is temporarily in first place with four wins and one loss. The Shan team and the Dolphin team are close behind with three wins and one loss. If the Shan team wins against the Dolphin team tonight, then the Shan team can get first place. If the Dolphin team wins against the Shan team, then Pushui will remain in first place. Although the Dolphin team itself has no hope of finishing first, the outcome of the second place, as well as the ranking in the final standings, will depend on this match.

East China - West Green Blue (Group B2A) 5:30 PM

Shan Team - Dolphin (Group B2D) 6:30 PM

### Boston Marathon to be Held Grandly on the 19th

(United Press Boston, December 12) The 53rd Boston Marathon long-distance running competition is scheduled to open on the 19th of this month, and preparations have already been completed. According to the competition director, Canari, at least 175 athletes from various countries will participate this time. Registration is scheduled to close at midnight today. Last year's champion, Korean athlete Xu Renfu, has not yet registered. Two weeks ago, Yu received a telegram from Korea saying that Xu and two other athletes were on their way to the United States. Since then, there has been no news. These people probably landed on the West Coast, hid somewhere, practiced secretly, and then sailed to Boston to make a sensational move.

### On Moral Standards

— Wang Chongmin

The reason why today's society is so precarious is, on the one hand, due to the fact that society itself is suffering from quite serious ailments, and on the other hand, it must be said that it is due to the lack of correct moral concepts among the general public. Most people stand on the position of their own interests to measure morality. Whatever is beneficial to themselves is considered moral, otherwise it is immoral. Therefore, when they feel that they cannot survive, using a means of harming others to achieve their desire to survive is a very reasonable moral logic in their minds. Another type of person is the opposite of the above. Their moral views have a strong religious nature, believing that patience, tolerance, and not competing with others are the basic spirit of morality. Didn't Jesus say this? If someone strikes you on the left cheek, you should offer them the right cheek as well. They feel that this kind of sacrificial spirit is the highest expression of morality.

Today's society is almost dominated by these two distorted moral views.

For the first type of person, we can easily point out their error in moral concepts. Because survival is a very natural and urgent requirement, but using unreasonable means to deprive others of their right to survival as a price for exchanging one's own survival is a moral argument that is difficult to justify no matter what.

Talking about the second type of person, the reason why they "offer the right cheek to the enemy" is definitely not that they sincerely want their own flesh to suffer pain, but because the general public has the misconception that "suffering a loss is a gain." Because they think that those who hit people will sooner or later be hit by others, or even when they get to "Yama's" place, they will also be punished. Thinking like this, it seems that the one who really suffers is not oneself but the enemy, and one cannot help but feel calm and have a kind of Ah Q-style joy. From this, it can be seen that these people are absolutely not really willing to be beaten and suffer losses. Their ultimate goal is still to take advantage. The reason why they "offer the right cheek to the enemy" is just a means to achieve the goal of taking advantage in the future.

Now we have realized that interest—taking advantage—is the common requirement of the masses. Whether it is a murdering demon or a devout believer, they all want to go down the road of "taking advantage" directly or indirectly. Since "taking advantage" is sought by everyone, it is naturally a truth and a morality. Conversely, the saying "suffering a loss is a gain" violates the truth and also violates morality. Suffering a loss is definitely not moral, and patience is definitely not a virtue. Because true morality is definitely not teaching people to suffer losses and be patient, but teaching people how to take advantage and fight. However, if we once violate human nature and use cruel means to seize and exploit the lives and property of others as capital for our own survival and enjoyment, then we will fall into the quagmire of sin and immorality. The correct moral concept lies in how to use one's own wisdom and strength to discover new sources and create new environments, and to strive for one's own happiness and interests reasonably under the principle of not hindering the interests of others.

### "On Yuan Shikai"

— Beibei

In history class, the teacher gave a topic: "On Yuan Shikai".

A certain student, after pondering for a long time, wrote:

"According to recent research, Shikai's real surname is 'Yuan', born in the 'Third Year of the Republic of China', is a 'giant' figure in the history of the Republic of China, with a majestic appearance, a radiant face, and 'bright eyes', but sometimes half-open and half-closed, in a contemplative state, very much like a great thinker of the era. In the 24th year of the Republic of China, he died of illness, but his spirit remained after his death, appearing in the world from time to time. To this day, the common people often see him in their dreams.

Some time ago, historians did not understand and often criticized 'Yuan'; but recently, there have been few who criticize 'Yuan' himself. On the contrary, men and women, especially Catholic personnel, mostly regard him as a 'savior', and his value has even surpassed the American sages 'Washington' and 'Lincoln'.

Looking at the historical figures of the Republic of China, the one who is still deeply loved by the broad masses of people is 'Yuan', who is the number one person. The facts are all there, and it is not intentional flattery."

Western Humor

A beggar followed a well-dressed gentleman, begging for money to buy something to eat.

"Shall I buy you a glass of wine?" the gentleman said to the beggar.

"I don't drink alcohol, please just give me money to buy something to eat."

The gentleman took a cigar from his bag and gave it to the beggar: "Take a cigar to eat!"

"Thank you, sir." The beggar pleaded, "Please give me five dimes, I just want to buy something to eat to fill my stomach."

"Okay," the gentleman finally said, "I'll give you five dimes, but you have to come home with me, I want to show my wife! What someone who doesn't drink alcohol and doesn't smoke looks like!"

### Tales of Wuzhi Mountain

— Fang Zhou

Recently, a friend who had just returned from a trip to Hainan Island came to visit. During the conversation, he talked about the strange objects and scenery of Wuzhi Mountain in Hainan Island, as well as the strange customs and habits of the native Li people in the mountains. I couldn't help but listen with great interest, half-believing and half-doubting, and I seemed to see scenes like those in "Tarzan the Ape Man".

According to my friend, Wuzhi Mountain is covered with dense vegetation, and the grass grows so tall that it is impossible to see people. Ferocious beasts and poisonous snakes lurk among them. Except for places where there are villages, people do not dare to travel with their bare hands. Moreover, in the deep mountains, there are also strange plants that have never been heard of, such as the dragon claw vine, which is dozens of feet long and has claws on the vine that look like dragon claws, hence the name. If an animal touches the vine claw, it will be entangled by the vine, and the winding force is extremely strong. No matter how strong the animal's strength is, it is difficult to break free until the blood is sucked dry by the vine, and then the vine claw will stretch out again. There is also a kind of pitcher plant, shaped like a pig cage, with a lid on top. If an animal accidentally falls into the cage, the lid will close immediately and suffocate the animal to death.

My friend said that he had never seen the dragon claw vine, but he had seen the pitcher plant with his own eyes. He said that the pitcher plant is more than a foot in diameter, and small animals are often in danger of being killed by it.

There are hundreds of thousands of native Li people living in Wuzhi Mountain. The Li people have a slightly dark brown complexion, and most of their teeth are black. This is because there are many betel nuts in the mountains, and the Li people often eat this fruit. The betel nut juice can make the teeth turn black.

Both Li men and women keep their hair in buns, and the women insert flowers into their buns as decoration. Most of the men's upper bodies are naked, and they wear cloth pants. And the strangest thing is: young girls all have patterns painted on their faces. Meeting them in the dark night, they are like Rakshasas, making people shudder. However, the Li people think this is "beauty", so the more beautiful the Li woman, the more patterns and the more complex they are on her face. Sometimes, they also wear some animal bones on their necks as decorations.

Because their wild nature has not been eliminated, the Li people are extremely irritable and often resort to violence and murder. However, to date, 70 percent of the Li people have been assimilated by the Han people. Some of them know how to cultivate and trade, while others still live by hunting.

Disease is a major threat to the Li people. They have no medicine and only know how to pray to ghosts and gods to drive away diseases. In their minds, "disease ghosts" often possess women, so when someone is sick and dying, wealthy Li people will ask witches to perform rituals to exorcise ghosts. The witch gathers all the women in the Tong (Li village name), muttering incantations, and points to a woman with her finger. This woman is the "disease ghost", so a large group of people beat her half to death until the witch orders her to stop. Only then can she go home injured. Some even die for no reason.

### An Experiment in Focus Education

— Daoxian

The education industry in the United States spends billions of dollars a year, but the results are often unsatisfactory. Children in modern schools know less about math and English than their grandfathers did in school. Although education authorities have made great efforts to increase teacher salaries and expand school facilities, they have paid little attention to this fact.

But two institutions have noticed this. One is "Hiram College" in Ohio, and the other is "Kiskiminetas Springs School" in Pennsylvania.

The education system of these two schools is extremely simple. That is: only learn one course at a time. For example, for two months, students only learn Spanish and nothing else; in another two months, they focus on algebra. Concentrate on one point and study attentively. This system is similar to the "special skills training course" run by the Army Department during World War II, and it has achieved great results.

Look at the schools now, students study English one hour, then algebra the next, followed by biology and history. And the teachers do not communicate with each other and assign a lot of homework. Students are either overwhelmed or simply ignore everything.

Let's talk about the aforementioned "Kiskiminetas Springs School" again. The headmaster of the school, Dr. Clark, carefully studied and found that nine out of ten students had no interest in the courses they praised. Students had to study hard for a certain amount of time to cope with their homework, but in fact they didn't like it.

Is there a way to make students love their homework? Dr. Clark studied for several months and finally came up with the idea of implementing "focus education", which began in the fall of 1944.

He divided the year into four semesters, each with nine weeks, and a review period in the spring. In this way, each student only studies four courses a year, and after four years, they can take the college entrance examination.

The result of this educational method was quite effective. Only four students were eliminated due to poor grades at graduation last year. In the past, the graduating class always had twelve to fifteen students eliminated. The general average grade of students has increased by about ten points. In the college entrance examination, the admission standard of first-class universities is between 400 and 500 points. Sixty-three Kiskiminetas Springs School graduates took the math exam, and only six people scored below 400 points.

Will this new education system make students feel tired? The results of the survey among students proved that it was not. Students only need to focus on studying in the classroom, and they don't need to review at home. And the students feel that they are indeed learning one course, not just rushing to finish a semester's course. Some people asked: Will students feel a lack of variety? In fact, students don't feel any change in interest when they take an English class and then switch to a trigonometry class.

Dr. Ballfy, the headmaster of Hiram College, said: This education system does not solve all educational problems. But in any case, it can give both smart and dull students the opportunity to develop their intelligence. It also teaches students how to solve problems sequentially, which is a valuable training for them when they enter society in the future.

I wonder if Chinese educators are willing to try this method?
