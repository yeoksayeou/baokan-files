### Talks by Central Executive and Supervisory Committee Members of the Kuomintang on the President's Peace Message: Explanation of the Process by Zhang Qun and Zhang Zhizhong

[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] Following the publication of the President's message, there have been numerous reactions from various quarters. Today, the Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members of the Kuomintang in Nanjing held a discussion meeting at 4:00 PM to deliberate on the main theme of peace advocated in the President's message and to express their opinions, aiming to propose various ways to achieve the goal of peace. The meeting was chaired by Ma Chaojun, with dozens of Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members in Nanjing attending. First, Zhang Qun and Zhang Zhizhong reported separately on the sources and process of the atmosphere of peace before and after the publication of the President's message. They also explained the divisions within the government on the attitude towards peace and war since the beginning of the Northeast conflict and its development. After their reports, Huang Shaogu and Xu Yongchang reported separately on the reactions in the political and military spheres after the publication of the President's message. Subsequently, Zhang Daofan, Gu Zhenggang, Chen Yiyun, Song Shuqiao, Shao Hua, Liu Wendao, Ren Zhuoxuan, Cao Jun, and others spoke separately. Some expressed disagreement with the President's expression of the issue of advance and retreat in the message. The discussion on this point was extremely intense, with Zhang Daofan and Gu Zhenggang arguing vehemently. However, no conclusion was reached. Shao Lizi, who has long been regarded as an advocate of peace, also attended the meeting on the 4th but did not speak and was seen dozing off in his seat. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM. All opinions expressed at the meeting were handed over to Huang Shaogu, Zhang Daofan, Gu Zhenggang, Zhong Tianxin, and others for compilation before being submitted to the Central Standing Committee for discussion. Once a conclusion is reached, it will be presented to the Director-General for review. Furthermore, the meeting on the 4th was kept strictly confidential, and attendees agreed not to make any public statements. Therefore, very little is known to the outside world.

[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] The Kuomintang Central Political Committee held a meeting on the morning of the 4th, chaired by Sun Ke, who presented a report on the peace issue.

[United Press Nanjing, 4th] As of now, there has been no response from the Communist Party regarding the President's New Year's Day message calling for peace. Most observers here believe that if the Communist Party remains silent for a prolonged period, it will be very significant for the overall situation. It is rumored that the Communist Party's response may demand that the National Army lay down their arms and cease hostilities, and that they have dispatched representatives to Nanjing and Shanghai. However, those awaiting a response believe this is wishful thinking.

[Associated Press Nanjing, 4th] The official wait for the Communist Party's response to President Chiang's peace message entered its fourth day on the 4th, but the Communist Party remained "presumptively" silent.

Further meetings between President Chiang and government officials were not held on the 3rd and 4th. They may reserve further action to await clarification of the Communist Party's attitude. At the same time, there is a widespread feeling among official and non-official circles that the Communist Party will likely reject the President's proposals. Some had predicted that the Communist Party broadcast on the evening of the 3rd would include Mao Zedong's official response, but in fact, the broadcast only reiterated the Xinhua News Agency's editorial, emphasizing the determination to fight to the end until the Kuomintang lays down its arms. According to unconfirmed reports, the government is inviting Zhang Dongsun, Zhang Shenfu, Liang Qiushui, former leaders of the Democratic League now in Beiping, and Liang Shuming in Chongqing, to Nanjing to participate in peace discussions.

[Our Beiping Office, 4th] Yesterday, a local newspaper reported that Zhang Dongsun would be invited to leave Beiping for Nanjing soon to mediate peace. Reporters from various newspapers here went out to interview Zhang yesterday, but were unable to see him. According to his son, Zhang Zongbing, his father has not been invited and has no intention of flying south recently.

### The Possibility of Inviting Four Nations to Mediate Depends on the Communist Party's Response: U.S. Ambassador Says the President's Message is a Prelude to Reopening Peace Talks

[United Press Nanjing, 4th] According to sources close to the government, the Chinese government intends to invite the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to mediate in order to resume peace talks with the Communist Party, but this will only be done after the Communist Party's response is unfavorable or clearly rejects President Chiang's New Year's Day message calling for peace.

[Associated Press Nanjing, 4th] Zhang Zhizhong, the government's "Peace General," and Shao Lizi, the "Peace Elder," said that foreign mediation is necessary and should be welcomed.

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 3rd] General Zhang Zhizhong hosted a banquet for cultural and press circles in the capital at Jieshou Hall on the evening of the 3rd. In his speech at the banquet, Zhang tried his best to avoid discussing political issues related to the current situation. Shao Lizi was invited to speak and emphasized that peace is not impossible, and he hoped that peace would be achieved.

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 3rd] After the publication of the President's New Year's Day message, U.S. Ambassador Stuart expressed in private conversations with reporters that he had a very good impression of the President's message. He confidently told reporters: "I absolutely do not want to make any public statements, but I believe that the President's message will undoubtedly be a prelude to reopening peace negotiations, and I believe that there will be a corresponding response from the Communist Party within days." The Ambassador repeatedly emphasized that his conversation with reporters was of a private nature and went on to say, "The Chinese people have been through war for a long time and urgently need to rest and recuperate. The most important thing at present is economic recovery."

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 2nd] When commenting on the China issue, State Department Press Officer McDermott denied the newspaper reports that a member of the Chinese cabinet had asked the U.S. Embassy in Nanjing to mediate in the Chinese civil war. McDermott said: "No formal request has been made by Nanjing, and I am not aware of any informal request."

### Decisive Peace

May Still Require Battles

[United Press Beiping, 4th] According to general opinion in North China, President Chiang's New Year's Day message has placed all issues between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party on a political rather than a military basis, but it may still require several battles. Decisive peace may not be achieved for several months, but the people of North China are greatly relieved to see that the end of the war is in sight.

[United Press Nanjing, 4th] According to well-informed sources, Nationalist aircraft are dropping leaflets over Communist positions, urging the Communist Party to stop the war and implement peace talks. This is part of the National Army's peace offensive.

### Qingdao U.S. Marines: Report of Withdrawal Untrue

[United Press, Our City] U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Badger telegraphed from Qingdao on the evening of the 4th, denying the report of the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in China. According to him, this rumor originated from the expiration of the U.S. Navy's lease of Shandong University's school buildings. Previously, the U.S. Navy authorities had consulted with the Chinese Ministry of Education on returning the university's school buildings for educational purposes. It is now understood that this led to the mistaken report of withdrawal. Badger has ordered the suspension of negotiations.

[United Press, Our City] U.S. officials here stated today that the report of the withdrawal of U.S. Marines from Qingdao is untrue. It is thought to be a misunderstanding of the withdrawal of ordinary workers employed by the U.S. military. The U.S. military has no intention of returning the barracks within Shandong University in Qingdao.

[United Press Washington, 3rd] The State Department expressed surprise tonight at the report of the withdrawal of 3,000 U.S. Marines from Qingdao, but as Pacific Fleet Commander Badger has the authority to issue such an order, it is not entirely impossible.

[Our Qingdao Office, 4th] 250 U.S. Marines were transferred to Guam and left Qingdao yesterday morning.

### U.S. Military Advisory Group: Gradual Withdrawal from China

[United Press Guangzhou, 4th] The personnel of the U.S. Naval Advisory Group stationed in Guangzhou packed their luggage this afternoon, and their commander, Lockwood, flew to Shanghai by naval aircraft. This was expected and does not affect the status of their agency in Shanghai.

He also hopes that the long-term maintenance of trust between the two countries will indeed be a barrier to peace in the Far East, and therefore both countries will definitely benefit from it. Furthermore, Korean Foreign Minister Gao Changyi, in a telegram of thanks to Foreign Minister Wu Tiecheng through Zheng Huanfan, the Korean diplomatic representative in China, said: "On behalf of the Korean people, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Chinese government for the actions it has taken."

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 1st] The White House announced on the 1st that the United States recognizes the government of the Republic of Korea.

### Increase in Bandit Troops Outside Beiping: Frequent Movement of Lin Biao's Troops Around Tianjin: National Army Continues to Search and Suppress in the Tangda Area

[Our Beiping Office, 4th] The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters reported that the number of bandit troops outside Beiping has increased to seven columns, four of which have been transferred from Xinbao'an, Zhangtan, and other places under Nie Rongzhen and Shao. According to intelligence obtained by the military, the bandits seem to be preparing to attack the city. The highest military authorities in North China have made the necessary deployments.

[Our Tianjin Office, 4th] The main force of Lin Biao's bandit troops is gathering around Tianjin, with frequent and erratic movements.

### The Communist Party's Saying "Overthrow Fu Zuoyi" Has Aroused Antipathy and Distrust Among the People of North China

[Associated Press Reporter Jion, Beiping, 4th] As far as Beiping is concerned, the Communist Party has made a major psychological blunder. They do not understand the extent to which General Fu Zuoyi is supported by the people, and their personal attacks on him and listing him on the "war criminal" list have aroused general antipathy and distrust. The latest example of this blunder: A reporter learned from the mouth of a "beggar" - but in the tone of a servant, it could be said: "He is not an ordinary beggar." The reporter invited this tall, middle-aged man in a long robe "beggar" inside, offered him a cup of tea, and talked about the past. He was originally a village school teacher who had just come to Beiping three days ago. He told me that three weeks ago, the Communist Party visited his village. The Communist troops behaved well, and a political worker took the initiative to find him and said that he could continue teaching because he had often criticized the Communist Party in the past. This was somewhat flattered. The political workers repeatedly came to his school to promote the good of the Communist Party and the bad of the Kuomintang. However, one day, they posted a slogan on the wall of the playground: "Overthrow Fu Zuoyi and there will be peace" (the reporter saw this slogan). The climax came because the villagers all admired General Fu Yisheng, and the garrison under his command had very good discipline when stationed in the village, so the villagers' reaction was very bad. Many people talked to the teacher and expressed shock at this point. The next day, he was called by the political workers, who said that he was holding "anti-communist and anti-people" talks at home. After being interrogated for several hours, he was sent home, told not to leave, and would be questioned later. But at night, he and several villagers escaped into Beiping together. He said that before the Communist Party attacked Fu Zuoyi, he had planned to go on because the Communist Party did not investigate the past, and he wanted to deal with them! (See the article "Reflections of Peace on the Frontline" on page 2)

### Calls for Ceasefire from Various Provincial Delegates; Hubei Prepares to Form Peace Promotion Association

Speakers were enthusiastic, and all agreed that the door to peace talks had been reopened by the government's declaration.

In addition, telegrams were sent to various provinces and cities requesting them to send representatives of the people to Hubei to organize a nationwide peace promotion organization in order to find ways to overcome all difficulties in realizing peace.

The entire country is eagerly anticipating and earnestly hoping that you will carefully consider and make a decisive decision, regard the trend of popular sentiment, and determine the grand plan for peace. First, strictly order all armies on the front lines to cease offensive operations, remain stationed in their respective areas, and obey orders for resolution. If there are disputes, "they must be made public to the people of the country, so as to avoid the scourge of war today and rescue [them] from fire and water."

[Our Hankou Office, 4th] The Hubei Provincial Assembly passed the following measures to promote peace on the 3rd: (1) Telegraph Mao Zedong again, requesting him to immediately cease fire and reopen peace talks. (2) Mobilize various provinces to organize a nationwide peace promotion organization to expand the peace movement. Before it is formed, the Assembly will first initiate the organization of the Hubei Province Peace Promotion Association, inviting respected elders and social notables from the province to participate.

It stated in brief: China's eight years of war have exhausted the people's blood and sweat, and three years of internal strife have nearly exhausted the country's vitality. Being descendants of the Yellow Emperor, is it necessary to hasten ruin? It is especially hoped that the gentlemen of the Communist Party will observe the trend of popular sentiment, understand the unreliability of military force, abandon prejudices, and show sincerity to each other. Immediately cease the war and resolve all issues peacefully. The timing is urgent and fleeting. The gentlemen of the Communist Party will either be great figures of the Chinese nation forever or be the sinners of the Chinese nation forever. The principle is clear; the choice is yours.

[Another Telegram] The liaison association of national representatives from twenty-nine northern provinces and cities and various professional groups telegraphed the Communist Party authorities Mao Zedong et al. on the 4th, stressing the importance of the nation's lifeline and the people's livelihood, hoping to quickly adopt the spirit of the Political Consultative Conference and jointly discuss concrete measures for peace.

### Editorial: Let the Master Speak!

During the three-day New Year's holiday, there was a major development in the overall national situation. The door to peace has been opened by the President's New Year's Day Message. From south to north, from east to west, the Chinese people seem to be smiling.

However, at the same time, the Chinese Communist Party's radio station is still vehemently criticizing the government's call for peace, saying that it is "a common conspiracy of the Chinese reactionaries and American aggressors" and that the British and French governments are also "supporting this policy of American imperialism." Therefore, they firmly advocate that "the revolution cannot be abandoned halfway" and must be fought to the end. We common people cannot help but feel that a layer of shadow is floating over the bright future.

The Shanghai Municipal Assembly, representing the six million citizens of Shanghai, took the lead on the 2nd in telegraphing both the government and the Communist Party, calling for an immediate ceasefire and the start of negotiations. The All-Circles Self-Salvation and National Salvation Joint Association followed suit with its own proposals, and advised both sides to hold talks in Shanghai. Assemblies and National Assembly representatives from provinces and cities in North China, and the assemblies of Sichuan and Hubei provinces, have all issued similarly urgent appeals. We believe that the people of other provinces and cities will also rise up like a storm and shout out demands for a ceasefire. This is a glimmer of peace, and it is also the beginning of the real people speaking!

The President's Message said, "If peace can be realized, I will not be concerned about my personal advance or retreat, and I will only follow the will of the people." His frankness and sincerity are unanimously considered by domestic and foreign public opinion to be beyond doubt. The key to war or peace in the future, which is also the key to the people's fortune or misfortune, is indeed, as the Shanghai Municipal Assembly telegram said, truly dependent on a single thought of the gentlemen of the Communist Party. We believe that today is the time for the masters of the country to speak earnestly to the Communist Party.

After eight years of war, China should have been able to strive for construction in the peaceful atmosphere of broad daylight. But unfortunately, for the past three years, the entire China has been shrouded in gunpowder smoke, cannon fire, and clouds of sorrow and darkness, still under a low-pressure system! We common people are facing a great disaster, everyone is afraid of destruction, everyone is asking for survival. At this urgent time, how can we not cry out loudly and emit a resounding echo from the bottom of our hearts? The common people are the masters of the country, and the government is to serve the common people and make them happy. Therefore, regardless of whether the ruling party is elected by the people or obtains power through other methods, it must come up with the best possible measures in its work to truly meet the needs of the common people and realize immediate benefits. Only in this way can it gain the support of the entire population. Any political party that only deceives the people with empty propaganda and high-sounding rhetoric, but in practice uses force as a tool to seize power, exhausting the people and mobilizing troops, killing people and filling the fields, and giving the people endless suffering, is what we resolutely oppose.

Frankly speaking, the Chinese Communist Party claims to "liberate" the people, but its intention is to seize power. But whether it is "liberation" or seizure, it cannot but admit that the people are the masters of the country. Then, under the circumstances of continuous wars and frozen snowy weather, using "human waves" as tactics and treating the common people as straw dogs, such cruel massacres cannot be what the masters want to see. Look: seas of blood and mountains of corpses, scorched earth! Who does not have parents? Who does not have children? Partings of life and death, crying from hunger and cold, heartbreaking and tragic sights, we cannot bear to speak of! We believe that the gentlemen of the Communist Party certainly possess a conscience and love peace. Who does not want to be like us? Since the President has already sincerely advocated peace, why must the Communist Party fight to the end and inflict more suffering on the Chinese people?

Mencius said, "Calamities sent by Heaven may be avoided; but when we bring on calamities ourselves, it is impossible to live." We ask: Now that the door to peace has been opened, why should the masters stand idly by and let a few people act willfully and destroy our country?

The failure of the previous Political Consultative Conference was because the real masters of the country did not participate, did not speak, did not make a public judgment, and did not use their power to stop the use of force. If we want to realize peace now, both sides should respect the speech of the masters. Only the masters can decide everything and can make a public judgment on right and wrong.

The Atlantic Charter is the most important document of modern times and the foundation of human glory. It was proclaimed by the great political leaders of many countries, and it should be followed by billions of people in the future. The Atlantic Charter clearly proclaims to us that everyone has the right to determine their own way of life and the appropriate form of government they should adopt. The President's Message points out that as long as the peace negotiations do not harm the independence and integrity of the country, help the people recuperate and rest, do not violate the Constitution, guarantee the army, and allow the people to maintain their free way of life and current minimum standard of living, then he has no other demands. We believe that this has indeed opened the door to peace. If the Communist Party is also sincere, both sides should immediately issue orders to truly cease fire and have people's representatives and impartial international personnel conduct on-site inspections. At the same time, within the territory of the Republic of China, the most suitable place should be quickly selected (such as Shanghai), and representatives responsible for negotiations should be sent by both the government and the Communist Party. Under the fair observation of national people's representatives and international personnel, they should meet each other with sincerity and properly discuss a way to resolve all disputes. Everything should be based on the will of the people, and the points of contention that cannot be resolved should be ultimately decided by the public judgment of the people's representatives. From then on, we will cease warfare forever and engage in production and construction, so that the common people can live and work in peace and contentment. If that is still not possible, we can also appeal to the world peace organization - the United Nations - to arbitrate the disputes. This is also a reasonable way to resolve them peacefully.

We think: India and Pakistan can cease disputes, Jews and Arabs can cease fire, why can't we Chinese people stop the domestic war? Only the Chinese people can save the troubled China! Our fate must be decided by ourselves and saved by ourselves! We want the political parties that advocate war to quickly abandon the use of force! At the same time, we want to transform and innovate! The old and unreasonable things, we need to sanction and reform; the new and reasonable things, we are willing to accept and experience. We want to reject the totalitarian, autocratic, and enslaved life; we want to cherish the democratic, free, and modern life. Anyone who is unwilling to give peace to the people is the enemy of the people!

### Tragic Incident Occurs Near Luhu, Wujiang at Midnight; Lake-Shanghai Ferry Sinks; Over a Hundred Passengers Drown; Cause Possibly Overloading

[Our Suzhou Office, 4th] Not long after the Jiangya incident, a major shipwreck tragedy occurred near Luhu Township, under the jurisdiction of Wujiang County, last night. Due to the cold weather and cold water, more than one hundred passengers tragically drowned. It is reported that the Shenhu route passenger ferry of the D昌轮船局 (Dachang Steamboat Bureau) under the Pujiang Inland River Shipping Company sailed from Huzhou to Shanghai yesterday morning. When it arrived at Luhu Township, it was nearly 10 p.m. After passengers got on and off, it had been sailing for only a few minutes when the ship suddenly tilted and sank. Passengers woke up in shock from their sleep, but because it was dark and they could not distinguish directions, and because the ship sank too quickly, they did not have time to escape. As a result, of the more than two hundred people, only fifty-odd were rescued, and the rest were buried in the water. Afterwards, the steamboat bureau tried to keep the incident secret and prevent it from leaking out. The Wujiang County Government, upon receiving the report, has ordered a thorough investigation of the incident and is actively handling the aftermath. According to the rescued passengers, when the ship left Huzhou, in addition to being fully loaded with passengers, it was also loaded with more than ten pieces of local silk and more than forty 名 of rice. At Nanxun, another forty 石 of rice were added. Moreover, there were no winds or waves that night, and the waterway was not dangerous. Therefore, the cause of the shipwreck was actually overloading.

Then reveal the overall goals of the entire effort: (1) In the overall efforts of the military, political, and civilian sectors, we must continue to consolidate and expand the battle city, thoroughly implement the action program of the battle city, establish a battle system that combines life, production, and battle, and realize the four equalities of right and wrong, labor, life, and sacrifice, in order to lay the foundation for the success of the revival. (2) In the military, we must implement a streamlined army and complete a strong army that is sure to defend and sure to attack, using a blazing sea of fire to eliminate the Communist bandits' cruel "human waves." (3) In politics, everything must be for battle, and everything must support the front lines. Finally, he said, the Third Year of Revival is our most difficult year, and it is also the year to strive for victory.

### Reflection of Peace on the Front Line: National Army Soldiers Doubt the Sincerity of the Communists; A Communist Soldier Says He Misses Home

[United Press Correspondent, Ji Ang, Beiping, 4th] The concern for peace among the lower-ranking soldiers of both the Nationalists and Communists seems to be no less than that of the high-ranking officials. On the 4th, the reporter braved the cold to go to the front line outside Beiping City to talk with the National Army and entered the Communist area to chat with the Communist soldiers.

The reporter talked with a young National Army soldier in the freezing wind. The soldier pointed to the Communist defense line across the snow-covered fields and said: "The Communists say they want peace, and President Chiang has declared that the government wants peace. If both sides are sincere, they should reach an agreement immediately, because if it drags on for another year, the Chinese people will be finished." He then said: "But are the Communists really sincere? According to the farmers, the slogans posted by the Communists on the walls of the villages say: 'Down with Fu Zuoyi, and then there will be peace.' But everyone knows that General Fu is a good man and a good general. General Fu has gained more hope among the people than any other National Army leader. If the Communists want to talk about peace after overthrowing such a good man, what is their sincerity?" The reporter crossed the snow-covered fields and entered the Communist defense line. The first people he met were two Communist soldiers squatting by the roadside, basking in the sun. The earflaps of their leather caps covered their ears, and their light machine guns were placed on their laps. They did not stand up when they saw the reporter approaching, but only shouted, "Where are you going?" The reporter told them, "I am a foreign news reporter, and I came here to chat with you." They then took the reporter to a farmhouse by the roadside, where seven Communist soldiers were huddled around a fire to keep warm.

One of them asked the reporter: "Has peace come?"

They invited the reporter to sit on a bench, and the reporter asked them what they had heard about the peace talks. They said they had only heard that Nanjing was discussing the issue.

The reporter asked: "Is peace possible?"

Several people replied: "We don't know." One of them said: "I really hope for peace, because I have been fighting for seven years, and I really want to go home."

Another person asked me if there were any movie theaters in Beiping. He said that he hoped peace could come immediately, because he wanted to see a movie. Until now, he had only heard the word "movie."

Another older Communist soldier, possibly an officer, asked the reporter about the United States' attitude towards the establishment of a coalition government including the Communist Party. The reporter replied that he did not know and asked about the Soviet Union's attitude towards the establishment of a coalition government in China. One Communist soldier angrily replied: "The Chinese government is a matter for China, not for the Soviet Union."

When the reporter left, they saluted him. When the reporter returned to the National Army defense line and walked towards the city gate, a National Army officer smiled at the reporter.

### President Chiang's New Year's Day Address Explains the Meaning of Advocating Peace; Sun Ke's New Year's Day Broadcast Says Peace Requires Everyone's Efforts

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] President Chiang presided over the New Year's Day group worship ceremony on the morning of the 1st at 11:00 AM and delivered a brief speech, which stated: Recalling the revolutionary history of the past 37 years, we feel very ashamed and even more inspired by the spirit of our leader, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who led our party members in 40 years of arduous struggle when he was alive. Today, I have issued a New Year's Day message explaining the significance of advocating peace in order to alleviate the suffering of the people in the face of the temporary setbacks suffered by the current revolutionary cause, and clarifying that peace and nation-building is the consistent policy of the government. I have also listed the facts that the government has compromised and sought peace with the Communist Party over the past three years to let everyone know that my proposal for peace today is not because the government does not have the strength to continue fighting. It is precisely because we still have great combat power that we can advocate peace. Otherwise, without combat power, how can we talk about peace again? As the saying goes, you cannot have peace without being able to fight, which means that you can have peace only if you can fight. This is the reason why I am advocating peace today. We must know that the government's strength in military, political, and economic aspects is several times or even dozens of times greater than that of the Communist Party. Although the army has encountered many setbacks since the battles in the Northeast, it still has the advantage in terms of both quantity and quality. In particular, the air force and navy are beyond the ability of the Communist Party to compete. In addition, the foundation of politics and economy is also beyond the reach of the Communist Party. What is regrettable now is that some people in our government have been affected by the Communist Party's evil propaganda, and their minds have been shaken, almost losing confidence. Because they are spiritually threatened by the Communist Party, they only see the enemy's strength and do not see that they still have dozens of times more power than the enemy. Everyone knows that when our National Revolution first started in Guangdong, it only had two regiments of troops, but it finally unified the country and was later able to win the final victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan. Our government today has such a solid foundation and strong power. If we can restore the revolutionary spirit of that time, then what kind of bandit rebellion cannot be quelled? Therefore, our advocacy of peace today is not to avoid war and seek peace, but to be able to fight and to be able to have peace, leaving it to the Communist Party to choose. If the Communist Party is truly sincere in seeking peace, the government is willing to implement a peaceful policy of political resolution to alleviate the suffering of the people and preserve the vitality of the country. This is the most important point of my message today, which is "to plead for the people," and everyone must deeply understand it.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Executive Yuan President Sun broadcast the following full text on New Year's Day evening at the Central Broadcasting Station: "A new year begins, and everything is renewed." The difficult, war-torn year of the Republic of China 37 has passed, and the New Year's Day of the Republic of China 38 has arrived. At the beginning of this new year, all the people of the country naturally share the same heart and the same reason in praying for peace, stability, and happiness. The President also issued a message today, declaring his determination to strive for peace and expressing the government's sincerity in seeking peace. I believe that this is not only good news for the entire Chinese people, but also the most desirable news for friends from all over the world to hear.

Recalling three years ago, at the beginning of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, because the people needed to recuperate, because the country needed to actively build, and because the various parties had a common understanding of the needs of the country and the people, we once gathered representatives from all parties and social elites together to hold a Political Consultative Conference. After three weeks of efforts, and thanks to the good offices of President Truman's special envoy, Mr. Marshall, we also agreed on a program for peaceful nation-building and concrete plans to resolve various disputes. If we had been able to implement the various plans in a timely manner at that time, I ask you, how prosperous should China be today, and how happy should the Chinese people be today! Unfortunately, the various parties failed to completely abandon their petty interests at that time, and the people of the whole country also failed to make their best efforts to promote the success of this peace movement, which led to the recurrence of war and the devastation of life. In the past three years, not only has the loss of people's lives and property been incalculable, but even the glimmer of hope that the country had after eight years of resistance against Japan has almost been completely destroyed.

Today, our head of state, President Chiang, has once again announced his determination to seek peace for the country and has stated that as long as peace can be achieved, his personal advancement and retreat will not be of concern, but will only be in accordance with the public opinion of the people. President Chiang's statement is so open and aboveboard. This is truly a new hope for the future of the country and a new opportunity for the people of the whole country. I personally have never dared to lag behind in my efforts to seek peace for the country. Now, at this time, I have assumed the important responsibility of the President of the Executive Yuan. I will surely uphold my long-standing aspirations for peace and make the greatest efforts to achieve peace. However, peace cannot be achieved by the efforts of a few people alone. It must be achieved by the joint efforts of everyone in order to achieve this common goal. Therefore, I hope:

First,

The soldiers of the National Army on the front line must hold their positions with the bravest and strongest will. They must not be disturbed by the government's announcement of its intention for peace. Recently, the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, the Taiyuan Campaign, and the Pingjin Campaign have turned the tide of the war thanks to the loyalty and sacrifice of the officers and soldiers on the front line. The whole country admires them. Now, when the government is striving for peace, it must rely on the officers and soldiers on the front line to make the greatest and final efforts to guarantee the success of peace.

Second,

Peace is a matter for both sides. Peace can only be achieved if both sides have the sincerity and determination to seek peace. Today, the government's intention to seek peace has been clearly stated to the world. It is hoped that the people of the whole country will also deeply recognize that peace is a major issue concerning their own survival and will rise up to make organized efforts so that the Communist Party will also understand the trend of public opinion and take the interests of the country and the people as the most important thing, immediately stop military actions, and, on the premise of safeguarding the country's independence and integrity and maintaining the people's freedom, jointly seek the thorough realization of peaceful unification and democratic constitutionalism to relieve the people of their current suffering.

Dear compatriots, your contributions to the country and the sacrifices you have made for the nation during the eight years of resistance against Japan have reached the highest and greatest limits. However, after eight years of resistance against Japan, you still have to endure the pain of conscription, requisitioning of grain, and price fluctuations every day. The government also feels this pain as if it were cutting our own flesh. The government is now considering thoroughly reforming the methods of conscription and requisitioning of grain in the near future to reduce the suffering of the people in the vast rural areas. It is also seeking the most effective methods to stabilize prices, hoping to provide the people with a more stable guarantee of life. In short, the government will spare no effort to do everything that can alleviate the suffering of the people and increase the welfare of the people, so that the government and the people can unite in spirit and in fact, work together to overcome the current difficulties, and jointly create a bright, prosperous, and happy future.

### CPC Party Headquarters Commemoration Week, President Sun Attends and Reports

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters held the first commemoration week of the 38th year on the morning of the 3rd. President Chiang presided over the meeting, and President Sun attended and reported. Sun said: He was appointed by the President to be responsible for the Executive Yuan without any preparation, but he could not refuse. He has been at the Executive Yuan for two weeks, and everything is in the process of organization and planning. Therefore, there are no concrete decisions on the policies of the Executive Yuan in the future, so he cannot report on the policy guidelines. Sun continued: The 38th year has now begun.

"The plan for the year lies in the spring." We should review where our past mistakes lie and why we have encountered all kinds of setbacks and failures, and strive to correct them. In particular, we should lead the rural areas so that the vast human and material resources can be used for combat. Sun concluded: The President issued a message on New Year's Day, announcing internally and externally that the use of force was a last resort and expressing the government's willingness to restore peace. If the Communist Party can realize this and also express its willingness to seek peace, then peace is not impossible. The political circles in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as the media at home and abroad, have been deeply impressed by the President's message, acknowledging that the government has opened the door to peace. Now it depends on the Communist Party's attitude and whether it can understand the government's desire for peace and seek a peaceful solution.

### New Leaders of the U.S. Congress Clearly State that They Will Maintain a Bipartisan Foreign Policy; Truman Scheduled to Deliver State of the Union Address Today

[United States Information Service, Washington, 3rd] Two leaders of the U.S. Congress stated today that they support continuing to maintain a bipartisan foreign policy. At the first meeting of the new House of Representatives today, Democratic Representative Rayburn, who was elected Speaker of the House, urged the continued implementation of bipartisan diplomacy. He delivered a brief speech stating, "You will inevitably disagree on many domestic issues, but on all international issues, I hope there will be greater consistency." Democratic Senator Connally, who will serve as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declared that he will work to promote a bipartisan foreign policy. This policy is the one that he and Vandenberg worked together to implement. Connally said, "In this time of global turbulence, we must have an American foreign policy, not a Republican or Democratic foreign policy." He assured that the committee he leads will first pay attention to the new recovery plan for Western Europe and military assistance to Western Europe. He believes that the most important thing at present is to continue the European Recovery Program for another fifteen months.

[United Press, Washington, 4th] President Truman will submit a plan to Congress on the 4th for high taxes and huge expenditures. This plan relies heavily on Speaker of the House Rayburn to promote its implementation in the tradition of Roosevelt. When Truman's annual Federal State of the Union address is read to a joint session of Congress, it will outline the general outline of the plan. Rayburn has been given great power and will work to ensure that the bill is approved by the House. In 1910, Speaker Cannon's power was too great, and he was almost dictatorial. The House amended the House Rules to strip him of most of his power. Truman's address recommends focusing on four major domestic issues: taxation, labor legislation, economic regulation, and human rights legislation.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 3rd] The 81st U.S. Congress, under Democratic control, opened here at noon today. President Truman will attend Congress on Wednesday to present the Federal State of the Union Address, and on Friday, he will present a special address on economic issues. On Monday of next week, he will present the budget address for this year. Around January 20, the President will present his fourth address. According to informed sources, this address will be a detailed outline of foreign policy and will state the United States' support for the Atlantic Treaty. Even if the President does not present the full text of the draft treaty, he will present the outline of the treaty. In the address, the President may request a budget of $43 billion, which is the largest budget in peacetime. Informed sources said that the President will make the following requests: (1) increase taxes; (2) authorize the control and distribution of various scarce raw materials; (3) increase the minimum wage from 40 cents per hour to 75 cents per hour; (4) increase social security pensions by 50%; (5) extend export controls that expire on June 30. Political figures believe that the result of the new Congress will have a major impact on the world, especially on the progress of the Cold War between the East and West blocs.

### President Truman Gains the Upper Hand for the First Time; House Rules of Procedure Revised; Powers of the Rules Committee Greatly Reduced; Rayburn and McKellar Elected as Speakers of the House and Senate

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 3rd] Democratic leader Rayburn was elected Speaker of the House with a majority of 255 votes at the beginning of the new Congress today, succeeding former Speaker Martin. Democratic Senator McKellar defeated Republican Speaker candidate Vandenberg by a vote of 50 to 40 and was elected Speaker of the Senate.

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] The new U.S. Congress opened today, and the government urged the House to adopt new rules of procedure to facilitate the passage of government bills. The new rules were immediately passed by a voice vote of 275 to 142, and the opposition of the Republicans and some Democratic members was ineffective. Members of Congress believe that this test is a test of President Truman's expanded power over Congress since the election in November last year. In the past, the Rules Committee had considerable power to shelve bills, not submitting them to the House for a vote, and had the right to decide which bills should be discussed by the House. In the future, if the Rules Committee does not submit a bill passed by the Legislative Committee to the House for discussion within 21 days, the chairman of the Legislative Committee can directly submit it to the House, and with the consent of the majority of representatives, the House can discuss it. Republican members said that recognizing the chairman of the Legislative Committee's power would allow Speaker of the House Rayburn to manipulate the agenda of the General Assembly. Both houses of Congress then announced a recess until the 5th, when President Truman will personally attend and deliver an address.

### U.S. Major Parties Designate Candidates for Congressional Leadership

[United States Information Service, Washington, 2nd] Senator Lucas has been elected as the Democratic leader of the Senate. Lucas will take office on January 20. The original Democratic leader of the Senate, Barkley, will take office as Vice President on that day and, in accordance with the U.S. Constitution, will assume the position of Chairman of the Senate. Lucas will also serve as Chairman of the Senate Democratic Conference and Chairman of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee. Representative McCormack succeeds Rayburn as Democratic leader of the House.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 3rd] Republican senators today elected Cain of Wyoming as the party's leader in the Senate. Hay, who is a representative of the forward-looking members of the Republican Party, defeated William Nolan, another candidate representing the liberal members of the Republican Party. Republican senators also elected Taft as the candidate for Chairman of the Executive Committee of the party.

### Chairman of the U.S. Farmers' Association Reads Forrestal

Advocates that a Civilian Should Head the Department of Defense

[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd, Associated Press] Patton, Chairman of the National Farmers' Association of the United States, suggested that Graham, former U.S. representative on the United Nations Indonesian Mediation Committee, succeed Forrestal as Secretary of Defense. Patton severely criticized Forrestal's report on military unification issued last week. He pointed out that Forrestal requested the enactment of legislation to enable military institutions to decide on war on their own without the approval of Congress. He said that Forrestal held the position of Secretary of Defense,

### British Imperial Chief of Staff Shilling Promoted to Marshal

[Associated Press, London, 4th] The War Office announced on the 4th that Sir Shilling, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, has been promoted to Marshal. Smith, 57, served as Commander of the British 14th Army in Burma from 1943 until the Japanese surrender. In October of this year, after General Montgomery was appointed as the permanent chairman of the Western European Union Defense Committee, Smith succeeded Montgomery as Chief of the Imperial General Staff.

### Security Council to Reconvene Tomorrow; Expected to First Discuss Indonesian Issue; Both Dutch and Indonesian Representatives Have Arrived in New York

[United Press, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 2nd] The Dutch representative to the United Nations, Mr. van Roijen, flew to the United States today to attend the Security Council. Mr. van Roijen expects the Security Council to first discuss the Indonesian issue when it reconvenes on January 6th.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 3rd] The chief Indonesian representative to the United Nations, Mr. Palar, declared upon arriving in New York from Paris today: The Indonesian dispute is not merely a dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands, but also a dispute between the Netherlands and the Security Council. Mr. Palar expressed disappointment with the outcome of the recent Security Council meeting in Paris to discuss the Indonesian situation, stating that he will re-submit the case at the New York meeting, hoping to obtain a solution. He added that this case is like a political football, kicked around by the great powers. The chief Dutch representative to the Security Council, namely the Dutch Ambassador to Canada, Mr. van Roijen, also arrived in New York after Mr. Palar. Mr. van Roijen called the remarks of the Indonesian representative laughable, comparing the leaders of the Indonesian Republic to the leaders of Prussia in the past, who ruled the country by force and military action.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 2nd] According to authoritative sources, the United States' position on the Indonesian issue remains unchanged. In response to much speculation in the newspapers regarding the recent measures taken by the Security Council in Paris, this official statement is made to provide clarification. Authoritative sources here stated that the United States has not changed its position. This statement is of an informal nature, as the Indonesian issue is still on the Security Council's agenda, and the Council is scheduled to reconvene in the United States in January. The United States' position was clarified by Mr. Jessup in the Security Council on December 22nd. Mr. Jessup stated: "The United States government cannot determine whether the Netherlands has consistently or intentionally undermined the possibility of reopening negotiations under the mediation committee."

### Japan Plans to Increase Exports; Revises Five-Year Economic Stabilization Plan; Seventy-Five Zaibatsu Firms Released from Restrictions

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] According to reliable sources, the Japanese government plans to revise its five-year economic stabilization plan, hoping that by 1953, annual exports can reach US$2 billion, an increase of over US$500 million compared to the original target. This new economic stabilization plan will focus on export trade rather than the recovery of domestic industry, as Japan urgently needs foreign exchange, especially US dollars.

[Another Dispatch] Officials announced that 75 of the Japanese zaibatsu industrial and commercial companies listed as subject to restrictions have been released. These 75 companies, which were under government supervision since the Japanese surrender due to their connections with the zaibatsu, can now resume their free and independent operations, just like other private enterprises.

### Dutch Military Issues Ceasefire Order for Java

Fighting in Sumatra Still Ongoing

[United Press, Batavia, 4th] Well-informed sources said today that Dutch forces will issue a ceasefire order as soon as they occupy the last major city in Sumatra, Pangkalan Brandan. Meanwhile, the Dutch representative today informed the United Nations Mediation Committee that a ceasefire order had been issued in Java on the 2nd, and they welcome the United Nations observer group to inspect the Dutch-occupied areas on the ground.

[United Press, Batavia, 3rd] Dutch forces today have almost completely occupied all major Indonesian cities in Sumatra. Their troops advancing towards Pangkalan Brandan encountered no resistance along the way, and Indonesian forces in the Bagan Siapiapi area were also driven out. According to a Dutch military communique, since the start of police action on December 19th, we have suffered a total of 66 deaths and 172 injuries.

[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 3rd] The Dutch representative today sent a letter to the United Nations Mediation Committee and the consular corps, stating that all possible facilities will be provided to the supervisory personnel for this peace agreement to investigate the truth of the situation since December 12th of last year. The letter also included the full text of the ceasefire order issued by the Dutch authorities, but did not mention the Security Council's order to release the Prime Minister of the Republic, Sukarno, and other leaders of the Republic. A spokesperson for the Mediation Committee said that the committee is discussing with the consular corps how to dispatch military supervisory personnel to the newly occupied areas of the Netherlands within days. These supervisory personnel are currently gathering in Batavia and Bandung, awaiting departure to carry out their work.

### Indonesian Guerrillas Launch Offensive Against Dutch Forces

According to Dutch reports, 500 guerrillas attacked a rubber plantation near Pontianak, but were repelled.

### Dutch Prime Minister Drees Flies to Batavia by Special Plane

India Permits the Plane to Land in India

[Associated Press, Amsterdam, 4th] Dutch Prime Minister Drees flew to Batavia by special KLM flight on the morning of the 4th. The route he took was not disclosed. Before his departure, Drees told reporters that the Netherlands' Indonesian policy has two major goals: "One is to organize a fully transitional government that can represent all of Indonesia, and the other is to organize the United States of Indonesia, to which we will later transfer sovereignty. Therefore, elections must be held in Indonesia to decide on certain points." He also said that the initial intention of this trip was to "discuss the local political situation." He added that the Dutch government has always sought to reach an agreement with Indonesia through personal contact.

[United Press, New Delhi, 4th] India today permitted a KLM aircraft carrying Dutch Prime Minister Drees to land in India en route to Indonesia. According to a government spokesman, Pakistan will also grant the same permission to the Dutch request, but it is unknown when Drees will depart. India and Pakistan had previously banned Dutch aircraft from passing through their territory due to the Dutch military action in Indonesia.

### Domestic Unrest in Burma Prevents Sending Troops to Indonesia

Statement Issued by Burmese Government Spokesman

[United Press, Rangoon, 4th] A government spokesman said today that the Burmese government has not approved sending troops to Indonesia to assist in the fight against Dutch forces. The situation in Burma also does not allow a large amount of military supplies to be placed in private hands. Although former Prime Minister Ba Maw advocated sending troops, Burma needs to eliminate domestic lawlessness, and the existing military supplies are insufficient and still need to be purchased from abroad for the defense forces. Regarding the Indonesian issue, the actions Burma should take can be decided by the Asian Fourteen Nations Conference initiated by India.

### Asian Fourteen Nations Conference to be Held in India on the 16th

[Our News] Cairo, 4th Broadcast from New York: The Secretary of the Arab League, Mr. Azzam, told the Indian Ambassador that he believes the Arab governments will accept India's invitation to attend the meeting to discuss the Indonesian issue. The meeting is scheduled to be held in New Delhi on January 16th. Mr. Azzam said that preventing imperialism is the fundamental goal of the Arab League, and added that the Arab states were the first to recognize Indonesia's independence.

[United Press, New Delhi, 3rd] The Indian government today invited the Philippines to attend the Asian countries conference to be held in Allahabad in two weeks to discuss joint action to deal with the Indonesian issue.

Officials hope that Australia and New Zealand can also participate.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 2nd] Prime Minister Nehru of India has scheduled an international conference in New Delhi to discuss the situation caused by the Dutch aggression against the Republic of Indonesia. It is learned that the governments of China and Egypt have replied, agreeing to send representatives to participate.

[Associated Press, Manila, 4th] Prime Minister Nehru of India's call for a Southeast Asian conference to discuss the Dutch-Indonesian war has been unanimously and enthusiastically supported by the government, parliament, and media here. The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs stated that it has not yet received an invitation to this conference, but the department strongly implied that the Philippines welcomes the establishment of a regional organization to help resolve disputes within the Southeast Asian region. Foreign Ministry officials said that this matter may be raised at the cabinet meeting on the 5th, and a further statement will be issued when the Philippines actually receives the invitation.

[Agence France-Presse, Canberra, 3rd] The Australian government has received a telegram from Indian Prime Minister Nehru inviting it to participate in the Asian countries conference to study the Indonesian issue. It is learned that Prime Minister Chifley will consider this request as soon as possible. Foreign affairs observers expect that even if the Australian government does not send formal representatives to attend, it will send personnel to attend as observers, as part of Australia's policy of close friendship with Asian countries. Political circles expect that if the United Nations cannot force the Dutch troops to retreat to the original designated border lines, Australia is willing to consult with Asian countries on regional action.

### Ambassador Smith Expresses Doubt About the Claim of a Split in the Soviet Politburo; Smith Submits Resignation to Truman

[United States Information Service, Washington, 3rd] U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith told reporters after meeting with President Truman today that he had requested to be relieved of his duties in Moscow, but the President did not take any action on this request and hoped to discuss this matter with Smith again in the future. Smith reiterated his desire to be relieved of his duties in Moscow so that he could reside in his own country, as he has been away from his country for seven years, four years serving in the military and three years serving as U.S. Ambassador to Moscow. When reporters asked about the possibility of a split in the Soviet Politburo, Smith replied, "As far as we know, there has never been a split in the Politburo. It is possible to have various differing opinions before a policy decision is made, but there has never been a split in opinion after that." When asked to comment on President Truman's statement that some Soviet leaders are eager to establish friendly relations with the United States, Smith replied that he guessed that there are people in the Soviet Union who favor taking a more moderate path, but it is difficult to determine who these people are.

### U.S. Supreme Court Again Refuses to Hear Appeal of Japanese War Criminals

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 3rd] The Supreme Court today, by a vote of six to one, refused to hear the appeal filed by five Japanese war criminals sentenced to imprisonment, and upheld the court's decision on December 10th of last year, that the Supreme Court has no authority to interfere with the decision made by the Tokyo International Military Tribunal.

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] The U.S. Supreme Court on the 3rd again refused to interfere with the judgment of the Far East Military Tribunal against Japanese war criminals. The court refused to hear the applications of six Japanese war criminals without any comment. The rejected applications were submitted by Koichi Kido, Shigemasa Shimataro, Sato and four others (sentenced to life imprisonment), former Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu (sentenced to 20 years imprisonment), and Kenji Doihara, who has already been executed.

### Yoshida Predicts General Election on the 23rd; Liberal Democratic Party Will Win a Major Victory; Will Occupy More Than 200 Seats in Parliament

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 4th] Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida predicted on the 4th that his Liberal Democratic Party would win a major victory in the general election on the 23rd and occupy a majority of the 466 seats in the House of Representatives. The party only had 150 seats in the recently dissolved parliament. To win a majority, 234 members of the party must be elected.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 4th] As cabinet members rush to electoral districts to prepare for the January 23rd general election, only staff members are left to hold the fort in the Japanese cabinet. Prime Minister Yoshida left Tokyo by car on the morning of the 4th to begin a long speaking tour in western Japan for the Liberal Democratic Party. Yoshida estimates that the party will occupy more than 200 of the 466 seats in the new House of Representatives. (The Liberal Democratic Party occupied about 150 seats in the dissolved old House of Representatives.) The chairman of the Socialist Party, former Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama, also left Tokyo for a speaking tour in northern Honshu. As the Socialist Party has not responded to MacArthur's order prohibiting strikes by civil servants, which has caused some labor groups to become estranged, the party will have to make every effort to increase its seats in the new House of Representatives (in the old House of Representatives, the Socialist Party occupied about 100 seats). As of the evening of the 3rd, a total of 1,343 people have registered to participate in the election, of which 842 are new faces participating in the election for the first time, indicating that all parties hope to inject "new blood." Although the old House of Representatives was notorious for corruption cases, 423 former members of the House of Representatives continue to participate in the election.

### U.S. Issues Serious Warning to Israel; Do Not Invade Arab Territory; Result of British Request for U.S. Intervention

[United Press, London, 3rd] Responsible sources said today that the United States has notified Israel that if Jewish forces invade neighboring Arab countries, they will lose U.S. diplomatic recognition. This special action came after the British government issued a warning.

According to British sources, Britain has military alliance relations with Arab countries and may be drawn into the Middle East war. The U.S. Embassy declined to comment on this. British Ambassador to the United States Franks was scheduled to meet with President Truman today, but the meeting was cancelled. The White House did not provide any explanation for this, nor did it schedule another meeting. Previously, Franks met with U.S. Acting Secretary of State Lovett last Friday, asking the U.S. government to use its influence to prevent Jewish forces from crossing the border, otherwise Britain, due to its military alliance relations, may be forced to assist its Arab allies. The United States immediately sent a note to the Israeli government, condemning the Jewish forces for crossing the border and invading neighboring countries. The Israeli government replied to the U.S. State Department's warning today, but its contents have not been announced. It is reported that Britain is quite shocked by the appearance of Israeli forces near the Palestinian-Egyptian border, which is only 120 miles from the Suez Canal. Britain will not allow any invading troops to approach the Suez Canal, and has mutual assistance obligations to Egypt and Outer Jordan and Iraq. If this treaty is invoked, Britain must take action.

### Holy Land War Still Not Over

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 4th] An Israeli spokesman said today that Jewish forces clashed with Iraqi forces in the Sharon Valley region of central Israel. The battle lasted for two hours, with casualties on both sides, and the situation is tense again.

[United Press, Jerusalem, 2nd] The Holy City was bombed tonight, with three bombs landing in the Jewish area, injuring two people.

### One Million German Prisoners of War Not Released; U.S., Britain, and France Question the Soviet Union; TASS Rejects Western Notes

[Associated Press, London, 3rd] The United States, Britain, and France asked the Soviet Union on the 3rd to explain how many German prisoners of war are still being detained and why they have not been released by midnight at the end of last year in accordance with the formal agreement between the Allies. It was announced that the Western Allies submitted this request separately to the Soviet Foreign Ministry in Moscow through their embassies in the Soviet Union. The contents of the note will not be released until the 5th. However, it is learned that the note mentioned the publicly available information that the Soviet Union is still detaining nearly one million Germans, and there are many more who may not have been counted. It is also rumored that the Soviet Union is still detaining hundreds of thousands of Japanese prisoners of war in Siberia. The four powers agreed at the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Moscow on April 23, 1947, to release all German prisoners of war by midnight on December 31, 1947. The Soviet Union at that time admitted to detaining 890,532 Germans, France detained 641,483, Britain detained 435,295, and the United States detained 16,103. But one of the great mysteries after the war is what happened to the three million Germans who disappeared in the Soviet Union. After the Moscow agreement was signed, the Western Allies have released all prisoners of war except for war criminals and other ordinary criminals. Therefore, a spokesperson for the French Foreign Ministry denied the Soviet claim that France is still detaining 400,000 Germans.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 4th] TASS scoffed at the claim by Britain and the United States on the 4th that the Soviet Union is still detaining many German prisoners of war. The agency said that the absolute majority of Soviet-German prisoners of war have been repatriated to Germany, and denounced Britain and the United States for detaining a large number of prisoners of war under the pretext that they voluntarily stayed in the two countries and were freely employed. TASS also denied that the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Moscow last year made a positive decision on the repatriation issue, and claimed that the Foreign Ministers' Conference transferred this proposal to the Allied Control Council for Germany. The agency said that Britain and France vetoed this proposal in the Allied Control Council. TASS also stated that although the "absolute majority" of German prisoners of war have been repatriated, "the repatriation of the remaining prisoners of war is being carried out in accordance with the plan adopted by the Soviet government and will be completed in 1949." TASS further accused that "Hitler had exiled 50,000 Soviet citizens to Germany during the war, who were detained by Britain and France after the war and are currently being held in concentration camps in the British, American, and French occupied zones of Germany."

### Closing Ceremony of the Senate General Assembly Today; Lively Discussion on the Competition of Gold and Silver; Resolution to Request Continued Operation at the Original Price Without Restrictions

[Our News] The eighth general assembly of the Municipal Senate held its fourth meeting at the Senate Hall on Tanggu Road at 3:30 pm yesterday. Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, and 137 senators attended, and Mayor Wu and more than 20 directors of municipal bureaus attended as observers. After the Secretariat completed its report, Speaker Pan presided over the discussion of proposals on finance, civil affairs, police affairs, public works, social affairs, health, regulations, and other aspects. The meeting adjourned at about 7:00 pm. The general assembly was originally scheduled to close yesterday, but because of the heated discussion on the issue of gold exchange in the social affairs proposals, senators spoke enthusiastically and opinions differed greatly, lasting for quite a long time, causing the discussion of proposals to not be completed as scheduled. At about 6:00 pm, the assembly unanimously passed a resolution to extend the general assembly for one day. Today, the assembly will continue to discuss temporary proposals and hold the closing ceremony.

The following is a record of the discussion and resolutions of various proposals yesterday: In the social affairs proposals, the issue of gold exchange aroused heated discussion. More than ten people, including Zhang Zhongyuan, Zhou Lianze, Wang Yansong, Zhou Xuexiang, Jiang Haoran, Shui Xiangyun, Tong Xingbai, Zhang Zhihan, and Zhang Yiqu, spoke successively. Finally, because the five proposals in the social affairs section were of the same nature, it was decided to discuss them together. The reasons for each case are as follows: (1) Recently, commodity prices in this city have soared, which has greatly affected the lives of citizens. The Senate should immediately write to the municipal government authorities to promptly devise a way to strictly curb it to ensure people's livelihood. (2) The method of gold and silver exchange has been changed repeatedly, which has fluctuated finance and stimulated commodity prices. The government should immediately telegraph the central government to handle it solemnly, and do not change it easily, resulting in the loss of currency trust. (3) It is proposed to ask the central government to change the method of gold exchange, and mint and issue gold yuan to circulate in the market to strengthen currency trust and stabilize commodity prices. (4) It is proposed to suggest that the authorities allow workers to deposit and exchange gold and silver to avoid partiality. (5) In order to ensure the stability of currency value, stabilize commodity prices, and completely eliminate the black market for gold and panic buying, the Senate should urgently telegraph the Ministry of Finance to earnestly implement unrestricted gold exchange to benefit people's livelihood. As a result of the combined discussion of the above five cases, the following resolutions were made: The Senate telegraphed the central government to continue to implement the policy of unrestricted exchange of gold and silver at the original price, and asked the government to sell a large amount of materials to strengthen currency trust.

### Manufacturers Fleeing; Workers Allowed to Continue Work

In addition, there were two other proposals in the social affairs section as follows: (1) Please approve industrial loans quickly, coordinate labor and management, increase production to save the lives of industrial and commercial people and stabilize the society. Resolution: Passed. The methods are as follows: A. The loan should be based on production capacity, and the factory's machinery and real estate should be included as collateral. B. When manufacturers flee with capital and disregard the lives of workers, the factory's labor union may directly request an industrial loan to continue operations, supervised and operated by the relevant authorities. C. Ask the municipal government to forward it to the Central Bank for adoption and implementation as soon as possible. (2) Coal places such as cafes and restaurants with dance floors and music equipment in the city are requested to order dance hall licenses to be uniform and increase tax revenue. Resolution: Passed.

### Those with Money Should Contribute to Ensure Shanghai's Safety; Those Fleeing in Panic Ordered to Pay a Defense Donation of 50,000

Legal Regulations Aspect (1) Regarding police reporting of corruption in the distribution of allocated goods, the circumstances should be carefully examined, and appropriate measures should be taken based on the severity of the case. Cases should not be rashly transferred to the court to protect human rights. Resolution: This case is reserved. (2) Regarding the proposal to levy a special relief donation on passengers traveling to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and foreign countries, Resolution: Approved. A letter will be sent to the municipal government to instruct the Relief Committee to promptly formulate implementation measures. (3) Zhang Hanting, the owner of Jinliyuan Shipping, acted bravely and rescued many people. A request has been made to consult with the municipal government to submit a commendation case. Resolution: This case has already been approved by the General Assembly, and an honorary citizen medal has been awarded. (4) It is proposed to appoint personnel to form an administrative research committee to contribute the research findings to the government at any time. Resolution: Proposed to be reserved. (5) During extraordinary times, all levels of government personnel should exercise self-restraint, and the government should handle civilian personnel according to military law. Resolution: Proposed to be reserved. (6) It is suggested that the central government abolish the Materials Supply Bureau and supply all remaining materials to the military to encourage and comfort them. Resolution: Proposed to be reserved. (7) Resolutely implement the principle that those with money should contribute to ensure the safety of Shanghai. Resolution: Passed. The measures are as follows: 1. Order the donation of funds in lieu of self-defense firearms and ammunition. 2. Or order the donation of a certain number of uniforms for the self-defense forces. 3. Or order the donation of a certain amount of refugee relief funds or consolation money for the soldiers at the front. 4. Those who flee in panic are ordered to pay a local defense donation of 50,000 Gold Yuan. 5. The amount of donations for items one to three above can be determined with reference to the previous special relief donation precedents. The more, the better. 6. The houses of those who have fled Shanghai will be taken over by the municipal government or local community organizations for emergency use. 7. The municipal government will handle all of the above items by extraordinary means. (8) Please send a letter to the municipal government to stop the implementation of Article 5 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Crimes Against Food Management, which restricts the storage of food for self-consumption by households and public and private institutions and organizations, in order to encourage grain storage.

### The Sanbei Mingxing Vessel to Sail to Ningbo for the First Time Tomorrow, Carrying Four Coffins of Yu Qiaqing and Others

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai-Ningbo route has the highest number of passengers. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company originally had the Jiangjing and Jiangya vessels, which sailed daily between Shanghai and Ningbo, except on Sundays. Since the Jiangya vessel accident, the company had no vessels to dispatch, so the Jiangjing vessel sailed alone, once every other day. Although the Ping An Company's Dahua vessel and the Taichangxiang Jiangsu vessel have been converted to sail the Shanghai-Ningbo route on a dedicated schedule, they do not carry many passengers, so passengers still cannot be fully transported. The Sanbei Shipping Company originally had the Ningxing vessel dedicated to sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo before the war, but it was unable to resume sailing after the victory due to a lack of ships. Recently, seeing the crowded passengers on the route, it is planned to transfer the Mingxing vessel to the Shanghai-Ningbo route. The vessel is the company's most excellent passenger vessel, originally sailing the Shanghai-Hankou route, with a gross tonnage of 2,300 tons, capable of loading 1,600 tons, and carrying 2,000 passengers. It is scheduled to sail to Ningbo for the first time tomorrow. However, it will not carry passengers for the first time, but will only transport two coffins of the late General Manager Yu Qiaqing and his wife and one coffin of the Teng family, as well as one coffin declared by the Xin Gong Customs Broker, for a total of four coffins. After the coffins of Yu Qiao Lao and his wife arrive in Ningbo, they will be transported by special train to Sanbei Longshan for burial.

### Various Organizations Issue Telegrams, Supporting the President's Advocacy of Peace, Calling on the CCP to Lay Down Their Weapons as Soon as Possible

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the President's New Year's Day proclamation, the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce, the General Association, the Municipal Industrial Association, the Municipal Education Association, the Municipal Women's Association, the Kuomintang Municipal Party Department, the Democratic Socialist Party Municipal Party Department, and the Youth Party Municipal Party Department have all responded and issued telegrams, calling on the people of the country to support President Chiang's advocacy of peace. The original telegram is as follows: "All provincial and municipal senates, organizations, newspapers, news agencies, and the people of the country, as a whole: Since the War of Resistance against Japan and the suppression of the rebellion, wars have been continuous for eleven years. The turmoil of war has caused suffering to the people. Our President Chiang Kai-shek, in order to protect the national lifeline and cherish the lives of the people, deeply hopes that the war will not be prolonged, so he issued a proclamation on New Year's Day, advocating peace, which is kind and sincere. The gate of peace has been opened, and the opportunity to turn misfortune into good fortune has arrived. Whether the overall situation in the future is war or peace, and whether the people suffer or prosper, all depends on the CCP's thoughts. If the CCP can feel the President's sincerity and value the lives of the people over political views, then reopening peace talks, discussing national affairs together, turning swords into plowshares, eliminating hostility, and turning into auspiciousness is as easy as turning one's hand. If they still stubbornly adhere to their prejudices and insist on rebellion, then the responsibility for the war in the future will be entirely on the CCP. It will not only fail to live up to the President's sincerity in advocating peace and our people's desire for peace, but it will also be criticized by friendly nations around the world who love peace and become a sinner of all ages and a public enemy of the people of the country. It is hoped that all our compatriots will rise up to support the President's great call and call on the CCP to wake up as soon as possible, lay down their weapons, and immediately make peace talks. Then the country will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate. Shanghai Municipal General Chamber of Commerce, General Association, Municipal Industrial Association, Municipal Education Association, Municipal Women's Association, Kuomintang Municipal Party Department, Democratic Socialist Party Municipal Party Department, Youth Party Municipal Party Department (Zi) (Jiang) together."

According to another report, before the above organizations issued the telegram, the Municipal Senate first telegraphed on that day, calling for peace. The Senate passed three telegrams on the evening of the 2nd during the New Year's dinner, one to the President and the central government, one to the Chinese Communist Party, and one to all provinces and cities, calling on the Communist Party to agree to a ceasefire and listen to both sides sending representatives to have an open and honest discussion.

Various Circles Respond, General Assembly to Be Held Tomorrow

### Shanghai Legislative Councilors' Association Held a Symposium Yesterday, Exchanging Views on the Situation and Agreeing to Resume Peace Talks

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Legislative Councilors' Association held a symposium last night to exchange views on the situation. More than a dozen people attended, chaired by Fei Xia. President Tong Guanxian also took time to attend, but left midway due to business before the end of the meeting. It is learned that the legislative councilors who participated in the talks unanimously agreed to resume peace talks and expressed their deep admiration for the head of state's sincerity in seeking domestic peace without regard to personal interests. However, at the same time, they believe that it is difficult to resume peace talks at this time and that "peace is more difficult than war" in terms of the actual situation. Regarding the way of conducting peace, the legislative councilors spoke very enthusiastically, and their opinions can be roughly divided into three categories: In view of the long-term hatred between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in the past, direct consultation is obviously difficult. In order to achieve the success of peace talks, people from all walks of life outside the two parties should form a third party to mediate. Today, not only does the government have the sincerity of peace, but there is no lack of people inside the Communist Party who advocate peace. At the same time, the people under the rule of both sides are eager for peace, so if the power of the people can be actively exerted today, although the process of peace will be difficult, it will eventually be successful. Today's international situation also urgently needs peace, and China's civil war is a hindrance to international coordination. Relevant countries also hope that our country's internal disputes can turn swords into plowshares. Therefore, in the process of striving for peace, international forces should also be used. According to a legislative councilor who attended the meeting, the talks were entirely for the purpose of exchanging views. Similar meetings will continue to be held, and once a conclusion is reached, there may be specific opinions made public to the society.

### Tragic Accident on the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway on New Year's Day, Car Overturns on the Way to a Wedding Banquet, Fourteen Dead

[Report from this newspaper] A tragic car accident occurred on the Shanghai-Wuxi highway on the [blank]th, resulting in more than ten deaths and injuries. The car, a No. 03 transportation vehicle from the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, was borrowed by Bao Xiaopeng, the director of the Second Garage of the Public Bus Company. Bao, who was newly married, took advantage of the holiday to return to his hometown in Taicang to hold a wedding banquet. The car was borrowed by Bao to pick up and drop off relatives and friends. In addition to Bao himself, the car also contained his bride Xu Xianzhao, Bao's sister Xiangyun, Gu Zhenbai and his wife, the chief secretary of the Public Utilities Bureau, Li Jiyin, a staff member of the secretariat, as well as Bao's Jiaotong University classmate Feng Xianyao, and about forty others. The car was driven by Jiang Chunhua, a worker from the Tiantong Road Engineering Factory, and the coppersmith Wei Wenjie accompanied the car for repairs. After the car departed from Tiantong Road at 9 AM, it arrived at a wooden bridge half a kilometer away from Gelong Town at around 10:50 AM. The bridge deck broke, causing the car to overturn into the river. When nearby villagers heard the sound and rushed to the scene, they managed to break the car windows that were exposed above the water and rescue some passengers. However, fourteen of them died due to drowning after being submerged for too long. The fourteen people who died were the groom Bao Xiaopeng, the bride Xu Xianzhao, Gu Zhenbai's wife Wang Fengyi, Secretariat staff member Li Jiyin, Bao's sister Xiangyun (four years old, employed at the Shanghai Telephone Bureau), and Feng Xianyao, the manager of China Hardware Company.

The remains of the above fourteen victims, with the exception of Feng Xianyao who was transported to Shanghai for encoffining, have all been encoffined in their hometown of Taicang. The driver and the coppersmith have been detained at the Taicang Police Department for questioning.

The deceased groom, Bao Xiaopeng, was only 30 years old. After graduating from Jiaotong University, he was sent by the government to the United States to specialize in the steel industry. He had returned to the country for less than a year. The bride, Xu Xianzhao, was a graduate of the Agricultural College of Central University and was 17 years old.

### Chaotic Paradise

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng of this Newspaper

[Report from this newspaper in Hangzhou on the 1st] In Hangzhou, the city of paradise, the most distinctive wartime scene is probably the railway station. The station is chaotic and crowded, giving the impression of a city already devastated by war. The station authorities blame everything on the war, resulting in passengers boarding without tickets, carriages packed like sardines, and uncertain train schedules. Delays of 30 to 40 minutes are considered normal, and waiting three to four hours is not uncommon.

Since the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign and the tense situation, this reporter has traveled back and forth on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line many times, and many friends also frequently travel between Shanghai and Hangzhou. They are all puzzled as to why train delays have become routine. According to people at the station, the biggest reason is that Hangzhou has no spare tracks. Military trains and evacuation trains often occupy all the tracks, making it impossible to coordinate the entry and exit of vehicles. Therefore, trains from Shanghai to Hangzhou stop at Linping, Jianqiao, and Liangshanmen to wait for the tracks to clear before entering the city station. This reason seems sufficient on the surface, but upon closer inspection, it is also somewhat unreasonable. If evacuation trains arrive at the city station, they can stop near the city station. If military trains arrive at the city station, they can be discussed with the commanders to be moved quickly. Moreover, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has spent a great deal of effort designing the Zhegan Railway for both routes, with Gengshanmen as the starting point for those going to Shanghai and Nanxingqiao as the starting point for those going to Jiangxi. Now, such a practice has had minimal effect on the starting points of Liangshanmen and Nanxingqiao. Furthermore, there are not many military trains, and evacuation trains do not occupy too much space.

Traffic Chaos and Suffering for Passengers

Wang Zuomin, the director of the Lushan Administration, came from Nanjing and asked this reporter why the railway traffic was so chaotic. Wang Yaming, the chairman of the Wuhan Daily News, took the train from Shanghai and did not arrive at the city station until after 6 o'clock. This reporter came to Hangzhou from Shanghai on the 30th of last year and waited for an hour and a half for a train at Gengshanmen. The passengers waiting for the train to Shanghai at the station stood in the wind and rain, their clothes soaked, and their packages and luggage immersed in the muddy water. Yet, no one at the station told the passengers when the train would arrive, leaving them to suffer even before disaster struck.

All difficulties can be overcome with human effort. Both lines should strive for the sake of millions of passengers. The Nanxingqiao Station on the Zhegan Railway is naturally not as orderly as desired, but we must remember that it was completed under difficult and arduous circumstances, and we ultimately express our sympathy and hope.

Special Evacuation Trains Run Regularly

It is said that the Zhegan Railway transported 26,398 family members of various central government agencies from the capital back to their hometowns from December 11th to December 25th. The most on one day was over a thousand, and the least on one day was over a hundred. The agencies evacuated included the Presidential Office, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, the Examination Yuan, the Control Yuan, the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Land Administration, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Finance, the United Logistics Headquarters, the Engineer School, the Infantry School, the Artillery School, the Central Party Headquarters, the High Court, the Postal Remittance and Savings Bureau, the Telecommunications Administration, the Central News Agency, and others. The fares paid were calculated according to the fares before December 6th, which was one-sixth of the current fares. Regarding the allocation of trains, from December 11th to December 21st, the railway prepared five trains, and special trains 311, 312, and 313 were regularly run to transport the family members of the evacuated agencies to Hengyang from Hangzhou. From December 22nd, in order to avoid the need for family members returning to their hometowns to transfer trains in Hangzhou, through trains 255 and 101 from Beijing to Hengyang and Beijing to Zhuzhou were operated, with ten trains prepared by the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, five by the Zhegan Railway, and two by the Jinpu Railway, for a total of seventeen trains. Regarding the ticket exchange method: each unit sent one representative to exchange tickets collectively, and exchanged second-class and third-class tickets separately according to the Beijing-issued ticket exchange certificates and the trains they were taking. From this, it is clear that the uncertain train schedules today are due more to human reasons than natural reasons.

We sincerely hope that the railway can use all its wisdom and ability to quickly restore order and avoid unnecessary suffering for travelers.

Auction Houses Opening One After Another

Another scene of wartime in Hangzhou is the proliferation of auction houses. Since the victory, Hangzhou has not had an auction house. The history of auction houses in Hangzhou can be said to begin today. Since one auction house opened, many more have followed. The reason for the establishment of these auction houses is that many people in the area want to evacuate, so they auction off unnecessary items. Some people passing through Hangzhou feel strapped for cash, so they also auction off their belongings. Others are people living in this paradise who find life difficult, so they auction off some of their possessions. Compared to that, the number of people evacuating from Hangzhou is still in the minority, while those staying or passing through Hangzhou make up the majority. The largest number of people, however, are those in Hangzhou who find it difficult to make a living. These various reasons, these various items, all contain pages of sad history. In addition, the refugee students have left, and there are refugees wandering the streets. During the day, they beg along the streets in broken languages. At night, they huddle under the eaves, enduring the harsh winter.

### Three Female Students in Lanzhou Flee to Jiuquan Fearing Exams

[Report from this newspaper in Lanzhou on the 1st] With the winter vacation approaching, schools at all levels in Lanzhou are holding final exams. Among them, three young girls from the Municipal Lanyuan Experimental Elementary School, Lu Xiaozhen, Geng Jianhua, and Wang Shuqin, are only twelve or thirteen years old. On the eve of the final exams (the 28th), they ran away together. Their parents and the school reported the matter to the police station and began searching separately. On the 30th, a resident named Xie Yicun in Shilitian, a western suburb, reported that three female students were seen carrying bags and heading west. The police station immediately dispatched personnel by car to pursue them, catching up with them in Anning Fort, 29 kilometers from the city. When asked why they ran away and where they were going, they said it was because they were afraid of failing the exams and planned to go to school in Jiuquan. The police officers then took them back and handed them over to their parents for proper discipline. This matter, though small, raises a significant issue for our educators.

### Jiangxi Expands Security Teams and Levies Special Taxes on Cotton and Other Items

[Report from this newspaper in Nanchang on the 1st] The Jiangxi Provincial Campaign for National Reconstruction Mobilization Committee, in order to ensure funding for the expansion of Jiangxi's security teams, has decided to expand the collection of special self-defense taxes. In addition to the existing taxes on timber exports, special grain taxes, and special donations, it will also levy special taxes on eight additional items: cotton, cotton yarn, cigarette imports, coal, local tobacco leaves, salt, rice and grain exports, and freight surcharges. The collection of these special taxes will be organized by the Department of Finance, entrusted to the Salt Administration, transportation agencies, and county tax collection offices, with a supervisory committee set up to audit and verify the collection. Additionally, the special tax business previously collected by the Central China Suppression Headquarters in Jiujiang, Ruichang, and other five counties in northern Jiangxi will also be handed over to the provincial government for organization.

### Strange Beast Captured in Wushan: Fox Head, Human Body

[Report from this newspaper in Lanzhou on the 1st] According to a carpenter named Han from Tanggezhen, Wushan, Gansu: On December 19th of last year, a hunter in Nangou, Tanggezhen, captured a strange beast in a deep ditch while hunting. This beast has a fox's head and a human body and can walk upright. Other than being unable to speak, all other parts of its body are no different from a human. It is said that the beast is about the height of a seven or eight-year-old child when standing up. Its entire body lacks the fine hair of animals. It is fed potatoes, grains, etc., and has been living peacefully to this day, becoming a temporary spectacle.

### Tung Oil in Eastern Zhejiang

— Reporter Jiang Feng of This Newspaper

[Report from this newspaper in Jinhua on the 1st] Tung oil is one of China's four major exports. In its golden age, it topped China's total exports and occupied a large and stable market abroad. Tung oil production areas in China are widely distributed, covering sixteen provinces, including Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Hubei, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Fujian, Guangdong, Kang, Yunnan, Gansu, and Jiangsu. Zhejiang's tung oil production ranks fourth among the country's oil-producing provinces, with an annual output of about 500,000 piculs. Zhejiang's tung oil production areas are mostly in the counties commonly known as eastern Zhejiang, including the old Jin, Qu, Yan, Chu, Tai, and Wen counties.

Before the Anti-Japanese War, Zhejiang Province actively promoted tung tree planting, and annual output increased year by year. At that time, the highest price per picul was about 25 yuan, equivalent to about 600 catties of rice. Therefore, farmers were very interested in planting tung trees, and the planting area expanded very rapidly. At that time, the agricultural administration authorities in Zhejiang Province paid close attention to the promotion of tung trees. As early as the 24th year of the Republic of China, the Zhejiang Provincial Agriculture and Forestry Management Committee was established and set up an office for wasteland reclamation in Shili, Qu County. The office cultivated tung trees simultaneously in the suburbs of Jiangshan, the Lutaishan area of Sheng County, and other places as a promotion demonstration, with remarkable results.

During the later stages of the Anti-Japanese War, when the flames of war spread to the Pacific, the export of tung oil was hopeless, and the price plummeted, with each picul of tung oil only equivalent to about 150 catties of rice. Coupled with the wartime shortage of food and the high price of grain, farmers mostly cleared tung trees and switched to planting grain crops, greatly reducing tung oil production to about a quarter of pre-war levels.

After the victory, "Zhe Oil," which was once famous in the international market, showed little improvement. Although, in the early days of recovery, the general farmers believed that the good times for tung oil were about to return, and some replanted tung trees, the price of tung oil remained stagnant, and the farmers' interest in planting tung trees gradually waned again, and the future of "Zhe Oil" became increasingly bleak. The reasons for this, in addition to the fact that the price of tung oil fell compared to other commodities, also include: (1) Tung oil areas that had fallen into enemy hands during the war suffered severe logging and losses, making recovery difficult. (2) Domestic warfare continued for years, and tung trees grew more slowly than other crops, reducing farmers' interest in planting. (3) Diseases and insect pests of tung trees were rampant. (4) Tung farmers all used indigenous methods to make oil, resulting in impure oil quality and making it difficult to export. (5) Both tung farmers and oil merchants felt that they lacked funds and could not carry out large-scale production and sales.

Not long ago, this reporter visited several major tung oil-producing counties in eastern Zhejiang, such as Lanxi, Chun'an, Qu County, Jiangshan, and Jiande. These products have not been able to restore their pre-war glory, and production is also struggling to recover. Farmers mostly use outdated production methods, the lowest quality land, and ancient tools to complete the planting of tung trees and the production of tung oil.

In the eastern Zhejiang area, usually after the Frost's Descent, farmers begin to transport tung seeds to nearby oil pressing workshops, exchanging a small amount of tung seeds for tung oil or oil cake. Sometimes they also directly sell them to workshops or other small oil merchants at a discount.

Oil pressing workshops are mostly small in scale, using wooden presses for oil extraction, with simple structures and limited production. The workshops collect small amounts of tung seeds, accumulating enough to process, and then go through the following five steps to become "crude oil."

(1) Cleaning the Seeds: The tung seeds received by the workshops often contain dirt and other debris. Manual sorting is often used, or wind power is used to winnow away the dirt and debris.

(2) Drying the Seeds: Workshops mostly use brick-built pits as stoves, covering them with bamboo curtains to dry the tung seeds. The tung seeds are stacked on the bamboo curtains to a height of about five inches, and roasted over a slow fire, with constant turning to prevent the seeds from burning. The size and number of pits depend on the size of the workshop. However, each pit is mostly tended by one worker, and the size of the fire, the number of turns, and the roasting time are all determined by the worker's experience. Usually, it takes one and a half to two days to roast. After roasting, the seeds are sifted to remove broken and burnt husks.

(3) Crushing: The dried tung seeds are poured into a circular stone trough, two to three piculs at a time, and crushed by a large stone wheel pulled by an ox. If the amount of tung seeds is small, they may also be crushed by hand in a stone mortar.

(4) Steaming: The crushed tung seeds are placed in a steamer for ten minutes to soften them and make them easier to stick together to form a cake. Then, four iron rings are stacked on a cake board to form a cylindrical shape. The bottom and inside of the cylinder are covered with bundles of straw, with one end exposed outside the ring. The steamed tung seed powder is poured onto the straw, and the cake maker stands on the hot powder, using his feet to press it down, and using his feet to tread the straw around the iron ring to tightly wrap it around the cake.

(5) Oil Extraction: When entering the press, the iron rings on both sides of the cake are removed, and then the cake trees are placed in the press chamber, ten to fifteen at a time. Then, manpower is used to hold the ram and inject water into the press cavity, squeezing the oil cake horizontally to compress it tightly and slowly release the oil.

The workshops place the pressed tung oil separately into oil baskets and transport it to distribution and transshipment centers such as Lanxi, Quzhou, and Wenzhou, where merchants transport it to Shanghai for sale.

Generally speaking, the tung trees planted in the eastern Zhejiang area are mostly two-year tung trees, and the natural conditions, such as climate and soil, are suitable for tung planting. The tung oil produced is light in color and of excellent quality. As long as the rebellion is quelled and foreign sales are smooth, it is foreseeable that "Zhe Oil" will continue to dominate the international market.

### Guizhou Provincial Geological Survey Institute to Conduct Mineral Deposit Survey in Two Phases, Focusing on the Southeastern Region

[Our Dispatch from Guiyang] [Daily Aviation News] In order to develop the province's mining industry, the Guizhou Provincial authorities are now planning to start exploring underground resources to promote economic construction and pioneer the discovery of hidden resources. According to the Guizhou Provincial Geological Survey Institute, the province is extremely rich in underground resources. During the Anti-Japanese War, the aluminum mine in Xiuwen County was discovered, with the best quality in the country. The iron ore in Guanyin Mountain, Shuicheng, has the largest reserves, unmatched by other provinces in the southwest. There are countless other valuable mineral products. However, it is regrettable that they cannot be developed at once due to limited manpower and financial resources. As for the institute's recent survey and exploration work, it has not been fully launched due to economic constraints. In recent years, it has only conducted partial surveys of some virgin areas. The future plan is to complete a preliminary and systematic survey of the province's geological and mineral resources this year, focusing on the southeastern region of the province. According to the institute's recent discoveries, there are gold, iron, zinc, antimony, mercury, coal, saltpeter, clay, pyrite, and other minerals in the six counties of Rongjiang, Liping, Jinping, Sandu, Jianhe, and Congjiang, with abundant reserves and a very wide area. Among them, the most noteworthy are antimony in Rongjiang, asbestos and magnetite in Congjiang, which are extremely precious. Moreover, the area bordering Guangxi has a wide distribution of igneous and metamorphic rocks, which may contain "atomic energy" minerals. The institute has recently scheduled to conduct detailed surveys in two phases this year, and it is expected to complete the survey work in Congjiang, Rongjiang, and Sandu counties within March and April. The lower phase will survey Liping, Jianhe, and other places in September and October. The total survey cost has been budgeted at 59,200 gold yuan, which will be allocated from the province's construction special funds to start work as soon as possible.

### Spit Out What You Swallowed, the Technology of Deposit and Exchange is Not Thorough, A Gold Rush is Sweeping Across Ningxia, Ma Hongkui is Making the People Suffer

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Ping Liang

[Our Dispatch from Ningxia on the 1st] The Central Bank of Ningxia handles the deposit and exchange of gold. Because transportation is inconvenient, gold must be transferred from Lanzhou to Ningxia, so it only started on December 9th, 13 days later than the scheduled start date. According to the bank's announcement, the first batch of gold delivered was over 190 taels. However, due to incomplete procedures, the gold was completely exhausted within a few days of arrival, and the general public could not exchange it. As a result, the Central Bank's deposit and exchange of gold aroused suspicion in public opinion. The crowd was angry, shouted injustice, and set off a gold rush.

After Chairman Ma Hongkui learned about it, he made a painful statement, saying: "Since the issuance of the gold yuan, many patriots have taken out gold and silver to exchange for gold yuan, giving it warm support. Unfortunately, the country's fortune is not good. After a few days, the black market came suddenly, prices rose, and the social finance became more and more insecure. When the President returned to Beijing from the Northeast, he deeply regretted the losses suffered by the people who exchanged gold and silver. Embracing the idea of 'taking from the people and using for the people,' he allowed the people to deposit and exchange gold and silver. When the country heard the news, confidence in the gold yuan greatly increased. The Central Bank of our province has shipped more than 190 taels of gold this time. According to the procedures, it should have been announced in the newspaper first, and detailed deposit and exchange methods should be published. According to the situation, people who initially exchanged gold and silver for gold yuan should have priority in deposit and exchange. Unexpectedly, as soon as the gold arrived, they secretly kept it secret, the people in the bank exchanged it first, then they perfunctorily did it, and then the financial community exchanged it, and finally the sign was quietly hidden. When the people found out and asked, they said the gold was exchanged. What is this? The President's economic policy for the people was given priority to the bank staff to distribute the spoils. Is there anything more unfair in the world than this? It is regrettable! I (Ma referred to himself) saw that no one could deposit and exchange, so I sent someone to the Central Bank to inquire who had exchanged it? The bank said that no one could see the account without the order of the head office, and it seemed that outsiders suspected that the bank had malpractices, and it was not without reason."

Chairman Ma continued to criticize the bank's bureaucratic work, saying: "The country's financial fluctuations are like this, and the people's confidence in the gold yuan is not strong. However, the bank, which is responsible for stabilizing finance, is profiteering. It's really outrageous! At the same time, it is incomprehensible that local agencies always can't get the remittance notice from the central agencies for eight or ten days. When asked, the Central Bank says that they have not received it. May I ask if the notice from the local agencies can be received, but the notice from the Central Bank cannot be received. What is the reason? And every time it's late, is there no one time it's early? Furthermore, the receiving agencies always say that the money remitted by local agencies to Beijing and Shanghai can only be withdrawn after eight or ten days, which is really incomprehensible. Some people say that the bank delays the payment of the remittance to people to earn daily interest. I (Ma refers to himself) didn't believe it very much before, but now it seems that it is difficult to say!"

Finally, Chairman Ma said with great emotion: "The President is working hard for the country and the people, but as soon as the order is issued, the implementing agencies, the middle-level staff, give discounts at every level, and the order is completely changed. This is not just a phenomenon unique to the deposit and exchange of gold. Thinking of this, I can't help but complain for the people!"

Then, as a result of inquiries from relevant parties to the Central Bank, the Central Bank produced a registration form for the exchange of gold, on which the names and addresses of the depositors were checked and found to be mostly non-existent, so that the general public identified that the Central Bank had the suspicion of making up names for fraud. However, Manager Cheng Jiapeng of the bank had another explanation for the reporter. He said: "According to the original order of the head office, the deposit and exchange of gold started on November 26, but at that time the gold had not arrived, so we temporarily handled the registration procedures. After the depositors paid the money, they were given a slip, and they could take the gold when the gold was shipped. On the 26th, the announcement sign for the deposit and exchange of gold was posted, but no one asked about it all day. This bank was afraid that the head office would think that the postponement was Zhu Ban, and in order to promote it, I (Cheng Jiapeng referred to himself) and Feng Zhiwu, the chief of the business department, each deposited and exchanged five qian. As for the deposit and exchange procedures, the head office did not give detailed and standard, such as who should exchange, or what kind of registration procedures should be stipulated. Therefore, it was very chaotic when it was opened, and anyone could deposit and exchange. In order to be cautious, we also stipulated a kind of registration form, so that each depositor could fill it out by himself, and there was no guarantee. However, after the fact, the registered names and addresses were mostly fabricated. This was really a point that this bank could not prevent at that time, and it did not consider it at all.

At this point, Manager Cheng said: "Please spit out what you swallowed!" The 46 taels of gold deposited and exchanged by the banks in the city have all been returned and temporarily stored in the Central Bank. If there is an order, other depositors with a basis can also be recovered, but the list of unclaimed names is now being investigated as much as possible.

In order to thoroughly investigate who are the people who fabricated names for deposit and exchange, and to quell public anger, the authorities specially ordered the military law office to step up the investigation. Now it has not yet reached the stage where the truth is revealed, but someone has revealed clues, and the mystery will definitely be revealed soon.

### Abundant Arrivals from All Sides, Rice Market Weakened, Flour Soared, Grain and Oil Prices Rose

The rice market opened red yesterday, but the price declined slightly, because the weather was sunny and the arrival of goods was very strong. The price of rice in the production area was slightly lower during the holiday, so the price quoted by the cargo owner was also low. The initial opening decreased by 40 to 50 yuan. The rice shops in the central city turned smoothly, and the price slightly increased, but the closing price was still 30 to 40 yuan lower than last year. The white japonica rice in the south city was 630 yuan, a decrease of 30 yuan. Early rice fell by 25 yuan, and the sales of light white yuan were still active, slightly lower by 10 yuan. The white japonica rice in the north city opened at 630 yuan, a decrease of 25 yuan, and early thin rice and Yangxian rice each fell by more than 20 yuan. A total of 19,384 shi arrived in the north and south cities yesterday.

Flour

Soared very vigorously. Cargo owners said that the interest rate for three days during the holiday was very high, and they all raised prices. In addition, there was very little stock in the store, and there was a lot of replenishment on the market, so the rise was fierce. The old car opened at 315 yuan, and rose straight to 337 yuan at the close, a surge of 65 yuan compared with last year. The retail sales of the warship flour were strong, and the closing price was 335 yuan, a surge of 72 yuan. The red bee, Tongcheng, and miscellaneous brand flours all went out of 300, and the large bag of bran rose by nearly 40 yuan.

Grains

Rose very greatly. Due to the patronage of the customers, the sales were very smooth, and the prices rose in unison. The initial opening of soybeans was relatively flat, but after the customers were involved, they finally saw a price increase of 100 yuan. The northern gang strongly absorbed corn, and the rise was very fierce. Chongming corn was 630 yuan, a surge of about 40%. The opening of red grain was not much, and the price rose by 70 yuan. Mung beans also rose sharply, and the flour mills were active, rising by about 50 to 60 yuan. Sesame rose by 130 to 140 yuan, and peanuts were taken by the Guanggang, rising by 200 to 300 yuan.

Edible Oil

The rise was fierce. At the initial opening, the cargo owners added a lot of interest for the three days of the holiday, so they raised prices very vigorously. Later, due to the strong sales in the street, the rise became more and more fierce. Soybean oil opened at 2,600 yuan, the highest was 2,900 yuan, and the closing price was 2,800 yuan, a rise of 700 yuan compared with last year, reaching more than 30%. Raw vegetable oil was as high as 2,700 yuan, and closed at 2,600 yuan, also a rise of 700 yuan. Jitou Sheng oil closed at 2,900 yuan. Soybean cake followed the rise of about 40 yuan.

### Last Year's Export Settlement Reached 170 Million US Dollars

According to the Export Control Commission, the amount of foreign exchange settlement in Shanghai last year was as follows: January, 9,398,000 US dollars; February, 8,687,000 US dollars; March, 9,230,000 US dollars; April, 8,018,000 US dollars; May, 12,593,000 US dollars; June, 15,011,000 US dollars; July, 14,933,000 US dollars; August, 17,205,000 US dollars; September, 17,224,000 US dollars; October, 14,892,000 US dollars; November, 20,029,000 US dollars; and December, preliminary statistics of 24,990,000 US dollars, totaling 173,210,000 US dollars. Among them, April was the lowest and December was the highest. Looking at the whole year, the situation of export settlement began to improve from June, because the export settlement certificate has been implemented, which is beneficial to exports. However, it declined again in October, because after the currency change, the price of domestic export materials rose, and the exchange rate of gold yuan against foreign exchange became too high, so export settlement shrank. In November and December, due to the implementation of the Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificate, exports were greatly stimulated, and the amount of foreign exchange settlement was more than 20 million US dollars, breaking the previous record. It is generally expected that if peace is realized this year and transportation is smooth, the export situation in Shanghai will be more optimistic.

### Ministry of Finance Sets Implementation Measures for Silver and Money Industries to Pay Deposit Reserves

According to the Silver and Money Association, the implementation measures for silver and money firms to pay deposit guarantee reserves have been approved by the Ministry of Finance, as follows:

(1) The reserve that should be paid for the ordinary deposits and savings deposits received by firms and villages should be uniformly renamed "guarantee reserve" in accordance with the provisions of the Banking Law.

(2) The ratio of deposit guarantee reserves for commercial banks and savings banks in various places is temporarily set at 15% for current deposits and 10% for time deposits.

(3) The ratio of deposit guarantee reserves for industrial banks should be verified after adjusting business in accordance with the law and determining the nature. At present, they will be temporarily paid according to the above standards of commercial banks.

(4) The ratio of deposit guarantee reserves paid by provincial, county, and municipal banks shall be temporarily handled in accordance with the provisions of industrial banks in the Banking Law, and the ratio shall be temporarily set at 12% for current deposits and 8% for time deposits.

(5) Silver and money firms pay deposit guarantee reserves in accordance with the provisions of the Banking Law to offset them with public debt treasury bonds. Various banks in various places may be allocated public debt treasury bonds to offset the payment, and the amount is not limited. As for the valuation of bonds, national currency bonds shall be calculated at 70% of the face value. Foreign currency bonds shall be calculated at 50% of the publicly announced foreign exchange market price on the date of payment or adjustment.

(6) The adjustment of guarantee reserves shall still be done once a month as usual. The guarantee reserve for previous savings deposits was adjusted once every three months and should be changed to once a month.

### The Price of Woolen Fabrics is High and Sales are Sluggish

The opening price of woolen fabrics in the market yesterday was mostly the same as the closing price of last year. Except for overcoats, the prices of all other woolen fabrics remained high. Double cat Biji was quoted at 600 yuan, China Textile at 525 yuan, mixed-color tweed at 650 yuan to 850 yuan, piece-dyed tweed at 450 yuan to 600 yuan, riding breeches Tweeds at 600 yuan to 850 yuan, long-pile velvet at 700 yuan to 1,000 yuan, and navy blue at 425 yuan. The sales in the market were sluggish, and the transaction turned silent. It is said that the average price of each commodity soared by two and a half times in the week from the 22nd to the 28th of last month, and the public's purchasing power has been greatly weakened.

### Survey of the Enamel Industry by the Municipal Industrial Technology Association

According to the Municipal Industrial Association Technical Committee, there are 18 enamel factories in the city, with a total of 2,091 workers. There are 35 enamel kilns in operation, 13 powder kilns, and 4 rotary kilns. Among them, Huafeng and Yifeng are the largest, each with 5 enamel kilns in operation, but Huafeng's equipment is newer. The next is Yisheng Factory, with 3 kilns in operation, and Zhonghua, Jiuxin, Zhufeng, Taifeng, Jinlong, Jinxing, Xinhua, and Shunfeng Factories each have 2 kilns in operation. The next are Weida, Minfeng, China Guangda, Huaye, Huacheng, Lixing, and Hongfu Factories, each with one kiln in operation. Lixing was established last year, and Hongfu started operation at the beginning of this year. China Guangda Factory is currently merging the equipment of Jiufeng Factory, and its production will double in the future. The monthly output of each factory, if calculated in terms of enamel washbasins, spittoons, various plates, pots, bowls, cups, etc., is about 500,000 to 600,000 pieces. Enamel plates are 70,000 square feet. The monthly requirement is 620 tons of 28 to 3030 iron sheets, 45 tons of Chilean nitrate, 55 tons of soda ash, 130 tons of borax, 400 tons of quartz powder, feldspar powder, fluorite powder, and cryolite powder, 730 tons of diesel oil, of which more than 70% are imported raw materials. Recently, due to the weak purchasing power in Shanghai, poor freight transport in North China and the Yangtze River, and the fact that the foreign exchange rate in various parts of Southeast Asia is less than eight times higher than the "8.19" base price, while the cost has risen more than ten times, making it almost impossible to sell abroad. Therefore, all factories have difficulty selling goods and have to reduce factory stocks. The recent wholesale price is ten times the "8.19" base price, while wages and raw materials have risen to more than fifteen times.

### Barter Debt to Japan Reaches 8 Million US Dollars

According to the Central Trust Bureau, the total amount of debt owed by the bureau on behalf of the country for barter trade with Japan has reached 8 million US dollars. The origin of this debt is not due to poor management or unequal exchange. After the victory, the machinery and equipment needed by our country were all ordered through a single order from the Allied Command and delivered on schedule. During this period, most of the materials in our country that had value and could be exchanged for more foreign exchange were transported to other countries, and there were very few exports to Japan. Even if there were exports, most of them were materials that could not be exchanged for foreign exchange in other countries. Therefore, the result was inevitable debt. However, this kind of debt can be repaid immediately.

There were more than ten thousand spectators and philanthropists, making it a grand occasion. The ticket revenue from ticket sales totaled over 188,000 yuan. Mayor Wu attended the opening ceremony and kicked off the game. Deputy Director Wang Zhaohuai of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau presided over the auction of the charity ball. The Shanghai Electric Combination provided live broadcast of the match, and the atmosphere at the stadium was quite enthusiastic. As a result of the competition, West United narrowly defeated China United 3-2. West United led 1-0 in the first half. The lineups of the two teams were as follows:

Auction of Charity Ball

During the break, Deputy Director Wang Zhaohuai presided over the auction of the charity ball, starting from 100 gold yuan. After fierce competition, the "old fan" Cheng Bo'an finally won the bid with the highest price of 50,000 yuan. Cheng Bo'an then donated it again, and it was re-auctioned. Finally, a Mr. Dong bought it for 50,000 yuan in the name of an anonymous person, to relieve the refugees. His sincerity is admirable.

China United's Defeat

It was freezing cold. This charity match, which was supposed to be a highlight of the season, was not very exciting. China United never showed good teamwork. Especially the weakness of right winger Lin Dianyi, lost many opportunities, and the ball stopped every time it reached him. Gao Xiuqing was short, and the strength of the right wing was greatly weakened. The left wing, Jin Lusheng, did not get the ball much. Xiao Luo was the most outstanding, and his several sprints were very impressive. Center back Gao Baozheng was the strongest. The West United's fullbacks and center backs were very good, and the right winger Panlai was especially likeable. China United's loss was due to the penalty kick in the first place. The second goal in the second half bounced off the post and went in, which could not be helped. The third goal was because the center back was too far forward, and the fullbacks could not save it. In the second half, China United launched a fierce counterattack, but could not score. They knew the game was over.

Penalty Kick

The game started at 2:35 PM. The referee was He Shouheng, and the linesmen were Chen Jiqun and Hui Bo. Mayor Wu entered the stadium and shook hands with the players of the Chinese and Western teams respectively, and then kicked the ball, kicking off the battle. West United got the ball from Mayor Wu and was about to attack, but China United caught up. However, the right winger Lin Dianyi was too weak and repeatedly lost good opportunities. At nine minutes, West United forward Gebi was injured and left the field. Just then, "Little Blondie" Roberts Stoff arrived and substituted, increasing the attack. At 29 minutes, Yan Shixin prevented Little Blondie from attacking and caused trouble in the penalty area. He was sentenced to a penalty kick, which was successfully taken by Gelinasi. West United then took a 1-0 lead in the first half.

One Goal Defeated

Changing sides and fighting again, China United sent Chen Qin into the field, replacing Lin Dianyi. West United, Shan Toshi entered the field replacing A. Oliveira. West United passed the ball for offense. After ten minutes of melee, Santo received a cross from Roberts Stoff and shot close to the goal, hitting the goal post and bouncing in, 2-0. China United counterattacked, and in less than a minute, Qu Yongfu lived up to expectations and pulled back a goal with a beautiful pose. However, at 25 minutes, Roberts Stoff dribbled past Wu Qixiang and shot close to the goal. Xu Fusheng caught the ball and lost it again, rolling into the net, 3-1, West United won another city. At 31 minutes, Gao Xiuqing received a pass from Chen Qin and rushed into the net with the ball. Until the end of the time, West United narrowly defeated China United 3-2.

### Inheritance Analysis Question

Zhang Sheng asks: My late father had three brothers, who had already separated their residences, but the ancestral property has not yet been distributed. When they separated, they made three written agreements, each holding one. Later, my father passed away in 1934. At that time, I was young, and the agreement was kept by my older sister. In 1935, my older sister went abroad due to some matters, which caused the agreement to be lost. I also joined the Air Force in 1936. Later, I moved west with the army, and only returned to Shanghai last year. In the past fifteen years, I have not returned to my hometown due to studying in Shanghai and serving with the army. Now I intend to return to my hometown to propose the distribution of property. I do not know what procedures should be followed. If my family raises objections, how should I deal with it? If this property has been sold by my family, what procedures should be followed to recover it? Is there any legal basis for the above situations? Please give a detailed answer.
