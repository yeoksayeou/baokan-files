### Considering the CCP's Eight Conditions: Government Discusses and Drafts Peace Proposal; Ten-Member Committee's Drafting Work Awaits

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The ten-member committee designated by Acting President Li, including Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, and Zhang Qun, to study peace proposals has been exchanging opinions separately in recent days, but has not yet entered the drafting stage. Part of the content of the peace proposal is based on studying the eight conditions proposed by the CCP and putting forward counter-proposals. It is understood that the most difficult issues to resolve are "war criminals" and "army reorganization." The issue of "abolishing traitorous treaties" will be easier to resolve, as both sides can abolish any treaty deemed to have compromised sovereignty. Two members of the ten-member committee have left Nanjing, so the work of drafting a proposal has not reached the final stage. The Executive Yuan's discussion meeting on the 4th also touched on the peace issue, expressing determination and sincerity for peace and committing to remove obstacles to peace with all efforts. According to the Nanjing Evening News on the 4th, the government's peace negotiation representatives have been re-appointed as Shao Lizi, Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhong Tianxin, and Wu Zhongxin, but this has not yet been confirmed.

[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The government's ten-member special committee responsible for drafting a peace plan has reached an agreement on counter-proposals to the first four of Mao Zedong's eight conditions and is continuing to meet to determine the government's response to the other four conditions. The counter-proposals for the first four are: (1) The CCP must make concessions on "punishing war criminals"; (2) The constitution can be amended; (3) The National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan can be dissolved; (4) Reorganize the armies of both sides on the principle of equality.

[Reuters, Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] People here generally believe that the main problem for peace in China is only to find an appropriate formula for "saving face." Politically, everyone acknowledges that China's civil war is over. Observers believe that the main obstacle to finding a solution is the extremist elements within both sides. Before acceptable answers are obtained to the thorny issues of punishing war criminals and reorganizing the army, there may still be bloodshed. It is heard that the central authorities are quietly urging former President Chiang to go abroad, and military forces are gradually being reduced under the guise of financial difficulties. Most Kuomintang members expect that the Communist Party will gain a controlling position in the future coalition government, but they still hope to gain a balanced control in the administrative organs of the provinces under the Kuomintang government. Therefore, the government is busy reorganizing personnel in various provinces to maintain higher administrative efficiency, while also transferring greater power to local authorities. Regardless of the content of the final agreement, it is believed that it will be accepted by most areas controlled by the government.

[Reuters, Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Zhang Zhizhong and Wu Zhongxin, two members of the ten-member committee designated by Acting President Li to draft a peace plan, flew to Xikou yesterday to visit President Chiang, requesting that full power be transferred to Acting President Li and asking to go abroad for recuperation.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] At the Executive Yuan's discussion meeting, the general reaction to the implementation of the financial and economic reform plan and the price increases in various regions were reviewed.

It was generally believed that military reform and political reform should be earnestly promoted at present, and the lives of soldiers and the salaries of government officials and teachers should be improved as soon as possible. Detailed plans should be drafted by the heads of the finance, national defense, and accounting departments and implemented as soon as possible. Regarding the improvement of the salaries of government officials and teachers, the discussion meeting generally agreed that they should be adjusted according to the current month's cost of living index, and in principle, everyone agreed to implement it from this month.

[Central News Agency, Local News] Yu Bingjian, Director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, visited Yan Huiqing yesterday to inquire about the restoration of telecommunications between Shanghai and Beiping, Tianjin, Shenyang, Jinan, Xuzhou, and Zhengzhou. It is understood that since the people on both sides are willing to restore telecommunications as soon as possible, there are no difficulties in principle. However, various technical issues must be implemented after designated personnel go to negotiate the details.

[Our Report] Regarding the issue of postal communications between the Kuomintang and the Communists, after discussions by the peace delegation, an agreement has been reached in principle. It has now been further decided that the postal bureau will send five representatives to Beiping to discuss the details of postal communications with Communist personnel.

According to Zhang, postal communications include letters, packages, and remittances.

At the same time, the implementation of some important policies is subject to the Central Political Committee's prior study and approval. It is very likely that the Central Political Committee will be held in Nanjing.

### Legislative Yuan Holds Closed-Door Meeting to Discuss Motion to Promote Peace; Sun Ke to Report on Policy Direction on the 8th

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The Legislative Yuan held the second meeting of the third session on the morning of the 4th and began its proceedings. First, it handled three telegrams from the Executive Yuan. Next, it discussed measures to protect the basic freedoms of the people and release political prisoners, and decided to request the Executive Yuan to earnestly implement them. In the aforementioned reports and discussions, huge debates were stirred up. Then, Yuan President Tong Guanxian announced that Premier Sun had agreed to come to the Legislative Yuan on the 8th to report on the policy direction. In the afternoon, it discussed the motion to promote national peace. With the consent of the attendees, it was changed to a discussion meeting and held in secret at the request of a certain member.

The morning meeting was delayed until 9:45 AM because the number of attendees was sufficient to meet the quorum. Yuan President Tong Guanxian presided over the meeting, and 169 members attended. After the secretariat read out three telegrams from the Executive Yuan, several committees immediately began to speak, all pointing out that the Executive Yuan's notification to the Legislative Yuan members to attend the meeting in Guangzhou was illegal. Some people advocated that the report should be immediately changed to a discussion item and discussed. Some people advocated that it should be submitted for review and then brought to the meeting for discussion. Some committee members believed that since it was illegal, it should be returned to the Executive Yuan and not accepted. After a long argument, a compromise was reached to propose separate handling methods, that is, the item on the Executive Yuan's telegram about the meeting venue and dormitory in Guangzhou, which was of an administrative nature, should be deleted. The item on the Executive Yuan's letter notifying all agencies to move to Guangzhou should be submitted for review. The item on the Executive Yuan's telegram requesting notification of all committee members to attend the meeting in Guangzhou should be rejected because it was illegal. The chairman submitted it to a vote and it was passed. The four-point method for the progress of the work of the various committees drafted by the Procedural Committee was also passed by the attendees.

Request the Executive Yuan to Earnestly Implement Measures to Release Political Prisoners, etc.

After the break, the discussion began, and the chairman announced a change to the agenda, first discussing the second motion, namely, the "Motion proposed by Xiao Juetian et al. to confirm in advance that the government's four documents on protecting the basic freedoms of the people and releasing political prisoners, etc., are necessary measures and should be earnestly implemented by the Executive Yuan to appease the people and emphasize the rule of law." After the original proposer made a brief explanation, the attendees agreed to the motion in principle, but there was a dispute over the handling method. Some committee members believed that since Acting President Li had telegraphed the Executive Yuan to follow up, and the Executive Yuan had not implemented it effectively, the Legislative Yuan should raise questions. Therefore, they advocated changing it to a questioning motion. Some committee members believed that this motion was suitable for the people's hearts and should be passed by the Yuan. At the same time, someone else advocated submitting it for review. The chairman submitted three methods for voting: (1) change to a questioning motion, (2) submit for review, (3) vote on the original motion. At the time of voting on these three methods, none of the 166 committee members present could obtain a majority of support. So a fierce debate was reopened, and an opinion to revise the title of the original motion was proposed. A certain committee member shouted that this motion was to adapt to the people's hearts, and this motion must not be submitted for review to avoid arousing suspicion, so it must be passed. However, the Legislative Yuan should maintain a detached position, so the title must be corrected. As soon as this proposal came out, it immediately received a majority of applause. After a vote, it was passed by a majority and revised to "Request the Executive Yuan to earnestly implement various measures to protect the basic freedoms of the people and release political prisoners, etc., to emphasize the rule of law." The meeting adjourned at 12:15 PM.

The meeting continued in the afternoon. It was not until 4:05 PM that 161 people were present. It was still chaired by Tong Guanxian, and the discussion proceeded on the motion proposed by Zhang Huiwen and others to hold a meeting of the entire body to discuss how to promote national peace. Zhang Huiwen explained on the spot that in this critical period, encountering this major issue, we cannot but express or make efforts in terms of responsibility and conscience. This kind of effort and expression must be carefully considered. We propose to hold a discussion meeting, one is to exchange opinions and reach a common point of view, and the other is to wait for colleagues from various places who are about to come to Beijing to participate. A certain committee member spoke and advocated that the discussion meeting should be held in secret, and the Executive Yuan should send personnel to attend and report, and invite the Shanghai People's Delegation to come to the meeting to report. In addition, close contact should be maintained with the government officials in charge of the peace plan, and opinions should be exchanged with each other. The chairman sought the consent of the attendees and immediately changed the meeting to a discussion meeting and held it in secret at the request of the committee member. Only ten minutes after the meeting started, the reporters were asked to leave the venue and were kept out of the gate of peace.

Procedural Committee Decides on Agenda for Third Meeting

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The Legislative Yuan's Procedural Committee held a meeting on the evening of the 4th to discuss the agenda for the third meeting of the third session. It was decided that the postal rate increase case should be included in the report items. The increased rate method that has been implemented should complete the legislative procedure retroactively and will be submitted to the Transportation and Finance Committees for review. Among the discussion items, there are two cases: One is the case proposed by Li Feng and more than one hundred people, requesting the heads of the various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan to return to Beijing to work. The case of the Executive Yuan's letter notifying the government agencies to move to Guangzhou, which was decided to be changed to a discussion item at the Yuan's meeting on the 4th, will be discussed jointly. The other is the proposal by Huang Tong and others to request the Executive Yuan to stop conscription of soldiers and grain, which will be submitted to the National Defense and Food Committees for review.

### Chen Yi's Whereabouts a Mystery; Hong Kong Reports That He Has Been Detained, But This Cannot Be Confirmed; Zhang Yanzhe Still Reading Books Behind Closed Doors in Hangzhou

[Our Report] After the dismissal of Chen Yi, the former Chairman of Zhejiang Province, it is still impossible for all parties to explain where he has gone. According to reports, Chen did come to Shanghai for a period of time after his dismissal, and then traveled with Qian Zongqi. As for the rumor that Chen has gone to Taiwan, it is still impossible to confirm this here.

[Our Quzhou Dispatch, 4th] According to reporters who inquired with relevant parties, the rumor that Chen Yi was invited to Quzhou for recuperation could not be confirmed. Zhou Yi'e and Qian Zongqi have also not come to Quzhou.

[Our Hong Kong Dispatch, 4th] According to today's Overseas Chinese Daily in Hong Kong, Chen Yi has been detained for "pioneering local peace." The newspaper also reported that when Chen was in charge of Zhejiang, he advocated making Hangzhou an undefended city.

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 4th] Zhang Yanzhe, former Secretary-General of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, is still living in Hangzhou. This morning, he called our office to subscribe to the newspaper. This afternoon, the reporter visited him and had a personal conversation, proving that the rumor that he accompanied Chen Yi to recuperate in a certain place in eastern Zhejiang is not true. When the reporter met Zhang, he discussed Chinese and Western culture and academic cultivation, etc., on the condition that he would not talk about current politics. Before leaving, he said that he was planning to take this opportunity to cultivate himself and read the newspaper, and he would not leave Hangzhou in the near future.

### Zhang Shizhao Talks About the Situation in Beiping

No Special Changes Yet

[Our Report] The peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communists will apparently begin within a month. However, the opinions of people from both the Kuomintang and the Communist sides on the issue of peace and war have not yet reached a conclusion. Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Zhang Shizhao (pictured), one of the three elders of the Shanghai peace delegation. According to Zhang, the opinions of the Communist side on the issue of peace and war have not yet been unified. Generally speaking, the literati advocate peace, while the military men advocate war. Although Zhou Enlai is known as a general, he is still a literati, and he is also a peace advocate. Secondly, he entrusted the reporter to inquire about the measures taken by the CCP in Beiping, because what some people are most concerned about is whether the CCP today is implementing Marxism or realizing New Democracy. Zhang said, we still cannot see any special changes in Beiping. Although prices are higher than in Nanjing and Shanghai, they are based on millet as the standard, so the fluctuations are not large, and they are working hard on the two points of material exchange and communication to achieve the effect of suppressing prices. The reporter then asked whether the CCP's measures in Beiping could be implemented in Shanghai. Zhang said, "Yes." Because the measures in Beiping are moderate, and so far the household registration has not been investigated. As for the CCP's control of newspapers, the act of stopping all newspapers that have changed their attitude, Zhang and others asked the CCP authorities, who replied that they "can admit mistakes." Regarding the arrest of Xu Huidong, speaker of the Beiping City Council, Zhang confirmed that it was true, but it may not be a big problem, because Xu originally planned to go south, but Fu Zuoyi persuaded him to stay. Therefore, after Xu was arrested, Fu interceded with the Communist side on his behalf. Regarding Fu's own freedom, Zhang said, "We have not seen any signs of unfreedom." Fu has attended their banquets many times, and Zhang's actions in Beiping are also free. However, for their safety, the CCP authorities often send military police to "protect" them. Zhang did not reveal the content of the meetings and talks with Mao Zedong and others, only saying that their mission has ended, but he believes that it is possible that government representatives Shao Lizi and Zhang Qun will participate. Also, Zhang will go to Beijing in the short term to visit Cheng Qian for a meeting.

### U.S. Refuses Silver Loan, Believes That Silver Dollars Minted by China Are in Danger of Flowing Abroad

[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Reliable sources claim that U.S. officials have notified the Chinese government that the recently applied-for silver loan of 200 million U.S. dollars cannot be approved at this time. The main reason for the rejection is that the government's economy is unstable and cannot obtain lasting benefits from the loan, and it is pointed out that the silver dollars it mints are in danger of flowing abroad or into the Communist-controlled areas. It is heard that the new regulations in the Communist-controlled areas of North China prohibit the free circulation of silver dollars. The silver dollars circulating in the government area may be gradually absorbed into the Communist-controlled areas by causing people to stir up exchange rates. The government originally wanted to use the silver loan from the United States to support the new economic plan and raise silver dollars to allow them to circulate freely. However, due to insufficient minting equipment, it was unable to absorb the borrowed silver ingots in large quantities, which is also related to the U.S. decision. Finance Minister Xu Kan admitted that the government had contacted the United States about a silver loan, but no agreement was reached. The Central Bank of Shanghai said that the government is still seeking to borrow silver from the United States.

### Ambassador Gu Visits Deputy Secretary Webb to Discuss the Use of Remaining U.S. Aid Funds; New U.S. Secretary of Defense Concerned About China's Political and Military Situation

[U.S. Information Service, Washington Dispatch, 3rd] Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, visited U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Webb on the 3rd and had a half-hour meeting to discuss the use of the remaining funds under the U.S. aid to China fund.

It is reported that the U.S. economic aid to China of 275 million U.S. dollars and military aid to China of 125 million U.S. dollars have been almost completely used up.

Ambassador Gu said: His visit to Webb "is related to the use of the military aid fund, intending to clarify how to use the deadline of April 3 to make the most of this fund." He pointed out: There are many difficulties in purchasing some materials from manufacturers, so there may be many funds unused in the accounts of April 3. Ambassador Gu said: As a result of his visit, the issue of whether these funds will be reallocated after the deadline is being studied.

Ambassador Gu also discussed China's request for a fund of 500,000 U.S. dollars from the Economic Cooperation Administration to help Chinese students studying in the United States.

There are currently 3,600 Chinese students in the United States, some of whom are in urgent need of financial assistance. Ambassador Gu said: Although he did not receive a specific response from Webb, some people are very concerned about the welfare of these Chinese students studying in the United States. He said: The Chinese government is subsidizing Chinese students who have completed their studies to buy boats to return to China, but some students have not graduated and still need financial assistance.

At the same time, an embassy spokesperson said: China hopes to fully and effectively use the funds of U.S. aid, "its sincerity is the same as that of the United States." This statement is in response to newspaper criticisms of the use of the funds.

[United Press, Washington Dispatch, 3rd] The State Department assured Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun on the 3rd that Secretary of State Acheson did not accuse the Chinese government of misusing U.S. aid.

[Central News Agency, Washington Dispatch, 3rd] According to well-informed sources, Johnson, nominated by Truman today as the new Secretary of Defense, is paying close attention to the current crisis in China. He has recently discussed the CCP issue with the President in several White House meetings and is deeply concerned about our country's political and military situation.

Hurley Delivers Speech Defending the Chinese Government

[Central News Agency, Washington Dispatch, 3rd] Former U.S. Ambassador to China Hurley recently delivered a speech at the Foreign Service School of Georgetown University, defending the Chinese government. He said: The diplomatic mistakes made by the United States in the Yalta Conference in making concessions to the Soviet Union are the reason why the Communist Party has achieved success in China. Hurley admitted that China has a corrupt system, but the existence of this system has a long history, and China is unable to punish cunning people. The U.S. concessions to the Soviet Union at the Yalta Conference formed a plan, and the Communist Party's conquest of China was the consequence. He did not know who should be responsible for the concessions at the Yalta Conference, but President Roosevelt was a patient at Yalta.

### Wu Yu-hou's Membership

The National Policy Research Association Has Revoked It

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The National Policy Research Association of university professors, which initiated the organization of the "Nanjing People's Peace Delegation" to Beiping, issued another statement on the 4th, reiterating that the delegation had been disbanded. The "China People's Peace Promotion Association" organized by the association was also deemed unnecessary to continue its work as the government was about to start peace talks with the Chinese Communists, and it was decided to end it. The statement also stated: "The Standing Committee of the National Policy Research Association of Chinese University Professors has revoked the membership of Standing Committee member Wu Yu-hou due to his recent erratic behavior and absurd remarks, and his personal activities outside the association will have nothing to do with the association from now on."

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 4th] Wu Yu-hou and Wu Zhe-sheng flew to Shanghai on a Central Airlines plane at 9:15 this morning, from where they will transfer to Nanjing. According to Wu Yu-hou's statement to reporters: Liao Chengzhi has gone to Beiping, and he is preparing to take the written peace proposal put forward by the Chinese Communists to Nanjing to report to President Sun and Acting President Li.

### Taiwan Public Opinion Representatives

Believe the Independence Movement Propaganda

Is a Smokescreen Deliberately Released by Ambitious Individuals

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 4th] Recently, various reports have mentioned the activities of the Taiwan Independence League and its propaganda that Taiwan is merely occupied by China. This reporter has recently interviewed public opinion representatives and intellectuals in Taiwan, and they all pointed out frankly that this is a smokescreen deliberately laid out by ambitious individuals in an attempt to achieve their conspiracy. They fundamentally deny the existence of the so-called Taiwan Independence League; and claim that this is by no means done by genuine Taiwanese compatriots.

Editorial

### Unity Innovation Peace

The Shanghai Peace Delegation has completed its mission and returned with joy, and the atmosphere of peace throughout the country has suddenly become thicker. Dr. Yan Huiqing brought back a letter from Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party to Acting President Li, stating that the Chinese Communist Party would announce the list of peace talk representatives after March 15, determine the location of the peace talks, and begin negotiations immediately. This letter can explain that the Shanghai Peace Delegation's claim that "the Chinese Communist Party is willing to conduct peace talks with the government on an equal basis" is not an empty statement. At the same time, in order to show the government's sincerity in seeking peace, Acting President Li specially convened a meeting of central and local leaders on the "day to designate ten people to be responsible for drafting a peace plan, which is to be completed within ten days. Although its content is not yet known, judging from the dynamics in all aspects, the prospect of peace seems to have been encouraged, and there is hope that the haze in the sky may be cleared as a result.

However, the road to peace is really a long and arduous one. The Shanghai Peace Delegation's written statement said: "Although there are many difficulties in the future of peace talks, there is great hope." Conversely, it can also be said that "although the hope is great, there are still many difficulties." There is a history of more than ten years of separation and reunion between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and their suspicion has not come about overnight. Now, if they want to dispel suspicion and reconcile, it cannot be achieved overnight. However, if both sides can meet each other with sincerity, take the country and the people as the most important thing, and tolerate each other at any time and in everything, it will not be difficult to dissolve the accumulated suspicion in the past. Therefore, we cannot but pay special attention to the preparatory work done by both sides before the start of the peace talks. We have no way of knowing the real situation on the Chinese Communist side, so let's set it aside for the time being, but for the various efforts made by the government recently to promote peace, we are willing to contribute some opinions on the occasion of the Legislative Yuan's review of the peace plan.

First, seeking peace must be sincere, and it goes without saying that the government must show the facts of wholeheartedly seeking peace; but relying on one side's sincerity and willingness to compromise to seek peace alone, if the other party is not sincere, peace talks will not be easy to succeed. Peace talks are like a couple making up after a quarrel. If the husband doesn't give in three points, the wife has to give in three points. If each other recalls the old love in the past, and there is something good in the past, then the broken mirror can still be reunited, let alone anything else? However, the key lies in whether both parties can indeed be tolerant. Secondly, peace talks are like buying and selling in the market. It will probably take some "bargaining" before a "deal" is made. No matter how high the seller sets the "empty head", no matter how the buyer wants to "cut the price in half", as long as both parties are sincere in making this transaction, there is a possibility that this deal will be made. Using this as an example, no matter which side, don't regard this peace negotiation as surrender and acceptance of surrender, then it can be hoped to succeed. Otherwise, if the representatives of Acting President Li are forced to accept peace terms in the style of a textbook, it will not be like peace talks, but unconditional surrender. As for how the government can obtain this equal status, the most important thing is the internal unity of the government. Unity is strength, and strength can be balanced. Therefore, we have always used this yardstick to weigh the government's recent efforts to seek peace. Any measures that weaken the government's position in the peace talks are the most likely to show that the government has sincerity in peace, but they are not what wise people should do, and they are only harmful and not beneficial to the future of peace. Even if one borrows the pen of a foreign news agency reporter to create rumors and sow discord, as if this is the only way to feel happy, it is actually harmful and not beneficial to peace talks and the future of China.

Second, after China has gone through eight years of war against Japan, and then more than three years of internal strife, the people of the whole country have become refugees after the disaster. If the war cannot be stopped immediately, the suffering people will feel that they cannot survive. Both sides have expressed their willingness to conduct peace talks to end the war as soon as possible, and have repeatedly stated that it is for the sake of pitying the suffering of the people. However, today, the war and peace have not been decided, and it will take a considerable amount of time to delay. How can the government sit idly by and allow the people to suffer? Therefore, during the peace talks, for the sake of being concerned about the suffering of the people, in addition to sincerely seeking peace and realizing peace as soon as possible, the government should also "do its best", innovate politics, and reduce the suffering of the people. All administrative affairs that the people are grieved and indignant about should be stopped immediately. The points expressed by President Sun to reporters in Nanjing yesterday, such as changing conscription to recruitment, and then reducing the number of soldiers, and at the same time canceling the requisition of grain and borrowing, etc., we only hope that they will be cashed as soon as possible, and no longer be regarded as empty checks.

In short, unity, innovation, and peace are already the national policies of the current time, and the government should make every effort to achieve them, but "everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world", and everyone in the country has the responsibility for promoting the realization of peace. Everyone should know that peace cannot fall from the sky, but must be achieved through the efforts of the people. With the Kuomintang-Communist peace talks approaching, the people of the whole country should stand up, provide the people's opinions, and exert the people's strength, so that both sides cannot but obey public opinion and abandon war and seek peace.

### The Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu is Actively Deploying Troops Are Frequently Deployed Along the River Bank

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 4th] The Communist Army in northern Jiangsu is actively deploying, posing a threat to the south of the Yangtze River. The Nationalist army's bridgehead positions in Shijiaqiao, facing Zhenjiang, are now under strict guard. The situation of the Communist army on the front has changed again today. According to military intelligence: (1) In addition to a part of the 10th Column, about 1,000 people, there are also about 600 people from the Huaihe Brigade and about 500 people from the Jiangdu Independent Regiment on the east bank of the canal facing the Shijiaqiao bridgehead. (2) The Huaihai Independent Brigade of the Communist Army, which was originally stationed on the east bank of the canal, has now been transferred to Dongtai for reorganization. (3) The Communist Army on the west bank of the canal is still the New 6th Regiment and the Xinghua Independent Regiment.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 4th] The Communist Army in northern Jiangsu is frequently deployed. According to reports: the main force of the 11th Column of Chen Yi's troops is concentrated on the Kou (An) Tai (Xian) line and is currently moving towards Taixing; the 12th Column has arrived at the Shaobo Xiannvmiao line, and a part of the 10th Column, about 1,000 people, has moved south to face the Nationalist army positions in Shijiaqiao (in the area east of the canal). According to the air force's reconnaissance report yesterday: between Tongyu Zhan Shangdonghe and Haian, and between Jiangyan and Haian on the Haitai line, there were about 25,000 Communist army formations concentrating on Haian. Another part of the Communist army, about 15,000 people, moved from Haian along the highway towards Rugao. The above Communist army totals 60,000 people, which is obviously related to the information that the air force recently discovered that more than 9,000 Communist army troops were moving south between Yancheng and Funing. The military has not yet received accurate information on the number of this Communist army, but relevant parties strongly claim that this Communist army must be the 10th, 11th, and 12th columns that moved south from the Lianghuai area, and may have been transferred from southern Shandong. Looking at the Yangtze River line in northern Jiangsu, in addition to the 2nd, 3rd, 9th, Bohai, and Rapid Columns originally stationed between Yangzhou and Tianchang, the general public believes that the Communist Army will use the 10th, 11th, and 12th Columns that moved south from Lianghuai on the line from Yangzhou to Taixing, and the part moving south from the Tongyu line may be assembled on the east and west banks of the Yangtze River below Jingjiang and Nantong, to pose as if they are crossing the river.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 4th] It is reported that a certain high-level command post of the Communist Army stationed in Yangzhou is currently outside the South Gate, and the headquarters of the 10th Column is outside the North Gate Fengqiao Bridge. In addition, the Communist Army has set up a mountain gun outside Fuyun Gate.

[Central News Agency, Zhenjiang, 4th] The Communist Army in Jiangbei is moving south. Apart from a small contact on the Sanwen River on the evening of the 2nd, it is expected that there may be a small battle for Guazhou in the next few days. In total, the Communist Army in the Yangzhou Tai Gaobao area has the numbers of the 2nd, 10th, 11th, 12th, and 4th Columns. Its Southeast Detachment and the Yangzhou Yi local team are harassing near Guazhou, and their strength is not great. Its local teams in Gaobao and Liangtai are active east of Yangzhou and south of Taixing, seemingly wanting to disturb Kouan, Longwo and other bridgeheads. Its motive for coming south is obviously more political than military, followed by moving troops to eat, and also to enrich its newly occupied areas.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 4th] A telegram from Zhenjiang said: Fighting continued last night near the two bridgeheads of the Nationalist army opposite Zhenjiang. More than 1,000 Communist army troops engaged in fierce fighting with the Nationalist army for three hours west of Shijiaqiao. There was also fighting near the San Duhe River. Today, it is reported that the Communist army is advancing towards Yizheng, so ferries between Zhenjiang and the north bank have been suspended.

### Ma Hongda Returned to Ningxia from Lanzhou Talks About Politics Being More Important Than Military Affairs in the Northwest

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 4th] Ma Hongda, Chairman of Ningxia, came to Lanzhou a month ago to discuss the overall situation in the Northwest and treat his illness.

It is also learned that he will fly directly from Ningxia to Shanghai for medical treatment. Before his departure, Mr. Ma issued a statement saying: The Northwest generally believes that military affairs are very important, but in fact they are related to political issues, so politics is more important than military affairs. The people of the Northwest urgently need political reform, and those in power should follow the opinions of the people to adapt to the trend of the times. Regarding the financial relief and reform issues in the Northwest, a contingency plan has been drafted, and Zhang Changgong is consulting in Nanjing. The implementation scope includes the three provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai. As for the issuance of provincial currency, because there are more disadvantages than advantages, it is absolutely impossible. In the past, Ningxia issued provincial currency, resulting in a loss of 4 million hard currency, which can serve as a warning.

### Norway Decides to Join the Atlantic Alliance; Attends Washington Talks for the First Time; Denmark Takes Same Step as Norway

[Report from our own correspondent] Washington, broadcast on the 4th: The Norwegian Ambassador to the United States, Morgenstierne, participated in the Atlantic Pact negotiations this afternoon and was warmly welcomed by the representatives of various countries.

[Report from our own correspondent] Washington, broadcast on the 4th: Negotiations on the North Atlantic Pact were held at the State Department at 11 o'clock this morning. The main topic of discussion was which countries should be invited to join the pact. The Norwegian Ambassador visited Acheson at 11:30 this morning and was scheduled to attend the negotiations immediately after the meeting. However, French Ambassador Bonnet stated that a conclusion might not be reached at this morning's meeting.

[Report from the United Press, Oslo, on the 4th] The Norwegian Parliament passed a resolution on the 4th by an overwhelming majority to join the negotiations on the Atlantic Pact. This move by the Norwegian Parliament came shortly after the Norwegian government bluntly rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to conclude a non-aggression pact.

[Report from the United Press, Washington, on the 4th] Diplomatic sources stated on the 4th that Denmark will soon follow Norway in joining the negotiations on the Atlantic Pact. Sources also stated that Italy, Iceland, and Portugal are also considering the conditions for joining the pact. Western powers believe that the Kremlin will resist the pact in words rather than actions, but they also feel some concern that the Red Army may advance into Finland as a "safeguarding measure". Norway's participation in the Atlantic Pact extends the scope of the pact to the Soviet Union's front door. Diplomatic officials believe that Norway's joining the pact negotiations will advance the eight-month-long negotiations to a successful stage, possibly allowing the pact to be signed within ten days. Officials are eager to have the pact signed, ratified, and implemented as soon as possible.

[Report from Reuters, Ottawa, on the 3rd] Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson told reporters here today that Canada has received the full text of the draft North Atlantic Treaty and is generally satisfied with it.

It is generally believed that Canada has informed the other countries of the treaty, stating that it does not oppose Italy's participation. Pearson added that if the ambassadors participating in the talks in Washington can agree on the timing of the publication of the treaty, then the treaty may be published by next week. It is also known that the Canadian government has decided that even if the ambassadors do not agree, the Canadian government will soon publish the contents of the treaty in a selected manner so that the people can be informed. Regarding the location of the signing of the treaty, the representatives of the countries have not yet decided. Pearson believes that the most likely location is Bermuda.

[Report from Agence France-Presse, Washington, on the 3rd] Well-informed sources say that the North Atlantic Treaty will be signed in Washington, not on the island of Bermuda in the Caribbean Sea.

[Report from Reuters, Oslo, on the 4th] The Norwegian Foreign Ministry delivered a reply yesterday to the Soviet Ambassador to Norway, rejecting the Soviet Union's proposal to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Norway, stating that Norway belongs to Western Europe. The reply, which was published this morning, informed the Soviet Union in a polite, friendly but firm tone that Norway cannot conclude any military agreement with the Soviet Union due to its preparation to join the North Atlantic Pact. Since the terms of the North Atlantic Pact are fully in line with the spirit and provisions of the United Nations Charter, Norway has decided to join the Pact.

In addition, Norway believes that it will never be attacked by the Soviet Union, so there is no need to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. Norway will continue to maintain friendship with the Soviet Union, but any future friendship treaties signed with the Soviet Union should be based on the principle of reciprocity. When mentioning the North Atlantic Pact, the reply stated that the Norwegian government is willing to guarantee to the Soviet Union that it will never grant any bases within Norwegian territory to any signatory country of the North Atlantic Pact, and it is not expected that a situation that would overturn this policy will occur. The reply went on to promise Norway's continued efforts to promote trade relations with the Soviet Union and suggested ways to promote cultural and educational understanding between the two countries. The note continued, Norway, although deciding to link its destiny with the West, the nature of the North Atlantic Pact, originally with the hope of promoting common understanding between the Scandinavian countries and the Soviet Union as the greatest expectation. Norway decided to reject the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union after careful consideration. Norwegian newspapers this morning all published the Norwegian government's decision under prominent headlines. "Social Daily" called it an epoch-making decision that there is no reason to turn back. After receiving the note, the Soviet Ambassador declined to comment, but the Norwegian Communist Party immediately issued a statement condemning the government's action. Members of the Norwegian Parliament all support the government's decision. A spokesman for Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange told reporters that Lange did not believe that Norwegian relations would deteriorate as a result. Lange had given the decision much thought before taking it and had made special trips to Washington and London. The spokesman added that Sweden and Denmark were also satisfied with Norway's decision.

### Soviet Union Proposes International Control of Atomic Bombs; The United Nations Should Consider It; Statement Issued by the Federation of American Scientists

[Report from the United Press, Washington, on the 3rd] The Federation of American Scientists issued a statement today expressing satisfaction with the resumption of discussions by the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission after a long period of silence. However, it stated that the United Nations should carefully consider the Soviet Union's proposal to establish an international control agency while destroying atomic weapons. When the Security Council recently debated the issue of atomic energy, the Soviet Union accused the United States of attempting to hoard atomic bombs and threaten the world, and demanded that major powers notify the United Nations of the number of atomic bombs they each have before the end of March. The Soviet Union insisted that atomic weapons should be considered illegal and destroyed before the establishment of an international control program. Later, it proposed at the United Nations General Assembly that both could be carried out simultaneously, which was an important step towards agreement, and the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission should consider it in detail.

### Forrestal's Resignation Approved; Johnson Succeeds as Secretary of Defense; Army Secretary Royal Still Intends to Retire

[Report from the United Press, Washington, on the 3rd] President Truman announced today that Secretary of Defense Forrestal had submitted his resignation due to private matters and will step down on the 31st of this month. His vacancy will be filled by former Under Secretary of the Army Johnson. Secretary of the Army Royal, Secretary of the Navy Sullivan, and Secretary of the Air Force Symington will remain in office.

Truman also produced correspondence between himself and Forrestal, saying that while he had approved the resignation, it was not his wish and that he hoped that Forrestal could still assist the government in strengthening national defense. Forrestal is 57 years old. He served as Secretary of the Navy from May 1944 to July 1947, and was the only remaining important figure from President Roosevelt's administration. There had been talk of him leaving the cabinet last year.

The new Secretary Johnson is a lawyer from West Virginia, aged 58. He served as Under Secretary of the Army from 1937 to 1940 during President Roosevelt's successive re-elections. Last year, he served as the chairman of the Democratic Party's Finance Committee and was responsible for raising campaign funds during the party's bleak hopes of winning the presidency, and he put in a lot of effort.

[Report from the United Press, Washington, on the 3rd] Secretary of the Army Royal sent a congratulatory letter today after the President announced the appointment of Johnson as Secretary of Defense, and reiterated his intention to retire at a press conference. It is said that "as soon as I have a clear conscience, I hope to be relieved of my duties and return to my hometown."

### Johnson Expresses His Views: The United States Must Maintain a Strong Military Force

Otherwise, There Will Be No Peace in the World

[Report from our own correspondent] Washington, broadcast on the 4th: Newly appointed US Secretary of Defense Johnson recently stated that the United States must maintain a strong military force, because if the United States is not strong and powerful, there will be no peace in the world. Johnson met with former Secretary Forrestal at the White House today, and Johnson revealed that Forrestal had informed him of this news a few days ago. Johnson will take office on March 31, and it is expected that the Senate will approve his appointment. Forrestal said that he has not yet decided on new plans after leaving office, but he will submit recommendations to Congress requesting amendments to the Unified Command Act of the Army, Navy, and Air Force passed in 1947, because the current level of unification of the three services is still not satisfactory.

[Report from Agence France-Presse, Washington, on the 3rd] Observers here believe that Truman's appointment of Air Force expert Johnson as Secretary of Defense symbolizes that the US Air Force will be greatly reorganized. Johnson is a director of the Vought Aircraft Factory and personally planned the manufacture of the B-17 Flying Fortress during the Roosevelt administration. He was also responsible for shipping military supplies to Britain at the beginning of World War I, despite opposition from his colleagues in the War Department. Johnson is also the initiator of the "Strategic Air Command," so his rise to power will prompt the resignation of Army Secretary Royal, because Royal adheres to the principle of the Army First.

### New Israeli Cabinet Formed; Application to Join the United Nations Can Be Approved

[Report from the United Press, Lake Success, on the 4th] The United Nations Security Council is expected to approve the Israeli application to join the United Nations today. The four major powers, the United States, China, France, and the Soviet Union, will all vote in favor, and Britain has indicated that it does not intend to use its veto.

### There are Three Main Reasons for Forrestal's Departure

[Report from Agence France-Presse, Washington, on the 3rd] Diplomatic sources said today that there are three main reasons for the resignation of US Secretary of Defense Forrestal: First, on the issue of the Arab-Jewish dispute, Forrestal has always advocated that the United States support Arab countries in order to protect US oil rights in the Middle East, but Democratic leaders opposed this view. Henderson, the Director of the Middle East Division of the State Department, was forced to resign because he agreed with Forrestal's views, and Forrestal also felt uneasy in his position. Second, Forrestal opposed Norway's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty, believing that this move violated the United States' military interests, while the State Department agreed to Norway's participation. Third, Forrestal has always advocated an equal balance of power between the Army, Navy, and Air Force, which was also opposed by the faction that advocated expanding the Air Force. According to a report from the United Press, Forrestal was quite involved in internal government disputes and reportedly had disagreements with the President on the Holy Land and other diplomatic issues. Although his family was wealthy, he did not provide much financial or other support during Truman's campaign.

However, the timing of their attendance was not resolved after three hours of fierce debate among the four powers. It was then decided to adjourn the meeting until next Monday for further discussion. Today, the Soviet representative insisted that the Southern representative must attend and express his views first, and then the four powers will discuss it again, which is obviously intended to make the Southern country make new concessions in its demands on Austria.

### Israeli-Jordanian Peace Talks at a Standstill

Israeli-Lebanese Negotiations Have Reached an Agreement

[Report from the United Press, Rhodes, on the 3rd] Jordan's insistence on placing the issue of Arab refugees at the top of the agenda has stalled the Israeli-Jordanian armistice talks. The signing of the Israeli-Lebanese agreement may be delayed until the 4th or 5th due to technical difficulties in preparing the translation, but officials said that the agreement is nearing completion.

### South Africa Plans to Raise The Official World Gold Price

US Treasury Secretary Snyder Expresses Opposition

[Report from the United Press, Washington, on the 3rd] Treasury Secretary Snyder declared today that the United States supports the dispute between the International Monetary Fund and the South African Federation over the gold price issue. The United States insists that the official world gold price should remain at the original price of thirty-five dollars per ounce. It is difficult to agree with the South African Prime Minister's claim that this official price cannot last. South Africa, the world's largest gold producer, intends to raise the gold price by six dollars and fifty cents to forty-one dollars and fifty cents per ounce.

### Soviet Union Repatriates僑 Withdraws National Flag and Withdraws from the American-Occupied Zone of Germany. The Soviet Union Retaliates by Expelling the American War Dead Custodial Team

[United Press International, Frankfurt, 4th] The Soviet Union yielded to American pressure today, ordering its repatriation mission to withdraw from here. The mission, consisting of eight members, lowered its national flag this morning, angrily left its office, and departed in three cars and two trucks for the Soviet zone of Germany.

The vehicles were laden with luggage, along with worn tires and gasoline drums. The departing personnel appeared stern, and the drivers insulted passing American women by spitting at them. The interior of the office was a mess, as the delegation had spent hours burning documents beforehand, but all the luggage was inspected by American military police.

[Reuters, Berlin, 4th] The Soviet repatriation mission entered the Soviet zone this morning and immediately boarded a plane for Moscow to submit a report to its government. At approximately the same time, the American War Dead Custodial Committee, which had been ordered to leave by Soviet Military Commander Sokolovsky, arrived in Berlin from the Soviet zone. The American military commander in Berlin, Holley, told reporters that General Clay would protest the matter to the Soviets, as the remains of many American soldiers killed in action during the war had yet to be found in the Soviet zone, and therefore their mission was not yet complete.

### On the Soviet Union Repatriation Mission Incident, the United States Rejects Soviet Protest

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] The U.S. government recently sent a note to the Soviet Foreign Ministry in Moscow, in response to the Soviet government's note regarding the incident of February 20th. The U.S. response flatly rejected the Soviet Union's protest, asserting that it completely distorted the facts. The Soviet protest note claimed that the United States' actions violated the repatriation agreement signed in Crimea in February 1945 and further accused American officials in Germany of obstructing the repatriation mission's work. The U.S. response rejected all these charges and declared that the U.S. government fully approved of the stance taken by the U.S. military commander, General Clay, and demanded that the Soviet repatriation mission immediately withdraw from the American-occupied zone. The note further pointed out that the Soviet repatriation mission was repatriating fewer than nine people per month, and that future repatriation work could be handled by the Soviet military mission. Regarding the Soviet protest's claim that anti-Soviet groups in Germany were hindering the Soviet repatriation mission's work, the U.S. response dismissed it as unacceptable.

### The Soviet Union Will Exert Political Pressure on India

[Report from this Newspaper] London, 4th (broadcast): British government Far East experts anticipate that the Soviet Union will exert political pressure on India. They state that after Norway refused to sign a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's expansion to the West has encountered setbacks and will instead shift to the East. They believe that the riots in Calcutta last week and the Bengali government's ban on Communist activities have not actually diminished the strength of the Communist Party, as the Indian government's declaration of an anti-Communist policy has in fact caused the Communist Party to switch from open activities to underground work, and the Communist Party has already gained leadership of various important labor unions. Furthermore, the Soviet Union's expansion of power in Xinjiang and Moscow Radio's attacks on Nehru can all be seen as signs of the Soviet Union's designs on India.

### Britain to Donate 103 Aircraft to the Indian Air Force

[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 4th (broadcast): Bombay dispatch: The British government has decided to transfer 100 British fighter planes and three jet aircraft to the Indian Air Force.

### British House of Commons Passes Massive Military Expenditure by Overwhelming Majority. Defense Minister Vigorously Defends Policy

[United Press International, London, 3rd] The House of Commons tonight passed Britain's largest peacetime military budget, totaling £759,860,000, by a vote of 227 to 3.

[Reuters, London, 3rd] During today's debate in the House of Commons on the government's defense policy, Defense Minister Alexander first addressed the House, strongly asserting that since the Soviet Union retained its "veto power over peace and security," Britain must assume its full share of responsibility in the defense of the free nations of the world.

Alexander stated that Britain has always believed that Britain must act collectively. In today's world, it is impossible to believe that a country can isolate itself. The Western European Union Defense Committee, chaired by Field Marshal Montgomery, is formulating plans to deal with any emergency, and the defense ministers of Western European countries have made considerable progress. Regarding the North Atlantic Treaty, Alexander said that at this stage, it was not convenient to make any statements, but the fact that this agreement was under discussion deserved full attention. Alexander also assured the House of Commons that Britain had sufficient stocks of military equipment, and the government was not satisfied with this, as the equipment needed after the defense plans currently being formulated were fully implemented would be much more advanced than what currently existed. Regarding colonial defense, Alexander said that recent events had shown the need to promote economic development in the colonies, so it was not advisable to develop local defense forces on a large scale at this time, but the need to maintain internal security had also been fully recognized. The colonial governments had been making various efforts to strengthen their local guard forces. Subsequently, an opposition motion to reject the government's statement of defense policy, arguing that its content was inappropriate, was rejected by a vote of 291 to 155.

### Negotiations Between Dutch and Indonesian Leaders Still Pending, The Hague Conference to be Postponed, United States Opposes UN Sending Representatives to Attend

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 3rd] Well-informed sources claim that the round table conference scheduled to be held in The Hague on March 12 may be postponed because preliminary negotiations with the leaders of the Indonesian Republic will require considerable time. It is reported that the Indonesian leaders in Bangka are very divided on the round table conference. One faction, led by Hatta, advocates participation, while another faction, led by the head of the Republic's delegation, Wim, intends to refuse to participate, as the Netherlands' convening of the round table conference is tantamount to rejecting the Security Council's January 28 recommendation.

[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 4th (broadcast): UN official Filipino representative Romulo hosted a luncheon today for the UN representatives of various countries who had attended the New Delhi conference to informally exchange views on the Indonesian issue.

[United Press International, Lake Success, 3rd] The Netherlands' representative to the United Nations, Hogelonghi, sent a letter today to the current chairman of the Security Council, Cuban representative Alvarez, requesting that the United Nations send representatives to participate in the Dutch-Indonesian round table conference to be held in The Hague on March 12. The letter stated that the Netherlands' proposal, though different in approach, was aimed at promoting Indonesian independence, so the Security Council should support its success. The Security Council is expected to discuss the Indonesian issue next Monday. A spokesperson for the United States stated that the United States would oppose UN representatives attending the round table conference unless the leaders of the Indonesian Republic agreed to attend. According to news from Batavia, the leaders of the Indonesian Republic have refused to participate, and the Netherlands has recognized another group to represent the Indonesian Republic at the conference.

### Burmese Government Rejects Five-Nation Mediation Proposal

Burmese Envoy Expresses to Nehru

[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 4th (broadcast): New Delhi dispatch: Well-informed sources claim that India's previous proposal to Burma to mediate the dispute between Burma and the Karen people has apparently been rejected by the Burmese government. Indian officials revealed that Burmese Attorney General U Chan Htoon had told Nehru that the Burmese government was capable of resolving its internal disputes without foreign assistance. The dispute between Burma and the Karen people, and the increase in Communist forces in Burma, have caused deep unease in Eastern countries. Nehru and Evatt expressed concern, so Nehru sent a letter to Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu, suggesting five-nation mediation of the internal conflict.

### Raising Subsistence Funds for Garrison Troops, Collecting Security Donations for Three Months, Targeting Larger Industrial and Commercial Enterprises, Collection Committee Established Yesterday, Over One Hundred Members Elected

[Report from this Newspaper] Since the beginning of this year, the number of garrison troops stationed in the city has suddenly increased, estimated to be around 200,000. The central government's allocation for their subsistence is currently only sufficient for two catties of pork, two catties of soybean oil, and one catty of salt per person per month. It is impossible to purchase other vegetables and fuel, which inevitably leads to borrowing from merchants and residents in the city. In order to protect the peace of mind of merchants and residents and to promote harmonious relations between the military and the people, the municipal government has repeatedly consulted with the central government and relevant military authorities, agreeing that all troops stationed in the city will be provided with one catty of vegetables and one and a half catties of firewood per person per month by local efforts to supplement their food. It was also agreed that the relevant authorities should restrain the troops from disturbing the people. After the above principles were determined, the city's trade associations advanced 150 million yuan last month to purchase 8,000 dan of firewood from Hangzhou. The Taishi firewood industry association supplied 20,000 dan at 80% of the market price. In addition, a large quantity of vegetables was purchased from the Shanghai vegetable industry association and allocated to various troops through the city's military-civilian cooperation committee. Leading figures in the city's industrial and commercial sectors, recognizing that the local authorities had painstakingly negotiated this supplementary supply method, believed that funds should be raised as soon as possible. After a concrete exchange of views, it was decided to collect from the various trade associations in the name of "local security donation" and to organize a local security donation collection committee to be responsible for handling the matter. The committee has been actively preparing for the past week and is now ready. Yesterday afternoon, a founding conference was held at the city's chamber of commerce. More than 100 people attended, including Xu Jishang from the city's chamber of commerce, Liu Hongsheng from the city's industrial association, and the chairmen of various trade associations. Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan also attended the meeting to explain the authorities' unavoidable need to ask the local community for money and expressed hope that after the establishment of the committee, all collection, procurement, auditing, and other work would be handled by personnel selected by the committee itself, with the municipal government only playing an assisting role. The distribution and allocation of funds in the future would be the responsibility of the military-civilian cooperation committee. The proposed method was to print "vegetable tickets" and "firewood tickets" and distribute them to the troops to be collected from designated locations or shops, in order to avoid some unnecessary disturbances. Subsequently, the entire body passed the local security donation collection method and elected 148 members, including 37 standing committee members: Liu Hongsheng, Hu Xiyuan, Xu Xueyu, Wu Yunzhu, Luo Qinghua, Pan Shihao, Jin Runku, Tian Heqing, Zhu Zhuyi, Guo Yongxi, etc. Xu Yongzuo, Li Wenjie, and Wang Naixu were elected as auditing committee members. At the same time, Mayor Wu was also appointed as the chairman, and Du Yuesheng and Xu Jixiang were appointed as vice-chairmen. Wang Xianqing was appointed as the general secretary, and Yan Esheng was appointed as the chief secretary. Speaker Pan was also appointed as a guiding committee member. Finally, the entire body passed the resolution that the local security donation would officially begin tomorrow (the 6th).

### New Police Chief Mao Sen Emphasizes Prohibition of Corruption Among Subordinates. Sincerely Hopes That Friction Between the Military and Civilians Will Not Occur Again

[Report from this Newspaper] General Mao Sen, the new police chief who is scheduled to take office next Monday, met with reporters yesterday and stated: The police bureau is an agency that is close to the people. All issues, such as the handling of labor and student movements, will be handled in accordance with the law and will not go beyond the scope. After taking office, he does not intend to make any changes to the personnel of the police bureau. He will make every effort to rectify discipline, and corruption and incompetence will not be tolerated. Mao stressed: My consistent style of doing things in the past, in addition to paying attention to reality, is to absolutely prohibit subordinates from being corrupt in personnel management and strictly require staff to be diligent in their duties. He will certainly implement this spirit in the future. However, the police bureau has a large structure and complex personnel. The establishment of good discipline, in addition to his own efforts, still requires the assistance of all sectors of society. General Mao sincerely hoped that friction between the garrison and the citizens would not occur again in the future, causing emotional harm. He also said that since the police bureau is a security agency, it should closely cooperate with the garrison command to promote everything.

### New Rent Standards Seek Reasonableness and Thoroughness. Director Shen Will Invite All Parties to Further Solicit Concrete Opinions

[Report from this Newspaper] The new rent standards for the city have been drafted by the Land Administration Bureau and were originally to be submitted to the Municipal Conference for review this week. However, because this matter is related to the housing problems of five million citizens, standards that are too high or too low are likely to cause disputes. Director Shen of the Land Administration Bureau has paid close attention to this and will revise them more carefully, so the draft could not be sent out this week. The bureau met with Jiang Hao, Chen Peide, and other representatives of the Tenants' Union yesterday. It is claimed that the City Council originally resolved to convert one yuan of pre-war rent into four or five fen in gold yuan, using this as a base number and multiplying it by the cost of living index. This resolution is far from reality, and the Tenants' Union is willing to agree to raise it based on the current situation. The Real Estate Association also sent representatives Zhu Xiaofang, Chen Shukun, Zhang Dehua, and others to the Land Administration Bureau to state their opinions yesterday. It is claimed that the Real Estate Association has always prohibited member companies from renting in foreign currency and in kind. If there are such situations, they will be corrected.

### Raising Grain Reserves for Three Months, Loan of 10 Billion, Mayor Wu is Negotiating with National Banks

[Shanghai News Agency News] The price of rice in the city has been trading at an unreasonably high price for more than a week. On the 3rd of this month, the prices in the north and south markets soared to over 20,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, a reporter asked Wang Jiashu, the director of the Economic Administration of the Social Affairs Bureau, about this issue concerning people's livelihood. According to him, since Mayor Wu ordered the restoration of free trade in rice, the price of rice has indeed been soaring. The Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau have attached great importance to this, but monitoring under market control is a temporary solution and cannot make the price of rice tend towards a reasonable state. Therefore, the Municipal Government's People's Food Allocation Office and the Social Affairs Bureau have recently consulted and decided to solve the people's food problem from the root. Mayor Wu has negotiated with the Central Bank for a loan to prepare grain reserves for three months. The loan amount is quite large. According to related sources, the loan amount will be around 10 billion yuan. The Central Bank has accepted it in principle, and after negotiation, it will borrow ships from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to purchase large quantities from domestic and foreign production areas. This may also be a comforting agent amid the white terror.

### Coal Shortage Serious, Still Unresolved, Two Railway Bureaus Consider Reducing Train Schedules

[Report from Our Newspaper] The coal shortage problem for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways remains serious. For the past month, the two railways have been borrowing coal daily from various locations. The Smoke Coal Adjustment Committee and the Four Mines Joint Operation Office have repeatedly lent coal, undoubtedly providing the greatest possible assistance. However, the railway bureaus are limited by their own finances, unable to purchase and store large quantities. Moreover, coal prices have been rising sharply. The average price in February increased as much as twelve times. The railway bureaus' total revenue for January was insufficient to cover the coal expenses for that month. The deficit had to be balanced with loans from the Central Bank. Director Wang Zhaohuai is troubled by this daily, running around and contacting various parties. He is considering reducing the number of train schedules on both lines to save coal. Although this method is akin to "cutting off one's nose to spite one's face," there are indeed no better solutions before thoroughly improving the economy and clearing coal supply channels.

### A Package Found at the North Station, Hiding a Large Amount of Communist Currency

[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, a large quantity of North Sea Bank banknotes used in the Communist areas was discovered at the North Station in this city. It happened around seven o'clock in the morning when the "Triumph" express train on the Beijing-Shanghai line was about to depart. A railway police officer noticed a piece of luggage wrapped in a printed cotton sheet left on the platform, unattended. As the train departed, no one came to claim it. The railway police officer went forward to inspect and saw that the package was full of stacks of new banknotes. Upon closer inspection, they turned out to be 500-yuan notes from the North Sea Bank. These banknotes were very small in size, shaped like the one-jiao coins issued by the Central Bank before the war (see the image). The printing paper was extremely rough. The estimated total amount was around five to six million yuan (based on face value). The railway police authorities are currently considering how to dispose of it.

### Standing Director of the China Textile Corporation Involved in House Purchase Scandal, Secretary Guo Ying Released on Bail, Ni Bi Announces Results of Various Investigations

Commissioner Ni Bi of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Supervisory Committee told reporters about the results of the committee's recent investigations: (1) Central Bank gold and silver southward transportation case: It was found that when the bank received the order from Acting President Li on February 17 to stop the transportation, it had already stopped the transportation. Although the amount transported accounted for two-thirds of the total amount of deposits, the gold and silver currently in Shanghai are still substantial and sufficient to meet needs. Furthermore, the destinations such as Taiwan and Guangzhou are all within the country, so there is nothing inappropriate. (2) The China Textile Corporation case is divided into two parts: A. Chairman Liu Weichi's use of 18 million yuan of public funds: It was found that the funds were allocated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for evacuation purposes; the funds were used for public purposes, which is legitimate, and Mr. Liu has no responsibility. B. The standing director's house purchase matter: It was found that Liu Weichi was not aware of this matter beforehand, nor did he approve it. It was purely an unauthorized action by Guo Yingying, the secretary of the board of directors, so he should bear full responsibility. The Supervisory Office has now notified the police station to detain Guo and release him on bail, awaiting legal action. (3) Xu Shiyuan, an investigator from this office, was arrested recently in a case of "conspiring to riot and subvert the government." After sending personnel to Beijing for investigation, the office believes that the procedures for arrest by the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters were improper, and that the case was not transferred to the court for trial afterward, which is unconstitutional. Therefore, a protest has been lodged with the Garrison Headquarters.

### Robbery of Passengers on a Boat and Murder Committed, Five Robbers Convicted Yesterday and Sentenced Separately

[Report from Our Newspaper] Hua Zhongpin, who had been unemployed for a long time, together with Xian Yupin and seven others (still at large), carried guns and conspired to rob on April 9, 1947. They purchased tickets in Ningbo and boarded the Hua'an ship sailing to Dinghai. When the ship reached the vicinity of Zhenhai, they took out their weapons together. Gu Yupin first shot and killed three policemen and one passenger in military uniform on the ship with a gun. They forbade the passengers on the ship from moving, searched the items carried by each passenger, robbed 120 million yuan in legal tender and gold ornaments, and fled together on a small boat that had been booked to pick them up. In December of the same year, together with Zhang Caixin, Huang Huiding, Shi Xiangsheng, and others (still at large), they carried guns and robbed many fishing boats near Dinghai, robbing more than 3 million yuan in legal tender, more than ten dan of white rice, and more than thirty jin of fish. Zhang Lizhong, together with others (still at large), used weapons to rob several million yuan of legal tender, four bags of free rice, nine cans of kerosene, and many cartons of cigarettes from ships sailing near Dinghai in July of the same year. In February of last year, they were arrested one after another by the police sub-bureaus of the three municipalities and transferred to the local court for trial. Yesterday, Judge Zhu Yuhuang sentenced: Liu Zhongpin was sentenced to life imprisonment for jointly robbing and intentionally killing people, and deprived of political rights for life. For jointly intending to illegally possess property, using violence and coercion to make it impossible to resist and taking other people's property, he was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment and deprived of political rights for ten years. Zhang Caixin, Shi Xiangsheng, Zhang Lizhong, and Huang Huiding were jointly sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment and deprived of political rights for ten years each for jointly intending to illegally possess property, using violence and coercion to make it impossible to resist and taking other people's property. Yuan Xiaofu was found not guilty.

### University Professors' Association to Discuss Salary Issues Tomorrow, Calculating Salaries Based on the Cost of Living Index is the Minimum Requirement

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai National College and University Professors' Association is scheduled to hold its fifth meeting at the Shanghai Business College tomorrow afternoon. Liu Dajie, a spokesperson for the association, said yesterday: The visit to Beijing by the presidents of national colleges and universities in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Suzhou to request improvements in the treatment of faculty and staff and to increase the amount of public funding for students has yielded considerable results. The association would like to express its gratitude to the presidents for their hard work. The association previously requested the acting president to improve treatment by multiplying the original salary without any discount by the price index. Later, the presidents of the schools in Beijing revised it to calculate based on the cost of living index. Now, President Sun and Acting Minister Chen have indicated that the original salary must be discounted, and the matter of calculating according to the cost of living index must be discussed by the Executive Yuan before a decision can be made. The association's opinion on this matter will be discussed at the standing committee meeting to be held on the scheduled date. However, it must be stated in advance that calculating the treatment of faculty and staff according to the local cost of living index is the minimum requirement and cannot be compromised further. The current five hundredfold payment can only be used as a supplementary payment for February, and the salary for March must be based on the cost of living index announced for that month.

National Bank to Allocate a Portion of Funds and Grain Storage Fees for Various Schools First

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the presidents of sixteen national colleges and universities in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places went to Beijing to petition, the Executive Yuan agreed to allocate funds and grain storage fees in Shanghai. However, because the person in charge of the national treasury of the Ministry of Finance is not currently in Shanghai, they will have to go to Nanjing to complete the procedures. To this end, the presidents of the schools visited Liu Gongyun, the president of the National Bank, the night before to discuss the matter. President Liu agreed to complete the procedures and allocate the funds in Shanghai. However, because the National Bank had tight funds yesterday, it could not provide such a large amount of cash, so it temporarily allocated a portion first, and the rest will be collected by the schools within a few days.

In addition, the Executive Yuan allocated more than 400 million yuan in grain storage fees for the sixteen schools for three months, which was calculated at the market price of 17,000 yuan per dan at the time. Now that the price of rice has risen above the 20,000 yuan mark, using the funds to purchase grain will likely not reach the original figure of six dou per person.

### Senators Request Recall of Order for Public Utilities to Be Priced in Customs Gold Units

[Report from Our Newspaper] In opposition to public utilities being settled in Customs Gold Units, City Senator Zhang Zhongyuan sent a letter to Mayor Wu, requesting a recall of the order. The original letter roughly stated: "Customs Gold Units" are a currency for taxation, and the Ministry of Finance stipulates that they are only applicable for calculating customs duties. After public utilities use Customs Gold Units as an adjustment calculation standard, rents and prices can be used as an excuse to follow suit, and the Gold Yuan is equivalent to being nominal.

### Liu Shan Kang and Two Others Sued for Forging Checks to Purchase US Dollars

[Report from Our Newspaper] Businessman Liu Shan Kang and Tang Mingzhong knew Chen Kun. One afternoon in January this year at 3:30 PM, Bai Tong Tang Mingzhong approached Chen on the pretext of purchasing US dollars. Through Tang's introduction, he handed over a forged 1,080,000 Chongqing Commercial Bank check to Chen and purchased 3,000 US dollars. Because Chen had to deliver the goods the next day, in addition to being defrauded of the change due, he lost 14,000 yuan in cash, a check for 96,000 yuan from the East Asia Bank, a check for 10,000 yuan, and a security deposit of 960,000 Gold Yuan.

After being transferred to the local prosecutor's office for investigation, it was believed that Liu Shan Kang, Tang Mingzhong, and Nan Xuemin were guilty of forging valuable securities and were prosecuted according to law.

### Frauds Abound, Intercepting Cars to Swindle Poplin, Six Gangsters Arrested

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhou Yifeng, the assistant manager of the Yongchun Cotton Cloth Store at No. 16, Lane 229, Zhejiang Middle Road, suddenly had Chen Yongming, whom he knew, come to the store at around 10:00 AM on the 26th of last month to purchase fifty bolts of striped poplin. He immediately gave a postdated check for 1,450,000 Gold Yuan and asked Zhou to help deliver the goods. He hired two rickshaws, each loaded with 25 bolts of poplin. Each rode one of the vehicles. Chen's rickshaw was in front, and Zhou's rickshaw followed behind. When the rickshaws reached the intersection of Caishi Road and Fuxing Middle Road, a young man named Wang Naixiang suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, deliberately intercepted Zhou's rickshaw, tore his gown, and argued with the rickshaw puller. At that time, Chen's rickshaw in front was nowhere to be seen. Fortunately, Zhou had been vigilant beforehand and had written down Chen's rickshaw number, 1377. Suspecting that Wang was colluding with Chen to commit fraud, he called the police, who took them to the Songshan Road Sub-Bureau and transferred them to the Laozha Police Bureau. After questioning by officers Li Minsheng and Tang Zhiliang, Police Chief Liu Zongtong immediately ordered police officers Miao Dejin and Shen Yanjun to investigate. It was found that the rickshaw puller with number 1377 was named Wu Yinggui. He was found and interrogated. According to his statement, the passenger ordered him to go to the entrance of the Jindu Theater on Foch Road and transferred to another rickshaw with another person. Later, the investigating police officers learned that the rickshaw number was 1070 and the puller's name was Xu Jinxiang, who lived at No. 8, Lane 154, Yongjia Road. He was found and brought to the bureau for questioning. He confessed that he had gone to a cloth stall at the intersection of Julu Road and North Zhongzheng 1st Road to unload the goods. The next day, the police officers disguised themselves as customers and secretly investigated the cloth stall, and as a result, they found five stolen goods. The vendor's name was Xu Changgen, and he was arrested. Xu led them to the home of his accomplices Xu Jinliang at No. 76, Jinxian Road, and Xu was also arrested. Xu led them to the Rundachang Cotton Cloth Store on South Zhongzheng 1st Road, where they found ten stolen bolts of striped poplin. Then they went to No. 45, Maoming South Road, Hengmaohe Sauce Garden, and found ten stolen goods. Finally, they went to Room 208 of the Lushan Hotel on Julu Road and arrested the principal offender, Chen Yongming. Based on Chen's confession, accomplices Zhang Liansheng and Yu Junhou were also arrested. They all confessed to colluding to commit fraud (including Wang Naiping). They also confessed that on January 15, they used the same method of issuing bad checks to defraud Jiang Yaping, the manager of Tianfengtai Cotton Cloth Store at No. 15, Guanghua Lane, Ningbo Road, of forty bolts of floral broadcloth and two bolts of Qilichou. Later, the victim, Jiang Yaping, was summoned to the case to testify, confirming that he had been defrauded and harmed by Chen and others, and requested severe punishment according to law.

### Striving for Heavy Industry: Yang Jihui's Unwavering Dedication for Fifteen Years

— Cui Mofei

Anyone familiar with the history of the rise of heavy industry in the Southwest cannot but admire Mr. Yang Jihui’s silent efforts and diligent spirit over the past fifteen years. Yang, whose given name is Fangyu, is from Feiyang, Sichuan, and a graduate of the third class of the Army University. He is the director of the Ordnance Factory No. ×××.

He leads this infant of heavy industry, an unprecedented undertaking in the Southwest. Amidst immense difficulties, he nurtured this child and contributed the utmost to the war effort. The hardships and suffering involved are beyond the imagination of ordinary people. Without Yang's extraordinary courage and patience, he would not have achieved today's success.

Looking Back

Fifteen years ago, Liu Fucheng (from Hunan), a man with great ambition, saw the intense civil war in Sichuan. While weapons and ammunition could be manufactured locally to some extent, raw materials (steel) had to be imported. He decided to build a steel plant in Sichuan to solve the fundamental problem. At this time, he invited Yang Jihui, a self-motivated graduate of the Army University, to oversee this arduous task. They selected a factory site amidst layers of mountains, built the factory buildings, and immersed themselves in hard work. After Liu Xiang's death, Yang resolutely handed over this "mother" of heavy industry in the Southwest to the central government, which became the authority in the iron and steel industry in the Southwest, a metallurgical giant.

Fifteen years ago, this place was a barren and desolate wilderness. But today, one sees only rows of chimneys and densely packed houses, the deafening sound of machines "kissing" each other. "Where there's a will, there's a way," Yang Jihui smiled. Fifteen years ago, he brought a group of cadres here to build the factory. He personally supervised the construction, living and sleeping at the factory, dedicating himself to a desperate struggle. Gradually, he pieced together those outdated machines and installed them, entering the experimental stage. Mr. Xiong Tianzhi was hired to oversee smelting and engineering. This middle-aged man, who studied mining and metallurgy in France, always had a smile on his face, wearing a blue cloth gown, living with the workers all day long. Gradually, with Xiong's assistance, his Gesi steel was produced from the furnace, and everything progressed better than before. After the factory was taken over by the central government, it was under the jurisdiction of the Ordnance Department. After the war of resistance entered its second phase, the seaports were blockaded, and raw materials and machinery could not be imported. The Ordnance Department was an independent unit, and everything had to be self-sufficient. Only then did Yang gradually become valued, and he himself became even more vigilant.

The Unsung Hero

At that time, a group of people who had been sent to Germany at public expense by the National Resources Commission (NRC) returned to China after completing their studies. Because these talents had studied mining and metallurgy, the NRC referred them to Yang. In fact, this group of people were the key personnel who were sent to Anshan and Taiwan to take over after the victory, namely Yang Shutang, Li Songtang, and Mao Henian, whom Sun Yueqi regarded as Chinese metallurgical authorities. After graduating from a German university, Yang Shutang interned at the Krupp steel factory of the German steel trust for a period of time, and then returned to this troubled motherland. He was sent to this infant of heavy industry amidst layers of mountains to begin work. He saw that the factory's equipment was outdated and the technology was backward, but he was moved by the director's hard work and perseverance. Once, in his capacity as an engineer, he asked Xiong Tianzhi, the director of the engineering department at the time:

"Why does it take so long for us to make steel?"

"The equipment is not good enough!"

"I can do it in half the time."

"You—don't be kidding!" Xiong Tianshe laughed, a laugh containing much excitement and encouragement. He knew that these people wanted to show their skills, but his habits and experience told him not to make a rash decision.

"Okay! You try it."

All the senior technical personnel responsible for the Ordnance Department arrived, hoping to witness a miracle in the history of Chinese metallurgy. At the scheduled time, sparks flew, and the heat was intense. The steel came out of the furnace and was sent to the chemical analysis department for testing. Everything met the standards in terms of ductility and hardness, but the time was reduced by half. Immediately afterward, Li Songtang pieced together a 28-inch rolling mill from machinery that had been removed from the Hanyang Arsenal and was considered scrap.

Qi Yun, who had earned a German national doctorate and had a clean face and gentlemanly demeanor, solved the problem of refractory materials that had not been solved in the history of Chinese metallurgy for decades. At that time, the refractory bricks used in steel furnaces had to be purchased in the United States and transported across the ocean via the Hump airlift. If the weather was bad and the plane was delayed, work had to be stopped to wait for the continuation of the material transportation. Qi Yun used some waste materials to make refractory bricks, which were as effective as those made in the United States, but the price was only one percent of theirs.

Without him, the heavy industry in the Southwest might have been delayed for another ten years.

Perseverance and Hard Work

When he turned fifty, the entire factory's staff had followed him for almost ten years, and everyone decided to hold a celebration. When this idea was conveyed to him by the workers' representatives and another senior staff member, he refused this kindness with a cold enthusiasm, saying:

"Don't forget what time it is now. The suppression of the rebellion is in full swing, and the front line needs more and more supplies. We should be stepping up production. I appreciate everyone's pure motives, but I reject this kindness." At this time, the vast masses of workers did not accept his opinion. They believed that if the director did not accept this suggestion, it would be tantamount to admitting that there was no emotional connection between him and the workers. The fire-like enthusiasm finally overwhelmed Yang's cold emotions. In a helpless mood, he accepted a souvenir, a pair of paper couplets.

In the thirty-first year, the enemy constantly bombed this only metallurgical equipment in the rear. Since air defense equipment could not be talked about, it had to be bombed. The number of bombings was too high, so the enthusiasm for rescue was also reduced. In one instance, when the factory was hit by incendiary bombs and fires broke out everywhere, he personally took the water hose to put out the fire, saying: "These things were all bought with the people's blood and sweat. Do you know what state the war of resistance would be in without these things?" He used a faint, non-aggressive voice, unwilling to be persuaded by others, and regardless of his own safety, he risked his life to rescue the machines.

Now, his wife has passed away. He lives in the factory every day and eats with the workers. He has no small kitchen, let alone a private cook. Perseverance and hard work—this is Yang Jihui's personality.

A Touching Story

After my fourth visit to the factory, I couldn't forget a heart-stirring story that was circulating among the vast masses of workers. Cui Zhixiong, a tall, gaunt, middle-aged man from Anhui who spoke fluent Sichuan dialect, was one of Yang's key cadres, following him for more than twelve years. He served as Yang's administrative secretary, capable of writing poetry and prose, a large brush calligraphy, a half bottle of old wine, capable and arrogant, with courage, but not good at ingratiating himself, claiming to be an honest official with character. Because of the salary issue, the Ordnance Factory had a relatively large welfare organization to solve the problem of workers' lives and daily necessities. When the previous director resigned, Yang ordered this veteran cadre to come out and shoulder this heavy responsibility. On the day he took office, he said to his subordinates in a very firm tone: "...From now on, we must resolutely change the problem of 'not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality.' Even if it is only a very small amount of something, we must ensure that everyone gets a little bit."

During the great bombing, he put on straw sandals and supervised the workers to rescue materials. At that time, the Ordnance Factory worked ten hours a day, but he often went at seven in the morning and didn't leave the office until nine in the evening. Two sesame cakes at noon were his lunch. During the war, the authorities allowed the workers' staple food to be allocated from the military grain, but the procedures for領取 were quite troublesome, so that it could not be received on time, and the poor quality of the rice was also an unavoidable fact. So a group of workers who were instigated went to his home to question him. At that time, he was having dinner, and his rice bowl contained a bowl of low-priced eight-treasure rice mixed with sorghum chaff and sand, with a bowl of boiled cabbage with no oil in the middle. It turned out that everyone, from the director to the small workers, ate this kind of rice, with no difference.

His approach convinced everyone and made them silently retreat. At this moment, one of his favorite children, because he was usually busy with official duties and neglected him, suffered from acute pneumonia. The doctor's diagnosis required a not insignificant sum of money. A very trusted clerk suggested to him that he withdraw a part of it from the public funds and slowly return it later, but he refused Huan Liangmei's kindness, saying: "Thank you, Ji, but I would rather let my child die than do such a selfish thing." The concept of 清廉節操 still occupies a not small place in his heart.

Bless Yang Jihui

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Yang Jihui went to various places in the East to visit, as a mirror for the expansion of the factory in the future. This inspection really made him feel mixed emotions. His own industry was too backward. The only thing he could be comforted by was that he had retained a group of talents for the country. Wherever there is heavy industry, there are Yang's old subordinates. Yang himself has been in charge of the metallurgical industry for fifteen years. With his spirit of diligence in learning, humility in asking questions, he seems to be able to squeeze into the ranks of experts today. After seeing the heavy industry in Taiwan, Shanghai, and the Northeast, he wrote a lecture draft of more than ten thousand words, pointing out the areas where metallurgical industry technology should be improved. He believes that during this suppression of the rebellion, the demand for military supplies has increased sharply, but he does not approve of increasing workers. He believes that technical talents should be few and of high quality. Rather than increasing workers, it is better to find ways to increase worker efficiency. Rather than waiting for US aid and reparations materials, it is better for us to do it ourselves first. He sincerely hopes that he can supply the industrial steel for the southwest in the future, and at the same time, he hopes that the by-product factory can also step up production, so that 洋釘鋼絲 and the like will not be in short supply in the southwest.

### Today's Zhejiang: Material Utilization Conference

— Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

We should question the Zhejiang Material Utilization Committee: What are the benefits to the local area after using the materials? How much effect has been achieved on the improvement and production of materials?

[Our Hangzhou 3rd dispatch] The Zhejiang Provincial Material Utilization Committee was founded when Chen Gongzhi was in charge of Zhejiang. This Material Utilization Conference is the embodiment of the material production control and sales committee of Chen's rule in Fujian, the Monopoly Bureau of the rule in Anhui, and the material adjustment committee. The original intention was because the provincial finances were insufficient, and the deficit was huge, and it was only possible to maintain it with the help of the central government, and there was no money left to handle emerging businesses, so the Material Utilization Committee was established to exchange materials or money from Zhejiang Province with other provinces to run businesses. The so-called material utilization, as we look at the words, should not only concentrate and control the export of materials, but should also have the task of improving materials. Only by making Zhejiang Province's materials tend to be excellent and standardized can we obtain the faith of other provinces, and then be happy to purchase and store Zhejiang Province's materials.

Business without Capital

At the beginning of the establishment of the Zhejiang Provincial Material Utilization Conference, Chairman Ren Xianqun said with a smile: "This is doing business without capital." Indeed, the Zhejiang Provincial Material Utilization Conference did not spend Zhejiang's administrative expenses, and was completely self-reliant. They tried their best to establish contact with the central financial and material institutions, first starting with purchasing Zhejiang's special products on behalf of others to establish credit, and then negotiated with the Central Bank to allocate a part of the working capital for their own use. They have already purchased 60,342 市担 of green ramie on behalf of the central government. Purchased and stored 31,180 市石 of food rice for the people (including 15,000 市石 approved to be priced for the Hangzhou Municipal Government and 440 市石 for the Zhejiang Salt Affairs Bureau, etc.), transported and sold 150,000 祖 of salt, exchanged for about 17,333 石 of Jiangxi rice, and purchased 73,514 large packages of 部糧購起糙米 and 21,219 石 of paddy rice on behalf of the Ministry of Food. Purchased and stored 520 担 of rapeseed oil and more than 180 祖 of rapeseed cakes, and purchased 156 担 of cotton. At present, the association's surplus in kind is more than 48,000 石 of rice, more than 93,000 担 of salt, and more than 500 担 of edible oil, with a total current value of 金圓500 million yuan. The numbers are not insignificant, but in this first session of the fifth meeting of the Zhejiang Provincial Assembly, Feng Wenqi, the acting chairman of the Material Utilization Committee, was severely criticized by the provincial assemblymen. And this time of questioning was also the most tense and enthusiastic one. They said that the Material Utilization Conference was competing with the people for profits, saying that it was using its power to forcibly purchase the grain stocks of various counties. But according to Commissioner Feng, "Operating under the principle of absolutely not competing with the people for profits, the Material Utilization Committee has not borrowed power. The grain stocks in various counties were originally surplus and needed to be sold, so it cannot be said to be forced." After the provincial assemblymen had a fierce debate, some advocated abolishing and liquidating the Material Utilization Conference. According to what the reporter knows, Zhou Fengzhang, the newly appointed chairman of Zhejiang Province, believes that the provincial treasury is insufficient, and the Material Utilization Conference can indeed enable Zhejiang Province's finances to obtain turnover, so there is no intention to abolish it.

Increased Production? Shrinkage

As mentioned above, the Material Utilization Committee we hope for not only concentrates and controls the export of materials, but also improves the materials and invests a part of the external sales into the original production business, so that production can continue to increase due to the relationship of the Material Utilization Committee, and not shrink due to the relationship of the Material Utilization Committee. Among the main businesses that the Zhejiang Provincial Material Utilization Conference has already handled, we know that they can be divided into purchasing and storing grain, purchasing and storing edible oil, and purchasing and selling green ramie and cotton. Today, the grain problem is indeed a very important problem, and storing grain for emergencies is also a matter of course, but when purchasing grain, we must have an understanding that the countryside has reached a state of decline and exhaustion. The surplus of grain stocks in the county is originally purchased cheaply by local influential people. Now that we are purchasing for the business of the entire Zhejiang Province's public, we may as well discuss with the county-level merchants to increase the price slightly higher than the original county's selling price, and use the higher amount to run rural businesses. The same is true for edible oil. When we purchase rapeseed, we should propose a certain amount of money as improvement funds. When rapeseed is used to extract oil, we should also propose a certain amount as the improvement cost of this oil extraction factory. The same method applies to green ramie and cotton.

Visit Production Areas for Investigation

The Material Utilization Conference should send personnel to visit the production areas at any time. The improvement and enhancement of rural life and production should be made into investigation forms as the basis for the quantity purchased in the next year, and it can also be seen that the export and utilization of materials has continuously increased production, and invisibly increased the wealth of Zhejiang Province. In today's Zhejiang, the items currently purchased and stored by the Material Utilization Conference are naturally very easy to generate profits. The Material Utilization Conference should go a step further to seek the prosperity of Zhejiang's special products, such as silk, tea, and tung oil, which are about to decline, which will be of greater benefit to Zhejiang's future. We believe that the Zhejiang Provincial Assembly should not support the Material Utilization Conference as competing with the people for profits, but should ask what are the benefits to the local area after the Material Utilization Conference uses the materials? How much effect has been achieved on the improvement and production of materials? And the Material Utilization Conference should not just focus on the success of the two sides' buying and selling in the form of an intermediary merchant, but should seek to find out what is the impression of this material export, and how to supervise the origin to improve, so as to obtain the faith of the sales area?

Future Business

Of course, the Material Utilization Committee contains the nature of public sales and the nature of centralized transportation and sales, but its centralized transportation and sales and public sales are operated by the public, and its profits can be returned to the public. However, if we ignore the active improvement of products when implementing centralized transportation and sales, the future of centralized transportation and sales will also be very bleak. We hope that the future business of the Material Utilization Conference should further strive for the outward sales of Zhejiang's special products.

### Ensuring the Northwest Gateway: A Dispute Between a Soldier and the People May Cause Ethnic Problems in Xinjiang

— Xie Zaisan

[Our Newspaper Report] Last year, I led the National Northwest University's Frontier Administration into various parts of southern Xinjiang, a round trip of 20,000 li, lasting four months. Upon my return, many friends asked me about the situation in Xinjiang and my impressions of the trip. Due to time constraints, I could not answer them one by one, so I have drafted this article to seek correction from those who care about the Xinjiang issue.

Importance in National Defense

Xinjiang is the largest province in our country, with an area of 1,641,554 square kilometers, about four times the size of Sichuan, eight times that of Hunan, and fifteen times that of Zhejiang, approximately the sum of the areas of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Suiyuan provinces. This vast area has unfortunately not been given attention by people in the interior. Such magnificent land is abandoned in the border regions, with no one caring about it! Let us look at the current state of our border areas: The Northeast is still in turmoil, Outer Mongolia has already become independent, Tibet is half-attached and half-detached, and what about Xinjiang? We have already seen that the northwestern corner of Xinjiang—the Yili, Tacheng, and Altay regions—has become special. How will we ensure the northwest gateway? This is a question that every Chinese person should be concerned about. Xinjiang borders Central Asia and has always been coveted by Britain and Russia, making it strategically important in national defense. Speaking of this, we might as well look back at history. Since Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty sent Zhang Qian to the Western Regions, it was a diplomatic strategy implemented to increase national defense capabilities, with the aim of attracting the allegiance of the Wusun and Dayuezhi countries to cut off the right arm of the Xiongnu. As a result, thirty-six countries within the Western Regions became affiliated, which was a great success at the time. During the reign of Emperor Ming of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Ban Chao entered the Western Regions and subjugated more than fifty countries, which was interrupted and resumed several times. During the Tang Dynasty, the Western Turkic Khaganate was pacified, and its territory was used to establish loosely governed prefectures, with the number of prefectures reaching several hundred. The Anxi Protectorate (in present-day southern Xinjiang) and the Beiting Protectorate (in present-day northern Xinjiang) were established, with heavy troops stationed there for management. The prosperous eras of the Han and Tang Dynasties all regarded the Western Regions as an important national defense stronghold. After the Qing Dynasty pacified the Dzungars, it established governors, ministers, counselors, and captains to govern the area. It was not until Zuo Zongtang pacified the Hui rebellion that Xinjiang was officially established as a province in the eighth year of the Guangxu reign, treating it as part of the interior. From then on, Xinjiang truly belonged to China, and our country's northwest national defense truly extended to both the northern and southern routes of the Tianshan Mountains.

The importance of Xinjiang's position in national defense was such in the past, and it is even more important now. The military authorities currently responsible for Xinjiang are also very clear about this. They understand that Xinjiang is the northwest gateway of China. If Xinjiang is lost, everything outside Jiayuguan will no longer belong to us, and the entire Northwest will also enter the horror of destruction. We have heard several military officers in charge say that their will to defend the territory is very firm, and they all said that not an inch of Xinjiang's land can be lost. This is correct. We must not take such an important place lightly.

What is the current situation in Xinjiang? I will now describe it as follows:

Political Democratization

Politically, Xinjiang has implemented political democratization. All commissioners and county magistrates in the province are elected by the people. Today, the interior has not yet implemented the election of local administrative officials, but it has already been implemented in remote Xinjiang. Those elected commissioners and county magistrates may be somewhat unskilled in administrative techniques, and the efficiency of their work may not meet the standard, but these public servants elected by the common people are indeed doing things and not being officials. They do not have any bureaucratic habits. Any county magistrate can talk to the common people as casually as ordinary people, and there is no separation between superiors and subordinates. In southern Xinjiang, we saw a county magistrate chatting with the common people at the gate of the county government, and his clothing and attitude were not at all like a bureaucrat. This made us, who are used to seeing county magistrates in the interior "ruling the country" and acting high and mighty towards the county people, feel strange. This one example shows that Xinjiang's politics is progressing upward. Because the county magistrates are elected by the people, most of the county magistrates are Uyghur. In southern Xinjiang, we only encountered three Han Chinese county magistrates, but their deputy county magistrates were still Uyghur.

The direction of provincial administration has already been explained. We have heard various opinions in Xinjiang. Although what they say is different and their positions are also different, their conclusions have gradually converged. Xinjiang has its own path and does not need to be the same as the interior.

Unity of All Ethnic Groups

The various ethnic groups in Xinjiang are gradually becoming more united. During the Sheng Shicai era, the ethnic groups in Xinjiang were divided into fourteen types. This division is now mostly considered inappropriate, so there is also the theory of dividing them into Turkic language family, Mongolian language family, and Chinese language family. This standard of classifying ethnic groups by language is more scientific, but because of this, the Turkic language family ethnic groups have become even stronger. The Turkic language family ethnic groups include Uyghur, Kazakh, Tatar, Taranchi, Tajik, Kyrgyz, and Uzbek, accounting for 80% of the total population of Xinjiang. In the past, we had a tradition of wanting to call the ethnic groups in the border areas as having the same origin as the Han ethnic group, sharing the same ancestors. There are constant records of this in our history books. In fact, this is very far-fetched. The combination of ethnic groups is not that simple and does not need to be forced. The existence of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang is a distinct fact. Of course, we cannot deny that Xinjiang is not an ethnic group. Speaking of the overall situation, there is no irreconcilable contradiction between ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province. It seems that Uyghurs and Han Chinese are opposed to each other. However, the incidents that have occurred in Xinjiang Province have mostly been the evil consequences caused by poor politics. Political incidents turn into ethnic struggles, and ethnic struggles cause diplomatic disputes. This seems to be a trilogy, forming an inextricable bond. Now, the Xinjiang Provincial authorities have seen the crux of the matter, so they are putting special effort into this area, striving to make politics enlightened and ethnic groups united. In the interior, a dispute between a soldier and the people is just a matter of discord between the military and the people, which is not a big deal. However, in Xinjiang, if a soldier quarrels with the people, it may cause an ethnic problem. We once saw a Han Chinese military officer quarreling with a Uyghur merchant on the streets of Kashgar. The officer raised his hand and beat the Uyghur merchant. At that time, the Uyghur merchant publicly announced, "What kind of army is this? Are the Han Chinese oppressing the Uyghurs like this?" This led to estrangement between ethnic groups. Such small things, accumulated over time, become resentment, and when the opportunity arises, the ethnic resentment will erupt. We once held a cultural symposium for young people of all ethnic groups. They all unanimously emphasized that all ethnic groups in Xinjiang should strengthen unity, and the way to unity is to respect each other's customs, religions, languages, and lives. This is a logical argument, and only in this way can all ethnic groups live together in peace.

People's Lives are Quite Good

At present, the people's lives in Xinjiang are relatively stable. The social order is good, and the living standards are also relatively prosperous. Especially in the southern Xinjiang area, the climate is mild, and agricultural products are abundant, with no shortage of food. This prosperous scene can be seen from the supplies of the garrisoned troops. The food for the troops stationed in the northern part of Xinjiang is transported from Gansu (in order to reduce the burden on the people, food is transported thousands of miles). However, the food for the troops stationed in the southern part of Xinjiang is raised locally. The soldiers are well-nourished, and each meal has meat, which is not easy to obtain for the troops stationed in the interior. The national troops we encountered all said that they ate well there and that their clothing was quite neat. For example, in the garrison in Baicheng, each soldier has a pair of riding boots, which are originally products of their own tannery.

Kazakh and Uyghur Ethnic Groups in Northern Xinjiang

The Kazakhs in northern Xinjiang live a nomadic life. Cattle and sheep roam the fields, carefree, and free to live and multiply, living a leisurely life. In Tianchi, we visited a Kazakh family. Their attitude toward life is that they do not worry about scarcity. Melons and fruits are everywhere, which is rare in the interior. The lives of Kazakh and Uyghur compatriots are so good, and the same is true for Han compatriots. Most Han Chinese live in cities, and public service and business are their constant occupations. Because the local area is stable, life is not as poor and miserable as compatriots in the interior who are constantly in the midst of war. At a minimum, they can maintain a family of five. Han Chinese who are engaged in agriculture in northern Xinjiang are not subject to crop failures, and their lives are better than those of farmers in the interior. Cities and villages have a prosperous atmosphere. It is unexpected that in our country, which is full of war, there is still such a quiet place.

Rich Resources Buried Underground

Xinjiang's rich resources are not on the surface but underground. According to preliminary investigations, the reserves of coal, iron, and oil rank first among all provinces in the country. This is just a preliminary investigation. Of course, there are many undiscovered mineral deposits. We saw a large coal mine near Yanqi, where the coal seam was exposed on the ground, but no one cared about it. The oil in Kuche and Kashgar is inexhaustible, and the locals refine and use it using indigenous methods. Gold mines can be mined at any time, and people say that gold can be mined somewhere. Iron ore is available everywhere. Yingjisha and Kuche have been famous for producing knives since ancient times, that is, their local iron is produced and they have very good steelmaking handicrafts. Between Wensu and Baicheng, there is a salt mountain, hundreds of miles from east to west and 200 meters high, which is entirely a salt mountain. When we went to visit, we saw this salt mountain and felt that Xinjiang is always endless treasure. Isn't this a good foundation for building a chemical industry in Xinjiang? This salt mountain is inexhaustible. The abundance of mineral deposits in Xinjiang shows that this place is suitable for developing heavy industry. We expect the country to have a way to quickly develop this "uncultivated virgin land." If the border is safe, the national defense will be secure.

Development of Culture and Education

Xinjiang is most suitable for developing culture and education in a stable environment. Newspapers and magazines in the interior can also be seen in Dihua, and the Northwest Cultural Construction Association is particularly committed to the construction of Xinjiang culture, publishing various publications related to Xinjiang. These developments in modern culture are certainly worthy of praise, but the inherent cultural life of the various ethnic groups is even more amazing. Uyghur compatriots are good at singing and dancing. Regardless of gender or age, they can all express their artistic talents. We saw the singing and dancing of young girls and the dancing of eighty-year-old men. When a five-year-old child performs a solo dance, he wins a round of applause.

Hometown of Singers and Dancers

Miss Cambarah, who is famous in the interior, is not a top-notch talented singer and dancer in Xinjiang. Southern Xinjiang is known as the hometown of singers and dancers. Every time the "Lang Yuanzi" season comes (summer, when walnuts are ripe, every family holds a garden dance party, commonly known as Lang Yuanzi), we can see the colors of true fruit country culture, which are beautiful, happy, and express the joy of men and women living in the oasis. We once saw a song and dance performed by a Miss Pacha Khan in Yisu. She was only sixteen years old and studying at a normal school. With graceful dance and melodious singing, she is truly a talented singer and dancer. We are not saying that Uyghur songs and dances are only worth watching and listening to. We should pay more attention to the fact that these songs and dances are part of the actual lives of Uyghur compatriots. In their lives, if songs and dances are removed, it would be an unimaginable thing. True art cannot be separated from reality, and the artistic life of Uyghur compatriots is true life. We believe that in Xinjiang, we should do our best to promote the cultures of all ethnic groups and supplement them with education, so that the education and cultural undertakings in Xinjiang will flourish.

Three Major Policies for Border Governance

In Lanzhou, General Zhang Wenbai once said to us that to solve the Xinjiang problem, we must first eliminate the past prejudices against the border areas, such as Han chauvinism or assimilation policies. He has analyzed in detail the mistakes of past border policies and pointed out the path to be followed in the future. His views are still the best policy for border governance today, but in the end, he sighed and said, "There are three ways to solve the Xinjiang problem at present: (1) Actively develop and promote economic and cultural development, so that Xinjiang compatriots can live a comfortable life. (2) If development is not possible, then let Xinjiang compatriots decide their own destiny, autonomy, independence, let them choose. (3) Maintain the border by force and strengthen national defense. Now, none of these three paths can be implemented: Firstly, the country has no money, how can it develop? Secondly, we are not willing to give up this great land casually. Thirdly, the country does not yet have this power. Then we can only maintain the status quo and wait for the future!" Zhang Wenbai's conclusion is correct, let us wait and see what the future holds. We feel that this place in Xinjiang needs the efforts of the Chinese people. Its future destiny will be determined by our national destiny.

### Tragic Gambling Arrest in Dangtu: Dispersed Soldiers Kill Villagers

[Our Newspaper Dangtu Second Dispatch] In Lingying Township, Dagong District, Taixian County, several poorly armed and disorganized soldiers arrested gamblers along the way a few days ago, causing public resentment. They were surrounded in Qian Tang Village, and two soldiers were captured alive. It is reported that a short gun and a long gun were seized. The remaining soldiers escaped and fled to Zhangjiadian. A farmer, Wu Zigao, encountered them head-on and was shot in the neck by the soldiers and died soon after.

### Gold and Silver Market to Resume After Implementation Rules for New Plan are Passed Market Organization May Follow Stock Exchange Model

[Our Newspaper Report] Regarding the issue of opening the gold and silver market, a related party revealed yesterday that the entire set of measures is still in Finance Minister Xu's pocket. It is said that the resumption of the gold and silver market is only a part of the implementation rules of this financial reform plan. The opening of the gold and silver market this time is obviously different from the method of selling gold during the Song Ziwen and Bei Zugi era, but rather to restore the gold and silver market that has been closed since August 13, so that gold, silver, and silver dollars can have a formal and public trading market. The organization of the market may follow the current stock exchange model. Members participating in market transactions must be recognized and qualified experts, and must pay a fixed amount of margin. Therefore, the operating and management rights of the market will be the responsibility of the private sector as much as possible. The financial authorities may send supervisors to the site for supervision in the same way as the current stock exchange. The related party emphasized that after the restoration of this open market, all transactions of gold, silver, and silver dollars will be able to operate in accordance with established and legal rules. The National Bank authorities will also be able to exert their open market buying and selling policies to stabilize the prices of gold, silver, and silver dollars. It is expected that after all the implementation rules are passed and implemented by the Executive Yuan, the gold and silver market in Shanghai will begin to prepare for restoration.

### Rice Market Fluctuations Narrow Market Situation is Weak in the South and Strong in the North Edible Oil and Miscellaneous Grains Struggle to Recover

The rice market yesterday saw uneven strength and weakness in the northern and southern markets. In the southern market, due to slightly tight money supply, sentiment was very weak, and opening prices were slightly lower by 100-200 yuan. White japonica rice retreated to 19,400 yuan, and thin japonica rice to 19,500 yuan, each down 100 yuan. Early rice fell by 200 yuan to 19,200 yuan. White yuan and Yin yuan remained at their original prices. In the northern market, prices were slightly stronger due to high prices in the producing areas. White japonica rice rose by 200 yuan, and early thin japonica rice rose by 200-300 yuan each. A total of 7,742 piculs arrived in the two markets.

Flour

After rising, it saw a pullback. In the early market, the upward trend continued from yesterday. Northern merchants continued to receive goods strongly, and military flour once rose to 8,650 yuan, and old car flour to a maximum of 9,150 yuan. In the later market, with the overall weakness of various items outside the circle, it was rumored that the Central Bank was secretly dumping goods, and sellers were very willing to sell. The market situation was unsustainable. Old car flour closed near the 9,000 yuan mark, and military flour closed at 8,400 yuan. Wheat bran also fell by 100 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

Turned weak and fell. Only soybeans, under the rumors of the lifting of the export ban, foreign merchants came again to patronize. Car soybeans once rose to 18,000 yuan, but after hearing that oil cakes had turned flat, they retreated by 500 yuan. Raw peanuts initially fell sharply by 10%, but after foreign merchants inquired and soybeans became strong, they rebounded by 3,000 yuan. Other corn, red miscellaneous sesame, etc., fell by about 10% amidst the general decline of various items.

Edible Oil

Fluctuated and declined slightly. Initially, due to the decline in rice prices, it also fell by 2-3,000 yuan. Soybean oil opened at 74,000 yuan, and in the middle market, it once rebounded to a high of 77,000 yuan. At the close, it fell again due to the decline in off-market prices. At the close, soybean oil was 74,500 yuan, a squeeze of 1,500 yuan. Rapeseed oil fell by 2,500 yuan, and Jilong's raw oil was stable. Soybean cake was flat and weak, with Changzi cake at 7,700 yuan and Lizi cake at 7,500 yuan. There were few buyers at the close.

### Oil and Grain Association Requests Lifting of Southern Transportation Ban on Oilseeds

Regarding the case of the ban on the southern transportation of edible oil and its raw materials, it was previously expressly abolished, and then ordered to be banned again for one month. The deadline has now expired. The Miscellaneous Grain Association and the Oil Association believe that the edible oil and raw materials required in various parts of South China mostly rely on the Shanghai market for supply. Since the ban on transportation for several months, not only has the business of members been greatly affected, but they also feel that they are willing but not legally allowed to respond to the requests for assistance from various parts of South China. Now that the deadline has expired, the association and others jointly submitted a request to the Municipal Government today to consult the Jianghai Customs and quickly restore southern transportation to facilitate the flow of goods and benefit industry and commerce.

### Money Supply is Steady with a Hint of Buoyancy

Yesterday, the money supply in the local market showed a steady trend with a hint of buoyancy. The interbank lending rate was between 70 and 80 yuan per day. The demand for funds was still very strong, and the supply was also abundant. Because the current interbank lending rate is too high, many merchants are willing to sell goods and lend out money for interest, and there is also a large supply outside the industry's banks.

### Exchange Bureau Yesterday's Transactions

[Report from this newspaper] The National Exchange Bureau released $63,600,000 yesterday, while various banks involved in the large exchange put in $59,040,000. Foreign businesses put in $56,288,000, and various banks involved in the small exchange released $47,592,000.

### State-Owned Enterprise Stocks to be Listed Sequentially

Following the Taiwan Sugar Corporation (台糖公司) stock and the 38th Year Gold Bond (卅八年黄金公債), stocks of state-owned enterprises such as the Textile Construction Company (紡建公司) and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) will soon be listed for trading. According to the responsible authorities, trading of Taiwan Sugar Corporation stock on the stock exchange has yielded good results since its listing. In order to strengthen the absorption of idle capital, the authorities are expediting preparations for the listing of Textile Construction Company and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company stocks. Various tasks are gradually becoming concrete, and realization is expected in the short term. The 38th Year Gold Short-Term Bonds have already been listed and opened for bidding yesterday. In addition, the 36th Year Gold Bond will also be listed for trading soon. The successive listing of government securities has provided the government with another avenue for absorbing idle capital. In the future, the work of selling securities will be carried out simultaneously with the allocation of other materials, in a coordinated manner.

### Financial Institutions Applying to Use Capital; Financial Supervisory Authority Approves Two More

[Report from this newspaper] The Financial Supervisory Authority (金管局) continues to receive over forty applications from financial institutions applying to use increased capital funds. Yesterday at 11:00 AM, the Bureau held its 17th routine meeting with the Audit Division of the National Bank Operations Bureau (國行業務局稽核處) to review each application. In addition to approving the use of funds for two financial institutions, totaling $300,000, the remaining applications were for extensions of deadlines.

### Loan Cases Approved by the Committee on Subsidies for Industry and Mining; Eight Cases Passed

The Industry and Mining Advisory Committee of the National Bank's Discount and Loan Committee held its 32nd routine meeting at 3:00 PM on the 4th. More than twenty committee members attended, chaired by Cai Gongchun (蔡公椿). Eight loan cases were passed, including those for Chongqing Electric Power Company (重慶電力公司), Guilin Hydropower Plant (桂林水電廠), and E-Yi Coal Mine Company (鄂一用煤礦公司). After the meeting adjourned, the 15th routine meeting of the Production and Export Enterprise Loan Review Committee was held, chaired by Zhu Tongjiu (朱通九), and two loan cases were passed.

### List of Goods for This Year's Trade with Japan Submitted by China Trust for Review

According to sources at the Central Trust Bureau (中央信託局), since the announcement of the Financial Reform Plan (財政金融改革方案), the government has been drafting a new trade plan with Japan in order to align with this new plan and promote the development of international trade, with the initial goal of expanding trade with Japan. The Central Trust Bureau has now compiled a list of goods that China can ship to Japan in exchange, and a list of goods that China needs Japan to ship to China, and has submitted it to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (工商部) for review. Once approved by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, promotion can begin immediately. However, before the government's plan is finalized, no significant developments will occur in any business.

### Tung Oil Skyrockets

Yesterday's Tung oil market saw frantic buying activity, fueled by the frenzied rise of foreign exchange transfer certificates, frequently stirring excitement. Sellers seized the opportunity to raise prices, with the trend becoming increasingly sharp. While other commodities were leveling out, the Tung oil market repeatedly surged, setting a new benchmark.

### Gold Bonds Debut; Chinese Stocks Stagnant

Gold bonds debuted yesterday. According to regulations, the opening price was $155,000, the high price was $170,000, and the low price was $150,000, with a fluctuation range of $20,000. The closing price in the morning was still $155,000. Most of the sellers were from banking circles, and most of the buyers were from the Guangdong community, with a total transaction volume of 628 taels. Because it was Friday, buyers had to bear two days of interest. The overall environment was calm, and new buyers hesitated due to concerns about high interest rates, resulting in a shrinking and stagnant market. There was little change in stock prices, and the amount of fluctuation was less than the previous day. Near the close, news of loosened credit and covering of short positions led to a rebound, but the market ultimately closed with flat and stable prices. New Asia (新亞) once reported a limit-up increase, and Zhenqi (振漆) also closed at the limit-up, with increases ranging from one cent to three dimes and five cents. Yongye (永業) rose four dollars. Fourteen stocks fell. Taiwan Sugar (台糖) suddenly reported a limit-down drop midway through the day, reflecting a reaction to its eleven consecutive days of increases, with a drop of $520. Other stocks also fell by a small amount, ranging from half a cent to one dime. The total turnover for the half-day reached 3.951 billion, including 112.5 million shares of Yongshen (永紗).

Afternoon

Gold bond trading takes place from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM daily, and the market is closed on Saturday afternoons. The half-day transaction volume was 281 taels, with a high price of $161,000, a low price of $157,000, and a closing price of $159,400. The sellers were still mostly from banking circles, and the buyers were mostly from the same industry.

### Foreign Stocks Weaken

The foreign stock market has turned from firm to weak. Credit in the circle was tight yesterday, major players retreated, and retail investors followed suit, resulting in a market roughly half a percentage point lower than the previous day. Yisha (怡紗) traded at $7,200, down $300 from the previous day. British & Chinese Corporation (英聯) was also weak, trading at $7,700. Jardine Matheson (會德豐) saw no trades, and Asia Navigation (亞洲航業) traded at $700 and $720, down over $100 from the previous day. Other stocks generally fell by half a percentage point.

### Taiwan Coal Production Expected to Increase This Year

According to visitors related to the Taiwan Coal Mining Industry Association (台灣煤礦業同業公會), last year's coal production in Taiwan was only 1.7 million tons due to repeated wind and flood damage. This year, it is estimated to increase to over 2 million tons. If various machines and the number of miners can be increased, production can be further increased. Currently, the export of Taiwan coal is still controlled by the government, and the annual quota allocated to Shanghai is over 50,000 tons, Guangzhou 13,000 tons, Xiamen over 1,000 tons, and Fuzhou 2,000 tons. This number is still insufficient compared to the actual needs of various regions. Efforts need to be made to increase it in order to promote trade between Taiwan and the mainland. As for Hong Kong, there has been no quota in the past. It is reported that the industry association hopes to exchange Taiwan-made coal for machinery or other materials needed by Taiwan to develop coal mines in Hong Kong, and is currently sending personnel to negotiate.

Coal Prices Rise Again

[Report from this newspaper] The price of Keelung coal at the Four Mines Joint Operation Office (四礦聯營處) also rose yesterday due to the adjustment of the New Taiwan Dollar price. The new price is $65,920 per ton, up $3,670 from the old price. Other foreign bituminous coal remains unavailable and there is no market. White coal briquettes and grade ten remain at the original price.

### Tea Market Trend Exuberant

Since the continuous price increases in the city, yesterday's market sentiment was generally cautious, so attitudes were not as strong as in the past, and the rising trend stopped. However, the tea market was not restricted in the slightest, and instead, unanimously reached its peak, because the sellers felt that costs were rising sharply, and at the same time, they inherited the latent power of the previous day's rise, which was still insufficient, so they began to stir after opening, and gradually raised prices. By the close, prices had risen considerably. Transactions that had been sluggish for many days remained untransformed in the midst of protracted negotiations.

### Sugar Market Fluctuation

Yesterday's sugar market rose first and then fell back, with a slight increase at noon closing. No. 45 refined white sugar was $37,500, up another $500. Coarse granulated sugar was $36,700, also up $700. Xinghua (興化) white and red sugar, etc., all rose slightly by about $500 to $700. The industry had absorbed too much in the past few days and was saturated, but because dismantling interest rates were too high, holders held on, and transactions were flat in the soft market, with no significant gains or losses compared to the previous day's noon closing.

### Market Stroll: Watching Taiwanese Visitors

Financial tensions between the United States and Britain: South Africa and Britain Take Advantage of the United States

The International Monetary Fund stipulates that the world's pure gold price is US$35 per ounce. However, South Africa, a signatory country, recently specially produced gold with a slightly lower quality, and sold it at US$38.5 under the guise of gold products. South Africa's suzerain state is Britain, so South Africa's move was initiated by Britain.

The mainstay of the International Monetary Fund is the United States. The fund is vehemently opposed to South Africa's move, which is clearly instigated by the United States.

Since the victory over Germany, the open and covert struggles between Britain and the United States over currency and trade have intensified daily. This struggle is just one of many open and covert struggles.

In previous struggles, the United States sometimes won, and Britain sometimes won.

For example, in the beginning of the victory, Britain wanted to borrow gold from the United States, but the United States discounted it by 20% or 30%, and developed the Marshall Plan to aid Europe before lending it to Britain. This was a victory for the United States.

When the United States lent money to Britain and other European countries, it hoped that the currencies of various countries would be re-priced according to the black market exchange rate. Because the official prices of various countries were higher than the black market prices, this condition of the United States was intended to force various countries to devalue, shake the currency credibility of various countries, and further increase the control power of the United States' gold dollar diplomacy. Britain firmly opposed it, and the United States had to abandon this condition. This was a victory for Britain. This time, South Africa is selling gold at high prices, and the financial war between Britain and the United States has begun again. Although the consequences are not yet predictable, in the near future, the world's gold prices and international exchange markets will be greatly changed, and the general trend has been determined by this matter. Originally, Britain has the world's largest gold mine, and the United States has the world's largest gold reserves. Britain has more futures, and the United States has more spot goods. Britain is like a distant water that cannot quench a present thirst, so it is extremely poor. The United States can deliver spot goods immediately, so it can exert the power of its gold dollar diplomacy. This time, Britain's instigation of South Africa to sell gold at high prices is intended to step up gold mining and quench its current thirst. The United States opposes South Africa in order to ensure its own gold dollar diplomatic power.

South Africa's high-priced gold sales have implicitly lowered the value of the U.S. dollar, because the world's gold prices are calculated in U.S. dollars. In the past, the United States forced the pound to depreciate, but Britain refused. Now that Britain is attacking the value of the U.S. dollar, the United States will naturally fight back with all its might.

However, no matter how much the United States and the Fund oppose it, South Africa has its own reasons, because US$35 is the price per ounce of pure gold, and South Africa's selling price is gold coins with different fineness, so it does not admit that it is a breach of contract.

In fact, the price of pure gold is US$35; the price of mixed gold is US$38.5. South Africa's reason is equivalent to taking advantage of the United States. The United States and the Fund have been taken advantage of.

### Cotton Yarn Initially Flat, Then Firm; Cloth Market Trend Stable

Yesterday's cotton yarn market was initially flat, then firm. Sporadic transactions in the Guangdong community were not deserted, and most sellers remained optimistic. Buying interest was still weak, but most people in this street were watching. Especially with tight credit, buyers were worried, resulting in a rising market.

42-count Blue Phoenix (藍鳳) initially opened at $1.17 million, then rose to a high of $1.25 million, and finally closed at $1.24 million, up $60,000. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose $50,000, closing at $1.21 million. 32-count Silver Moon (銀月) opened at $850,000 and finally rose to $900,000, up $40,000.

21-count Double Horse (雙馬) spot goods rose from $670,000 all the way to $720,000, closing at $700,500 at noon, up $25,000 from the previous day. Factory orders (廠單) were last traded at $670,000, and 20-count Double Horse was $655,000, also up $25,000. Other brands such as Golden City (金城) and Celestial Maiden (天女) also showed their beauty. 16-count Brightness (光明) broke the $600,000 mark, closing at $600,500, up $15,000. Other markets were firm and stable.

The cloth market presented a fluctuating situation, because after the peak of the previous day, new buyers were ultimately hesitant due to high prices, but major players, in view of the opening of transport to the south, were unwilling to sell easily, so prices were generally stable.

Dragon Head (龍頭) fine cloth opened in the morning at the same price as the off-market bid price in the afternoon of the previous day, at $30,750. Later, because general retail investors were cautious about rising prices and sold at high prices, it was ultimately difficult to resist the force, so they abandoned the $30,000 mark and gradually fell to $28,800, down $1,000 from the previous day. Loudspeaker Child (喇叭童) fine cloth fell slightly by $400, closing at $27,500.

In addition, B Dragon Head (Ｂ龍頭) and Five Blessings (五福) fine cloth also fell into the low range. Four Gentlemen (四君子) plain serge opened at $29,100, then rose to $29,300, and finally fell slightly to $27,200, down $1,000. Golden Lotus (金蓮) yarn serge fell $500. Most other cloths did not move. In the afternoon, because credit within the industry loosened, off-market bid prices rose back to the noon closing price of the previous day.

### China Textile Sells Yarn

[Report from this newspaper] China Textile Construction Company (中國紡建公司) sold yarn yesterday as usual, offering nine types, totaling 48 pieces. 27 households were approved to purchase, with a value of $53,320,000.

The selling prices of various counts of yarn were: 8-count Sunlight (日光) $340,000, 14-count Water Moon (水月) $560,000, 32-count Sunlight $850,000, 32-count Double-Strand Harvest (雙股豐年) $1,100,000, 40-count Shebao Light (社寶光) $1,120,000, 42-count Double-Strand and 40-count Triple-Strand Red Treasure Light (三股紅寶光) both $1,150,000, 60-count Palace Maiden (宮女) $1,700,000, and 80-count Double-Strand TK Colored Ball (雙股ＴＫ彩球) $3,650,000.

### Timber Firm and Stable

In the timber market, fir prices are firm and stable due to reduced supply, but the price increase of foreign goods still lags behind. Currently, fir is $120 per foot, foreign pine is $300 per foot, and Liu'an plywood is $1,900 per sheet.

### Silk Flat

Yesterday's artificial silk market turned flat. The yarn and cloth market outside the industry was mediocre, and the gold and banknote market rose first and then fluctuated, and people were calm. Credit in the market was "slightly" looser yesterday, but market interest rates were still between 70 and 75. Holders of goods were cautious about high interest burdens. As a result, the market was mediocre. The 120-day bridge opened on the same-day position at 930,000 to 940,000. There was a strong intention to sell in the middle, and it once fell back, but after hearing that the gold price had softened and then strengthened, idle capital from outside the industry entered, and buying interest increased, and it closed at the million mark. In the afternoon, credit loosened, and off-market gold prices rose slightly with interest. The market was still stable, but because general prices had risen sharply in recent days, the trends of various industries were weak yesterday, and the large silk market was no exception, so bid prices rose slightly.

The raw silk market was quiet yesterday, and major players were mostly watching. Although credit had eased, hidden interest rates were not low, so digestion was weak. Superior grade was first traded at 1.2 million and then at 1.22 million, down 30,000 from yesterday afternoon. Grade D was 1.25 million, also down a small 30,000. The trends of other grades were flat. In the afternoon, there was not much fluctuation in various off-market goods, and the gold and banknote market also rose slightly with interest. The market was still flat. Grade D was quoted at 1.27 million to 80,000, and superior grade was quoted at 1.23 million to 40,000.

The opening trend of silk fabrics and quilt covers was still flat. The factory did not open any goods, and most of the market was arbitrage trading. Mayer (美亞) was first traded at $675,000. After opening, because dismantling interest rates were still high, retail investors mostly sold. The market once softened, falling as low as 630,000 to 640,000. Later, off-market gold prices fell and then rose, but ultimately fluctuated between 191,000 and 193,000, and the market trend was unlikely to improve. People in the industry were also mostly watching. It closed at $645,000 near noon, down more than $20,000.

### Joint Operation Office Initially Decides Exchange Rate for US Aid Cotton

[Report from this newspaper] The US Aid Cotton Committee (美援棉花委員會) and the US Aid Chemical Yarn and Cloth Joint Operation Office (美援化紗布聯營處) held another joint meeting yesterday afternoon. Regarding the exchange rate for the third phase of US aid cotton, the technical team reported on the process of studying the exchange rate. Based on cost estimates from various sources, there were several options for the cotton poundage exchanged for one piece of 20-count standard yarn, such as 621, 624.5, 632, and 643 pounds. After serious discussion, it was generally decided to be 624.5 pounds, and it will be submitted to the technical team for review and approval this morning.

### Municipal Industry Publishes General Overview of Shanghai's Sulfuric Acid Industry

Sulfuric acid is the most important basic industry, and its consumption reflects the prosperity of the entire industry. It is also closely related to agriculture and national defense. Electrification fertilizers, such as ammonium sulfate and superphosphate, and explosives for national defense, all require mutual quantities of sulfuric acid. Other industries such as machinery dyeing and weaving, cotton spinning, underwear knitting, enamel, leather making, papermaking, copper materials, towel sheet finishing, bleaching and dyeing, and wool spinning all require large quantities of sulfuric acid. Perfumes, dyes, instruments, stationery, gasoline lamps, photography, plate making, hardware, nickel sulfate, chromic acid polishing, oil glue wood, camel wool pharmaceuticals, etc. require less sulfuric acid, and the monthly statistics require about 1,000 tons. As for those who use sulfuric acid as a raw material to manufacture hydrochloric acid, the monthly demand is uncertain. At most, it can reach 400 tons. At present, due to the sluggish industry, the total amount of sulfuric acid required should be less than 600 tons. Currently, there are four sulfuric acid manufacturers in Shanghai: Xinyue (新業), Zhonghua (中華), Tiangong (天工), and Jiangsu (江蘇). Xinyue uses the latest contact method equipment, and the results are very good. Tiangong is a self-designed contact machine, which is quite rare. Jiangsu Pharmaceutical Factory belongs to foreign merchants and uses the lead chamber method, which is relatively old. Although Zhonghua is a lead chamber method, it has a larger output. The annual production volume of the above four factories last year is as follows:

Zhonghua 3,600 tons (maximum production volume is 5,400 tons).

Jiangsu 1,360 tons (maximum production volume 2,376 tons).

Tiangong 720 tons (maximum production volume 836 tons).

Xinyue 1,530 tons (maximum production volume 4,032 tons).

The current production volume of the above four factories is a total of 7,210 tons per year, or about 600 tons per month. The maximum production volume is 12,638 tons, or about 1,000 tons per month, which is sufficient for the current needs of various industries in the city.

The raw materials for manufacturing sulfuric acid include pyrite and sulfur. The domestic production of pyrite is quite abundant, but due to unstable production areas and transportation difficulties, it cannot be as smooth as expected. The most abundant domestic sulfur is in Taiwan, but the quality is poor and the quantity is small, and it is necessary to rely on the supply of imported products. Xinyue and Tiangong sulfuric acid factories in this city use pure sulfur, and Zhonghua and Jiangsu use both pyrite.

The largest use of sulfuric acid is the manufacture of fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate and superphosphate. Domestic fertilizer plants, such as Taiwan Fertilizer Company (合灣肥料公司), Yongli Ammonium Sulfate Plant (永利硫酸錏廠), and Post-War Relief Rural First Demonstration Factory (善後事業鄕村第一示範工廠), directly use the produced sulfuric acid to manufacture fertilizers. Sometimes the remaining sulfuric acid is transported to this city for use by various industries. According to domestic sulfuric acid plants, dozens of them are largest in scale and equipment in the Huludao Assets Committee Sulfuric Acid Plant (葫蘆島之資委會硫酸廠), which can produce 1,500 tons per month. However, due to the impact of the war, it is temporarily suspended. The sulfuric acid plant of Taiwan Fertilizer Company, although large in scale, has older equipment and can produce 350 tons of concentrated sulfuric acid and 300 tons of dilute sulfuric acid per month. However, the container problem has not been resolved, and it cannot be transported to Shanghai as much as possible, which is a pity.

### British Newspaper Praises Malayan Badminton Team

[British News Agency, London, 4th] The "Glasgow Herald" published an article by a sports reporter on the 2nd, reviewing the Malayan badminton team's performance in the Thomas Cup. Regarding the final against Denmark, the article said: "The rather arrogant Danish captain Skalup (史加洛普), i.e., last year's All-England singles champion, never recovered after his first defeat, and it was easy for Malaya, the victor of the International Badminton Championship, to win." Regarding the semi-final against the United States, it said, "The most outstanding features were the performances of Feliman and Lovette. Mantz's two glorious defeats at the hands of Huang Bingshun and Huang Defu, and the superb skills of Malaya's best doubles team Zeng Guanliang and Yang Decai were witnessed by 6,000 people on the court. The fierce battle between Malaya and the United States will be listed among the greatest matches in badminton history."

### Stimulating the Singapore Football Scene: "Disguised Amateurism"

[Associated Press, Singapore] A rather familiar pathology in the sports world has recently been discovered here, shaking the entire Singaporean football scene. Here, it is called "disguised amateurism."

Recently, a sports enthusiast, using the pen name "Open Door," wrote to the Straits Times, pointing out that the current pathology in the football world is a shocking fact that needs to be washed away with a surgical procedure. He said, ("Disguised amateurism" is indeed a fact, and is well known to football players and football club staff here). In addition, he also stated four stains in the football world to prove that the Singapore football world has indeed been invaded by germs.

(1) A player injured his muscles, so he asked a masseur to massage him. The actual massage fee was S$2 per session. After five sessions, he recovered, but the bill he issued was for a total of ten sessions, S$3 per session. So he had a profit of S$20 (each Singapore dollar is worth US$0.475).

(2) A player claimed to have an internal injury, so he asked a traditional bonesetter "Mr." to treat him, at S$5 per session, but when billing, he would bill his parent club S$20.

(3) Before the competition, a star player would express "pay the money, otherwise please face the facts," and the staff in the meeting, in order to make him perform his best, had to give him rich hospitality to seek his emotional harmony), so that he must have a good performance in the competition.

(4) Star players want to have star positions. In fact, each club is secretly fighting to see who can give the better players better positions.

The editor of the Straits Times made the following reply to this accusation:

Regarding the current epidemic in the Singapore football world, we express our deep sympathy to the letter writer, but we can also say a few more pieces of evidence, one of which is also considered the most suspicious, is the fact that someone once asked a certain number of players to send "retention fees" in the last session.

### Shanghai Police's Rotation Strategy: Air Force High Altitude Team Suffers Initial Defeat; Unfamiliar Field Leads to Missed Shots

[Our Reporter] The Capital Air Force High-Altitude Artillery First Regiment basketball team played against the Shanghai Police last night at the City Gymnasium. It was their first game in Shanghai, and the stands were filled with enthusiastic uniformed comrades. The Shanghai Police won with their fast-paced play, with a final score of 44-33. The halftime score was 25-17. The Shanghai Police were familiar with the court and had the upper hand throughout the game. The Air Force High-Altitude team's performance was not bad, but they sometimes paid too much attention to their form. Coordination and passing need improvement, and they missed many shots, probably due to unfamiliarity with the court. The team only had six players available last night, which was also a disadvantage. In contrast, the Shanghai Police team had many players and used a rotation strategy, appearing more energetic. Before the main game, there was a friendly match between Jianle and the Police Machinery team, which Jianle won 38-35.

The Air Force High-Altitude team's players were Ling Jinghuan, Chen Chaozhu, He Ronglu, Yang Baijiu, and Li Lijin. The Shanghai Police team's players were Wang Rongsheng, Shi Jiuquan, Fu Qixia, Wang Bowen, and Liang Yongbiao. After the start of the game, the Shanghai Police took the lead, with Yongbiao scoring a goal, Bowen scoring two free throws, and Jiuquan adding points, making it 6-0. The Air Force High-Altitude team quickly called a timeout. Ling Jinghuan started to get into the game, but the Shanghai Police added three more points. Chaozhu scored a free throw, and Bowen made long-range shots from both sides of the court with ease. At 5-18, Huang Jianguo replaced Baijiu for the Air Force High-Altitude team, and Chen Shensi and Sun Moxi replaced Rongsheng and Jiuquan for the Shanghai Police. Suddenly, the Air Force High-Altitude team's momentum increased, with Jianguo and Chaozhu pressing forward, turning the situation around. At halftime, the Shanghai Police led 25-17.

The Shanghai Police did not relax in the second half. Jiuquan scored, and the guest player Li Yujin responded in kind. Chen Chaozhu scored another goal. Yongbiao and Rongsheng returned the favor, each scoring two goals, making it 35-21, further extending their lead. The Air Force High-Altitude team had many shooting opportunities, but they failed to score because they were too focused on their form. The Shanghai Police replaced Bowen with Moxi, and the Air Force High-Altitude team replaced Jianguo with Baijiu. The Air Force High-Altitude team struggled to finish the game, and the guest team lost their first game with a final score of 44-33.

### Joe Louis Autobiography (2)

— Translated by Canglong

But when my stepfather took me to Detroit to study, things were different. My grades weren't even up to sixth grade, and I was one of the biggest students in the class. But after school, I worked part-time on an ice truck, earning a dollar a day. I often carried fifty to seventy-five pounds of ice up several floors, and I never worried about these heavy tasks. I thought it helped my boxing and made me grow. And I gave the money I earned to my family. In the evenings, I often hung out with a bunch of local ruffians on a street corner. We fought often, but not very seriously.

I dropped out of school because of my poor grades, but a teacher at the new school saw right away that it would be better to reshape my hands than my mind. And he was right. I learned to do carpentry work. I made good furniture, from small tables to bookshelves to cabinets. My family needed these things, so I took them home. Unfortunately, the American economy began to decline, and my stepfather lost his job. My mother had to go to the relief agency and stand in long lines to get some relief money for us each week. I kept track of this money, which totaled $270. Later, in 1934, I won $1,300 in the fight against Charlie Massera and paid back that $273 in one go!

At the age of sixteen, I began to be interested in boxing. In the school gym, I put on gloves like the other students. At that time, I thought that maybe I would become famous because of this. Every night, my classmates and I talked about the wealth of those boxers. A classmate, Mckinney, who was one or two grades above me, told me that if I participated in amateur boxing matches, I could get commodity checks worth seven to twenty-five dollars per match. Mckinney himself was the Michigan amateur lightweight champion.

At the time, I was still learning the violin, but after five or six lessons, I started skipping class. I used the tuition money to pay for amateur boxing fees. Eventually, this was exposed by my violin teacher. I told my mother: I want to be a boxer, I don't want to be a violinist. My mother didn't insist either. She often said that if any of her children wanted to do something in this world, she would work as much as she could to help us achieve our goals. Soon, I found a job at the Ford Motor Factory.

Around 1932, I first appeared in the amateur boxing arena. At that time, I weighed 168 pounds, and they wanted me to fight a white boy named Miller. Miller had attended the World Games and was very experienced. He knocked me down seven times in two rounds. This was the most times I had been knocked down in my boxing career. That night, I was sore all over and felt dejected. But I still got a seven-dollar check, which I gave to my mother.

This stage was tricky enough, but I was improving every day. In my two years of amateur boxing, the records show that I won forty-three times by knocking out my opponents, and seven times by points. But I also lost four games. My opponents in this stage were all second-rate. The bandages on my hands were used over and over again after several fierce battles, because I really didn't have the money to buy new ones. I didn't have boxing shoes either, so I had to make do with old tennis shoes. Also, I didn't eat well. My family had no connection to steaks and pork chops, which are essential for a heavyweight boxer, but they were too expensive. At most, I could only enjoy my favorite sausages.

In 1934, I won the Detroit lightweight championship. A man named Rothspan, who was very interested in black boxers, began to notice me. He told me that if I worked hard and lived a serious life, he would help me. So I studied with him. He took me to his house to live, woke up early and went to bed early, treated me very well, gave me a lot of clothes to wear, ate with me, and often helped me out, giving me five or six dollars a week. He bought me boxing shoes, making me feel comfortable everywhere, so I continued to dominate in the boxing matches that followed.

My last amateur boxing match was on June 12, 1934, in Detroit against Beaucho. That time, I defeated Beaucho in the first round. After that, I asked Rothspan if I could turn professional. He took me to Chicago and introduced me to Jack Blackburn, who was my coach in every fight for the next eight years. Almost everything I know about boxing was taught by him. (To be continued)

### Guan Yuan, Silver Dollars, and Gold Yuan

— Cao Zhi

The new prices for public utilities such as water, electricity, gas, and trolley cars will be calculated and charged in "Guan Yuan" starting in March.

"Guan Yuan" is still a new term that most people haven't heard of. They still think it's the old "Guanjin," which was only worth 20 legal tender yuan. However, this is not the case. This Guan Yuan is a big deal, originally worth forty US cents! So, to put it more clearly, it means that public utilities will be charged in Gold Yuan certificates converted from US dollars.

The reason for doing so is said to be to "avoid the impact of the devaluation of the Gold Yuan certificates." The statement is correct, of course, but it makes it difficult for public and private employees who only have Gold Yuan but no Guan Yuan.

At the time of the economic reform (referring to this time, I can't remember which time it should be), it was originally said that civil servants would be paid in silver dollars, which inevitably made the civil servants, who were already so hungry that their faces had turned green, dream of Yuan Datou, which could jingle and shine in the streets of Henan. But unexpectedly, as the days passed, this matter seemed to be no longer mentioned. What they received was not "silver" yuan, but still "gold" yuan—but unfortunately, it was followed by the word "certificate."

Water cannot be avoided, nor can electric lights. Trolleys, for the sake of eating, have to be taken. But money, it is to be "calculated according to the Guan Yuan." Holding a few Gold Yuan certificates that are devaluing every day, you have to go to the end of the month to pay for the Guan Yuan that stubbornly refuses to devalue. Our civil servants have to learn from some master magician to do it!

As I write this, I see a report in the fourth-day newspaper that a person in charge of the Gold Management Bureau told reporters that a small number of shops in this city are actually pricing goods in silver dollars. As such, "not only is there a suspicion of forcing customers to use silver dollars for payment, but it is also sufficient to hinder the currency system and disrupt finance, and should be strictly prohibited," and so on.

Absolutely, absolutely! But what about public utilities? Isn't it openly and legally approved to sell their "goods" by pricing them in Guan Yuan? What price in silver dollars is only a "small number of shops", but what price in Guan Yuan is all public utilities! Isn't that "hindering the currency system and disrupting finance," and shouldn't it be "strictly prohibited"?

Moreover, silver dollars, whether they are large-headed, small-headed, dragon dollars, or boat dollars, are still Chinese money used by Chinese people; and what "Guan Yuan" is forty cents of foreign money. Isn't this even more "hindering the currency system and disrupting finance," and shouldn't it be even more "strictly prohibited"!

### Lobbying

— Nanwu

Although the trend of lobbying is said to be very strong now, it has existed since ancient times. It was lively more than thirty years ago. Fortunately, everyone still remembers it, so there is no need to go into details here, so as not to be redundant.

But the foreigners also do the same thing. In May 1934, the US Senate was in session to discuss a rather important "Bankruptcy Act." At that time, there was a notoriously corrupt senator named Gray Wolf, nicknamed "Blue Fish." As soon as this public official saw that the bill was unfavorable to him, he joined forces with a senator named Flea Len to oppose it as much as possible. But despite all their talk, it was difficult to escape justice, and they suffered a series of miserable defeats. Seeing that it was about to be passed by vote.

At this time, Gray Wolf was anxious and came up with a plan. When it was time to vote, he began to debate endlessly. The speaker of the US Congress cannot stop speeches. Gray Wolf's purpose was to delay time, so he talked nonsense and rambled on about everything under the sun. Once he stood up, he spoke for three hours in a row. The other senators knew that he was deliberately making trouble, and no one bothered to listen to his nonsense. They couldn't help but "draw lots" and quietly slipped away. In a moment, Gray Wolf was the only one still talking loudly in the meeting place. Next to him, only his accomplice Flea Len was sitting and listening respectfully to the grand remarks. In addition, there was only Speaker Gibson.

At this time, Gray Wolf suddenly made a ruthless move. He said: "Okay, are there only a few of us left? Let's vote on this case"!

Speaker Gibson was so anxious that he lost his mind, but according to the US rules of procedure, the speaker could not suggest checking the number of attendees. It was clear that Gray Wolf could succeed in his plan.

Unexpectedly, at that time, a senator named Bai Qumen suddenly rushed in through the door, and someone was yelling at Bai Qumen behind him: "Quick, quick! Quickly request a check to see if the number of attendees is sufficient"!

Bai Qumen made a suggestion as usual, and Gibson was naturally overjoyed, but Gray Wolf was greatly disappointed. He was so angry that he said to the person behind Bai Qumen: "Okay, let's settle the score later"!

Who was the person behind Bai Qumen? He was the number one red person in the US Congress, Secretary Pipur, who was also one of Truman's most trusted confidants. This public official is good at lobbying to benefit the people. It cannot be said that it is a messenger, and it is also an example of "the moon is better in a foreign country."

### Yuan Shikai and His "Big Head"

— Subei

"Yuan Datou" won the "Silver Dollar Champion", it is said to be indeed because of the sufficient silver content and good color. I have not tested Yuan Tou, so I dare not rashly praise him; but there are three facts that prove that the saying that Datou is authentic is roughly correct:

(1) According to the Central Mint, Datou has the best color among various silver dollars;

(2) The exchange price of silver dollars stipulated by the Communist Party of China's People's Bank is the highest for Yuan Tou;

(3) In recent months, some people have expressed deep doubts about Yuan Tou's value and have specialized in buying eagle dollars and small heads, but Datou has not declined slightly as a result.

If so, then Yuan Shikai, although he is already a decadent dross in the history of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai's head is increasing in popularity because of its authentic color and prestige. His deep popularity is exactly the same whether it is "north and south" or whether people are "left or right". The "boat dollars" that the government is rushing to build in large quantities today will be inferior to "Yuan Yang". Yuan Shikai's reputation has been ruined for 30 years, but unexpectedly, 30 years later, the silver dollars he mainly cast have authentic color and have a "hundred-year machine" effect. The "Yuan rebel" in the ground will probably secretly rejoice and raise his eyebrows and exhale; but when we look at it from the entire political and economic history, it is inevitable that we will have a feeling of "one generation is not as good as the next". Even if Yuan Shikai's rebellious deeds are obvious and have long been concluded, "Yuan coins" do not cut corners and do not reduce materials, but are very popular with the people today.

At least, in terms of casting silver coins, Yuan Shikai did not take the opportunity to "steal chickens" and exploit the people. Even Yuan Shikai, who was so absurd, quite understood the principle of leaving love to the people.

### A Mixture of Laughter and Tears

— Lin

On the morning of March 1, A said to B, his neighbor who came to borrow the newspaper every day:

"Congratulations! Congratulations!"

"What is there to be happy about?"

"The newspaper has risen from sixty yuan to one hundred yuan, and you can save another one thousand two hundred yuan a month, shouldn't that be happy!"

### Birthday Candles

— Yu

A dancer in the dressing room boasted to her companions about how lively her birthday was last night.

"Wow, that cake was so big and so beautiful! There were seventeen candles on it!"

"Seventeen?" her companion asked. "What, were you lighting them at both ends?"

### Reading Mr. Gong Zhan's Article "From Peace to Buddhist Warmth and Abstinence from Killing" Written for the Disaster Relief Association

— Huang Xuanweng

Buddhist music enters hell, sincerely saving all living beings. Although the scriptures are subtle, I fear the world will be shocked. To present them in a plain way, they seem obscure but are actually clear. Good and evil are originally different, inevitably leading to struggle. Force cannot stop war, but rather moves the world's soldiers. Does literature value emptiness? Drawing water requires clarity. Who sacrifices himself to save the world? I belong to Mr. So-and-so. Mr. is a descendant of Anren, surpassing the indifference of the Supreme Being. Having fulfilled his aspirations in Buddhism, he does not count success or failure. Success is as heavy as Mount Tai, failure as light as a feather. Exerting oneself for the nation, making it a process of struggle. Dealing with matters with impartiality, analyzing principles with utmost sincerity. Looking at the blood on the battlefield, recalling the sounds of the slaughterhouse. We are all descendants of Yan and Huang, why must we emulate sea whales? The wall has been crossed for three years, leading the masses to call for peace. Eight days before the Awakening of Insects in the year of Ji Chou, written at the Jin Ye History Pavilion in Shanghai, at the age of seventy-five.

### The Way to Make Money

— Oriental Jing

A man in our city was crushed to death by a car. He had neither insurance nor savings during his lifetime, leaving behind a widow who was three months pregnant, which was quite pitiful. But this young widow politely declined all assistance, she 2: I have a plan. When the child was born, she stayed in the best hospital in the city and received the best care. I asked her what kind of plan she had.

She said: "It's very simple. I sell a kind of lottery ticket, one US dollar each. I give half of the number of lottery tickets sold to the winner. I take half myself. Friends from Harlem helped me sell this lottery ticket, for a total of five thousand tickets."

"How do you draw the lottery?" I asked her.

"Every person who buys a lottery ticket can guess a birthday. Whoever guesses the birthday that is closest to the birthday of the child I will give birth to in the future will win the prize."

### Quite Instructive

— Wei

A certain ethnic group in South Africa has a law on speeches: Every speaker must retract one foot and perform the golden rooster independence posture as soon as he begins to speak. If his foot touches the ground, he must stop immediately and step down.

It seems that our National Assembly may also consider adopting it.

### Shanghai Old Tales (1) - A Record of the Three Moves of the Racecourse

— Gu Qi

The racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road and Ma Hoke Road covers hundreds of acres. If you look down from the chessboard of the International Hotel, you can see green grass, endless at a glance. In the center of the prosperous commercial area, leaving such an open space unused is really a pity. In the past, during the meetings of the Senate, it was said that it was also mentioned that a price would be offered to recover it, or that suburban land would be exchanged, and the original site would be changed into a public gathering and sports venue, but in the end, the money that was opened up was frightening, and it was abandoned.

The racecourse is organized by foreigners and has a board of directors, which was established in 1850. But at that time, the racecourse was not in the current location, but at the corner of Nanjing Road and Henan Road, covering 60 acres, as a place for horse racing and ball games. People generally called it the "Old Park". In 1854, as commerce gradually developed, land prices in this area rose rapidly. Seeing that there was a profit to be made, the board of directors sold this land and bought another piece of land between Zhejiang Road and Tibet Road for horse racing. People generally called it the "New Park". Later, land prices in the surrounding area also rose, so it was sold again, and the racecourse was moved further west, which is the current racecourse. This was in 1862. Because of the large profits made from buying and selling twice, the land purchased for the last time was also much larger than the previous two times.

In his book "Miscellaneous Writings", Huang Mengwuan also has a passage about the racecourse at that time. He said: "Western merchants living in Shanghai have horse racing games in the spring and autumn seasons every year, closing the wide field at the west end of Dama Road, surrounded by fences for more than ten miles, planted with sand and soil, and fine grass is connected, endless at a glance. On the day, they stand on horses with bridles and brocade turns in one color, the conch sounds, and the horses run like flying, from three or four horses to more than ten horses. Every time they must run for three days. After the run, there are also flower flag frame games, and the viewers are like the sands of the Ganges, and the sisters of the teaching workshop, without exception, drive horse-drawn carriages and arrive in teams. The tourists seem to have met before, and they are not prohibited from talking to each other, it is truly a great pleasure." From this, one can also imagine how grand the occasion was at that time.
