### Director He Arrives in Shanghai from Hangzhou: Exchanges Views on the Current Situation with Leaders of the People's Party and the Youth Party; Final Decision on the New Cabinet List Not Yet Made

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 13th] He Yingqin and his wife were originally scheduled to return to Nanjing this morning on the 'Zhuiyun' special plane dispatched by Acting President Li, but due to deteriorating weather conditions today, they changed their travel arrangements and took a special train at 8:50 AM via the Lianglu Railway to Shanghai to return to Nanjing. Sun Lianzhong, Leng Xin, Chen Jicheng, and others traveled with them. Those who came to the station to see them off included Zhou Lei, Peng Zhaoxian, Zhang Qiang, Xuan Tiewu, Yu Jimin, and others.

[Our Report] The newly appointed Premier of the Executive Yuan, General He Yingqin, arrived in Shanghai yesterday noon by special train from Hangzhou. He will stay here for a day or two to exchange views with the leaders of the People's Party and the Youth Party on the current situation, and to invite them to join the new cabinet to jointly support the precarious situation. He expressed that it would be especially welcome if peace representatives from Shanghai, such as Yen Hui-ching and others, could accept the invitation to join the cabinet. Premier He and his family departed from Hangzhou at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, accompanied by Sun Lianzhong, Chen Jicheng, Jiang Dingwen, and others. The train arrived at the Fanhuangdu West Station at 12:45 PM. More than ten municipal leaders who went to welcome them included Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Chairman Fang, and Director Mao. A press conference was held at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, and at around 4:00 PM, Premier He attended a symposium with members of the Central Committee staying in Shanghai at the City Bank. Those who attended included Fang Zhi, Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Gu Zhenggang, Liu Gongyun, Zhao Dihua, Cheng Cangbo, Hu Jianzhong, Zhang Fang, Zhang Zhiben, Liu Duoquan, and more than twenty others. They offered several suggestions on the current situation for the new Premier to consider. Yesterday, He met with Zhang Qun, Gu Zhenggang, Xu Kan, and others at his residence, and held separate discussions with them. Premier He issued the following written statement: "This time, I am grateful for Acting President Li's nomination and the Legislative Yuan's trust in entrusting me with the task of forming a cabinet. I am aware of my limited abilities and fear that I will not be able to fulfill the task. However, the situation is difficult and dangerous, and all difficult problems need to be resolved. I will go to Nanjing within the next few days to exchange views with all parties, hoping to gather talented people and jointly plan national affairs, and to use the spirit of unity and innovation to seek political improvement and the realization of peace." In addition, He also gave oral answers to the questions raised by reporters, stating briefly that the list of the new cabinet has not yet been finalized and will be made after exchanging views with all parties. He will stay in Shanghai for several days to invite the People's Party and the Youth Party to join the new cabinet. He also stated that after the establishment of the new cabinet, he hopes that peace talks and political reform can be carried out simultaneously. However, he stated that he has not yet studied the rumor that the British Labour Party system would be adopted. He did not give a definite answer to the issue of demobilization and the number to be retained, which is of concern to the public, only saying that if peace can be achieved, all problems can be easily solved.

If I am too optimistic, I may be disappointed in the future. If I am too pessimistic, it may still succeed. However, I served as the plenipotentiary representative for negotiations with the Communists before the war. At that time, both sides had already signed an agreement. If this agreement could be strictly observed, today's events would not have happened at all, and there would have been no need for the Political Consultative Conference three years ago." Chen expressed that He Yingqin's premiership of the Executive Yuan was very much in line with public expectations.

However, I will continue to work hard to promote peace in my spare time."

### Two Ships Sail from Hong Kong to Tianjin: Conducting Exploratory Voyages

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 12th] It is reported that most Chinese and foreign shipping companies here still maintain a tentative or wait-and-see attitude towards the resumption of transportation and trade with Tianjin and other ports under Communist control. Because the Communist authorities lack a concrete trade policy, most companies here can only send exploratory ships to Tianjin and Yantai. The ships scheduled to sail to Tianjin on the 12th include the 'Grant' and the 'Oriental Merchant'. The former is 1,800 tons and the latter is 1,000 tons. The 'Hunan' will also sail to Tianjin recently. Merchants here hope to learn what materials the Communist side is willing to exchange.

### Xue Dubi Summoned to Nanjing

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] State Policy Advisor Xue Dubi arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 13th, after being summoned by Acting President Li.

### Beiping Type (II)

— Jiang Xue

(A report on a city before and after "local peace")

It is said that when Changchun and Shenyang in the Northeast were abandoned, Mao Zedong sent a representative to Beiping to explore peace talks with Fu Zuoyi, hoping to resolve the North China issue through political means. This representative stayed in Beiping for more than ten days, but did not receive a concrete answer from Fu Zuoyi, and left in disappointment. After the Communist army surrounded Beiping and Tianjin, the Communist army used a broadcasting offensive to urge Fu Zuoyi and commanders at all levels to send representatives to negotiate. Zhou Beifeng once represented Fu Zuoyi to leave the city to make contact. But at that time, Chahar Province had not yet been lost. Fu was confident that he could still fight, and was not eager to seek peace. Later, because of the loss of Chahar Province, the main force was completely lost. Military force is the political capital of soldiers. When the strength is gone, they have to consider the next step, and then send Deng Baoshan and Zhou Beifeng out of the city to make contact. After the end of the Tianjin battle, Beiping was completely isolated. In addition, the defeat of the Huaihai Campaign caused Nanjing's political market to decline day by day. Bai Chongxi and Cheng Qian in Central China also had a series of contacts, which prompted Fu Zuoyi's determination to negotiate peace, and the undercurrent of peace talks was concretely and actively underway.

On the other side of the undercurrent of peace talks was the social peace movement initiated by prominent figures. For example, four senators from Tianjin left the city to negotiate peace. Before the peace talks yielded results, the Tianjin battle had ended. Many celebrities and scholars in Beiping also called for peace to preserve the ancient capital's cultural relics. There was an organization called the Peace Promotion Association. Fu Zuoyi also repeatedly invited professors from universities in Beiping to solicit their opinions on peace. There was also an episode in which He Siyuan, the former mayor of Beiping, flew from Nanjing to Beiping, vigorously promoting the peace movement, and became a news figure for a while, but received two time bombs as the price. Fortunately, the bomb on his wife's roof exploded first. He ran to his wife's room after hearing the explosion, resulting in the death of his second child, and he, his wife, and his children were all injured. If the bomb on his own roof had exploded first, he might have lost his life! However, He Siyuan was not discouraged by this, and still participated in the peace delegation with injuries to make contact with the Communist army outside the city. During this negotiation, He Siyuan vigorously defended Fu Zuoyi's thoughts and actions, and had a debate with the Communist army personnel, but returned without any concrete results. In fact, these actions were just superficial gestures or affectations, and the actual decisions were still being made in secret.

Deng Baoshan and Zhou Beifeng, dressed in civilian clothes, met with Lin Biao, Nie Rongzhen, and Ye Jianying of the Communist army, and negotiated concrete solutions. But Fu Zuoyi still wanted to see how the overall situation in the country was changing, and whether the Central Government had better solutions to offer. So he delayed and did not announce or resolve to implement it. The Communists criticized Fu Zuoyi for lacking courage, saying that he had no courage at all. Since the President issued the New Year's Day message, to the end of the defeat of the Huaihai War, the Yangtze River was in danger, and the unconditional armistice was announced, Nanjing's political market plummeted. After Fu Zuoyi received the news that President Chiang had decided to telegraph his resignation, he also decided to accept the Communist army's terms for local peace and announced that he would implement them. This was Fu Zuoyi's painstaking effort, because this approach seemed very acceptable to Mr. Chiang and the Central Government.

On the evening of January 22, the spokesperson of the North China Pacification Headquarters formally announced the thirteen key points of the Beiping local peace plan, the main points of which were: (1) The National Army in the city will withdraw to designated locations outside the city and be reorganized within one month; the Communist army will also withdraw thirty miles. (2) The provincial and municipal governments will continue to perform their duties as usual, pending reorganization. (3) A joint office will be established to handle all relevant matters between the two parties. (4) The Gold Yuan Certificate will continue to be used. (5) The safety of life for public and education personnel will be guaranteed. (6) Postal and telecommunications agencies will continue to operate as usual. (7) Newspapers, news agencies, and propaganda agencies will continue to publish and re-register. (8) The safety of people's lives and property will be guaranteed. (9) People have freedom of religious belief. ... etc. According to what the Communist army said after entering the city, the contents of these key points are not very complete. However, after these thirteen key points were announced, public and education personnel and the public seemed to have taken a reassurance pill and felt relieved! Everyone was glad that Beiping could avoid the disaster of artillery fire, and that individuals could be guaranteed the safety of their lives and property, so they continued to live their lives as usual. As for political gains and losses, and how the future will change, of course, they will consider it in the next step.

On the 22nd, when the news of the realization of local peace in Beiping spread, prices once plummeted. Silver dollars fell to 180 Gold Yuan Certificates per dollar, and each bag of flour for military ships was only worth three silver dollars. However, after the newspapers published the thirteen key points on the morning of the 23rd, prices continued to rise and gradually returned to their original state. Later, silver dollars actually rose to 2,500 yuan each. (To be continued)

### The New Cabinet Will Immediately Consult with the Communist Party: The Beginning Date of Peace Negotiations; Urging the CCP to Send Peace Negotiation Representatives as Soon as Possible; Unity Among Government Parties Becomes Closer

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The primary task of He Yingqin's new cabinet is obviously to continue peace talks with the CCP. According to Shao Lizi, a peace talk representative, who told reporters on the 13th, the departure date of the delegation can be determined by the new cabinet after consulting with the Communist Party on the date of the start of the peace talks. At the same time, it also urges the Communist Party to send representatives as soon as possible. In addition, regarding the peace talk representatives appointed by the government, some have repeatedly requested to resign, but the government has not yet appointed new candidates as of now.

[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 13th] Most independent and qualified observers here believe that the result of He Yingqin's nomination as the new Prime Minister may hardly improve the prospects for peace between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Due to He Yingqin's past relationship with former President Chiang, they believe that He's future task is actually to prevent Acting President Li from making major concessions to the Communist Party and to hold peace negotiations based on Mao Zedong's eight conditions. The general opinion here does not doubt Acting President Li's sincerity in seeking peace to end the civil war, but is deeply afraid that his declaration in Nanjing on the 11th, which was extremely confident about peace, is in fact groundless. He Yingqin's power is based on the generals and provincial governors, but this force is insufficient to re-establish a common front when the expected peace negotiations are held with the Communist Party. Most people also expressed doubts about He's military talent and whether he can inspire morale if the government decides to reject the CCP's demands.

### The CCP Attempts to Divide the Government: To Achieve the Goal of Individual Breakthroughs

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] According to reliable sources, it was revealed to reporters on the 13th that the CCP is currently trying to divide the government in order to achieve the goal of individual breakthroughs. It is said that the CCP is currently targeting Acting President Li as the object of peace talks, and has expressed its willingness to agree to Li and Bai Chongxi participating in the joint government structure after future "comprehensive peace." However, it firmly insists on adopting a mixed formation for the garrison issue in the Nanjing-Shanghai area under "comprehensive peace." The person also stated to reporters that the CCP intends to adopt a divisive policy to unite with Acting President Li in order to attack President Chiang. However, Acting President Li was not moved by this intention after learning about it. Judging from the recent political developments, the close unity between Chiang and Li makes it difficult for the CCP to achieve its goal of division.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] More than a month has passed since Acting President Li took office. During this period, it has been repeatedly rumored that there seemed to be some misunderstandings or misinterpretations between Chiang and Li. On the 13th, a highly authoritative person in the government told reporters that Zhang Zhizhong's trip to Fenghua this time has made the party and the government's internal unity closer between President Chiang and Acting President Li. The person expressed great satisfaction with this.

### Wang Chonghui Inspects in Guangzhou: The Recent Situation of Various Judicial Organs

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 13th] President of the Judicial Yuan Wang Chonghui inspected the recent situation of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, Guangdong High Court, Guangzhou District Court, and Procuratorate in Guangzhou on the 13th, and convened a meeting of subordinates to give instructions.

### President Chiang Will Go to Gulangyu: Closely Watching the Reform of the Kuomintang

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] According to reliable sources, the retired President Chiang has decided to leave Xikou and move to Gulangyu to stay for a while in the next few days. However, it is not yet known whether he will return to Xikou after going to Gulangyu.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 13th] Zhang Zhizhong told a newspaper reporter on the 13th that President Chiang told him that he would withdraw from politics within five years and give Acting President Li full authority to govern. Zhang continued to say that Chiang "apologetically" talked about his past political failures, so he has no intention of getting involved in politics again. However, Zhang Zhizhong also said that Chiang is a revolutionary and will continue to lead the Kuomintang to devote himself to revolutionary work. He said that President Chiang is closely watching the reform of the Kuomintang, strengthening the party's organization and restoring the party's revolutionary spirit. Zhang also said that President Chiang has gained eight pounds since his retirement, from 118 pounds to 126 pounds. He added that President Chiang is in good spirits and goes hiking every day.

### The Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River Continue to Be Blockaded: Whether to Open It Will Be Considered at the End of Next Month Depending on the Situation; The Gold Yuan Certificate in the Communist Areas of Northern Jiangsu Has Been Completely Collected

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 13th] According to semi-official information, Tang Enbo stated at the Pacification Conference held in Changzhou a few days ago that this blockade will continue until the end of April, and then it will be considered whether to open or continue the blockade depending on the actual needs at that time.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 13th] After the Yangtze River was blockaded, Zhenjiang was extremely short of materials, and the source of daily necessities such as firewood, grass, and rice has been cut off, which has greatly affected people's lives. The Zhenjiang County Government specially invited people from all walks of life to hold a symposium on the 13th. County Magistrate Xie has summarized the opinions of all parties and submitted them to the Provincial Government for concrete solutions. In addition, 2,000 to 3,000 unemployed workers at the Jiangbian Wharf are being helped by the General Labor Union to change careers.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 13th] According to people from Yangzhou, after northern Jiangsu was occupied by the Communist army, the Gold Yuan Certificate was completely collected by the end of the first lunar month. The anti-currency currently in circulation is of very poor printing quality. The ratio between it and the Gold Yuan Certificate is 6,000 Gold Yuan Certificates to 10,000 anti-currency. The price of rice in Yangzhou and Liangtai is 430,000 anti-currency per picul, and soybean oil is 45,000 per catty. The car fare from Yangzhou to Xiannv Temple is 100,000, and store transactions are sluggish.

### The Supervisory Yuan Holds a Preparatory Meeting: The Agenda for Today and Tomorrow Has Been Decided; The Annual Session Will Last for Two Weeks in Principle

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The first general meeting of the Supervisory Yuan's 38th Annual Session is scheduled to be held on the morning of the 14th. The focus of discussion at the annual session has been decided to be on reviewing national affairs and supervisory work. On the morning of the 13th, the Yuan held a preparatory meeting for the 38th Annual Session. More than 80 members attended the meeting, which was chaired by Liu Pingjiang. After discussion, it was decided that: (1) The annual session will last for two weeks in principle, and may be extended to four weeks if necessary. (2) The procedures of the general meeting will be work reports, business reviews, political reviews, and proposal discussions. (3) A procedural committee will be established to determine the procedures and content of proposal discussions, and Tang Honglie, Sun Yulin, Chen Darong, Li Sichong, Jin Yueguang, Wang Xiangchen, Liu Pingjiang, Ren Bingjun, Gu Fengxiang, Mao Yiheng, He Jizhou, Xiong Zaiwei, Li Mengbiao, Feng Yunxian, Cui Zhenhua, and Wang Zhenhua were elected on the spot. Ni Bi and seventeen others were elected as members. The procedural committee held its first meeting immediately after the preparatory meeting, and decided that the general meeting on the 14th would listen to reports from the Secretariat and the committees, review the reports of the first day on the morning of the 15th, and listen to reports from various administrative offices in the afternoon.

### The Communist Army Has 300,000 Troops in Northern Jiangsu and Central Anhui: It Is Rumored That Lin Biao's Troops Have Passed Through Xuzhou and Gone South

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Chen Yi's East China Field Army has apparently placed its main force in the area north of the Yangtze River in northern Jiangsu and central Anhui as of today. Although the Communist Party has also advocated seeking peace for the past two months, it has actually been working hard to reorganize and gradually move south in the areas south of the Yellow River that it occupies. In addition to the ten-odd columns of the Central Plains Field Army commanded by Liu Bocheng, Chen Yi's First to Twelfth Columns, plus the three new Fourth, Seventh, and Eighth Columns formed by upgrading militia, plus the four columns of Rapid, Liangguang, Bohai, and Yangtze, totaling 19 columns, numbering about 300,000 people, have gathered in the areas of Jingjiang, Yangzhou, Liangtai, and Wuwei and Hexian. It was once rumored in Nanjing on the 12th that there were Communist troops drinking water on the Jiangxin Island in Tangjiagou, Wuwei, and that the sentries on the south bank of the Yangtze River shot at them. The military here is also summarizing and determining the detailed locations of each column. If the Communist army believes that "negotiators can negotiate, and those preparing for war can go to war," then the Communist army's work of approaching the north bank of the Yangtze River for the past two months can be said to have been completed. The second step is to destroy the bridgehead garrison on the north bank of the Yangtze River from Huaining in the west to the port in the east. As of tonight, there have been no changes in the situation of the bridgeheads on the north bank of the Yangtze River, and everything is very peaceful. However, the isolated Jiangbei strongholds, which are 600 kilometers long and have their backs to the water, have extremely arduous tasks for the officers and soldiers, and their mood is particularly heavy. Although it is rumored in Nanjing that Lin Biao's troops have already passed through Xuzhou and gone south, and that Chen Yi's troops will prepare to cross the Yangtze River in full force after March 20, all of these depend on the development of the battle for the bridgeheads on the entire northern Jiangxi line in the next two weeks.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 13th] According to unconfirmed reports on the 13th, three to five columns of Lin Biao's troops arrived in Xuzhou. It has been repeatedly rumored in the past week that Lin Biao's troops have gone south, but Deng Wenyi, a military spokesman for the government, told reporters on the 10th that he had not received any information that could confirm or deny this rumor. If the above rumors are true, it will be a greater military pressure on the National Government, which may affect future peace talks.

### The Communist Army in Southern Henan Attacks Luoshan: Fierce Battle Through the Night; Finally Defeated; The National Army Enters Macheng

[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 13th] Military News: The 62nd Regiment and a part of the cavalry of the Communist army, which launched another counterattack on Luoshan County (90 li from Xinyang) on the night of the 11th, were blocked by the elite troops of the National Army Li Benbu and the Second Security Brigade on the line of Bali Temple, Bali Shop, and Yaodian northeast of Luoshan. After a fierce battle day and night, all of the Communist army was defeated by the National Army by midnight on the 12th. Bali Temple Village has been razed to the ground in the battle between the two sides. Many refugees there fled to the county seat, and their situation is very miserable.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 13th] It is reported that after the Communist army in southeastern Henan frequently moved south, the authorities are strengthening the defense of eastern Hubei. The local Communist army near Macheng has been cleared, and the elite troops of the National Army have entered Macheng on the 12th.

### The Communist Army's East China Field Army Is Undergoing Large-Scale Training

All units are now enthusiastically studying various policies of the People's Liberation Army." Recently, various parties have widely rumored that the Communist army is preparing for war in eastern Henan and on the north bank of the Yangtze River, and the military is particularly active in advocating war.

### Qingdao and the Communist Areas Have Postal Communications: Lancun Is the Exchange Location

### Editorial: It is Better to Take a Realistic Approach

—Regarding Our Hopes for President He—

General He Yingqin has been nominated as the third Premier of the Executive Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution and was successfully approved by a majority of 209 votes in the Legislative Yuan on the 12th. People from both the government and the public believe that at this time and place, the person who can assist Acting President Li and support the precarious situation, and who is qualified to be the premier, is none other than General He. As the ancients said, "If this person does not come forth, what will happen to the people?" The popular support that General He enjoys today is no less than that of the sages of the past.

Although General He has not yet taken up his new post as Premier of the Executive Yuan, during his stay at West Lake to celebrate his birthday, he was urged by Acting President Li and persuaded by friends from all sides, and he should accept the appointment. After arriving in Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday afternoon, he attended a symposium of Central Committee members of the Kuomintang who remained in Shanghai to exchange views and will visit prominent figures to listen to public opinion. At the same time, he will seek the participation of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party in the new cabinet. This alone shows that General He is modest and knows that his appointment at this time is arduous, and he must give serious consideration to policy decisions and the selection of cabinet members.

On the eve of General He's formation of the new cabinet, President Chiang personally wrote the eight characters "Our safety depends on you, let us share the hardships" as a birthday greeting for his sixtieth birthday. Everyone knows that in the past, the founding father Sun Yat-sen had written for President Chiang the couplet "Our safety in the future will depend on you, let us share the hardships when they come." Today, General He receives these eight characters from the retiring President Chiang, which shows that Mr. Chiang has high hopes for General He, almost like Mr. Sun's expectations of Mr. Chiang in those years. General He's acceptance of the mandate from Acting President Li further indicates that his life is tied to the safety of the nation and that he will share its joys and sorrows, without having to wait for the future.

Premier He issued a written statement yesterday, saying that he will strive for political improvement and the realization of peace with the spirit of unity and innovation. Although the words are simple, the meaning is profound. However, the earnest expectations of all parties for Premier He cannot be satisfied by these few words. When it comes to military affairs, everyone hopes that he will reorganize the army; when it comes to politics, everyone hopes that he will reduce the size of government agencies; when it comes to economics, everyone especially hopes that he will implement social policies based on the Principle of People's Livelihood. As for how to seek reasonable and equal peace, it is naturally the main question that everyone wants him to answer. However, in our humble opinion, we have a slightly different view. We believe that although Premier He is a military man, he is gentle and refined, very approachable, not one to aim too high, and does not seem to be an impulsive or extreme character. Because of this, we would like to advise Premier He that instead of setting too high an ideal before taking office, it is better to adopt a realistic approach, assess the current environment and one's own strength, and first propose a few things that can be fulfilled and done, and then work hard to achieve them.

Some people may think that today's China is terminally ill and must be determined to take strong medicine to save it, as the saying goes, "If the medicine does not cause dizziness, the disease will not be cured." However, we believe that although China's illness today is extremely serious, the body is also extremely weak. How to eliminate the disease is important, but how to support the vital energy so that it does not weaken is even more urgent. If we only cater to the fashion, seek momentary pleasure, prescribe prescriptions indiscriminately, and take them blindly, we are afraid that the disease may not be cured, but life may be lost first. For example, what Wang Yunwu did as the Minister of Finance during the Weng Cabinet era is still causing great harm to the country today. It can be seen that the merit or demerit of a politician should not only be judged by his motives but also by the effect of his measures. We do not want to see Premier He issue many colorful checks when he reports his administrative policies to the Legislative Yuan but be unable to cash them in the future. We only hope that he will very cautiously issue one or two political checks and be able to cash them in full when they are due, sweeping away the bad habit of political figures in the past who spoke boastfully when they took office but shirked their responsibilities when they arrived.

What we call realism does not mean that we do not want ideals, but that ideals should not be too far from reality. It is rumored that Premier He intends to follow the social policies of the British Labour Party, which is naturally excellent. But yesterday, Premier He said that he had not done much research on this. This may disappoint some people, but we can see Premier He's sincerity through this. We have heard British friends say to Premier He that China's laws are almost all-encompassing, and some regulations may even be better than those in Britain, but the problem is that they cannot be implemented. It can be seen that today's China does not need to talk about emulating Britain, imitating the United States, or learning from the Soviet Union. What Chinese politicians should be earnestly striving for at present is to make gradual reforms to seek progress, focusing on the reality of China's political, economic, and military situation. This is the true meaning of what we call "it is better to take a realistic approach."

To be honest, China today does not lack experts who design in the air, nor does it lack those who engage in high-sounding talk, especially those politicians who are opportunistic, speculative, fickle, and who manipulate the situation. As for those who are loyal, upright, unselfish, and eager to do their duty, the hardworking and practical fools, although not as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, are not easy to find today. Premier He is a veteran who has long held military power and cannot be compared to those who engage in empty talk. He was also sent to the United States and must have been influenced by the earnest and responsible demeanor of politicians in democratic countries. We hope that he will come out of retirement this time, identify his goals, work hard, be practical, and be determined to be a big fool who does not ask for harvest but only for cultivation. We advise Premier He not to compete with scholars in rhetoric but to use his loyalty and perseverance to face reality and show the people the results of his checks being cashed.

### Arrests in Beiping Continue Uninterrupted: Kuomintang Members and Others are All Targets

Remarks by a legislator after fleeing to the capital

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 13th dispatch] A certain legislator who had just fled from Beiping has arrived in Nanjing. According to his statement to reporters, the arrest work by the CCP authorities in Beiping is actually still in progress, but only the arrests of Xu Huidong and Zhang Yinwu have been announced. According to what he knew, Tan Zheng, the Public Security Bureau Chief sent by the CCP, had ordered all the police officers of the former police bureau to be retained, but ordered those who were retained to arrest one to five people each within three months to show their loyalty to the new regime. The targets of the arrests included seven types of people: Kuomintang members, Youth Party members, Democratic Socialist Party members, military intelligence personnel, military police, and scattered soldiers. Therefore, the arrest work has never been interrupted. Each police district has a "re-education center," where those arrested are first sent for detention, and then their whereabouts are unknown. When he fled from Beiping in mid-February, he was almost arrested. Regarding the arrest of Zhang Yinwu, according to what he knew, it was because Zhang's Si Cun Middle School had implemented military training during the War of Resistance and participated in guerrilla warfare. Therefore, it had more than 200 rifles. After the Communist army entered the city, Zhang was afraid of trouble, so he handed them all over. Unexpectedly, the Communist side said that Zhang had more than a thousand rifles and forced him to hand over another 800. Zhang could not comply, so he was arrested. In fact, the reason for Zhang's arrest was an "old grudge," because during the War of Resistance, the Communist side said that Zhang was a "friction expert." As for the foreign電 report that more than 10,000 military police in Beiping were missing, and the Communist side published a notice to find them, the truth is that all the officers and soldiers of the 19th Regiment of Military Police stationed in Beiping were incorporated into the 13th Army and 16th Army by Fu Zuoyi during the "peaceful" surrender. Only a small number who were unwilling to compromise either hid or fled. Therefore, the seven types of people arrested by the Communist side also included military police. The Beiping garrison was nominally reorganized by the Communist army and transferred, but in fact, the unity of the various units was extremely strong, and the Communist personnel had not been able to infiltrate them. The officers in command of each unit were still the old ones. The Communist side provided millet as rations, but they mostly hailed from the South and found it difficult to swallow, so they refused. The Communist side had no choice but to provide rice, because their strength was strong, and the Communist side was afraid of causing other changes, so they were very afraid of them.

### Hidden Worries in Western Hunan: Uprisings Break Out Frequently; Chen Mingren's Troops Stationed in Wugang and Dongkou to Suppress Them

[This newspaper, Changsha, 13th dispatch] Turmoil in Hunan is widespread, with crises lurking everywhere. Although the situation in Yuanling has temporarily calmed down, many others are following suit. In the triangle area of Huaihua, Yuping, and Wugang, "heroes" are rising in large numbers. It has been reported here that Yin Liyan (graduate of the Army University) in Jiangkou, Wugang, calls himself the "Commander of the Southwest Column" and has more than 1,000 men. Xiang Chengzhu in Longtan, Xupu, calls himself the "Division Commander of the 14th Column of the Ministry of National Defense" and is recruiting troops. Zhang Yulin, who has fallen into Chenxi, is still in the area between Xupu and Chenxi, claiming to have four divisions, and is bargaining with the government. The bandit leader Li Dongsheng is leading his men to harass Huaihua, and the Fuhai County Government has moved to Yushawan. Liu Kai, the chief of the battalion in Dongkou, Wugang, led a police mutiny on the evening of the 9th. The most worrying hidden danger is Wu Hengliang, the current deputy commander of the 8th District Security, who is now in Yongshui. There have been rumors of instability. Wu is a Miao leader with more than 10,000 men, and if he takes any action, it will be alarming. There is much criticism of the authorities' policy of suppression and appeasement. Chen Kun, a provincial senator, said: "Appeasing the gentry bandits and suppressing the people" has become a famous saying quoted by newspapers.

[This newspaper, Changsha, 13th dispatch] The troops of the First Army Group under Chen Mingren have stationed themselves in Wugang and Dongkou, which is expected to alleviate the turmoil in that area.

[This newspaper, Changsha, 13th dispatch] Although the rebel people in Yuanling have withdrawn, the National Army has not yet stationed a large number of troops in the city at the request of the people, for fear that they will make a comeback. Zhang Yulin, the rebel leader in Chenxi, calls himself the commander of the First Army of the National Defense Force. It has been reported that he has established four divisions. This time, the troops robbed 40,000 rifles, 400 heavy machine guns, 200 light machine guns, 400 mortars, and tons of ammunition from the arsenal. Therefore, their momentum is huge, and there is talk of attacking the Anjiang Yarn Factory. Chen Jieshi went to Chenxi to recruit and appease them, but there has been no progress. Fortunately, the burning and looting in Chenxi is not as serious as in Yuanling, because Commander Ma Shuming is from Chenxi and is the younger brother of Ma Gongran, a prominent figure in western Hunan. Zhang and others still respect the opinions of the Ma brothers.

### United States and Denmark Begin Talks on Greenland Base Issue; Iceland Decides to Join the Atlantic Treaty

[United Press, Washington, 12th dispatch] The future status of the strategic base in Greenland in establishing a strong Atlantic defense network to resist armed aggression was clearly outlined on the 12th in the talks between the United States and Denmark on this Atlantic Treaty. The base issue in the ice area has been discussed by Danish Foreign Minister Rasmusson and senior officials of the State Department. According to the 1941 treaty between the United States and Denmark, the United States may still maintain several defense bases in Greenland. The eight countries that have completed the treaty negotiations are eager for Denmark and its strategic Atlantic colonies to join their defense organization. Denmark's participation in this treaty is now truly certain, but diplomatic circles believe that Italy will join this historic peacetime alliance before Denmark.

[Reuters, Washington, 12th dispatch] Danish Foreign Minister Rasmusson will leave Washington on Tuesday and plans to meet with Acheson again before leaving.

[Associated Press, Reykjavik, Iceland, 13th dispatch] The Icelandic government announced today that it had been invited to participate in negotiations on the North Atlantic Treaty.

### Italian Youth Demonstration Against Italy Joining the Covenant; Parliament Adjourns to This Afternoon

[United Press International, Rome, 12th] Gasperi's convocation of a Monday meeting did not materialize. Parliamentarians overturned his order to convene a special Christian Democratic Party meeting and adjourned the session until 4:00 PM on the 14th.

[Reuters, Rome, 12th] Thousands of Italian youths gathered in a square near the House of Representatives today, during the House debate on the Atlantic Pact, to stage a demonstration against the Atlantic Pact. A large number of police officers, wearing steel helmets and carrying Thompson submachine guns and batons, rushed to the scene in jeeps upon receiving the alert, attempting to disperse the crowd. Chaos ensued, and fighting broke out, resulting in numerous arrests. The demonstrating youths loudly denounced the police as fascists, and nearby shops quickly closed to avoid being affected. Earlier, senators and representatives of the right-wing Italian Democratic Socialist Party, under the leadership of Saragat, decided to support the government's resolution to join the Atlantic Pact. The leader of the left-wing Socialist Party, Nenni, strongly criticized the Atlantic Pact at the beginning of the House debate, claiming that it was an attempt to encircle the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries.

### US Actively Researching How to Cope with Germ Warfare

[Reuters, Washington, 12th] Secretary of Defense Forrestal recently revealed that although the United States is not yet aware of the existence of germ weapons in other countries, for the sake of thorough preparation, various defense agencies have been preparing methods to deal with possible germ warfare tactics, and active research programs are currently underway. However, the rumor that a single small germ bomb could destroy an entire city is, at this stage, an exaggeration. The first line of defense against germ warfare is to maintain a high level of public health and take measures to protect animals and crops. Germ attacks do not cause immediate destruction of life, so they can be dealt with through appropriate medical measures. The important defense methods against germ warfare are to diagnose the types of diseases and quickly prevent their spread. Of course, these defense measures should be completed before an attack. Furthermore, we should not only deal with germ warfare attacks during wartime, but also prevent germ-related sabotage activities during peacetime.

### Five Western European Nations to Meet Today to Discuss Military and Economic Coordination Plans; Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg Agree to Conclude a Three-Nation Economic Alliance

[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th] According to reliable British sources: The Consultative Committee of the five signatory countries of the Brussels Treaty is scheduled to meet in London tomorrow to discuss the draft Atlantic Pact and will complete a true "Military Marshall Plan." The finance ministers and defense ministers of the five countries will also attend the meeting to discuss the economic and financial terms of this new plan, especially the issue of funding for the manufacture of military equipment.

According to well-informed sources: The Atlantic Pact will stipulate direct military assistance from the United States, i.e., shipping military equipment, etc., and mutual assistance among the signatory countries. This assistance will be based on the amount each country receives or provides under the Marshall Plan, and will be determined by its balance of payments and the extent of its contribution to enhancing common security. The first matter to be resolved is how the military assistance provided by the United States and Canada will be distributed to the European signatory countries. It is now believed that the amount will depend on the economic situation of each country. As the US military aid will be limited, the European countries will still be asked to make special efforts themselves, without endangering the progress of their economic recovery. It is said that the economic burden of equipping the armies of those European signatory countries whose economic recovery has not made sufficient progress, but which must still maintain large armies to fulfill their common defense responsibilities, will be partially borne by the United Kingdom.

[Reuters, The Hague, 12th] It is reported that the meeting of the ministers of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg being held here has agreed to establish a provisional economic alliance of the three countries on July 1 this year, and to continue to establish a formal economic alliance on July 1, 1950. All trade and payment agreements concluded between the three countries will be reviewed in the provisional economic alliance. It is said that the Netherlands has agreed to gradually reduce restrictions on the domestic market, while Belgium will make concessions in terms of lending.

### Comintern Decides on Action Plan to Deliberately Overthrow the Tito Regime and Support Macedonian Independence

[Reuters, London, 13th] Diplomatic sources here point out that the conflict over the Macedonian issue within the Soviet sphere of influence seems to have intensified this week. Although this conflict is only of a local nature, it may have far-reaching consequences. The recent announcement by the Communist "Free Greece" radio station that a Macedonian independent state, united by various Macedonian ethnic groups, will soon be established within the Balkan National Federation has aroused Yugoslavia's resentment.

It is believed here that Moscow has approved a long-term propaganda and political war plan with the goal of establishing an independent Macedonian state. This move would cause Yugoslavia to lose the Macedonian region within its southern borders, and would also deprive northern Greece of a large area of land. Moscow's support for this action is due to the belief that the Greek guerrillas are unlikely to achieve much, and that overthrowing the Tito regime is not possible in the short term.

[Reuters, Athens, 12th] Greek Public Security Minister Rendis said that the Greek Communists had revealed to him a conspiracy to unite Bulgarian, Albanian, and Greek guerrillas to overthrow Tito. They believed that the Soviet Union had sacrificed Greek communism for its Macedonian policy, and that the Greek communist leaders had abandoned their beliefs. The war they are currently engaged in is merely fulfilling the goals of imperialists. The action plan is said to involve launching military operations by Greek guerrillas infiltrating southern Serbia and Slavic guerrillas in Greek Macedonia, inciting the Macedonians to rebel against Tito. They believe that the Tito regime will inevitably collapse under this situation, and then Bulgarian-led rebels can march south and seize Salonica, the Aegean Sea port they dream of.

Attending were Councilors Li Wenjie, Shi Zongde, Wang Zhuyi, Jiang Hao, Zhang Zhongyuan, Wang Naixu, He Yuanming, Zhu Fuju, Chu Shun, Ma Junshuo, and more than 20 others. Also present were Zhao Huijue and Zhang Rentao, the Director and Deputy Director of the Public Utilities Bureau. The meeting was chaired by Jiang Haoran to discuss the new price adjustment method and the determination of its base value for public utilities after the cancellation of pricing in coordination with gold yuan.

(2) Users whose meters are read from the 8th to the 23rd of each month will be charged based on the base value multiplied by the cost of living index published on the 15th of each month. Users whose meters are read from the 24th of each month to the 7th of the following month will be charged based on the base value multiplied by the cost of living index published at the end of each month. (3) For users whose meters are read from the 8th to the 15th and from the 24th to the end of the month, when the cost of living index has not yet been published, the Municipal Government may determine the increase or decrease rate based on the price fluctuations at that time, convert it into Gold Yuan, and collect the fees in advance. This increase or decrease rate shall not exceed the fluctuation multiple expressed by the period-to-period index of the previous period. If there is a difference between the published index and this increase or decrease rate, refunds will be made for overpayments and additional payments will be collected for underpayments. (4) To reduce procedures, for bills already issued by various public utility companies in early March, those that have already listed the Gold Yuan amount shall be charged according to the Gold Yuan amount listed on the bill. Those that list the units and the conversion rate shall be charged according to the units multiplied by the conversion rate. Those that only list the units shall be charged by multiplying all units by the conversion rate of 1062.5 published on the 9th of this month, and no additional charges shall be added. (5) The public transportation sector shall be handled in accordance with the foregoing methods, but after the promulgation of these measures, adjustments shall not exceed twice per month.

The city's gold and silver market is about to be established within this week. According to financial authorities, after the market is established, the Central Bank will use its enormous power to strengthen control over the market.

The Statistical Office of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is still studying it technically. In addition, the Municipal Industrial Association and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions are also coordinating to compile the index, so the published figures should be more accurate.

### US Oil Company Donates Food to Help Our Displaced Students

[Reported by this newspaper] The American Texaco Oil Company recently donated 556 bags of rice and 561 bags of flour to the United China Relief Association for emergency distribution to displaced students in various places. There are 7,000 of these displaced students in Wuxi, 600 in Suzhou, and 900 in Jiaxing. In addition, 12 children's welfare agencies will also receive aid and will distribute it to 1,600 children.

### Registration for Gold Businesses to Resume; 40 Applicants; Scope of Business Awaiting Further Regulations

[Reported by this newspaper] The city's Gold Business Association began handling the resumption registration of member companies yesterday. The initial procedure is to obtain and fill out a resumption registration application form from the association. Although yesterday was a regular holiday, the association still worked as usual because the Ministry of Finance instructed that resumption be realized quickly within a short period of time. It is reported that about 40 member companies took out application forms from the association yesterday, but none have yet submitted completed application forms.

It was also reported yesterday that the association will adopt a brokerage system after the resumption of business, and will expand the scope of brokers to include brokerage firms, trust departments, and jewelry stores. According to a spokesman for the association, the Ministry of Finance's order to resume business for the association is limited to members of the association, and the members of the association are originally limited to companies engaged in the sale of refined gold, and do not involve the sale of fine silver or silver dollars. In the future, after the industry resumes business, whether its business scope needs to be expanded, or whether those engaged in the sale of refined gold will also expand to other industries, still depends on further regulations by the financial authorities in the entire plan for the open gold and silver market.

### Daring Landing in Jinan; Loss of Freedom for More Than a Month; Eight Chinese and Foreign Passengers Released and Arrive in Qingdao; Detailed Account of the Hijacking of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Plane

[Reported from Qingdao on the 13th by this newspaper] The list of passengers released from the hijacked CNAC plane from Jinan to Qingdao is as follows: Chen Jingwen (Director of the Naval Shipyard), Zhou Jiajun (Assistant Manager of Qing Central Bank), Zhou Zhang Fubi (Zhou's newlywed wife), Liu Zuolu, Mou Huanhai, Song Shu (all Qingdao merchants), Josef.Kanflord (German priest), W.Haealoop (German merchant), a total of eight people. According to the eight passengers who returned to Qingdao, the remaining six adults and one child were confirmed to be special passengers sent by the Communists. The list is as follows: Li Yun, Chen Tiesheng, Liu Shurong, Hua Xinghang, Xing Guozheng, Liu Jiying, and Liu Didi (about two years old), possibly aliases. According to the passengers who returned to Qingdao, the eight of them and the three crew members were taken to the Jinan Municipal Government on the day the plane was hijacked to Jinan (30th). After inquiring about their names and resumes, they were sent to the Shitaigan Hotel (Municipal Government Guesthouse), where they were divided into six rooms, occupying one floor, and lost their freedom. They spent their days playing bridge, playing Go, or throwing iron balls in the yard to pass the time. The Communists sent people to the Shitaigan Hotel to inquire again on the 31st, and reiterated that they could be safely sent back to Qingdao. On the 9th, Chen Jingwen and Zhou Jiajun and his wife were taken to the Communist Party's Garrison Headquarters for questioning. They firmly believed that they were prisoners of war. Chen and others explained the true meaning of (prisoners of war). The Communist interrogator (whose name is unknown) said, "You were forced to Jinan with guns, so what are you if not prisoners of war"? However, Chen and others' repeated explanations seemed to be effective. They returned to the Shitaigan Hotel after being detained in the Communist Rehabilitation Brigade for five days.

Special Passengers Apparently Related to the Communists

Another noteworthy thing is that when the plane made a forced landing at Jinan Airport, the Communist personnel seemed to be very familiar with the special passengers, addressing them affectionately as "Lao Yu, Lao Yu" (Lao Yu is a transliteration). And said, "You're back," as if to congratulate them. The next day, the special passengers visited them at the Shitaigan Hotel and expressed their apologies for being forced to do so. All of this proves that the hijacking of Flight 135 was a planned action by special passengers sent by the Communists, and "Lao Yu" seemed to be the leader. According to the passengers who returned to Qingdao, the seats on the plane were open at the time. The seating arrangement from the cockpit to the plane door was: special passenger, special passenger (woman holding a child), Chen Jingwen, German priest, German merchant. On the opposite row from the cockpit were: special passenger, special passenger, Mrs. Zhou, Zhou Jiajun, three Qingdao merchants, followed by two special passengers. According to a Qingdao merchant, two hand grenades were found under his seat. When this group of special passengers boarded the plane, they carried a package that was placed next to the rear seat of the plane. Twenty minutes after takeoff, the special passenger next to Mrs. Zhou, who was described as thin and tall, took off his Chinese robe and revealed a green woolen air force uniform and a handgun. The other special passengers also launched their attack, producing handguns. There were a total of three guns: one Browning and two revolvers. The female special passenger was the most calm and took on the responsibility of surveillance, and it is believed that she also had a handgun hidden behind her clothes. "Lao Yu" pointed a gun at the passengers and said that everyone was running around outside and was not allowed to move, or they would be shot dead.

Forced the Co-pilot to Fly to Jinan Airport

At that time, the cockpit door was open to distribute refreshments. Co-pilot Shu Zhilun and the radio operator were threatened by the special passengers with guns and ordered not to move and to raise their hands. They said not to joke, and the special passengers replied that who was joking with you. One of the special passengers opened the package that had been placed at the tail of the plane, took out a flight suit and changed into it, and quickly entered the cockpit, seizing the pilot's seat, and then headed for Jinan. There were no special events in the time that followed, but "Lao Yu" was the busiest coming and going. When the plane arrived over Jinan, it was shot at by machine guns. However, after circling for more than twenty minutes and discovering the intention to land, the ground personnel waved white towels to indicate the wind direction. The special passengers ordered the co-pilot to fly the plane to land. Shu replied that he was not confident and would have to ask the captain. But they did not agree and insisted on Shu getting in to fly the plane. The first attempt was unsuccessful, and although the second attempt was successful, the shaking was quite severe, but fortunately it was safe.

Flight 135 May Still be in Jinan

The passengers who returned to Qingdao also said: They saw many damaged aircraft parts at the Jinan airport, all covered with firewood. Flight 135 may still be there, and it is not easy to detect from aerial reconnaissance. The special intelligence obtained in Qingdao may not be reliable. The Communist personnel told them: We did not fire fiercely at the CNAC plane that flew low that day because we believed that the plane had come to inquire about your news. The pilots and passengers, in addition to reading newspapers that were consistent with the content of the Communist broadcast, knew almost nothing about the outside world. However, during the Lunar New Year, they constantly heard the sound of Yangko teams and drums coming and going on the streets. During that time, they happened to meet an air force member who made propaganda to them, claiming that it was not propaganda, but was immediately forbidden by the guards. They had repeatedly jointly sent a letter to the Communist Jinan Municipal Government, asking them to fulfill their promise to send them back to Qingdao. At 10:00 on the 5th, the guards announced that they would be leaving and sent a squad of soldiers to accompany them to Lancun, and then handed them over to the Communist guerrillas for extradition. The Communists said that Chen Jingwen and Zhou Jiajun and his wife were treated the same as other passengers after asking their superiors for instructions.

### Bridges Repaired One After Another; Pudong Avenue Fully Open

Since the Municipal Government approved and allocated special funds last year, the Public Works Bureau has completed the construction of Bridges No. 8 and No. 10 on Pudong Avenue one after another. In January of this year, 898,000 Gold Yuan were allocated from the US aid funds, and Bridge No. 9 was rushed to completion within three weeks. Other bridges, No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3, are also being repaired by the authorities at an accelerated pace with allocated funds. It is reported that Pudong Avenue is now fully open. You can take a ferry from the South Wharf of this city to Pudong Avenue and go directly to Gaoqiao Beach. The Pudong Avenue road surface project is also being thoroughly repaired one after another. From now on, Pudong transportation can usher in a new era.

### Travelers Few Amidst War and Chaos: The Railroad Business Deplorable, Looking Back—The Railway Bureau Inspection Team Returns, Discussing Conditions Along the Line

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The inspection team from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau has just returned from inspecting major stations along the Beijing-Shanghai Line. Yesterday, our reporter obtained information and conducted an individual interview to inquire about the recent conditions along the line and the state of this vital artery after undergoing "evacuation" and the "military transport" double affliction.

The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Inspection Team included Qian Hegao, Director of the Railway Bureau's Police Affairs Department; Huang Dexi, Deputy Director; Liu Shizhong, Deputy Director of the Transportation Department; and Commissioner Peng Fenggang. They first arrived in Suzhou. The city of Suzhou has not lost its paradisiacal essence. Merchants and civilians who fled from Nanjing and across the river to seek refuge, as well as the families of provincial government officials who moved from Zhenjiang during the most chaotic period, have created an abnormal prosperity in Suzhou.

Severe Housing Shortage in Suzhou

Recently, the number of stationed troops has been increasing daily. Almost all temples, ancestral halls, and relatively spacious courtyards have been filled with soldiers and their families, leading to an increasingly severe housing shortage. The number of soldiers among the tourists at Tiger Hill and Lion Grove has also increased significantly. Public security in the suburbs has become quite problematic. Accidents have occurred consecutively. No one goes to play at Mudu, Lingyan Mountain, or Tianping Mountain anymore. Even the inspection team's desire to taste the famous dishes of the Shi Family Restaurant in their spare time was not fulfilled.

The next day, they arrived in Wuxi. Among the current Beijing-Shanghai line, Wuxi can be considered second to none. The market is good, public security is good, and industry and commerce are prosperous. It is rare to see troops in the city. Yuantouzhu, Five Mile Lake, Plum Garden, 　Garden, and Huishan Mountain are still captivating. Rice noodles, bean curd sheets, meat gluten noodles, and shrimp and dried scallop tofu pudding are still as delicious and delightful as ever. They are looking forward to the arrival of Shanghai's spring outing ladies.

Changzhou is full of soldiers everywhere. The two major ancient temples, Qingliang Temple and Tianning Temple, are no longer Buddhist sites with morning bells and evening drums. Commerce has also shrunk significantly. Because trade with northern Jiangsu has ceased after the Yangtze River was blockaded, goods are stagnant, and the city appears desolate. Zhenjiang, as the seat of the provincial government, appears orderly and disciplined. Although there was chaos at one point due to the relocation of the provincial government, it has long since recovered. The only regret is that scenic spots such as Jiaoshan, Xiangshan, and Ganlu Temple are all within the Yangtze River defense blockade zone, and tourists cannot enter. Although Jinshan is still open, there are few tourists. Last year, Jinshan Temple suffered a devastating attack, leaving only a field of rubble for people to mourn. The garrison is strong, about one army, the river defense is solid, and public security is secure.

Nanjing Only a Shell Remaining

After this major evacuation, Nanjing has only a shell remaining. The various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan are still operating in Guangzhou. The remaining furniture in the ministries has been sold off piecemeal. The Legislative Yuan has resumed sessions in recent days, and the legislators, because most of their families have left Beijing, have brought a lot of business to the Central Hotel. The Confucius Temple is about 40-50% full. The International Hotel at the new Xiaguan Railway Station has closed. The dining room at the station was once suspended but has now reopened, and business is not bad, with most of the patrons being soldiers. National Revolutionary Army soldiers who broke through during the Xuzhou-Huaihai Campaign continue to cross the river and return every day. The situation in various places is still relatively stable. The people are not as sensitive and fearful of war as they used to be. The only thing that is the same everywhere is that the sound of clinking silver dollars can be heard everywhere.

Two Different Scenes in the Memory of North Station Staff

The railway's own business is, to put it sadly, in previous years at this time, every train would have been crowded with spring outing travelers, but now it is deserted with no news at all. The employees of both railways are worried about the sluggish business. The main income of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway depends on passenger transport, with freight transport accounting for only one-third. Last spring was their golden age, with an average of 220,000 passengers per day on both railways. In recent days, they have done a statistic, and the total number of passengers on the entire railway is only about 50,000 per day. An employee at the North Station said to the reporter: "At this time last year, we were so busy day and night that we couldn't catch our breath. Relatives, friends, groups, individuals, all entrusted us to buy tickets, and people were shoulder to shoulder. The North Station was also crowded with beautiful ladies. Look at it now. It's still as crowded as ever, but the spring outing ladies have been replaced by soldiers and refugees." In his memory, two completely different scenes appeared, with an attitude of "it's unbearable to look back and talk about the past."

### Second Phase Relief Lottery Tickets Sales Almost Exhausted

Third Phase Tickets Being Prepared

The second phase of relief lottery tickets issued by the Central Trust of China entrusted by the Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Relief Committee has been selling very well since sales began on February 26, due to the increased prize amount and shortened lottery period. According to surveys, 70-80% have been sold. Recently, because the lottery period is approaching, sales in various distribution stores and banks are even stronger and are about to be exhausted. According to the person in charge of the relief committee, the third phase of tickets is also being prepared and is expected to be sold around the time the second phase of lottery tickets is drawn.

### National School Self-Funded Students Demand Full Public Funding

Decided to Send Representatives to Petition in Beijing

[Report from this Newspaper] Recently, due to soaring prices and the inability to pay for meals, self-funded students in various national colleges and universities in the city have been demanding full public funding. The United Association of Self-Funded and Partially Self-Funded Students of National Colleges and Universities in Shanghai has been organized by Tongji, Jiaotong, Fudan, Jinan, Music Conservatory, Shanghai Business School, and Tangshan Institute of Technology. According to statistics, there are about 2,800 self-funded students in national colleges and universities in the city. After discussion, the association has decided to send representatives to petition President Li in Beijing within a few days, requesting that the quota of public-funded places in various schools in North China be allocated to self-funded students in various schools in this city.

According to the association, the current cost of meals for self-funded students in various schools in the city, taking Jiaotong University as an example, totaled more than 900 yuan in February, but this month it has reached 7,460 yuan. Some self-funded students have had their support cut off due to the impact of the war in their hometowns, some have parents who are civil servants with low incomes, making it difficult to maintain the family's livelihood, and some have hometowns with low prices, and after selling grain and remitting it to Shanghai, they have suffered huge devaluation losses, so their lives are extremely difficult. In the past, they relied on working as home tutors, shining shoes, selling newspapers, selling old clothes, and holding "living auctions," trying their best to support themselves, but now, due to the crazy rise in prices, they believe that they have reached the end of their rope and can no longer endure it. In order to survive, they firmly demand full public funding and the issuance of public funding based on the consumer price index.

### Jiaotong University Faculty Meeting Insists on Salary Based on Index Some Suggest a Few Days of Strike

[Report from this Newspaper] The Faculty Association of National Jiaotong University held a general meeting at the school yesterday morning. Regarding the issue of compensation, it was resolved to insist that the original salary not be discounted and be calculated according to the local cost of living index. It was also suggested that the Association of National College and University Professors in the city send representatives to join the representatives of self-funded students who are fighting for public funding to petition in Beijing, demanding improved compensation. Some also suggested a general strike for a few days to draw the government's attention.

The Association of National College and University Professors in the city is scheduled to hold a regular meeting this afternoon to express its attitude on the matter of demanding improved compensation.

### A Dismissed Policeman Commits Another Crime After Being Released from Prison Conspires with Wife to Rob A Roadway—Evidence and Criminals Caught

[Report from this Newspaper] Zhou Zhengxiang, a native of Ningbo, 36 years old, a Western chef, resides at No. 77 Cunshan Lane, Wujiaochang, Caoxi Road. At about 10:15 p.m. the night before last, while passing the Paramount Ballroom on Yuyuan Road, he caught sight of a young woman, fashionably dressed, also walking west along Yuyuan Road. Zhou followed behind her, and after walking a few steps, the woman took out a lighter from her bag to light a cigarette. Zhou saw an opportunity and used the excuse of borrowing a light to strike up a conversation with the woman, walking and talking, appearing quite intimate. When they reached the west end of Yuguang Village and turned back, a thief suddenly appeared, pulled out a pistol to threaten them, and robbed a Simm wristwatch and 1,200 gold yuan before fleeing with the loot. The woman, who was standing by, had said to Zhou, "Be sensible and let it go," which aroused Zhou's suspicion. He ran to the No. 17 police kiosk near Yuguang Village, and policeman Liu Zhenguo came out with a gun and chased down the woman, bringing her and Zhou to the Jing'an Temple Police Branch. After being questioned by Section Chief Yu himself, the woman confessed that her name was Huang Suping, 31 years old, from Anhui, residing at No. 6 Zhenkang Lane, Xinzha Road, and that her husband's name was Liu Zhenya. Upon hearing this, Section Chief Yu suddenly recalled that Liu had graduated from the police academy and was assigned as a policeman to the criminal investigation team of the Jing'an Temple Branch. He was later transferred to the Changshu Branch, but was dismissed for improper conduct. He had also committed fraud in the Jing'an Temple jurisdiction and had been detained and sentenced to four months in prison by the court. Section Chief Yu immediately ordered the police to rush to Liu's home on Xinzha Road and arrest him. Zhou identified him without error, and Liu confessed after being interrogated. According to the confession, he had only been released from prison for a week and had conspired with his wife to commit robbery due to financial difficulties. Later, the robbed Simm watch and cash were found on his person. He claimed that the pistol had been discarded on the roof of the vegetable market on Heping Road when he was being chased. Police were sent to the scene and indeed found a fake pistol, which was submitted as evidence for further investigation.

### McKinley Delivers a Fierce Performance Shanghai Police Suffer an Unprecedented Defeat Green Team Easily Defeats John

[Report from this Newspaper] The Shanghai Police basketball team suffered its first unprecedented defeat last night, losing 52-28 to McKinley. McKinley led 18-15 at halftime. In the initial battle, the Shanghai Police were still able to keep up. After twenty minutes, they barely lost by three points. In the second half, McKinley shone brightly, scoring eleven consecutive points, and the Shanghai Police defense collapsed completely. McKinley had lost every game in the first cycle, but improved each time, finally avenging the humiliation of the Shanghai Police in the first cycle. McKinley was tall. Last night, the proficiency of their coordination, the speed of their movements, and the accuracy of their shooting were praised by more than a thousand spectators. The Shanghai Police were helpless. They used the same tactics to counter, quick, fast, rush, and high ball back and forth, so they fell into their trap and couldn't get out. With McKinley's ferocity last night, other teams will have some difficulty dealing with them. Guard Liss is tall and shoots accurately; forward Laimshan is a one-two punch, omnipresent. In the second half, the Shanghai Police changed their lineup, but there was no cure, and the score became more and more out of sync. This game, rather than saying that the Shanghai Police were in a slump, it is better to say that McKinley was particularly brilliant.

In the women's game last night, the Green Team defeated John again, 62-15. The Green Team led 30-2 at halftime. In the second B group, Huili B defeated Post and Telecommunications, 52-38. The score at halftime was 29-11.

The Shanghai Police's lineup against McKinley last night was Shi Jiuquan, He Zeng, Wang Rongsheng, Fu Qixia, and Wang Bowen. After contact, they returned in vain for three minutes before McKinley's Owen Yi broke the dull atmosphere. He Zeng retaliated with a goal. McKinley's shots missed more than ten times, and the audience kept saying "Ah ya!" Wang Bowen scored a goal, and McKinley also improved. Owen Gaiqiaokesen, etc., scored four consecutive goals, leading 10-6. The Shanghai Police were quite surprised. After Jiuquan and Rongsheng worked hard, they were still no match for the harvest of their captain Liss alone. After 12-9, He Jingui replaced Bowen, and Rongsheng scored again and again, exceeding 13-12. The battle reached a tense stage. Soon it was tied 15-15. At halftime, McKinley still had a three-point advantage at 18-15.

At the beginning of the second half, Gofreyliss, etc., did not lose their prestige, 23-17. Liang Yongbiao replaced He Zeng. In an instant, it was 29-17. The Shanghai Police lost eleven consecutive points. McKinley's child Laimshan's superb skills were admirable. 31-17, He Zeng and Qixia entered, and Rongsheng and Jiuquan exited. The enemy's momentum still could not be suppressed. 37-24 Rongsheng replaced Jiuquan, and Bowen and Yongbiao also threw in one by one, 39-28. Rongsheng committed five fouls, and Jiuquan took his place. After that, the remaining game passed, 57-42, McKinley cheered loudly.

Huili B Beats Post and Telecommunications

In the second game, the Post and Telecommunications team in Group B faced the Huili B team. The Post and Telecommunications team was the overlord of Wuxi. Because they had to travel a long distance back and forth, they played two nights in a row, which inevitably reduced their performance. There were many good players in the Huili team, and they were quite confident in exploring the basket. At halftime, the score was 29-11, and the Post and Telecommunications team was at a disadvantage.

In the second half, the Post and Telecommunications team put up a strong fight, but the losses in the first half were ultimately irreparable. As a result, Huili won 52-38.

### The Malaysian Badminton Team Plans a European Tour

[Associated Press, Copenhagen] It is said that after the Danish team leader returned to his country, he deemed the cost of inviting Malaya to perform in Denmark as too high, fearing it would be unaffordable for a poor team like Denmark. They are now considering inviting Sweden to share the responsibility, as the Malayan team also intends to tour Sweden. If the Malayan team does come, they are expected to arrive in Copenhagen around the 10th, for an international match against Denmark. Afterwards, they will participate in the Danish Open International Singles and Doubles tournament from the 14th to the 18th. According to him, Denmark's crushing defeat this time was due to poor conditions and a sudden loss of form by the Danish players. However, he admitted that the Danish team's skills are indeed inferior to those of Malaya. Even without the possibility of winning, if the Danish players can perform to their usual standard, they can achieve a result of six to three or four to five, he said.

A Collection of Telegrams of Congratulations from Singapore

[Our Newspaper, Singapore, 1st] People in Singapore were extremely excited upon hearing the news of Malaya's victory in England. Telegrams of congratulations were sent one after another. The telegram from the Singapore Badminton Association Council stated: "Congratulations on your victory." The telegram from Chen Zhicheng, former Vice President of the Singapore Badminton Association, stated: "Congratulations on your victory. We are very proud of your victory."

Other sports organizations also sent telegrams congratulating the Malayan team on their victory. Wang Zhanghui, Chairman of the Malaysian Chinese Football Association, told reporters yesterday that the victory of the Malayan badminton team is a great encouragement to all athletes in this country. It shows that our country's athletes are as good as other world-class athletes. Now we need to wait for our football team and other teams to prove their high level.

It is also learned that the High Commissioner of the Federation of Malaya also sent a telegram to London yesterday, forwarding it to the Malayan badminton team, congratulating them on their glorious achievement.

What Mrs. Huang Bingshun Said

The sudden injury to the arm of Singapore's badminton champion Huang Bingshun, which prevented him from serving the Malayan team and attending the Thomas Cup finals in Bristol, caused regret among the people of Singapore, especially Mrs. Huang Bingshun. According to Mrs. Huang, Bingshun never mentioned anything else in his letters, only saying that he was in good health. His most recent letter, sent on February 12th, also said that everything was fine. My husband had an ambition to defeat Freeman of the United States. In his letter, he also said that he wanted to compete with Skov of Denmark. Now that he is unable to fight, he may not be able to attend the All England Badminton Championships. I believe he must be disappointed, and of course, we are also disappointed here.

The reporter pointed out that Huang Bingshun's withdrawal from the competition with Freeman when he learned of his arm injury was a wise move. Mrs. Huang replied, "Of course, but you don't know Bingshun's personality. He is a stubborn person. In a competition, no matter how injured he is, he never gives up halfway until the end. Therefore, even with an injured arm, he would have tried his best to defeat Freeman."

Comments from the Danish Champion

[Reuters, London, 5th] Danish badminton champion and Thomas Cup player Skov said today that Freeman of the United States is indeed the best singles player in the world. Skov said that the American badminton champion has strength and rarely makes mistakes in serving. Skov also recognized Wong Peng Soon as a good fighter.

Wong Peng Soon is a hero of Malaya and is truly worthy of admiration. Freeman fought him for forty-five minutes before a winner was decided.

### The Mystery of Crossing the River

— Special Correspondent Ling Songshou

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 12th] The Yangtze River, today, is not only a lifeline that the government relies on for preparing for war and seeking peace. In fact, it has become an indicator of which path the fate of China's 450 million people will take in the future. Naturally, peace and democracy are slogans that both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have always promoted. However, how to lead China on the path of peace and democracy, peacefully or through bloodshed, the Yangtze River here has its decisive role.

It is a fact that the CCP wants to cross the river, and it is also a fact that the government wants to defend the Yangtze River. Therefore, "To cross the river or not to cross the river?" has become the issue of most concern to everyone, from the government to the public.

Military Conference: Agreed on a Plan

This is an unconfirmed piece of news: In February, the Communist army convened a military conference in a certain area in the Central Plains. In addition to deciding that Chen Geng and Chen Yi would serve as commanders of the East and West Line Corps respectively, a preliminary plan for crossing the river was also drafted at the conference. According to this plan, Chen Yi would cross the river in the section below Anqing, focusing on Zhenjiang and Wuhu. After capturing Nanjing and Shanghai, he would go straight to Hangzhou. Chen Geng would lead the West Line Corps, cross the river from Sha (Shi) Yi (Chang), and then detour towards the Yuehan Railway. The Central Corps, with Lin Biao's troops as the main force, would point south to Changsha along the Yuehan Railway after defeating the Kuomintang army on the periphery of Wuhan, establish contact with Chen Geng on the West Line, then cut off the Zhegan Railway to spy on Jiujiang, and coordinate with Chen Yi's troops attacking Hangzhou. This is just a plan, and how much its accuracy is researched remains to be proven by future facts.

Assuming that we look at the Communist army's overall offensive to cross the river from the perspective of this plan, it naturally cannot be put into action until Lin Biao's troops have moved south in large numbers. The Ministry of National Defense reported that the 3rd and 5th columns of Lin's troops have arrived in the area south of Zhengzhou. Director Deng Wenyi in Shanghai also said that this information remains to be confirmed. Obviously, before the isolated island in the middle section of the Pinghan Railway—Xinxiang—is captured, the traffic on the Pinghan Railway is cleared, the large iron bridge in Jinan is repaired, and the Jinpu Railway cannot directly reach the traffic, it is still quite difficult for Lin Biao's troops to move south in large numbers in terms of transportation. What's more, in the southern section of Pinghan, between Jianghan and Dabie Mountain, General Bai Jiansheng is still commanding hundreds of thousands of troops, stationed in Wuhan. The Communist army naturally feels that the Kuomintang army in the Central China region is a thorn in their side, but before the deployment and preparation are mature, they must not act rashly.

Control of Military Force in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River

The upper reaches of the Yangtze River are mountainous and steep, and the river flows rapidly. Sichuan can still be considered a clean land, so there is no need to worry too much. In the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, below Sha Yi and above Anqing, although there is the Jianghan area that can be used as a springboard for crossing the river, hundreds of thousands of elite troops are gathered there. Before crossing the river, there must be a fierce battle. Therefore, what everyone is paying attention to today will be the section of the river below Anqing. On the north bank of this section of the river, the Kuomintang army only controls a few bridgehead positions, and most of the river surface is exposed to the Communist army.

Defending the river must first defend the Huai River. This is almost a consistent principle for defending the river from ancient times to the present. Despite the support of the navy, the concerns of fighting on the north bank of the river with one's back to the water can be reduced a lot. However, if the government's military authorities want to control a narrow strip of land nearly a thousand miles long on the north bank of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, it will require a very considerable force. It is no less difficult for the Kuomintang army to defend Nantong, Taixian, Yangzhou, Liuhe, Chuxian, Quanjiao, Chaoxian, and Lujiang. The withdrawal from Bengbu has already led the military to painfully decide to maintain the downstream river defense as it is today, because the Kuomintang army learned too much from the battle of Xubang.

How Easy is it to Cross the River in Front of the Enemy?

North of the Yangtze River and east of the Pinghan Railway, this vast Jianghuai Plain is entirely covered with red flags. From a topographical point of view, the Communist Party is likely not to abandon this springboard for crossing the river. In Jiangbei, the rivers intersect, which is conducive to controlling and using ships. In Jiangnan, the local communists in the Sanshan area have always been very active. They can use the Jinpu Railway facing Nanjing as the central line of advance, and use the canal line facing Zhenjiang and the Huainan Railway facing Wuhu as the roads for advancing from the left and right. Using these three major transportation arteries, they can concentrate their forces at a certain time to "cross the river in front of the enemy," perhaps by sneaking across, using the support of the local communists, occupying a few bridgeheads in Jiangnan, and then slowly expanding to create the most direct threat of "taking Nanjing directly."

However, how easy is it to "cross the river in front of the enemy"? Faced with the Kuomintang army's more than 400,000-strong army deployed on the first line of river defense in Jiangnan, plus the cooperation of the navy and air force, the Communist army cannot but consider it deeply. The change of tactics (because it is impossible to fill the Yangtze River with human wave tactics), the planning of transportation tools, the control of ships, and the preparation of grain and fodder are all still topics that the Communist army is thinking and planning deeply day and night.

Communist Army's Transfers are Extremely Busy

Currently, the Communist army on the north bank of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River is extremely busy transferring troops and generals. Chen Yi's eighteen columns were originally stationed on both sides of the southern section of Jinpu. After the transfer, the 1st, 4th, 13th, and New 8th columns remain in the southern section of Jinpu. In the vicinity of Hefei, there are the 6th, 7th (part), New 5th, New 6th columns, and the 37th Army. Part of the 7th column and the 35th Army are in the area of Huxian and Chaoxian. Between Tianchang and Xuyi in the east of Jinpu Road, there are four columns: the 2nd, 3rd, and Bohai, and Fast. Originally, there was only the Yangtze River Column in northern Jiangsu, divided into two parts stationed in Nantong and Jingjiang. Nantong has the 104th, 105th, and 106th regiments, and between Jingjiang and Huangqiao are the 101st, 102nd, and 103rd regiments. Since the beginning of this month, the 10th, 11th, and 12th columns, originally in the Lianghuai area, have moved south along the canal and arrived in Rugao, Taixian, and Yangzhou respectively. In addition, the Air Force discovered a Communist army of about 20,000 people on the Tongyu line. A week ago, the direction of this unit's actions was Dongtai. According to recent information, the 9th Column has been transferred to northern Jiangsu, located between Yang and Tai, and the 9th and 10th Columns have begun to move east from the 10th. The 11th Column, originally in Rugao, has been transferred to the area south of Rugao. According to the military's intelligence and judgment, the Communist army's eastward movement and target may be the Nantong Qidong area, with the intention of threatening Chongming Island. In addition, it is possible that Xu Shiyou's headquarters of the Communist Army's 10th Corps has been transferred to Huaiyin. This is because the 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and Liangguang columns are under Xu's command. Now, the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th columns have all been confirmed to be in northern Jiangsu, and the Liangguang column has also been confirmed to have arrived in Huaiyin. Therefore, Xu Shiyou's arrival in northern Jiangsu is naturally a very likely fact.

Deploying Troops on the Riverbank to Increase Pressure

The Communist army's footsteps are approaching the riverbank step by step. Facing the Communist army's artillery on the north bank of the river and the low pressure on the political stage in Nanjing, the people of Jiangnan are in a panic. Who is not worried about the "crossing the river" issue? The Communist army's intentions in transferring troops in northern Jiangsu, from a general point of view, are nothing more than two points: (1) To transfer and replenish new locations in order to be fast. (2) To deploy troops on the riverbank and threaten Nanjing and Shanghai, so as to further exert pressure on the government in the peace talks to demand whatever they want. From a military point of view, the Communist army will not rashly cross the river, especially since the CCP is still half-heartedly engaging in "peace talks." Before the peace talks break down, the CCP does not seem to launch a large-scale military operation to put the hat of "sabotaging peace talks" on its own head.

The Phenomenon of Disconnection is Worrying

If we do not deny that the Communist army has the intention of "crossing the river," then we do not need to be overly nervous about the current frequent troop transfers by the Communist army, as well as the fact that they are collecting grain and grass and building ships everywhere... The Communist army must prepare if it wants to cross the river. However, preparing is one thing, and whether the preparation has reached the required level is another. Today, no matter from a purely military standpoint or from a political standpoint, the Communist army's "crossing the river" not only needs to wait for a while, but also, unless there is a special change, the Communist army will not take the matter of crossing the river too easily. However, while listening to the military generals chanting "preparing for war and seeking peace," the local public opinion institutions have already raised the banner of stopping the collection of grain and corvée. Jiangnan is still disconnected, watching the seriousness of the economic crisis, the low political atmosphere, and the local communists in Jiangnan growing stronger day by day. This is indeed a worrying situation.

### Rural Women Come to Shanghai to Make a Living: Two Young Daughters are Separated from Their Mother at Danyang Station: No News for More Than Twenty Days, Family is in Great Pain

Our newspaper reader, Mr. Wang Longyun, rushed to the Social Services Department yesterday in distress, with a look of panic, as if overwhelmed by his sorrow. According to him, "Originally from Dongtai, northern Jiangsu, I am serving in Shanghai. Because my hometown is chaotic, my wife brought our five-year-old and two-year-old daughters to Shanghai on the 20th of last month to make a living. She first crossed the river to Zhenjiang and took a third-class train to Shanghai. When she arrived at Danyang Station, my wife got off the train alone to use the restroom. The people from the countryside had just arrived in Jiangnan and were riding a train for the first time. They were not familiar with the sanitary facilities on the train, so there was no need to get off the train. When she returned, the train had already left, and the two young children were unfortunately separated from their mother and went missing. Their mother was immediately panicked and cried uncontrollably. She took the next train to Shanghai to find her husband and told him about the loss of the children. The two hugged and cried with great sorrow. They had searched everywhere at the police stations of the two railway bureaus and Danyang Station, but to no avail. More than twenty days have passed, and there is still no news. I am requesting to publish a notice in the newspaper to reunite the family..." According to Mr. Wang and his wife, they only had two daughters, and they have been missing for a long time. The separation of family members is truly heartbreaking! Who doesn't have children? Comparing heart to heart, how can one not feel sad! Mr. Wang's wife is just a rural woman with no knowledge of riding a train, which caused the accident. If she had immediately asked Danyang Station to telegraph the Shanghai Bureau, they could have been reunited. This newspaper is complying with Mr. Wang's request to announce to the police officers and enthusiastic readers at each station from Shanghai to Danyang to investigate and find them. Those who have taken them in should send them back as soon as possible, which is a great deed. Also, Mr. Wang is currently working in a factory, and his monthly income is only a basic salary of eight yuan, so his hardship can be imagined. The missing children should be sent to the Social Services Department of this newspaper or No. 230, Huaian Road, telephone 31303, and there will be a generous reward. The clothing of the two children is as follows: "The older one is five years old, with long hair, wearing a small blue cotton-padded jacket, a red cotton robe, a plaid cloth leggings, black plaid cotton pants, cotton shoes, and a northern Jiangsu accent. The younger daughter is only two years old, wearing a small light blue silk crepe cotton-padded jacket, a blue crepe cotton robe, an outer woolen padded jacket, woolen cotton shoes, and cannot speak."
