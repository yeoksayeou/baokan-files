### The Situation on the Southern Section of the Pinghan Railway Becomes Tense; Nationalist Troops in Xinyang Ordered to Withdraw Voluntarily; Communist Troops Attacking Huayuan Suffer Losses and Retreat Westward

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 2nd] Military News: More than 10,000 Communist troops pressed upon the eastern suburbs of Xinyang last night. The defending troops, outnumbered, voluntarily withdrew from Xinyang at 5:00 PM, preparing to counterattack from another location. It is reported that some Communist troops entered the city area at 7:00 PM that evening.

[Our Huayuan Dispatch, 2nd] Military News: Lin Biao's forces, in large numbers, advanced south along the Pinghan Railway. After Nationalist troops proactively withdrew from Zhumadian, Queshan, and Luoshan, the terrain of Xinyang became increasingly prominent. To gain a tactical advantage, shorten the defense line, abandon insignificant points, and expand area control, thereby strengthening the outer defenses of Wuhan, the military authorities ordered the Xinyang garrison last night to complete necessary arrangements and then move to the vicinity of Wusheng Pass to await orders. No Communist troops have been found in that area yet. According to a senior general, the gain or loss of Xinyang will not affect the safety of the three towns of Wuhan, as the Nationalist army has concentrated four powerful corps in the outer and core positions of Wuhan after shortening the defense line, and the stable situation in Huayuan is a clear indication of this.

[Our Huayuan Dispatch, 2nd] The military authorities confirmed tonight: When the Nationalist troops in Xinyang withdrew last night, they left some commando units in the suburbs of the city to contain the advance of the main Communist forces. They also gathered more than 10,000 farmers' self-defense forces from the surrounding villages to cooperate with a certain unit of the Nationalist army in blocking the southward Communist forces north of Changhe Pass. It is also learned that Zhu Qiping, deputy commander of the Fifth Pacification Zone, and Gong Mengtao, chief intelligence officer, only led their troops to break through and retreat to the southwest of the railway at 7:00 PM last night when the Communist troops occupied the Yangshan line, a high ground north of the city. However, due to fighting along the way, they have not yet made contact with friendly forces as of 8:00 PM tonight. Furthermore, Zhang Yulong, commander of the Second Pacification Brigade of Henan Province, who broke through from Xinyang and passed through here this afternoon, told reporters that Deputy Commander Zhu Qiping may have remained near Xinyang after the farmers' self-defense forces gathered last night to command the battle, as sporadic fighting continued in the suburbs of Xinyang and south of the Huaihe River bridge until this morning.

[Our Huayuan Dispatch, 2nd] The focus of the battle on the Pinghan Railway has shifted to the plains of northern Hubei, north of Huayuan and south of Guangshui. About 20,000 Communist troops, including the Jianghan Column and the 28th and 30th Brigades of the Tenth Column, as well as the local Communist forces of Li Renlin and Wu Zhian, gathered on the west side of the railway. From the 30th to last night, they engaged in fierce fighting for more than 30 hours west of Huayuan with four regiments of Li Benyi's Nationalist army. As a result, the Communist troops suffered more than 8,000 casualties and more than 300 were captured.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 2nd] According to news this evening: The situation in Huayuan has stabilized. After being fiercely blocked by the elite troops of the Nationalist army, the Communist troops who attacked Huayuan were forced to flee towards Anlu this afternoon. Vehicles can now travel directly from northern Hubei to Wusheng Pass, but passenger and freight transport is still suspended due to busy military transport.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 2nd] A force of Nie Rongzhen's Communist troops, which moved south from Xiangfan in northern Hubei, has reached the vicinity of Lexiang Pass, north of Jingmen, and is attempting to infiltrate south between Jingmen and Dangyang.

### The Counter-Offensive by the Anqing Garrison Turns the Situation Stable; All Suburban Strongholds are Recaptured; Wangjiang and Susong Also Return to Nationalist Hands

[Our Wuhu Dispatch, 2nd] The once-critical situation in Anqing has gradually improved. After receiving substantial reinforcements, the Nationalist troops defending the city, under Tan Heyi, launched a fierce counterattack against the invading Communist troops on the morning of the 1st, with naval and air support. After a day of fierce fighting, they finally repelled the Communist troops and recaptured all the key points of Qipan Mountain and the Agricultural School, which had been lost on the 31st, killing or wounding more than 4,000 Communist troops. By this time, it had been confirmed that the Communist army's plan to occupy Anqing before the start of peace talks had failed. Although the Communist troops continued to attack on the 2nd, they have achieved nothing so far.

[Our Wuhu Dispatch, 1st] On the 2nd, the Nationalist troops in Anqing firmly defended the line stretching from Lion Mountain in the west, through Wulidun, Qipan Mountain, and east to the Agricultural School. Although the lines near Anqing, which were used by the Ministry of Communications' telecommunications bureau, have been destroyed passing through the fire line and cannot be repaired, causing wired telegraph and telephone communications to be interrupted, military radio communications are still unhindered. In addition, the Nationalist troops voluntarily abandoned the Tuchiao bridgehead position opposite Tongling on the 2nd.

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 2nd] Anqing is still firmly held by the Nationalist army. The invading Communist troops are constantly launching attacks on the suburbs of the city, but have made no significant progress. However, the Communist army's frontline troops in Anqing still show no signs of retreating. After the Communist troops entered Huayang Town on the opposite bank of Madang, there has been no movement to cross the river. The situation in Pengze and Hukou on the south bank is peaceful.

[Central News Agency, Anqing, 2nd] The Battle of Anqing is now entering its eleventh day, and the famous city remains intact. The Communist troops attacking Anqing total more than 50,000 as of now. The battle is conducted daily on the northeast, west, and east sides of the city. The eastern front is in the area of the Agricultural and Forestry Farm, the northern front is between Shilipu and Wulidun, and the western front is in the area of Shankouzhen and Fengjiapu, with the eastern front being the most intense, as it is close to the river and easily threatens the Yangtze River transportation. In the battles of the past ten days, approximately 14,000 Communist troops have been killed or wounded, 152 captured, and 158 have surrendered voluntarily. A large quantity of war booty has been seized. The Nationalist army has suffered more than 1,000 casualties.

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 2nd] After being counterattacked by the Nationalist army, the Communist troops who disturbed Wangjiang retreated north, and the county seat of Wangjiang returned to Nationalist hands. It is reported that the Communist troops in that area belong to Liu Bocheng's forces. Furthermore, after Susong fell into the hands of the Anhui-Jiangxi Independent Brigade of the Communist army, they were attacked by the Nationalist army yesterday and, unable to withstand the assault, fled towards Taihu. Susong City was then recaptured by the Nationalist army. The Nationalist troops in Taihu are still fighting the Communist army in the northeast of the county seat. The Taihu County government has withdrawn to Xunyang.

### A Landing Craft Passing Through Tuchiao is Fired Upon by Communist Troops

One Landing Craft Damaged by Gunfire

[Report from our Newspaper] Since the Communist army launched an offensive in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the bridgehead on the left bank of the river has become tense. Yesterday, reliable sources in the shipping industry reported that the Tuchiao bridgehead, upstream of Datong and downstream of Digang, had been lost. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's landing craft Zhongzi No. 107, as well as the Navy's Andong warship and the Jianghan steamer, traveling downstream from Hankou, were fiercely bombarded with artillery and machine-gun fire by Communist troops at 3:00 PM on the 1st, while on the Yangtze River surface in Tuchiao. Zhongzi No. 107 was hit by five artillery shells and countless machine-gun bullets. The pilothouse doors and windows and lifeboats were destroyed, and five officers and soldiers were killed and seven were wounded. The Andong warship and the Jianghan steamer immediately withdrew to Digang, and Zhongzi No. 107 urgently sailed to Datong and will return to Shanghai within days.

It is rumored that Chen Yi has arrived in Yangzhou to command the crossing-the-river deployment.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 2nd] Military News: The Communist troops in the Sanjiangying area continuously bombarded the defensive positions of the garrison from 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM on the 1st, firing a total of 70 rounds.

[Our Suojiang Dispatch, 2nd] According to visitors from Yizheng: Yizheng in northern Jiangsu is still in a peninsula-like state. Currently, the military and civilians of the county are cooperating sincerely to defend the city and surrounding strongholds under the threat of the Communist army from three sides. Xupu Bridge, a base for Communist activities that can threaten the river defenses at any time, is located directly west of the county. It was also recaptured by the Security Regiment on the 1st, and a strong bridgehead position is now being established.

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 2nd] Qingdao and the Communist areas reached an agreement on the exchange of goods on the 2nd: (1) A Qingdao Municipal Goods Exchange Committee will be established. (2) The goods to be exchanged with Ji'nan and Tianjin are coal, cotton, and peanuts, while the goods to be exported are cotton yarn, colored cloth, matches, paper, pigments, and bicycle tires. (3) Three representatives will be appointed: Chang Yinji of the power plant, one person from China Textile Corporation (the business section or materials section chief is to be determined), and one person from the match company. (4) A telegram was sent to Li Zhuchen, chairman of the Tianjin Industrial Association (previous telegrams were also in contact with Mr. Li), this afternoon to request his consent from the Communist side. The representatives will go to Ji'nan and then to Tianjin by land. They will visit Chairman Qin for instructions on Monday, and the first exchange is expected to be 30,000 tons of coal.

### Fu Zuoyi Issues a Circular Telegram, Hoping to Achieve Peace

[Report from our Newspaper] The Communist radio station broadcasted the full text of Fu Zuoyi's circular telegram signed on April 1st last night. The telegram's first paragraph expresses Fu Zuoyi's feelings over the past two and a half years and the origins of the tragic situation caused by the adverse phenomena in the country and society. The second paragraph describes Fu Zuoyi's personal observations and opinions on the Communist Party, hoping to achieve peace and engage in national construction. The radio station also broadcasted Mao Zedong's reply, praising Fu Zuoyi's factual performance as conducive to the advancement of the people's liberation cause and expressing welcome to his participation in the construction of the new democracy.

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 2nd] Song Zhijian, former chief of staff of the 29th Army, was visiting Beijing last winter and happened to be there during the local peace talks. He left Beijing on the 19th of last month and arrived in Qingdao on the 29th. On the 1st, he took the Jingxing steamer to Shanghai. Before his departure, he spoke frankly with our newspaper reporter about the issue of Fu Zuoyi's future, saying that when he left Beijing, he heard that Fu Zuoyi was considering issuing a statement to express his attitude. The Communist side subjectively hoped that he would express his support for Mao Zedong's line in the statement, actively obey the leadership of the Communist Party, and participate in their work. In other words, he would be transformed into a member of the Communist Party's camp.

### The Government Investigates the Responsibility for the Conflict Between Students and Military Officers; the Military Officer Reception Headquarters Must Move to Outside the City Within Five Days; Universities in Nanjing are in a State of Strike

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The capital is calm today. No further incidents have occurred between the students and the military officer reception headquarters. The situation is not expected to escalate. The public security authorities are maintaining strict security to maintain order. The government has decided to organize a committee to thoroughly investigate the truth of the incident and investigate the responsibility of those who caused the trouble. The military officer reception headquarters originally located in the city has been ordered to move to outside the city within five days. The government will be responsible for the medical expenses of the injured students. At the same time, the authorities of each university are required to strictly order students not to hold parades or demonstrations during the martial law period.

Premier He Yingqin summoned Garrison Commander Zhang Yaoming today and inquired in detail about the course of this unfortunate incident, and gave instructions on the aftermath. Zhang Yaoming has submitted a request for punishment, holding himself responsible as the chief of public security for failing to properly fulfill his responsibilities when students were beaten during the parade. Minister of Education Hang Liwu sent personnel to the scene of the incident today to investigate in detail, and personally visited the hospitals where the students were being treated to express his condolences. He then went to the Garrison Headquarters and asked Commander Zhang Yaoming to take responsibility for properly maintaining order in the schools so that the students can continue their studies in peace.

The student unions of major universities convened a joint meeting of the presidium this morning and decided to organize an aftercare committee, announcing an indefinite strike starting immediately. Eleven universities including Central University, National Chengchi University, and Jinling University have entered a state of strike. The Central University School Affairs Maintenance Committee is scheduled to convene a discussion meeting of student representatives from various departments on the morning of the 3rd. Before the meeting, they hope that students will not take any action internally or externally. The students are now demanding that the government investigate responsibility, severely punish the perpetrators, send telegrams to the peace representatives of both the Nationalists and the Communists, and appeal to students across the country for support. It is learned that the committee has sent representatives to Shanghai to attend the student union of Jiaotong University, report on the process, and request the adoption of the same attitude.

### The Executive Yuan Takes Four Measures

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Regarding the conflict between parading students and officers of the Third Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters Reception Headquarters on the 1st, the Executive Yuan is very concerned about this incident and has taken the following four measures: (1) Order the Ministry of Education and the Capital Garrison Headquarters to jointly investigate the responsibility so as to make a just handling, and invite the principals and professors of the relevant schools to assist in the investigation to ensure fairness. (2) Order the Capital Garrison Headquarters to move all officers of the reception headquarters in the city to outside the city within five days, properly resettle them, and those who arrive later should be moved at any time. (3) Order the Minister of Interior and the Minister of Education to personally visit the injured in the hospital and ask the hospitals to treat them carefully. All medical expenses will be borne by the government. (4) The Ministry of Education will ask the heads of the universities to persuade the students to study in peace during this extraordinary period, and not to have gatherings, parades, and acts, so as not to violate the martial law and affect social order.

### Demanding the Release of Those Arrested, Students Issue Written Statement

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The aftercare committee organized by university students in Nanjing and the emergency meeting of universities in Nanjing held a reception for the press at 5:00 PM on the 2nd and issued a "written statement" explaining the purpose of the parade and petition on the 1st: "To fight for survival: to improve the treatment of teachers, students, and staff, to increase education funding; to fight for freedom: to release arrested students, to implement the seven promises of Acting President Li, to protect human rights, to strive for true peace, to oppose US aid, to oppose disguised peace, to oppose conscription of soldiers, conscription of grain, and conscription of real goods." The statement pointed out that the injured students were subjected to "planned beatings by armed secret agents and executioners." They also pointed out that some injured and missing students had been arrested and sent to the Garrison Headquarters Reception Team for detention, demanding their immediate release. At the same time, they demanded that the government thoroughly investigate the truth of the incident, investigate responsibility, severely punish the perpetrators, and provide condolences to the dead and injured students and their families. Finally, they stated that they would continue to carry out the "struggle against hunger, against persecution, for survival, for freedom, and for democracy."

### Preliminary Contacts Begin for Peace Talks; Mainly Related to Military Affairs; Technical Issues of Negotiation Also Involved

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] After the government peace delegation arrived in Beijing, it began informal contacts with the six Communist representatives on the 2nd, broadly exchanging views on relevant negotiations. Wireless communication between Beijing and Nanjing has begun. The activities and contacts of the delegation are being reported to Acting President Li and Premier He in Nanjing via radio telegram. However, the government and the Communist Party agreed that the content of the negotiations cannot be published without the consent of both parties. According to authoritative sources this evening: the contacts in Beijing on the 2nd did not involve the eight conditions proposed by the Communist Party. The focus of the initial talks was mainly related to military affairs. That side refused to confirm the external rumors that the government suggested that both parties stop military actions and defend their original positions, but stated that peace talks are in line with national public opinion, and since the peace talks have begun, the cessation of military actions should be possible. In addition, the contacts on the 2nd also involved technical issues of negotiation. The government delegation is staying at Zhongnanhai in Beijing, and the Communist side is providing very good hospitality and freedom of movement.

[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 1st] Well-informed sources said: In the peace talks that began today in Beijing, the Chinese Communists do not seem likely to make any real concessions to the Nationalist government delegation. Communist radio has clearly broadcast that the Communist Party cannot form a coalition government with "reactionaries," and the Communist Party apparently regards the Nanjing representatives as representatives of a "semi-feudal" government.

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 2nd] The peace delegation's special plane "Tianwang" (Heavenly King) is still staying in Beijing, but this is not the intention of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC). The company sent a telegram to the personnel of the Beijing office this afternoon, requesting its immediate return, but the Communist side indicated that it would be postponed.

In addition, Chen Shouzhun, a professor at Central University and the Drama Academy, was detained for a while by the officer team when he went to the Dazhong Bridge yesterday to persuade them to stop. He was released after showing his identity. According to the representatives of the Drama Academy, one staff member of the school was also detained and his whereabouts are still unknown.

### Zhang Yaoming's Statement

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Zhang Yaoming issued the following statement: (1) This capital is a martial law area. Students' petitions and parades have been repeatedly dissuaded and solemnly declared in newspapers to stop them. At the same time, Acting President Li and Premier He were asked for instructions. We were told that if dissuasion was ineffective, protection would be provided along the way and order maintained. This headquarters followed the order to handle the situation, so no incidents occurred from the time of assembly to the time of dispersal of the parade. (2) Unexpectedly, after the parade dispersed, some students and some officers and soldiers of the reception team had a mutual fight, and both sides were injured. I am responsible for the security of the capital. Although this incident was accidental, this headquarters did not take adequate precautions beforehand, and I cannot shirk my responsibility. I have now asked my superiors for punishment. (3) After the incident, I strictly ordered the officers and soldiers of the reception team that if they cause trouble outside again, they will be dealt with according to military law. The officers of the reception team will be evacuated immediately, and those who arrive later will be transferred immediately. I also hope that the authorities of each school will restrain the students and strictly abide by martial law, and not gather in parades again to avoid new incidents.

These figures differ significantly from those reported by the students.

### The Attitude of the Communist Side

[Report from our Newspaper] In broadcasts last night, the Communist radio station launched a fierce attack on the conflict between university students and officers of the Garrison Headquarters Reception Headquarters in Nanjing, denouncing the incident as "the Nationalist reactionary government's continued implementation of the counter-revolutionary war policy under the guise of a peace conspiracy." At the same time, it pointed out that the beating of the students was carried out by pre-positioned National Army personnel and "secret agents."

### Silver Dollar Deposits or Currency Exchange?

— Jiang Guoyan

(1) Distinguishing Names from Reality

The whiteness of a white horse is not the whiteness of white snow. In academia, this is the distinction between names and reality. In practical application, it concerns gains and losses. The distinction between names and reality can sometimes be ignored, but gains and losses cannot. Although equal-value deposits and silver dollar deposits differ only slightly in form, their actual consequences are diametrically opposed. A debate is necessary.

Advocates of silver dollar deposits divide deposit methods into: (1) depositing silver and returning silver, that is, both receipts and payments are in kind, which can be said to be the orthodox school; (2) depositing notes and returning notes, which, to be accurate, should be "depositing value and returning value," where both receipts and payments are nominal, which is what people now advocate as "equal-value deposits," and should not be mistakenly categorized here; (3) depositing notes and returning silver, which is receiving nominal and returning real. Proponents have already deemed depositing silver and returning silver to be of little significance in the current monetary situation and should be postponed. Now, let's discuss depositing notes and returning silver.

(2) Not Deposits, but Currency Exchange

Depositing notes and returning silver inherently falls into the error of using material goods to entice currency recall. It violates the purpose of the financial industry, which focuses on currency. Because silver dollars currently only have commodity value and not monetary function. It is currency exchange, not deposits. Its success or failure can be learned from currency exchange policies.

Depositing notes and returning silver is premised on protecting people's savings and purchasing power. It should be known that protection should be under certain conditions. Once these conditions disappear, protection should also end. Protecting savings and purchasing power should be done before continuous savings and the act of purchasing goods. Once a note is deposited for silver, the condition of the deposit has disappeared, but its protection continues forever. This is very different from equal-value deposits, where the guarantee ends immediately after withdrawal. Therefore, it is the protection of material goods.

This type of deposit is based on market prices, which is naturally more flexible than the so-called balancing fee ultimately used in currency exchange policies. However, it is an inevitable fact that listed prices and market prices can never match at all times. Especially during inflation, the faster the inflation, the more the market price will fluctuate. After the gold and silver market opens, the market price of silver dollars may change several times in an instant. The listed price can never be changed every minute or second. Even if the listed price is changed three or four times a day, there will inevitably be times of difference. It is not difficult to use this difference for profit. For example, Mr. A deposits one million Gold Yuan notes at 9:00 am according to the listed price of 5,000 to one as a current deposit. According to regulations, he can obtain 200 silver dollars at any time. If the difference between the market price and the listed price is only slightly 50 or 25 yuan, then selling 200 silver dollars and depositing them again can yield a profit of one or two silver dollars. This is protecting speculative power, not savings or purchasing power. At least several cycles can be made in a day. If one person does this, thousands or hundreds of people can also do this. Even if silver dollars are unlimited, the receiving and paying bank will be unable to cope. The result is imaginable whether it is the same as the bank run during the currency exchange policy. The listed price, due to the convenience of depositing and withdrawing, has lost its function of restricting profitable behavior. "Deposits" then become "currency exchange."

The most important thing is currency recall. The government has repeatedly boasted that 20 million US dollars can recover all currency. We might as well go further and assume that all of the government's silver dollars can recover four times or more of the current total currency. As a result of depositing notes and returning silver, the first currency recall loses one-quarter of the silver dollars. Subsequently, the pressure of the deficit causes the Gold Yuan notes to be issued again. The second time, another quarter of the silver dollars are taken back. If this continues to the fourth time, all the silver dollars will be lost, and the fifth issuance of Gold Yuan notes will have nothing to rely on, and it will inevitably be forced to stop returning silver. Deposits also disappear due to the disappearance of the temptation. May I ask what is the difference from suspension of exchange? Moreover, the government has absolutely no such large amount of silver dollars, so it is currency exchange, not deposits.

The government's currency exchange policy was originally intended to maintain monetary confidence and inform the people. From unlimited to limited, to adding a "balancing fee," it finally led to suspension of exchange. On the surface, it is said that the disparity between the currency exchange price and the market price gives profiteers an opportunity to exploit. However, the reason why the currency exchange price and the market price differ is due to restrictions. Restrictions are the cause of black market soaring, not its result. Why must we plant this evil cause and eat this evil fruit? In a word, limited inventory cannot withstand unlimited issuance. Is the inevitable failure of the currency exchange policy necessarily known only after a bank run? Even a currency exchange policy with limitations is still like this. Deposits with absolutely no limitations, its success or failure can also be predicted. Depositing notes and returning silver is virtually no different from currency exchange except in wording. It can be called the second currency exchange policy.

Furthermore, the handling of this deposit, it is said that it is appropriate for banks to handle freely. But since the deposit is in Gold Yuan notes, where will the returned silver dollars come from? If supplied by the Central Bank, the Central Bank, in addition to the loss of silver dollars, should also be responsible for the interest on the remaining balance of the bank. The use of deposits then falls into the hands of the bank. For the bank, it can be said to be foolproof. But to use the national treasury for the profit of a few people, how can it be fair to the general public?

The above are the inherent defects in the principle of "depositing notes and returning silver," and its success or failure can already be predicted. Let's go further and examine the consequences it gives to the national economy.

(3) Consequences of Silver Dollar Deposits

How depositing notes and returning silver will be used, the commentators have not explained. If it is issuing notes and returning notes, then it is not a silver dollar deposit, as mentioned earlier. If it is issuing silver and returning notes or issuing notes and returning silver, then creditors and debtors will inevitably be dissatisfied. Now, let's assume that it is issuing silver and returning silver, the same as depositing silver and returning silver.

If the bank does not use silver dollars, then the silver dollars will not yield any income and must lose storage fees, that is, it is purely a commodity and not currency. But the bank will not be disheartened and must lose the interest paid, so it must undoubtedly restore the monetary function of silver dollars. If the government does not give it legal tender status in advance, the borrower can refuse to repay in silver dollars at any time. Therefore, in order to obtain legal protection, the bank, although it does not have to force the government to stop issuing Gold Yuan notes, must force the government to recognize the legal tender status of silver dollars. Silver dollars then seize the throne of the standard, and industry, commerce, and the entire public have no choice but to receive and pay in silver dollars. Thus, except for odd amounts below the yuan, the Gold Yuan note is forced to retreat from the industrial sector and the doors of those above the middle class, and is reduced to the currency of the poor who cannot use the yuan as a unit for each receipt and payment. What will be the result?

Before the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan, although the silver dollar was the standard currency for receipts and payments, there were foreign taels above it, and silver dimes and copper coins as subsidiary currencies below it. At that time, the subtle connection between the circulation of foreign taels and the value of silver dollars should still be remembered by people. However, since foreign taels were nominal and only the currency of a very small number of comprador classes, and there was free arbitrage to regulate it, its advantages and disadvantages were generally ignored. And copper coins as change often posed a great threat to the lower and middle classes in large cities, especially Shanghai. This fact should also still be remembered by people. At that time, if one could manipulate the exchange rate between copper coins and silver dollars, it would be like holding the most convenient weapon of exploitation. The silver dimes and copper coins earned by coolie laborers in the morning and afternoon were exchanged for silver dollars in the evening, whether for savings or for the purpose of purchasing things worth more than one yuan, they could not help but suffer a loss of value invisibly. Silver dimes and copper coins with commodity prices were already like this, let alone banknotes that are inflating daily. Its harm must be even greater. After the issuance of large banknotes, small banknotes have caused great harm to the poor, let alone silver dollars. Therefore, the result of silver dollar deposits will inevitably cause endless persecution to the poor, unless the inflating currency is abandoned first.

The permission to circulate and trade silver dollars was already stipulated not to be prohibited on November 12 last year. On February 26, there was even the following encouragement. However, from the era of legal tender until now, except for places that rely on regional political power for support, it has always regarded itself as a commodity and has not restored its monetary nature. That is, there is the act of buying and selling, but there is no phenomenon of circulation. The crux of this is worth pondering. Today's people oppose the government's explicit use of silver dollars for this reason. It is also said that there is no need to prohibit it because it is a commodity and not currency.

(4) Conclusion

In short, for any policy to stabilize the current monetary value, it should be known: (1) The government is a Necessary evil. We have the right to choose each other, but not to abandon it, that is, we must have something to support it. (2) The consequences of the policy should be seen through, so that it does not persecute the masses and be used by a few or special classes.

As an aside, using customs gold units or silver dollars as a denomination, as long as Gold Yuan notes are not rejected for receipts and payments, there is no need to oppose or prohibit it. Prices that are too high are not the fault of the unit of account. If US dollars or Hong Kong dollars are used as denominations, it should be absolutely prohibited. That is the dignity of the nation, it is political rather than economic. If the government strongly prohibits using customs gold units or silver dollars as a denomination in the name of disrupting the monetary system, it will not only be ridiculed for lighting a lamp to start a fire, but will also commit suicide and lose credibility.

### The CCP Strengthens the "Bamboo Curtain" in Peiping and Tianjin to Rebuild University Education; 3,000 University Students are Confined to Concentration Camps for Re-education; "I Chose Freedom" is Confiscated

[United Press, Nanjing, 2nd] A famous Chinese professor, who recently arrived here from North China, said on the 2nd that the CCP is gradually strengthening its "bamboo curtain" in Peiping and Tianjin. This famous professor has no political affiliation and is an absolutely neutral person. He asked reporters not to publish his surname for the sake of the safety of his family still in Peiping.

He said that the initial goals of the CCP in sovietizing Peiping and Tianjin are to control the press, rebuild university education, and squeeze out unwelcome foreigners. He said that the CCP has now completed its first goal and turned its attention to rebuilding university education, trying to make the universities comply with communism, and forcing foreigners to leave, but Soviet citizens are clearly not included among the unwelcome foreigners. Soviet citizens in Peiping and Tianjin enjoy full freedom of movement. The CCP allowed the use of their vehicles from the day it occupied Peiping and Tianjin. He said that he personally saw Soviet technicians serving on the Peiping-Tianjin Railway. At the same time, according to two students who had returned to Peiping after visiting their hometowns in the Northeast, the stationmasters of all stations on the Chinese Eastern Railway are Soviets, and there are Soviet guards stationed at each station.

The CCP is discussing the reconstruction of university education with so-called democratic professors. The current restrictions placed on university courses are: (1) Prohibiting the teaching of Roman law; (2) Changing social science courses to "study sessions" to discuss communism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong's New Democracy. Natural science courses are allowed to be taught as usual; (3) Anti-communist books have been removed from the libraries of all schools. Kravchenko's "I Chose Freedom" is particularly opposed by the CCP, and even the books in bookstores have been confiscated.

In addition, the CCP has concentrated 3,000 university students who are suspected of being spies or members of the Kuomintang's Three Principles of the People Youth League, the Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party in a large-scale concentration camp inside Deshengmen for re-education. At the same time, the CCP has launched a movement to encourage students to abandon education and join the army or engage in propaganda work.

The CCP has also established four universities with four-month courses, where even students with only elementary school education can enroll. These four universities are North China University, North China People's Revolutionary University, North China Political and Military University, and the Southward Work Personnel Training Academy. The academy aims to train political and administrative personnel to prepare for the takeover of South China.

### Peiping and Tianjin Students Fight for Freedom; More Than a Thousand Refugees Flee to Guangzhou

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 2nd] Since the CCP occupied Peiping and Tianjin, a large number of students have fled south. According to the Youth Re-enrollment Guidance Committee of the Ministry of Education here, since the Communist Party ruled Peiping and Tianjin, more than 1,000 students from schools such as Normal University, Dong University, Zhong University, and Chang University have fled to Guangzhou.

### Returned Soldiers from Communist Areas Stranded in Qingdao Continue to be Sent South

Authorities Will Stop Receiving Them in the Future

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 2nd] There are still more than 10,000 returned soldiers from the Communist areas stranded in Qingdao. They were once temporarily suspended from being sent south, but now, under the order of the Ministry of National Defense, they continue to be sent south. According to reliable sources, senior military authorities intend to stop receiving returned soldiers. The front line remains strictly blocked, and a telegram has been sent to Chief of Staff Gu for consideration.

### Zhejiang Sea Fishing Season is Approaching; Provincial Government Loans Rice to Fishermen

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 2nd] The Zhejiang sea fishing season is approaching, and fishermen are unable to fish due to lack of funds, which not only affects the livelihoods of fishermen but also concerns the security of the coastal areas. The provincial government has ordered the use of one-third of the provincial grain and two-thirds of the county grain to lend to fishermen directly engaged in production, totaling 13,669 shi of rice, of which Ningzhou accounts for 45%, Wenzhou 30%, and Taizhou 25%. At the same time, the province is still borrowing 50,000 shi of rice from the Central Agricultural Bank for fishing loans.

### Taiwan Provincial Defense Bureau Abolished

### After the Conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Trade Agreement, a Large Number of Raw Materials Will Be Shipped to the Soviet Union

[United Press, this city] Reliable sources say that after the conclusion of the new Sino-Soviet Trade Agreement, a large number of raw materials from the western and northwestern provinces of China will flow to the Soviet Union. The draft of the new Sino-Soviet Trade Agreement, negotiated in Dihua, has been completed and is now being reviewed by Nanjing and Moscow. The terms of the agreement have not yet been announced, and the content has not been revealed. The source said that, in general, the new Sino-Soviet Trade Agreement stipulates the extension of the Sino-Soviet 25-year aviation agreement. According to the aviation agreement, the Soviet Union can exclusively occupy commercial aviation rights between Xinjiang and the Soviet Union. It also stipulates that the Soviet land trade routes will extend further into the eastern and southeastern regions, so that cotton, agricultural products, minerals, and other raw materials can be transported to the Soviet Union.

Informed sources said that the issue of granting the Soviet Union the rights to mine, reclaim, and explore for oil was not included in the drafting of the treaty. The previous rumor was incorrect. The source also said that the Soviet Union also made some concessions to China, allowing China to open up the borders between the western and northwestern regions of China and the Soviet Union. Currently, the Sino-Soviet border in that area is closed to trade.

### Pan Gongzhan Attends a Meeting and Delivers a Speech in Wuxing: There is Only One Way to Peace: Ceasefire and Divide the Country for Political Competition

[Our Newspaper, Wuxing, 31st] Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and his wife returned to Huzhou on March 30 to sweep the tombs. On March 31, at the invitation of the 9th Session of the 1st Wuxing County Council, he attended and delivered a speech, generally saying: "Wuxing is relatively stable at present and is a land of peace and purity." He believes that "everything here is still quite stable, which is really not easy." He continued, "Now the people's suffering is deep, at least there are unsatisfactory places. I hope that public opinion organs will give full play and do not avoid speaking out. However, for small matters, we should look at the big environment. If there is a change in the big environment, the small scope will definitely be affected." Therefore, he contributed his views on the big environment: "So far, the government has made no preparations for the peace talks plan. This time, the peace talks representatives flew to Peiping, and the government authorized the representatives to let them manage all the people's future lives, systems, and thoughts, which is really very dangerous." He also analyzed that if this peace talk is not successful, there are only two ways: one is that the discussion hits a snag at any point, so the peace talk is shelved, and then there is fighting; the other is that while the meeting is going on, the cannons are firing, so there is no interest in talking anymore, and there is still fighting. He continued, "The most important issue in the peace talks is the coalition government. If the government agrees, this is extremely dangerous, because the Soviet Union hopes to use the relationship with the CCP to pull China into their camp. Once a coalition government is formed, the CCP can control the whole country like the Netherlands and Czechoslovakia, and lean towards the Soviet Union, and use China as a gambling chip for war. The United States has 140 million people. If half of the Chinese die, there are still 200 million. The Soviet Union can train the Chinese people and immediately launch a war. At that time, it will not be just one or two battles in the Yangtze River. The blood of young people will not flow for the country, but for the Soviet Union. Therefore, a peace chosen out of desperation is not a truly permanent peace." He pointed out that the only way out is: "The people must all rise up, take care of the vitality of the country, and demand a ceasefire on both sides, divide the country for political competition, and let's have a political competition to see under which ideology the people can have faith? But there must be strength to let the CCP know that it cannot cross the river, so that the country can be divided for political competition. Therefore, the Yangtze River maintains half of the country and also determines the fate of China." Finally, he said: "If the Yangtze River can be defended for three months to a year, China still has hope, and it can avoid a great catastrophe. If this bit of strength cannot be exerted, then we can only let the CCP slaughter us. At that time, we will not be able to speak, not be able to be angry, not be able to hate, and it will be too late to regret it. So I want to find a way to contribute in the last five minutes," he said.

The United States was represented by Acheson and State Department advisor Bohlen. Today, Acheson also convened all members of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations General Assembly for a full day of discussion, instructing them on strategy for the meeting. Acheson expects the Soviet Union to launch a full-scale attack on the North Atlantic Treaty during the General Assembly.

Because the treaty will be signed on Monday and the General Assembly will open on Tuesday, the State Department will remain open as usual on the weekend. The General Assembly will open with an address by Chairman Spaak, the Belgian Foreign Minister.

Willing to Study the Pacific Pact

[This Newspaper News] New York, 2nd, broadcast: Churchill held a press conference on the Queen Mary liner today before leaving. He said that he earnestly wished that Western countries could become good friends with the Soviet people.

### The Atlantic Pact is a Bulwark for Peace The U.S., Britain, and France Reject Soviet Protests The Next Soviet Action May Be to Tear Up Treaties with Britain and France

[Reuters, London, 1st] Diplomatic observers here believe that the Soviet Union's protest note on the Atlantic Pact, which states that the conclusion of the treaty violates treaties signed by the treaty countries with the Soviet Union, is intended to prepare for the declaration that all previous treaties signed by the Soviet Union with the treaty countries are invalid. The protest also states that the Atlantic Pact violates the United Nations Charter, indicating that the Soviet Union will raise the issue of the Atlantic Pact at this session of the General Assembly. The Anglo-Soviet Twenty-Year Treaty of Friendship was signed in London in 1942, and the Franco-Soviet Treaty was signed in Moscow in 1944, both stipulating that "each signatory shall not enter into an alliance with other countries or participate in any alliance against the other signatory."

Two Meanings of the Western Alliance

[United Press, Washington, 1st] Spokesmen for the U.S., Britain, and France coldly refuted the Soviet Union's protest that the Atlantic Treaty was aggressive, asserting that the treaty was a bulwark for peace. British Foreign Secretary Bevin said that the Atlantic Treaty may be the greatest factor contributing to world peace. The treaty has two meanings: first, a permanent solution to future peace must be decided in the next year; second, the treaty will combine manpower, military assistance, and economic assistance into one.

No Fear of Aggression

A U.S. State Department spokesman said that the treaty was purely defensive in nature, and that Moscow could prevent the defense measures under the Atlantic Pact from being implemented simply by not attacking anyone, as Article 5 of the treaty stipulates that the treaty countries will only take collective self-defense action when a treaty country is subjected to armed attack. Most of the Soviet Union's protest is for propaganda purposes, and the State Department has not yet decided whether to formally respond. Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that if the Soviet Union does not intend to launch an armed attack, the treaty will not harm the Soviet Union.

### U.S. Extends Lease on Saudi Arabian Air Force Base New Agreement to Be Announced Soon

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 1st] Well-informed sources say that a new agreement between the United States and Saudi Arabia on the large air force base in Dhahran will be announced soon. In the previous agreement, the U.S. Air Force had complete control of the base from 1946 to 1949. The recent negotiations between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are related to revising and extending the validity of the agreement, which will expire on March 15 this year. Well-informed sources said that the new agreement will stipulate that U.S. civilian airlines will also have broad rights to use the Dhahran airport.

### Soviet Newspaper Criticizes Western Alliance Calling it a Black Pact

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 1st] Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg published an article in the "Life and Culture" weekly today, denouncing the Atlantic Pact as a "black pact." He said that no matter what attitude the governments take, the people of Europe will never approve the black pact. Congressional approval is one thing, and the people's approval is another. Others can buy off a certain Italian senator or intimidate a certain Danish congressman, but the people can never be bought off. The people of Europe will never approve this aggressive pact, because they do not want their traditional culture to be destroyed due to the mistakes of thousands of merchants who want to get rich through war. Ehrenburg continued, "War vendors can issue orders, but they lack troops, because the people refuse to fight. The world has been divided into two major camps, namely builders and destroyers, defenders of peace and supporters of war. France, Italy, and Britain themselves are also divided into two, and the United States is also encountering the same situation, with domestic supporters of peace launching an offensive."

### Some U.S. Congressmen Advocate U.S.-Soviet Peace Talks

[United Press, Washington, 1st] One of the most influential members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Democrat Mansfield, said that he knew that several members of Congress had suggested to Truman the possibility of starting U.S.-Soviet peace talks after the completion of the Atlantic Pact. Mansfield said, "The purpose of these talks is clearly to reach an agreement that all parties can fulfill, in order to lay the foundation for world peace." Some diplomats here have long believed that Western countries will try again at the appropriate time to persuade the Soviet Union to take a more conciliatory attitude towards them in order to end the "Cold War." They believe that the situation has reached a balance because the Western European recovery plan is gradually progressing and security has been improved by the conclusion of the Atlantic Pact. Under these circumstances, Western countries can negotiate with the Soviet Union on an equal footing, but the State Department has no indication of any such plan.

### Southeast Asian Countries Support Australian-Indian Proposal

To Place the Indonesian Question on the UN General Assembly Agenda

[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] According to well-informed sources, the joint proposal of Australia and India has received the support of the nineteen countries that participated in the Southeast Asian Conference in January this year. These countries are all members of the United Nations and can participate in the UN General Assembly debates.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 1st] The Dutch and British delegations are quite supportive of the Australian and Indian proposal to discuss the Indonesian question at the United Nations General Assembly to be convened on April 4. On the other hand, the Indonesian representatives welcomed the Australian and Indian proposal. British and Dutch representatives in Lake Success privately believe that it is unfortunate that the United Nations is discussing the Indonesian question at a time when Indonesia and the Netherlands are about to begin preliminary negotiations.

### Burmese Government Uncovers Another Coup Plot

Recapture of Mandalay Delayed As a Result

[Reuters, Rangoon, 1st] Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu revealed in a radio address today that the government has uncovered a plot by a certain political party in northern Burma to attack the government when government forces launch a counterattack on Mandalay. Therefore, the government forces' plan to recapture Mandalay had to be delayed. The political party planned to seize Katha, Monywa, Shwebo, Sagaing, and other places in northern Burma. The situation in northern Burma is now completely under government control.

[Another Dispatch] According to an announcement by the Burmese government, government forces launched a counterattack on the Mandalay front and recaptured Wetwun, an important base of the Karen rebels. The Burmese Air Force bombed the Karen rebel base of Taikkyi, 100 miles south of Mandalay, with most of the bombs hitting their targets directly.

### Stetson Advocates Allocating $10 Billion to Promote MacArthur's Aid-to-Asia Plan Take Swift Action to Reverse the Reddening of China Situation

[Reuters, Boston, 1st] Stetson, who participated in the Republican presidential nomination race last year, delivered a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology today, calling for swift action to revitalize the un-reddened half of China. Stetson also advocated launching a MacArthur Plan to aid Asia in eradicating communism, allocating $10 billion annually for aid to Asia. Stetson exclaimed, "Standing idly by and withdrawing aid is tantamount to assisting the Communist Party in ruling China, which is extremely foolish. We should take into account the needs of Europe and our own economic capabilities, but we should also regularly use a portion of our resources in Asia to resist communism. This amount should be at least $10 billion per year. This aid-to-Asia plan should be used to support indigenous and private plans in Asian countries, rather than being used by any central government. The Marshall Plan is the most important and most righteous thing we have done since the end of the war. We should now launch a similar MacArthur Plan in Asia. This plan should have a long-term vision, be continuously implemented, have the same implementation details as the Marshall Plan, and have the same goals. At the same time, it should also require the recipient countries to engage in self-help, as with the Marshall Plan. The only concern of Soviet aggression is the strength to resist such aggression. The Soviet Union believes that some people will eventually implement military rule, so from their point of view, it is better for them to rule by force. Therefore, unless influenced by internal or external pressure, they will not automatically give others strength, give human rights, or give freedom. If we link this inevitable situation with the special question we face, we have to believe that our standing idly by, withdrawing aid, and thus assisting the Communist Party in ruling China is extremely foolish. We must act quickly to revitalize the remaining half of China." Stetson also suggested using balloons and high-altitude aircraft to spread anti-communist propaganda. Stetson is currently the president of Bennington College.

[United Press, Boston, 2nd] Stetson's speech emphasized aid to southern China, which resonated with Republican Senator Flint. It is said, "I fear we are already a bit behind. A year ago, I proposed to former Secretary of State Marshall that we do something in the Yangtze River basin and southern China, just as the Marshall Plan did in Europe. Abandoning northern China is sound economics, but I don't know if we can still do this now."

### France Increases Aid to Vietnam

And Reviews Tactics for Suppressing the Viet Minh

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 2nd] The People's Republican Movement newspaper L'Aube reported today that the French government has decided to send new reinforcements to Vietnam and to review whether it is possible to modify the tactics for suppressing the Viet Minh army. The newspaper said that the two decisions were passed by the Supreme National Defense Committee on the 28th. The first decision is to immediately send reinforcements of about ten battalions to Vietnam, with the reinforcements carrying about 500 various tanks and some fighter planes. The second decision, according to L'Aube, is to send the Chief of the Defense Staff, Revers, to Vietnam to personally inspect the situation and decide whether the current military tactics should be changed, especially the tactic of reducing the size of French units and stationing them in various areas. L'Aube also said that the French cabinet meeting also decided to instruct French Foreign Minister Schuman, who is currently visiting Washington, to urge U.S. officials to pay attention to the great military and diplomatic significance of the Vietnam situation.

### Britain and the U.S. Lodge Strong Protests Against Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria for Depriving Human Rights Condemning them for Violating Treaty Clauses

[Reuters, London, 2nd] The British government issued protest notes to Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria today, pointing out that they violated the clauses in the treaties regarding respect for human rights and demanding that they take remedial action immediately. The notes cited the imprisonment of Hungarian Cardinal Mindszenty, the arrest of Hungarian Christian Bishop Ordass, the imprisonment of Romanian Peasant Party leader Maniu, and the execution of Bulgarian opposition leader Petkov as examples to prove that the three countries systematically suppressed the freedom of speech, association, and religious activity of the parliamentary opposition. At the same time, U.S. envoys in the three countries took similar action this morning. Diplomatic circles believe that unless Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria provide satisfactory answers to Britain and the U.S., Britain and the U.S. will invoke the treaty clauses as signatories to the treaty and convene a meeting of the chief diplomatic representatives of Britain, the U.S., and the Soviet Union stationed in each of these countries to discuss the actions that should be taken.

### Small Car Can Be Folded Into a Suitcase Shape

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 1st] The press here today visited a very small car that can be folded. With the help of a kind of hinge, the car can be folded to a width of only 70 cm, so the car only needs a very small garage. The car is equipped with a one-and-a-half horsepower engine and can carry two people.

### Republicans Demand Cuts in Aid to Europe The U.S. Senate Rejects It Hoffman Vigorously Argues to Maintain the Original Plan

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] After overcoming efforts to cut the cost of the European Recovery Program, the Senate prepared on the 2nd to quickly pass the second phase of the Marshall Plan, totaling $5.58 billion. However, although the Senate's approval of extending aid to Europe seemed inevitable, the recovery plan would be temporarily shelved, because the authority to allocate funds for the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) would end at midnight on the 2nd, and the House would not submit this bill until next week.

The Senate may be forced to make a final decision on extending aid to Europe by early next week. Democratic leader Lucas called for the Senate to hold an emergency weekend meeting to accelerate the final decision. The Senate rejected Republican leader Wherry's proposal to reduce the aid to Europe requested by the government by 15% over the next 15 months by a vote of 68 to 14, thanks to the strong force exerted by the bipartisan foreign policy. The Senate also rejected Republican leaders Taft and Russell's amendment to reduce aid to Europe by $543 million (about 10% of the total) by a vote of 54 to 23. Before the vote, a letter of appeal from ECA Administrator Hoffman to the Senate was read. In the letter, Hoffman stated that cutting aid to Europe would make the industrial recovery plan a "relief plan." In the end, Hoffman hinted that he might resign if the ECA's funds were significantly reduced. At the same time, Hoffman told the press that, for practical reasons, the ECA would temporarily cease operations this weekend, but the ECA supplies currently being shipped were ordered three months ago, so a slight delay in Congress's action on the ECA's authorization bill would not interrupt the recovery supplies being shipped to Europe.

### Industrial Association Holds Board Meeting Yesterday: Discussing Steps for North-South Trade; Representatives Sent to Beijing, including Pan Shihao, Report on the Petition Process; Decision to Telegraph Mao Zedong, Li Shucheng, et al., Hoping for Support and Facilitation

The Municipal Industrial Association held a board of directors and supervisors meeting yesterday afternoon to hear reports from the seven representatives, including Liu Hongsheng, Hu Xiyuan, and Pan Shihao, who returned from petitioning the government regarding North-South trade issues. Jin Runxiang chaired the meeting. First, Representative Pan Shihao reported on the petitioning process in Beijing, stating briefly: Those met in Beijing included Premier of the Executive Yuan He Yingqin, Minister of Finance Liu Gongyun, and Minister of Economic Affairs Sun Yueqi. The representatives presented three points to the leaders: (1) Shanghai's industrial production is the leading in the country, but sales to North China account for a significant portion, and a portion of raw materials also comes from North China, so the exchange of North-South assets is extremely important. (2) Tianjin has already established trade with Hong Kong. Although the area has raw materials shipped to Hong Kong, they cannot be transferred to Shanghai, so raw materials and supplies from North China should be directly shipped to Shanghai via Tianjin. (3) If industrial products cannot be sold to the North, it will cause factories to shut down, and the livelihoods of millions of workers will become a problem. Premier He and Ministers Liu and Sun expressed sympathy for the situation of the industrial sector and attached great importance to the exchange of materials, but considering that the peace talks were still in the initial stages, they needed to wait for some results before further discussion. The representatives believed that if the peace talks succeed, North-South trade is inevitable, but currently, it must proceed simultaneously with the peace talks to achieve the exchange of materials as soon as possible, so that industrial products can be sold to the North early. Premier He asked the representatives to wait for a week before further discussion, to observe the outcome of the peace talks in Peiping. The representatives returned to Shanghai to report. Later, Hu Xiyuan and others supplemented the report. After discussion, three resolutions were made: (1) Telegraph Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party, requesting support for the exchange of North-South materials. (2) Telegraph Li Shucheng and others in the North China business community, hoping that they would facilitate the matter. (3) A. Issues such as the methods of selling industrial products to the North will be studied by the Transportation and Sales Research Subcommittee. B. The types and trademarks of industrial products sold to the North will be investigated immediately by the Technical Committee.

Another report: Yesterday, Liu Gongyun, the Governor of the Central Bank, specifically notified Du Yuesheng, the Chairman of the Industrial Association, by telephone regarding the North-South material exchange issue, requesting the appointment of representatives to meet at the Central Bank to discuss relevant issues.

### Three Groups Jointly Telegraph the Communist Side: Requesting a Cessation of Military Action; Any Dispute Can Be Resolved at the Peace Talks

The National Shipping Industry Association, the Industrial Association, and three other organizations, in light of the fact that the Nationalists and Communists have begun their peace talks but cannon fire continues on the northern bank of the Yangtze River, and in order to protect the safety of navigation, yesterday (the 2nd) jointly telegraphed the Chinese Communist Party, requesting a cessation of all military actions to facilitate peace talks. The original text is as follows: Respected Mr. Mao Zedong of Peiping, We note that war destroys transportation, hinders construction, and is cursed by all people. For more than ten years, industry, commerce, and shipping have suffered greatly from the ravages of war, and we deeply regret this. Now that peace talks have begun, looking north to Yanling, we are filled with joy. However, although the Nationalist army has been retreating and has long ceased fighting, the Communist army north of the Yangtze River is still frequently mobilized and is fiercely attacking Anqing, Yizheng, and other places, actively preparing to cross the river. This not only hinders peace talks but also endangers the safety of shipping on the Yangtze River. The impact of this situation will inevitably plunge production into despair and halt shipping, causing thousands of people in industry, commerce, and shipping to suffer from hunger and unemployment, which causes us great anxiety. We believe that in this day and age, any dispute between the two sides can be openly discussed and a comprehensive and thorough solution can be sought at the peace talks. We specifically telegraph you, earnestly requesting you to immediately order the troops north of the Yangtze River to cease all military actions to maintain the safety of shipping and facilitate the progress of the peace talks. We respectfully submit this telegram, hoping for your consideration. National Shipping Industry Association, Shanghai Industrial Association, Shanghai Shipping Industry Guild, respectfully.

### Tangshan Vessel Arrives in Shanghai from Qinhuangdao: Carrying Over Six Thousand Tons of Coal; Yongxing and Taian Expected to Arrive Today and Tomorrow

### Rice Market Transactions: Futures Trading Prohibited

Yesterday, the North-South rice market experienced an unprecedented price surge. The price of white rice for next-day futures trading (today is Sunday; with the Tomb Sweeping Festival on the 4th and 5th, the market is closed, adding three days of interest) reached 160,000 yuan per shi. Director Cao of the Social Affairs Bureau paid close attention to this issue and immediately ordered that futures trading be prohibited in the market to avoid stimulating other commodity prices. Therefore, the price of cash transactions on the same day in the market was only around 120,000 yuan per shi. The Social Affairs Bureau also scheduled a meeting with the Rice Merchants Association and the heads of the North-South markets on the afternoon of the 5th to discuss ways to stabilize prices.

### Families of Detained Lixin Teachers and Students: Renewed Request for Release

After thirty-one teachers and students from Lixin Accounting School, including Huangpu and Han Ziliang, were arrested in late October last year, four of them have been released on bail, but twenty-seven are still in detention. The families of those arrested petitioned the Municipal Government yesterday morning, stating that their family members have been detained for five months without being sentenced. On April 1st, it was reported that the Executive Yuan had passed a resolution that all undecided political prisoners should be released unconditionally, which provides a legal basis. Therefore, they requested the Municipal Government to forward their request to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to release the arrested teachers and students as soon as possible. Commissioner Ding of the Municipal Government received them and promised to forward the request.

### "Sea Fox" Iron Barge Drifts Away: China Merchants Bureau Sends Vessel to Search

[Report from Our Newspaper] On March 29th, the China Merchants Bureau's Min 105 tugboat was towing two iron barges, "Sea Fox" and "Sea Dog," fully loaded with timber from the Supplies Bureau, to Kaohsiung. Unexpectedly, when sailing to the sea off Wenzhou at 27.40 degrees north latitude and 122 degrees east longitude, the weather suddenly changed, with strong winds and high waves. The towline of the "Sea Fox" broke, and it went missing immediately. Yesterday, the Bureau sent the Min 316 vessel to the site of the incident to search for it. It is reported that there were no personnel on board the iron barge.

### Import-Export Guild Discusses: Appendices Proposed by the Industrial Association

Since the Industrial Association tentatively drafted appendices for imported goods, sending them to the Import Control Commission for reference and publishing them in newspapers to solicit opinions from the business community, it is now known that the Municipal Import-Export Guild believes that these appendices are closely related to the import-export industry. They convened a meeting on the 1st, attended by over twenty people, including An Shi and Hua Hongtao, who expressed many opinions. They generally agreed that the appendices proposed by the Industrial Association still had room for improvement. The main points are summarized as follows: (1) The appendices should only divide goods into two categories: goods permitted for import and goods prohibited for import (including those from other ports). It is difficult to accurately estimate the quantities. If restrictions are based solely on the needs of Shanghai, it will inevitably lead to uneven surpluses and shortages. Therefore, restrictions on imported goods should be based on tariff rates. (3) Since the new plan adopts import-export linkage and open import with self-provided foreign exchange, the restrictions on the qualifications of importers should be immediately lifted. (4) A circular will be sent to all members to solicit opinions on the two categories of goods, restricted imports and prohibited imports, proposed by the Industrial Association for further study. The representatives present at the meeting believed that the current trade regulations have been delayed for too long, leaving merchants without direction, and the administrative authorities should be urged to draft and publish them quickly.

### Civil Aviation Plane Returns to Shanghai from Peiping: Bringing the First Batch of Postal Items from the Communist Area

These letters, mostly mailed in Peiping on March 1st and April 1st, were fully distributed by the Shanghai Post Office on the morning of the 2nd. This is the first large batch of airmail from the Communist area to arrive in Shanghai, and it is hoped that North-South postal delivery will become normal in the future.

### Families of the Victims of the Jiangya Steamer Disaster: Symposium Resolves Three Points

The families of the victims of the Jiangya steamer disaster held a symposium yesterday and resolved: (1) To request the China Merchants Bureau to announce the true cause of the ship's accident and the survey report of the Japanese sailors. (2) To urge the District Attorney's Office to quickly open a court investigation into the intentional homicide case against shipowner Shen Dacai. (3) Compensation issues for the families of the victims. The above resolutions will be forwarded by the families to the Jiangya Disaster Association to be presented to the China Merchants Bureau and the court.

### Statement by the Taiping Relief Committee: Appeal to Employees of China United Company

After employees of the China United Company appealed to all sectors of society to protect their jobs and distributed various leaflets, the Taiping Steamer Disaster Relief Committee invited reporters from various newspapers to a press conference at 3 PM on April 2nd and issued the following statement: (1) The company and representatives of the bereaved families had an agreement with witnesses to provide temporary relief to the bereaved families. However, the distribution of rice was stopped after only half of it was given. The bereaved families in Shanghai and Taiwan, due to lack of livelihood, have had cases of suicide by hanging, swallowing gold, and jumping into the sea. (2) No efforts have been made to salvage the bodies and belongings to date. (3) The seizure of the Anlian steamer by the Taiwan court and the provisional disposition of the Hualian steamer by the Shanghai court were both handled in accordance with the law. The claim for compensation for the victims is currently in litigation. The employees of the company have exaggerated the situation, which contains an attempt to influence the fair trial of the court and confuse public opinion. (4) The representatives of the bereaved families in Taiwan and Shanghai have suffered from broken families and extremely difficult lives. For the sake of the living and to seek justice for the dead, they assist the company in handling the aftermath without complaint. The company only provides the staff with a normal daily living, without any excessive enjoyment. However, the company's entire staff of over a hundred people gathered to insult the representatives and interfered with their freedom. Representative Luo Jiping had his clothes torn and suffered physical injuries. Now, the company's employees claim that the representatives insulted them, which is a complete reversal of right and wrong, intending to sow discord and division.

### Social Affairs Bureau Mediates Two Labor Disputes in Cotton Mills Yesterday: Advance Wages Maintained; Request for Rice Subsidy Denied; Existing Practices Should Be Maintained, New Practices Should Not Be Introduced

[Report from Our Newspaper] Director Shen of the Labor Affairs Office of the Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives of labor and management in the municipal cotton spinning industry yesterday to mediate labor disputes. The cotton spinning industry has had a practice of borrowing eleven days' wages in advance each month. Recently, due to poor production and sales, the management requested to abolish this practice. In addition, the workers of Zhongfang requested the factory to subsidize three dou of rice per month. The Social Affairs Bureau mediated these two issues as follows: The existing practice of eleven days' advance wages will be maintained; the request for rice subsidies will be rejected as there is no precedent. The principle of mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau for such cases is to maintain the status quo; existing practices should not be abolished casually, and new practices should not be approved rashly, to avoid causing more disputes between labor and management.

### Disputes Over Wage Payments in Promissory Notes: Two Cases Resolved Through Mediation

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Labor Affairs Office of the Social Affairs Bureau mediated two disputes yesterday regarding factories paying wages with promissory notes: (1) When paying wages, Lun Chang Yarn Factory paid 20% in cash and 80% in promissory notes. (2) When paying wages, China Watch Factory paid 35,000 yuan in cash and 25,000 yuan in promissory notes. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, both cases were resolved. The principle of mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau is that factories should pay wages mostly in cash and only a small amount in promissory notes.

### Statement by the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the recent practice of factories and businesses issuing promissory notes when paying wages due to the cash shortage, which has led to disputes over discounts, Director Cao of the Social Affairs Bureau issued a statement yesterday, saying that the promissory notes issued by national banks and bureaus have the same effect as cash and should not be subject to discounts. The Social Affairs Bureau has requested the Municipal Government to inform the municipal military and police agencies to suppress the practice of discounting promissory notes. As for small, less credible banks, the financial authorities should also restrict the amount of promissory notes they issue to avoid undermining the credibility of promissory notes due to bounced checks, which would cause the public to distrust promissory notes.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Line Sailboat: Unprecedentedly Few Passengers

Affected by fare increases, the number of passengers on both road transport vehicles has gradually decreased. At the same time, the number of passengers on the Shanghai-Ningbo line sailboats is similarly sparse. The Jiangjing sailboat of the China Merchants Bureau once sold only 300 passenger tickets, which is unprecedented. Now, during the recruitment period before and after the Qingming Festival, there is such a scene, and in the summer months of May and June, the number of passengers will be even scarcer.

### Dayu Steamer Sends Out Three SOS Signals: Lives on Board in Imminent Danger

The Dayu steamer, belonging to the Dada Datong Joint Office in Shanghai, set sail from Shanghai to Hankou on March 27. On March 30, when sailing upstream past Wuhu, it was suddenly shot at. Yesterday, the Joint Office received the third SOS telegram from the steamer, stating that the coal and rice on board were about to run out, and the lives of everyone on board were in imminent danger, urgently requesting the authorities to send a warship to escort them to Guichi. Upon receiving the above telegram, the Joint Office immediately telegraphed Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Gui Yongqing in Nanjing, requesting him to send a warship for protection. Commander-in-Chief Gui immediately took measures to rescue them.

### Many Still Owe Shopping Certificates for Last Month's Rice Ration: Civilian Affairs Office is Thoroughly Investigating

Since March, the Civilian Affairs Office has stipulated that citizens must submit Shopping Certificate No. 7 printed on their ID cards when receiving rice ration cards. This has been very effective in preventing fraudulent claims and re-issuance of rice ration cards. According to statistics from the Certificate Issuance Section of the Office, more than 600,000 unused rice ration cards were returned in March. The Office has dispatched staff to various district offices to check in detail whether the number of Shopping Certificate No. 7 turned in matches the number of rice ration cards actually issued. It is now known that 38 Shopping Certificate No. 7 are owed by the 7th Bao of Yangshupu District, 41 are owed by the 13th Bao, and 35 are owed by the 26th Bao. Penglai and Yimiao Districts have also not submitted all certificates. In particular, over 2,000 certificates are missing in the North Sichuan District, and the Office is reporting this to the authorities for thorough investigation. If any fraudulent activities are found, the Bureau of Civil Affairs will be involved in the investigation according to the law. This month, Shopping Certificate No. 19 is required for rice ration card exchange, and this will be strictly enforced. Citizens are urged to pay close attention.

### University Professors and Students: Petition Representatives Return to Shanghai Yesterday; Three Months of Back Pay Will Be Issued Immediately, This Month's Salary Will Be Issued Next Week

[Report from Our Newspaper] Representatives of professors and students from national universities and colleges who went to Beijing to petition have returned to Shanghai yesterday. The professor representatives visited Acting President Li, Minister Hang, and others in Beijing.

The government stipulated that the salaries for March in the Beijing-Shanghai area will be issued at 2,700 times the civil service index, which can be supplemented within one or two days. One week later, salaries for April will be issued at 2,700 times first, and will then be supplemented after the civil service index for April is announced. In addition, academic research funding may be increased. The professors' association still insists on its demands and will discuss them further at a meeting within the day. Yesterday morning, the presidents and professor representatives of Jiao Tong University, Tongji University, Fudan University, Jinan University, and Shanghai Business School visited President Liu of the Central Bank to urge the early disbursement of the supplementary amount for March and the advance payment for April.

### Full Public Funding: Difficult to Achieve Currently

### China Textile Company Sued for Delay in Delivery: Court Rules Against the Plaintiff

[Report from Our Newspaper] On September 6 of last year, Wufuxingji Dyeing and Weaving Factory was allocated one piece of 40-count Baoguang yarn from China Textile Company, paying a yarn price of 880 gold yuan, and one piece of 42-count Lanfeng yarn, paying 1,050 gold yuan. On September 21, it received warehouse receipts No. 25911 of Sha Zi from China Textile Factory No. 8 and No. 36172 of Sha Zi from China Textile Factory No. 19. It attempted to pick up the goods from each factory, but was refused due to being overdue. Wufu Factory sent a letter of negotiation on September 27, requesting an extension of the pickup date or a refund of the payment. It subsequently received a reply instructing it to first obtain proof from the receiving bank and then submit it for verification. After Wufu Factory obtained the proof and sent it, the China Textile authorities took away the original two warehouse receipts and only replied after more than a month: The date of issuance of the bill of lading was September 9. Why did your factory wait until September 21 to pick it up from the receiving bank? Although proven, it was overdue. According to regulations, it should be purchased back. Wufu Factory believed that it had suffered significant losses due to the delay of China Textile Company and requested the District Court to order delivery of the goods. However, the defendant, China Textile Company, argued that Wufu Factory paid to the Bank of China on September 7, but delayed until September 21 to pick up the bill of lading from the National Bank, while the National Bank received the delivery order submitted by the company as early as September 9, preparing for the plaintiff to pick it up. Therefore, the delay was not caused by the bank but by the plaintiff itself, which is obvious. After the District Court's judgment: The plaintiff's claim and request for provisional execution are both rejected.

### Three Robbers in the Hartung Road Resistance to Arrest Case Confess: Mastermind and Victim Related - Uncle Abducts Nephew - Gang Up to Rob - "Little Savage" on the Run and Wanted

[Report from Our Newspaper] At No. 35, Lane 240, Tung Jen Road (i.e., Hartung Road), the residence of Shui Ming-te, owner of the Shui Mei Da Shirt Shop, seven robbers broke in at 8:30 PM on the 24th of last month, wielding fast-firing machine guns and other weapons. During the robbery, they engaged in a struggle with police officers from the Jing'an Temple Branch. Three suspects, Dai You-san, Li Wu, and Chen Heng-biao, were apprehended, as detailed in this newspaper. It has now been learned that, after being taken into custody, Li confessed that the inside information for the robbery of the Shui residence was provided by Fan Zu-gen (nickname "Little Savage"), the younger brother of Shui Fan Yue-ying, the mistress of the Shui residence, who initiated the plan. The firearms were supplied by another accomplice, Liu Xiao Guozi. On the evening in question, at around 7:00 PM, they first gathered in a small teahouse near Wuzhen Road Bridge in Zhabei, then hired a Xiang Sheng car to drive to the robbery. At the time, Fan Zu-gen was wearing dark glasses and had a handkerchief covering his mouth. After the robbery, he was the first to rush out. Shortly after the police arrived, Fan Zu-gen was the first to open fire with a fast/slow-firing gun to resist arrest, firing a total of five or six shots. He also confessed the details of Fan Zu-gen's involvement in a prior incident of kidnapping his nephew. He stated that on February 27th, at around 4:00 PM, Shui Wen-bin, the son of Shui Ming-de, was reading a book at a small bookstall near the entrance of the lane. Fan Zu-gen arrived with his friend, known as A Wang, and, on the pretext of going to see a train, took the child to the North Railway Station.

He was taken to Suzhou and hidden. After Shui's wife, Fan Yue-ying, lost her son, she asked Zu-gen to find him. At the time, he readily agreed, falsely claiming to have many friends outside and that he would definitely have a way. On March 1st, Fan went to his sister's residence, falsely claiming to have some clues and that he needed a large gold bar to redeem his nephew. His sister was unable to provide this, and Fan left in disappointment. The next day, Yue-ying scraped together four gold rings and 130,000 yuan in cash and sent them to her mother's house at No. 29, Cheng Lai Lane, Emei Road, to be handed over to Zu-gen to redeem the ransom. Unexpectedly, when Zu-gen took the money and went out, he told his mother that Wen-bin was in Suzhou and

gave her a note to pass on to his sister. It read: "Your nephew is currently in a shanty in shed No. 49, Baocheng Bridge, Suzhou." Several days later, Yue-ying, not seeing her son return, hurried to her mother's house to inquire. Her mother explained that the gold rings and other items had been taken by Zu-gen and that his whereabouts were now unknown, but that he had left a note before leaving. After reading the note, the woman realized that her beloved son was in Suzhou. On the same day, the mother and daughter took a car to Suzhou and met A Wang, who was known to have taken the hostage. After questioning him, he said that the child had been handed over to him by Zu-gen to be taken to Suzhou. Thereupon, the mother and daughter went to the address, and they found Wen-bin and brought him back. Based on the above confession, Squad Leader Yu Ding ordered Patrol Officer Meng Rui-sheng to lead police officers Zheng Ji-wen, Xia Yong-chao, Lu Chang-jiang, and Yang Zhen-zhong to summon the mother, Fan Liu-shi, to the bureau for questioning, which confirmed the facts. The robbers, Dai You-san, and others, further confessed to having committed

two other robberies: (1) At 9:00 PM on February 8th, at the He Xing Tea Garden on Xinjiang Road, Zhabei, they robbed nine gold rings, two pairs of earrings, and a woolen blanket. (2) At 7:00 PM on March 11th, at the home of Zhang Xu-shi at No. 169 Hengtong Road, Zhabei, they robbed three gold rings. The branch bureau has now completed the investigation and will submit the case to the Garrison Headquarters for further action this morning. A wanted notice has been issued to arrest the fugitive mastermind, Fan Zu-gen, for severe punishment.

### Seducing a Neighbor's Young Wife and Then Falsely Accusing Her Husband of Extortion

Leather merchants Wu Yu-jin and Qin Xiu-da agreed to go to the Chang Ning Theatre on Chang Ning Road on the night of December 28th last year. They met Xian Jin-mei, the wife of their neighbor Zhuang Fu-gen. Wu and others, seeing that Xian was young and beautiful, went up to her to strike up a conversation. As a result, Qin lured her to the Yi Ding Hotel, where they had illicit relations for one night. Afterwards, Qin, fearing that her husband would discover the matter, had a far-fetched idea. He preemptively falsely accused Xian's husband, Zhuang Fu-gen, of extorting eighty dan of white rice from him. Wu Yu-jin also gave false testimony in the case. However, the police station eventually learned the truth and transferred Qin to the District Procuratorate for questioning. The prosecutor filed public charges against Qin for obstruction of freedom and false accusation. The case was initially heard in the District Court, and the court ordered a change of date to allow time for the case to be further investigated.

### National Products Factories Association - Telegram Requesting Suppression of High-Interest Loans - Advisable to Implement Low-Interest Industrial Loans as Proactive Measure

The Shanghai National Products Factories Association recently sent a telegram to relevant ministries and commissions requesting the speedy suppression of usurious loans to maintain their survival. The original telegram is as follows: (Omitted above) We believe that the foundation of a nation lies in its economy, and the lifeblood of the economy lies in production. The prosperity or decline of production depends on the development of national industry as its main factor. At present, China's economy is exhausted, and there is suffering both above and below, and the situation is critical, and it is difficult to reorganize. Looking at the reasons, there is more than one, but the one that restricts the life of national goods factories the most is the unprecedentedly high interest rate, which is a serious threat, and it is difficult to get back to breathing. Now that our government is making every effort to reform and preside over major plans, and has pointed out that saving the economic crisis is the guiding principle of its policies, the whole country is looking forward to it. The association is located in Shanghai, the first economic zone in the country, and is the group of national goods factories. Having witnessed the pressing crisis of various member factories, it has to appeal to the upper levels and seek salvation. In recent years, the difficulties of industry mentioned are nothing more than the lack of raw materials, the increasing daily expenses, the excessive cost, and the heavy taxes. All of these are the general state, but none of them are as high as the usurious

Deep and serious pain. Factories producing national goods rely on the financial industry for turnover. Looking at the advanced countries with developed industries, loan interest rates are generally low. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the legal annual interest rate was only 2%, and the deadline was even longer. Each factory could barely maintain itself because the interest rate was low and the prices were high. In comparison, even if sales were ordinary, there was still a surplus to be made. However, the recent facts are very different. The average market interest rate is 60% to 70% per diem. Borrowers have to bear the corresponding interest after eight or nine days. Using this interest rate speed to calculate costs, prices can rise to seven or eight times in a month. If the funds are tight, the daily demolition rate can even be as high as 100 or 150 yuan, then the cost burden is even more difficult to count. In addition, the expenses are huge, production is reduced, purchasing power is weak,

Sales channels are narrowing. If we want to maintain the material and finished products, we cannot bear the burden of high-interest loans. If we sell them at a discount, the income we receive will not be enough to compensate for the original capital for reproduction. Under such multiple exploitations and without any restrictions, I am afraid that in less than two months, seven out of ten factories in Shanghai will declare business suspension and bankruptcy, the number of unemployed workers will suddenly increase, there will be a lack of means to earn a living, and the national economy will collapse. In the near future, looking to the future, we will shiver. Now, in order to prevent problems before they occur, we plan to ask the authorities to provide relief as soon as possible. The passive strategy should be to issue a clear order to strictly limit and suppress high-interest loans, and the active strategy should be low-interest industrial loans, and to simplify loan procedures, so as to maintain the survival of the national industry. If so, it can stabilize the economic situation in the city, and be in line with the purpose of saving the national economic crisis. An urgent enquiry, I beg you to adopt and implement it, and I cannot express my joy. Chairman of the Shanghai National Products Factories Association, Hu Boxiang, respectfully kowtows. Mao Dongyin.

### Zhejiang's Treasure - Fluorite Mine

— Our Reporter Huang Xingtian

[Report from Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 1st] More than 20 years ago, a Mr. He Zhihan in Wuyi first discovered that the local emerald ore had important value in modern industry, so he started mining it and made a considerable profit. In the 13th year of the Republic of China, a Mr. Li Wanpeng in Xiangshan also mined this ore at the southern foot of Wusi Mountain and transported it to Japan for sale. This emerald ore is fluorite, a flux used in iron smelting (originally named Fluorite, or Fluorspar, i.e., calcium fluoride CaF2). This often transparent, colorful cubic crystal with a glass-like luster, in addition to accounting for about 82 percent of the total production as an iron smelting flux, the rest is used to manufacture hydrofluoric acid and colored glass, and can also be used to manufacture enamel. Pure and transparent, it can also be carved into various utensils and ornaments. In terms of

In terms of the quality of fluorite, Zhejiang surpasses South Korea and holds the authoritative position in Asia. Although the fluorite quality is also good in other domestic areas such as Linxiang in Hunan, Jiaoxian in Shandong, Jiaocheng in Shanxi, and Longhua in Rehe, the output is far less abundant than in Zhejiang. In Zhejiang, according to surveys, there are more than 50 counties, including Jinhua, Yiwu, Xinchang, Shengxian, Xiangshan, and Wuyi. Among them, Wuyi has the most reserves, and Xiangshan has the most convenient transportation. The mining of fluorite in Zhejiang was very prosperous before the September 18th Incident. There were as many as 18 counties where merchants and people obtained mining rights. The annual output was mostly over 10,000 tons. Because the main sales target of fluorite was Japan, the output gradually decreased after the September 18th Incident until the active phenomenon was restored in the 23rd year. After the Anti-Japanese War, Wuyi and Jinhua fell one after another. The enemy puppet China Mining Company mined it in a big way and built narrow-gauge railways to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway or the seaport for transportation. Hundreds of thousands of tons of fluorite were stolen and mined. After the victory, all the enemy-left mines, houses, calcium carbide, and remaining fluorite were taken over by the Central Trust Bureau's Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau. However, for the past three years, they have never been repaired or utilized, and the houses and machines have been completely damaged. The remaining ore has also gradually weathered, and it has been stolen and sold from time to time. Even the roadbeds and bridges belonging to transportation have been dug up by residents. The modern mines and transportation that the enemy puppets opened up with the blood and sweat of the local people during the occupation period with cruel exploitation methods can not only not be used by the government as the production basis for economic recovery, but even the price of the blood and sweat of those people—the mined ore—is ignored and allowed to weather. The Enemy Property Administration Bureau neither handles nor manages this precious heavy industrial raw material, and allows it to be stolen, transported, destroyed, and allowed to be transported, destroyed, and this kind of intention really makes the people feel cold.

After Chen Yi took charge of Zhejiang, he began to pay attention to this natural treasure and the existing artificial foundation. In order to revive the economy of Zhejiang, he was determined to

To develop fluorite mines and sell fluorite abroad to earn foreign exchange, buy rails back to the country, and build a network of narrow-gauge railways in important economic areas of the province as a blood vessel for building new Zhejiang. This plan is to start with the two major mining areas of Wuyi, which has the most output, and Xiangshan, which has the most convenient transportation. The Wuyi mining area is located about 45 kilometers southeast of Jinhua. The large mining area is located in the basin near the suburbs of Wuyi County, covering an area of about 123 square kilometers; the small mining area is located in Jiangwandong, 15 kilometers away from the city, covering an area of about 25 square kilometers. The total reserves in the county are about 2,000,000 tons. When the enemy puppet China Mining Company managed it, narrow-gauge railways were built; the products in the urban area were first transported to Huangjiaotan, Wuyi Port, on the upper reaches of the Qiantang River, eight miles away from the city, and then transported by rafts to Jinhua and then transferred to Hangzhou. The enemy puppets built two power plants and 80 houses in the mining area. Now, even the narrow-gauge railway has been completely destroyed. Within the territory of Wuyi, merchants have already obtained mining rights for Wuweilong 2.73 hectares; Changshe Mountain, Renxing Mountain 14.46 hectares, Jiangwandong 20.08 hectares, Shilonggang 8.60 hectares, totaling 45.87 hectares and 20 mm. Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial Government Construction Department surveyed five large mining areas and one small mining area, with a total area of 63 acres and 20 mm, and has applied to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval to set up mining rights.

The Xiangshan mining area is located in Xikou Township, Maoyang Village, and Wusi Mountain, 25.5 kilometers away from the city, about 50 miles away from Shipu Town. The reserves were originally estimated at only 250,000 tons. It is reported that the enemy China Mining Company has stolen 200,000 tons, and the remaining reserves are no less than 250,000 tons. The fluorite left by the enemy is also about 30,000 tons. The total area of the mining rights obtained by merchants is 1.25 hectares and 9 mm. The enemy once built a narrow-gauge railway of 7.8 mm and a highway of about 3 to 4 kilometers from the mining area to Xiehan Ferry. Now the roadbed is intact, but the bridges and culverts have been destroyed. Now the provincial government plans to restore the existing narrow-gauge railway, so the fluorite in the Maoyang Village mining area can be transported to Xieqian Ferry by narrow-gauge railway, loaded onto small steamships, cross Yuejingyang to Shipu Town, and then transferred to large steamships and transported to Shanghai for export. In Mr. Chen Gongqia's plan, he also wants to extend the railway from Xieqian Ferry to Shipu and develop Xiangshan as a seaport, so it can be directly exported, and transportation will be more convenient at that time. The Zhejiang Provincial Government made a first

The first transaction made by Zhejiang Provincial Government through Shao Hongshu, the economic representative stationed in Japan, with the Japanese government was to exchange 1,700 tons of fluorite (US$40 per ton) for steel rails of equal value. The fluorite required will also be transported from the Xiangshan mining area.

After the reorganization of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the new Provincial Chairman Zhou Yan and Construction Director Liu Jimin are both soldiers, but they are also very enthusiastic about developing fluorite mines and have retained Director Li of the competent department to continue to actively carry out the work. Therefore, political and personnel changes have not affected the exploitation of this treasure, but the political system has always hindered the active exploitation of this plan. Because the two fluorite mines in Wuyi and Xiangshan and the fluorite left behind were taken over by the Enemy Property Administration Bureau as enemy property. However, for the past three years since the restoration, the Enemy Property Administration Bureau has neither handled nor managed them, and has tolerated the fluorite being stolen and weathered, and the houses and roadbeds being destroyed. They believe that there is no profit to be made, so they have abandoned them and have not even sent a single person to guard them. They only sold more than 1,000 tons of existing fluorite to merchants; and that merchant sold more than the quota without any hindrance and made a lot of money. However, when the Zhejiang Provincial Government was determined to exploit fluorite, it sent several official letters requesting its transfer, but they were all lost in the sea. The former Director of the Construction Department, Gong Peicheng, personally rushed to Shanghai to negotiate, and only received a reply saying that it had been transferred to the Resource Committee for management. Even so, relevant personnel of the provincial government still received private letters saying that if the Zhejiang Provincial Government wanted the property rights, they could still purchase them at a price; the public servant who was enthusiastic about construction looked at it and did not know whether to laugh or cry. Under such a situation of three parties fighting for power, the Zhejiang Provincial Council righteously supported the provincial government and passed a motion at the recent general meeting: "It has been found that the fluorite mined by the enemy puppets in Wuyi, Yiwu, Xiangshan and other counties during the war has not been shipped out. According to the Construction Department, there are more than 50,000 tons. Exchanging it for steel rails used for narrow-gauge railways can pave hundreds of kilometers of narrow-gauge railways. Therefore, it is recommended that the provincial government should continue to sell or exchange rails for these items according to the previous resolution, and complete the narrow-gauge railway plan to achieve the purpose of utilizing resources. It has also been heard that this fluorite has been sold to the Resource Committee by the Enemy Property Administration Bureau at a low price and belongs to it. We should strive for it according to reason. When the enemy puppets stole the mining, the people in the counties near the mining area suffered great damage to manpower and materials, so the price they obtained must be allocated to local construction in the province in order to be fair and impartial." The Zhejiang Provincial Government's exploitation of fluorite is not to make up for the provincial finances, but to focus on the local economic construction of Zhejiang, and the enemy's fluorite should be used as the price for their blood and sweat, and to seek welfare for them. Moreover, whether it is the central government or the local government, they should respect public opinion and serve the people. There is no reason to fight for power and profits and hinder the promotion of economic construction. Zhejiang Fluorite.

The prospect is promising. According to experts, the fluorite quality in Wuyi is above 90%, and the composition in Xiangshan is also above 80%. The former American Jiangnan Company sent a German engineer to conduct on-site testing, and the results were the same. Therefore, Zhejiang fluorite is not only far better than that produced in South Korea, but can also compete with Canada in the international market. Now, the fluorite that Japan urgently needs is supplied by South Korea. Although the United States has abundant domestic production, it still needs to be supplied from Canada. It is estimated that Zhejiang's fluorite production and sales can sell at least 50,000 tons to Japan and the United States each year, so there can be a profit of US$1 million to US$1.5 million per year. Using this valuable foreign exchange to build Zhejiang, the future of new Zhejiang will be easier to realize. We look forward to the smooth exploitation of fluorite mines and the rapid arrival of a prosperous new Zhejiang!

### The Northeastern Edge of Zhejiang (Part Two)

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Chu Yusheng

Exploring Factors of Tranquility

The reporter has investigated the factors contributing to this peace. First, of course, it is the local affluence, being a true land of fish and rice, where the people can all be well-fed and clothed. Therefore, the people are peaceful and the customs are kind, and they will not take risks unless they are on the verge of desperation. The land issue is not serious because landlords grant perpetual tenancy rights to tenant farmers. Tax reduction of 25% and rent reduction are both reducing the rights of landlords. Therefore, the landlord class is gradually declining. Second, because Commissioner Yu Shuluan has been in charge of this area for ten years, due to Yu's own integrity and his hard work, the general public has respect and awe for Yu. Therefore, local people are quite harmonious, without factional divisions, and no one wants to establish their own independent banner, recruit soldiers, and buy horses to seek the development of their own power. Third, because there are no factions in the area, everyone cooperates and plans for the local area. The self-defense organization is still relatively strict, and the self-defense force is also quite strong. For example, Changxing County has more than 2,000 rifles and more than 70 machine guns. The people have accurate marksmanship and can shoot flying sparrows with rifles.

Protecting the Territory and Pacifying the People First

Commissioner Yu Shuluan once said to the reporter, "We local officials only know how to protect the territory and pacify the people. If anyone wants to harm the people or bully the people, then we must eliminate the violence for the people. In recent months, the Communist army has not come to disrupt the territory, but there are many disturbances from wandering troops, scattered soldiers, and stragglers posing as wounded. Recently, many unidentified teams from Jiangsu have flowed into the territory, with a somewhat distorted development of reverting to guerrilla warfare as in wartime. Their discipline is extremely poor, and the people complain bitterly about them. Therefore, the territory is gradually feeling uneasy. For example, in the current year, in just March, it has been reported that there have been eight robbery cases in Wuxing, five in Jiaxing, six in Jiashan, two each in Changxing and Pinghu, and one each in Deqing and Haiyan, totaling twenty-two cases. Obviously, there is great unrest. If there is no way to improve the people's lives, then it may increase those who take risks. The future is truly worrying."

### Jiangyin Fisherman Catches: A Grey Bird with Two Heads and Four Eyes, Able to Swim

It has two heads and four eyes, its feathers are grey, and it can swim in the water. The bird has now been purchased by the local elementary school principal with funds and sent to the Education Bureau in the city for display as animal research material.

### Micro News

Chongming

[Report from This Newspaper] The military authorities of this county have decided to build more than 70 bunkers in order to consolidate local security. The construction costs will be borne by the contractors, and construction will begin soon.

Jiading

[Report from This Newspaper] The previous inspection of the public training in this county by Deputy Commander Sun of the Provincial Security Headquarters showed poor results, and the activities were ordered to be strengthened immediately. On the 29th of last month, Commander Zhang of the Third Joint Defense Zone personally inspected and found that no outposts had been established in various places. The deputy captain Huang, who was in charge of public training, was immediately dismissed and sent to the province for punishment in order to rectify discipline.

Jiaxing

[Report from This Newspaper] In recent days, soldiers of unknown units have been cutting down trees and catching chickens in nearby villages, and the villagers dare to be angry but dare not speak. Although reports have been made to the authorities, no method of restraint has been shown. Also, in the Shuangqiao area, groups of three to five soldiers of this type go to the town every day to forcibly purchase fresh meat, chickens, and ducks, and at night they forcibly lodge in people's homes, or even demand cash, and the townspeople cannot bear the disturbance.

### Liu Wenhui and the Political Situation in Sichuan and Xikang

— This Newspaper Reporter Zhou Xueduan

[Special Dispatch from Chengdu of This Newspaper, dated the 30th] The recent brewing of turmoil in the political situation in Sichuan and Xikang has attracted attention at home and abroad. Liu Wenhui, the protagonist of the Sichuan and Xikang political situation who has roamed the southwest political arena for more than 20 years, has thus attracted more general attention. Xikang is a mysterious region in western China. Liu Wenhui has governed Kang for more than 20 years. To uncover the inside story of Xikang and explore the context of the political situation in Sichuan and Xikang, one must have a thorough understanding of Liu Wenhui.

Life History - Diplomatic Manoeuvring

Mentioning Liu Wenhui easily makes one think of Feng Yuxiang, the famous "turncoat" Christian general, whose life history is full of diplomatic manoeuvring. Among the senior generals of the Sichuan Army today, Liu's qualifications are relatively shallow, and he is only in his fifties. He rose to prominence thanks to the recommendation of his fellow villager Chen Hongfan from Dayi. During the revolutionary Northern Expedition, he was transferred from the Sichuan Post-War Relief Office to the commander of the 24th Army. He defeated his fellow villager Liu Chengxun, and his career was smooth, rising to the throne of Chairman of Sichuan Province and concurrently serving as the Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan-Xikang Border Defense. In 1933, the Second Liu Civil War broke out, and Liu Xiang led his troops west. In the Battle of Kunhe, Liu Wenhui's entire army was defeated and fled in a panic into Xikang. The army was sharply reduced from more than 100 regiments to more than 10 regiments. From then on, Liu temporarily bid farewell to the political stage of Sichuan. But then came two opportunities to reverse his misfortune. One was that the Communist army entered Sichuan in 1935, and the civil war in Sichuan stopped, giving Liu a chance to breathe. The second was that the War of Resistance broke out in 1937, and the National Government moved west to Chongqing. Xikang was preparing to establish a province due to its important strategic location. In 1938, the Central Government transferred the six counties of the Sichuan Ya area and the eight counties of the Ning area to Xikang. The following year, the provincial government was established, and Liu Wenhui began to formally control Xikang. During the War of Resistance, the Sichuan soldiers went to Sichuan to fight the war, but Liu Wenhui stayed in Xikang alone and did not take a single step out of the Kui Gate. Zhang Qun concurrently managed the chairmanship in order to settle the local area and tried his best to win over Liu. Therefore, from the War of Resistance to the victory, Liu always steadily served as the leader of Xikang, smoothly managing his strength in order to make a comeback.

Governing Kang by Kang People - Prelude to Success

The people of Kang have long had a definite evaluation of Liu Wenhui's merits and demerits in governing Kang, which need not be repeated here. But there is no doubt that since the establishment of Xikang Province, the people of Kang have generally been dissatisfied with Liu. Therefore, Xikang has been brewing a "Kang people governing Kang" movement for more than ten years, such as the famous "Nona Incident" and "Ganzi Incident," which are examples of this. The largest scale was the "Ya Area Incident" in 1946. The cause of the incident was that the "rioters" of Tianquan, Lushan, Baoxing, and Rongjing were dissatisfied with the provincial government's "public opium" policy and rose up to "resist eradication." In less than ten days, it spread throughout the entire territory, and the counties of Tianquan and Lushan were captured. At the same time, upper-level ambitious people used the opportunity to universally launch a "Down with Liu" movement. From Sichuan to Shanghai, a huge wave was set off, making Liu's control feel threatened and shaken. Therefore, Liu spared no expense to put down the rebellion, including large-scale monetary activities, threats and inducements, partial reorganization of the provincial government, and using official positions as bait. He finally exhausted all his efforts, and the rebellion gradually subsided. As a result of the reorganization of the provincial government, the little-known Tao Liangsheng became the Secretary-General, Chen Yaolun became the Director of the Land and Food Department, and Zhang Tanru became the Director of the Education Department. This was a prelude to the success of "Kang people governing Kang," showing that Liu Wenhui's power to control Xikang was beginning to decline!

Military and Political Cadres - Surrounding Him

The military and political cadres surrounding Liu Wenhui naturally play a considerable role in the current political situation in Sichuan and Xikang. Zhang Shaoyang, the acting chairman of the Xikang Provincial Government and concurrently the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, is from Dechang, Xikang. He was Liu's classmate at Baoding and has assisted Liu for decades. He is mediocre and ordinary. Li Wanhua, the Director of the Department of Finance, is Liu's economic "chief steward" and has considerable power in the financial circles of Sichuan and Xikang. Zhang Yuanru, the Director of the Education Department, was originally the Director of the Political Department of the 24th Army and rose to prominence through flattery. Zhang Jingxi, the Director of the Department of Construction and a former National Senator, enjoys a good reputation in Xikang. Wang Mengzhou, the Director of the Department of Social Affairs, is directly appointed by the Central Government. Wang Jingyu, the Director of the Department of Security, is one of the leaders of the veteran faction of the Kang Army. These people are all Liu's political cadres. In terms of military affairs, Liu's basic troops are the 24th Army, and Liu concurrently serves as the commander. It is entirely a force of his own followers, and the real power is entirely in the hands of the "young military men of Xikang." The division commanders include Liu's son-in-law Wu Peiying, Liu's nephews Liu Yuanxuan and Liu Yuancong. From generals to cadres, they are all members of the Liu family. This can be said to be the most feudal and outdated old-fashioned feudal warlord force in the "National Army." The main reason for the Ya Area Incident was that the relationship between the army and the people was too bad, and Liu's indulgence of his children and generals is also to blame. The general public opinion is that the military and political cadres surrounding Liu Wenhui are indeed not as good at military affairs as they are at writing.

The national situation has changed drastically, and war and peace are facing a crossroads. Xikang has become an important strategic town for western national defense. How to stabilize Xikang and build Xikang are the most difficult and most urgent issues that Liu Wenhui needs to solve. In light of the current situation in the country and in Sichuan and Xikang, and in light of Liu's current situation, the only way is to work hard to build Xikang and stabilize the rear. This is the key to his success or failure in the future, and everything is waiting for his wise decision.

### Rice Prices Soar Uncontrollably: Top Grade White Rice and Thin Rice Reach 160,000

The rice price surge is like a mania, spiraling out of control. The Social Affairs Bureau has sent personnel to the market to suppress it, and the head of the Grain Department is personally sitting in charge, but yesterday was Saturday, and due to the two-day interest, the merchants raised prices. Also, because the market is closed for three days during the spring holiday, rice shops replenished in advance, resulting in very brisk sales and soaring prices. Prices were tightest early in the day and softened towards the close. In the North Market, top grade white rice closed at 160,000, special grade rice at 165,000, and in the South Market, top grade white rice was 155,000 and thin rice was 160,000, each rising by about 40,000. The market quotes still show the previous day's original price, but note the cash price. However, cash transactions within the market are extremely rare. Arrivals at the two markets totaled 6,933 shi.

Cooking Oil

Prices soared sharply. Because rice prices had risen sharply previously, people were very nervous, and merchants tried their best to raise prices. The surge was fierce and unusual. Soybean oil closed at 770,000 and 760,000, up 160,000. Jitou's raw oil was 840,000, also up 160,000. Rapeseed oil was 660,000 and 650,000, all rising sharply by more than 25%. Soybean cake rose by 6,000 to 7,000, with few transactions.

Flour

Rose violently, because of the three-day Spring Festival holiday. At this time of unstable and uncertain conditions, people are largely optimistic. Because rice prices soared, merchants raised prices even more forcefully. At the opening, the prices of all brands of flour broke through five levels, rising sharply by about 25%. Later, rice prices eased slightly, and people became tired, and the price fell back by 1,000 yuan. Laoche closed at 53,000 yuan, and Bingchuan traded at 51,500 yuan.

Grains

The rising trend is still strong, but because of tight money, buying interest is very weak, so transactions are not booming. Soybeans rose sharply by 20%. Hankou Chendou was priced as high as 120,000, and Pinghu Doudou reached 140,000. Raw peanuts broke the 300,000 mark. Sesame merchants raised prices, and the market was deadlocked. Only milk sesame opened at 240,000. Rice and red beans rose together by 20%, and mung beans did not open.

### Spot Transactions in the Rice Market Still Do Not Exceed 120,000 Yuan

[Report from This Newspaper] Recently, prices have soared, and the rise in rice prices is particularly strong. Yesterday, the retail price per shi had already broken through the 160,000 yuan mark. This reporter visited Cao Peizi, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, yesterday and asked what measures the bureau has taken in response to the sharp rise in rice prices. According to Director Cao, he convened a meeting of the heads of the North and South rice markets on the 1st of this month, instructing them to pay attention to the people's food problem and not to seek exorbitant profits, and to bear the blame for leading the rise in prices. They assured the Social Affairs Bureau that spot transactions would not exceed 120,000 yuan per shi yesterday. When the rice market opened yesterday, futures trading took place, and next-day transactions had to bear three days of interest (Saturday, Sunday, and the Tomb Sweeping Festival on the 4th), and rice prices soared to 160,000 yuan. After hearing this news, he immediately ordered the North and South markets to stop futures trading and hoped that the market leaders would fulfill their promises. It is reported that spot transactions yesterday still did not exceed 120,000 yuan. As for check transactions, it is a commercial custom, and the rumor that he ordered a ban is inaccurate. The Social Affairs Bureau will convene a meeting on the 4th with the Public Opinion Survey Office and the Emergency Grain Purchase and Storage Committee to jointly discuss measures to suppress rice prices.

According to Wang Jiashu, Director of the First Division of the Security Bureau, the reasons for the sharp rise in rice prices are: (1) cash panic, and rice payments cannot be remitted to the production areas; (2) the Tomb Sweeping Festival is approaching, and few villagers are transporting rice to Shanghai, resulting in an insufficient supply; (3) interest rates are too high; (4) eager buyers.

### Second Redemption of Gold Bonds: Lottery Held in Shanghai Yesterday

The second redemption lottery for the first series of short-term gold bonds of the Republic of China, Year 38, was held on the fourth floor of the China Trust Bureau. A total of five winning numbers were drawn: 03, 15, 47, 74, and 86. The Central Bank and its entrusted banks will handle the exchange procedures starting from April 4th.

### Banking and Financial Industry Imposes Rigid Regulations on Business and Exchange Hours

[Report from This Newspaper] The banking, financial, and trust industries association has now re-regulated banking hours and bill exchange hours and will probably implement them starting on the 9th. The newly established banking hours are from 9:00 to 11:30 AM and from 1:30 to 3:00 PM. The deadline for banks to accept customer deposits is set at 11:30 AM. The time for sending exchange bills to the clearinghouse is before 2:00 PM. The exchange time is 4:00 PM. The time for sending returned checks to the clearinghouse is before 8:00 PM. The time for distributing returned checks is 9:00 PM. The deadline for replenishing exchange account shortfalls is before 10:00 PM. According to a spokesman for the Banking Association, the above times are all rigidly regulated and will be strictly enforced. Those who send bills and exchange them after the deadline will be settled on the second day. No accommodations can be made for missing documents.

### Forged Bank Notes Discovered

The Financial Control Bureau is Investigating Thoroughly

[Report from This Newspaper] The Financial Control Bureau is paying close attention to the recent proliferation of bank notes on the market and hopes that merchants and the public will refuse to accept bank notes issued by banks in violation of regulations (such as those with a fixed amount on the face or a rubber stamp for the responsible person's signature). In addition, the Financial Control Bureau is also investigating the rumored discovery of forged bank notes of the China National Products Bank on the market.

### Gold Prices Firm, Silver Dollars Lucrative

[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, the trend of gold was firm. In the morning, because 5% of the gold bonds from the second series were redeemed, 50,000 taels of funds flowed out, and people were reassured. The opening price was 1,025,000. Midway, because the Central Bank did not sell, and retail sales were strong, with active sales from silver shops and gold shops, prices soared to 1,051,000. Towards the close, because there were more long positions, the price fell slightly to close at 1,047,000.

In the afternoon, the market was closed due to the weekend. The interbank clearing price was 1,038,000, an increase of 83,000 from the previous day, equivalent to an interest rate of about 8.5%.

Off-Market

[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, the off-market was stable in the morning, opening at 1,020,000 and 1,030,000, rising to 1,043,000 and 1,048,000, and closing at 1,042,000 and 1,047,000 at noon. In the afternoon, because prices in other ports were reported to have risen, and with 10 billion Taiwan dollars released, the money market gradually became more relaxed, and secret interest rates fell to 60 to 70 yuan. People were optimistic, and same-day delivery rose to 1,100,000 and 1,150,000. The initial price for next-day delivery was 1,245,000 and 1,255,000. The final price in the evening rose to 1,270,000 and 1,280,000, also an increase of 4,000 from the previous day.

Ornamental Gold

[Report from This Newspaper] The price of ornamental gold in silver shops was stable, still quoted at 1,010,000 and 1,100,000 in the morning, and unchanged in the afternoon. However, ornamental silver rose to 11,000 and 13,000, up 1,000. The price of money changers rose in the morning from 1,030,000 and 1,070,000 to 1,050,000 and 1,100,000 in the afternoon.

US Dollars

[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, the off-market price of US dollars was strong because import and export companies and banks were actively seeking them. The opening price was 21,500 and 22,000, rising to 22,000 and 22,500, and falling to 21,000 and 21,500. The noon closing price was 21,800 and 22,500. Transactions were sparse in the afternoon. The asking price for next-day delivery rose to 25,000 and 26,000, an increase of 200.

Silver Dollars

[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, silver dollar arbitrage became more active again. Because prices in other ports gradually approached those in this city, both parties felt it was worthwhile. About 800,000 to 900,000 were arbitrated from South China and West China. Street trading was initially flat and then firm. In the morning, the price of big heads was 17,500 and 18,500. In the afternoon, it was rumored that the Central Bank was absorbing large quantities, and people were optimistic. The price of big heads rose all the way from 18,000 and 19,000 to 19,000 and 20,000. The price of small heads was 15,500 and 16,500. The price of dragon and eagle coins was 12,000 and 13,000. Money changers and securities companies engaged in cross-market trading of big heads. The initial price for same-day check transactions was 19,000 and 20,000, rising to 22,000 and 24,000 in the afternoon, an increase of 2,000 from the previous day.

### Yarn Prices Rise Sharply

Cotton yarn rose sharply across the board, mainly because of the two-day interest rate, which led to merchants raising prices sharply, but direct sales were still not very brisk. The opening price of 42 count blue phoenix yarn was 7,600,000 yuan. Under the hype from surface traders, the trend rose rapidly. The noon closing price was close to the 8,000,000 mark, at 7,900,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 980,000 yuan.

### Intense Struggle between Bulls and Bears: The Chinese Stock Market Flourishes

[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday was the weekend for Chinese stocks, and the struggle between bulls and bears was fierce. The market was stable in the first half, and a battle unfolded in the second half. Major players hyped the market, and retail investors panicked. The difference between the rise and fall of the market reached more than one yuan. Initially, due to tight overnight funds, the market interest rate rose to 1.2 yuan. The Yongsha discount rate also rose to 88 yuan and 93 yuan. With the double burden of interest, the market slowed down. The morning opened at a low price of 13 yuan. Short positions were covered, rising to 14 yuan. Then it was heard that the spot supply was exhausted, and yarn merchants continued to seek supplies, and securities merchants followed suit, once raising the price to 15.3 yuan. Later, it was heard that the Central Bank continued to sell gold, and people became flustered. The selling trend on the surface became evident, falling to 14.2 yuan, and finally rising again to the edge of 15 yuan. Around noon, the prices of goods outside the circle rose together, and merchants eagerly sought orders, with tight money. The market fell back again, finally closing at 14.4 yuan.

Among the small and medium-sized stocks, Meiya rose sharply after opening, and the noon closing price was stable. Jingfu rose to the limit. Xinguang was initially weak and then strong. The trends of Qinxing and Xinhe were healthy. Several other brands also rose to the limit, and miscellaneous brands were also lucrative.

In the later market, it was initially heard that the money market was slightly relaxed, and buying sentiment turned strong. All stocks rose together. Yongsha immediately reached the 16.8 yuan limit after opening. Afterwards, it fell slightly by 0.2 yuan, and then reached the limit again at the close.

The off-market trading price of Yongsha initially opened at 15.5 yuan, rose to 16.35 yuan in the middle, and then fell back to 15.75 yuan at the close. Others such as Xinguang, Meiya, and Jingfu all rose by about 20%. The total turnover of the entire market was 4.9263 billion shares.

The gold bond market was quiet, with few transactions. The opening price was 655,000 for selling and 640,000 for buying. The final price rose to 650,000 with transactions, an increase of 60,000 from the previous.

Foreign stocks Yesterday was the weekend, and the interest burden was too heavy. All parties were eager to get rid of them. The initial opening was still flat, but because Chinese stocks were reported to be rising, people were encouraged. The noon closing price rebounded together. Yisha traded at 35,000 yuan and 36,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 5,000 yuan. British United traded at 37,000 yuan and 38,000 yuan, an increase of 11,500 yuan. Jardine Matheson traded at 115,000 and 120,000, a further increase of 5,000 yuan.

Rice Market Has Price Limits, Still Needs the Stick

Rice prices are shockingly high, even more shocking to think about!

Rice stocks are in the countryside, especially in Anhui and Jiangxi. The Yangtze River cannot be cut off, otherwise, the people of Shanghai will suffocate.

To stabilize the people's food supply, the Social Bureau has stepped in to control prices and reinstate price limits. Hopefully, they will redouble their efforts to ensure long-term stability.

Some say: Yesterday in the rice market, prices stabilized at 130,000 yuan from the day before's high, giving face to the Social Bureau. In reality, rice can only be bought with cash. However, rice market transactions usually use promissory notes. Now, with the cash shortage, no one will use cash anymore. Therefore, this price limit of 130,000 yuan per picul exists only in name. As for buying with promissory notes, a premium must be added. Yesterday, using Monday's notes required adding two days' interest, so it would cost no less than 160,000 to 170,000 yuan. That's how prices supposedly aren't rising.

I believe that as long as the price limit of 130,000 yuan per picul can be maintained, then despite the premium or interest, it can still be controlled to some extent. The problem is the fear that the limits won't hold. And even if they do hold, there's the fear of not being able to buy rice. The people of Shanghai are all exceptionally rich in this kind of experience.

The day before yesterday, there were rumors of dozens of firms faltering. Yesterday's report said it was an April Fool's joke, which is a bit harmful. But yesterday, news came that the faltering firms are still faltering, just blamed on April Fool's Day.

I heard that several firms were supported by a certain major firm yesterday, so they luckily overcame the crisis. But there are still a few that haven't been settled.

At a time when promissory notes are flying around, firms cannot afford to falter. If even a slight disturbance causes a few to collapse, it could immediately affect the entire situation.

Because every firm issues promissory notes, which are not cashed anyway, it's impossible to verify their actual value. In particular, the circulation of promissory notes in the market, overnight in people's pockets, is fine when the market is stable. But when the market is volatile, it's extremely dangerous. One wrong move, and it will all fall on people's heads.

Issuing too many promissory notes is like firms writing bad checks. Customers don't deposit them in the bank, so the bad checks aren't exposed. If the promissory notes are deposited, the bank sends them to the clearinghouse, and the truth becomes clear.

Recently, many people who receive promissory notes don't deposit them. Many firms are already unstable, and if everyone deposits their promissory notes, then firms that issue too many will become even more unstable.

In the past two or three weeks, remittances from Taiwan have had a significant impact on the city's finances.

The Central Bank exhausts its efforts to withdraw funds, but as soon as remittances arrive from Taiwan, the Central Bank's efforts are completely undone.

This is the general perception, but it misunderstands the subtle intricacies.

The Central Bank throws out goods, which people say is withdrawing funds.

But when the Central Bank buys goods, it's actually releasing funds.

The so-called "overtly selling, covertly buying" shows that the buying must be covert. So, the talk of remittances from Taiwan is not unrelated to this covert buying.

Keeping Promissory Notes Overnight Is a Big Risk

### Shanghai Police Avenge Defeat, Ren Yu Suffers Unexpected Loss, Jian Le in C Group Has High Hopes of Winning Title

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Last night in the basketball league, the Shanghai Police Ren Yu Er Branch Youth Army had their second encounter. This was also Ren Yu's last match in Group A. Ren Yu, already secured as runner-up, was confident of winning against the Shanghai Police again last night. Unexpectedly, General Sun Guozheng was absent, morale was low, and the team lacked fighting spirit, leading to a complete collapse. The second half was even more uncontrollable. As a result, the Shanghai Police achieved a great victory, avenging their humiliation in the first round. The score was 55-36, a significant difference of 19 points. At halftime, it was 26-16, with Ren Yu already trailing by a considerable margin. The Shanghai Police had excellent shooting luck last night, with almost every shot hitting the mark. In the latter half of the second half, Ren Yu had completely disintegrated, and the Shanghai Police's empty back defense was easily penetrated, causing the situation to deteriorate rapidly. The Shanghai Police played with increasing energy, with Liang Yongbiao being particularly active. Fortunately for Ren Yu, Shen Pengju scored 21 points alone, holding up the situation somewhat. The closest score in the first half was 15-12, with Ren Yu trailing by three points. After that, the gap gradually widened, fluctuating between 12, 13, 15, and 16 points. Before the match, the women's team Li easily defeated the Li team, 35-14. In Group C of Group B, Jian Le defeated the American Meteorological Team, 53-31.

Ren Yu's players were Wu Xinyun, Xu Zhongji, Shen Pengju, Li Zhaohe, and Wang Huaiting. The Shanghai Police's players were Wang Bowen, He Zeng, Shi Jiuquan, Wang Rongsheng, and Fu Qixia.

After the two sides made contact, Shi Jiuquan of the Shanghai Police scored first after three minutes. He Zeng then scored another point. Shen Pengju of Ren Yu scored a free throw, making it 1-4. Yao Wenyi replaced Zhaohe, and the score returned to 7-3. Wang Bowen of the Shanghai Police scored a corner shot, and Jiuquan continued to score. Shen Pengju of Ren Yu made consecutive free throws, and the score gradually narrowed, 15-12, with Ren Yu trailing by only three points. Unexpectedly, Bowen and He Zeng of the Shanghai Police made free throws, and Qixia also scored under the basket. At halftime, the Shanghai Police still led 26-16.

In the second half, the Shanghai Police replaced Bowen with Liang Yongbiao. Liang scored repeatedly upon entering the court, showing considerable power. Pengju and Zhongji of Ren Yu struggled to fight back. Ren Yu's Zhuang Yirong replaced Huaiting, making it 33-20. Bowen of the Shanghai Police replaced Jiuquan, but Wang soon committed five fouls and was replaced by Shi again. Ren Yu also replaced Zhaohe with Huaiting. After this, Ren Yu's back defense was often empty, the outcome was decided, and they were continuously trampled upon by the Shanghai Police, ultimately losing 36-55.

Li Team Easily Defeats Li Team

The women's team took the stage first. After the start of the game, the free throws by Fan Yuying and Liang Miaoling of the Li team seemed a bit weak, and none of them scored. In five minutes, the two teams scored sporadically from free throws. Qian Youping of the Li team scored three points, changing the situation to 9-3. In the first quarter, it was 11-4. The two Qian sisters received assistance from Yao Silian, succeeding on both sides. In the second quarter, the Li team's forwards were quite "cold," and at halftime, the Li team had 20 points, while the Li team had 4 points. In the third quarter, Zhu Cuidi replaced Youping, Chen Wenyan served as a forward instead of Chuping, and Xu Huiru replaced Wenyan. Soon, Qian Lili replaced Chen Yuqin. The Li team's three back defenders stood together, giving the opposing side a chance to attack, resulting in a score of 29-11. In the final quarter, the Li team still used its most elite lineup, making it even more difficult for the Li team. As a result, the Li team easily defeated the Li team 35-14.

Jian Le Defeats American Meteorological Team

In Group C of Group B, the main force of the Jian Le team faced the American Meteorological Team. Initially, the score was tied at 5. Jian Le's Jin Kun and Zhang Xianlun attacked fiercely, while only Lao Xu and Maikao of the American Meteorological Team were relatively active. As a result, Jian Le took the lead all the way, with the score at halftime being 28-1.

In the second half, Le Lian scored four consecutive goals, adding eight points. The other side showed no movement, making it 44-26. Xuan Tong replaced Jin Kun. A bare-chested child from the American Meteorological Team took the stage, receiving cheers from the audience. In the end, Jian Le won 53-31. The hope of winning the title in this group is becoming increasingly strong for Jian Le.

### Main Battle of the Second Round, Qing Bai Faces Dragon Head Today

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The main battle in the second round of the football league, Qing Bai versus Dragon Head, has already been postponed once due to rain. It is scheduled to meet at Yiyuan at 3:00 PM today. However, due to the heavy rain all day yesterday, it is still uncertain whether this exciting game can be held as scheduled. Fans can call the football committee at 38683 before noon to inquire. If it can be held, the assigned referee will be He Chunhui, with line judges Chen Jixiang and Zhang Le. Ticket prices have been adjusted to 2,000 and 3,500 yuan. They will be sold at the city stadium starting at 1:00 PM.

Qing Bai recently had veteran players retire, and almost all of its players, except for Meng Yiliang, are new. However, their fighting strength has not been weakened as a result. They still maintain an undefeated record in Group A and are confident of winning the championship. However, after being eliminated in the Mayor's Cup due to underestimating their opponents, they will no longer be careless in the league. With a strong opponent ahead today, they will definitely show their full strength.

Dragon Head is the old partner of the Northeast Wind, with a Northern style, full of energy, bold and straightforward, and highly supported by fans. Unfortunately, the team has not been successful in the league and was eliminated in the first week of the Mayor's Cup. Facing Qing Bai again today is an opportunity to work hard and strengthen themselves.

### Shanghai Police Take Advantage of Victory, Face Hua Lian Again Tonight

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Tonight in the basketball league, the Shanghai Police, taking advantage of their victory over Ren Yu, will have their final battle in Group A of the league against the league champion Hua Lian. If they can defeat Hua Lian, they will have the same record as Ren Yu and share the runner-up position. Otherwise, they will be in third place. Hua Lian's victory or defeat has nothing to do with the championship, but in order to maintain their reputation, they will definitely not let up easily. They only won by nine points in the first round against the Shanghai Police. What will happen tonight remains to be seen after a fierce battle. In the women's group, the Green team will face Xing Hua for the first time, which should be exciting. The Green team did not lose in the first week; they forfeited the match. Tonight, there will be an additional friendly match: Huili will play a farewell match against the American Seamen, with the Seamen's strength not being strong and represented by the Qier teaching ship. Tickets are available in three types: 1,500, 3,000, and 5,500 yuan.

### Former Chinese Sports Referees Issue Honorary Certificates to Members

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The former Chinese Sports Referees Association, which served the sports community for more than ten years, with more than one hundred members all over the country, made great contributions to sports in our country. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was suspended due to the dispersal of its members. Now, in memory of the association, honorary certificates of membership service have been printed and are prepared to be distributed. It is hoped that the members of this and other provinces will inform Mr. Le Xiurong at No. 25 Xinhui Road, Jin Yuan Middle School, of the number of years they have served from the time of their admission until December 8, 1941, and specify what kind of sports.

Talking About the Sporting Spirit of the Li Team

The author always believes that the spirit of the Li team is valuable because the team has been established for three years now, and each session they participate in ends up being the bottom team. However, they do not show any resentment on the field, consistently fighting earnestly. Even when the score difference is too large, they still maintain that spirit. This should be the advantage of athletes. However, on the other hand, we are also disappointed with the team, which is that the degree of progress is too slow. The reason for this is nothing more than that they are young, have poor physical fitness, and practice less. These problems, as we see them today, are already changing, which is that their age is ultimately three years older than when they were established, and their physical fitness is also visibly strengthened. At the same time, experience is undoubtedly increased through more games, and they have also gained leading figures this year. It is said that there are two enthusiastic people, Mr. Chen and Mr. Li, who encourage them and invited Mr. Wen Mayouyu to be the manager and Wang Huaiting, a Ren Yu player, to be the manager. With the strengthening of these factors, their performance this year is indeed better than in the previous two sessions. Recently, it was also stipulated that they will practice at the stadium every Wednesday and Friday. Of course, if they can maintain their current spirit and continue to work hard, then this day next year, they will definitely impress everyone.

Regarding guidance, I think it is worth studying. Most of the current teams in Shanghai want to learn the highest-level techniques, such as using fake moves and blocking methods! Of course, to make a team exciting, these techniques are necessary, but you have to pay attention. You can't ask a child who can't run to jump. How is that possible? In other words, if the players' basic movements are not yet mastered, how can they learn further movements and even apply methods? Therefore, the method of guiding the little heroes of the Li team should focus on basic movements and neglect methods. I wonder what Huaiting thinks?

The unity of the young players is also worth mentioning. They have been these same players since the team was founded, except for Chen Wenyan, who went to the Li team this year. Chen Wenyan is, of course, the mainstay of the team's defense, but she was recruited by another team, which is a pity. This is a case of a weak team having a special talent who is scouted away, making it difficult for the weak team to progress and stand out. Apart from Miss Chen, there are still several old partners. I hope they will cooperate until the end and not be captured by other teams after achieving some success. If they cooperate, they will eventually be able to use their strengths to gain an advantage.

As for the team members, I am very familiar with them. They are entirely a student army from middle school. Yao Wenda, Fan Yuying, and Weng Zhengyun are top students at Xizhen Girls' High School. The Liang Miaoling and Miaozhen sisters are studying at Xin Jian Middle School. In terms of skills, Liang Miaoling is the most adorable forward, short and energetic, and not bad at shooting. As for the defense, Yao Wenda (sister of Yao Wenyi, a Ren Yu player) is the most agile. The Wang Jiahua and Wang Jiacui sisters, the former a defender and the latter a forward, are also quite good. The others are also very hardworking players.

Finally, the author feels that the Li team has one of the best gains, which is that although they lose every battle, they always have countless spectators who are the volunteer cheerleaders for the weak. This is not an easy gain as a bit of mental comfort during the battle because it cannot be obtained solely by being inferior in skills. You must have a good sporting spirit and consistently show it to win the inner sympathy of the audience. I hope the Li team will work hard with the support of the masses! I wish the Li team a bright future!

Li Team Lineup: From right to left (back row) Yao Wenda, Fan Yuying, Wang Jiacui, Wang Jiahua, (front row) Liang Miaozhen, Weng Xiayun, Liang Miaoling.

### Side Notes

— Qian Dacheng

In the small city where I live, seven or eight out of ten families have women making lace.

Some say: "Women have progressed; they no longer play mahjong all day and can actually earn a little bit of money."

Some say: "The income of women from poor families is enough to feed one person for a day."

People with a broader perspective are saying: "Lace merchants are exploiting the surplus labor of housewives."

Lace merchants say: "Distributing lace is to help poor women and can also earn a lot of foreign exchange."

As I have heard, "That is also a right and wrong, this is also a right and wrong." I prefer a humble argument. The eight years of the War of Resistance and the three years of the Civil War have been difficult enough for everyone. Men suffer, and women suffer even more—except for a small number of women, of course. Who doesn't want to enjoy a little leisure? Who is happy to spend all day holding a small thread, making decorative lace for foreigners? Hunger drives me, forcing people to this point. The country has no solution for unemployed men, let alone mentioning women's employment. Go back to the kitchen, but even a skilled woman can't cook without rice, and there is no chicken, duck, or fish to cook; cooking one or two meals of bitter rice doesn't take much time. The remaining labor is of course devalued and sold, and they are afraid that no one will buy it. Although lace merchants are suspected of exploiting women's surplus labor, they have put in a lot of effort and capital, which is still better than the zero-cost transactions of corrupt officials. Although they benefit themselves too much and benefit others too little, they still provide some benefits to others, and we don't need to be so harsh in demanding perfection from them. —I heard a few days ago that lace has stopped being distributed again, perhaps because the atmosphere of war by the river has become thicker again? As a result, the general public of poor women are living in fear all day long. From this, we can know that we should not sing high-pitched tunes.

It is sad that women make lace, but what about us men who write articles? An article fee is roughly equivalent to the wages for making a piece of lace. Moreover, it is not certain that it will be sold, and it is not as tough as the lace made by women. Even if every piece is sold, it can only be called "lace literature."

The "lace" that makes a rustling sound on the street is the real tough stuff. How great it would be if the wages of women's lace were rustling "lace"; the manuscript fees of men's "lace literature" were also rattling "lace."

Lace! Lace! Twentieth-century lace! This term, I am afraid, will not be clear to the scholars who edit the "Chinese Dictionary" in later generations.

### Fool and Others

— Fei Yu

There are four idioms in Persian that say:

A person who doesn't know this thing and doesn't know that he doesn't know this thing is a fool; avoid him.

A person who doesn't know this thing but knows that he doesn't know this thing is a child; educate him.

A person who knows this thing but doesn't know that he knows this thing is a sleeper; wake him up.

A person who knows this thing and knows that he knows this thing is a smart person; follow him.

A Cow That Understands Music

In the Ferihaca area of central Hungary, farmers are using music to help cows produce milk. Listening to music broadcast by wireless radio every evening can increase milk production by 10 to 15 percent. They also found that cows are only interested in certain types of music. Most of them like classical music, young cows like relaxing music, and old cows like jazz music.

Telephoto Camera

There are about 600 cameras for shooting the Bikini atomic bomb test, one of which is the world's largest telephoto camera. The machine weighs 200 pounds, the lens is 48 inches long, and can clearly photograph the second hand on a clock 8 inches in diameter from 1,500 feet away.

Turtle's Eyes

The color of animal eyes rarely differs by gender. However, the eyes of a species of turtle in Africa are different in color between males and females. The eyes of male turtles are red, while the eyes of female turtles are yellow.

### The Story of a Bank Draft

— Lacking Shells

The school sent someone to deliver a bank draft for 50,000 yuan—the amount of salary for this month supplemented according to the new multiplier.

Upon seeing that the bank draft wasn't crossed, I was overjoyed, because according to common knowledge: not crossed means it can be cashed. So I hurriedly rushed out the door, called a rickshaw to go to the bank to cash it, because the market would close tomorrow, and it was already past 2 p.m.

As a result, the bank clerk said, "It's not easy to cash." I stated a long explanation about why a bank draft that isn't crossed should be cashed, but he wouldn't listen. I lowered my head and walked back, because the only two 500-yuan bills I had were already given to the rickshaw "gentleman." Now I couldn't even afford the streetcar.

Therefore, I aimlessly noted on the 50,000-yuan salary line: "Minus rickshaw fare: 1,000 yuan."

I asked my neighbors if they had any ideas. They all said it could be used to buy things, but they couldn't give change. That, of course, wouldn't work for me. I need to use these 50,000 yuan to cover various expenses for a month.

But my wife said, "It's not a solution to just keep the bank draft at home, especially since we have to pay cash for vegetables, oil, and salt tomorrow. Besides, the currency is depreciating day and night; we can't keep it." After careful consideration, I suddenly became overjoyed again: I had an idea. I just saw someone use a bank draft to buy silver dollars, so if I had silver dollars, wouldn't I have cash? I rushed to Henan Road again, "Do you have 'big heads'? Will a bank draft work?" The silver dealer nodded, but said there would be a discount. This would of course be a disadvantage, but I thought, why bother running around for a 50,000-yuan bank draft? So I agreed: 10,000 yuan was used as 9,000 yuan. The 50,000-yuan bank draft could buy four "big heads" at a price of 112 each, and he even gave me the preferential treatment of returning 520 yuan in change. This, I was already very satisfied with.

However, the silver dollars still had to be exchanged for cash in order to pay the landlord and feed myself. Therefore, I had to beg the silver dealer again: "Do you want 'big heads'? The silver market is rising, so I can sell them at a price of 111." Although I lost another 800 yuan, I thought this market price proved that I hadn't made a foolish deal.

I originally wanted to walk home again, but then I thought, why should a person be such a slave to money? I was already tired enough from running around today. So I boarded the streetcar, using 400 yuan of the 520 yuan the silver dealer had given me in change to ride the first-class streetcar home. As a "petty government employee" who could still ride the first-class streetcar, I felt quite content.

After returning home, I calculated again and made a few more notes under the salary amount:

Minus streetcar fare: 400 yuan;

Minus bank draft discount: 5,000 yuan;

Minus the loss from buying and selling silver dollars: 800 yuan;

Minus today's interest, calculated at 6 jiao, which should be 3,000 yuan;

Including the rickshaw fare of 1,000 yuan, a total of 10,200 yuan should be deducted. Therefore, the actual salary received from 50,000 yuan is 39,800 yuan.

### Inscribing on Lingxu's Painting of Pandas

— Shi Shufan

Yesterday, I accompanied Sanmu to Wanqingzhai, where the host showed us his recent painting of pandas. The brushwork was simple and the meaning complete, the ink dripping wet, which was particularly pleasing. This subject had never been fully explored by predecessors. Seeing it now suddenly felt quite new and different, yet it was still executed according to the laws and rules of the national painting style, truly matching the hidden intent of Shi Ke's crazy monk paintings. I composed an inscription on the spot. I heard that the host plans to recruit students to teach painting. In the future, his students will be influenced by him, and he will surely bring a unique and splendid color to the art world.

The four walls are bleak and empty, the vast blue sky is reflected.

Six times a day, the wind of heroism arises, connecting to the realm of primordial chaos.

Alas, the painter paints, capturing the fierceness of a fierce tiger.

Mice are merely mice, how can they restrain their running.

With a full belly, they must eventually stiffen, thus reaching ultimate stillness.

### "The Third Blow"

— Wang Ce

—An Outstanding War Film

Soviet war films and Hollywood films differ greatly in temperament. Hollywood war films often "show off" too much, to the detriment of the theme's development. In the Soviet film "The Third Blow," the director captured the composure and strategy of the Soviet soldiers and their commanders, how they divided and encircled troops on the vast battlefield, and finally defeated the German defense.

On the battlefields of crossing rivers, climbing mountains, charging, and fighting, the director and cinematographer's efforts are visible everywhere.

Just looking at one aerial shot, one can see that the use of the camera has reached an outstanding level. The opening scene is the German-defended Kherim Fortress. The camera pans down from the aerial plane, and as it reaches the ground, the camera pans down from above the barbed wire, all the way into the trench. Then, it unfolds the German defense works, giving people a fresh and lively feeling.

The second is in the atmosphere. In the spring of 1944, the Soviet army was preparing to attack under the overall operational plan of the General Staff. The battlefield was very quiet, wildflowers were blooming everywhere, and the weather was warm. The young Soviet soldiers couldn't bear to rush into the enemy's position. Those scenes full of sentimentality were handled extremely cleanly and neatly. The silence of the earth before the advance, and the soldiers singing and marching shoulder to shoulder in the flowers after occupying Gureim, all show the film's superior tone.

This film shows how the German army suffered repeated defeats from the Siege of Leningrad to the Crimean campaign, shaking their confidence in swallowing the Soviet Union and the European continent. The actors' performances are refined, and the portrayal of Stalin is extremely lifelike. If the whole film could be connected by one or two characters, the dramatic effect would be even greater.
