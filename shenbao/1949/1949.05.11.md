### National Army Counter-Attacks and Recovers Liuhe; Communist Army Invades Jiashan's Northern Suburbs but is Repelled; Situation in Jiujiang Remains Unchanged, West Bank of Hukou Still Firmly Defended

[Central News Agency, This City] Military source at 11:00 AM on the 10th: Regarding Liuhe Township, our army launched a counter-offensive last night (9th), achieving a great victory. Order in the township has returned to normal. The results of the battle are being tallied, and the bandits in the area are fleeing northwest.

[Central News Agency, This City] According to a military dispatch released at 10:00 PM on May 10th: (1) After Liuhe was recovered by our army on the 10th, the bandits immediately fled northwest. There are no longer any traces of bandits south of Liuhe and east of Liudu Bridge. (2) A certain unit of our garrison in Jiading dispatched strong forces on the morning of the 10th to conduct a forceful search in the Tangtang area. They encountered a bandit reconnaissance company, resulting in a fierce battle for two hours, after which the bandits were unable to withstand the assault and fled north. (3) At dawn on the 10th, over a thousand plainclothes bandits, coming from Xitang north of Jiashan, attempted to harass Jiashan's northern suburbs. The garrison immediately met them with a head-on attack. After a fierce battle of two hours, the bandits retreated. Furthermore, west of Jiashan, we are still in a stalemate with a portion of the 85th Division of the Communist 29th Army. (4) Approximately 1,500 bandits from the 252nd Regiment of the 84th Division of the Communist 28th Army are entrenched in Jiaxing city, with over 600 bandits occupying the West Barracks. (5) On the 9th, over 400 bandits from Suzhou, poorly equipped, attempted to harass the Jiaozhi Township and Chenmu Township area. (6) According to people arriving from Wuxi: After Wuxi was invaded by the bandits, it was reorganized as a city, with Gu Feng appointed as mayor and Xie Kedong as deputy secretary of the municipal committee. On April 28th, the Communist military control commission convened a meeting with over one hundred representatives from public and private factories, forcing the factories to resume work and restore production immediately. However, because the Communist side provides each worker with only one *sheng* of rice per day in wages and food, making it impossible to make a living, many workers have fled elsewhere to seek a livelihood. (7) According to refugees fleeing from Changshu: After Suzhou fell into the hands of the bandits, they actively searched and plundered food from the people, forcibly requisitioned vehicles and boats, and a large number of civilian laborers, making it difficult for the people to survive.

[Central News Agency, This City] Military source at 10:00 AM on the 10th: (1) In recent days, our small units have continuously launched attacks, achieving brilliant victories and high morale. People from various places have offered condolences and assistance, with both the military and the people holding firm to a belief in certain victory. (2) At noon on the 9th, a unit of our army attacked the intersection of the railway and highway west of Kunshan, killing over 200 bandits. (3) On the 9th, over a thousand bandits advanced towards the Dongxinmu Bridge in Taicang. After an hour of fierce fighting, over 200 bandits were killed, and the bandits, unable to withstand the assault, retreated.

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 10th] Military news: (1) The situation in Jiujiang remains unchanged today, and the west bank of Hukou is still controlled and defended by the National Army. (2) External communications from Linchuan were temporarily interrupted yesterday afternoon, but long-distance telephone communications from Nancheng County remain open. (3) Shangbu in Xian County changed hands. (4) Nanchang Garrison Commander Hu Su has gone to Zhangshu to take command.

### Air Force Conducts Search and Bombing

[This Newspaper] In addition to supporting the National Army troops on the outskirts of Greater Shanghai today, the Air Force also conducted search and bombing operations deep behind the Communist army's supply lines. West of Nanjing, in the Dangtu River, they destroyed a 1,000-ton Communist motorized vessel. In Wuxing and Shaoxing, they destroyed a total of thirteen trucks in the Communist army's motorcade. At the Baxi Port in Jiangyin, they sank one hundred of the three hundred wooden boats used by the Communist army to cross the river from the south. Over four hundred Communist soldiers and dozens of tons of military supplies on board were also sunk.

### Central China Strategic Deployment is Sound; Battle to Defend Wuhan Begins; Curfew Advanced by Two Hours Every Evening

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 10th] "The long-awaited battle to defend Wuhan officially commenced yesterday morning at Lianglukou, 30 kilometers north of Hankou. Approximately 600 soldiers from Lin Biao's Communist force encountered the defending troops, resulting in a battle lasting one hour, with over 100 bandits killed. Near noon, the bandits reinforced with over 1,000 additional soldiers, and the battle shifted to the line of Hengshan Lijia Gang, continuing fiercely into the night.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 10th] The 10th was the second day of the battle to defend Wuhan. At 1:00 AM, over 1,000 bandits from Lin Biao's force, taking advantage of poor visibility at night, attacked our Fengheshan position on the outskirts of Hankou, while also feigning attacks on Lijia Gang and Putuan Temple, attempting to encircle Fengheshan. Another unit, using eight civilian boats from Huanghualao, attempted to secretly cross the river to Dalijia Dun, but were discovered by our garrison. Three boats were sunk. Commander Lu Daoyuan, upon receiving the report, ordered the garrison to flank and counter-attack Fengheshan from both sides. The battle continued until dawn, at which point the bandits were unable to withstand the assault and fled to Xujiamiao, Huangjiafan, Huanghualao, and other places. At noon, they again attempted to secretly cross the river to Sandao Qiao north of Chenjiaji, and our army immediately went to sweep them out. By 10:00 PM, they were still confronting our army in the Xiekou Xujiamiao area.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 10th] Lately, unfounded rumors have been circulating in Wuhan, causing considerable unease. To clarify the military situation near Wuhan, this reporter visited a responsible official at the Central China Military and Political Headquarters to inquire about the truth. He was told that the Communist troops on the Pinghan front have been gradually moving south. The southward movement of the troops under our Third Army Corps to Wuhan is purely to complete the strategic deployment. The Wuhan city defense works have been completed and are very strong. The entire Central China strategic defense is solid, and if the Communists invade, they will be met with a significant blow. The purpose of evacuating residents and non-combat personnel, as well as military supplies, is to reduce unnecessary losses due to the war. Furthermore, water transport on the Yangtze River from Hankou and above, and the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, are still open. Hankou to Jiujiang is also unobstructed. The claim that water and land transportation are blocked is entirely unfounded.

[This Newspaper, Hankou, 10th] The wartime atmosphere in Wuhan is becoming increasingly intense. The Garrison Command has stipulated that, starting from the evening of the 10th, the curfew will be advanced by two hours, from 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM the following morning.

### Front Line in Jimo is Quiet; Communist Army Has No Activity

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 10th] The front line in Jimo is quiet. After suffering a disastrous defeat, the Communist army has no activity. Our strong navy continues to send ships to patrol the sea west of the city to monitor the activities of the Communist army on Xuejia Island. Currently, the two sides are facing each other in the Zhangjiawan area, without any large-scale contact. Furthermore, wounded National Army soldiers defending Qingdao have been transported to hospitals in the city for treatment. Commander An Qi of the 11th Pacification District and labor groups from all sectors visited them today to offer condolences.

### Fuel Sources Difficult in Nanjing; Water and Electricity Only Supplied to Government Offices

[This Newspaper] According to a businessman who recently fled from Nanjing to Shanghai: Due to the decline in currency value, the emergence of a black market, and the lack of fuel, soldiers riding trains or attending theaters without tickets, the Communist Nanjing Military Control Commission recently issued a public notice stating: (1) One hundred Hua Zhong currency notes are equivalent to one Renminbi. Citizens should use this ratio uniformly and must not refuse to accept it or establish a black market exchange rate. (2) Due to difficulties in obtaining fuel, Nanjing's water and electricity can only be supplied to government offices first. All government offices should pay close attention to conservation and must not waste resources. (3) It has been found that "a small number" of personnel from our army are buying train tickets or entering entertainment venues without following the prescribed procedures. The people are encouraged to report such incidents at any time, and all units should strictly prohibit their personnel from going out without reason.

### Hunan Province Allocates Military Grain

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 10th] Due to the urgent need for military supplies, the Hunan Provincial Government has decided to allocate grain from wealthy households in the counties. A total of 49 counties and cities, including Changsha, Hengyang, and Xiangxiang, will allocate 1.3 *dou* of grain for every *yuan* of land tax paid, totaling 1.5 million *shi* of grain. This allocation must be completed within this month.

### Hundreds of Mutinous Soldiers Occupy Wenzhou; Southern Zhejiang Militia Groups Go to Encircle and Suppress

[This Newspaper] It has been learned that Wenzhou was occupied on the 8th by several hundred mutinous soldiers from the recruitment commissioner Ye Fang's New Fifth Army unit. The Southern Zhejiang Security Militia has gone to encircle and suppress them.

### A Few Prominent Figures in Wuhan Plotting Insurrection; Secretly Organizing a Maintenance Committee; Garrison Command Admonishes and Prevents, Otherwise Severe Punishment Will Be Inflicted

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 10th] According to a responsible official of the Wuhan Garrison Command, a few prominent figures in Wuhan have been secretly meeting in a certain venue and in their private residences, brewing a local peace movement and organizing a so-called "Wuhan Public Order Maintenance Committee," hoping to come forward to contact the Communists in the event of an emergency in Wuhan. When that failed, they turned to covert activities, promoting ×× as the person in charge of the Hubei Maintenance Committee and ×× as the person in charge of the Hankou Maintenance Committee. They also planned to delay the shortfall in the Central China region's military supplies as much as possible, increasing the difficulties in supplying the military, alienating the military and the people, spreading rumors every day, falsely reporting military information, promoting defeatist sentiments, currying favor with the Communists, in order to preserve their lives and property, and a few even thinking of seizing the puppet regime. The military is well aware of this kind of conscienceless, treacherous trick, and has obtained important evidence. Continuing to suppress the rebellion has been the government's decision, and the conspiracy of this committee should be strictly prohibited. If they do not cease their activities and continue to act as if they are colluding with the enemy, they will be severely punished according to Article 11 of the Martial Law and the Ten Urgent Measures for Wuhan Public Order that have been promulgated and made known.

### Defend Greater Shanghai; Second Day of Propaganda Week; Expanded Radio Propaganda Conducted

[Central News Agency, This City] Yesterday was the second day of the "Defend Greater Shanghai, Anti-Communist Propaganda Week" organized by all sectors of this city. Personnel from the city's broadcasting industry, in response to the call for propaganda, conducted expanded radio propaganda throughout the day at the Shanghai Radio Station. Mayor Chen Liang, Party Chief Fang Zhi, Gu Zhenggang, Standing Committee Member of the Political Affairs Committee of the Jinghu Hang Garrison Headquarters, Zhang Taixiang, representative of Commander Chen, and Tan Yimin were specially invited to deliver broadcasts.

Gu Zhenggang's Broadcast

Demanding Shanghai Compatriots to Achieve Five Things

[Central News Agency, This City] Mr. Gu Zhenggang, Standing Committee Member of the Political Affairs Committee of the Jinghu Hang Garrison Headquarters, delivered a broadcast yesterday at the invitation of the city's anti-communist and national salvation propaganda week. The original text is as follows:

Shanghai Compatriots:

The cunning and ferocious face of the Communist Party has been fully exposed. The Communist Party's military aggression has expanded to Shanghai. To protect the lives and property of the people of Shanghai, to strive for the freedom of life for the people of Shanghai, and to maintain the independent survival of the entire nation, and to save the calamity of national subjugation, we should rise up together, concentrate our strength, align our steps, give them a head-on blow, to defend our Greater Shanghai, to strive for the final victory of the anti-communist war.

We know that the Communist Party is the Fifth Column of the Third International. It has no national position and no national concept. In his declaration opposing the North Atlantic Treaty on April 4th of this year, Mao Zedong openly advocated that in the Third World War, he would support the Soviet Union and fight alongside them. He also changed the title of the Republic of China to the People's Republic of China, and used the flag with the sickle and hammer as our national flag. Think about it, isn't this trying to make China a vassal of the Soviet Union? If the Communist Party seizes power, China will surely face the fate of national subjugation, and the 450 million compatriots will become slaves of a conquered nation.

We know that the Communist Party is a violent group. It puts on a layer of democratic and free sugar-coating, but hides the poison of violent autocracy. The cruel facts of liquidation and struggle in the Communist-occupied areas are terrifying. Even in Beiping and Tianjin, in areas where they advocate urban policies and call for democracy and freedom, their deprivation of the people's freedom and oppression of the people's actions have made the people lose all freedom in their lives. Therefore, under their violent autocracy, the lives and property of the people are absolutely not guaranteed, and the freedom of the people is completely deprived. If the Communist Party seizes power, think about it, can we still survive under this violent oppression? Won't the Chinese people suffer a tragic life of slavery?

The tragedy of national subjugation is about to befall us, and we must not sit idly by. We must rise up to save ourselves and save the country, expose the Communist Party's conspiracy to invade China for the Third International, recognize that this war is absolutely not a civil war, and unite to participate in the anti-aggression national war, participate in the anti-totalitarian democratic war, and participate in the sacred war to defend the independent survival of the nation.

Shanghai Compatriots! We must recognize the significance of this war. We must recognize that today's Greater Shanghai Defense War is the vanguard war to save the country from subjugation, strive for the victory of the Greater Shanghai Defense War, so that this great international city will not suffer the brutal destruction of the Communist bandits, so that the city's five million free citizens will not fall into the dark Iron Curtain, and even more to defend the independent survival of the nation, so as not to suffer the tragic fate of national subjugation. Its significance is so great! Therefore, I ask the people of Shanghai to achieve the following points in this war:

First, we must have a firm belief in victory: The Communist Party has become the Fifth Column of the Third International, wanting to destroy our country and enslave our people. It is more vicious than Qin Hui and more shameless than a traitor. It has also rebelled against the Chinese national spirit and violated the will of the 450 million Chinese people. Its rampant behavior is only temporary and will inevitably fail. Our war against aggression and totalitarianism, and for the independent freedom and survival of the nation, will join forces with the world's democratic and free united front to jointly eliminate international violent groups. We are justified and will surely win.

Second, we must have unified combat steps: For all wartime measures in this city, we must jointly support and implement them as one, so that the hearts of our five million citizens can be united as one, and the strength of our five million citizens can be united into a whole force. Such a strong combat body will naturally be invincible.

Third, we must not speculate or compromise: We must raise revolutionary vigilance, develop the revolutionary spirit, eliminate the psychology of defeatism, and strictly monitor and thoroughly eliminate speculators, compromisers, and spies. From past lessons, we believe that local peace is surrender, compromise halfway is destruction, and helping Communist bandits is treason.

Fourth, we must contribute money and effort: Shanghai has unlimited assets and vast manpower. This is precisely the capital for us to eliminate the Communist bandits, and this is precisely the weapon for us to strive for victory. I have said to the people of Shanghai before that we must go bankrupt to protect our property, and we must fight to protect our lives. Now is the time. Those who have money should take out money, and those who have strength should take out their strength. Do not let the Communist bandits liquidate our property and kill our lives.

Fifth, we must comfort the soldiers and rescue the wounded: Finally, I want to say to all of you, we have a firm determination and full preparation for the defense of Greater Shanghai. Countless brave soldiers in the front have formed an irresistible fortress, ready to give the invading enemy a serious blow. I hope that the people of Shanghai will offer more condolences to these heroes who are fighting, and quickly provide rescue to the wounded, to encourage morale and welcome victory.

Shanghai Compatriots! Fellow compatriots who do not want to be destroyed by the Communist bandits and do not want to be slaves of the Communist International! We must rise up, we must rise up regardless of men, women, old and young, occupation, and class, and use the strength of six million people to build an iron Great Wall to defend Greater Shanghai. We want to use Shanghai as the enemy's grave. We believe that Shanghai is the base for counter-attack. The war in Shanghai is the beginning of our victory.

Chen Liang's Broadcast Speech

Enduring Hardships Will Surely Lead to Self-Salvation and National Salvation

[Central News Agency, This City] Mayor Chen broadcasted on Shanghai Radio at 7:00 PM yesterday. The original text is as follows: Because of the breakdown of peace, the flames of war have approached the outskirts of our Greater Shanghai. The responsibility for defending Greater Shanghai has been added to the shoulders of all our citizens. Why do we want to suppress the rebellion and oppose communism? Because our Republic of China was established in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Although the Communist Party repeatedly claims to respect the Three Principles of the People, it actually does the opposite. In terms of nationalism, they only have the international line and absolutely no concept of nation. In terms of democracy, they only have one-party dictatorship, or even the autocracy of a very small number of people, and there is absolutely no democracy to speak of. In terms of people's livelihood, they absolutely do not allow freedom for the people's clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Therefore, defending Greater Shanghai is not only the responsibility of the government and the army, but also the interest and life-and-death juncture of all Shanghai citizens themselves. In terms of military affairs, Commander-in-Chief Tang has made thorough arrangements, and the works on the four suburbs have made this city a complete fortress. Citizens can rest assured. However, the progress of military affairs depends on the cooperation of politics and economy, and the morale of the front depends on the encouragement of the people in the rear. Therefore, at this time of great crisis, on the one hand, we must be calm, respond calmly to changes, and at the same time, we must "be of one heart and one mind," "help each other in the same boat," "contribute money and effort," "go bankrupt to protect our property, and fight to protect our lives," "broaden our horizons," "lengthen our vision," "sacrifice the small self," and "preserve the big self." Shanghai is the essence of the country, with a large amount of manpower and materials. As long as we can work together and move towards the same goal, enduring the current hardships, we will surely be able to achieve the purpose of self-salvation and national salvation. During the Great War, most of the Soviet Union's territory had been occupied, and the German army advanced straight in, like a hot knife through butter. After the Battle of Stalingrad, the citizens of the Soviet Union participated in the war regardless of their own lives, and were finally able to turn the tide and achieve final victory. By analogy, the war in Shanghai can be absolutely optimistic. My duty is to "serve the citizens." Maintaining order in the urban area and stabilizing the lives of citizens is the focus of the entire municipal government at present. I am willing to share weal and woe with the city's six million citizens to complete the task of defending Greater Shanghai.

Fang Zhi's Broadcast Speech

Everything for the Front Line, Everything for the Soldiers

[Central News Agency, This City] Party Chief Fang Zhi broadcasted a speech during the "Defend Greater Shanghai, Anti-Communist Propaganda Week," stating roughly: "Today is the second day of the anti-communist propaganda week in this city. All compatriots in the city must know that the reason why we are anti-communist is because the Communist bandits are selling out the country and willingly acting as running dogs of the red imperialists. They are no longer Chinese, but complete traitors. The reason why we want to suppress the bandits is because the Communist bandits not only sell out the country and the nation, but also force the people and enslave the people, using them as cannon fodder. Today they rob one place, tomorrow they burn and kill another. Today there is struggle, tomorrow there is liquidation, so that husbands and wives, children and daughters cannot reunite in every family, and so that the people cannot live. Therefore, we cannot but suppress the bandits. In the past, we Chinese did not want to be subjugated by Japan, and now we should not want to be subjugated by the Communist International. Therefore, in order to save the country, we must suppress the bandits. Secondly, today we see how tragic and dark the lives of the people under the control of the Communist bandits are. If we compare ourselves with others, we should rise up to save the people who are also Chinese, in order to achieve the goal of saving the country and saving the people.

Now that we have understood the principle of anti-communism and bandit suppression, we must talk about how the citizens of Shanghai should rise up to do it, because if we want to save ourselves, we must first save others, and then further save the country. Defending Greater Shanghai is to defend the whole of China, because Shanghai is the largest city and the economic lifeline of the country. We should not be afraid and worried just because Nanjing, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, and Hangzhou have been occupied by the Communist bandits. We must realize that as long as we can defend Shanghai, the Communist bandits will be surrounded by us. Speaking of defending Shanghai, I am not saying that every ordinary person has to risk their lives. Now, there are hundreds of thousands of armed brothers risking their lives on the front line. They are risking their lives for us, and we should of course respect them. The people of Shanghai can still live today entirely because of these armed brothers who are fighting bloody battles on the front line. Therefore, here, I must appeal to all the compatriots in the city, those who have money should contribute money, those who have strength should contribute strength, and everyone should help the armed brothers. You must know that what they eat, wear, live in, and use is not as good as ours, and they are living the most difficult lives. We must send them the best things to eat, the best things to use, the best things to wear, and the best things to enjoy, which is what is called "everything for the front line" and "everything for the soldiers." Only in this way can there be true military-civilian cooperation, and only then can we be worthy of these national heroes.

Fellow citizens of the city, now is the final moment of life and death for us citizens of Shanghai. We must show our greatest character, and bring out the great revolutionary spirit of "January 28th" and "August 13th" in the past, to eliminate the Communist bandits and save the country and ourselves."

### Secret Meeting in the Legislative Yuan: President He Reports on the Current Situation; The Government Resolves to Fight to the End and Details the Breakdown of Peace Talks

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th] At 10:00 AM on the 10th, the President of the Executive Yuan, Ying Qin, presented a report on the current political, economic, military, and diplomatic situation at the 18th session of the Third Plenary Session of the Legislative Yuan, held in secret. The main points are as follows:

Chairman and esteemed members:

The fact that your esteemed Yuan is continuing its Third Plenary Session in Guangzhou, the cradle of the revolution, cannot but make us recall the situation in which the Father of the Nation led the revolution in Guangzhou. At that time, the base of the Father of the Nation's leadership of the revolution was only the two provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi, but after the sacrifice and struggle of countless martyrs, the corrupt forces were finally eliminated, and the country was unified, achieving the initial success of the revolution. Now that the Communist Party has broken the peace talks and invaded the South on a large scale, we are gathered here, and although our mood is very heavy, when we think of the greatness of the Father of the Nation and the tragic past of countless men of benevolence and lofty ideals, our spirit is still extremely excited and uplifted.

At the beginning of Ying Qin's appointment as President of the Executive Yuan, he adhered to the established policy of Acting President Li and the government to seek peace with the greatest sincerity and tolerance, but due to the Communist Party's insistence on its own way and unreasonable oppression, the peace talks ultimately failed and have entered a new stage of battle. Now, in order to ensure the survival of the nation, the continuation of inherent moral culture, and the maintenance of the free way of life of every citizen, we have no choice but to mobilize all our strength to engage in a decisive struggle with the Communist Party. Ying Qin manages the affairs of the Yuan and also oversees national defense. As long as he is in office, he will do his best with loyalty and dedication.

Yesterday, we received a notice from your esteemed Yuan, instructing us to report here on the past failure of the peace talks and the future countermeasures regarding diplomacy, military affairs, and economics. Now, we respectfully present a brief report as follows:

The Breakdown of Peace Talks and its Responsibility

Regarding the breakdown of the peace negotiations between the government and the Communist Party, Ying Qin made an oral report to your esteemed Yuan in Nanjing on the afternoon of April 20th. Now, to avoid repeatedly recounting the details, only a few words are added to summarize:

On April 16th, Representative Huang Shaohong flew from Beiping to Nanjing, bringing with him the Communist Party's so-called final revision of the "Domestic Peace Agreement," which was divided into eight articles and twenty-four clauses, limiting the government representatives to sign it before the 20th. The articles listed have been published in the newspapers, so they will not be repeated here. Looking at the content of the agreement, the Communist Party was not talking about peace at all, but completely surrendering. The harshness of the conditions was a hundred or a thousand times worse than the surrender document of Japan to the Allied countries. This fully shows that the Communist Party had no sincerity in peace at all. After receiving this "ultimatum" of forced surrender from the Communist Party, Acting President Li, the presidents of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan, and the central military and political leaders in Beijing, including Ying Qin, held consultations for several days. They believed that the basic spirit of the "Agreement" proposed by the Communist Party, and its articles, were contrary to the principles listed in the opinion on the peace issue passed by your esteemed Yuan on March 1st, and the principles of peace talks shown in the administrative policy guidelines reported by Ying Qin to your esteemed Yuan on March 30th, "to establish the peaceful unification of the country, and strive to conduct comprehensive peace negotiations with the Chinese Communist Party under fair and reasonable principles." Therefore, it was decided to telegraph the government's peace negotiation delegation to convey to the Communist Party, stating that it could not accept these forced surrender conditions that violated the interests of the people. The original telegram stated, "Hoping that the Chinese Communist Party will confirm the principle that the interests of the people are higher than everything else, and reconsider the basic spirit and content of this agreement," and also said, "In order to cultivate a peaceful atmosphere, it is hoped that a temporary ceasefire agreement can be established immediately, in order to express the determination and sincerity of both sides to seek genuine peace." This decision and the original telegram to the government's peace negotiation representatives were reported to your esteemed Yuan at 4:00 PM on April 20th, and were approved by your esteemed Yuan. The telegram was sent to Beiping before 11:00 PM on the same day and delivered to the Communist Party.

Since President Chiang issued a proclamation advocating peace on New Year's Day this year, the Communist army has stopped attacking Zhu. After the government's peace negotiation delegation arrived in Ping on April 1st, the offensive of the Communist army on all fronts became even more fierce. The Communist Party set April 20th as the deadline for its final ultimatum, but on the same day, the Communist army crossed the river from the Digang area. At noon on the 21st, Mao Zedong and Zhu De ordered a full-scale general attack on the National Army, which led to the breakdown of the talks. Therefore, Ying Qin wants to solemnly declare to your esteemed Yuan that the breakdown of the peace talks was due to the Communist Party's lack of sincerity and its order for a general attack and large-scale crossing of the river. Therefore, the Communist Party should bear full responsibility for the breakdown of the peace talks.

After Mao Zedong and Zhu De ordered the Communist army to cross the river for a general attack on the 21st, Acting President Li and I telegraphed our government's peace negotiation delegation on the 22nd, deciding to send a plane to Beiping to pick up the delegation in Nanjing that day. At 9:00 AM on the 23rd, a special plane took off from Beijing to Ping. Because the airline received a telegram from the company in Beiping saying that the airport was under repair and could not land, the special plane was recalled by radio. On the 24th, I sent a plane from Shanghai to Ping again, carrying a letter from me to Chief Representative Zhang Zhizhong and all representatives, requesting all representatives to take a special plane back to Shanghai that day. On the 25th, the special plane returned to Shanghai, bringing back letters from Representative Zhang and five others. Only then did we learn that our delegation had been detained by the Communist Party and not allowed to return to the South. On the 27th, the Executive Yuan held a meeting in Guangzhou and resolved to revoke the government's peace negotiation delegation and publish the report of Representative Zhang and others in the newspaper. Representative Zhang Zhizhong originally served as the chief military and political officer of the Northwest. Since he was detained and could not return to his post to perform his duties, and the major plans of the Northwest military and political affairs were important and could not be without someone in charge, the Executive Yuan meeting decided on May 4th to dismiss him and appoint Deputy Chief Officer Ji to act as his agent.

Current Military, Economic, and Diplomatic Situation

President He continued to report on the emergency measures taken by the government to move its institutions from Nanjing to Guangzhou after the breakdown of the peace talks, and the various situations of our side after the Communist army crossed the river. He expounded on the current military, economic, and diplomatic situation. Regarding the economic aspect, He declared that the government is working hard to: (1) strive to stabilize the financial situation and gradually stabilize prices; (2) solve the shortage of banknotes in various places; (3) improve the treatment of civil servants and teachers; and (4) improve the method of settling foreign exchange for exports. President He concluded his report by saying that Ying Qin was appointed President of the Executive Yuan at a time of crisis. At the beginning of his term, he originally planned to conduct peace talks with the Communist Party with the greatest sincerity and tolerance, based on fair and reasonable principles, in order to realize the peace and unification of the country and relieve the people from the suffering of being turned upside down. However, the Communist Party had no sincerity at all and always wanted to conquer the entire motherland by force, and be the vanguard of foreign aggression. Therefore, they brazenly ended the peace talks with forced surrender conditions, and at the same time, they crossed the river on a large scale, expanding the war. Ying Qin felt deeply that things did not go as wished, and was extremely ashamed. Now, fortunately, Acting President Li has arrived in Guangzhou, the seat of the government, the Legislative Yuan and the Supervisory Yuan have also gathered in Guangzhou. There must be wise decisions on the major plans for saving the country and seeking survival. The administrative authorities at all levels follow their own paths, and they can reduce mistakes and work together to achieve success. Today, we are determined to fight the Chinese Communist Party to the end for the independence of the country, the integrity of territorial sovereignty, and the free way of life of the people. As long as we can do the eight characters of "one heart and one mind, gather our strength," and seek reform, seek progress, do not waver, do not yield, the central and local governments will merge into one, and the people and the government will unite as one, the final victory will surely be ours. I said before: "I firmly believe that the final victory will belong to the patriots, not to the traitors, and will belong to the democrats and liberals, not to the violent dictators." Now I still use these words as the conclusion of today's report, and I respectfully ask for your guidance, gentlemen.

### The Legislative Yuan Passes a Resolution to Form a Committee to Draft a Policy Outline for Extraordinary Times; A Statement on the Current Situation is Scheduled to be Issued at the Next Yuan Meeting

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th] The 18th session of the Third Plenary Session of the Legislative Yuan continued at 3:30 PM on the afternoon of the 10th. Chairman Jiang Yiping reported on the following matters: (1) The Executive Yuan requested the review of the Sino-Italian Friendship Treaty, and it was resolved to submit it to the Foreign Affairs Committee for review. (2) In Article 8, Paragraph 6 of the Regulations on the Prohibition of Opium and Drugs and the Punishment of Crimes, the phrase "smoking drugs" was omitted after the phrase "injecting morphine." It was resolved to add it as it stands.

### Editorial: Seeking a Turning Point in the Japan Issue

The Four Powers have reached an agreement on the Berlin issue, and the Foreign Ministers' Conference will be held in Paris this month. The long-deadlocked German issue has obviously reached a turning point, and the date for signing the peace treaty with Germany seems to be just around the corner; but what about the Japan issue? Can a turning point be achieved in this Foreign Ministers' Conference? This is the most concerned issue for the countries concerned in Asia. According to a United Press report from Washington on the 6th: "Western diplomats believe that the upcoming Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Conference will find a turning point in the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. They all believe that the Soviet Union is in a pivotal position for the permanent peace of both Europe and Asia, and the Soviet Union has completed it at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference." This report by the United Press diplomatic reporter is a very close guess. The resolution of the Berlin issue is not only a turning point in opening the German issue, but also a major turning point in world peace: in other words: since the United States and the Soviet Union can compromise on the German issue, they are naturally willing to resolve the Japanese issue as soon as possible.

No one can deny that the United States has independently controlled defeated Japan in the name of the Allied Forces for four years without any success, and the price it has paid is very alarming, making the American people feel overwhelmed. In February of this year, American military strategists in Tokyo once strongly advocated the "abandonment of Japan and the withdrawal of the occupying forces." They unanimously believed that Japan was not defensible and was not worth defending; if the US military still remained in Japan in a future war, the United States would have to bear the obligation of supplying food to Japan's 80 million people, which seemed not worth the loss. Although this argument belongs to the US military strategy plan in the Far East, the failure of the US control of Japan is obvious. Furthermore, the attitude of the Allied Forces towards Japan is far less enthusiastic than it used to be. I remember that when the theory of supporting Japan was singing high, MacArthur was happy to agree to any request from Japan, especially in economically assisting Japan, sparing no effort; but in March and April of this year, MacArthur suddenly wanted Japan to be self-reliant, and pointed out an "economic nine principles" for the Yoshida cabinet to earnestly follow. On May 2, MacArthur issued a statement, also saying that "the purpose revealed by the Allied countries at the Potsdam Conference, the main points of which are mostly completed, but the reason why the Allied forces have not withdrawn so far is not Japan's fault, but Japan's inability to control external situations. From now on, the Allied forces' occupation has changed from strict military control to the friendly guidance of the protection force."

MacArthur's statement is tantamount to a confession admitting the failure of controlling Japan. Logically, the United States should have tried to reach a compromise with the Soviet Union long ago, but a traditional wrong concept still dominates the psychology of the US government and the public. Knowing that controlling Japan is not worth the loss, they are unwilling to give up easily. Therefore, MacArthur made three suggestions to the Far East Commission on the 6th of this month: (1) Grant Japan some international relations rights so that it can participate in international society, restore foreign trade, and help its economic recovery and the early withdrawal of the occupying forces. (2) Step up the implementation of land reform to improve the economic situation of tenant farmers. (3) Relax the restrictions on Japan's foreign policy and trade policy so that it can participate in any international conference. We will not ask what MacArthur's motives are for the time being? But before the peace treaty with Japan has been signed, allowing Japan to participate in international society is ultimately an unwise move that violates the Potsdam Declaration. No wonder the representatives of Britain, France, and the Philippines also expressed their opposition. If the United States submits this issue to the Far East Commission for discussion, we believe that the Chinese and Soviet representatives will definitely not agree to this proposal.

We review the US's Japan policy in the past four years, which can be said to be one mistake after another, trapped in the quagmire of mistakes and unable to extricate itself. From the ultimate result of supporting Japan, it is also harmful and useless. This policy of harming others and hurting oneself should have been changed long ago; but the US diplomatic authorities are still obsessed with it, and they are still trying every possible means to raise Japan's military status, trying to gain a helper in future international conferences; but from the perspective of onlookers, everything that the United States has done in Japan is tantamount to burying landmines there, which will inevitably lead to a catastrophe in the Far East once they explode in the future. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the US diplomatic authorities can seize the turning point for world peace given by the resolution of the Berlin issue, and seek a turning point in the Japan issue, so as to open up the long-deadlocked Japanese stalemate. Now is the time for the US government and the public to reconsider their Japan policy. Do not hesitate any longer, mislead yourself and others, and allow the Japan issue to remain in a stalemate for a long time, which will only benefit the former aggressor countries.

### Chinese Tung Oil Floods the American Market

American Farmers Compete with Our Products

[United Press Washington, 9th] Roland, secretary of the National Tung Tree Planting Industry Council of the United States, told reporters today that Chinese tung oil has flooded the market. The source was cut off during the war, but now American farmers have to compete with cheap Chinese exports. Irwin, a veteran from New York, planted tung trees in Mississippi and has reportedly suffered losses for two years, selling tung nuts for only about $44.50 per ton, and may be forced to sell his farmland. The United States has tung trees planted in Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Georgia, and Alabama, but 80 percent of the tung oil used is now from China.

### New Microscope Can Magnify 600,000 Times

[United Press New York, 9th] According to the Atomic Science Magazine, Magnan of the Atomic and Molecular Physics Laboratory of the French Academy of Sciences in Paris announced that he has invented a new microscope that uses light atomic nuclei radiation and can magnify objects 600,000 times. Electron microscopes can only magnify about 100,000 times. These light atomic nuclei are single protons whose wave motion is the same as light, and their luminescence is the same as light, electrons, and X-rays. The images taken are also the same as electrons and X-rays. Its advantage is that the skin length of protons is much shorter than any kind of wave, so it can see smaller objects.

We hope to use modern methods and technology to improve our economic level and build a new life for our people. We hope that the seven-year plan will give us economic development."

### The Whole Story of the Karen Rebellion in Burma

— Xu Siren

The Karen are considered the second largest ethnic group among the various ethnic groups in Burma (the largest being the Burmese). Their total population, according to pre-war statistics, was 1,341,066, accounting for one-tenth of the total population of Burma. They are mostly scattered in the delta of Lower Burma and along the Salween River in southern Burma. According to the research of British scholar Stevenson, the Karen originally belonged to the Thai-Chinese ethnic group and migrated into Burma from a part of Yunnan Province in China, residing in the Donggua mountainous area of Upper Burma. Later, a part of them moved to Bassein in the delta and the southern part of the Arakan Mountains in the northwest. Initially, they were afraid of the Burmese and dared not migrate to Burmese areas. It was not until the British ruled Burma and after many years of peace that they dared to slowly move to the plains of the Irrawaddy River, the delta, and the Tenasserim region. The Karen are loyal and simple, but lack creativity. Within the Karen, there are Red Karen. The Red Karen are further divided into Black Karen and Striped Karen. The total population of the Red, Black, and Striped Karen is about 200,000, mostly scattered in the mountains around Donggua. The "mountain friends" mentioned in Campbell's letter refer to these Red Karen.

The Karen originally had no written language or historical records. Initially, they only had natural traditions passed down from generation to generation. It was not until after the First Anglo-Burmese War that British and American missionaries invented a writing system for them, but it was mostly based on the Burmese script. The alphabet consists of 25 consonants and 7 vowels. Because they live with many Burmese, most of them understand Burmese language and customs are not very different from the Burmese, except that the Karen are Christians, while the Burmese are Buddhists. This is largely due to British influence. Because Karen culture was brought by the British, most Karen people have received secondary English education. In the past, when the British ruled Burma, every Karen area had church-run English schools, so Karen men and women had the opportunity to receive a British education.

It is precisely because of these educational and religious ties that the Karen are mostly pro-British. It is also because of this relationship that during the British rule of Burma, many local administrative officials were Karen, and the Burmese National Army was also based on Karen. They followed the British intentions and carried out the work of the rulers, which was deeply resented by the Burmese. However, during the British rule, there were no major hostile incidents. It was not until the Japanese occupied Burma that, due to the Japanese instigation, a tragic massacre occurred, with more than 10,000 deaths on both sides. This planted the seeds of hatred between the two ethnic groups, leading to the ethnic war tragedy that has now occurred.

Regarding this Karen-Burmese ethnic war, the reporter believes that the most worrying thing is that it will plant even deeper roots of hatred. Because once the war starts, the administrative officials in the war zone retreat to the rear, and the Burmese army lacks political departments, allowing the army to run amok, which often leads to things going awry. For example, one day when the reporter went to the war zone to cover the news, a Burmese soldier asked the reporter if he wanted to see Karen corpses. The reporter asked how they were killed. He said that yesterday when they attacked a Karen village, they caught six Karen people in the village and took them to the river and killed them. Naturally, whether those six Karen were insurgents is still questionable. The Burmese army's summary execution of them will only make the Karen hate the Burmese even more.

Cycle of Retribution

Another Burmese officer told the reporter a tragic story, but the Burmese officer told the story triumphantly. He said: "Once we captured a Karen village, and all the Karen people in the village had fled. But in the kitchen of a rather exquisite Karen house, we found a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen. Maybe she didn't have time to escape. When she saw us, she was very panicked and claimed that she was Burmese, saying that as long as we didn't kill her, we could do whatever we wanted. We said: We don't want you. Your Karen men are disrupting our discipline, and we want revenge. Later, we told her that we would take you to the monks to be dealt with. Because the monks advocated killing, we killed her." As he said this, he made a gesture of beheading and explained how the girl's head fell. Since the outbreak of the war, news of the two ethnic groups' armies raping women of the opposing ethnic group and killing civilians of the opposing ethnic group has been heard from time to time. In addition, the Burmese army has adopted a scorched-earth policy, burning down all Karen villages, regardless of whether they have insurgents or not. In retaliation, the Karen army also adopted the same tactics against the Burmese whenever they captured Burmese areas. The reporter once visited a Burmese family whose house had been burned down. He said angrily: "All my family's livelihood depended on this. These sons of bitches (referring to the Karen who burned his house) were so heartless as to burn everything I had. I will live here forever, and there will be a day when we meet!" All such things are enough to deepen the hatred between the two ethnic groups. If the roots of this poisonous bacteria are not quickly pulled out, even if this war is resolved peacefully, a second war will inevitably occur in the future.

Source of Weapons

The source of the weapons used by the Karen in this rebellion is roughly from the following aspects: (1) Left over from the Japanese army. After the Japanese army retreated from northern and central Burma, all their forces were concentrated in southern Burma, facing the Allied forces across the Sittang River. Later, Japan surrendered in Burma, and the Japanese army in southern Burma also automatically disarmed. Of the more than 300,000 Japanese troops in Burma, most of the weapons surrendered, except for a part received by the British army, fell into the hands of the Karen. (2) When the Allied forces counterattacked Burma, in February 1945, Colonel Blaire led the 136th Regiment to land in the Karen area to organize the Karen guerrillas. After the war, most of these guerrillas were formed into the Burmese National Army. After Burma's independence, perhaps the British intentionally left poison, these National Army soldiers were ostensibly disbanded, but secretly they were reorganized into smaller units, and the weapons naturally remained. In addition to these two channels, as mentioned above, the Burmese government believes that the British secretly provided the Karen with weapons.

The Crux of the Problem

The reason why this Karen-Burmese conflict is so difficult to resolve is that the Karen insist on establishing their own state with autonomy, but the government believes that it has serious vested interests and cannot grant their request. The Burmese government's reason is that in some of the areas that the Karen are demanding to be劃分delineated, Karen residents only account for 30%, and in some places only 19%. There is no possibility of establishing another ethnic nation at all, and there are also economic problems. Speaking fairly from a third-party perspective, the Karen have the right to demand autonomy, but the demands they have made are a bit excessive, because the areas that the Karen are demanding to be delineated are all rich areas. To speak frankly for the Burmese government, it is: "You want all the good things, what do I have left?" However, the vested interests are not limited to this. The most important thing is the port issue. The areas that the Karen are demanding to be delineated, such as Bassein and Tavoy, are all ports where ocean-going vessels can dock. If the government allows the Karen to establish a state in these places, with the Karen's past relationship with Britain as a springboard for a comeback, they will inevitably use the Karen area as a breeding ground for economic aggression. Therefore, if the Burmese government allows the Karen to establish a state, it is tantamount to digging a hole in its own pocket. Therefore, the Burmese government insists that it cannot agree to the Karen's demand for statehood.

Future Prospects

The Karen-Burmese conflict and vested interests have been described above, so this incident is indeed a very difficult problem to solve. On March 1, the Indian government convened an informal meeting of the British Commonwealth countries in Southeast Asia in India to discuss ways to mediate the Karen-Burmese conflict. As a result of the discussion, the participating countries (including India, Pakistan, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Ceylon) jointly sent a letter to Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu, requesting mediation of the Karen-Burmese conflict, but the Burmese government has not yet responded. If this conflict cannot be resolved peacefully, the Karen already possess the areas and weapons mentioned above, and most of the Karen youth have military knowledge, and they are united and brave. Then Burma's future destiny will encounter even greater misfortunes, which is to be expected. (End of full text)

### Shantou Team to Battle Maoxun Today for Top Eight Spots; Kang Team and Pang Team to Face Huanan and Chongde Respectively

The knockout stage of the Group Two Basketball League playoffs begins today. There will be three games starting at 5:00 PM, still held at the Municipal Gymnasium. Admission is free. The schedule is as follows:

Pang Team — Chongde (Group Three) 5:00 PM

Kang Team — Huanan (Group Two) 6:00 PM

Shantou Team — Maoxun (Group One) 7:00 PM

In the first game, Pang Team from Group Three will face Chongde. Pang Team was fifth in Section C, while Chongde was fourth in Section D. The former defeated Jianle Iron Union in the sectional matches, so their fighting strength is still acceptable. The latter has not won a single victory since the start of the season. When the two teams meet, Pang Team has a better chance of winning.

Next, Kang Team from Group Two will compete with Huanan. This group consists of the third and fourth-place teams from each section. Kang Team was originally from Section A, while Huanan was from Section B. Led by veteran Lu Dazhen, Kang Team has many young players such as Tong Tingxuan, Wang Chang'an, Rong Chengen, and Zhou Lang, who have plenty of stamina. Huanan's He Hanfu, Huang Tianlie, and Li Xianzheng are also veterans of the arena. The two teams will surely put on a fierce battle.

The final game is between Shantou Team, the champion of Section D, and Maoxun, the runner-up of Section A. Supported by Chen Qingjiang, Luo Shaoqiong, and Zheng Guofan, Shantou Team still maintains its fast-paced style. They defeated Chenyou, Pushui, Chongde, and Red Cavalry in Section D to win the championship. Now, in order to compete for a spot in the top eight, they will go all out. Maoxun is a top team in Section A. Players such as Sun Jiafei, Liu Zhaoren, Zhuo Guanren, and Yang Jizhen have excellent records. Facing a strong enemy, they will be cautious. The battle on the court will surely be exciting.

### Table Tennis League Group A: Huamei Scores Two Victories, Passing Five Hurdles

Hualian to Face Youyi in Today's Group A Match

In the fourth Table Tennis League, Group A's Huamei played against Youyi and Youwu Brothers the day before yesterday at the Youwu Gymnasium. More than 400 spectators attended, and the court was packed. The atmosphere was enthusiastic. Huamei is strong, and victory was expected, but the two main players did not perform up to par. For example, Xue Xuchu, who is skilled in long rallies and short pushes, was flustered in his shots. In the first match against Youyi veteran Yu Chunrong, Yu used close blocks to counterattack, putting Xuchu in a difficult battle. In the second game, the two even tied at 25 all. Xue finally won by a single point. In the next match, Xuchu played against young player Wang Chuanyao, but he still played abnormally. Chuanyao fought hard and did not retreat. Both games were lost after leading. If he could have been more composed, he would have had a good chance of winning. The audience said that Xuchu was lucky to escape unscathed. In another match, veteran Lu Hanjun tried his best in the first game against Youwu's Liu Zaoshi, but he was defeated 1-2. Fortunately, Qin Duyan in the second group defeated Jiang Chunshan, a topspin player, allowing them to overcome the danger. Overall, Huamei's fighting strength was affected by the absence of Li Zongpei and Fu Qifang. If Xue and Lu make any more mistakes, there may be changes in future matches against the four strong teams: Jingwu Lianxing, Hualian, and Quanlu. Youyi's Zhu Qingji defeated Huamei's young player Xue Weichu, breaking the zero-point record. Youwu resisted calmly. Although they lost 2-3, they can be said to have lost with honor. As a result, Huamei had a double victory, maintaining a record of five wins and five losses. The records of the two games are as follows:

(Huamei) Score (Youyi)

Wang Jiuqing 2—0 Shen Airen

Lu Hanjun 2—0 Zhu Zhongsun

Xue Weichu 0—2 Zhu Qingji

Xue Xuchu 2—0 Yu Chunrong

Han De 2—1 Dai Yongquan

(Huamei) Score (Youwu)

Lu Hanjun 1—2 Liu Zaoshi

Qin Duyan 2—0 Jiang Chunshan

Xue Xuchu 2—0 Wang Chuanyao

Wang Jiuqing 2—0 Yang Peitian

Han De 1—2 Zhuang Kunrong

Today (11th), there will be another Group A match and three Group B matches. In Group A, Hualian will face Youyi at the Guohuo Gymnasium. Hualian has won both of its previous matches, but the strong topspin player Deng Xiurong has not yet participated, which has affected their strength. The rest of the players, such as Zhang Zhihong, Lu Wenliang, and Li Zhen, are all veterans. Although their sharpness has diminished slightly, they have clear minds and are extremely experienced in battle. Youyi also has many veterans, but the whole team lacks top-notch attacking talent, which puts them at a disadvantage. In today's match against Hualian, they will fight with all their might. The schedule for today is as follows:

Hualian — Youyi (Group A) 7:00 PM Guohuo

Fansheng — Zhongnong (Group B2) 7:00 PM Zhongnong

Meiya — You San (Group B3) 7:00 PM Youwu

Nongji Yi — Xinyi (Group B2) 7:00 PM Xinyi

### Huili Team Protests the Referees Association

The Huili Basketball Team issued the following statement regarding the refereeing incident: "To the sports sections of major newspapers in the city: We were surprised to read the news of the Shanghai Basketball Referees Association's decision in your sports columns on the 8th of this month, especially the item concerning our team. On May 4th, during the Mayor's Cup single round-robin tournament, our team played against Renyu. Chen Baolin and Xuan He were the referees. Five minutes before the end of the game, because Chen Baolin made several incorrect judgments, it stimulated the dissatisfaction of our team member Cao Zhiji. While passing the ball, he threw the basketball at the referee, resulting in his expulsion from the game. At that time, our team leader not only absolutely obeyed the referee's decision, but also tried to restrain the emotions of the players to avoid any accidents. Unexpectedly, the referee not only did not reflect on his poor skills, which led to the dispute, but also submitted a letter to the Referees Association asking the Basketball Committee to punish our team members Cao Zhiji and Tian Fuhai. (Tian Fuhai was deemed disrespectful for applauding the referee, but the referee did not express any objection at the time.) The most absurd thing is that the Referees Association threatened to stop sending referees to any of our team's games until the Cao and Tian incident is resolved. The Basketball Committee is interfering with the freedom of others and dare to abuse the authority of the Referees Association, forcibly suspending all sports activities of our team, destroying sports. Nothing could be worse. Our team was established less than a year ago, and our aim is to promote amateur sports and do our best. Unexpectedly, because of the misconduct of one or two team members, the entire team has been oppressed by the Referees Association. We are truly disheartened by the future of Shanghai sports. In addition to awaiting the decision of the Basketball Committee, we express our firm protest against the Referees Association's previous measures and appeal to all friendly teams and sports figures in the city to make a fair judgment."

### British Writer Researches That Football Originated in China

[British News Agency, London, 10th] According to an article "The Focus of Professional Football Games" written by Crickshank for the British Broadcasting Corporation, China is the originator of football. Crickshank said: The game of football did not originate in Scotland as commonly believed. As early as 2,400 years ago, China already had the game of football, and it was part of military training. He explained that what the Chinese played at that time was not the football that is popular in Britain today, but a football made of eight pieces of leather sewn together with hair inside, which was later changed to air. He also made a diagram comparing the football that was originally played in China with the football that is popular in Britain today, saying that in ancient China, on the emperor's birthday, two teams would compete in football in front of the palace, and the winner would receive prizes such as flowers, fruits, wine, and silver cups.

### Motor Vehicles That Have Been Taken Out of Service Must Still Pay the Special Tax

[Reported by this newspaper] The special tax on motor vehicles in this city began to be collected on the 9th of this month and must be paid in full within four days.

### Summer in the City: Huangpu River Night Cruises Likely Unrecoverable; Pessimistic Outlook for Cold Drink Production and Sales

[Our Newspaper's Report] Only a few days have passed since the start of summer according to the lunar calendar, and summer scenes are already visible everywhere in the city. The highest temperatures yesterday and the day before both reached over 80 degrees Fahrenheit, and it felt particularly hot at noon. In recent days, the number of visitors to large and small parks in the city has increased significantly, and the closing time of each park has been extended to after 8:00 PM in the evening. The summer Huangpu River night cruises, formerly organized by the city's ferry company, will not be able to resume this year due to restrictions from martial law. However, many public and private swimming pools in the city are currently being repaired and renovated, and it is heard that they will be opened in the short term.

The ice blocks most needed in the summer will likely still largely depend on the artificial ice from the Pudong area this year. The machine-made ice industry is under too heavy a burden from electricity costs and labor costs, and the price of raw materials such as ammonia is extremely high, so it is difficult to be optimistic about the output. As for the air-conditioning equipment that must be installed in all cinemas and dance halls every summer, according to these two industries, the installation this year will depend on how the business situation is. The entertainment industry is usually in a "slack season" in the summer, and it is expected that the seats will be dismal this year, even more so than in previous years. If this is the case, then even if the air-conditioning equipment is installed as usual, its opening will definitely be delayed until the extreme heat of midsummer.

A large number of cold drinks are already on the market. In terms of the purchasing power of the general public, their prices cannot be said to be low. For example, a large ice block sells for 3.2 million yuan, a paper cup of ice cream sells for 600,000 yuan, Coca-Cola and soda cost 500,000 yuan per bottle, and a popsicle costs 120,000 yuan per stick. According to the average statistics of larger sales stores in recent days, apart from popsicles and soda, other actual sales have failed to reach the ideal records of early summer last year.

### Municipal Government Orders: Security Donation Collection Suspended

It is learned that now, due to changes in the situation, the original method is no longer fully applicable. The municipal government has ordered the abolition of the aforementioned method, and the collection will be suspended starting today (the 11th). As for alternative methods, the municipal government is currently consulting with relevant parties to properly formulate them.

### A Tobacco Store on Changshou Road Robbed; Four Thieves Fled Across a Small River

[Our Newspaper's Report] At approximately 9:40 PM the night before last, four thieves broke into the Xintai Tobacco Store at No. 843 Changshou Road. Two were wearing turned-over shirts and trousers, and two were wearing black Zhongshan suits. They entered the store under the pretext of buying cigarettes, took out guns to intimidate the staff, and carried out a search and robbery. At that time, two uniformed police officers from the Changshou Road Police Station happened to pass by and caught sight of it. They immediately reported it to the Jiangning Road Police Branch in charge via telephone. Chief Li personally led a number of police officers to rush to arrest them. Who knew that the thieves had already fled towards the back door? Later, the Flying Fortress also heard the news and dispatched, arriving to find a small river outside the back door of the tobacco store. It was observed that there were faint footprints on the other side, so they followed the traces and pursued them. They searched inside until they reached a certain tanning workshop, but there were a large number of people in the workshop, so it was impossible to find them at once. The branch is continuing to investigate where the four thieves went.

### Youth Front Visiting Team Returns to Shanghai to Host Reporters; Waiting for an Opportunity to Prepare for a Decisive Battle Based on Observations Along the Way

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Youth Front Visiting Team, organized by students from universities and colleges in this city, returned to Shanghai yesterday after completing its mission on the 9th, having departed on the 6th of this month to visit various front-line areas. Zhang Danqiu and Zhang Gangjian, the persons in charge of the team, held a special reception for reporters at the Shanghai Club yesterday to report on the team's journey and the situation on the front line, saying: The entire team consisted of 130 people, divided into five district teams, with 25 to 30 people in each team. The locations visited this time were Kunshan, Lujiabang, and Nanxiang for the first district team; Taicang for the second district team; Jiaxing for the third district team; Songjiang and Huangdu for the fourth district team; and Chongming for the fifth district team. The observations made along the way can be summarized into several points:

All Circles Extend Their Sympathies, Hoping to Change to Physical Goods

(1) The morale of the National Army soldiers is extremely high, and their understanding of the combat goals is particularly clear. They all believe that the retreat from Jiangnan was not a defeat and feel infinitely saddened and indignant. (2) At present, the National Army on the front line lacks daily necessities, medical personnel, and spiritual food. It is hoped that the people in the rear can deeply understand this point and regularly provide assistance and support. They expressed that they especially welcome all circles to actually come to the front line for inspection, so as to communicate with each other. (3) The treatment of the National Army soldiers still needs to be improved quickly. Last month, each person actually received only the equivalent of about one silver yuan, which is often not enough even for postage. In addition, there is a severe shortage of daily necessities in various front-line areas, and it is impossible to add purchases of shoes, socks, shirts, and trousers, etc. Therefore, they hope that in the future, if various circles issue consolation money, it can be changed to practical items of the same value, without the need to issue silver dollars again. (4) They hope that their families can be properly taken care of and settled by the authorities so that they can concentrate on fighting.

Fishing by the River, Relaxed and Content

As for the general situation in various front-line areas at present, according to Zhang et al.'s report, the local administrative agencies in Kunshan and other counties have been evacuated, and the affairs of the administration are now concurrently managed by the heads of the stationed troops. Prices are generally lower than in Shanghai. One silver yuan can buy twelve catties of pork. The villages farther away from the front line are unusually quiet. Among the crowing of chickens and barking of dogs, soldiers mostly spend their time fishing by the river, appearing extremely relaxed. At present, the soldiers in various units are mostly people from the Subei Luyuan area or those who volunteered to join the army. They hope to be able to fight back to their hometowns as soon as possible, so they are all eagerly preparing to wait for the opportunity to seek a decisive battle with the main force of the Communist army. They deeply believe that this battle will be like the Battle of Zhuxian Town in the Song Dynasty, stabilizing Jiangnan with one battle, so that patriots in the occupied areas will also rise up in response to each other.

After returning to Shanghai this time, it is heard that the team will contact various industrial and commercial circles in this city and collect practical consolation goods, and will go to the front line again next week for in-depth visits. Representatives from the press will also be invited to participate at that time.

### Merchants Contracting Merchants Delay Delivery; Food Purchase and Storage Committee Requests Arrest and Pursuit; Serious Cases Will Be Handled According to Military Law

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Songhu Garrison Command recently approved a public letter from the Food Emergency Purchase and Storage Committee stating: In order to supply urban food distribution sources, a part of the committee is entrusted to merchants to contract or purchase spot bills of lading. Recently, the situation has been tense, and unscrupulous merchants have taken advantage of the opportunity, intending to wait and see, delaying delivery or failing to respond to the offer, directly attempting to defraud public funds and indirectly endangering the people's food and affecting social order. The cunning means of such unscrupulous merchants cannot be punished by ordinary legal procedures. This committee is responsible for maintaining the distribution of food for the people and cannot allow them to evade responsibility for a long time, affecting the committee's estimated food sources. Therefore, it is specifically requested to investigate. In the future, this committee plans to send all such unscrupulous merchants to your department for strict arrest and pursuit in accordance with the regulations on the governance of endangering the people's food within the martial law decree, in order to protect public funds and maintain the people's food, etc. After receiving the request, the Garrison Command immediately instructed the enforcement team of the department, the 9th Regiment of the Military Police, and the Municipal Police Department to earnestly assist in urging the handling of the matter at any time. If the circumstances are serious and there are indeed illegal facts, they shall be transferred to the department for investigation according to military law.

### The Gold Market Wants to Rise but Lacks Strength; Silver Ornaments Resume Listing Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday's gold market situation was such that because the authorities exerted heavy pressure, people were exhausted and unable to rise. Large investors did not dare to act rashly, and the market momentum wanted to rise but lacked strength. The off-site market opened at 200 million, 230 million in the morning, and rose to 210 million, 240 million. General manufacturers frequently came out, moving in small increments to 160 million, 190 million. The midday close recovered slightly to 200 million, 230 million. In the afternoon, those who did so were the same, and transactions were sluggish. It was still shouted at 200 million, 230 million, and finally fell to 190 million, 220 million. Some people sold, which was not much of an honor or disgrace compared to the previous day.

The off-site supply of US dollars was more than demand, and it also plummeted.

### Public Utilities Companies Act Arbitrarily; Still Charge According to Self-Compiled Index; Citizens are Perplexed and Helpless; All Hope for a Prompt Solution

[Central News Agency Report] After the pricing index of public utilities rose wildly day by day, manufacturers and citizens alike could not bear the burden and unanimously opposed it. After the Public Utilities Group of the Municipal Council responded to the public's demands and held a meeting a few days ago, it was resolved to cancel the pricing index of public utilities. Water and electricity fees for last month will be temporarily paid according to the wage index of over 370,000 times. However, the public utilities companies in this city did not accept this resolution, and still stipulated that fees should be paid according to the public utility pricing index of 790,000 times, which made ordinary citizens feel that they could not afford it, and they were afraid of power outages and water cuts, were perplexed and in pain, and could not help themselves. All hope that the municipal authorities will quickly formulate a method, maintain the purpose of protecting public utilities, and strive to reduce the burden on citizens.

### Two Accountants Suspected of Handling Silver Dollar Trading Registration are Investigated

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the Social Affairs Bureau began issuing silver dollar purchase and sale permits, it has been reported that accountant Jiao Dingkai and another accountant surnamed Wang are suspected of handling silver dollar trading registration for sellers.

Subsequently, Jiao Kai was allowed to post bail, and the accountant surnamed Wang was sent to the Garrison Command for handling because of more serious suspicion.

### Silver Dollar Trading is Sluggish; Only Miscellaneous Brands are Being Traded

[Our Newspaper's Report] There was no change in silver dollars yesterday. The general listing was still 3.8 million in and 4 million out, with Eagle Dollars, Dragon Dollars, and Sichuan Dollars being traded. Large investors did not show their faces.

The exchange of paper money for silver was still the original price of 8.5 yuan in and 9.5 yuan out, regardless of the version, but there were also those who exchanged at 8.2 yuan in and 8.7 yuan out. The price of gold ornaments on the street in exchange for silver dollars was as high as 44 yuan and 49 yuan.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The nickel coin market remained weak, mainly because transactions were scarce and there were few foreign customers absorbing them. Street vendors were also sparse. Twenty-cent coins fell to 210,000, 170,000, and ten-cent coins retreated to 60,000, 80,000. Five-cent coins were in short supply and sales were sluggish, shouted at 20,000, 40,000, down another 10,000 to 20,000 from the previous day.

### Rice Prices Rise Again

Although the actual sales of rice are not smooth, the prices have risen again because the arrival of goods is extremely small and there are few fake products in the market. The market management committee has once again strictly stipulated that transactions must be priced in gold yuan, and each commodity must exceed 30 million. White japonica rice in the Nanshi market was 34 million yuan, and thin indica rice was 34.8 million, both up more than 4 million. White japonica and thin indica rice in the Beishi market were both 31 million yuan, but transactions were very sluggish. 135 dan of goods arrived in the Nanshi market yesterday.

Grains

Due to the decline in silver dollars, they also fell in line. Yellow soybeans had few outlets, and Jiujiang winter soybeans fell to 12 million, a decrease of 3 million per dan. Picked green beans fell by 6 million, and corn also saw a decline. Yangzhou raw oil opened at 30.8 million, and Jiujiang sesame opened at 20 million. Each commodity opened slightly.

Flour

Returned to a downward trend, because gold, paper money, and silver dollars all declined. Holders took profits when prices were high, and the market was oversupplied. Prices generally fell. Bingchuan opened at 720,000 in the morning, once falling to 690,000, and scattered investors slightly absorbed at the close, rising back to 710,000. Lao Che retreated to 7.51 million. Bran has not yet opened.

Factory soybean oil surged by more than 20%, reaching a peak of 100 million yuan. Raw oil was in short supply and most popular, surging by more than 30%. The factory opening price exceeded the 100 million yuan mark. Raw and cooked rapeseed oil each rose by about 10%. Soybean cake did not open.

### Cotton Yarn Prices Fall Across the Board; Fabric Market Sales Are Not Lonely

Cotton yarn prices fell across the board yesterday due to sluggish actual sales and depressed sentiment. The off-site gold market situation was ordinary, and each gang had more selling than buying. There were only shouted prices in the market without any transactions. 42s Blue Phoenix was shouted at 760 million, down another 60 million. 40s Blue Phoenix was shouted at 740 million, also down 60 million. 32s Silver Moon was 570 million, and 21s Double Horse spot was shouted at 510 million, with the warehouse receipt at 460 million. Prices for 20s and below fell across the board.

Fine fabrics were selling well in the cotton fabric market. Affected by gangs of single buyers from various places bringing goods, sporadic sales were still not lonely. After the counter gang opened, they absorbed a lot. At 9:15, when shouting prices were made, the market was full of buying voices, and the prices rose all the way. The leading fine fabric rose from 17.8 million to a high price of 18.6 million. Wufu fine fabric initially made 15.2 million, and then shouted up 1 million yuan. The industry searched for low-end fine fabrics. Da Shuanglong fine fabric rose steadily from 14.8 million to 15.6 million, and San Tao fine fabric actually made a high price of 15.8 million. Umbrella bleached fabric was squeezed up to 3.6 million.

Near the close, due to profit-taking, there was a slight pullback. The midday close for Longtou fine fabric was 18.2 million, up 1.2 million. Four Gentlemen Serge was 19 million, up 1.6 million. Wufu Longtou fine fabric was 16 million, and Laba Tong was 16.4 million, with low-priced goods rising more.

Yesterday's rayon market situation was cold and weak, because the China Trust Bureau's allotment was repeated, the supply source was relatively abundant, and people's hearts were softened.

### Viewing Guilin's Landscape in a Chaotic World

— Zhang Ming

[Guilin, 2nd Day] Spring arrives late in the Lingnan region. Coupled with the incessant rain of the past month, the Solitary Beauty Peak is always shrouded in silvery mist. There hasn't been any sun here for a long time, and people are still wearing coats. Friends who have just returned from Guangzhou bring news that people by the sea are already experiencing high summer, which is bound to make those hibernating in winter envious! Fortunately, the first spring thunder resounded a few nights ago, bringing spring to Guilin from the darkness. Many people who have been tormented by life breathe a sigh of relief and shout: "Winter is over, isn't spring here?"

These days, Guilin is filled with the breath of spring. The footsteps of spring come in great strides - in the cheers of children, in the smiles of old farmers, and in the enthusiastic anticipation of many more people.

From the shores of the lake, Crescent Moon Mountain, and along the Peach Blossom River, pairs of young students can't contain the boundless spring, humming those alluring sentences: "Spring brings us intoxicating warm winds, blowing flower-like dreams..."

Guilin, enjoying the reputation of "the finest landscape under heaven" for over a thousand years, how could it not arouse the yearning of more people at this time? I once explained to a friend the "lovable aspects of Guilin's landscape" - a similar difficult question. The reason is: "The landscape here is lovable not because of its shape, but because of its color. I don't think any landscape is magnificent or uniquely exquisite, but it is those things wrapped in her, hidden under a thin quilt, those faint, cool, and vibrantly green new clothes."

Friends who know how to enjoy "Guilin's landscape" don't choose sunny days, but prefer to select times of misty rain. Only by viewing Guilin's landscape in the rain can one truly gain the "secret of unique enjoyment."

Recently, although the "annoying" rain has been drizzling intermittently, those with refined tastes still seek out the mountains and waters as usual. Their discoveries are "not for the common man to know." At this time, climbing high into an open pavilion, what greets you is a mountain mist and rain, a river of empty emerald. Who would still think of war? Think of slaughter? Originally, green is somewhat symbolic of peace, just as white symbolizes purity, yellow symbolizes decline, and red symbolizes enthusiasm. Looking at green, people naturally think of fertile fields and quiet villages, and can completely entrust a pure heart to that boundless green shadow.

Before the war, most of the mountains surrounding Guilin city could not be climbed for distant views. During the war, many mountain roads were opened up due to military needs. Today - after the war, it has become much more convenient for many "refined people." Like Elephant Trunk Hill, this "southern China barrier," one can now easily climb the steps to the top. At the same time, it is closest to the city and the road is wide, so it attracts the most tourists. Those who enjoy Elephant Trunk Hill are best advised to go down along the elephant's neck and nose. If you are brave enough, you might as well lower yourself to the river beach, walking barefoot on the exposed small black stones, with moss stains dyeing your toes, which is of course a different kind of fresh taste. And if you take a small boat, the cold, green river water seeps into your sleeves, a sound of oars, a sound of sandbars, whistling past. If accompanied by the rain peaks and the Xiao flute's rain melody, the feeling at this time, the misty rain of Purple Continent, is truly worth experiencing.

Despite the beacon fires raging in the northern sky and prices soaring, those "seeking spring" don't care about the strike of the Zhou-Gui-Qian Railway and the Western University's tuition. Many are taking advantage of the spring tide and going on outings in the suburbs. However, the pity is: no one thinks of using the carrying pole of a wonton vendor to sit, in that fresh yellow rape flower field, guessing with dice while warming wine, only leaving Shen Sanbai and Chen Yunniang to be beautiful in the past. It can be seen that modern people are still much more vulgar than the refined people of the past. Those men and women dressed in red and green, side by side, whispering and muttering, who knows if they are really seeking spring? Or do they have another "intention, like the old drunkard"?

After Qingming, a friend went to sweep tombs and sought an oracle at the "Longevity Buddha" on Crescent Moon Mountain for "profit," randomly drawing a "peace slip," which said well: "Enemies seeking revenge, tolerance will naturally cease, tolerate and there will be no trouble, fighting brings worry."

Don't imitate the predecessors like this: "The beauty of spring is hard to resist, the wine cup is often shallow, and new and old hatreds intertwine, the wind at the fifth watch, a thousand miles of dreams, seeing a few petals of flying red, such a courtyard..." In the courtyard, it is ultimately inevitable to collect sighs from now on. Quite a few people are living through hardships, they have forgotten spring. Spring has left people - it is very, very far from that many unfortunate people...

### The City of Import Surplus: Fuzhou

— Chuan Ping

[Fuzhou, 26th Day] Many soldiers have appeared on the streets of Fuzhou, and ten-wheeled military trucks are speeding through the narrow streets of Fuzhou, occasionally swallowing up pedestrians and rickshaws. Small tanks are even lined up in the public stadium. Even the most foolish people know that Fuzhou is changing. She was originally the most gentle and peaceful maiden, but now she has been disguised as a warrior, but in her heart there is only one idea: "Love peace." Although appearance may not be able to change the internal inclination, strong external forces often achieve some effect. Fuzhou is changing.

What Fuzhou citizens are most concerned about is not the future destiny, but the crazy prices that constantly threaten their survival. Prices are like water levels. When prices rise in one place, other places are bound to be affected. Fuzhou is different from southern Fujian. It seems to be less interfered with by the markets of Hong Kong and Guangdong. Leading Fuzhou prices is the Shanghai market. Just open the Shanghai newspaper and look at the market situation column, and you can know the general situation of Fuzhou prices. However, Fuzhou prices maintain a certain limit of difference from Shanghai prices. Comparing the market prices of the two places on the same day, Fuzhou is still relatively cheaper, and it seems that life in Fuzhou should be easier. However, the reality is not so. Because Fuzhou is a city with a trade surplus, Fuzhou has no large factories. Apart from the chimney of an electricity company, it is impossible to find a second factory with a chimney. Labor is particularly cheap in Fuzhou, and many people have to leave the province to work. The family members who remain in Fuzhou rely on the money sent back. However, it costs 350 yuan in handling fees to remit 1,000 yuan from Beijing and Shanghai to Fuzhou, and after many transfers, by the time a remittance is delivered to the family, it has been devalued to a pitiful extent. Therefore, Fuzhou prices seem cheaper than those in Beijing and Shanghai, but most Fuzhou citizens live an extremely difficult life.

In all fairness, Fuzhou is still considered lucky. Some time ago, due to the limited funds of the banks, the money market was tighter, and the rampant speculation was not too fierce. The Yixu Airport is being repaired, and flights on all routes have not landed here for two weeks. Due to the lack of funds, Fuzhou prices have been unable to rise. Even the prices of cloth and other items are slightly cheaper than those in Shanghai. This phenomenon of the market price in the sales area being lower than the market price in the production area is naturally only temporary, but it is not bad for the citizens to be able to catch their breath at this time. A tight money market is naturally a serious blow to some people who intend to stir up trouble in the market. When the Provincial Senate was in session, one senator even proposed asking the Central Bank to move a printing press to Fuzhou to solve the shortage of banknotes. It is rumored that the Central Bank's Fujian-Taiwan regional bank, which is about to be established in Rongcheng, will bring a printing press to supply the logistical expenses of the large army in Fujian. Although the banknote printing press has not arrived, the promissory note printing press has already started printing day and night. A few days ago, public education personnel were paid supplementary salaries and allowances for March according to the new treatment, and prices immediately rose by a factor of one in a few hours. The value of gold, silver and Yuan heads has increased a hundredfold, and the price of rice has also followed suit. The economic theory that the value of money is determined by the quantity of money has been most accurately proven here.

Although the prices in stores have begun to be based on gold bullion, what ordinary citizens are most concerned about is not the price of gold, but the price of rice. The people take food as their heaven, who can live without eating? Moreover, the price of gold is more or less affected by other financial markets in the country, while the price of rice, in addition to rising proportionally when the price of gold soars, the situation of its own supply and demand forms another reason for price changes. Fujian was originally a grain-deficient province. Before the war, it needed foreign rice. During the war, it relied on accumulated grain and Jiangxi rice to get through some days. After the war, foreign rice still did not come, so it had to rely on Jiangxi rice again, and Jiangxi rice needed to be exchanged for Fujian salt. After the victory, Jiangxi no longer needed to rely solely on the Fujian market for the salt it needed, and Fujian salt was not as popular in Jiangxi Province as it was during the war, so the grain supply in Fujian was deeply affected. A month ago, it was rumored that the Economic Cooperation Administration had agreed to include Fuzhou and Xiamen in the allocation area for American aid food, and the municipal authorities were preparing to ration food according to population on April 1. Just as the citizens of Fuzhou were celebrating, news came that American food had no intention of visiting Fuzhou. In the blink of an eye, the period of scarcity has arrived, let's see if we can make rice-less cooking!

In addition to the white terror, Fuzhou citizens are also worried about floods and the plague. Last year, the unprecedented floods caused a major disaster. Now everyone's hopes seem to be pinned on the Fuzhou Port Authority, which is about to be established, hoping that it can use dredgers to deepen the waterways at the mouth of the sea, so that the downstream can be smoothly discharged and floods may be avoided. Recently, the plague has been discovered in the Xiannan Road area of the city. The authorities are advising citizens to step up rat extermination, but what is coming will eventually come. Between spring and summer, Fuzhou will once again be shrouded in a terrifying atmosphere of plague. This year, who will be on the plague god's blacklist?

### Record of Grievances and Gratitude in Great Liang Mountain (Part 1)

Perilous obstacles are linked like stone passes, stretching far and controlling Shu
A partial army is repeatedly defeated, and senior generals repeatedly fail to conquer
The moon is cold in the land of the Black Barbarians, the frost is cold in Meng Huo's city
Beacon fires have not yet subsided, the sound of the night watchman's clapper startles many times

The Yi ethnic representative delegation brought unique songs and dances to the people of Beijing and Shanghai the year before last. The drama "Record of Grievances and Gratitude in Great Liang Mountain," which has recently been performed in various places, has also given people an unforgettable mountain atmosphere. Now, a living Record of Grievances and Gratitude in Great Liang Mountain is being staged in the Ning-Shu area, and tens of thousands of Yi compatriots are fighting each other on the banks of the Dadu River. The place where Zhuge Liang captured Meng Huo seven times in the past, the place where the partial army of King Yi Shi Dakai was defeated, is now once again filled with beacon fires.

This war was caused by the dispute over the "Ning-Shu Border Pacification Commander," and it began to deteriorate in February this year. Now the fighting is even more intense. In addition to Deng Deliang and Sun Fang, who are competing for the "Commander" position, each having two regiments of Yi soldiers and Han generals, He Guoguang, the commander of the Xichang Garrison, is preparing to transfer the 163rd Division of the National Army to join the battle to help Sun Fang suppress Deng Deliang. No one knows when this wild and desolate land will be peaceful again!

The so-called "Ning-Shu" refers to the eight counties and one administrative bureau that were transferred from southern Sichuan when Xikang Province was established. Because Xichang was formerly known as Ningyuan Prefecture, the subordinate counties are eight (Xichang, Huili, Yuejun, Mianning, Yanyuan, Yanbian, Ningnan, Zhaojue) and one administrative bureau (Ningdong). In addition, there are sixteen political districts, bordering Wumeng in the east, Yanjiang in the west, the Jinsha River in the south, and the Dadu River in the north, stretching for more than a thousand miles. Among them, there are towering ridges, deep mountains and rushing waters, towering peaks, and the blue of Qiongchi. The plains are fertile and rich in minerals, and the land is located at the intersection of Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan and Guizhou, and the meeting of the Le-Xi and Xi-Xiang highways, which is an important town in the southwest. The Xichang Garrison Headquarters, He Guoguang, deputy director of the Chongqing Pacification Office, concurrently serves as the commander and is stationed here.

This area has beautiful waters and green mountains, and Han and Yi people live together. It is estimated that together with the uncivilized Black Yi people who are deeply hidden in the Great Liang Mountain and Xiao Xiangling Mountains and forests, there are a total of 1.6 million Yi people. To deal with these more than one million Yi people with varying degrees of civilization, we have always relied on the armed forces of the Border Pacification Headquarters. The armed forces of the Border Pacification Department were created single-handedly by the old Commander Deng Xiuyan. He was originally a Han Chinese, and went deep into the Yi area alone and created this world. The people most admired by the Yi people are Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, followed by Commander Deng Xiuyan of Lugu and General Yang Ren'an of Fulin. The former controls the Yi people with power rather than virtue, and the latter with virtue rather than power. Deng Xiuyan established such a stable and autocratic regime in the Yi area of Ning-Shu with real knives and guns for decades. The dispute arose in August 1944, after his death, over the inheritance of "imperial power."

After Deng Xiuyan's death, He Guoguang's view on Yi affairs was: "The crown prince is young, Empress Lu is昏庸 (muddle headed and incompetent), not allowed to interfere in politics, and the sub-father is loyal and righteous, and can be entrusted with regency." (He Guoguang's telegram to Liu Wenhui). Today's situation is precisely the struggle between Empress Lu, who is holding the crown prince, and the sub-father.

The "crown prince," Deng Deliang, is 23 years old this year. After his father died, he inherited the position of Ning-Shu Border Pacification Commander at the age of only 19. The power was controlled by his birth mother, Deng Lv Xian. Old Mrs. Deng is already over 60 years old this year. She is gloomy, capable, and fierce. When her husband was alive, she already controlled the power of life and death over the Yi people. No one is not afraid of mentioning Old Mrs. Deng. After her husband died, she became even more unscrupulous and constantly squeezed the Yi people. Although Deng Xiuyan ruled the Yi people with power, he ultimately combined leniency and severity. Old Mrs. Deng only knew greed, so she was deeply dissatisfied by the Yi people. Three years ago, she instigated her son to kill a Yi leader of Tuowu for no reason, which led to widespread dissatisfaction among the Han and Yi people in Ning-Shu. Deng Deliang was then forced to go out and went to the Nanjing Infantry Specialist School with his uncle to receive training. The military power was then completely in the hands of Sun Fang, the deputy commander of the Border Pacification Department.

Sun Fang is the sub-father (Yi people) referred to by He Guoguang. He is the sworn brother of the old commander. In those years, he accompanied Deng Xiuyan on southern and northern expeditions and made many military exploits. He was appointed as the deputy commander of the Border Pacification Department. Although he is over 60 years old, he is open-minded and progressive, and is deeply supported by the Yi people. When he attended the first National Assembly two years ago, he led the Yi tourism delegation to Beijing and Shanghai to observe, and was deeply trusted by Liu Wenhui, chairman of Xikang Province, and He Guoguang, commander of the Xichang Garrison. Therefore, He Guoguang praised him as loyal and righteous and could be entrusted with regency.

After Deng Deliang graduated from the Beijing Infantry School last year, he was officially appointed as the Ning-Shu Border Pacification Commander, his uncle was also appointed as the commander of the Yi regiment, and another classmate named Xiao, who graduated from the military academy, was appointed as the chief of staff. The Ning-Shu area was shaken by this order. The Yi people were greatly shocked to see this young master return to power. At this time, Sun Fang was in Nanjing. Seeing that his nephews were being given such important tasks, he expressed his unwillingness to return. However, Liu Wenhui and He Guoguang could not lose him and urged him repeatedly before he returned to Xichang. This is the reason why he stayed in Chengdu and Chongqing for a long time without returning.

Before Sun Fang returned to Xichang, he had a conversation with Liu Wenhui in Chengdu, so soon the Ministry of National Defense issued another order appointing Sun Fang as the acting commander of the Ning-Shu Border Pacification Department, and Deng Deliang was transferred to be the commander of the Yi regiment. How could Deng Deliang, who had just returned from studying in Kyoto and was ambitious, be willing to accept this? The stubborn Old Mrs. Deng was even more unwilling, so she secretly gathered old troops and prepared to fight. Sun Fang had also heard of this long ago and deployed troops to wait.

After brewing like this for several months, the local people repeatedly mediated without success. It happened that the newly appointed director of the Chongqing Pacification Office, Zhang Qun, took office, and He Guoguang was invited to Chongqing to discuss the Southwest Plan. Deng Deliang believed that the time was ripe, so in February this year, in Lugu, the old nest of his father, he automatically took the position of "Border Pacification Commander" and ordered the "suppression" of Sun Fang. One section of his "Message to the Elders of Ning-Shu" says:

### Deng Deliang Tells the Elders: Plundering the Shabaz in Xichang

"::Deliang is loved by the local people and commended by the military and political leaders. Without being a mediocre talent, Liang is entrusted with a great responsibility. He inherited the legacy of his post for four years. Every time I think of the lack of talent, I am afraid of failing the expectations of the local people. Therefore, I invited Mr. Sun Fang, who had a deep friendship with my father for half his life, to come out and help, so that he could be effective.承 (Cheng) Sun Fang agreed, and solemnly stated that he would thoroughly maintain it to repay my father's friendship in his life, so I am grateful and cannot help but weep. Since then, I have trusted everything and never doubted it. Therefore, I handed over the entire Border Pacification armed force created by my father to him to be fully responsible:::During the period when Deliang was studying, he suddenly became ambitious and intended to take over the Border Pacification armed force that my father had painstakingly built as his own."

### Two Hundred Northern Orphans Are About to Run Out of Food Jiangsu Orphanage Appeals to All Sectors for Relief

To the Shanghai Shen Bao Office: Our hospital was originally located in Xuzhou and housed and educated orphans of resistance and disaster-stricken children who were poor and helpless. After the Xubang battle last year, we were ordered to move south. Because we were blocked by the war on the way, more than 200 refugee children walked to Nanjing for five days under heavy artillery fire, and then to Songjiang, suffering from hunger and cold. After arriving in Songjiang, we first encountered the cabinet moving to Guangzhou, followed by the merger of the Ministry of Social Affairs. After the breakdown of the peace talks, many local gentry also went to other places in response to the changes. The funding for our hospital was cut off, and we could not borrow money. We had no choice but to take a military vehicle to Shanghai at the end of last month, begging for food and sleeping in the open for five days. Thanks to the assistance of the Children's Welfare Promotion Association and the Relief Association, we have a temporary place to shelter from the wind and rain. However, the children are now eating thin porridge twice a day without any vegetables. If this continues, they will inevitably suffer from malnutrition, and the consequences will be unimaginable. Moreover, after suffering for half a year, more than 200 young lives are already exhausted. We believe that your museum can provide assistance to this group of northern orphans. Therefore, we specially send a letter to appeal to philanthropists from all walks of life to show the great sympathy of mankind and help our hospital in its urgent need. We will be extremely grateful!

### Landlord Forcing Eviction Writer Has Nowhere to Live

Mr. Editor: I am a reader of your newspaper and have been engaged in writing for many years. In the past, I have also submitted my humble manuscripts, and I have been fortunate enough to have them published one by one, which I consider to be a pleasure in my life. Recently, my lease has expired, and I have been forced by the landlord to move out. One master and one servant have nowhere to live. Therefore, I urgently need to solicit cultural figures who have spare houses near Fuxing Park or Linsen Park to seek to solve the difficulty of living. If we can borrow one large and one small room based on the meaning of mutual appreciation, we can write with peace of mind, how fortunate! If there are homeowners who need to leave Shanghai urgently, I am also willing to take responsibility for taking care of the house on their behalf in return for their kindness. I take the liberty of entrusting you. I don't know if you can publish this letter? If there are letters in response, please ask your column to collect and forward them, I would be very grateful! With best wishes, Reader Zhao Ming

### Lost and Found Banknotes

To Whom It May Concern: I work at the British Shanghai Waterworks Company and am responsible for collecting accounts. Yesterday morning, when I was busy at work, a customer found a stack of banknotes unclaimed on the counter and handed it to me for safekeeping. Until 5 pm, no one had come to claim it. I don't know who the loser is. I am deeply afraid that the original owner is a wage earner, and the loss of this large sum of money will have a significant impact. I am specially publishing this notice to find the owner so that the owner can claim it in time. Sincerely, Deng Bingyi, reader of the Shen Bao, May 8.
