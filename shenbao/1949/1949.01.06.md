### United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie Announces Study of Current Situation in China and Considers Possibility of Mediation for Peace Talks

[Our Dispatch] Lake Success, New York, 5th Radio: United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie stated in a press conference that he would "consider" what methods could be used to intervene in the Chinese war. He will study whether the United Nations can find a way to peacefully resolve the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party. Lie stated that he would consider the possibility of the United Nations mediating to promote peace in China. Lie also expressed his belief that peace would come to Palestine in 1949 and that a general resolution of the Holy Land dispute would be closer than ever before. However, Lie declined to comment on the renewed hostilities between Jews and Egyptians. Regarding the China issue, Lie solemnly stated that he must first "study" the overall picture of the Chinese war, which has not yet been considered an international issue and is therefore not within the purview of the United Nations. Lie said, "I don't know how to stop the war in China," particularly emphasizing the word "I," and added, "Perhaps I will consider this issue." When a reporter asked if it was possible for the United Nations to mediate and bring the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party closer to reconciliation, he replied, "I will answer this question at the next meeting." Some of Lie's deputies said that Lie had not yet given serious consideration to the China issue, and one of them believed that Lie might conclude that the United Nations should not interfere in the China issue. It was pointed out that if the war in China was secretly directed or aided by a country other than China, then the President's government would have already brought the matter to the United Nations for processing.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 5th] A spokesperson for the Soviet Embassy here denied on the 5th the claims in Chinese newspapers that Soviet Ambassador to China, Roshchin, would return to Moscow in the near future to discuss matters with the government.

Chinese Communist Party Avoids Direct Reply, Radio Broadcast Rejects Peace Talks

[Our Dispatch] New York, 5th Radio: Nanjing News, the Chinese Communist Party radio station has directly rejected the peace proposals made by President Chiang on New Year's Eve last year, and boasts that the Communist Party is approaching final victory. The radio station explained that the meaning of its so-called final victory is: "Completely destroying the Kuomintang reactionary elements and driving the American imperialist invading forces out of China." The radio station ridiculed President Chiang's claim that the Chinese government still has superior strength compared to the Communist Party. Although previous Communist Party broadcasts had rejected the government's peace hints, this broadcast was the first time that the Communist Party directly mentioned President Chiang's message. Although the Communist Party has dimmed the government's hope of convening peace talks, this cannot yet be considered the Communist Party's official reply. The advocates for peace in Sun Ke's cabinet still hope that they can achieve a ceasefire through continued efforts and establish a coalition government in which both the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party participate. There are currently no signs of what President Chiang's next move will be.

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 5th Radio: As of the 5th, the Chinese Communist Party had not made a direct reply to President Chiang's New Year's Day message. However, in its broadcasts, it has been continuously repeating the New China News Agency's New Year's Day editorial every day since January 2nd. In the news broadcasts on the 4th and 5th, it used a New China News Agency reporter's commentary to launch a fierce attack on President Chiang's message, accusing the government's willingness to talk about peace as a conspiracy planned by the United States and the Kuomintang, attempting to preserve American privileges and the vested interests of bureaucrats in China, and waiting for an opportunity to rest before staging a comeback. It also stated that the people in Peiping and Shanghai were very indifferent to the President's message.

### Sun Ke Reports on the Issue of War and Peace in the Political Affairs Meeting, Zhang Zhizhong's Wife Sings in Harmony, Believing Their Combined Efforts Will Contribute to Achieving Peace

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 5th] Premier of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, presided over the Political Affairs Meeting on the morning of the 5th, and reported on the issue of war and peace, and explained the origins of the President's New Year's Day message. It is said that this report is intended to be used as a reference in formulating the new cabinet's administrative policies. In addition, Minister of Foreign Affairs Wu Tiecheng and Minister of National Defense Xu Yongchang also reported on foreign affairs and military affairs, respectively.

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 5th] The 5th was the fifth day after the publication of the President's New Year's message. The political atmosphere in the capital remained calm. The weather was sunny and cold, and the markets were as usual. People from all walks of life were still awaiting the Chinese Communist Party's response to the government's desire for peace with extreme concern. Regarding the fact that the Chinese Communist Party was slow to make a direct statement on the peace issue, a few people seemed impatient, while some people thought it was a good sign. However, the vast majority remained silent and observant, and believed that the Communist Party's unofficial criticisms, such as the New China News Agency's short commentary and its reporter's commentary on President Chiang's message, could not be conclusively regarded as the Communist Party's official attitude. An authoritative person told reporters on the morning of the 5th that the door to peace was still wide open, and those who had confidence, hope, and loved the people would eventually succeed, and that the attainment of peace would especially depend on the sincerity of all those who were enthusiastic about national affairs. The person pointed out that the fact reported in the Associated Press reporter Ji Ang's dispatch from Peiping, "Reflections of Peace on the Front Lines," was extremely important, because the people of the whole country hoped for peace in order to have enough food and clothing, and even the soldiers on the front lines were tired of the war, and considerations of combat ideals were secondary. Today, the need for peace is truly undeniable, and he personally speculated that the Chinese Communist Party would not go against the will of the people. The reason why they had not made a direct statement may be that the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party had not yet reached a resolution on some concrete matters, which had to be delayed. He stated that he was not an optimist, but that there was no reason for pessimism in the current situation, and he emphasized that the government was determined to win peace for the people, so there was much that could be done. He hinted that Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, and Chiang Ching-kuo would all make significant contributions to the attainment of peace. When a reporter asked whether the government had considered sending Zhang and Shao to the Communist areas to negotiate peace, he replied that he himself did not know whether the government had considered this, but that if Zhang and Shao were working for the country and the people, they would have the courage to prepare to accept such a mission. As for the possibility of international mediation, he said that the only ally of China could do more than other countries, and the government would not ignore the assistance of this friendly country.

### Zhang Lan's Talk with Foreign Reporters Believes Hopes for Peace are Slim, Hopes Chinese Communist Party Does Not Obey the Policies of the Cominform

[Gao Erya, Chief of the China Branch of the Associated Press, Dispatch from This City] Zhang Lan, former chairman of the Democratic League, met with reporters alone on the 5th and predicted that the Chinese Communist Party would not accept the government's peace proposals. In addition, the Chinese Communist Party also believes that it has gained the upper hand in both military and political aspects. The 77-year-old chairman of the Democratic League said: "The Communist Party may completely ignore the government's proposals. They will also say no, but they will never say yes. Everyone hopes for peace, but I think the hope is very slim. There are two conditions proposed by Chiang Kai-shek that are particularly unacceptable. Not to mention the Communist Party, but the general public feels this way. These two are the requirements for the succession of the government and the maintenance of the status quo of the people." As for Zhang's current position in the government's offensive, he denied all rumors that he had gone north to participate in the new Political Consultative Conference.

However, Zhang confirmed that several Democratic League members active in Hong Kong had left Hong Kong and gone north to hold a new Political Consultative Conference with the Chinese Communist Party. He revealed that two of them were Shen Junru and Zhang Bojun. Zhang Lan said that he had no intention of holding office in any future government. He said that he had heard that Li Jishen, who went north, had a great possibility of participating in the organization of a coalition government.

When asked whether the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party were authentic Chinese communists or followers of the Cominform, Zhang replied that he thought they belonged to the former. However, he also indirectly stated that if the Chinese Communist Party attempted to drag China into a vortex and fight for world communism, then the ideas and organizations he represented would oppose it. Zhang said: "I have not been to the Communist areas, so I can only express some of the experiences I have seen from Mao Zedong's book "New Democracy." This book seems to be based on Sun Yat-sen's proposition. If Mao Zedong does this book, he is a Chinese nationalist, not an international communist." Regarding Mao's criticism of Yugoslav Marshal Tito, Zhang said that this was the Cominform line, but then said: "I saw the message in the newspaper, but I still don't understand his motives. I don't know if this is an expression to the Cominform. However, I hope that Mao Zedong will adhere to the ideals in "New Democracy" and not obey the policies of the Cominform." He meant that if the Chinese Communist Party abandoned one-country communism and became a part of global communism, then it would be difficult for the Chinese Communist Party to gain the support of the people. When asked if publishing everything he told the reporter in this city would be detrimental to him, Zhang replied: "If it is interpreted correctly, there is no problem." When asked if his actions were restricted after the Democratic League was banned, Zhang smiled and said: "I always think of going to other places."

### Taiyuan Defense Enters New Stage

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 5th] The Taiyuan Defense War has entered a new stage. According to a military official who told reporters: After suffering repeated defeats in its military and political offensives, the Communist bandits have recently been besieging us for a long time, and their conspiracy has also been shattered.

The bandits' heavy weapons and front-line soldiers have now been forced to retreat one after another, and several batches of soldiers surrender to us with their weapons every day. This is certainly due to the heroic search and suppression by our military and civilians, and the inspiration of our army's shouts on the front lines. It is also a clear proof of the bandits' heavy casualties and low morale. This phenomenon is particularly evident in the southeast. Our army has formed an extremely strong line of defense that can be attacked at any time. The collapse of the bandits is approaching.

### Tianjin's Periphery Tightens: Intense Artillery Battles Occurred from the Night Before to This Morning; Air Force Active Over Ancient Tianjin-Tanggu

Editorial

### Looking Ahead to the 81st U.S. Congress

The Eightieth Congress, deemed by President Truman as the second worst in American history, became a thing of the past on December 31st of last year. Subsequently, the Democratic-controlled Eighty-First Congress commenced on the 3rd. This will inevitably lead to fresh decisions regarding America's national agenda. Amidst global turmoil and America's hesitant stance, the inauguration of the Eighty-First Congress holds profound significance for both the United States and the world at large. As Reuters correspondent Hart Cussell noted, "The commencement of the Eighty-First U.S. Congress on January 3rd marks a major event in American history, with the capacity to impact the lifestyles of two billion men and women globally, including China."

Throughout President Roosevelt's New Deal era, both houses of the U.S. Congress remained under Democratic control for over a decade, a rare phenomenon in American political history. However, following the conclusion of World War II, partial elections were held for both houses. Due to voter fatigue with prolonged Democratic rule and their expectations for the Republican Party, the Republicans ultimately gained a majority in both houses, securing 243 seats against 185 in the House of Representatives and 51 seats against 45 in the Senate, thus overwhelming the Democrats. This placed the Eightieth Congress entirely under Republican control, leading to constant obstruction of the Democratic Truman administration. Although a "bipartisan" policy was formed in foreign affairs, domestic policy almost entirely opposed Roosevelt's New Deal. Consequently, the Eightieth Congress was widely rejected by the American people. In the elections of last November, not only did President Truman defeat his formidable opponent, Dewey, to secure re-election, but the Democratic Party also surpassed the Republican Party in both houses of Congress, achieving a majority and marking a miracle in American political history. Currently, in the Eighty-First Congress, the Democrats hold 262 seats in the House of Representatives, far exceeding the Republican's 171 seats. With 54 Democratic senators compared to the Republican's 42, their advantage is also undoubtedly secure.

The Democratic Party's victory carries extraordinary significance for both the United States and the world. Consequently, people across the globe eagerly anticipate the opening of the new Congress, expecting that America will adopt new policies regarding its domestic and foreign affairs to reverse the global tide and embark once again on the path of peace. Therefore, the Eighty-First Congress faces numerous and challenging problems. In summary, the following four issues exist in foreign affairs: (1) The ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty; (2) The continuation of aid to Europe and China; (3) The increase or decrease of U.S. dollars required for the Marshall Plan; (4) The extension of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act. The following four major challenges also exist in domestic affairs: (1) The compilation of the national budget; (2) The resistance to inflation; (3) Social Security issues; (4) The safeguarding of civil rights.

The resolution of these issues is urgently needed at this moment. From a global perspective, America's most pressing task lies in the fundamental decision of its overall strategy. Fortunately, both Democratic leaders in the U.S. Congress, Connally and Rayburn, advocate maintaining a bipartisan foreign policy, believing that amidst global turmoil, they require an American foreign policy, not a Democratic or Republican one. Therefore, there may not be significant changes to the fundamental strategy. In the past year or two, America's every move, both domestically and internationally, has relied on the "Truman Doctrine" and the "Marshall Plan," both of which have "anti-communism and defense against the Soviet Union" as their core. In the past year, the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union reached its peak. In particular, the escalating Berlin dispute almost caused the Cold War to become heated, transforming into a real international war. Thinking about it today, it still causes lingering fear. However, we firmly believe that today America needs peace and does not want to see the world face another war at this time. Therefore, will there be other means to prevent the trend of the "Cold War" evolving into a hot war? Will there be further perfect implementation steps for the "Truman Doctrine" and the "Marshall Plan" in the future? This must be considered a serious question. The energetic Eighty-First Congress should carefully consider this and make wise choices.

Looking back at international politics in 1948, it is not difficult to find that America's approach to any international issue often contradicted itself. For example, it seemed to lack a "steadfast" policy regarding the Jewish-Arab conflict in Palestine and the Indonesian movement in the Dutch East Indies. Furthermore, the implementation of the "Truman Doctrine" differentiated between Europe and Asia, neglecting Asia and diminishing the significance of the "Truman Doctrine." The failure of the "Marshall Plan" to consider Asia is particularly incomprehensible. Therefore, we must urge American legislators to make supplementary decisions regarding America's fundamental strategy. Once a decision is made, it must be implemented with all efforts until the goal is achieved. Only in this way can America be the "big brother" of all countries in the world, and only in this way can America lead the world on the path to peace!

### Truman Reads Message at Joint Session of Senate and House; Calls for New Taxes and Price Controls; Expand Social Security Plan and Repeal Taft-Hartley Labor Act

[United Press, Washington, 5th] President Truman on the 5th asked the new Congress for $4 billion in increased taxes and authority to make price and wage controls part of the economic system "for the benefit of all the people." These requests were included in the State of the Union message, which President Truman personally presented at a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives, so that the 81st Congress could begin discussing its legislative program. At the same time, the president will begin his new term on January 20th. The president said that the increased tax revenue should initially come from corporations, and some may come from revising property and inheritance taxes. But he continued, "But an increase in the personal income tax rates for middle- and high-income individuals will also be considered." He said that these people benefited greatly from the tax cut bill passed by the 80th Congress last year, despite his veto. In addition to the tax increase, most of the points raised in the State of the Union message were repetitions of Truman's requests to the 80th Congress and his campaign platform. He called for the repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act, the establishment of an employer law, and the restoration of the old Wagner Labor Relations Act, but with revisions to curb illegal strikes, employer alliances against union workers, and shutdowns of major industries such as public utilities. The president also asked for the independent power to impose maximum wages and maximum prices and to ration scarce commodities that significantly affect major production or living expenses.

Diplomatic Focus on Seeking Peace

In his speech, Truman frankly discussed the theme of foreign policy. He said, "The center of our foreign policy is peace. We are supporting a world organization that maintains peace, and a world economic policy that creates prosperity. I recommend restoring the mutual trade agreement to its maximum effectiveness, and extending it for three years. We should also open our doors to immigrants without discrimination. We should now make it clear to all countries that we do not want to freeze the status quo, and we have no intention of insisting on past injustices. We welcome the constructive efforts made by many countries to improve the lives of their citizens. In the Economic Cooperation Administration, in our Good Neighbor Policy, and in the United Nations, we have begun to overturn the national boundaries that prevent the economic development and social progress of the world's people. We believe that if we firmly maintain the principles of international cooperation, we will in fact gain the support of countries that are now trying to weaken and overturn this plan. We are now standing at an era that may be of great achievement for us and all mankind, but it may also be of terrible disaster for us and all mankind." The president concluded by saying that he still intends to make further explanations to Congress in the future.

### Key Points of Truman's Message; One Million New Homes Should Be Built in the Next Seven Years; Hope to Approve Human Rights Law and Eliminate Racial Discrimination

The full text of the President's State of the Union message is as follows: "I am pleased to report to the 81st Congress that the Union is in good shape, and our country is even better able to meet the needs of the American people than before. We have abandoned the traditional concept of national prosperity. We believe that our economic system should be built on a democratic foundation, so that wealth should be created for the benefit of the public. In the recent election, it was shown that the American people approve of this kind of society and hope to continue to improve it. The private enterprise system has achieved new peaks of production. Agricultural production has increased by 45%, and industrial production has increased by 75%. This progress has greatly surprised the prophets at home and abroad who predicted the collapse of American capitalism. But because our shortcomings are expanding, we still feel that we have a long way to go.

We are suffering from excessively high prices, and our production is still not enough to meet the needs. Our minimum wage is still too low in all enterprises that cannot compete with monopoly enterprises, and farmers face an uncertain future. We are deeply concerned about the shortage of electricity, five million families still live in slums and fire shelters, and three million families live with other families. In many areas, our schools are still inadequate, and our democratic ideals are often frustrated by prejudice and intolerance. Our prosperity is being threatened by inflationary pressures, and the government must be able to take effective action to counter these many crises. Therefore, I propose the following legislative bills:

(1) Continue the power to regulate consumer credit and expand the power to regulate bank credit; (2) Authorize the government to restrict speculation and commodity exchange; (3) Continue the export control agency; (4) Continue the traffic priority allocation agency; (5) Authorize the priority allocation of scarce major materials; (6) Extend and strengthen rent control; (7) Authorize the establishment of maximum prices for scarce materials that have a fundamental impact on the production or cost of living of important industries, and restrict unreasonable wage adjustments that will undermine the established maximum prices. (8) Authorize immediate research into appropriate production facilities to alleviate this shortage, and at the same time, store extremely scarce raw materials such as steel. At the same time, when necessary, authorize the government to provide loans to expand production facilities and alleviate this shortage. If private enterprises cannot meet our needs, authorize the government to establish such production facilities.

Currently, workers are being unfairly discriminated against by a law that deprives them of their rights and restricts their constructive efforts. This law, sometimes referred to as the Taft-Hartley Act, should be repealed. The Wagner Act should be restored, but with certain improvements as needed. Illegal strikes and unfair employer alliances against union workers should be prohibited. The use of economic power to resolve issues arising from existing contracts should be prevented. The legally stipulated minimum wage should be increased to at least 75 cents per hour.

We must ensure the free opportunity for small businesses to develop normally. Therefore, we should strengthen the anti-trust law. Supporting agricultural product prices is an important part of our plan. The past support for agricultural product prices should be adopted to prevent continued price declines. Currently, the prices of agricultural products are clearly lagging behind general prices.

Congress should implement measures to lower rents, build public housing, and clear slums. I have repeatedly proposed this point. The number of low-rent public houses stipulated in the legislation should be increased to one million in the next seven years. I reiterate the human rights recommendations I made to the 80th Congress. These recommendations should be implemented so that the federal government can restore its leadership and assume the obligations clearly stipulated in the Constitution.

[Our News] Lake Success, New York, Broadcast on the 5th: United Nations Secretary-General Lie stated at a press conference that the Security Council will meet here on Friday morning, and said that if representatives of all member states cannot arrive on Friday, the Indonesian issue will be postponed to next Monday for discussion.

[Another Wire] Pakistani Foreign Minister Zafrullah Khan cabled the Security Council today, demanding that the Dutch troops immediately retreat to the border lines before the invasion of the Republic of Indonesia and release the captured Indonesian President Sukarno and others. It is claimed that the above two matters are necessary steps to uphold the authority of the United Nations and restore its lost dignity. The only basis for a peaceful resolution of the Indonesian issue is for both parties to negotiate on an equal footing, otherwise there will only be a complete break between the Netherlands and Indonesia, and they will forever be enemies.

### US Army Secretary's Visit to Europe Appreciated; Believes War Can Be Avoided Temporarily; Advocates Reducing Occupation Fees for Germany, Japan, and Korea

[United Press, Washington, 4th] Army Secretary Royall disclosed on the 4th that the government will request a total of $1.1 billion in occupation fees for Germany, Japan, and Korea for the next fiscal year from Congress, a decrease of $200 million from this year's figures. At the same time, the State Department announced that the United Kingdom and the United States have reached an agreement to continue the joint economic work in the British and American occupation zones in Germany until the end of March, at which time it is hoped that an agreement can be reached with France to turn the "dual occupation zone" into a "triple occupation zone." Royall's announcement was the first public statement regarding any major part of Truman's new budget proposal. The budget proposal will be submitted to Congress in the middle of next week. Royall said that of the $1.1 billion, the German portion is about $500 million and the Japanese portion is $600 million. The Japanese portion also includes the expenses for the Korean portion, but this only accounts for a small number, as the occupation forces stationed in Korea are currently decreasing. Royall also told reporters: (1) He still maintains his estimate from last autumn that war is not imminent. (2) During his recent trip to Western Europe, he obtained "a very positive impression that democratic forces are growing day by day. The determination to oppose communist infiltration is also becoming stronger." (3) The progress of German industrial recovery is "extremely satisfactory" and production has now increased.

### Soviet Union Accuses the United States in the Allied Control Council; Expanding Japanese Police Force; The US Lists Facts and Figures to Refute

[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] The Soviet Union accused the United States on the 5th in the 77th meeting of the Allied Control Council for Japan that the Japanese police, under the encouragement of the United States, are secretly being expanded into an army, but the United States quickly denied it. Soviet Representative Lieutenant General Derevyanko accused Japan of moving towards the goal of establishing an armed force of 300,000 people with the encouragement of the United States. Derevyanko warned that this move would give Japan a force equivalent to 17 infantry divisions, the same strength that Japan had five years before the Northeast Incident in 1931. He accused MacArthur's headquarters of encouraging this expansion without discussing it with the Allied Control Council and the Far Eastern Commission. Derevyanko said that according to statistics from various sources, Japan already has 141,206 police officers. In addition, Japan also has 10,000 maritime police and 22,000 easily mobilized railway police. He estimated that the current strength is 2.5 times the 56,000 that Japan retained at the time of surrender. He also accused the existence of so-called "secret police" activities, whose obvious goal is to deal with labor unions. US Representative Sebald replied immediately: "I am deeply surprised by the Soviet representative's statement. Obviously, I believe that the current Japanese police can never be built into an army." Sebald said that the number of police officers at the time of Japan's surrender in August 1945 was 130,809. The Soviet statement is completely inaccurate. As for the current total number of Japanese police officers, it is about 125,000, with only 25,000 pistols, which are mutually transferred, and the police who hold pistols are only issued an average of a few bullets. Most police officers only hold batons. Sebald also directly denied the existence of any "secret police activities," and said that the Soviet accusations against the maritime police and railway police were greatly exaggerated. British Commonwealth Representative Shaw supported the US position, believing that the current strength of the Japanese police is "nothing to fear."

### Our Representative Shang Zhen; Maintains Neutral Attitude; Believes the Number of New Police Should Be Limited

Chinese Representative General Shang Zhen maintained a neutral attitude and proposed "Allied vigilance." He recalled that the Japanese police would be used as a tool for Japan's military aggression plan, and said that the number of new police should be limited to the needs of maintaining public peace and order. If further increases are necessary, they should be strictly limited to this goal. The 80-minute meeting ended in failure after a heated debate because the US representative refused to accept the three points raised by the Soviet Union.

### Asian Conference May Form; Pan-Asian Political Group; British Support for the Netherlands May Be Forced to Change

[United Press, Washington, 4th] According to Southeast Asian observers, the future New Delhi conference on the 4th may develop into a pan-Asian "Nehruism." They said that Indian Prime Minister Nehru's convening of the conference to consider the Indonesian situation may establish a new regional political group in a world that has already been "blocked" by the East and the West.

One of the Indonesian representatives to the United Nations said that he hopes the New Delhi conference will be conducted within the framework of the United Nations. Its representative in Washington hinted that a Southeast Asian group may be formed in the short term. Nehru's invitation may be extended to the entire Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Australia.

[United Press, New York, 4th] One of the Indonesian representatives to the United Nations, Subito, believes that the attitude of the three countries of India, Australia, and New Zealand will make British policy on the Indonesian dispute take the opinions of these three countries as opinions. The United Kingdom's current attitude is to support the Netherlands against Indonesia, but India's threat to withdraw from the British Commonwealth, as well as Australia's and New Zealand's extreme fear of the Indonesian war, have caused British policy to change. Subito also said: Although we have unpleasant actions against the Indonesian Communist Party, the Soviet Union's policy still supports us unchanged. The Soviet Union's ability is consistent with its policy in China. The Soviet Union frankly hopes to destroy the Asian alliance.

### Israel Accepts U.S. Advice; Guarantees Withdrawal of Invading Troops from Egypt; Egypt Cables Security Council, Stating Condition for Ceasefire is Compliance with Order

It was disclosed that Israel had provided assurances that all Israeli troops had withdrawn from Egyptian territory. U.S. Special Envoy to Israel, MacDonald, submitted a note to the Israeli Foreign Ministry, reiterating the U.S. position.

The contents of the note have not yet been released. According to the State Department, the note was drafted with "the most friendly concern." At the same time, State Department Press Officer McDermott denied rumors that the U.S. had warned that Israel's actions might lead the U.S. to delay formal recognition of Israel and the inability to obtain a $100 million loan.

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 4th] The Egyptian government cabled the Security Council, restating its willingness to cease fire immediately, provided that the Jewish army also ceases fire at the same time, and stated that the Egyptian army is now only resisting the Jewish army's attacks in self-defense.

After Mayor Wu and Land Administration Bureau Director Zhu Ping repeatedly took the stage to explain, a resolution was finally reached, and the original proposal was passed.

The "Examination Report on the General Budget of Income and Expenditure for the 38th Year of the Republic" and the "Examination Opinions on the Policy Report" were generally passed due to lack of time.

### Gold and Silver Redemption Resumes Yesterday; Balancing Fee is 4,500 per Ounce; Silver Dollar Exchange Rate is 65 Yuan per Coin

[Reported by Our Newspaper] According to the regulations of the Executive Yuan on improving the redemption measures for gold yuan coupons, the National Bank has started to list balancing fees daily yesterday, taking into account the exchange rate of overseas remittances. Yesterday, in addition to the exchange price of 1,000 yuan and the deposit of 1,000 yuan per ounce of gold, an additional balancing fee of 4,500 yuan was added, totaling 6,500 yuan per ounce. The silver dollar is calculated at a ratio of 1% of the gold exchange price, and each silver dollar is equivalent to 65 yuan in gold yuan coupons. In this city, in addition to the National Bank, the Trust Department of the Bank of China, the Trust Department of the Bank of Communications, the Trust Department of the China Farmers Bank, the Postal Savings Bureau, the Trust Department of the Cooperative Bank, and the Xujiahui Office of the Cooperative Bank, all seven locations have resumed operations. The China Trust Bureau failed to open at the same time due to insufficient preparation, but it is expected to join today. The above seven locations processed applications and identity verification procedures within the specified time in the morning. The Shanghai Gold Control Bureau sent personnel to the accepting banks to monitor the processing. The National Bank issued a total of 396 application forms (originally scheduled for 400, but four were voided due to discrepancies between the photo and number on the applicant's identity card). The Bank of China issued 300 forms, and the Agricultural Postal Savings Bureau issued 100 forms each, and the Cooperative Bank issued 200 forms. All payment procedures for the application forms issued yesterday were completed on the same day, and the contracting bank issued a temporary receipt. The applicant for redemption will take the receipt along with their identity card and seal to the bank that issued the application form on the designated date to collect the gold and silver. In addition, since the resumption of redemption yesterday, whether public educators, employees, or ordinary citizens are handling redemption, they will all be charged a balancing fee in accordance with the improved measures, without exception. It is heard that the public educator personnel redemption handled by the Municipal Bank has been fully completed in advance. The section published in various newspapers yesterday that the Municipal Bank had separately scheduled the dates for various units to collect gold and silver from the 5th to the 12th was found to be inconsistent with the facts.

### Beijing-Shanghai Express Train Delayed; Narrowly Avoids Major Disaster at Suzhou Station

### Presidents of National Colleges and Universities in Shanghai Jointly Telegraph Ministry of Education to Resign

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The presidents of various national colleges and universities in this city held a meeting at the Sino-American Hospital yesterday afternoon. The attendees included Wang Zhiche of Jiaotong University, Zhang Yi of Fudan University, Li Shouyong of Jinan University, Xia Jianbai of Tongji University, Zhu Hengbi of Shanghai Medical College, Zhu Guozhang of Shanghai Business College, Dai Cuilun of Shanghai Conservatory of Music, and Zhou Junshi of Wusong Merchant Marine College. During the meeting, the presidents decided to jointly telegraph the Ministry to resign because the treatment of public educators and employees had not been adjusted. Under the current situation of high prices, the lives of professors and employees are difficult, and school funding is strained. Although they have repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Education to appeal, there has been no solution. The telegram is as follows:

Ministry of Education, Nanjing: National colleges and universities in the Shanghai area previously reported that the treatment of faculty and staff was meager, their lives were difficult, the public funding for students was too low to maintain meals, and operating expenses were strained, far from covering actual expenses, and requested your Ministry to provide relief as soon as possible. Many days have passed since then, and no instructions have been received. Now that the new year is beginning, the living allowance for January of the 38th year has not yet been allocated. In recent months, the prices of various public utilities in Shanghai have continued to increase, and other prices have also increased steadily. The monthly operating expenses are not enough to cover any one item of water, electricity, or fuel. The lives of professors, employees, and students are even more on the verge of starvation. We, Zhuo, etc., are in charge of school affairs and see our colleagues working on empty stomachs and students struggling to get enough to eat. We have no plan for relief and feel ashamed. At this time of national difficulty, we, Zhuo, etc., dare not shirk our responsibilities in the face of difficulties, but in this desperate situation, we are truly ashamed to cling to our positions. We dare to continue to telegram to report and respectfully request your approval to resign and promptly appoint other virtuous and capable people to take over. We are anxiously awaiting orders. Presidents of National Jiaotong University, National Fudan University, National Jinan University, National Tongji University, National Shanghai Medical College, National Shanghai Business College, National Shanghai Conservatory of Music, and National Wusong Merchant Marine College, together kowtow, Zi, Wei.

### Household Rice Ration Price for This Month Determined; 56.5 Yuan per Dou; Priority Ration Price 38 Yuan

The household rice ration price for January in this city was officially determined yesterday at the three-person price negotiation meeting to be 56.5 yuan per dou. Priority rationing for dependents of public educators and industrial workers will continue, with a price of 38 yuan per dou.

After an hour of serious discussion, the above decision was made, and it was stipulated that the rice for this ration would still be 15 catties per dou, with 12 catties of whole rice and 3 catties of broken rice per dou. All rice sources will be provided by the Emergency Purchasing and Storage Committee of the Ministry of Food. All of this rice is stored in the China Trust Bureau warehouse. Due to the New Year's holiday, the transportation to various rice shops has been delayed until today. The rice shops should sell it as soon as it arrives to meet the needs of the citizens.

### Municipal Industrial Association and Chamber of Commerce Jointly Telegraph Call for Peace

The Shanghai Municipal Industrial Association and the Chamber of Commerce jointly telegraphed the government and the Communist Party on the 4th, requesting an immediate ceasefire in the current location and the dispatch of representatives to continue negotiations. The original telegram stated: "To President Jiang of Nanjing, Vice President Li, the presidents and vice presidents of the Five Yuans, the members of the Executive Yuan, the members of the Control Yuan, the heads of various ministries, and the members of the Central Standing Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang: To Mr. Mao Zedong and Mr. Lin Zuhan in Yan'an, Mr. Li Renchao and Mr. Liao Chengzhi in Hong Kong, and forwarded to Mr. Zhu De, Mr. Peng Dehuai, Mr. Zhou Enlai, and Mr. Ye Jianying, and all members of the Chinese Communist Party: Since the end of the Second World War, countries that participated in the war have learned from the death and devastation of wartime and have been working on economic recovery and establishing five- or ten-year plans to remedy the losses. Even in Eastern and Western Europe, those in charge of state affairs only have different policies, but their love of peace and cherishing of the national foundation are the same. Only Greece, the earliest civilized country in Europe, suffered the invasion of Germany and Italy. After the war ended, it sought war again, and the patriots were deeply saddened. Our country's eight-year war of resistance, the area trampled by Japanese cavalry, almost exceeded half of the national territory. The intensity of the war was equal to that of Eastern Europe and far exceeded that of Western Europe. Unfortunately, the Political Consultative Conference failed, followed by war, facing each other far away, and followed in the footsteps of Greece. The scale of the destruction is far greater than that of Greece. The facts of the past few years are obvious and need not be elaborated. Our associations deeply understand the clear lessons of war and danger and the changes in modern tactics. The plane is three-dimensional, connected as one, and the rear and front are not distinguished. If we do not seek change, we are afraid that the modern industrial and commercial enterprises that have been carefully managed for decades and have a slight foundation left over from the eight-year war will be completely destroyed. At that time, even if there are unparalleled statesmen, they will be at a loss on the ruins to seek economic construction. Therefore, we have been hesitant day and night, thinking that the current plan for national affairs is better to keep it whole than to break it. We also believe that this kind of realistic problem, all those who are loyal to the country, must have the same heart and the same reason. We are pleased to read the President's New Year's Day address, and we think it is a good opportunity to save the country and survive. Since the consultation on politics, starting like ice and charcoal, and then becoming milk and water, there are many examples recorded in history. Only great benevolence can achieve great courage. This is the capacity of a politician. Using a heart that cannot bear to hurt people to implement a policy that cannot bear to hurt people is a maxim of the sages. We respectfully ask the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to seize the opportunity, turn the tide, and immediately announce a ceasefire in the current location. Each party should send representatives to continue negotiations, uphold the public and loyalty of the national system, and show sincerity to each other. Turn hostility into peace, promote political innovation, and then support industry and commerce, cultivate people's livelihood, and unite the country to bury our heads for ten years and turn misfortune into good fortune. At this moment, we express our dying lament for the industry and commerce, and extend our 400 million hopes for the revival. Shanghai Municipal Industrial Association and Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, together kowtow, Zizhi."

### National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Responds to Peace Call; Advocates Convening National Affairs Conference

The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China telegraphed the government and the Communist Party authorities yesterday, advocating the convening of a National Affairs Conference and calling for comprehensive peace. The original telegram is as follows: "To President Jiang of Nanjing, Vice President Li, the presidents and vice presidents of the Five Yuans, and all members of the Executive Yuan, the members of the Legislative Yuan, the members of the Control Yuan, the heads of various ministries: To the provincial, municipal, and county councils and all groups and chambers of commerce in the country: To Mr. Mao Zedong and Mr. Lin Zuhan in Yan'an, and forwarded to Mr. Zhu De, Mr. Peng Dehuai, Mr. Zhou Enlai, Mr. Dong Biwu, Mr. Ye Jianying, and all members of the Chinese Communist Party: Eight years of war of resistance and three years of internal strife have led to disaster and impoverishment of the country and the people. Looking around the world, all countries are working together to rebuild and construct after the war. At the beginning of our victory, we originally hoped to meet the times, clarify the world, appease the refugees, recuperate, and build the foundation of peaceful unification to create an immortal career in history. However, political consultation failed, and brothers fought, giving foreign countries an excuse, leading to a decline in international status and economic revival, which is difficult to wait for. Opportunities are lost in the blink of an eye, and the whole country mourns. In recent times, fires of war have spread everywhere, and death fills the fields. The foundation of the country is in danger, and the people have no food. Domestic parties are all descendants of Yan and Huang. Warfare is not the original intention. Saving the country and saving the people should be the same. Witnessing the miserable situation of corruption, why not repent and work together to do the aftermath. Reading President's New Year's Day address, with the spirit of great justice and selflessness and the determination to correct chaos, we announce to the world and call for peace. This is the demeanor that a great politician should have. Businessmen across the country have suffered the pain of war and have been exhausted. Listening to this good news, we are extremely moved. Since the war was not caused by one side, reconciliation should be sought through agreement. Our President cares about the people's suffering and advocates peace, and sincerely gains the opportunity. Then, seize the opportunity and convene a National Affairs Conference as soon as possible, use the will of all the people to guide politics to the right track, and the key to success or failure still depends on the mutual sincerity of the two sides. The members of this association especially suggest that the two parties' Standing Committees immediately cease fire on the spot and immediately send representatives to negotiate peace. Putting down the butcher knife is the time. If you still believe in force and ignore feelings, then you are enemies of the people. How can you be forgiven by the people of the country? The boat can carry you or capsize you, which should be done with caution. This association is the general hub of national business groups. I deeply understand the critical situation. At this moment, I am willing to learn the meaning of Fufu's words and use collective action to promote comprehensive peace. Provincial, municipal, and county councils and national vocational groups, loving the country and the nation, have never lagged behind. We urge you to elect the chairman, vice chairman, president, or responsible representative as soon as possible to come to Shanghai together, concentrate the strength of the national people, organize a peace promotion agency, and go to both sides to petition for the people. We hope to turn swords into jade and eliminate hostility into peace. The country's future is fortunate, and the nation's future is fortunate. The President of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, Wang Xiaolai, and all the directors and supervisors together kowtow, Shen Zige."

### Establishing a Strong National Defense New Army; Recruiting Intellectual Youths to Train in Various Places; Shanghai Office Established and Work Begins

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Sun Liren, Commander of the Army Training Command, has been approved to recruit intellectual youths in the Pingjin, Beijing, and Shanghai areas to cultivate outstanding grassroots cadres for the new National Defense Army. It is heard that the recruitment work in Beijing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Jinhua, and other areas has already begun, and the number of applicants in various places is very large. Now, in order to give intellectual youths in Shanghai the opportunity to serve the country, the headquarters has sent special personnel to Shanghai to set up a station to handle recruitment matters. It has found No. 89 Xinmin Road, Baoshan Road, as the office and will start recruitment work soon, setting up stations everywhere to facilitate the process. According to the person in charge, the recruits will be sent to Taiwan in batches for training, with excellent treatment. After the expiration, they will be assigned to serve in the Youth Army. In addition, officers and soldiers of the New First Army and the New Seventh Army stationed in Shanghai who want to report to Taiwan must first go to the office to handle all the procedures.

### If Peace Proves Hopeless - There are Two Paths to Take - Speaker Pan Points Out During Closing Remarks - A Temporary Assembly May Be Convened Again

[Report from Our Newspaper] The closing ceremony of the Eighth General Assembly of the First Session of the Senate began yesterday evening at 8:00 PM. After formal proceedings, Speaker Qing delivered the closing remarks, followed by a speech from Mayor Wu. Senator Ji Hao responded. The closing ceremony concluded with music at approximately 9:00 PM. Speaker Pan stated: "Today is the closing day of the Eighth General Assembly of this session. During this session, we had the opportunity to celebrate the solar New Year, and the fact that this assembly was still able to heatedly discuss various proposals related to this city is truly gratifying. The recent reading of the President's proclamation in the newspapers has given the people great enlightenment, providing new hope for the millions of people in Shanghai. This assembly has already taken the lead in sending a telegram calling for peace, and other senates and people's organizations in various regions have responded one after another. This shows that everyone today is hoping for the arrival of peace, which is 'people sharing the same wish, hearts sharing the same reason'. However, based on my personal observations, I believe that achieving peace is not an easy task. Since the President's proclamation calling for peace was issued, the Communist Party has not responded in any way. We certainly hope that the Communist Party can consider the suffering of the people, abandon the war, and make peace a reality as soon as possible. But what if the Communist Party cannot give up and insists on fighting to the end? I believe that there are only two paths we can take: one is to lay down our arms and wait for the Communist Party to drive straight in and rule the country, and we will become slaves and beasts under their rule. The other is to support the anti-communist government to fight to the end and achieve true peace. Based on the above, it would be ideal to achieve peace at a low cost, but if that doesn't work, we must be prepared to pay the greatest price. We must thoroughly ensure that those with money contribute money and those with strength contribute strength. At that time, this assembly may very likely convene a temporary assembly again to actively discuss and make decisions. I hope that at that time, everyone will not argue about who contributes more or less."

The Decrease in Proposals is a Sign of Progress

"Furthermore, this assembly session was brief, but important proposals were carefully reviewed by the review committee, and all cases were processed sequentially by the assembly, which is very gratifying. Some people have recently argued that the number of proposals during the Senate's meetings is decreasing and that many senators are no longer interested in the proposals. However, I do not think that is the case; on the contrary, I believe that it is a sign of progress. The reason I think it is a sign of progress is that, with regard to the proposals of this assembly, if a proposal is not made, it will be considered unimportant. If it is made, it must be important and we should strive to implement it. Also, I have some reservations about the regulation that more than half of the members must be present for a meeting to be held. This regulation is unique to China. Fortunately, the central government has now realized this, so when the Legislative Yuan holds meetings, it considers it legal if one-fifth of the members are present. I firmly believe that this point will be revised and improved in the future, because democratic politics are experienced from actual experience. China is currently still in its infancy, but it will gradually grow, and we can be absolutely optimistic."

The Mayor Hopes the People Will Have the Greatest Confidence

Mayor Wu's speech briefly stated: "The Speaker just discussed the progress of the Senate and the prospects for peace, and I agree very much. I also believe that if peace is hopeless, the Senate has the possibility of convening a temporary meeting. During this turbulent situation, it is most difficult for those in charge of central or local administrative agencies. Many things cannot be handled, such as rent issues, public utility price issues, tuition issues, etc., which cannot be resolved. Therefore, I have a feeling that perhaps I committed some transgression in a previous life, and I am being punished in this life to serve as a local administrative official. In today's situation, I only hope that the people can understand the government's difficulties and have the greatest confidence. I also hope that the senators will constantly provide guidance to the municipal government."

Senator Ji's Response Emphasizes the Importance of Three Proposals

Ji Hao stated in his response: "I personally believe that among the various proposals passed by this assembly, there are three basic and important ones: (1) The universal education proposal. The government should do its best to promote its completion, because education is the foundation of national construction. (2) The organization of military-civilian cooperation stations is very important in today's war-torn situation and is of great importance to the public security of the suburbs and the city. I hope that the government will handle it quickly. (3) Adjust the district and protection organizations and improve self-defense capabilities. People are born into the world, survival comes first, and life comes second. As long as we give full play to our own strength, all problems can be solved. Also, the solar New Year has brought us news of peace, but whether it can be realized depends on the sincerity of the Communist Party. Now everyone is looking forward to the Communist Party's awakening so that peace can come. But we also hope that since the government has opened the door to peace, it must have a large capacity and be based on the will and strength of the people. Only in this way can we achieve true peace."

### Salt Merchant Staying at Friend's Home - Gold Jewelry Stolen

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yang Longyu, a 49-year-old salt merchant from Changsha, resides at No. 63 Fanhuangdu Road, Shanghai West, and his family is well-off. Yang has a colleague and friend named Shen Song, 57 years old. Recently, because he has a trip to Taiwan, he temporarily brought his wife to Yang's residence to wait for the flight. Last New Year's Eve, Shen's wife took out her gold jewelry and other items stored in the bank, including a large gold bar (weighing five taels), two small gold bars, three taels of gold ingots, a gold lock pendant with a chain weighing three taels, a gold coin (weighing one tael), two gold watch bands, a jade ring, and two British gold pounds with inlaid edges. She packed them into a package, put them in a black briefcase, and at the same time, she also put 6,000 gold yuan (in four bundles) in the leather bag. Below the gold jewelry were 15 US dollars, clipped between two 500 yuan Guan Jin notes, also placed in the bag. The briefcase was placed in the five-drawer chest in the room and was not locked. When Shen Song returned from outside at dusk on the third day, he noticed that Yang had a friend dancing downstairs, and his wife also participated. Not long after, he went upstairs and realized that something was wrong with the leather bag in the five-drawer chest. He checked it and found that the four bundles of gold yuan were still there, but the package of gold jewelry on the lower level was missing. He initially thought it was hidden by his wife. However, when his wife returned to the room after dancing and he asked her, he realized that it had been stolen. He immediately reported the situation to the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-bureau. After Chief Yu ordered patrolman Meng Ruisheng to lead the police to investigate, he also summoned male and female servants to the bureau for interrogation, but there are still no clues.

### Prices Generally Rise by 30% to 50% - The Surge in Cotton Cloth is Especially Fierce - Credit Tightens, Interest Rates Rise in the Dark, People Still See Good Prospects

[Report from Our Newspaper] The intensity of the price increase in the red market this year has exceeded general expectations. The prices of major daily necessities this morning increased by 30% to 50% compared to the closing of the market last year. The market began to decline in the afternoon. The buying price for foreign exchange transfer certificates was 134 yuan this morning, and the selling price was 135 yuan (New Year's Eve was 120 yuan). High-grade white japonica rice was 810 yuan per dan in the northern market yesterday and 780 yuan in the southern market (New Year's Eve was 670 yuan). The market price of 120-count raw silk was 53,000 yuan this morning, once reaching 56,000 yuan at the highest point, and closed at 47,000 yuan in the evening (New Year's Eve was 41,500 yuan). The highest market price for 20-count Bianma brand cotton yarn yesterday was 37,500 yuan, and it fell back to 35,000 yuan at noon (New Year's Eve was around 31,000 yuan). The price of 42-count Blue Phoenix was 50,500 yuan this morning, and it fell to 49,000 yuan in the afternoon (New Year's Eve was 47,500 yuan). The price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth rose surprisingly, reaching a high of 1,510 yuan this morning, with an average of 1,410 yuan. By the closing of the market in the evening, off-market transactions were selling at 1,350 yuan (New Year's Eve was 960 yuan).

During this red market price surge, the price of cotton cloth rose the most fiercely. According to industry insiders, the price of cotton cloth is closely related to overseas remittances. Therefore, the Central Bank's increase in the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates greatly stimulated the price of cotton cloth. It is also heard that the Central Bank will continue to increase the market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates. Therefore, although credit has tightened, people still see good prospects. In addition, the high balancing fee of 4,500 yuan for exchanging gold directly stimulated the rise in gold prices. Those who applied to the Shenzhu for exchange yesterday were required to pay on the same day, but could not pick up the goods until a week later. The price of 50 US dollars in overseas remittances was 6,500 yuan. Adding the interest on the discount, it exceeded 8,000 yuan. Therefore, it is natural that the dark market price of gold fees was as high as over 8,000 yuan. Also, credit tightened in the afternoon yesterday, and the hidden interest rate has increased to 50 yuan per day. If relevant authorities can sell a large amount of goods, then credit will continue to tighten and the price trend may temporarily stabilize.

### Yesterday's Opening of the Red Board: Cotton Yarn Reaches Record High Prices; 42-Count Blue Phoenix Soars to $54,000

Cotton yarn saw a unanimous rise on the opening of the red board, with strong demand from all sides, boosting morale. The trading floor saw heavy buying, and holders were reluctant to sell.

42-count Blue Phoenix opened at $51,000, briefly reaching a high of $54,000. Towards the close, due to government selling, sentiment softened, and the afternoon session closed back down to $50,000. This was still an increase of around $11,000 compared to before the holiday. 40-count Blue Phoenix was bid up to $49,000, and 32-count Silver Moon initially opened at $40,000. Although it briefly climbed to $43,000, it retreated near the opening price at closing, settling at $40,500, a jump of $9,000.

21-count Double Horse spot goods initially opened at $36,500, reaching close to the $40,000 mark. The afternoon session was $1,000 lower than the opening price, at $35,500, ultimately rising $9,500. Warehouse receipts closed at $33,000, with one-day arbitrage at $1,500. 20-count Double Horse slipped from $34,000 to close at $32,000. Remaining yarns saw increases of over 20%, all reaching unprecedented new peaks.

### Cotton Cloth Soars

Although the market was closed during the holiday, transactions occurred outside the market, with prices gradually rising. Yesterday, the opening price for the red board was $1,480 for first-grade fine cloth, and $1,440 for Four Gentlemen Yuan Bi. During the session, both domestic and foreign buyers showed strong demand, further pushing prices upward. Towards the close, news spread that the national bank was selling large quantities of yarn and cloth to absorb idle funds, causing nervousness. Ultimately, resistance was futile, and the former retreated to $1,410, still a substantial increase of $450 compared to before the holiday. The latter closed at $1,300, a rise of $400. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong fell from $1,460 to close at $1,370, ultimately up $460. High-end 190 Shilin Factory boards were at $3,000, printed twill at $1,450, and other cloths were up about 30% compared to before the holiday. However, the foundation is still weak, and a decline is possible today.

### Banks Pay Reserve Requirements; Government Bonds and Treasury Bills Still Acceptable as Collateral

But Not to Exceed Fifty Percent

[Our Report] Regarding the reserve requirements for banks, the Ministry of Finance, based on the provisions of the Banking Law and considering the circumstances at the time, previously stipulated six implementation measures. Items 2, 3, and 4 specified the ratios for various banks to pay, and item 5 stipulated that government bonds and treasury bills could be used to offset up to 30% of the required deposit amount, as well as the valuation standards for bonds. Later, to strengthen credit contraction, the implementation of item 5, which allowed government bonds and treasury bills to offset up to 51%, was temporarily suspended. It is now understood that the Ministry of Finance, in order to encourage banks to attract deposits, will continue to implement the original regulations for the deposit rates of guarantee reserves for various banks. Furthermore, item 5, which was previously suspended, will be reinstated, allowing various banks in different regions to use government bonds to offset the deposited amount as appropriate, without restrictions. However, the valuation standards for bonds will still be handled according to the original item 5.

### Government Sells Cotton Yarn

Yesterday, the money supply was not tight, but the high exchange balancing fee caused prices to skyrocket. To curb the price surge, the Central Bank began selling large quantities of cotton yarn yesterday, and the Sino-American Joint Cotton Yarn and Cloth Administration also participated in the sales. The China Textile Corporation (CTC) sold 184 bales of yarn, withdrawing a total of 11,116,000 yuan from circulation.

### Decision on How Financial Firms Can Increase Capital

Regarding the matter of financial firms depositing cash from increased capital into the Central Bank, it was handled properly on December 31st of last year. According to responsible persons from the Banking Association, regarding the methods for using these deposited funds, in addition to the Ministry-stipulated methods for using deposited capital and the supplement authorizing the Central Bank to approve the use of funds for mortgage loans with a term of one month or more, the association has discussed and decided on the following detailed rules with the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau:

(1) If each bank needs to use these funds, it can fill out a form and send it to the association for verification, which will then be forwarded to the Financial Management Bureau. The funds can be used after joint approval by the Bureau and the Central Bank.

(2) This flexible method of using funds is being handled by the association on behalf of each bank. Therefore, the application must be verifiable and attributable, focusing on being realistic. This is to avoid difficulties when the association's representatives attend consultations at the Financial Management Bureau.

(3) The association has invited Mr. Xu Xie Kang from Shanghai Bank and Mr. Cai Songfu from Dunxu Bank to come to the association every day to review the applications from each bank, and will also send personnel to each bank to verify the accounts to ensure accuracy.

(4) When each bank sends its first application to the association, it should attach a copy of its year-end balance sheet for review.

(5) If applying to make credit loans, the amount should follow the bank's regulations and must not exceed 25% of its total deposits.

(6) For funds that have been approved for use for the first time, if a bank needs to continue the application upon expiration, it should make arrangements in advance, and it is best if the amount is equal to ensure continuity.

(7) The application for using these funds is negotiated under the principle of not violating the Ministry-stipulated methods for using deposited capital, adopting a cyclical application method, lasting for three months. Therefore, the interval between each application and the amount of each application should be divided into several periods by each bank, and the amounts should be evenly distributed to facilitate review.

### Rising Prices at Origin; Rice Prices Rise Across the Board; White Rice in North City Breaks $800 Mark

The rice market is rising sharply due to rising prices at the origin, which are higher than the declared prices. Furthermore, the prices of miscellaneous grains and edible oils rose the previous day, leading to exceptionally strong sentiment. The market opened with a surge, and white rice in the North City market has broken the $800 mark, reaching $810. Bo Dao Yangxian is also approaching the $800 mark, with each rising by a substantial $180, an increase of 30%. White Yuan is as high as $850.

The rise has not stopped, and sentiment remains bullish. Retail demand is quite strong. With rice prices rising, sellers are raising prices. The Central Market is the most popular. Although prices slightly retreated at closing, the overall increase was still substantial. Old Car Flour opened at $380, reaching $390 at one point, and closed at $385, up $48. Bingchuan Flour closed at $381, up $46. Red Bee closed at $363, and Jiancheng closed at $350, each up more than $40. Large bags of wheat bran rose sharply by more than $30.

Soybeans initially rose by $50, but then demand weakened, retreating by $20, ultimately rising by $30 and $40. Corn opened steady, and closed down by $10 and $20. Red Sorghum rose slightly by $10, but there were no buyers at closing. Yuan Wheat was steady. Sesame was rarely offered, rising by $100. Guan Dian White Sesame was at $1,200. Raw Peanuts rose again. Yangzhou Tizhuang Raw Peanuts were at $1,900, a sharp increase of $150.

Edible Oil

Prices initially rose and then fell, ultimately closing higher, but the market sentiment at closing was very weak. The market opened with bullish sentiment due to rising rice prices. Soybean oil opened outside of $3,000, reaching as high as $3,200. Later, due to excessively high prices, demand was sluggish, and sellers sold at the high. Soybean oil closed back down to $3,000, at $2,950, up $150. Rapeseed oil closed at $2,800, up $200. Raw oil was at $3,000. Small Car Sesame Oil closed at $2,520.

Jianghai Customs announces: The minimum value threshold for consularly-visaed imported goods will be raised to $4,000, effective immediately. The consular visa fee for shipping documents will be raised to $200 per set.

### Tea Market Shows Potential for Profit

The tea market opened this morning, continuing the momentum from before the holiday. With other goods in the market showing prosperity, sellers showed a profitable posture and raised prices. The red board price went straight up. Despite other goods falling back slightly, tea prices were not affected, showing signs of being easy to rise but hard to fall. Transactions were few due to difficult negotiations between buyers and sellers.

### Tung Oil Rises

Tung oil prices rose steadily yesterday, with the red board opening with a strong showing. Later, negative news emerged, and reports of falling prices for other goods caused sentiment to weaken slightly. However, compared to last year, the overall increase was still substantial.

### Business Briefs

The timber tea party started on the 2nd. Opening prices were higher than last year, and the market became firmer on the 3rd and 4th. The rise was particularly large for fir strips. Large and small strips opened at $4.45, and Wu Fen Song and Tang Hu boards also generally rose by about 20%. Western pine plywood also followed suit, rising by several yuan. Hang timber saw few transactions.

Rubber opened on the red board with general increases of around 30%. Prices rose again yesterday amid rising prices for other goods, reaching unprecedented peaks.

Cement factory prices have not yet been determined, but bids at the tea party were at $180 to $200. Roofing asphalt was also popular, selling for $13 per pound.

### Intestine Export Suddenly Improves, Could Recover to Pre-War Levels

According to sources in the sausage casing export industry: Shanghai sausage casing exports reached over 300 barrels in December of last year, breaking the record since the victory. The reason is that since the implementation of the foreign exchange transfer certificate, its selling price has been rising daily. At this time, domestic prices are relatively stable, which is stimulating exports.

Another reason is that in December of last year, the main sources of small intestine supply, the areas around Bengbu and Hefei, were relatively peaceful, and transportation between Wuhu and Shanghai was also relatively smooth, allowing the production areas to continue to supply goods.

According to industry insiders, before the war, the national average monthly export of sausage casings was about 1,000 barrels, with Shanghai accounting for 600 barrels. Currently, the domestic cost of sausage casing is about 18 yuan per set, and the foreign FOB price is US$0.18 per set. Based on the market price of the foreign exchange transfer certificate (about 24 gold yuan), if the foreign exchange transfer certificate continues to improve, general exporters will rush to purchase, and sausage casing factories that have been closed for a long time will resume operations one after another. If the current situation remains unchanged, sausage casing exports in January of this year could reach 500 barrels, and it will not be difficult to restore to pre-war levels in the near future.

### New Year in Nantong; New Personnel, New Policies

— Our Reporter Ye Yongshu

[Our Report, Nantong, 2nd] On New Year's Eve in Nantong, it was drizzling, not too heavy, not too light. Everyone thought that the next day would definitely be rainy. However, the New Year's Day of the thirty-eighth year was unexpectedly different: the rain stopped, the clouds dispersed, and the sun began to peek at the earth from the seams of the clouds. The mood of the people of Nantong for the New Year was like the weather: sunlight was peeking onto the sensitive hearts of the people.

At the beginning of this Gregorian New Year, and as the lunar calendar entered December, those who followed the new calendar have already reviewed the past and planned for the future. Those who followed the old calendar were also preparing for a summary at this time.

During this time of "getting rid of the old and bringing in the new," a new lineup has been arranged in the Nantong officialdom. County Magistrate Chen Gengyao has been in office for almost a year, which is considered the longest tenure among the county magistrates of Nantong since the restoration. He claims to be physically weak and often ill. In reality, it is because the county's finances are tight and he is unable to turn the situation around, so he has repeatedly telegraphed his resignation. The provincial government approved his resignation at the last meeting of the thirty-seventh year and reassigned him, replacing him with Huang Xiangchen, the county magistrate of Jiangning County. Coincidentally, the chief of the county police bureau, the director of the tax collection office, and the president of the local court have also been replaced with new personnel. The New Year, with new personnel and new policies, should be a refreshing change.

December Yellow Soil Worth More Than Silver

"December yellow soil is worth more than silver." This year is no exception. In the second half of December, the magnitude of price fluctuations broke the price increase record since the currency system reform and the lifting of price controls. Especially on the 27th and 28th, there were multiple price changes in one day, and the people were panicked and almost unable to live their days. Among them, rice was the most affected. Compared to the rice prices in Wuxi and Shanghai, it was two to two and a half times more expensive. Hai'an to the north and Haimen to the east are much lower. This is an abnormal phenomenon.

Organizing a Merchant Fleet to Transport Rice

The Nantong Command's Economic Office paid close attention to this matter and convened relevant agencies and grain merchants on the afternoon of New Year's Eve to discuss the two issues of unblocking the source of grain and approving grain prices. Although Nantong is a city close to the rice-producing area of Lixiahe, it is affected by poor transportation and social unrest, and cannot purchase locally. Instead, it has to purchase from the Jiangnan Wuxi area. Recently, some ports in the Jiangyin area have been blockaded, and the 8,000 piculs of rice that had already been purchased cannot be transported. At the symposium, it was decided that the Grain Industry Association would be responsible for organizing a merchant fleet, reporting to the Jiangyin Fortress Command and the Nantong Command for record-keeping, to transport the purchased grain. At the meeting, rice prices were rigidly regulated. From New Year's Day onwards, white glutinous rice was set at 1,000 yuan per picul, second-grade glutinous rice at 950 yuan, indica rice at 870 yuan, and second-grade indica rice at 810 yuan. Subsequently, the flour mills will use the false Wuxi standard, plus half a sheng of ascending power, half a sheng of descending power — seven he of descending Douli, seven sheng of freight, and the remittance water for remittances to Wuxi, and the legal profit of three sheng, totaling less than two dou, that is, the Nantong rice price should not exceed 20% of the Wuxi rice price.

Three Reasons for the Coolness of Cotton Collection

Cotton is the source of wealth for Nantong. After autumn, the entire Nantong market directly and indirectly relies on the money earned by farmers selling cotton to activate it. However, the cotton market last year was unusually deserted. There were as many as 10 to 20 Jiangnan manufacturers coming to Nantong to collect cotton at the end of the year before last, but last year they "hesitated to move forward." The year before last, the China Textile Corporation (CTC) collected more than 100,000 dan of cotton here, but last year the State Cotton Nantong Joint Purchasing Office did not even collect 30,000 dan. The difference is huge. According to analysis, there are three main reasons for this: During the price control period, because the price was too low, cotton farmers were unwilling to sell, so there were almost no transactions. Later, after the price controls were lifted, cotton merchants were unwilling to buy in due to social unrest and uncertainty. Recently, it could be done, but the weather was not cooperating, with continuous rain and inconvenient transportation, so there were not many transactions either. In addition to the Joint Purchasing Office, Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory is also collecting cotton, but it is using the method of exchanging yarn for cotton. Currently, it is stipulated that 830 catties of lint can be exchanged for one bale of 20-count Red Kui yarn.

Three Examples of "Colluding to Oppress the People"

On December 26, the Kuomintang Daily published an "Alternate Theory" entitled "To Win Back the Hearts of the People, Root Out Corruption and Malpractice," listing examples of "colluding to oppress the people": "(1) A grain industry person in the ninth district without any learning (chairman of the grain association), actually took the opportunity to forcibly collect more than one-tenth of the in-kind grain from passing grain boats. (2) A non-drafted young man in the fourth district was actually sent to the yamen in a daze, and spent a certain amount of cotton yarn as the price to get off the 'Looking Home Terrace.' (3) Also: It is rumored that there is a tax ticket fraud case, with many accomplices, colluding to form a gang, what else is there to say." These are just three examples. All these opinions and public opinion agencies have been notified, but the listeners still ignore them. It is hoped that these blemishes of Nantong will disappear with the old year, and that a new face will come with the New Year.

The Newspaper Industry Is Struggling

Let's talk about the newspaper industry in Nantong. Under the successive blows of "price controls," "opening," and "price increases," the newspaper industry in Nantong has reached its most difficult stage. This New Year's Day, apart from using red ink, changing New Year's advertisements, and the usual few celebratory articles, there was nothing unusual. If we had to find something special, the change in the layout of the Tongbao this year would be considered a major event in the news industry. Under the threat of price increases, a four-page newspaper has been in arrears with wages for three months, and it is impossible to pay even a small amount of money for the New Year. Although the economic conditions of the newspaper are the same, the journalists here do not complain, and mostly use their limited free time to take on other odd jobs to maintain their personal livelihoods. As for the newspaper, they are always struggling to support it.

### Neglectful Guarding: Five Important Criminals in Suzhou Escape from Prison

[Our Report, Suzhou, 4th] The county's local court detention center, due to the negligence of the guards on the night of December 31st of last year, had five important incarcerated criminals escape from prison. One was Zhou Jigen, who had already been sentenced to death for murder for money, and the other four were sentenced to more than 10 years of imprisonment. The escape of the five criminals was discovered on New Year's Day, and searches were carried out everywhere. However, the escaped criminals had already fled far away and have not yet been captured.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders All Counties and Cities to Quickly Form Enlistment Teams

[Our Report, Zhenjiang, 4th] In order to lay the foundation for conscription in all counties and cities in Jiangsu Province and to ensure that civilian self-defense training is coordinated with military service, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has telegraphed all county and city governments, starting in January, to organize young people aged 20 to 25 and those of military age in the county into "enlistment teams" in order to facilitate conscription this year. As soon as the quota is announced, they will quickly carry out conscription.

### Pocket News

Zhenhai

Pinghu

[Our Report] Ma Xujin, the administrator of the former Xintai Office of the Field Grain Office, embezzled more than 1,700 piculs of rice and could not make up for it. Although former County Magistrate Fan and former Field Grain Office Zheng Dingfang came to the county to mediate, the newspapers believed that the case was serious and that, in addition to compensating for the embezzled rice, he should be severely punished. The case was concluded on the 31st by Judge Liu of the local court, who sentenced him to life imprisonment.

Wuxing

[Our Report] The county's price review committee was reorganized, and the county government hired Ling Yi'an as the chairman, and Chen Heting, Yuan Youren, Ke Shi, Lu Yu, Yang Qiyan, and Qian Jingru as members.

[Our Report] The case of the collection of field tax in early rice in the county, due to the fact that most of the agricultural income is grain, and the provincial government ordered the flexible conversion to 30,000 shi of gold yuan, has aroused suspicion among people from all walks of life that the collectors are committing fraud. They have requested that the names of the income households, acreage, and location of the villages be publicly announced to dispel public doubts. It is now understood that the field tax collection offices in the five early rice districts of Chengdong, Qihuang, Fengqiao, Wangdian, and Buyun have submitted the converted accounts to the County Field Grain Office, and the County Office has transferred the accounts to the County Council for review at the next county government review meeting.
