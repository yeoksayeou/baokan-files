### Communist Forces Inspect US Ambassador's Residence, US State Department Orders Protest

[US Information Service, Washington, 25th] Chinese Communist soldiers invaded Ambassador Stuart's bedroom in Nanjing this morning and inspected other bedrooms. They did not take anything with them when they left.

A State Department spokesman said that the U.S. government had instructed the U.S. military attaché in Nanjing to "lodge a strong protest with the Chinese Communist military authorities."

The soldiers roamed around the bedroom, inspecting objects, and said that the equipment in the room would eventually belong to the people because it should belong to the people.

### President Chiang to Issue Important Statement in the Coming Days to Clarify the Situation

[Our Report] According to authoritative sources, as the situation has developed to this point, the true colors of the Communists have gradually been revealed. Although the Communist radio station in Peiping has been broadcasting widely in recent days, attempting to deceive people with leniency, their blatant disregard for public law, shelling of British warships, and sending troops armed with guns into Ambassador Stuart's bedroom in the U.S. Embassy in Nanjing, coercing the U.S. Ambassador not to leave the embassy compound, show that they are willingly controlled by the Soviet Union and reject the evil intentions of Britain and the United States. The freedom of the people is even more impossible to guarantee. For this reason, news came from Guangzhou yesterday that President Chiang will issue an important document in the coming days to clarify the situation.

[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 26th] According to the Overseas Chinese Evening News, President Chiang has arrived in Xiamen.

### Xinjiang Mints Silver Dollars, Reforms the Currency System on May 1st, Issues Silver Dollar Notes Redeemable at Full Value

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 26th] The Xinjiang Province has been approved by the central government to implement currency reform starting on May 1st. All old provincial currency will be recalled completely within three months from May 1st, and silver dollar notes will be issued with full backing and unlimited redemption in order to completely stabilize the currency value. A mint has now been officially established and is mass-producing silver coins. The salaries of all provincial and county-level government employees and the accounting system throughout Xinjiang will henceforth be denominated in silver coins, and various payment standards have been set. The salaries of senior and junior officials range from a minimum of nine yuan to a maximum of eighteen yuan. Henceforth, all central government grant standards will not apply to Xinjiang Province.

He said: If the situation in the Far East continues to deteriorate, then "the American people on the Pacific coast can be sure that the Third World War will begin because the Communist Party controls the Pacific." "A new military and economic threat has risen in the Pacific region, far more powerful than the Japanese threat that we fought to eradicate."

Chennault said: "All of China's tragedy was caused by our own mistakes." He said that the current situation in China is not completely hopeless.

### Deng Wenyi Receives Reporters; Reviews the Battle Situation on the Yangtze River; The National Army Will Resolutely Resist at the Final Defense Line

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Deng Wenyi, Director of the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, reviewed the battle situation on the Yangtze River at a reception for reporters held at the Cultural and Educational Association yesterday. Mr. Deng's analysis points:

(1) The Communist bandits' general attack to cross the river failed - The Communist bandits have consistently lacked sincerity in the peace talks. Mao Zedong stated on January 14th that he had definitively pointed out that the Communist army would fight to the end and attempted to "resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly annihilate the National Army" to achieve its conspiracy to completely sell out China. Since March, it has thoroughly mobilized the manpower and material resources in its bandit areas in Northeast China, North China, East China, and Central China, concentrating two-thirds of its military strength to prepare to cross the river. On the 20th of this month, the peace talks broke down. On the 21st, Mao Zedong ordered a general attack, hoping to launch a sudden attack on Nanjing, crossing the river in two places: between Anqing and Wuhu in central Anhui, and between Jiangyin and Zhenjiang in northern Jiangsu, to surround and annihilate the main force of our Yangtze River defense, and to carry out its conspiracy of attacking Nanjing to isolate Wuhan and liquidate Shanghai, and then advancing rapidly into South China. The National Army had already seen through its conspiracy, avoided a decisive battle on the Yangtze River, and carried out a planned strategic retreat, causing its general attack to fail. Although the bandit army is gradually crossing the Yangtze River, it has not hit the main force of the National Army, which proves that the Communist army's strategy of crossing the river has not been successful.

(2) The National Army's strategic retreat was successful - In order to break the bandit's strategy of encirclement and annihilation, and to implement a long-term and sustained war of attrition, the National Army implemented a strategic retreat in the middle section of the Yangtze River, from Jiangyin to Anqing. In the past week, the defending army on the river has safely retreated to the designated defense line. Except for some losses to a small number of defending troops west of Wuhu and on the opposite bank of Jiangyin, and the bridgehead of Pukou, and the defection of several battalions belonging to the Jiangyin Fortress Command, which were newly formed defense units, the main force of the National Army, about ten armies, totaling more than 200,000 men, has retreated to the new defense line to continue fighting. Because the strength of the National Army continues to exist, a long-term war of attrition has begun. In the future, except for necessary strategic strongholds in the Southwest, Northwest, and Southeast, which must continue to be defended, the gains and losses of one city or one place will not affect the overall war situation. Today's situation is better than the situation during the retreat from Nanjing in the early days of the War of Resistance.

(3) The defense of Shanghai is solid and can be defended - The Communist bandits are conspiring to take Shanghai without a fight because of its abundant resources, and then liquidate it. Therefore, the number of troops they have used around Shanghai so far is very small. The strength of the National Army in Shanghai is very strong. The National Army in the middle section of the Yangtze River has recently sent a large number of reinforcements to Shanghai. All units are strong, well-trained, and are well-coordinated between ground, sea, and air forces, so the Communist army will not invade Shanghai, otherwise they will be given a fierce and heavy blow. Thanks to the people's money and efforts, support, and comfort, the lives of officers and soldiers are improving day by day, and their morale is high, which is a guarantee of victory. As long as the military and civilians are united, concentrate their efforts, and work to defend greater Shanghai, they will be able to break the Communist bandits' conspiracy by steadfastly defending Shanghai.

(4) The Communist bandits will face more difficulties after crossing the river - The Communist bandits easily crossed the Yangtze River and, after Shenyang and Tianjin, occupied some more cities. Their deception and oppression of the people in North China and their hypocritical urban policies and land reform policies will soon begin to be tested in Jiangnan. The people's support and opposition will inevitably increase their resentment towards the Communist bandits since the people of Jiangnan are accustomed to a free life. The Communist bandits' forces are dispersed, and the degree of difficulty in trying to implement military control and military communism everywhere will be greater than in North China and Northeast China. The National Army will resolutely resist when it retreats to the final defense line, and coupled with the resistance of the people's self-defense forces, it will inevitably make the Communist Party and the Communist army feel thorny everywhere. It is impossible for the Communist bandits to dream of ending the war this year. As the war drags on, the weaknesses of the Communist bandits will be further exposed, and the awakening, unity, progress, and anti-communist and national salvation movement of the Kuomintang, the National Army, and the people of the whole country will surely rise with the international anti-communist trend.

Editorial

### Stabilizing People's Livelihood Comes First!

The peace talks unfortunately broke down, and the Chinese Communists ordered a general offensive. The war has shifted from the north bank of the Yangtze River to the south of the Yangtze River. In less than a few days, the National Army, for strategic reasons, successively abandoned cities such as Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, and Wuxi. The flames of war are gradually moving east, making the citizens of Shanghai feel more and more heavy-hearted, and everyone feels a sense of urgency. Residents of the suburbs, supporting the old and carrying the young, have moved into the urban area, presenting a wartime scene on the streets. No matter how clear the reason is, no matter how strong the will is, it seems that some panic is unavoidable in the face of the current turmoil, and it is impossible to remain calm even if one wants to.

However, this is not the first time that the citizens of Shanghai have suffered from war and danger. In the past ten years or so, wars have been frequent and they have endured many hardships. The Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army reached Shanghai in 1925, the "January 28th" Shanghai Incident in 1932, the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle broke out again in 1937, and the outbreak of the "December 8th" Pacific War in 1941. Each time an incident suddenly occurred, Shanghai was placed in the midst of a stormy sea. Fortunately, the citizens of Shanghai have the spirit of "sharing weal and woe," which ultimately enabled Shanghai to overcome difficulties, preserve the vitality of this industrial and commercial city, and avoid any major losses. Today, we are facing this unprecedentedly serious difficulty again. Whether Shanghai can be spared from the catastrophe of war is a major test for the people of Shanghai.

Shanghai is a city with five million citizens. How to maintain public order when the flames of war are approaching is indeed a serious and important issue. However, we believe that the way to maintain public order is to first stabilize people's livelihood. Although Shanghai is the economic center of the country and the richest area in Jiangnan, in recent years, due to the deterioration of the economic situation, the lives of ordinary people are far from what they used to be, and almost everyone is threatened by high prices. Instability of life is what everyone feels painful. But today, the flames of war will spread to Shanghai, and the suburbs are about to become battlefields. Not only will the sources of food, vegetables, firewood, etc., which are needed daily by the citizens, be cut off, but also the people in the suburbs will concentrate in the urban area, and consumption will increase greatly. In the situation where supply cannot meet demand, price increases are inevitable. Under the premise that the government is determined to fight and the people support anti-communism, if the responsible authorities do not find ways to help the refugees and suppress prices, those civilians who have no means of living may be forced to take risks, causing social unrest and deepening the crisis in Shanghai. Therefore, we believe that to maintain public order, it is necessary to stabilize people's livelihood; to win victory, it is even more necessary to stabilize people's livelihood. The responsible authorities must pay more attention to the livelihood of the civilians. In addition to storing grain and coal and implementing rationed food, they must also actively evacuate the population, organize the sale of cheap grain, and reduce the difficulty for the civilians to obtain living materials. This is the fundamental plan to maintain order and stabilize people's hearts.

However, the soaring prices in the war zone are inevitable economic phenomena. Relying solely on the local military and political authorities to try to suppress them with artificial forces is still not a fundamental solution. The most important thing is to rely on the wealthy in society to generously donate and fully exert the spirit of "sharing weal and woe" so that all five million citizens of Shanghai can have food to eat, people's hearts can be stabilized, there will be no problem with public order, and victory can be truly hoped for. At present, some wealthy merchants and magnates, seeing that disaster is imminent, have fled one after another, but only a few people know to escape for their lives without caring about their careers. Most people, for the sake of their careers and the future of their hometown, do not care about leaving Shanghai. Since they stay in Shanghai, they must do their best to assist the local authorities in maintaining order. On the negative side, they must no longer stir up trouble in the market, raising prices and making it impossible for civilians to live. On the positive side, they should donate to the local authorities based on the spirit of sharing weal and woe to help the refugees who have moved from the suburbs to the urban area and the civilians who have no means of living, and must achieve the goal that everyone has food to eat. In this way, people's livelihood will be stable, and there will be no problem with public order.

There is a popular saying in Shanghai society, which is "the poor rely on the rich, and the rich rely on the poor." In ordinary times, it may not be obvious, but in times of great difficulty, this saying contains infinite truth. In fact, what we often say, "those who have money contribute money, and those who have strength contribute strength," and "sharing weal and woe" have the same meaning. However, in terms of stabilizing people's livelihood, we ultimately hope that those who have money will contribute more! Shanghai has so much manpower and material resources and must accomplish the task of defending Shanghai so that it will not suffer the catastrophe of war. But this time is a major test of whether the five million citizens of Shanghai can "share weal and woe!"

### The Soviet Union Suggests Convening a Meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers to Discuss the Entire German Issue; The Berlin Blockade Will Be Lifted as Soon as the Date is Set

[United Press, London, 26th] The Soviet Union reduced the price of lifting the Berlin blockade on the 26th and opened the door for the East and West to renegotiate many outstanding difficult issues. Moscow Radio broadcast a statement from senior Soviet officials stating that the East-West blockade of Berlin could be lifted if the four powers first agreed to convene a meeting of foreign ministers at a fixed date to discuss the entire German issue. The broadcast said that Soviet representative to the United Nations Malik had forwarded this proposal to U.S. representative Jessup. The Soviet statement specifically mentioned today that the Berlin currency issue should be resolved by the foreign ministers' meeting, which was the excuse for the Soviet blockade of Berlin. Moscow also said that the Soviet Union only opposed the establishment of a West German government, and the decision on this matter should be discussed at the foreign ministers' meeting. Previously, the Soviet Union insisted that the plans for the two German governments must be stopped before the blockade was lifted.

[Associated Press, London, 26th] TASS announced today that Soviet representative to the United Nations Malik has proposed to U.S. representative Jessup that if the Western countries can set a date acceptable to the Soviet Union to hold a meeting of the four foreign ministers to discuss the entire German issue, the Soviet Union is willing to lift the Berlin blockade before the meeting. The Western countries have not expressed any opinion on this. If this proposal is as reported by TASS, it will be a major concession by the Soviet Union. The breakdown of the negotiations between the two sides in the past was due to the timing issue. The Western countries insisted that the blockade must be lifted first, and then the four-power meeting should be held. Now the Soviet Union has proposed lifting the blockade and the Western countries' counter-blockade, and then the four foreign ministers will meet to discuss various unresolved German issues. The Soviet Union has strongly opposed this order of priority in past negotiations. The Western countries and West German leaders have established a historic agreement on the 25th night, completely bypassing the Soviet occupation zone to establish a West German government with its own constitution. The Soviet Union opposes this plan and will raise it at the foreign ministers' meeting. According to TASS, the Soviet Union has specifically suggested that the issue of restoring a unified currency in Berlin should be left to the four foreign ministers' meeting to resolve.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] TASS confirmed that Soviet representative Malik had proposed to U.S. representative Jessup to lift the Berlin blockade. Diplomatic circles here believe that this is an important political action. The fact that this issue was discussed by representatives of the United States and the Soviet Union in the United Nations lounge has long been known to diplomatic circles, but it has not been confirmed by authoritative sources. International observers believe that the publication of this news by the Soviet official news agency is related to the final development of the West German constitution.

### Allied Powers and German Leaders Eliminate Differences; West German Constitution Draft Completed; German Federal Republic Established in Mid-July

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] The three occupying powers, Britain, the United States, and France, and seventeen leaders of West German political parties reached an agreement today on the West German constitution, bringing to an end the work of German political leaders who have been searching for eight months for a draft constitution acceptable to the three powers. Today, the three powers' governors held talks with German leaders for six hours. Governor Robertson of Britain said afterwards that this full and final agreement is a historic stage in the relationship between the occupying powers and the German people.

Governor Clay of the United States predicted that with the completion of the constitution, the German Republic is expected to be established in mid-July. After its establishment, the Allied military government will be revoked, and the Allied Control Council will only perform supervisory tasks. The basis for today's discussion was a compromise proposal drafted by the German leaders 48 hours after receiving the Allied foreign ministers' notice to relax the constitutional restrictions. This draft agreement still needs to be formally approved by the West German constitutional assembly and the Allied governments, but since the agreement has been established, approval is only a formality. According to U.S. Governor Clay, all differences between the occupying authorities and Germany on the West German constitution have been resolved. The constitution is expected to be passed by the constitutional assembly on May 15th, and the German government is expected to be established around mid-July. The full text of the constitution will be published by the constitutional assembly and the military governors in two or three days. Berlin is not included in West Germany, but it may still participate in the future. When asked if today's agreement has closed the possibility of the four powers reaching an agreement on Germany, Clay replied that it has not changed in terms of the four powers conducting negotiations. When asked when he will step down as the military governor of Germany, Clay replied that he hopes to still be here on May 15th when the constitution is established. In short, this agreement was not easy to obtain and is a solution that makes all parties involved happy.

### Full Text of the Three Powers' West German Agreement Released Yesterday

[Our Newspaper News] Washington, 26th broadcast: The full text of the West German Agreement signed by the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and France, Bevin, Acheson, and Schuman, on April 8th was released today (26th). The agreement stipulates that when the West German government is established, the Allied High Commission will be the highest-level joint Allied agency for the administration of West Germany. The agreement also stipulates that the three occupying zones of Britain, the United States, and France will be merged before the implementation of the occupation regulations. The powers of the High Commission will not conflict with the occupation regulations and international treaties. In order to make the West German government more responsible for domestic affairs and reduce occupation costs, the number of personnel of the High Commission will be reduced as much as possible. The High Commission's resolutions on amending the constitution must be passed unanimously by all members, but resolutions on other issues can be passed by a majority vote.

### Far East Fleet Increases Strength; British Navy Department Issues Statement; Plans to Withdraw as Soon as the Environment Permits

[Reuters, London, 25th] The Navy Department issued a formal statement today clarifying the mission of British warships in China, saying that British warships in Nanjing and Shanghai are solely responsible for assisting the British Commonwealth people in the event of social unrest during the change of regime. As soon as the environment permits, it plans to withdraw the British fleet and restore the normal procedure of warships visiting foreign ports.

The Navy Department also announced that the Fiji-class cruiser "Jamaica" with a displacement of 8,000 tons, led by Captain Barons, has been ordered to sail from Bermuda to the Far East. The ship is equipped with nine 6-inch guns and will sail to the Far East at the highest speed. The exact date of departure has not been determined. There are a total of six Fiji-class cruisers, namely "Gambia," "Bermuda," "Kenya," "Mauritius," and "Nigeria." Normally, each ship has a crew of 730 people, which increases to 980 people in wartime. In addition to nine 6-inch guns, it is also equipped with eight 4-inch high-angle guns, four 3-pounder mortars, sixteen to forty-one 40mm anti-aircraft machine guns, and six 21-inch torpedo tubes.

[Associated Press, London, 25th] Officials declared today that although Britain plans to reinforce the Far East Fleet, it will try its best to avoid conflict with the Chinese Communist forces. Hong Kong originally stationed two cruisers, eight destroyers, and four small warships. It is now planned to add two aircraft carriers, one cruiser, and several submarines, but it does not plan to send troops to Hong Kong to avoid being misunderstood as a provocative act. British Ambassador to China Stevenson also plans to establish a relationship with the Chinese Communist authorities in Nanjing to facilitate action.

### British Secret Review of Future Naval Tactics

[Reuters, London, 25th] British Commonwealth and U.S. military leaders began a secret review of naval tactics in the atomic age at the Greenwich Naval School in London today. More than 400 senior military officers, scientists, and others participated in this indoor exercise. The school surroundings were tightly guarded to maintain the absolute confidentiality of this indoor exercise. Everything related to the defense of the British Commonwealth supply lines and the future naval warfare tactics, weapons, strategies, tactics, and doctrines are all under thorough review.

### French Paratroopers Deploy to Recover Lost Territory on the Sino-Vietnamese Border

[Reuters, Saigon, 25th] A French military communique said that French paratroopers deployed today to recover two key points of the Viet Minh army 60 miles east of Lao Cai. At this point, the French army has completely recovered all the lost territory on the Sino-Vietnamese border.

### U.S. Senate Begins Deliberation on the North Atlantic Defense Treaty

[United Press, Washington, 25th] The U.S. Senate has begun deliberating on the North Atlantic Treaty. Most senators apparently favor approving the treaty, but in general, senators understand that this treaty involves an unprecedented precedent in U.S. history and a fateful resolution, so it must be thoroughly analyzed and debated. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee now plans to widely hear opinions from all parties on this treaty. Some well-informed senators believe that 12 to 20 of the 96 senators will oppose this treaty. The treaty must be approved by a two-thirds majority before it can be ratified. The main reason that can promote the Senate's approval of this treaty is that the Soviet Union's foreign policy and the goal of world revolution have created a real threat to the peace and internal security of the United States and Western European democracies.

### Signs of a Shift in British and French Policy Toward Spain

[United Press, London, 25th] Diplomatic circles here believe that Britain has begun to adopt a softer attitude towards Spain. A Foreign Office spokesman said on the 25th that the British government's attitude towards Spain is the same as that outlined by Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Mayhew last month. But all parties pointed out that even if Mr. Mayhew's statement indicated a slight softening of Britain's position, it meant no longer opposing the restoration of diplomatic relations with Spain. The London Times and the Daily Telegraph claimed on the 25th that in view of the Cold War, it is necessary to strengthen relations with Spain. At the same time, the military has also increased pressure to expand the Atlantic Treaty and draw in Spain. According to news from Paris, officials there also feel the same way, believing that the time has come to change relations with Spain.

### Preliminary Talks Begin to Resolve the British-Dutch Dispute

[Associated Press, Batavia, 26th] A spokesman for the Republic of Indonesia reiterated today that the restoration of the Yogyakarta government is a prerequisite for resolving the British-Dutch dispute. He wondered why the Netherlands did not implement the United Nations Security Council resolution and instead made various restrictions on us, such as requiring us to stop guerrilla warfare and participate in the Hague Round Table Conference. The Netherlands should know that this condition is unacceptable to the Indonesian government. At the same time, Indonesian Prime Minister Hatta arrived in Batavia yesterday to guide the Indonesian delegation's negotiations with the Netherlands. Hatta and Dutch representative Van Royen held an informal meeting today with the American representative of the United Nations Mediation Commission.

### Soviet-Japanese War; 400,000 Not Yet Repatriated; Allied Headquarters Asks the Soviet Union to Provide Information

[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] MacArthur's foreign affairs official recently formally wrote to Soviet representative in Tokyo Terevjanko, requesting the Soviet Union to provide "all possible" information about the deaths, missing persons, and seriously ill Japanese prisoners of war still in Soviet territory, and pointed out that Moscow has not provided this information, and the Supreme Commander is very concerned about this matter when implementing the Japanese surrender conditions and the Potsdam Declaration. This letter was signed by Sebald, chairman of the Allied Control Council for Japan and the U.S. member. Terevjanko is the Soviet member of the council. The letter requested Mr. Terevjanko to try to obtain the necessary information from the Soviet government. It is estimated that although MacArthur's headquarters has stepped up efforts to repatriate Japanese prisoners of war in Soviet territory, more than 400,000 Japanese prisoners of war are still being detained in Soviet-controlled areas. The repatriation of Japanese people from the U.S.-controlled areas in the Western Pacific and the Far East was officially announced on January 8, 1947.

### India Maintains Ties with the Commonwealth, Not Hindering Independent Status, London Conference to Issue Joint Declaration

[Reuters, London, 25th] Reliable sources report that Commonwealth leaders, after holding a secret meeting here today, have reached an agreement in principle to consider issuing a joint declaration. This declaration will establish the basis for a free association of the Commonwealth, allowing India to remain a member of the Commonwealth after becoming a republic.

The Commonwealth Prime Ministers held two meetings today to find a formula enabling the Republic of India to participate in the Commonwealth. They held a two-hour secret meeting in the afternoon, followed by a second meeting at 8:00 PM. It is understood that in the joint declaration, India and other Dominions will continue to recognize the special status of the British monarch as a symbol of the free association of the Commonwealth. However, India differs from other Dominions in that it does not pledge allegiance to the British monarch. The reaction of various Dominions to this proposal is not yet known. However, it is understood that India emphasized the following three points when promising to continue participating in the Commonwealth: (1) Cooperation within the Commonwealth must not hinder the complete independence of the Republic of India; (2) Although India continues to participate in the Commonwealth, it cannot be bound to participate in military alliances that the Commonwealth joins; (3) According to Commonwealth tradition, international policy issues will be handled on a case-by-case basis depending on their importance.

[United Press, London, 26th] The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference is seeking a way to maintain the symbol of the Crown while satisfying India's desire to become a republic. However, disagreements between India and Pakistan caused cautious sentiment on the 26th. The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference held its fourth plenary session at 10 Downing Street today. Delegates still hope to resolve remaining differences by the evening of the 27th. At this stage, a general approach seems to have been reached that would allow India, with its republican system, to remain affiliated with the Commonwealth, but Pakistan has some objections. Bevin met with Palestinian representatives on the 25th, and Prime Minister Attlee later held private talks with Pakistani Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, which must have been of great significance. It is rumored that Khan has indicated that if India insists on a special status within the Commonwealth, the Pakistani government opposes sharing joint defense with India. Another disagreement between Pakistan and India is reportedly related to the Kashmir issue, with Pakistan suspecting Indian involvement in the increased western border insurgency.

### ### Bunche Likely to be Appointed U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, Responsible for Near East and African Affairs

[United Press, London, 26th] United Nations Acting Mediator for Palestine, Ralph Bunche, is likely to be appointed as U.S. Assistant Secretary of State. The State Department has requested Congress to approve the addition of four Assistant Secretaries of State. Bunche will be one of the four, and Gaulker will be responsible for Near East and African affairs or United Nations affairs. Bunche will be the first Black person to hold a senior government position.

### ### Asian Nations Should Organize a Non-Communist Bloc, Romulo Advocates

[United Press, Manila, 26th] The Philippines' Chief Delegate to the United Nations, Carlos Romulo, advocated on the 26th for the organization of a non-communist, rather than an anti-communist, group of Asian nations, as a "catalyst between two hostile philosophies." In a speech at the graduation ceremony of the University of the Philippines, he stated, "The concentration of American power in Europe makes it imperative for free Asian nations to unite closely to guarantee their security and common defense of freedom." He also stated that Asia can assist in achieving a temporary truce and lasting peace in a world divided by ideological conflict. He summarized the concept of this Asian nations' group as follows: (1) Asian nations form a group in mutual assistance, negotiating the paths to future peace, tolerance, and freedom. (2) Not exclusive in nature, nor hostile in belief. (3) Not adopting a flattering or self-deprecating attitude towards any nation or group of nations. (4) "Non-Communist" but not "Anti-Communist." (5) Based on the democratic principles of recently evolved free societies.

### ### Japanese Workers Prepare for May Day Parade

[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] Japanese labor unions have announced that they will use the large-scale May Day parade as a springboard to resist the Allied Headquarters' directive regarding the "Austerity Export Plan." They estimate that 600,000 workers in the Tokyo area alone will participate in the parade and demonstrations. The unions will use this parade to organize resistance against MacArthur's plan to reduce wages in state-owned and private industries, balance the budget, promote industrial production, and expand Japanese exports. Left-wing and right-wing unions, as well as civil service unions (representing approximately six million members), have announced that they will participate in the parade. The May Day parade will call on all workers to join a united front, overthrow the Yoshida government, oppose the proposed strengthening of labor laws, and demand a minimum wage system. The main attacks will focus on "opposing the austerity export plan based on low wages" and "the government and enterprises' restructuring plans through the dismissal of large numbers of personnel."

### ### UN Urges Soviet Union to Respect Marriage Rights, Should Not Refuse Soviet Brides to Leave the Country

[U.S. Information Service, Flushing Meadow, 25th] The United Nations General Assembly has requested the Soviet Union to allow Soviet wives of foreign nationals to leave the Soviet Union and follow their husbands overseas. This proposal, originating from a complaint by Chile, was voted on today, with 39 votes in favor, 6 against, 11 abstentions, and 2 absences. The opposing votes were all cast by the Soviet bloc. During a full-day debate on the issue, Soviet representative Sharapkin called the Chilean complaint a "low-level farce." Eleanor Roosevelt, speaking for the U.S. delegation, recounted that while this proposal had been passed by the General Assembly's Legal Committee at the Paris Conference in December of last year by an "overwhelming majority," the Soviet Union has refused to issue exit permits to 65 Soviet husbands of American citizens and 350 Soviet wives who wish to leave the Soviet Union.

### ### U.S. "Atomic Bomb" Air Group to be Deployed to Europe for Training, Change of Commander of U.S. Far East Air Forces

[United Press, London, 25th] According to Air Force officials on the 25th, the renowned 5009th "Atomic Bomb" Air Group will arrive in England on the 30th to train at a front-line Atlantic Treaty base there. The group is specially equipped and its pilots are specially trained. The group has 30 aircraft. After the group is stationed in England, the United States will have a strategic position to drop atomic bombs anywhere in Europe.

[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] Lieutenant General Stratemeyer is scheduled to arrive here on the 27th to succeed as Commander of the Far East Air Forces. The former commander, Lieutenant General Whitehead, will return to the United States to serve as Commander of the Air Force at Hempstead, Long Island, in a position swap with Stratemeyer. Stratemeyer served as Commander of the U.S. Air Force in China in 1945. The area under his command this time extends from Hokkaido in northern Japan to Clark Air Base in Manila in the south, including the Mariana Islands, the Kuril Islands, and the Bonin Islands, with an outer line stretching 2,000 miles.

### Communist Suspects in Various Schools to be Centrally Managed by the Garrison Department, List of 352 People Announced

[Central News Agency] According to a spokesperson for the Garrison Department: (1) The Garrison Headquarters has compiled a list of communist suspects in various schools, who have been shown to be involved in encouraging or leading illegal organizations, singing reactionary songs, performing Yangko dances, posting reactionary slogans on wall posters, and shouting reactionary slogans. The list was sent to each school on the morning of the 26th to hand over the individuals for centralized management, and notices were posted in each school.

[Our Reporter] The Shanghai-Suzhou section of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway resumed normal traffic yesterday. Passengers arriving in Shanghai from Suzhou all said: Suzhou is unusually peaceful, and shops are still open for business. The Shanghai-Hangzhou line is unobstructed, and all stations are peaceful.

### Population Evacuation Executive Office Officially Established Today

It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Population Census and Evacuation Joint Executive Office has been fully organized by the Garrison Headquarters in conjunction with the Municipal Government Council and other relevant agencies and will be officially established today.

In addition to conducting surprise inspections during the day at public entertainment venues and major transportation routes, attention will be focused on inspections during curfew hours at night, targeting high-rise buildings, hotels, and refugee areas.

### Songhu Garrison Department Issues Open Letter to Citizens on Population Evacuation Yesterday

[Central News Agency] According to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters' open letter to citizens on the evacuation of the Shanghai population, the following precautions for evacuation are stipulated: (1) Make full use of personal means of transportation. (2) Relevant agencies will provide convenience for taking ships and trains. (3) Exit inspection procedures should be simplified as much as possible.

### 100,000 Yuan Bills Issued, Prices Stir Again, Manufacturers No Longer Firmly Reject Bank Drafts, Returned Checks Account for 20% of Exchange Volume

[Our Reporter] Yesterday, the Central Bank announced the issuance of 100,000 yuan banknotes. Funds from all parties were settled after two days. The situation turned slightly better, so prices stirred again. Financial items such as gold, banknotes, and silver dollars, in particular, had been suppressed for many days, so their prices rose strongly. Cash chips remain scarce. However, as the Central Bank concentrates all its efforts on coping with the disbursement of funds for the central military and political organs in Shanghai and the allocation of huge emergency funds for various business units, the amount of cash withdrawn from the Bank by various firms yesterday was still 10% of the previous day's balance. However, a considerable amount of cash obtained by all parties is also flowing back into the market, so the cash crunch has eased slightly.

Regarding bank draft transactions, the City Chamber of Commerce and the City Industrial Association jointly announced that they should be maintained, and various factories and shops must not refuse to accept them. Many parties also believe that refusing to accept bank drafts is not only a matter of unnecessary self-disturbance but also borders on disrupting the financial system, and the authorities will punish them accordingly. Therefore, from yesterday onwards, various parties have no longer firmly refused to buy and sell with bank drafts. However, general retail prices have risen by several percent to one-fold because the discount rate for bank drafts has been rekindled and yesterday's general prices have improved again.

Currently, the situation of check clearing in this city is that all parties have made preparations in advance, and fortunately, there has not been a repeat of the 40-50% return rate. The amount of returned checks on this day accounted for about 20% of the exchange amount.

### Gold Prices Slightly Stabilized

[Our Reporter] Yesterday's gold market conditions were more stable than the previous day. Because major players have left Shanghai one after another, they have no intention of trading. Retail investors have limited strength and are only making scattered transactions. The market is calm and there are no major changes.

Spot prices outside the market were initially quoted at 40 million and 45 million, and then gradually declined. Halfway through the day, prices were transacted at 320 million and 370 million. The final quotes near noon were only transacted at 280 million and 330 million.

The U.S. dollar market was even more chaotic. No official trading was heard. Quotes were 700,000 for bidding and 750,000 for asking. The above were all settled with current bank drafts. Gold was exchanged for silver dollars, and prices dropped as low as 340,000 and 370,000.

### Silver Dollars Rise Madly

[Our Reporter] Silver dollars rose madly again on the street yesterday. Because emergency funds from all parties continued to flow out in large quantities, and the market was active, and because the situation turned stable, the holders were unwilling to easily sell. Under conditions of short supply and strong demand, the market rose sharply. Silver dollars rose from 430,000 and 480,000 in the morning to 600,000 and 650,000 at noon.

However, in yesterday's various industry markets, some have returned to normal. It is possible that gold jewelry trading will resume today. Other money exchange businesses have not resumed posting prices for trading either.

### Secret Organization Uncovered in Lotus Temple: Eighty-Four Arrested, Ringleader Caught on the Spot, Over Three Hundred Accomplices Escape

[Our Report] Mr. Yao, the section chief of the Fifth Section of the Municipal Police Bureau's Criminal Division, received intelligence yesterday shortly after 1:00 PM that a secret organization was set up in Lotus Temple at No. 36 South Chengdu Road, and that a gathering was taking place with a purpose. He personally led police officers, together with all the police officers of the Judicial Section of the Lujiawan Branch Bureau, and rushed there in police vehicles. On the spot, they captured more than sixty people, seized more than twenty handguns, and one jeep, and brought them back to the police station. After strict interrogation, they confessed that they had accomplices in a certain place in the southern part of the city.

The ringleaders, Tong Baifu and Mr. Liu, who claimed to be major general group leaders, were captured on the spot. The police bureau is now conducting a detailed investigation, and it is learned that there are still more than three hundred accomplices at large, and they are currently being pursued.

### The Shanghai Stock Market Weakens

[Our Report] The Shanghai stock market situation was still sparse yesterday. Only the popular stocks saw closing transactions, and many unpopular stocks still did not resume trading. After the sudden turn of events, people are disheartened, and the overall trend is uniformly pessimistic. Capital within the industry is scattered, and capital outside the industry is also tightening. Small investors are mostly liquidating, and short positions are covering. The market softened immediately after opening. In the middle, the face was repeatedly supported, and the quoted prices were slightly higher, but people were mostly not optimistic and selling at higher prices was particularly strong. Absorption was blocked, and the trend was idle.

Yong Yarn opened in the morning at 310 yuan, with strong surface support, rising to 330 yuan. Bank groups sold, and retail investors followed, falling all the way to 250 yuan. Securities firms absorbed at lower prices, and near the close, there was a slight rebound, closing at 275 yuan.

There are few manipulators of small and medium-sized stocks. Those behind the scenes came forward to maintain them, and the close was uniquely strong. Meiya opened in the morning at 6 yuan, reaching 6 yuan 8 jiao. Along the way, there was more selling than buying, falling to 5 yuan 5 jiao. Near the close, buying interest turned strong and returned to a high closing price. Xinguang debuted at 8 yuan 4 jiao, pushing up to the daily limit of 9 yuan 3 jiao. Later, because there were not many transactions, it ended at a high price near the close. Jingfu saw highs after opening, but lacked support near the close, turning into a weak position, finally closing at 5 yuan 3 jiao. Xinnuoqin and Jinglun did not resume trading. Among the miscellaneous stocks, only China-France China Ceramics National Products Taiwan Sugar Rongfeng and other five varieties saw some trading. The rest did not see any transactions.

In the afternoon market, Yong Yarn initially traded at 285 yuan, falling all the way to a close of 248 yuan, a further squeeze compared to the morning market. Xinguang initially traded at 8 yuan 8 jiao, closing at the same daily limit as the morning. Jingfu saw softness after opening, and the late close was a further slight 3 jiao lower than the morning price. Meiya's late close was 6 yuan, still a slight 8 jiao lower than the afternoon price. China-France continued to fall in the afternoon market, finally closing at the limit down.

### Yarn Market Stalled

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market continued to be stalled, and all parties remained in a wait-and-see attitude, due to the impact of the suspension of bill discounting by firms.

### Cloth Market Idle

The cloth market is still firm, as people are slightly more stable, and credit is showing signs of easing. Various cloths opened at high prices. Later, because transactions and payments were all based on same-day bank drafts, and especially since same-day bank drafts from firms could absolutely not be discounted, there were difficulties in cash flow turnover, and customer demand was very light. Therefore, the trend went from high to loose, and transactions were also few.

Longtou fine cloth opened at 3.7 million, once slightly lively to 3.8 million, suddenly plunged near noon to 3 million. The noon close was 3.1 million, up 1.1 million from last weekend. Four Gentlemen Serge opened in the morning at 3.6 million, reaching a maximum of 3.8 million, once forced into the 3 million level in the middle. The noon close was on par with Longtou fine cloth. The remaining cloths lacked trading.

### Rice Market Mostly Priced in Silver Dollars, White Rice Sees Another Decline

The rice market saw more transactions yesterday, all priced in terms of conversion to Yuan silver dollars. Most cargo owners were settling accounts due to the current situation, and selling to get silver, so there were many sellers, and prices declined. White rice opened at 5 yuan 5 jiao and closed at 5 yuan. Thin rice closed at 5 yuan 1 jiao. Early rice was 4 yuan 8 jiao, each down 5 jiao. However, because the price of silver dollars rose, combined with the price of bank drafts, it still saw an increase. The market quoted white rice and thin rice at 2.5 million, early rice at 2.3 million, each up 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.

Edible oil transactions were more than the previous day. Prices were quoted in both silver dollars and bank drafts. Soybean oil in silver dollars was 20 yuan, down 7 yuan. The bank draft prices were 20 million and 24 million yuan, showing an increase. Rapeseed oil was 16 yuan 5 jiao in silver dollars. Rapeseed oil's bank draft price was 20 million. Soybean cake was not quoted.

There were only actual sales transactions in flour. There was not much trading, because there were few buyers. The price was converted to silver dollars. Lao Che brand closed at 1 yuan 4 jiao, and Bingshun brand was 1 yuan 2 jiao, both down from the previous day's price. Bank draft transactions were not opened.

Trade in miscellaneous grains was as sluggish as ever. Those priced in silver dollars mostly declined. Mulberry field beans were 3 yuan 6 jiao. Selected green beans were 4 yuan 5 jiao. Corn and raw peanuts were rarely quoted. White hemp was quoted at 10 yuan, yellow hemp was 8 yuan, but there were no transactions.

### Foreign Stocks and Bonds Without a Market
