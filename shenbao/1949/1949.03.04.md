### Shanghai is the Essence of the Whole Country: The Communist Army Will Not Attack. Future Life May Have Considerable Changes. Yan and Others Responded to a Banquet Invited by Pan Gongzhan and Others Yesterday.

[This Newspaper's Report] Yesterday noon, Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Xu Jiliu, Deputy Speaker, Du Yuesheng, President of the Local Association, Qian Xinzhi, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Communications, and Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, hosted a luncheon at Du's residence to welcome the three peace elders, Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, and Jiang Yong, who had just flown from Beijing to Shanghai. They represented the citizens of Shanghai in expressing their sincere appreciation. Although Mr. Du was ill yesterday, he still personally engaged in a lengthy conversation. There were no other people present, and they exchanged opinions with each other, all holding a strong belief in peaceful resolution. Although the three members of the peace delegation have maintained silence and refrained from divulging information since arriving in Shanghai, this newspaper's reporter has gleaned from their conversations a rough outline of future peace talks. The noteworthy points are: (1) The number of representatives for peace talks between the government and the CCP should be the same, in order to brainstorm ideas and allow both sides to fully discuss matters. It may even exceed four people per side. (2) Zhang Qun's repeated participation in important consultations after arriving in Beijing may be a symbolic indication that the government will appoint Mr. Zhang as one of the peace talk representatives. (3) The government must first seek internal unity and become a cohesive whole, which will make peace talks easier to conduct. (4) The terms of the peace talks will naturally have to wait until the talks begin and be negotiated between the two sides. The task of this peace delegation is to "knock on the door" and will not involve this scope. (5) Shanghai is the location of the nation's industrial and commercial essence. Destroying Shanghai will inevitably harm the nation's vitality, a point that both sides generally recognize. Furthermore, it appears that the CCP leaders have not considered attacking Shanghai by force. (6) Regardless, the way of life for the people will likely undergo considerable changes in the future. However, the CCP's conduct in larger cities they have occupied, such as Jinan, Beiping, and Tianjin, appears to differ from their previous conduct in inland cities and rural areas.

### Peace Talks to Proceed on an Equal Footing, May Begin in Mid-Month, Government Designates Ten People to Draft Plan, President Sun Receives Reporters and Explains Current Issues

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd Day] President of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, formally announced on the morning of the 3rd that peace negotiations between the government and the CCP would begin after the 15th of this month, and that the government is currently stepping up its efforts to study a peace plan. Mr. Sun stated that the Shanghai People's Peace Delegation, Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, Zhang Shizhao, and Shao Lizi, returned from Beiping and conveyed the CCP's view that they are willing to conduct peace talks with the government on an equal footing. For example, the CCP is willing to have an equal number of representatives for peace talks as the government. CCP officials have also indicated that it would be best to begin peace talks after March 15th. For this reason, Acting President Li specially convened a meeting of central and local leaders at 4 PM on the 1st of this month and designated ten people to be responsible for studying and drafting the government's peace plan. The research is currently underway and is expected to be completed within ten days. These ten key members are: Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Qun, He Yingqin, Wu Zhongxin, Zhu Jiahua, Liu Fei, Wu Tiecheng, Zhong Tianxin, and Sun Ke, with Sun Ke serving as chairman. Mr. Sun emphasized that this plan is still under research and its contents have not yet been determined. However, to avoid misunderstandings and affecting peace talks, it is not convenient to publicly disclose it until it has been presented to the CCP and formally agreed upon.

Mr. Sun, at the request of reporters from various newspapers in the capital, held a press conference lasting one and a half hours at the International Recreation Club at 10:30 AM on the 3rd, explaining several important current issues, with particular emphasis on the peace issue. He also answered questions from the reporters. Vice President Wu Tiecheng, Deputy Foreign Minister Ye Gongchao, and others participated in the press conference. More than forty Chinese and foreign reporters attended. Mr. Sun's report included (1) the peace process and (2) the issue of political reform. Regarding political reform, Mr. Sun listed military service, grain administration, currency value, land reform, and other items, explaining each in detail.

The peace process is the issue of greatest concern to the people at present, and Mr. Sun first described its progress in detail. Mr. Sun stated that last month, Acting President Li went to Shanghai to invite Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, and Zhang Shizhao, as well as Shao Lizi from the government side, to go to Beiping. They have now returned to the capital. I have come to Beijing from Guangzhou and have met with the four and heard their reports. I am not at liberty to disclose the contents, as everything is still under discussion and preparation and has not yet reached the stage for public disclosure. Yan and the other three met with key CCP officials in Beiping and Shijiazhuang and obtained extremely valuable information and brought new hope. Although there are many difficulties in the future of peace, there is great hope. Both sides now understand that the fate and future of the country will be determined by the extent of their efforts towards peace. When I presided over the Executive Yuan two months ago, I advocated for peace negotiations. Eight years of resistance war and three years of civil war have led to continuous warfare, and the people cannot bear their suffering. The biggest issue going forward is how to find ways to achieve the goal of peace. In the Executive Yuan, my colleagues and I, under the leadership of President Chiang, consulted several times. Later, President Chiang, based on everyone's opinions and his own considerations, believed that China needed peace and issued a New Year's Day message advocating for peace. President Chiang's New Year's Day message indicated that the government was prepared and determined to seek peace through political means. Half a month later, we learned of CCP Chairman Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation, in which he mentioned eight conditions. At that time, the government's hesitation and concerns were that the government side was experiencing military defeats and the CCP side was experiencing military victories. We were concerned that the CCP would see itself as the victor and the government as the defeated party, adopting international practice, where peace terms are proposed by the victorious country and the defeated country can only obey without the right to offer opinions. If that were the case, there would be many difficulties in peace, and it would not be easy to overcome. Therefore, I proposed a simple idea at the time: we should achieve a glorious peace, meaning that both sides should negotiate on an equal footing and be able to propose conditions and exchange opinions and debate without limitations, so as to achieve a result. Only by negotiating on an equal footing can the results be fair and reasonable, and both sides can be convinced and accept them together. This time, the peace delegation returned from Beiping and explained that the CCP truly has the sincerity to seek peace and also has this understanding, that is, both sides will negotiate peace on an equal footing. The CCP stated that both sides are currently preparing and hope to begin negotiations after the 15th of this month. The government is also stepping up its preparations based on this point.

### Prince De Visits Ningxia

[This Newspaper, Lanzhou, 3rd Day] Prince De, who had been staying in Lanzhou for a short time, took a special train to Ningxia on the morning of the 3rd for a visit, accompanied by Mongolian legislator Zhao Nasutu and others.

### Legislative Yuan Meeting to Be Held Today to Discuss Promoting National Peace Proposal, Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng Invite All Legislators in Beijing to Banquet

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd Day] The second meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held at 9 AM on the morning of the 4th. The items for discussion include a proposal by Zhang Huiwen and others to hold a plenary talk to discuss how to promote national peace. In addition, Xiao Juetian and twelve others proposed that the government's four declarations on protecting the people's basic freedoms and releasing political prisoners, etc., be confirmed in advance as necessary measures. They stated that the government issued four declarations on January 23rd, namely, the lifting of martial law, protecting the people's personal freedom, prohibiting illegal arrests and detentions, protecting freedom of speech, prohibiting the arbitrary closure of newspapers, abolishing special organizations and special courts, releasing students and political prisoners, restoring the status of the China Democratic League, and releasing Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng, etc. These are all things that the Legislative Yuan has been seeking and that the people of the whole country desire. However, they have not been effectively implemented to date, or because of procedural issues, administrative efficiency has been reduced, and even special agents continue to arrest people outside of legal procedures, disregarding laws and orders to the extreme. As the Legislative Yuan resumes its sessions, in order to fight for freedom for the people, the Legislative Yuan should confirm in advance the four declarations of the government as necessary measures and order the Executive Yuan to be responsible for their effective implementation. If any military or political leaders violate these orders again, they should be dismissed and punished in order to appease the public's grievances and make the laws respected.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd Day] Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng hosted a banquet for all the legislators in Beijing at the International Recreation Club at noon on the 3rd, with more than two hundred people attending. Mr. Sun made a statement on the Executive Yuan's move to Guangzhou and reiterated his confidence in striving for peace, saying that the people urgently need peace, and the government will make its greatest efforts towards peace in order to comply with public opinion. As long as there can be a genuine and glorious peace, the sacrifice of individual and party interests will not be considered. In order to achieve this goal, the whole country must unite in order to strive for the realization of glorious peace. Tong Guanxian, Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, was also invited to attend. He made a speech on the spot, expressing his agreement with Mr. Sun's determination to strive for peace, and said that peace must be constructive, and political reform should be carried out simultaneously with peace. The banquet did not end until 2 PM.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd Day] The anti-Sun Ke sentiment among the legislators is still very strong, and it was fully expressed at the second talk held by the legislators at 3 PM on the 3rd. This talk was jointly convened by Huang Yuren, Gan Jiaxin, Jiang Yiping, Chen Bosheng, Fan Yusui, Fei Xia, Liu Bomin, Tang Ruyan, Chen Guyuan, and others. Two hundred legislators attended, and Jiang Yiping chaired the meeting. Some people advocated sending a letter to Sun Ke, asking him to "resign honorably," but this motion failed to pass because the legislators' opinions were not entirely the same. It is generally expected that they will still follow "legal procedures" and question him in the Legislative Yuan when Mr. Sun reports on the government's policies. The mood at the talk on the 3rd was quite heated, with twenty-four people speaking, analyzing the two issues of peace talks and political reform, but no conclusions were reached. In the end, it was only decided to have the Legislative Yuan pass a resolution on the 4th to send a telegram to the whole country to support Acting President Li's peace proposal. Regarding the peace issue, it was decided to exchange opinions extensively before making a proposal. This proposal must first be submitted for review, and the details of the peace will be discussed after the peace talks begin. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM.

### Supervisory Committee of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces Protests to the Garrison Headquarters, Stating That It Violates Constitutional Provisions

[This Newspaper's Report] After this newspaper exposed the major conspiracy to subvert the government, people from all walks of life have paid great attention to it and expressed shock. However, the Supervisory Committee of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces regrets that the handling of the case by law enforcement agencies in terms of procedures may be inappropriate. It is reported that the Supervisory Committee has submitted a formal protest to the Capital Garrison Headquarters. According to Ni Bi, a supervisor of the Supervisory Committee, when the chief of the investigation department of the Capital Garrison Headquarters arrested Xu Zhiyuan, he led military police into the Supervisory Committee's office at night, scaling the walls, and took him away. He also searched and took away three official documents of the Supervisory Committee. He did not produce an arrest warrant, nor did he inform the person in charge of the Supervisory Committee of the reasons for the arrest and provide a receipt, nor did he transfer him to a court with jurisdiction for trial within the statutory time limit. Mr. Ni stated that this "clearly violates the provisions of the Constitution, the Habeas Corpus Act, and the Criminal Procedure Law." As for Xu Zhiyuan himself, he was introduced to the Supervisory Committee when it was established last September, and he was appointed as a recommended investigator only after he obtained a guarantee in accordance with the law. His words and deeds were normal on weekdays, and whether he participated in the "conspiracy to subvert the government" should be determined based on evidence in accordance with the law. In addition to conducting an investigation into the truth, the Supervisory Committee will not comment for the time being. At the same time, Mr. Ni stated that the Supervisory Committee does not have a person named Meng Shiheng, who is one of the people involved in the case, as has been rumored.

It also said that the U.S. Military Joint Advisory Group in China was ordered to retain its name and not return to the United States, but to work temporarily in Tokyo, as another clear proof of aid to the Kuomintang.

Editorial

### The Aid to China Suggestions of Mr. Lapham

Mr. Lapham, Director of the China Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, returned to the United States on the 15th of last month to report on the work of the China Branch to the Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration, Mr. Hoffman. Although this is a normal event, the question of whether the United States will continue to aid China in today's turbulent political situation is of the utmost concern to the people of the whole country. Therefore, we have unlimited expectations for Mr. Lapham's return to his country to report on his work. In addition, the term of the current aid-to-China program is about to expire, and the remaining aid-to-China funds are also small. Mr. Lapham's return to his country is now almost half a month, and no concrete indications have been seen from Mr. Lapham, which has increased the urgent concern of the Chinese people about whether US aid will continue.

But until yesterday, Mr. Lapham finally broke his silence and put forward his suggestions for continuing aid to China. According to a United Press report from Washington on the 1st, Mr. Lapham has suggested to the Economic Cooperation Administration in Washington that it immediately submit a request to Congress for an economic cooperation loan of US$240 million to the Chinese people. The term of this aid-to-China program is still set at one year, calculated at US$20 million per month, from June 30 this year to June 30 next year, requiring a total expenditure of US$240 million. At the same time, Mr. Lapham himself also told the press: "I am eager to attend Congress and ask for continued aid to China; but this economic cooperation program is not military aid. As long as the region where we are currently located does not fall into the hands of the CCP, we should continue to carry out aid to China. The current relief expenses in China are about US$20 million per month. If we decide to adopt a policy of not continuing to operate in any CCP-occupied areas, then we may not need as much as US$240 million in one year."

Although we have not seen the details of Mr. Lapham's continued aid-to-China program, we cannot help but be moved by Mr. Lapham's remarks, which are full of the valuable sympathy of friendly people for the Chinese people. China is a country with a backward industry. Although it has been called "an agricultural country" in the past, it has failed to improve due to its outdated production methods. Even farmers who work hard day and night cannot avoid freezing and starvation, and there is no question of industrialization. In recent years, the eight-year war of resistance and the three-year internal strife have devastated the rural areas, on which the people of the whole country depend for food and clothing, to the point of disrepair, completely changing its appearance compared to ten years ago. Under such circumstances, the Chinese people naturally hope that friendly countries can lend a helping hand. The motive is not to rely on foreign aid to solve the post-war livelihood problems, but its real purpose is to use this as capital for economic revival. However, in the three years after the war, the Chinese people have had another nightmare. The work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in China and the continuous economic aid to China by the US government have failed to save the Chinese people from fire and water. The Chinese people are naturally infinitely guilty and ashamed of their failure to make good use of foreign aid and to turn foreign aid into their own flesh and blood as a basis for future revival. However, they cannot help but express regret for the erratic nature of foreign aid, the insufficient amount of aid, and the fact that the aid goods often do not meet the needs. Therefore, although the Chinese people deeply understand the importance of their own efforts and regard "self-reliance" and "self-help" as golden rules, they still hope for the full assistance of friendly countries. We expressed this wish when Mr. Lapham returned to his country, and we were not disappointed to hear Mr. Lapham's remarks now. But when we study the nature of this aid-to-China program, it is purely a charitable relief program, and at best it is only a kind of "piecemeal" aid.

An economic cooperation fund of US$20 million a month is certainly not a small amount that can be ignored in today's situation where the national economy and people's livelihood are exhausted. However, if we want to use this as capital for our country's economic revival, it still feels like a drop in the bucket. If the aid is limited to this and there is no other assistance, then the economic cooperation fund of US$240 million in this year can only be regarded as a kind of alms from the United States to the suffering Chinese people, and it may not be able to play a role in reviving them. Therefore, we hope that the United States can truly broaden its horizons and never again take a "hot and cold" attitude towards aid to China. If it wants to provide assistance, it should provide full assistance, with both military and economic measures, so as to achieve the purpose of aiding China. Otherwise, piecemeal assistance will still not allow China to plan for economic revival, and it will inevitably delay the overall situation in the future.

When it comes to the issue of US aid to China, everyone admits that there is a common misconception between China and the United States today, that is, in the eyes of Americans, they always feel that China's own efforts are not enough, and they misunderstand that the Chinese people are solely daydreaming about the full assistance of the United States. President Truman once warned China, saying, "US aid cannot replace your own efforts." But in the eyes of the Chinese people, the piecemeal US aid is like a drop in the bucket, and they hope that the United States will be realistic and provide effective assistance. These two opposing views are both too subjective. We hope that China's own efforts can match US aid, and that US aid can also match China's own efforts.

In short, the trend of the United States continuing and expanding aid to China can be seen in Mr. Lapham's suggestions. But we earnestly hope that the full US aid to China will be realized as soon as possible. Do not let the Chinese people feel hot and cold again, and we must also prepare ourselves, work hard, and not ask about the existence or amount of foreign aid, but only save ourselves through hard work!

### Disruption of Traffic on the Yuehan Railway: Wounded Soldiers Cause Trouble at Chenxian Station, Engage in Fierce Fighting with Traffic Police, Resulting in Deaths on Both Sides

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd] Traffic on the Yuehan Railway was announced to be disrupted after 6:00 PM on the 2nd. Southbound trains from Wuchang could only reach north of Chenxian, Hunan, while northbound trains from Guangzhou could only reach the northern border of Yuebei Lechang County (i.e., south of the county). The entire section of the Yuehan Railway within Chenxian is currently blocked by wounded soldiers, preventing trains from passing. According to a responsible person from the Yuehan Railway Bureau, the incident of wounded soldiers attacking the train was due to a freight train carrying commercial goods and livestock, which departed from Wuchang at the end of last month. When it passed through Chenxian on the 1st, it was intercepted by dozens of wounded soldiers who demanded to purchase the oxen on board. The train staff explained that the goods were being transported by the railway bureau on behalf of merchants and that they had no right to sell them. After repeated polite refusals proved ineffective, an argument ensued. However, the train staff outnumbered the wounded soldiers at the time, so the wounded soldiers did not resort to violence, and the train finally arrived in Guangzhou safely on the 2nd. However, the wounded soldiers later gathered more than a hundred wounded soldiers from various wounded soldier hospitals stationed in Chenxian, carrying light machine guns and other weapons, and ambushed near Chenxian Station on the Yuehan Railway on the afternoon of the 2nd. Coincidentally, another passenger train southbound from Wuchang passed through Chenxian at 6:00 PM that day and was surrounded by the ambushing wounded soldiers. The traffic police protecting the passenger train came forward to mediate, but due to some misunderstanding, a shootout broke out. Both sides exchanged machine gun fire and fought fiercely for a long time before gradually subsiding. After the incident, it was found that several passengers on the train had been killed by gunshots, one traffic policeman was killed, and one wounded soldier was killed. The entire Chenxian engineering section of the Yuehan Railway was destroyed, and most of a passenger train was damaged. The Railway Bureau has reported the attack to the authorities. It is reported that the authorities have telegraphed the garrison in Hengyang to go to Chenxian to suppress the situation, and it is expected that north-south rail traffic will be restored by the 4th.

### Situation in Northern Jiangsu Gradually Tightening: Communist Army Attempts to Seize Guazhou, National Army Crosses the River to Reinforce

[Reuters, Nanjing, 3rd] A telegram from Zhenjiang states: 10,000 Communist troops began attacking Sanchahe, south of Yangzhou, today, in an attempt to seize Guazhou, the National Army's bridgehead north of the Yangtze River. A division of the National Army originally stationed in Zhenjiang has crossed the river to reinforce the Guazhou garrison, and the navy has also dispatched ships to the Guazhou river to assist in defense. In another telegram, National Army reconnaissance planes strafed Communist troops concentrated in the triangle between Yangzhou, Taizhou, and Zhenjiang today. (Another telegram) A naval patrol boat was shot at by 100 guerrillas near the port last night.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 3rd] At around 8:00 PM last night, a unit of over a hundred men from the Huaihai Independent Brigade of the Communist Army, carrying a mortar and several light and heavy machine guns, launched a surprise attack on the National Army's position in the area between Shijiaqiao and Sanchahe. The garrison, led by Wang Zuohua, counterattacked, and after a fierce battle of 30 minutes, the Communist troops fled north.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 3rd] According to the Communist People's Daily published in Yangzhou: "In order to open up the Grand Canal line, the People's Liberation Army must liberate various strongholds near the Yangtze River entrance of the canal, including Liuxu and Guazhou, which are under the control of the Kuomintang army."

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 3rd] It is reported that around Yangzhou, a total of 40,000 Communist troops have gathered in recent days. In addition, there are over 10,000 Communist troops on the line from Xiannvmiao to Yiling. The Communist units discovered on the Grand Canal line are the 11th, 12th, and 13th columns. It seems that there are still follow-up troops on the Huaiyin side. Furthermore, the Communist army is also busy mobilizing on the Yangtian Highway near Hongze Lake.

[Our Newspaper, Jiangyin, 3rd] The Communist army in Jingjiang has been rushing to repair roads and bridges in recent days, seemingly preparing for action. The garrison in Bawugang has stepped up its defenses.

### Suzhou City Defense Plan to Divide the City into Five Garrison Districts

Responsibility Assigned to Baojia System to Implement Duty System

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 3rd] Commander Li Baichuan and Chief of Staff Wu Zhenya of the City Defense Headquarters hosted reporters yesterday, stating that since taking over on the 15th of last month, due to the lack of funds and equipment, they have only recently begun to formally carry out the work of maintaining order and security. The headquarters is currently drafting a new city defense plan. It is reported that the city will be divided into five garrison districts, and the Baojia heads under the administrative organs will be responsible for implementing the duty system. Every evening, each garrison district will control several key roads, allowing pedestrians to enter and exit freely, while the rest will be sealed off. During curfew hours, the curfew laws will be thoroughly enforced, so that incidents can be dealt with quickly. In addition, the practice of indiscriminately posting notices of government and family residences will be strictly prohibited. Military dependents must register their housing with the headquarters and await allocation. Furthermore, all documents issued by the previous City Defense Department are invalidated, and those who falsely claim to be officials or spread rumors will be severely punished.

[Our Newspaper, Ningbo, 3rd] In order to suppress bandits in the Siming Mountains, a certain unit of the National Army had completely blockaded all highways, towns, and key water and land transportation routes along the bandit area since last month, prohibiting residents from entering and exiting. This has lasted for more than half a month, causing a severe disruption to the exchange of goods and materials among the residents of the area, leading to serious panic. After the township heads of Yinxi went to the assembly to petition, the head of the stationed troops, recognizing that the mission had been accomplished and concerned about the food supply in the blockade area, lifted the blockade line yesterday, allowing people to enter and exit freely to facilitate the exchange of materials.

### Naval Headquarters in Contact with Chongqing Warship via Telegram: Central Bank Has No Gold Stored on the Ship

Statement from the Director of the Political Warfare Department of the Naval Headquarters

[Central News Agency, This City] News about the Chongqing warship has attracted much attention recently. Major General Tao Diya, Director of the Political Warfare Department of the Naval Headquarters, is currently in Shanghai on business. According to him, the Naval Headquarters is still trying to contact the ship via telegram. The truth will only be known after contact is made. However, many of the reports are inaccurate. For example, the Director of the Operations Department of the headquarters is currently in Nanjing and is not on the ship, and the Central Bank has no gold stored on the ship. Tao also denied the United Press report of a statement by a government naval spokesman in this city, saying that he had never met with reporters from the United Press or made any statements. Regarding the Reuters report of a statement by a crew member of the ship, claiming that he had asked Captain Zheng Tianjie of the Lingfu warship about this news, the captain stated that there were no crew members of the ship currently working as department store clerks in Shanghai. The statement is likely to have been fabricated by someone impersonating a crew member. The warship is currently inquiring with Reuters about this matter.

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday's report contained a news item about the "Chongqing" warship being related to the transport of gold, stating: "Contact has been lost with the naval transport warship Chongqing, and there is much speculation. Some say that the warship is carrying gold and silver dollars from the National Treasury, but the relevant authorities have not acknowledged this. This morning, Ma Deji, director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, and Dong Mu, commander of the First Naval District, jointly visited President Liu of the National Treasury, indicating that the disappearance of the warship is still closely related to the National Treasury," and so on. Yesterday, a spokesman for the National Treasury stated: "All the reported details are untrue. The transport of gold and silver to the south was stopped by the treasury a long time ago in compliance with orders. This morning, Director Ma of the Jiangnan Shipyard and Commander Dong came to the treasury to discuss business related to the shipyard and had no connection with the disappearance of the 'Chongqing' warship."

### Japanese Businesses Eager to Establish Trade Relations with Communist Areas: American Authorities in Tokyo Request Instructions from Washington

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 3rd] An American military headquarters spokesman told Agence France-Presse today that the American military authorities here are currently seeking instructions from Washington on the possibility of establishing trade relations with Communist areas. It is reported that several Japanese businessmen who have already contacted Japanese Communist leaders here, requesting that they write introductions to Shanghai in exchange for economic aid to the Japanese Communist Party, are now eagerly awaiting the resumption of trade with China. According to a spokesman for the Allied General Headquarters, this matter can only be decided by the Department of State. A spokesman for the Japanese Trade Agency stated that the Japanese government is not eager to urge the American authorities to expedite the establishment of trade relations with China under the current circumstances, but we still remember that Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida has repeatedly stated that Japan is willing to trade with the Chinese Communist Party. According to Japanese official sources, several Chinese companies with general offices in Hong Kong and branches in the Northeast have already proposed to the Allied General Headquarters to conduct some form of barter trade between the Communist areas and Japan. It is reported that these companies are willing to exchange soybeans, coal, and salt for Japanese train carriages, textiles, and cement. However, business circles here are deeply afraid that the materials needed by the Communist Party may be rejected by the American authorities for strategic reasons. They believe that resuming trade with China will increase Japan's trade by 30% and greatly contribute to the early completion of Japan's economic recovery plan. They regret that trade between Japan and the areas ruled by the Chinese National Government after the war has been almost non-existent due to the civil war and the unwillingness of the Chinese authorities to engage in this trade. At the same time, they are also afraid that the prices of materials from the Communist side may be too high and doubt what impact the Communist occupation will have on the interests of foreigners in North China, such as mines. They also wonder if there will be any changes in prices.

Hainan has abundant resources, and the benefits of fishing, salt, forestry, and mining are also very rich. In the past, the prototypes of factories, mines, salt fields, and roads were roughly in place, but unfortunately, due to poor security, they were all abandoned. If they can be restored and expanded, the prospects for construction are limitless. Chen said that whether Hainan can be established as a province depends on how everything progresses. He will take office after all preparations are completed. In response to inquiries, Chen sincerely expressed his welcome to overseas Chinese to invest in and develop Hainan, and he will do his best to protect them.

### Old Capital Atmosphere Incorporated into Musical Composition: San Francisco Orchestra Performs "Beiping Hutong" in Shanghai

[United States Information Service San Francisco, 2nd] The musical atmosphere of Beiping city streets from dawn to dusk. Arranged into a musical composition by Avshalomov, it was recently performed by the San Francisco Orchestra in a concert.

This work is titled "Beiping Hutong." Avshalomov rearranged the musical rhythms of the calls of Beiping vendors, barbers, noodle sellers, and other small merchants into a musical composition. These calls are used to attract customers.

Avshalomov said in an interview with reporters: "China is one of the most musically inclined countries in the world. During my many years of residence in China, I have never encountered a person without musical sensibility." He cited the calls of Beiping water carriers as an example to prove this point.

Avshalomov's interest is entirely focused on Chinese music. He spent most of his life in China. He was born in a small village in eastern Siberia, close to the Chinese border, and developed an interest in the music of his neighboring country early in life.

He said: "I am a composer whose life's work is to familiarize Westerners with the extremely varied and rich traditions of Chinese music, a tradition that was established long ago when Europeans were still living in caves."

When performing Avshalomov's musical composition, the San Francisco Orchestra used Chinese musical instruments for the first time.

### President Sun Explains Current Issues (Continued from Page One)

Sun discussed the importance of the nation's difficulties, mainly due to military actions. If peace can be achieved smoothly, other difficulties can be resolved easily. Although the problem is difficult, some difficulties must be solved even before peace is achieved. This solution is the innovation of politics.

Changing Conscription to Voluntary Military Service is Imminent

Otherwise, there is no way to handle finances.

Regarding conscription, Sun pointed out that this is the greatest imposition on the people. Before the War of Resistance, the government, in order to strengthen national defense, formulated the Conscription Law and implemented conscription, which contributed greatly to the victory of the War of Resistance. However, conscription continued after the War of Resistance because it failed to achieve the ideal in reality. The implementation of conscription laws and regulations deteriorated and became oppressive, especially for the rural people. Therefore, colleagues and others advocate abolishing conscription and changing to a voluntary military system. The voluntary system can give people the freedom to choose whether or not to serve in the military, so the conscription system should be abolished. When discussing conscription, Sun also mentioned the huge military expenditure of the government, saying that the proportion of military expenditure in the government budget is the highest in the world, and the burden on the people is also the heaviest. He mentioned that when he first arrived at the Executive Yuan, he was shocked to hear that there were 6.3 million officers and soldiers in the country. He believed that even at the height of the War of Resistance, there were not that many officers and soldiers. However, regardless of whether there are actually this many now, all military pay and provisions are issued according to this number, which the government cannot afford. At that time, he advocated reducing it to 5.8 million people, but the financial and food authorities believed that it still needed to be reduced. Two weeks ago, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Food, and the Chief Accountant planned to reduce it to 4.2 million people. I personally believe that 4.2 million people is still too many, so a week ago, I proposed that the troop strength should be reduced to 2.5 million people. At that time, the discussion did not yield results. The Ministry of National Defense believed that there were too many difficulties, and reducing the troop strength to 4.2 million had already reduced as much as possible. The financial and food authorities believe that it cannot exceed 3 million people at most, otherwise, they will not be able to afford it. This matter has not yet been resolved. Acting President Li recently came to Guangzhou and discussed this matter. Acting President Li felt the same way and believed that it must be reduced, so there was a discussion of military reorganization. Military reform is an urgent task for the government, otherwise, there is no way to handle finances, the burden on the people cannot be reduced, prices cannot be stabilized, and inflation cannot be stopped.

Abolish the Grain Levy System, Elect Local Leaders

The Land Law should be thoroughly implemented.

In addition to conscription, there are two other things that plague the people: one is the Grain Land Law should be thoroughly implemented, and the other is the value of currency. Sun said: During the War of Resistance, in order to replenish military food, grain was levied and borrowed, and the malpractices have been endless since then. The burden on rural areas is heavy, and tens of thousands of "grain officials" have been created out of thin air, but the amount is less than half of the military food, and the government still needs to pay for it. This system not only oppresses the people, but also makes the government feel wasteful, so it is decided to abolish it. At present, the value of currency is depreciating day by day, and price fluctuations are huge, threatening the lives of the people. The fundamental solution is to restore peace, stop military actions, massively reduce the military, and reduce military expenditure. At present, we are only starting with temporary measures, that is, the financial and monetary reform plan recently passed by the Executive Yuan, allowing free buying and selling of gold and silver, minting silver dollars, and paying military salaries in silver dollars. Customs duties are changed to collect customs gold units, the purpose is to ensure the value of tax revenue so that the government's revenue and expenditure can gradually move towards balance. Sun further admitted some past mistakes of the government, such as the fact that the foundation of local autonomy has not been established even after the establishment of the National Government for more than 20 years. Excessive centralization of power has made local politics numb. The constitution stipulates the separation of powers between the central and local governments. Regardless of how this constitution will be in the future, it should still be thoroughly implemented at present, with clear division of powers and responsibilities, and local leaders should also be elected by the people. Regarding land reform, Sun said: The Legislative Yuan formulated the Land Law during the time of President Hu Hanmin, but it has not been thoroughly implemented. The central government only implemented a part of the land tax collection. In the future, it should still be implemented according to the spirit of the law, simplifying the provisions. The Land Law was formulated based on the spirit of the Principle of People's Livelihood, not because the Chinese Communists implemented land reform and we began to imitate it.

The Executive Yuan's Move to Guangzhou for Office Work Was Approved by the Acting President.

Misunderstandings from the outside world are regrettable.

President Sun also said: Recently, there have been many misunderstandings from the outside world regarding the Executive Yuan's move to Guangzhou for office work. In fact, the government's move to the south was prepared and acted upon by military and political organs in Beijing long before I took over as head of the Executive Yuan. With the war north of the Yangtze River becoming increasingly tense, and the Communist forces' vanguard having reached a place less than 15 kilometers from Pukou, the capital felt threatened. The ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan, with the approval of Acting President Li, moved to Guangzhou for office work. The Secretariat of the Presidential Office and other Yuan and Council organs also moved away from Nanjing one after another to ensure safety. I formally notified friendly envoys on January 26 that the Executive Yuan was moving to Guangzhou for office work and requested them to move with it. Later, with the approval of Acting President Li, I went to Guangzhou with Vice President Wu on February 4. Unexpectedly, people who did not know the truth speculated a lot about this, which is very regrettable. I am very happy to be able to reunite with you here. What I deeply hope is that you will closely cooperate with the government so that the government's desire to seek peace and reform politics can be realized as soon as possible, which the vast majority of the people in the country rely on.

Immediately Responding to Ten Important Questions from Reporters

Returning to Guangzhou After Finishing Business in Beijing

Sun's explanation lasted 45 minutes before it ended. Afterwards, he immediately responded to questions raised by reporters. The important ones were: (1) Is it true that there are differences of opinion between the government and the Yuan on the peace issue, as rumored? Sun said that there were no differences of opinion. (2) Will President Sun return to stability or stay in Beijing? Sun said: Of course, I have to return to Guangzhou. Guangzhou is the seat of the government, and Nanjing is the center of peace talks, so both sides must be taken care of. Once the matters here are finished, I will return to Guangzhou. (3) During this evacuation, some ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan failed to handle matters properly, which affected the work mood of provincial and municipal government affairs and staff. Will there be any handling of this? Sun said: We will investigate the situation and study and decide separately. (4) It is said that the Executive Yuan will be partially reorganized. Has a decision been made on personnel? Sun said: It has not been decided yet, so I cannot give a specific report. (5) Will mediation by the United Nations on the Chinese Communist issue be effective? Sun said: I believe that the effectiveness of mediation by the United Nations is very small. It is better to have direct negotiations. In order to consistently seek peace, the Chinese government certainly welcomes assistance from all parties, but the United Nations is limited by the provisions of the Charter and cannot easily participate in mediating a country's domestic problems. (6) When Evatt announced the request for the United Nations to mediate, President Sun expressed welcome. Now, he says that mediation is not easy. Has the situation changed between the two times? Sun said: Mediation must be accepted by both parties to be effective. After Evatt's speech, the Chinese Communists expressed their opposition, so mediation by the United Nations will not be effective. (7) Why have the government authorities failed to implement the seven measures announced by Acting President Li? Sun said: The Executive Yuan has discussed and decided on these seven measures. One or two of them have been handed over to the Ministry of National Defense for research due to technical problems. The so-called Zhu Shi Xing Zhe is in the research of the Ministry of National Defense. (8) Is the Taiwan Provincial Government's restriction on people entering the country an order from the Executive Yuan? Sun said: The Executive Yuan has no such order. I think it is a measure by the local authorities. (9) Has President Sun heard that Minister of Industry and Commerce Liu Weizhi has engaged in corruption? Sun said: I have seen this matter reported in the newspapers, but I do not know the details. I heard that the Control Yuan is conducting an investigation. (10) What criticism does President Sun have of Qi Butong's long letter? Sun said: I have not seen this letter. This is a private misunderstanding and a legal issue.

### North Atlantic Treaty Draft Negotiations Approaching Final Stage Britain and France Support Italy's Participation in the Treaty

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Washington, 3rd Broadcasting: Norwegian Ambassador to the United States, Morgenstierne, visited Deputy Secretary of State Acheson today for 20 minutes. (2) He said, "I have not yet received instructions from the Norwegian government regarding the North Atlantic Treaty. If the government orders me to request to participate in the discussion of the treaty and can obtain a formal invitation, then Norway will participate in the discussion."

[Reuters Washington, 2nd] Secretary of State Acheson said today that the countries negotiating the North Atlantic Treaty do not have major differences. This process, which has been negotiated for six months, is now entering the final stage. Ambassadors from Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg are consulting their own countries on some new proposals. It is hoped that another meeting can be held on Thursday to complete the draft treaty. It is hoped that the full text can be published before the formal signing. Acheson also revealed that participants in the negotiations are currently discussing the possibility of other countries joining the treaty.

[Agence France-Presse London, 2nd] According to reliable sources, the British Foreign Office has received seven of the ten articles contained in the Atlantic Treaty. Experts are currently studying them closely.

[Reuters Washington, 2nd] It is learned that the negotiators of the North Atlantic Security Treaty can decide this week whether to invite Italy to participate. It is heard that Italy has expressed that if it wants to invite Italy to participate, Italy is willing to become a fundamental country of the treaty. Representatives from the countries currently participating in the negotiations here deny that they oppose Italy's participation in the treaty. Britain's attitude is that if the United States decides to invite Italy to participate, Britain will support the United States' proposal. The United States once advocated Italy's joining the treaty, but some senators strongly opposed this move. As for France, due to its close economic, geographical, and strategic ties with Italy, it advocates Italy's participation in the treaty. In addition, Norway, Denmark, Portugal, and Iceland are generally also on the list of countries to be invited to participate as soon as possible.

[United Press Copenhagen, 2nd] Well-informed sources said that Denmark may formally accept the invitation from the seven countries of the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Canada tomorrow to participate in negotiations on the North Atlantic Joint Defense Treaty.

### Rumor that the Soviet Bloc Intends to Negotiate a Military Alliance to Counter the West Under the Mutual Assistance Treaty, the Soviet Union Will Pressure Finland

[United Press Prague, 2nd] It is said that the Comintern countries in Eastern Europe are planning to formulate a military alliance to supplement political and economic ties. According to news from Poland today, the Comintern intends to convene a military conference in Hungary around the 15th of this month. Although this information has not yet been confirmed here, foreign observers do not find it surprising.

It is believed that the six countries of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia may form a military alliance to counter the North Atlantic Alliance, just as the Soviet Union announced the formation of an economic alliance a month ago to counter the Marshall Plan. Reliable sources in Warsaw reported today that the Eastern European military conference may be held in Teberlesen, Hungary, in the middle of the month, and military generals from various Eastern European countries will attend. An observer from a certain country here said that such meetings have been held several times before, but Hungarian officials denied that military generals from various Eastern European countries have held any talks within the country.

[United Press Helsinki, 3rd] According to a Social Democratic Party spokesman close to the government, it is expected that negotiations will begin next week to invite the Communist Party to join the cabinet, because if the Soviet Union invokes the Finnish-Soviet Friendship Treaty, the Fagerholm Cabinet may not be the best cabinet to negotiate with the Soviet Union. According to this treaty, the Soviet Union has the right to ask Finland for new bases when it feels that its national security is threatened. Non-Communist parties in Finland are afraid that if Norway and Denmark join the North Atlantic Treaty, the Soviet Union may take this action.

### Communist Leaders in Europe and the United States Unanimously Support the Soviet Union

[Reuters Oslo, 2nd] The Chairman of the Norwegian Communist Party, Lovlien, gave a speech here today, stating that the Norwegian Communist Party should maintain a consistent position with the Soviet Union in both peacetime and wartime, and must also be in step with the Communist parties in France, Italy, and Britain. According to reports, the leaders of the British, French, and Italian Communist parties have recently made similar remarks, expressing their support for the will of the Soviet Union under any circumstances.

[Reuters Vienna, 3rd] Following the leaders of the Communist parties in France, Britain, and Italy, the Austrian Communist Party's organ, the People's Times, published an editorial today, stating that if a war breaks out, the Austrian Communist Party will stand on the same front as the Soviet Union.

[United Press New York, 2nd] Two senior American Communist Party members declared today that if a war breaks out between the United States and the Soviet Union, they will cooperate with the democratic armies to defeat the predatory war goals of American imperialism." This statement was issued by Communist Party Chairman Foster and Secretary-General Dennis, following the recent pro-Soviet military declarations by the leaders of the French and Italian Communist parties. Dennis and ten others are accused of conspiring to advocate the overthrow of the American government by force, but Foster is temporarily exempt from trial due to a serious heart condition.

### Rumors of a U.S.-British-Egyptian Alliance The British Side Says They Know Nothing

[Reuters London, 3rd] A British Foreign Office spokesman recently denied the Cairo rumors that the United States had suggested signing a tripartite alliance with Britain and Egypt, stating that they knew nothing about this suggestion. Diplomats also believe that the report is unlikely, as the U.S. Constitution does not allow the United States to participate in foreign alliances.

### West German Constitution Draft Not Approved Returned to the Constitutional Assembly for Revision

[Reuters Frankfurt, 3rd] After studying the constitution drafted by the West German Constitutional Assembly for two days, the military commanders of the three Western occupying powers in West Germany, the American Clay, the British Robertson, and the French Koenig, jointly notified the assembly today that the draft constitution was not acceptable to the occupying authorities and severely criticized the assembly for its poor performance. The three commanders' main criticisms of the constitution are roughly divided into the following points: (1) The powers of the federal government are still vaguely defined. In order to ensure that the powers of the democratic government can be exercised smoothly after the end of the occupation, its powers still need to be more specifically defined. (2) The articles on authorizing the central parliament to promulgate civil and criminal laws still need to be revised, as the existing articles may create a highly centralized system again. (3) The central government should only have partial power to collect taxes, and local governments should share a portion of the power and participate in the decision-making of tax distribution. (4) The taxes collected by the central authorities should only be limited to maintaining the expenses of the central administrative organs. There are eight other minor revisions. This constitution, which contains a total of 139 articles, has now been returned to the West Constitution Assembly of Bonn for new revisions.

### Soviet Refugee Group Will Be Enforced to Evacuate if They Do Not Withdraw

The American Military Authorities in Germany Stated

[Reuters Berlin, 3rd] The Soviet refugee group trapped in Falkensee is still guarding its office today, refusing to withdraw from the American military zone. The deadline for the American occupation authorities to order their withdrawal is approaching and preparations are being made for enforcement. The water, electricity, gas, telephone, and food supply of the port have been cut off for 36 hours. According to authoritative sources, the American side has prepared to enter the office, escort the people inside onto trucks, and send them to the border between the American and Soviet occupation zones for entry into the Soviet zone. Soviet Commander Sokolovsky made a statement on the matter yesterday, calling Clay's action a "shameful police action," proving that the Soviet side was tearing up its goodwill.

### Southeast Asian Regional Conference to be Held in India in Early April The Commonwealth Conference Will Form an Anti-Communist Alliance

[United Press Washington, 2nd] The State Department announced on the 2nd that the Southeast Asian Regional Conference will be held in New Delhi in the first week of April so that representatives from various agencies of the Washington government and representatives from the State Department will have the opportunity to exchange views informally.

[United Press London, 2nd] The governments of the British Commonwealth are planning to take a "new approach" to the problem of Southeast Asia in order to stop the expansion of communism. A senior Commonwealth government source said on the 2nd that the main result of the New Delhi Burma Conference on the 28th was the decision to "reach an understanding with genuine nationalists." They said that the formation of this policy will be discussed at the Commonwealth Conference to be held in Ottawa or Colombo. Commonwealth government sources said that the decisions made at the planned Commonwealth Conference "will make China's transformation into communism even more important than India." They agreed that the development of events pointed to the ultimate establishment of a center for a "united government" to resist the expansion of communism in Southeast Asia. In Burma, the main effort will be to separate the Karen rebellion from communist activities. In Malaya, efforts will be made to cultivate the established Malayan Chinese Federation movement. Commonwealth government sources believe that the planned Commonwealth talks are consistent with the Western alliance and the Atlantic Treaty.

### Another Soviet Soldier Who Escaped to Japan Believes That the United States and the Soviet Union Will Conflict

He Predicts That Capitalism Will Win

[United Press Tokyo, 3rd] Soviet Army soldier Chiyanov, who escaped to Japan last autumn, told reporters here today, "The Soviet Union intends to build an airport on the Kuril Islands, only 20 miles from Japan. I don't believe that the Soviet Union already has atomic bombs, but it is said that it will have one in the future, because Molotov said so." Chiyanov said that he saw three Soviet four-engine bombers in southern Kuye Island in 1946. Chiyanov believed that a war between the United States and the Soviet Union would break out soon, initiated by the Soviet Union, but predicted that capitalism would win. The Soviet army made two moves to the Far East last year, and its internal propaganda said that the Soviet Union must always be prepared for war. Chiyanov intends to go to the United States, but the American military has not yet expressed its position.

The Karen Tribe Has Cooperated with the Communist Party

[Reuters Rangoon, 3rd] Burmese Prime Minister Thai King Nu issued a written statement today, solemnly stating that he will not consider rejoining the British Commonwealth, and even if he does join, it will not solve Burma's internal problems. The Burmese have been struggling for goose independence for a long time. Even if there is internal unrest, they are determined not to reconnect with Britain in the old relationship. Although Britain's friendly spirit will return the politics to the Burmese, Burma is grateful. Burma and the countries of the British Commonwealth will still maintain sincere friendship.

[Central News Agency Rangoon, 2nd] Burmese government officials revealed today that the war launched by the Karen tribe in the areas of Mantschule and the Delta is in cooperation with the Communist Party, but in the Pegu area, the Karen and the Communist Party have not yet reached an agreement.

### Continued Negotiations of the Four Powers on the Austrian State Treaty - U.S. Representative Proposes Suggestions - Advocates for the Protection of Slovak Rights in Austria

[Our Own Report] London, 3rd Broadcast: During today's discussion of the Austrian State Treaty by the representatives of the four foreign ministers, the U.S. representative, Lee Bo, proposed that in responding to Yugoslavia's demands, the representatives of the four foreign ministers should advocate for greater rights for the Slovak minority in Austria, namely: (1) the establishment of Slovak schools; (2) the use of the Slovak language in all official and commercial documents; (3) the freedom of association for Slovaks; and (4) equality for Slovaks in political and civil rights. The United States argues that all signatory countries should guarantee the realization of the above points. The Soviet representative, Chailupin, believes that these points are still far from meeting Yugoslavia's demands, but did not discuss the details. Today, the representatives received a lengthy memorandum from Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber, denying Yugoslavia's accusation that Austrian authorities are oppressing the Slovak people.

### Sweden Refutes Soviet Note - Accuses the Soviet Union of Interfering in Swedish Internal Affairs - Declares Absolutely No Intention to Prevent Foreign Nationals from Returning Home

[Reuters, Stockholm, 2nd] It is officially announced here that after the Soviet Union sent a note to Sweden on February 28th accusing Sweden of excluding Latvian, Estonian, and Lithuanian nationals within its borders, the Swedish government presented a reply to the Soviet Embassy here tonight, directly rejecting the Soviet accusations.

The reply stated that the Swedish Foreign Ministry was extremely surprised to receive the Soviet note accusing Sweden of using improper methods to prevent nationals of the Baltic countries from returning to their home countries. The Swedish police, like the Swedish authorities, have absolutely no intention of preventing any foreign nationals residing in Sweden from going to the Soviet Union. The note continued, stating that according to Swedish law, every individual, whether Swedish or foreign, enjoys full protection against unwarranted interference or arbitrary treatment. At the same time, Swedish legal experts believe that the Soviet Union's note to Sweden is a direct interference in Sweden's internal affairs. They also pointed out that of the 26,000 Baltic nationals in Sweden, less than one percent have returned to their home countries in the past two years. Swedish newspapers believe that the Soviet note is part of a psychological war being waged in Scandinavia.

### The Netherlands Disregards the Security Council Resolution, Showing the Extreme Seriousness of the Indonesian Issue - U.S. Representative Supports the Mediation Committee Report

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 2nd] The report of the United Nations Indonesian Mediation Committee to the Security Council regarding the situation in Indonesia concludes that the Dutch government has not complied with the Security Council's resolution passed on January 29th requesting an immediate ceasefire, the release of the Republican leaders, and the restoration of the Yogyakarta government.

The United States intends to fully support this report when the Security Council discusses it.

### U.S. B-50 Superfortress Uses Aerial Refueling - Can Bomb Any Soviet Base - "Lucky Lady II" Has Achieved Amazing Results in U.S. Air Force History

[United Press, Fort Worth, Texas, 2nd] The U.S. Air Force today completed the first non-stop round-the-world flight in history. The Boeing B-50 mid-bomber "Lucky Lady II", carrying a crew of fourteen, secretly took off eastward from Carswell Air Force Base here on the 26th. It safely returned to base today at 3:22 PM standard time (11:22 PM Shanghai time), taking 94 hours and 1 minute. The entire journey covered 23,425 miles, with an average speed of 239 miles per hour, refueling in the air four times along the way. The air force's top officials came to the airfield to warmly welcome them. The authorities believe that the test flight has yielded some important strategic lessons. According to the pilot of the aircraft, Colonel Galagher, at a press conference, this event proves that the B-50 can bomb any region in the world at any time. When asked if Air Force Strategic Commander LeMay could use the air refueling method to drop atomic bombs on various parts of the Soviet Union, Lee hesitated slightly before answering, "It's better to say that it can drop bombs wherever atomic bombs are needed." The flight route had been agreed upon in advance with the countries along the way, but carefully avoided flying over the Soviet Union. Its closest point to the Soviet Union was near Karachi, still hundreds of miles from the Soviet border. During the war, the B-29 Superfortress was used to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic bombs, but after the war, the B-50 took its place. The plane flew over the Azores, and a B-29 received a radio message and took off from Lajes Field to refuel it. The second refueling was in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, two hours and fifty-five minutes earlier than planned. The third refueling was in the Philippines, one hour and twenty-five minutes earlier than planned, and the fourth refueling was in Hawaii, fifty-eight minutes earlier. Finally, it returned to the control tower here, almost exactly as planned. According to Lee, one of the purposes of this secret flight was to test the military safety of four aerial refuelings and whether the flight could be completed without leaking secrets.

[Agence France-Presse, San Francisco, 2nd] "Lucky Lady II" used two tanker planes to refuel in the air. Using this type of tanker plane puts any Soviet base within range of American bomber formations.

[United Press, Fort Worth, Texas, 2nd] The U.S. new-style B-50 bomber "Lucky Lady II" returned to its original airfield on the 2nd. Secretary of the Air Force Symington, Air Force Chief of Staff General Vandenberg, Air Force Strategic Commander Lieutenant General LeMay, and Commander of the Eighth Air Force Division Rear Admiral Remey were all on the scene to congratulate the crew.

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] Members of Congress, in light of the B-50 bomber's feat of completing a non-stop round-the-world flight, are once again advocating for expanding the air force and strengthening national defense. Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Tydings declared that the flight has adequately demonstrated the extent to which World War III would involve all of humanity, and the air force is becoming increasingly important to the entire national defense. Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee all believe that the hope of Congress approving additional funding for the air force has been greatly enhanced.

Agreements have been reached on the principles and specific measures related to navigation. Shipping between Tianjin and Shanghai will soon be unimpeded. Representatives from the Shanghai shipping industry, such as Wei Wenhan, went to Tianjin on the 2nd to participate in the preparation for the establishment of a unified ship allocation organization and other related navigation work. The radio station also stated that the North China People's Government, in order to facilitate the movement of merchants and people and restore navigation between Tianjin and Shanghai and other places, issued "Temporary Measures for Wartime Ship Management in the North China Region" on the 1st.

### Postmaster General Visits Yan Huiqing - Inquires About North-South Postal Communication

[Our Own Report] Postmaster General Gu Chunfan visited Yan Huiqing yesterday morning to inquire about the results of negotiations on North-South postal communication. Due to Mr. Yan having many guests, the discussions were brief and he left. It is said that the Communist Party has expressed its agreement in principle to navigation and postal communication, but requires the post office and shipping industry to formally send representatives to Peiping to discuss the details of implementation. It is also said that Mr. Yan Huiqing said that although communication and navigation between Shanghai and the Communist-controlled areas of North China have now begun, they are not ideal due to various conditions and restrictions. In recent days, he has been in close contact with the ambassador and shipping leader Du Yuesheng and Postmaster General Gu Chunfan. It is generally expected that this issue will have further development soon.

### Through Train to Southern Guangdong - Can Be Realized with Accelerated Preparation

[Our Own Report] The Ministry of Communications, in order to connect transportation between South China and Central China, instructed the Shanghai-Nanjing, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureaus in January of this year to formulate a through train plan to southern Guangdong, and decided to start through train service on January 11th, scheduled to run once a week. However, due to the ordered evacuation along the Shanghai-Nanjing line and insufficient allocation of trains, this plan could not be realized. It has been learned that the Ministry of Communications has not abandoned its ideal of realizing the through train to southern Guangdong. The Railway Joint Transportation Office has recently notified the Shanghai-Nanjing, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Guangdong-Hankou Bureaus to accelerate the preparation for through train service. It is said that the bureaus are actively proceeding, and once the technical problems are resolved, the through train service to southern Guangdong can be realized.

### Mayor to Convene Meeting Today to Discuss Subsidy for Garrison Troops' Non-Staple Food

[Our Own Report] The subsidy for the non-staple food of the garrison troops in this city is far from sufficient due to the impact of rising prices on the funds allocated by the government. The local authorities have been responsible for planning. The municipal government has guaranteed the minimum amount of physical goods (i.e., one and a half pounds of firewood and one pound of vegetables per person per day), which will be planned by the Military-Civilian Cooperation Committee. According to the reporter's inquiry to the relevant authorities yesterday: a total of 300 million yuan was raised in February, all of which were apportioned by the various industry trade associations and allocated by the Military-Civilian Cooperation Committee to the various district offices. As for the total amount of the non-staple food subsidy for March, it has not yet been decided as of yesterday. It is said that it is impossible to estimate the extent of the rise in prices in advance, and once the currency system depreciates, it will be insufficient for distribution. Therefore, the authorities are preparing to formulate a more thorough method, or base it on physical objects. Mayor Wu is scheduled to convene a meeting of the Military-Civilian Cooperation Committee and representatives of various trade associations in this city in the municipal office conference room at 3:00 PM today to discuss specific measures.

### Rumor That the Municipal Government Received Evacuation Funds is Completely a Misunderstanding

[Our Own Report] Regarding the rumor that the municipal government has received a huge amount of evacuation funds, the municipal government spokesperson solemnly denied this to reporters yesterday, saying that there is absolutely no such thing and it is purely a misunderstanding. When the city was rushing to build defense works some time ago, because the funds had not been allocated by the central government, the municipal government requested the Central Bank to advance several hundred million yuan for emergency use, and used the city's special defense donation as collateral. This expense has now been returned to the municipal government by the central government, which caused outside misunderstandings and led to this rumor. The spokesperson also said: The central government did approve the allocation of funds for evacuation when the military situation is tight, but will not pre-allocate them until the enemy is at the gates, so the above rumor is too early to say.

### Customs Has Not Yet Received Order to Levy Tariffs in Customs Gold Units

Increased Import Tax Revenue in February

[Our Own Report] According to Zhang Yongnian, Director of the Jianghai Customs, when speaking to reporters yesterday, although the financial reform plan has explicit provisions for levying taxes in customs gold units, the customs has not yet received formal instructions, so implementation is still pending. Before receiving an order to change the system, everything will still be handled according to the existing regulations.

It is also learned that the import tax revenue of the Jianghai Customs totaled 1.5 billion yuan from January and February of this year. Of this, January accounted for about 500 million, and February accounted for about 1 billion yuan. The increase in tax revenue in February was due to the fact that commodity prices rose and tax revenue increased accordingly, and secondly, imports in February were slightly higher than in January.

Also, there is much misunderstanding about the settlement of gold yuan and customs gold units. According to the responsible person of the National Bank, the ratio of customs gold units to gold yuan on that day was calculated based on the closing price of the foreign exchange transfer certificate on the previous day, at a ratio of four jiao (cents) in US currency per customs gold unit.

### Council Completes Deliberation on Motor Vehicle License Tax Rate

It will begin collecting in mid-March after the Council's reply is received. In addition, the Council has completed deliberation on the license plate tax rate for motor vehicles in the 38th year and has replied to the Municipal Finance Bureau for implementation.

### Director Urges Collection of Land Value Tax - Director Inspects Various Units

[Our Own Report] Shen Zhenjia, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, in order to improve the work efficiency of the bureau's personnel and urge the accelerated collection of land value tax, inspected the various units under the bureau at 2:00 PM yesterday, accompanied by Chief of the Third Section Xie Juntao, Secretary Qian Ying, and reporters. He first went to the Huangpu District Land Value Tax Calculation Office, then to the Fahua District Land Value Tax Calculation Office, then to the Zhabei Yinxiang District Land Value Tax Calculation Office, and finally to the fifth, eighth, ninth, and third sections, and the technical office and the statistics office, the second section drawing group, in the Ziyuan Building on Sichuan Road Bridge. The inspection was completed at about 5:00 PM. All of the units were working intensely. According to Director Shen, there are a total of 170,000 plots of land in the city, and the land value tax is estimated to be 230 million yuan. In the past, it accounted for one-third of the city government's total revenue. Now, due to the continuous fluctuation of prices and the inability to adjust the land value tax at any time, the land value tax revenue has been reduced. The municipal bank sends personnel to collect the taxes at each collection office and remits them into the city treasury at any time. The Land Administration Bureau is only responsible for calculation, notification, and collection.

### Commemorative Activities for Women's Day - Preparatory Committee Resolves Three Items

### National University Presidents from Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Other Regions Return to Shanghai After Petitioning in Beijing; Solution for Adjusting Salaries and Funding Being Studied, Advance Payment for March Expenses and Food Storage Fees

[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Zhizhuo, Zhu Kezhen, Zhang Yi, Xia Jianbai, and other presidents of sixteen national universities and colleges from Shanghai, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, and other places, went to Beijing to petition on the evening of the 27th of last month regarding funding, salaries, and contingency funds. In Beijing, they met with Acting President Li, Premier Sun of the Executive Yuan, and Acting Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education, presenting various requests. Regarding the fundamental solution for adjusting salaries and funding according to the local cost of living index in the future, the Executive Yuan is currently studying it comprehensively and a decision is expected soon. In consideration of the current financial difficulties of the schools and the difficult living conditions of faculty and staff, the Executive Yuan has made an emergency allocation of 764,005,000 yuan for the March expenses of each school based on a standard of 500 times the original amount. In addition, 430,038,900 yuan has been issued to each school for three months of food storage expenses. After achieving these results, the university presidents left Beijing the night before last, and the presidents of the schools in this city arrived back here yesterday morning.

Salary Issues

The specific requests made by the university presidents to Acting Minister Chen in Beijing totaled nine items, as detailed in previous reports. Acting Minister Chen believed that it would be difficult to calculate salaries based on the current original salary without discounts, multiplied by the local cost of living index. After considering this, the university presidents agreed that the base amount could still be calculated using the existing discount method, but insisted that the multiplier must be based on the local cost of living index. The Executive Yuan immediately instructed the university presidents to prepare a rough budget. At that time, the lower-period cost of living index for Shanghai in February (643 times) had not yet been released. The sixteen university presidents estimated 500 times the original amount and prepared a budget for the additional payments due for February and the expenses for March, including student stipends, professor research funds, etc., totaling 1,528,810,000 yuan. Acting Minister Chen considered the figure too large and approved half of it, temporarily issuing 764,005,000 yuan for March expenses based on 500 times the original amount. Each school received an allocation based on its enrollment and immediately distributed salaries to faculty and staff, as well as academic research funds and student stipends, based on 500 times the original amount. In addition, the base amount for student food allowances has been increased from 4.20 yuan to 10 yuan, and academic research funds have been increased to 200 yuan for full professors, 150 yuan for associate professors, 100 yuan for lecturers, and 50 yuan for teaching assistants. The average base salary for laborers is 40 yuan, and for technicians, 60 yuan.

Contingency Funds

Regarding the contingency fund issue, the university presidents originally requested a one-time issuance of three times the new standard for each requested expense. Premier Sun proposed a compromise solution, allocating food storage fees to the sixteen schools based on a calculation of two dou of rice per person per month, totaling six dou for three months, amounting to 430,038,900 yuan. Premier Sun stipulated that this amount could only be used for collective food storage and could only be used in emergencies, and that the purchase and use of grain must be reported to the Executive Yuan.

In addition, due to the decreasing number of government-funded students and the increasing number of poor students at each school, the university presidents requested the Ministry of Education to allow each school to designate two-tenths of the total student population as work-study students. Acting Minister Chen believed that it was impossible to increase the number of government-funded students for now, but the vacant government-funded slots at schools in North China could be allocated to the schools here. If necessary, each school could handle this within the range of two-tenths of the number of self-funded students, at its own discretion.

Petitioning Schools

The schools that participated in the petition in Beijing and received funding were National Chiao Tung University, Fudan University, Tongji University, Jinan University, Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai College of Commerce, Wusong Merchant Marine College, Music College, Senior Mechanical Vocational School, Kindergarten Teacher Training College, Zhejiang University, Henan University, College of Social Education, Jiangsu Medical College, Arts College, Tangshan Institute of Technology, and sixteen other units.

### Treatment of National Army: A Soldier's Salary Table – Private's Monthly Income of 300 Gold Yuan Only Enough to Buy Fifteen Pancakes; Ministry of National Defense Planning to Improve Conditions

[Report from Our Newspaper] Under the state of preparing for war and seeking peace, many troops have been stationed in Shanghai. Not counting the troops passing through, what is the exact strength of the troops stationed in Songhu? What are the unit designations and locations? This concerns military secrets and cannot be published. However, the total strength of the entire Songhu Garrison Area is approximately 200,000 troops, stationed in the four suburbs of the city. According to a person in charge of a certain military organization, with the current troop strength, ensuring the security of Songhu is not a problem. Because there are too many troops stationed and passing through, and the barracks are limited, most are stationed in factories and schools, affecting the start of factory operations and school openings. The Garrison Command is paying close attention to this and has ordered unnecessary troops to leave Shanghai separately. Stationed troops are being moved out of factories and schools as much as possible and relocated to the suburbs, choosing ancestral halls, temples, and public places to station troops. When necessary, tents will be built in the suburbs to minimize contact with civilians and rectify military discipline. In the past, due to the large number of troops passing through, such as those passing through Shanghai to Taiwan, Zhejiang, and Fujian, as well as those retreating from Northeast and North China to Shanghai, the numbers were too large and the composition was complex. A small number of soldiers invaded civilian houses, inevitably causing disturbances to the people. After strict rectification by the Garrison Command, such phenomena are expected to decrease in the future. The biggest problem for the troops now is that the treatment is too poor and the nutrition is inadequate, which greatly affects morale. According to the reporter's investigation, the current treatment of the National Army is as follows:

Private 300 yuan

Private First Class 338 yuan

Corporal 450 yuan

Sergeant 600 yuan

Staff Sergeant 750 yuan

Sergeant First Class 1,050 yuan

Warrant Officer 4,560 yuan

Second Lieutenant 5,190 yuan

First Lieutenant 6,150 yuan

Captain 7,800 yuan

Major 9,600 yuan

Lieutenant Colonel 12,450 yuan

Colonel 14,100 yuan

Brigadier General 15,600 yuan

Major General 17,100 yuan

General 19,000 yuan

Looking at the above salary table, a private's 300 yuan per month can only buy fifteen pancakes now, and a general's 19,000 yuan is only enough to buy a dan (approx. 100 lbs) of rice. This is the treatment of the National Army! The food allowance (vegetable money) is 1,200 yuan per person per month for officers and soldiers, which is only 40 yuan per person per day. When purchasing soldiers go to the vegetable market to buy food, because the prices are too far from the market prices, they have to force vegetable vendors to buy at the so-called "official price". Vegetable vendors suffer too much loss, inevitably causing complaints. This is also one of the reasons why the military and civilians cannot cooperate. If the vegetable money in the troops is not enough, or if more vegetables are needed, it is necessary to supplement it with the staple food of military rice. According to the regulations of the Ministry of National Defense, each person's daily rice ration is 25 taels (approx. 31 oz), which is probably not finished, and the remaining rice is sold to slightly subsidize the vegetable money. The Ministry of National Defense is also very concerned about this and will improve it. It is recently heard that they are planning to distribute goods in kind, but there are still many technical problems in implementation.

Despite their best efforts, the fire was too strong and the houses were old. The fire was not brought under control until 3:45 pm. It is estimated that more than forty houses were destroyed, and the affected residents were generally displaced, which was a tragic sight. Fortunately, it was during the day, and there were no deaths or injuries.

### Public Utility Pricing in Customs Gold Units Causes Dissatisfaction Among All Sectors in the City; Passenger Traffic on Public Buses and Trams Declines, Business Slack

After the authorities approved the pricing of public utilities in Customs Gold Units, public transportation vehicles in the city began to implement it yesterday. Unit prices were posted in the vehicles, with the highest price increase reaching over 150% compared to the original fare. The price will be freely adjusted at any time according to the exchange rate in the future. This is truly a landmark miracle in public transportation ticketing. Because the fare has been changed to the Customs Gold Unit, the general public is afraid to take it, resulting in a sharp decline in passenger traffic on all public bus and tram lines in the city yesterday, and business is very slack. All sectors of the city have expressed indignation at the pricing method of public utilities in Customs Gold Units. It is also learned that the monthly and seasonal ticket prices for public buses and trams in the city sold by the Public Transportation Company are 10,000 yuan per month for ordinary public buses and 5,000 yuan for public school teachers, and 8,000 yuan per month for trams and 4,000 yuan for public school teachers, which are provisional. It was originally planned to adjust it every half month, but it was not approved by the municipal authorities. The sale price of monthly and seasonal tickets for March will not be changed.

[Another Report] Yesterday, the ticket prices for public buses and trams were officially calculated based on the Customs Gold Unit base (unit) price converted to gold yuan coupons. Tram first class is divided into 70 yuan, 100 yuan, 120 yuan, 150 yuan, and 170 yuan, five types. Third class is divided into 70 yuan, 80 yuan, 100 yuan, and 110 yuan, four types. Public buses are divided into 80 yuan, 110 yuan, 160 yuan, 180 yuan, 200 yuan, and 230 yuan, six types. Subsequently, the various ticket prices will be adjusted at any time by the Public Utility Bureau according to the fluctuation of the unit price.

### Taking a Prostitute on a Tour with Sinister Motives; Dining in a Restaurant Leads to Deception of Silver Dollars, Scalper Heavily Fooled

[Report from Our Newspaper] A prostitute named Cen Yuzhen (25 years old) from Guangdong Province in a brothel at No. 4, Love Block, Lane 135, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei District, was led in by a pimp on the evening of the 1st of this month. The client wore a black woolen Zhongshan suit and a gray tweed overcoat, was about 30 years old, and had an elegant demeanor. He was entertained by Cen Yuzhen, a Cantonese prostitute, and paid 3,500 yuan for the night. The two spent a pleasant night together. The client claimed to have just arrived from Chengdu and was unfamiliar with the area, so he strongly invited the prostitute to accompany him on a tour. Cen agreed. The next morning at 8:30 am, after getting up, they hired a car from Donghua Motor Company, driven by driver Hua Junyue, and went on a tour. They visited parks such as Zhongshan and Fuxing. Around 12:00 noon, the client asked Cen if she had any other girlfriends to join them for lunch. Cen, without thinking, ordered the driver to drive to No. 9, Lane 59, Yangjiabang, Qimei Road, to call her close friend Yang Feifei to come out and join them. The client first ordered the driver to drive to the entrance of the International Hotel, went upstairs alone, and came out more than ten minutes later. They got into the car and drove to Meilongzhen Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road for lunch. He invited the driver to sit down, ordered dishes and wine, and was in high spirits. After the meal, the waiter brought the bill, which cost 19,000 gold yuan. The client calmly claimed that he would take Cen to a nearby place to buy some small items and then return, and told Yang to wait. Yang did not suspect anything and allowed him to leave. The client took Cen by car to two jewelry stores on Nanjing Road, trying to swindle gold rings but failed. He then ordered the driver to drive to Huashan Road in western Shanghai, where he selected thirty large and small head silver dollars from silver dollar vendors, falsely claiming that he had no cash on hand. He ordered the vendors Shi Jinyuan and Sa Pinggeng to get into the car and drove straight to a certain lane entrance on Beihai Road. He ordered the car to stop and pointed to Cen, saying to Shi and others: "This is my wife, please wait a moment while I go inside to get the money." Shi and others trusted him, but after a long time they did not see him come out and realized they had been deceived. They questioned Cen, who explained that she was a prostitute and this man was a client. At this point, the driver Hua Junyue was also shocked. They quarreled with each other and went to the police station with the silver dollar vendors to report the incident. Afterwards, it was learned that Yang Feifei had waited for Cen and others for a long time at Meilongzhen, and had no choice but to pawn her coat to return home, where her husband (a postman from the Telecommunications Bureau) redeemed it with money. Yang, in her resentment, could only lament her misfortune.

### Partial Telephone Obstructions in Kubei District Being Repaired

According to the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, a 200-pair underground cable in the Zhabei District of the bureau experienced obstructions on the 12th of this month, causing telephone users in the area from Gonghexin Road east to Wuzhen Road, south to Datong Road and Guangfu Road, and west to Xiguangfu Road and Zhongshan Road to experience communication obstructions. Workers are currently being dispatched to repair it.

Afterwards, Zhang was taken to the Hudong Hospital for treatment. The local police station has dispatched personnel to investigate.

### Merchant Ship Misreported as Detained Passing Through Jiangyin; Shipping Association Requests Simplified Inspection Procedures

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the 1st of this month, twelve passenger ships of various private shipping companies that successively sailed from Shanghai to Hankou were supposed to be inspected by the fortress headquarters when passing through Jiangyin. However, because the inspection took a long time, it was mistakenly reported by various parties in the city that they had been detained. The relevant parties yesterday specifically and solemnly denied this. According to the authorities, with the importance of Jiang defense, ships traveling to and from the Yangtze River must be inspected in detail to ensure safety. As for the suspension of navigation between Shanghai and Hankou, no announcement or regulation has been heard from any party, so it proves to be absolutely inaccurate. It is learned that of the twelve passenger ships, the "Longda" and "Jiangchang" belonging to Deda and Datong Companies have already left Cheng yesterday. The remaining "Yifeng," "Anyu," "Minjiang," "Fujiang," "Fenglong," "Lixing," "Qingchang," "Zhongqiang," and two tugboats are still under inspection and will be able to depart in the next few days. The Shipping Association has submitted a request to the authorities, requesting that the inspection procedures for inland waterway ships and imported ships be simplified in the future to facilitate travel.

### Twenty Years of Ups and Downs in the Silver Screen, Selling Youth and Health; Yan Yue Sadly Talks About the Past, Drug Addiction All for Filming

[Report from Our Newspaper] The old film star "Black Rose" Yan Yuexian, who has starred in 50 films, lives with her father Yan Gongshang and her siblings after being released from prison. After a long period of quiet, she wants to dedicate herself to the silver screen again.

When the reporter visited her residence yesterday, Yan Yuexian talked about the past with a great sense of reluctance. She has been imprisoned three times for smoking opium, which is quite despised by people, who believe that she has voluntarily degenerated. However, according to her own account of the process of drug addiction, there is another sad story, which can reflect the pain of ordinary film practitioners.

She said that she started filming at the age of twelve. Because she often worked all night and the weather was unpredictable, her body deteriorated day by day. In the film "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple," she played the role of a female knight. In order to shoot the scene of flying on the roof, she wore a heavy and tight steel wire corset and jumped and ran at a high altitude, which planted the root of heart failure. In the film "Three Fathers," she co-starred with Wang Xianzai and Gong Jianong, and she played the role of the wife. In the play, Gong was executed by shooting, and she rushed over with her child, knelt in the snow, and mourned over the corpse, which froze her leg and often ached.

At that time, the lives of film practitioners were mostly corrupt. Dressing rooms were often equipped with several sets of smoking equipment, and many actors smoked opium, such as Wang Xianzai and Wang Cilong, who later died of drug addiction. Because her heart was weak and developed into asthma, she began to use opium to treat it at the persuasion of others, and slowly became addicted.

After the first imprisonment, it was followed by a second and third. She explained that it was because the asthma relapsed and she smoked again. Until now, she says that her heart is still very weak, although she no longer smokes opium.

Yan Yuexian certainly no longer has a smoker's face. She is thirty-two years old this year. Although she has gone through three prison lives, she is still very optimistic and cheerful. She said that she hopes to co-star in a film with the old stars from the past, but after more than ten years of ups and downs, this hope is probably not easy to realize.

Yan Yuexian's father, Yan Gongshang, is a veteran of the film industry and has filmed a full hundred films. He is seventy-six years old this year. Since the spring of last year, he has suffered from hemiplegia and paralysis, and the family relies on his two sons to maintain it. Although they are still doing well, they are very poor. The reporter took a photo of him, and he sighed: "What film actors sell is youth and health. This photo is probably my last one."

### The Murderer of the Corpse in a Box Must Be More Than One Person; Autopsy Finds Woman's Underpants, Police Station to Participate in the Investigation Starting Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] The railway police have been working hard on the train corpse in a box case for the past two days, and have successively discovered many valuable clues. The investigating detectives are now trying to connect the various clues to form a "hypothetical fact," and then conduct the investigation along this "hypothesis." As for the suspicious man found in Kunshan, it is only known that he was interrogated once. The railway authorities have refused to disclose anything else.

The "corpse in a box" was examined by Prosecutor Ding Tongjun of the District Prosecutor's Office at the mortuary on Changde Road at 2:00 pm yesterday. The examination revealed that there were rope marks on the skull and neck of the corpse, the skull was shattered, and there were five large and small knife marks on the upper and lower left eyes. This proves that the deceased had a fierce fight with the murderer at the time of the murder, and it is known that the murderer must not be alone. In addition to the military blanket, women's coat, newspaper, and other items published in this newspaper yesterday, a white woman's pair of underwear stained with blood was also found during the autopsy. All the evidence and the suitcase were returned to the two railway police departments for research after the autopsy. The investigating police will take the two suitcases containing the corpse parts to a certain station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway today to have the luggage handlers at the station identify them, because after the case occurred, the police department sent telegrams to each station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, informing them of the style of the two suitcases containing the corpse parts, in order to first find out the origin of the "corpse in a box". It is heard that a luggage handler at a certain station claimed that he had carried these two suitcases for passengers on the first of the month. If this point can be confirmed, it will be a big step towards solving the case.

The city police station is also paying close attention to this case. They sent personnel to participate in the work during yesterday's autopsy. The railway bureau also believes that although the case was first discovered on the train, the location of the murder and the hiding place of the murderer may not be near the station or along the railway line. The authority of the railway police is limited to the station and along the two railway lines. Therefore, starting today, the railway bureau will conduct an investigation together with the city police station.

### The Cradle of Jiangsu Soldiers: Military Cadre Class

— Our Reporter He Xianglin

[Our newspaper, Zhenjiang, 28th dispatch] Xinfeng—located southeast of Zhenjiang, 45 li from Zhenjiang, was not highly valued in people's eyes in the past. Who knew that this poor and remote Xinfeng town has become the cradle of military cadres in Jiangsu, constantly creating batches of new forces for the country.

Recently, at the invitation of Sha Yongxiang, section chief of the Second Section of the Provincial Government,

the reporter sped towards Xinfeng Town in a jeep, taking 50 minutes, and arrived at the headquarters of the Military Cadre Class of the Provincial Training Corps. From this moment on, the sound of gunfire filled my ears, and I breathed the tense atmosphere of the military camp. After Section Chief Sha introduced me to Dong Jitao, the chief captain of the class, who was from Shandong with a square face, large ears, and a plump figure, full of a kind expression, we exchanged pleasantries; then he led the deputy captain Zhou Shiyu and deputy chief captain Song Jingming to accompany the reporter to the parade ground for a visit.

First, we watched the attack of the infantry company of their second student battalion,

launching an assault formation in close combat with live ammunition, artillery fire, and machine guns firing like a string of pearls, the sound of hand grenades exploding, the performance was so realistic that it looked like a battle map, making the reporter feel an irresistible urge to abandon the pen and join the army. The entire exercise lasted for more than half an hour. Chief Captain Dong also explained that when our students studying in Japan reached the last step of the assault formation in close combat, the Japanese instructors would no longer teach us Chinese, which resulted in us suffering losses during the Sino-Japanese War.

Afterward, we continued to visit the internal affairs of the First and Second Squads of the Second Company of the school, and the First Squad of the First Company. These team sites were originally ancestral halls and temples, which, after slight renovations,

were militarized. They slept on the floor, the white sheets were folded very neatly, and the arrangement of various items was also in good order. The Fifth Company, Second and Third Squads, etc., were completely in combat readiness internal affairs, the sheets were wrapped into small rolls, and the guns were equipped with bayonets. In addition, there were educational facilities such as outdoor sand tables and literacy sand tables.

According to Deputy Captain Zhou, there are now

more than 2,000 people in this class. The first student class of more than 1,000 people started in December last year, and they will graduate in three months. There are only more than 20 days left. The second student class has already started reporting, with more than 1,000 people. The students mainly come from the platoon leaders of the security regiments of various counties and the provincial security regiment, and the exiled students who were recruited. They are all between 20 and 30 years old. The officer class has already graduated two terms, graduating in four weeks. The third term has now started reporting. Their sources are mainly officers from the security regiments of various counties and the provincial security regiment, and officers who have volunteered to join. The students are now divided into four battalions, one battalion with four companies, one company with three squads, one squad with three classes, and one class with thirteen people, totaling about 2,000 people. The officer class is divided into one battalion with three companies, totaling about 500 people.

The entire military cadre class occupies an area of four or five li, surrounded by mountains and water, which is naturally a good place to train and cultivate the mind and body. Their usual life is: get up at 6:00 in the morning, raise the flag at 6:30, do morning exercises, 7:00 go to field exercises, 9:00 breakfast, 9:30 go to the lecture hall, 2:00 in the afternoon go to exercises again, 4:00 dinner, life is very tense.

Instructor Ma Yanping told the reporter: Because the life of the team is not up to military standards and does not meet military requirements, causing people to hate it, Chairman Ding established the military cadre class, focusing on life training, to be impeccable and welcomed by the people, to achieve our goal. The training methods are divided into three types: life, discipline, and technology. Our slogans are: (1) Integration of war and teaching, the lecture hall is the training ground, and the training ground is the battlefield, (2) Consistency of learning and doing, not talking about appearances, not focusing on formality, learning and doing, cultivating a spirit of hard work and endurance, (3) Never abandon, never indulge, work hard and do practical work, such as repairing roads and planting vegetable gardens, are our active manifestations. We usually often

hold small group discussions, and the center of the discussion is life discipline, giving full freedom to express opinions. In terms of recreational activities, there are basketball, football, volleyball, and tennis. A party is also held once a week, with Peking opera, singing, comedy, juggling, etc. "Xinfeng Weekly" is the military culture of this class, which publishes articles about military life, military activities, etc. In short, we want to achieve sincere cooperation and love between the military and the people.

After three or four hours of observation, with so much material gained, the reporter felt very satisfied. If soldiers all have such a simple spirit, who says China will not be prosperous and happy? I sincerely pray that—the cradle of Jiangsu soldiers—the military cadre class—can be carried forward.

### For the Locality, for the People, for the Next Generation: Promoting the Basic Education Demonstration Zone, Jiangsu Provincial Director of Education Hong Junpei Delivers a Speech

— Our Correspondent Zhu Xianggao

[Our newspaper, Yixing, 1st dispatch] Hong Junpei, the current Director of Education of Jiangsu Province, went to Wuxi to inspect social education undertakings and resolve the problem of the principal of the provincial agricultural and forestry vocational school in this county. He came to the county on the 21st of last month, just in time for the opening of the seventh session of the first county council of this county. Therefore, on that day, he invited all the county councilors to the auditorium of the county high school and delivered a speech on "The Importance of Promoting the Basic Education Demonstration Zone in the Current Society," repeatedly reminding the councilors of their own responsibilities, leading the education staff of this county to stick to their posts and overcome the current difficult situation, emphasizing the guidance of agriculture, increasing production, assisting in promoting the development of the basic education demonstration zone, and promoting this county to embark on a bright and prosperous path of happiness. The reporter was fortunate enough to be listed in the records of the meeting, and now

the full text of the speech is recorded for reference or learning:

Regarding basic education, there are two points that must be explained first: (1) All of you present are representatives of the people. The suffering of the people depends on you gentlemen to convey to the government in order to seek improvement. Now the suffering of the people has reached its extreme. In order to solve the suffering of the people, the government must first fully understand the true situation of the people. Otherwise, talking on paper will only be scratching an itch. These are the important responsibilities on your shoulders today. The council is a bridge between the government and the people. To urge the government to relieve the suffering of the people and implement good governance, the council must first seek to cooperate with the government in order to exert its effect. Not only must the council itself be united, but it is also extremely important to cooperate with the government sincerely to exert strength, then the happiness of the people will come naturally.

(2) The situation is turbulent, and people's hearts are extremely uneasy, which often leads to social unrest. This situation is inevitable in the transitional period. Safety and danger are often in a flash of thought, leading to great mistakes. Therefore, today is truly the most difficult period. You should usually inform the people in the countryside to recognize the times, lead the people, maintain calmness, and stick to their posts, and not be shaken by external resistance, then social order can be stabilized. It is like a lonely boat in the wind and rain, and the future fate is already on the edge of misfortune and blessing. It only depends on the fellow travelers to work together with one heart and mind. The more calm, the more we can find a solution and overcome the difficulties. The more the environment and trend are treacherous, the more we must do things according to the normal track, and be calm in the face of difficulties. I believe that to stabilize social order, it is necessary to be calm, and it is especially important to

have a leader who knows how to get people to take responsibility, which lies on the shoulders of the councilors and education personnel in the local area. It is not denied that Jiangsu is the first in national education, and Yixing is the first in Jiangsu education. The culture and education of this county have always been known for their development and have a normal track to follow. However, in this extraordinary period, due to various human reasons, there are inevitably situations that deviate from the ideal. I hope that you will fully assist in order to bring it back to the right track. In other words, the harassment of the current society is the responsibility of the past education personnel. The fundamental problem is that they have completely failed in their own business. If education can be successfully carried out, there will never be a chaotic and uneasy phenomenon again. Our modern responsibility is to lay the groundwork for the next generation. The success or failure of today's education not only affects the current society, but also sows the seeds for the next generation. Therefore, I hope that you can assist education personnel in persuading the people to be calm, stabilize social order, and safely overcome the current difficulties.

I also want to ask you (2)

for two favors (1) I hope that you will advocate that the people increase agricultural production in the countryside. The biggest reason for the current social unrest is "poverty." There is a shortage of materials and society is not sufficiently distributed. If you want to increase materials, it will not be effective unless you first increase production. One of the prerequisites for stabilizing society is that, for example, Yixing has more than 1.29 million acres of cultivated land. If each acre of land can increase the yield of grain by 50 to 100 catties, it can increase production by about 600,000 dan to 1 million dan. In fact, it is not difficult to increase these numbers per acre. In addition, increasing by-products will greatly increase wealth, and the people will be greatly enriched, and society will have no reason to seek social stability. Increasing production is a fundamental problem, and it is urgent to rely on you to advocate and encourage it so that this undertaking can proceed smoothly.

(2) In the past, Chinese education followed the saying "He who excels in learning will become an official," and it became an education for cultivating a few people, not for reading for life. At this stage, education has lost its original meaning and has completely deteriorated. The slow evolution of society is because human rights cannot be equal. To seek equality of human rights, we must start with education. Equality of knowledge means that the majority of people will not be controlled by the minority. The progress of the minority cannot be called the progress of society. Basic education is not only to make people literate, but also to guide people on how to be a person, how to produce, how to live, and how to be a modern citizen. In other words, it is to instruct human beings on how to survive, and to integrate the entire education with the principles of being a person, with politics, with production, with citizenship, and with life. If basic education can be successfully promoted, we will have entered a new environment of prosperity and happiness. To promote this work, it is necessary to seek sufficient funds. At this time when the county's finances are particularly exhausted, of course, the burden on the people cannot be increased. If the importance of this work is mentioned, it cannot be called huge. Fortunately, it is taken from the locality and used for the locality. In addition, I also request the US Aid Rural Rehabilitation Committee to allocate

a part of the economy to be used for basic education, which is actually enriching local finances. If the situation does not deteriorate excessively in the future, the central government and the province will provide subsidies for the promotion of this program. The implementation of this work requires a large amount of manpower. I will recruit anyone who has some experience in basic education. I hope that you will widely recommend a vast and difficult future. I hope that you will work together to promote the basic education demonstration zone for the locality, for the people, and for the next generation, so that it can be successful. This is a task that I sincerely pray for.

### Spring Returns to Longshang

— Our Reporter Song Lin

[Our newspaper, Lanzhou, 28th aviation dispatch] The earth returns to spring, quiet and lacking vitality. However, when the reporter visited Qinghai two weeks ago, on a clear day after a fresh snowfall, I climbed the Angben Monastery, where the Tenth Panchen Lama was stationed. On the lawn in front of the monastery, I found a piece of strong reproductive vitality. The Malan grass had already sprouted thick young shoots from the muddy soil on the snow. I couldn't help but feel excited. When I drove back across the vast Kukunor grassland, a tender yellow tone was rippling from the tree branches and the tips of the grass. The spring god had quietly descended on the Northwest.

Today's Lanzhou, thanks to the activity of General Zhang Zhizhong, and the gathering and consultation of the military and political leaders of Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces, has truly become the nerve center of the Northwest. The young Mayor of Lanzhou, Sun Runan, said that it was the first time that the military and political leaders of the Northwest had gathered in Lanzhou so neatly. It is a pity that Lanzhou itself is not up to par, with frequent power outages and inconvenient water supply, and he was very sorry.

Unity, Stability, Progress, Survival

With Chief Zhang Zhizhong as the center, the dignitaries held more than a dozen symposiums and countless private exchanges of views, and finally decided on the recent future direction of the Northwest: "Seeking stability from unity, seeking progress from stability," and "Seeking survival from progress." General Zhang Zhizhong, who had been working hard for peace for several months, stole a few days of leisure, lived alone in Xinglong Mountain, more than 50 kilometers from Lanzhou, and thought deeply about the overall situation and considered the Northwest decision-making. As a result, some people inevitably held over-sensitive speculations about Zhang's actions, but now they have been shattered by the facts. Zhang repeatedly emphasized when he returned to Lanzhou: "Seeking peace requires reason and calmness." If the decision of war or peace is not yet made, and we first create chaos and make a mess, isn't that asking for our own destruction?

Overture to the Song of Spring's Return Composed

No matter how harsh the spring cold is, or how the situation changes, the authorities of the Northwest provinces have composed the "overture" for the "reason for the return of spring." Only unity, unity, and unity can smoothly unfold the work of stabilizing the Northwest. Under the subject of stability, the first answer is to save the Northwest economy, which is about to collapse. Under the leadership of the Northwest military and political officials, the Economic Commission announced its establishment on the 9th, followed by the appointment of many experts and scholars to divide into financial, financial, land, and price groups to study the current serious problems and then make thorough strengthening and improvement measures.

Rising Prices, Nostalgia for Ingots

According to the recent statistics of the municipal government, the prices in Lanzhou have risen sharply, and the monthly salary of public and education personnel is only worth one or two silver dollars. Everyone believes that, in the final analysis, the gold yuan coupons have harmed people, and they cannot help but feel nostalgic for ingots (Northwesterners call silver coins ingots). As early as half a year ago, the Gansu Provincial Government and the Provincial Council had repeatedly requested the central government to restore the Gansu Mint. Zhu Jing was approved, and after the provinces brewed and issued local currencies, the Gansu Provincial Government brought up the old matter again, and finally received approval from the central government to prepare to restore the minting of silver coins. The authorities sent people to inspect the machinery of the former mint. The main tool, the rolling machine, was missing. Whether the provincial government has decided to resume minting is subject to deep consideration based on the machine's own capabilities.

Northwest Regional Economic Unit

Before the concrete plan for reforming the Northwest economy is produced and announced, the government will implement several emergency measures to stabilize the currency value and eliminate the rising trend. According to the reporter, there are prohibitions on the export of silver coins, and the prices of gold, silver, and silver coins will be determined by the Central Bank's daily listing. As for the plan to solve the entire Northwest economic problem, it is said that a complete plan has been made for the Northwest's financial system, financial revenue and expenditure, and currency use, with the focus on forming a Northwest regional economic unit, which can not only stabilize people's livelihood, but also help production.

### Giant Prison Break Case in Changzhou: Major Criminals Fei Guoxiang and Others Apprehended

[Our newspaper, Wujin, 2nd dispatch] After the giant prison break case in Changzhou occurred, the warden Huang Weihan, the guard director Guo Lufu, and the five guards Wang Qinghui, Cao Jijing, and Wu Enze were first detained by the city defense department and sent to the police station for interrogation. It was discovered that there were many suspicious points and twists and turns, which were not convenient to publish for a while. The police station has sent the confessions of each person to the city defense department for verification, and at the same time ordered its subordinates to step up the arrest of prison breakers and the prisoners who were broken out of prison, including: Fei Guoxiang, 25 years old, from Wuxing, Zhejiang, worked in Baojialong, Shengze Town, Wujiang, with a square face and fair skin. Ni Defang, from Hutangqiao, Wujin, had committed theft. Huang Ming, 28 years old, from Tianyue, Second District, Jintan, with a small round face. Wu Jian, 30 years old, from Xipu Township, Fourth District, Danyang, with a small pointed face. Sun Xiaohai, 25 years old, from Lizhuangqiao, Danyang. Ye Caitang, 32 years old, from Cuibqiao, Henglin, a opium addict. Le Fang, 36 years old, from Guangdong. Committed the crime of treason. Chen Pinzhang, 22 years old, a opium addict. Cao Liqing, 43 years old, No. 1, Tongyi Lane, Zhongren Road, Wuxi, a repeat offender sentenced to three years and six months, with nearsightedness. Also, Cao Liqing had compiled a bail application, which was sent to the district court by someone one day after the incident. The clerk Feng of the court's dispatch department received it as usual, and was later severely reprimanded by President Zhang. There is also an episode about Cao Xianqing, who and Jiang Shixiao both committed tax evasion and corruption. Currently, Jiang Shixiao is still in custody. Zeng Yu came out and jointly contributed to the public appeal column of the Wuxian Subao, the voice of the people. The original text roughly stated that Yang Anren, the protagonist of the Jin Chao case, and Zhang Hongtu, the protagonist of the corruption in the two-way bureau, etc., had been freed, and the small corruption officials were still in the cage. Please ask the authorities to follow the example and approve bail. The readers felt both funny and absurd.

### Impression of Minggang

— Our Special Correspondent Fang Canglang

After a discussion, the reporter group decided to get off the train to visit. Unexpectedly, after the train stopped, the sound of firecrackers on the platform was deafening. In the line of people from all walks of life welcoming them, there were many elders with white hair and beards. Mr. Li Jiexiang, an old man of 71 years old in the town, also stood respectfully in the line, smiling to greet them. Such a scene and such a sight made all the colleagues feel extremely ashamed. However, because of the warm invitation, they could not bypass the platform and escape. They had to cup their fists, salute, bow, and wave their hands to return the salute while walking quickly. After entering Minggang Village, the sound of firecrackers on the street was rising and falling one after another, resounding throughout the village. When they arrived at a certain military division headquarters, they met the local elders. They asked for advice one by one and thanked and apologized repeatedly. Then the reporter and his colleagues could not help but smile embarrassedly at each other.

We had dinner with the local elders in the division headquarters. After dinner, we held a symposium and listened to some touching stories of military-civilian cooperation, and listened to some valuable opinions from the elders. They talked about the activities of the local communists in Tianmu Mountain, east of Minggang, and the local communists in Tongbai Mountain on the railway

[Our newspaper, Xinyang, 26th aviation dispatch] The importance of the defense of Zhumadian is as mentioned above. In order to reduce the hard work of the garrison in receiving and protecting us, the reporter group said goodbye to all circles at 3:30 pm on the same day and returned to Xinyang in the original car. At 4:50, the car passed Minggang. Because the military had already called in the morning, it was learned that the elders of Minggang were eager to give the threat to the west, but very trusted in the military power of General Li Benyi to stabilize the surrounding areas, and praised the military discipline of Li's military division. Minggang belongs to Xinyang, about 90 li from the town, and about 85 li from Zhengyang in the east. The entire town has a population of more than 20,000, and its main products are grain, pigs, soybean oil, sorghum wine, and cow and sheep skins. The folk customs are very simple. On the first day after the Lunar New Year, Ma Lou and other places in the fifth pao of the town had conflicts with the local team from Biyang, which came south from the north, due to misunderstandings between the military and the people. More than a dozen villages were burned down, and more than 30 villagers were killed.

After the incident, according to the official, these teams without clothes and food were indeed pitiful and terrible. They are now starting to rectify them, but the villagers in Minggang who were victimized are already dead and cannot be resurrected. We hope that the authorities will quickly eliminate these bad teams and stop harming people. When we left Minggang, everyone was filled with a sense of guilt and said goodbye to the elders and all circles in the town, and returned to Xinyang at 9 pm that night.

### Southwest Transportation Artery: Reviving the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Project

— Our Reporter Zhou Xueduan

[Chengdu Report from Our Newspaper, 26th] Amidst the raging war and forced endurance of the New Year, the people of Sichuan and Chongqing recently received an unexpected piece of encouraging news: the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, a major artery of transportation in the Southwest, has been revived by order of the central government. Funding has been included in the national budget, and the construction of the light rail section within Chongqing is being expedited, with a deadline for completion within the year. As the only railway serving as the backbone of Sichuan's transportation, it has been plagued for nearly forty years, with ups and downs, frequent stops and starts in construction. Today, there is optimism about its eventual completion, with a bright future in sight, which brings immense warmth and comfort to the people of Sichuan who have endured a decade of war.

Full Project Filled with Hardship

The history of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project represents the vicissitudes of forty years of Sichuan's prosperity and decline. Before the change of government, when the railway was first proposed, more than 27 million yuan was raised. When nationalization was proposed, the people of Sichuan shed blood and risked their lives to protect their transportation sovereignty, which led to the Xinhai Revolution. Since the founding of the Republic, warlords fought for power, with over 380 large and small civil wars, and the railway funds were completely divided up, causing the entire project to come to a standstill. In the 27th year of the Republic [1938], when Sichuan's situation had somewhat stabilized, the central government initiated a construction plan and signed a contract with a French banking group to form the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company to manage the project. However, shortly after construction began, the War of Resistance broke out, and materials could not be transported inland, causing the project to suffer another setback. After the victory and restoration, the National Government, to reward Sichuan for its special contributions during the War of Resistance, instructed the Ministry to revise the plan to complete the entire railway within two years. However, due to the depleted national treasury and insufficient funding, the construction work was intermittent. This only railway, the transportation heart of the Land of Abundance, has faced twists and turns and numerous hardships from its initial proposal to its construction, spanning forty years. This time, the central government's early implementation of the three-year completion plan for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project will undoubtedly usher in a new era for transportation in the Southwest.

Expedited Construction with a Deadline

According to the plan for expedited construction with funds allocated by the Executive Yuan, the following four points have been approved by the Yuan's meeting: (1) 10.06 million gold yuan has been allocated as an advance for the second half of the 37th year [1948]. (2) 30 million gold yuan for transportation and miscellaneous expenses will be allocated as planned. (3) An initial three months' worth of construction funds at 20 million gold yuan per month will be allocated first. (4) The Central Bank will allocate at least one million US dollars out of the four million US dollars in foreign exchange needed for the first year's plan. According to the Ministry of Transportation's plan, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway will serve as a major trunk line connecting the Northwest and Southwest railways. Currently, the roadbed of the 283-kilometer section from Chongqing to Neijiang is mostly completed and is almost ready for track laying. To facilitate early traffic, light rails that can be manufactured by Chongqing's steel mills and materials that can be supplied by Sichuan Province will be used for temporary operation on the Chongqing section. At the same time, foreign materials will be actively procured, and upon arrival, they will be replaced gradually. The dismantled light rails will be moved forward step by step and eventually used to lay branch lines along the entire route. In the early stages of this light railway's operation, the daily transportation volume can reach 800 tons, greatly alleviating the current transportation difficulties in Sichuan Province. This is undoubtedly good news for the people of Sichuan, who have been suffering from prolonged warfare, and will promote peaceful construction.

One-Year Light Rail Plan for Chongqing Section

The one-year plan for the Chongqing section light rail construction, which has already commenced, includes: (1) Temporarily modifying the route to lay light rails, with a length of 283 kilometers from Chongqing to Neijiang. (2) The route standard, including the roadbed, bridges, culverts, and tunnels, will still be constructed according to the national railway gauge standard. Steel rails will initially be laid using 30-pound light rails for operation. Once foreign heavy rails arrive, they will be replaced immediately, and the removed light rails will be used to lay branch lines. (3) Locomotives, vehicles, and machinery will be allocated from various railways as much as possible, using light locomotives and self-made passenger cars. Steel materials that cannot be supplied domestically will be purchased from abroad as soon as possible. (4) The cost of labor and materials is estimated at 196 million gold yuan, based on January prices, including: 1. Completing the unfinished projects on the Chongqing section; 2. Laying tracks, building bridges, and manufacturing passenger and freight cars; 3. 500,000 sleepers; 4. 10,000 tons of 30-pound light rails; 5. 800 tons of steel bridges; 6. 300 tons of cargo from Shanghai to Chongqing, etc. With the implementation of this plan, Sichuan's first formal railway is expected to be open to traffic within a year, and the 40-year dream of the people of Sichuan will be realized.

Coordinating Engineering and Economic Development

To coordinate with the one-year opening to traffic, the Sichuan Provincial Government is also planning to expand economic construction. Along the entire Chengdu-Chongqing Railway line, it is actively mobilizing local resources to expedite the construction of branch lines or highways to connect with the main line. For the branch line portion, such as the Chengdu-Leshan, Chengdu-Pengxian, Jing (Zigong)-Nei (Jiang) lines, local people have separately formed companies, raised funds, and started construction. For the highway portion, such as the Zi (Zhong)-Wei (Yuan), Nei (Jiang)-An (Yue) lines, construction has also begun. The aim is to ensure that within a year, Sichuan's special products, such as the sugar from Zizhong and Neijiang, the salt from Zigong, and the coal from Weiyuan, can be transported smoothly through this major transportation artery. According to the transportation plan after the entire line is completed, it is estimated that 1.5 million tons of goods will be transported annually, including 500,000 tons each of rice and coal, and 100,000 tons each of salt, sugar, tung oil, bristles, medicinal materials, hardware, cloth, general merchandise, and other miscellaneous goods. The Provincial Government has also formulated a plan to develop special products to meet the transportation needs, as the central focus of Sichuan's construction plan for this year. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project, which is starting a new revival this year, is not only good news for transportation in Sichuan Province but can also be said to have become the driving force for the entire economic construction of Sichuan.

### Jiangsu Province's Universal Training Reaches Over 5 Million People

[Zhenjiang Report from Our Newspaper, 2nd] According to the Jiangsu Provincial Security Command, the work of organizing and training the people in various counties has been universally implemented. This work is based on the "Regulations for Strengthening the Organization and Training of the People in Jiangsu Province," which was formulated with reference to the training regulations promulgated by the Executive Yuan and in accordance with the actual situation of Jiangsu Province. It was approved by the 198th meeting of the Provincial Government and issued to various counties for implementation. All people below the Bao level are included in the organization, organized into Bao Zhuang Teams, Youth Teams, Children's Teams, Respect for the Elderly Associations, Women's Associations, etc., and given training for self-defense and self-government. To strengthen the leadership of grassroots cadres, the Provincial Government recently decided to make Bao Chiefs and Bao Team Leaders salaried positions, paid at the 16th level of delegated positions. According to reports from various counties, the number of people undergoing training has reached over 5 million.

### Embracing Qian Politics Reform with a Serious and Complex Mood: Diligent Implementation Makes Self-Reliance Not Difficult

— Our Reporter Liu Mengchi

[Guiyang Report from Our Newspaper, 25th] Guizhou has always followed the central government politically and relied on neighboring provinces economically, resulting in various physical and psychological weaknesses. This did not matter during times of national peace, but now that the flames of war are gradually burning closer, it can no longer remain weak and must strive to support itself and find ways to be self-reliant to survive these difficult years.

In December of last year, the Guizhou Provincial Government formulated a plan to adjust the structures of county-level organizations. Not only has this been effective in the province's counties, but neighboring provinces such as Sichuan, Hunan, and Guangxi have also requested copies of the plan to use as a blueprint for reforming grassroots politics, indicating that administrative structures are not immutable and must be adapted to changing circumstances. Ninety-five percent of the province's expenses rely on central government subsidies. Currently, the national treasury is more depleted than ever before, and transportation between Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Guiyang is more difficult than in any neighboring provincial capital. While comprehensive peace is desired by everyone, if the war continues and everything changes, Guizhou, being a remote and impoverished province, must prepare early. Based on this need, Chairman Gu Zheng-lun instructed the relevant departments to draft a "Guizhou Provincial Political Reform Plan," which, after more than a month and several revisions, was formally approved at today's (25th) Provincial Government Standing Committee meeting and ordered for immediate implementation. This plan aims to

raise the authority of Commissioners and County Magistrates in terms of regulations. The Provincial organs and schools stationed in the counties are authorized to supervise and assess on behalf of the Provincial Government. The chiefs of the Land and Food Administration, Tax Collection Administration, Police Bureau, and Deputy Commander of the People's Defense Corps in each county may be nominated and guaranteed by the County Magistrate. If the heads of various departments in the county government commit serious misconduct, whether they are appointed by the Provincial Government or nominated by the County Magistrate, the County Magistrate is allowed to suspend them first and nominate someone to act as their replacement. To reserve candidates for County Magistrates, it is stipulated that current administrative staff in the county government with outstanding performance may be considered one of the standards for appointing County Magistrates. County Magistrates and heads of various departments are allowed to receive special office expenses, with County Magistrates receiving the same as Provincial Government committee members and heads of departments receiving the same as Provincial Government section chiefs. They will be adjusted along with Provincial-level personnel and will not receive separate allowances for integrity or integrity grain, in order to save local finances.

In terms of laws and regulations, the plan strives for simplification and ease of implementation. It is stipulated that all laws and regulations should be flexible. If they do not conform to the actual situation in the respective counties, the counties are allowed to draft alternative methods and submit them for approval and implementation. If central government laws and regulations are outdated or do not conform to the actual situation in the province, they must be submitted for repeal or amendment. Provincial single-line regulations must be thoroughly reviewed and repealed or merged to achieve clarity. To strengthen

contingency measures, provincial-level organs will implement the principle of joint offices. All matters relating to general affairs, accounting, statistics, personnel, inspection, and supervision will be handled uniformly to reduce expenses and increase efficiency. County-level organs will follow the previously issued "County-Level Organization Adjustment Plan" and will not be allowed to change it rashly. Coordinating with this organizational adjustment, the

personnel decisions are as follows: In the provincial-level part, after the joint office, the total number of provincial government staff (excluding schools) will be retained at two-thirds, and the rest will be dispatched to work in districts and counties to avoid the over-concentration of talent. Staff sent to districts and counties will retain their original salaries and levels. However, those who are unwilling to go will be considered to have resigned. In the county-level part, county government staff must be strictly screened, and those who are incompetent will be dismissed. Vacancies will be filled by staff dispatched from the provincial level. Township and town chiefs will be temporarily suspended from popular election and will be appointed by the county magistrate from qualified candidates. Township and town chief officers and Bao officers will begin training immediately and will be firmly controlled and utilized by the county magistrate. Finance is the

mother of all government affairs. The following regulations apply to provincial-level finances: To achieve the goal of wealth and poverty alleviation, self-defense special taxes should be heavily levied, and excessive profits from commercial and speculative activities may be targeted at wealthy households for special relief taxes when necessary. To ensure fair burden, land survey and equal taxation will be one of the main central tasks this year. Regarding county-level finances, the plan emphasizes the effective consolidation of existing tax revenues, strictly prohibiting local government employees, educators, and senators from contracting to collect taxes, raising the standards for penalties for late payments, and piloting township and town tax collection. The plan also calls for strict implementation of ad valorem taxation, adjusting it at any time to increase tax revenue, and using in-kind collections whenever necessary. Counties may add 10% interest grain to accumulated grain loans to cover storage expenses. The use of apportionment to generate production in townships and towns must be strictly prohibited. Due to the shortage of auxiliary currency in various counties, efforts should be made to negotiate with the Central Bank for transportation. If miscellaneous auxiliary currency or substitutes are issued on their own, their circulation should be strictly prohibited when the Central Bank's auxiliary currency arrives.

The primary central task for Guizhou Province this year is public security. County magistrates' performance in organizing and training the People's Defense Corps will be the basis for their evaluation and retention. The Deputy Commander of the People's Defense Corps should avoid being from the same locality. All general team attachments will be abolished and replaced with training supervisors who will be sent to various townships and towns to oversee training. Training will be conducted using a mobile training approach. People who have already undergone organization and training should be given economic assistance, such as providing salt based on population, prioritizing agricultural loans, and distributing American tobacco seeds. The ideal equipment is "everyone on the roster must have a gun, and everyone with a gun must have ammunition." The main and side food allowances for team members must be merged into the soldier's mess allowance and issued in rice, with the minimum amount sufficient for a soldier's necessary food.

Guizhou's economic development policy emphasizes both agriculture and industry, with agriculture focusing on increasing land production and industry focusing on developing land transportation. Therefore, the focus this year remains on "transportation first" and "production first." To compensate for the leakage of salt and cloth, the province will continue to promote American tobacco, rapeseed, tung oil, and wood oil, but technical guidance should be strengthened to avoid fruitless efforts. The province will reward people for planting trees on public barren mountains. After the trees mature, they will belong to the people, and the public land will also belong to them as a reward. Burning mountains will be strictly prohibited to protect the forests. The construction of county roads should be uniformly designed and technically guided by the Construction Department, and counties should not act independently to avoid repeating the past mistakes of wasting manpower and resources on impractical projects.

Other aspects, such as the strict implementation of the ban on opium, the effort to popularize health, and the determination to reform social customs, are discussed in detail. The general standard is to ensure that all public employees

practice honesty and competence. "Honesty" means that officials are not corrupt, clerks do not harass, and soldiers and police do not act like local bullies. "Competence" means breaking the negative mentality of "seeking no merit but avoiding mistakes."

More than 5,000 people in Guizhou and current employees of the provincial government are facing this new reform plan with serious and complex emotions. If it is diligently implemented, then 11 million people in Guizhou should be able to provide for themselves and the whole territory should be blessed. However, the degree of success will still depend on the extent to which it is implemented.

### Sanbei Ship Shot at, Child Killed by Stray Bullet

[Zhenjiang Report from Our Newspaper, 2nd] The "Sanbei" ship of the Shanghai Sanbei Company departed from Shanghai on February 28th. At noon, when it arrived near Si Dunzi on the north bank of the Yangtze River in Jiangyin, it was suddenly strafed by Communist machine guns. The bullets were as dense as rain. The ship's child, Le Gen (28 years old, from Ningbo), was killed instantly by a stray bullet. There were no other losses. The ship safely arrived in Zhenjiang on the 1st.

### Implementation Plan for Land Reform in Jiangxi Province

— Our Reporter Liu Zao

[Nanchang Report from Our Newspaper, 26th] "Land to the tiller" is a consistent policy of the Kuomintang's implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood and is also one of the central tasks of the Jiangxi Provincial Government this year. Upon taking office, Chairman Fang Tianyi declared that he attached great importance to the issue of land reform and hoped to achieve practical results through rapid methods.

The Provincial Government, with reference to the successful examples of land reform in Guangxi and Zhejiang, has drafted the "Implementation Plan for Land Reform in Jiangxi Province," which will be promulgated and implemented soon. According to Mr. Liu Jiashu, the director of the Provincial Government Information Office, the contents of this plan are divided into four points:

(1) Limiting Private Cultivated Land: It stipulates that the private cultivated land of each household of ten people shall not exceed 50 mu of superior paddy field, 70 mu of medium paddy field, or 100 mu of inferior paddy field. Dry land is doubled in comparison. The cultivated land exceeding this limit shall be sold within six months. If it is not sold after the deadline, it will be requisitioned by the county (city) government and distributed to the original tenant farmers or owner-cultivators. The selling price of the land shall be 70% of the original rent, and the payment shall be made in kind over 14 years starting from the 39th year [1950]. Barren land, ownerless cultivated land, or surplus cultivated land, except for those purchased by the original cultivating farmers, shall be given priority to be purchased by the families of active servicemen. This is the center of the two major policies of "land to the tiller" and "land to the soldiers." The land directly distributed to owner-cultivators by the government shall be priced at five times the original rent and repaid over ten years. Other standards regarding the grading of cultivated land and rent are also specified in detail in the plan.

(2) Supporting Owner-Cultivators: (1) Requisitioning and distributing private cultivated land; (2) Prohibiting non-owner-cultivators from purchasing cultivated land; (3) Providing loans for owner-cultivators; (4) Establishing owner-cultivator farms.

(3) Protecting Tenant Farmers: (1) Registering leases; (2) Limiting rent; (3) Protecting tenancy rights. When landlords take back the land for self-cultivation, they shall notify the tenant farmers one year in advance. When tenant farmers request to withdraw from cultivation, they shall notify the landlord three months in advance.

(4) Strengthening Farmers' Organizations: (1) Farmers' associations at all levels shall complete their organization within two months and assist in handling land reform. (2) Owner-cultivators are absolutely prohibited from participating in farmers' associations as members to prevent the intrusion of local bullies and gentry. If this regulation is violated, the responsible government official in charge shall be severely punished.

The land reform plan drafted by the Provincial Government is not only a plan but also has specific deadlines for implementation and completion. According to the regulations, the following will be carried out: (1) Total registration or general investigation of cultivated land will begin in April of the 38th year [1949] and be completed in October. Surplus cultivated land shall be sold before January of the 39th year [1950]. (2) The work of requisitioning cultivated land and supporting owner-cultivators will begin in March of the 39th year [1950] and be completed in December of the same year. (3) Lease registration shall be completed before February of the 39th year [1950]. (4) The demonstration period for owner-cultivator farms shall be completed within two years.

Chairman Fang has the greatest determination to thoroughly implement Jiangxi's "Land Reform Plan" and is prepared to use the spirit of fighting the enemy to remove obstacles such as local tyrants and bullies encountered in the process of promoting this new policy to complete this major epoch-making reform in history and economy.

### Preparations for Establishing a Public Gold and Silver Market: The National Bank is Still Studying the Matter; One Theory is That it Will Adopt a Government-Supervised, Privately-Operated Model

[Our Newspaper's Report] External sources have repeatedly reported that the National Bank authorities, to cooperate with the financial and monetary reform plan, are planning to open a gold and silver market so that the National Bank can, through legitimate channels, observe the market conditions at any time and sell gold and silver to achieve the goal of stabilizing the financial market. However, based on various (two) indications, the National Bank authorities are currently still in the stage of researching and planning this project. As for the organization of a specialized committee to be responsible for selling gold and silver, it is clearly not yet mature. The National Bank authorities are also remaining silent on this matter. However, judging from the fact that the bank's President Liu has repeatedly invited Xu Fusun, a leader in the gold industry, and Wu Pengnian, chairman of the Silversmiths' Association, for discussions, it is clear that the authorities are actively promoting this matter.

Furthermore, according to Xu Fusun and Wu Pengnian, this time they were invited by the financial authorities purely for consultation purposes. They have no preconceived notions about the authorities' plans to open a gold and silver market, as the decision-making is purely the government's plan, and the authorities only inquired about the number of members in the gold industry and silversmithing industries, their business methods, buying and selling habits, and the standards for the quality of goods. In addition, they were not asked to contribute any opinions on the future gold and silver market.

(Another Report) After the announcement of the new financial and monetary plan, the free trading of gold and silver has been restored. To ensure that gold and silver transactions are on the right track, the authorities are promoting the establishment of a public gold and silver market by gold and silver merchants. Liu Gongyun, president of the National Bank, has repeatedly summoned the persons in charge of the former Gold Industry Association and the Silversmiths' Association to discuss the steps for establishing a public gold and silver market. The new market will operate under a government-supervised, privately-operated model and will engage in transactions. The control measures are currently being drafted by the Ministry of Finance and will be announced soon. The new market is expected to be established before mid-month.

The public gold and silver market has been suspended for several years, and the authorities' sudden decision to plan for its restoration has attracted much attention from all parties. It is widely believed that the authorities' aim is to divert idle funds and reduce the pressure on prices.

### Technical Authorities Consider Improving the Foreign Exchange Purchase Method: May Change to Foreign Currency Deposits; Deposit Certificates Allowed for Free Trading

Regarding the foreign exchange purchase work, since the Central Bank began posting purchase prices a few days ago based on the financial and monetary reform plan, the purchase work has not been able to proceed smoothly due to the discrepancy between the posted prices and the actual prices. A reporter recently learned from financial authorities that the authorities are considering making technical improvements to this purchase method. However, the purchase principle will not be changed. According to sources at the Central Bank, the technical change may involve changing the current cash purchase to a foreign currency deposit. After handing over the foreign currency to the Central Bank, the bank will issue a deposit certificate similar to a foreign exchange transfer certificate. This deposit certificate will be allowed to be freely traded and used to offset import foreign exchange.

### Trade Association Requests Purchase of Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates from Wuzhou Merchants

It is reported that although Wuzhou has been approved by the Executive Yuan as a foreign trade port, the local National Bank still refuses to purchase foreign exchange transfer certificates held by Wuzhou exporters. The Guangzhou National Bank is also limited to purchasing transfer certificates issued in Guangzhou, leaving Wuzhou exporters with nowhere to sell their transfer certificates. In terms of capital deployment, they are experiencing the pain of suffocation. The International Trade Association here has reported the situation and has transferred the request to the National Bank to order its Wuzhou branch to purchase transfer certificates, and has also telegraphed the Shanghai and Guangzhou branches to purchase them on their behalf. At the same time, it has been decided that the amount obtained from the sale of Wuzhou certificates in Shanghai will be allowed to be remitted to Wuzhou free of charge.

### Ministry of Finance Instructs Procedures for Depositing Cash for Capital Increase by Banks and庄s in Various Regions

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding those banks and庄s in various regions that have deposited cash for capital increase, the Ministry of Finance recently notified the National Bank that it can first send personnel to inspect and report to the ministry according to the prescribed procedures. The Ministry of Finance's telegram is as follows: "Upon investigation, for those banks and庄s in various regions that have deposited cash for capital increase in accordance with the regulations, your bank or the bank entrusted with the verification of capital should immediately send personnel to the relevant banks and庄s to check the accounts and verify that the vouchers and stock subscription stubs prove that the increased capital and the revalued assets are genuine. After issuing a guarantee in accordance with the prescribed format, issue a certificate of capital verification and forward the adjustment of capital report submitted by each bank and庄, along with the signatures of the responsible persons and the asset-liability statement, to this ministry for verification, in order to expedite the process. Furthermore, trust companies are a type of bank, and all trust companies that have been approved by this ministry to establish should adjust their capital and deposit cash for capital increase in accordance with the regulations."

### Balance of National Banks

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the balance of national banks showed an outflow of 65,334,000 yuan. Foreign banks showed an inflow of 87,563,000 yuan. Banks in the large clearing house showed an inflow of 25,730,000 yuan, while banks in the small clearing house showed an outflow of 36,032,000 yuan.

### The Gold Control Bureau Decides to Strictly Crack Down On Pricing of Goods in Silver Dollars; Although Silver Dollars are Allowed to Circulate, They are Not Unlimited Legal Tender

[Our Newspaper's Report] It is reported that since the financial and monetary reform plan was announced, a small number of stores in this city have been pricing their goods in silver dollars. A responsible person from the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau told reporters that the government's permission for silver dollars to circulate was originally a measure to stabilize the financial system and facilitate the people, and it does not mean that silver dollars will replace gold yuan as currency. In other words, the gold yuan is still the standard currency with unlimited legal tender status. Although silver dollars can circulate freely, neither creditors nor debtors can force the other party to use them as a means of payment. Therefore, all transactions are still legally made using gold yuan. Merchants pricing in silver dollars not only have the suspicion of forcing customers to use silver dollars as a means of payment, but also hinder the currency system and disrupt the financial system, and should be strictly cracked down on.

### No Profit in Smuggling During Price Fluctuations

Smuggling Cases at Customs Decrease Significantly

According to news from the Jianghai Customs, smuggling cases in this city have decreased significantly recently, and the quantity has also decreased. Because smugglers have no profit to be made when prices fluctuate greatly, they have stopped their activities. Currently, those seized by customs are mostly single peddlers from Hong Kong to Shanghai, carrying a small number of luxury goods such as nylon stockings and lipstick in their luggage. There are no large-scale smuggled goods.

### Paid-for Goods Licenses: 1,574 Issued

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the Export-Import Control Commission, the value of import goods for which paid-for goods licenses were issued during the week of the 19th to the 26th of last month reached US$6,588,511.84. There were a total of 22 types of goods, and 132 licenses were issued. The value of imported goods was greatest for wool tops, totaling US$1,492,40.56. Second was cigarette paper, totaling US$97,795.31. Third was machinery and parts, totaling US$73,696.84. Pharmaceuticals and medical supplies ranked fourth, totaling US$73,321.12. The most licenses issued were for dyes, totaling 30.

According to statistics, during the 17 weeks from November 1 of last year to February 26 of this year, the association issued a total of 1,574 import licenses for paid-for goods, with a total value of US$11,428,143.18.

### Customs Revenue for Last Month: Totaled 1 Billion Gold Yuan

Currently, Taxes are Not Yet Assessed in Customs Gold Units

According to Zhang Yongnian, the Jianghai Customs Commissioner, the recent customs revenue has been increasing daily. The total amount of customs duty revenue for last (two) month was 1 billion gold yuan, an increase of 400 million yuan compared to January. The reasons for the increase in tax revenue are (1) the exchange rate of foreign exchange transfer certificates has been increasing from time to time, (2) there has been a slight increase in import and export trade recently.

According to Zhang, in the financial and monetary reform plan, it is stipulated that customs duties will be calculated in customs gold units. The customs has not yet received an order from the Ministry of Finance to implement this. To date, the customs is still collecting customs duties according to the old methods.

### Tea Market Transactions Not Numerous

Since the continuous surge in tea prices, the market yesterday did not rest, but intensified. The main reason is that the supply of both black and green tea is scarce. At the same time, the surge in financial assets, non-market commodities, and public utilities has had a significant impact on costs, thus becoming the main factor driving up prices. By the close of the market, the prices of all grades were rising, but in terms of transactions, although negotiations were heated, the prices offered by both sides were far apart, and only a few deals were concluded.

### The Chinese Stock Market Turned Weak; Taiwan Sugar Saw New Prices Again

Yesterday, Chinese stocks stopped rising across the board and turned to decline. The market started strong but ended weak, falling all the way down. The main reasons are that the previous gains were too rapid, credit was still tight, and large institutional investors turned from long to short, stopping their advances and retreating. Yong Yarn initially opened high at 4.30 yuan, and after the opening, the price fluctuated around 2 jiao. At around 11 o'clock, it once rose as high as 4.25 yuan, and the price seemed to be rebounding. But at 11:15, news spread that the Central Bank was selling a large amount of exchange settlement certificates, and sentiment softened again, and the market fell again. The lowest price was below 4 yuan, at 3.93 yuan. Near the close, off-market gold was said to be doing well, and the price was raised to close at 4 yuan. Meiya fell, opening at 1.85 yuan, with a high of 1.87 yuan, a low of 1.68 yuan, and closing at 1.71 yuan. Hetang saw new prices again, trading at 28,520 yuan, its tenth time going up. Among the small-cap stocks, only four hit their daily limit: Xinya Pharmaceutical at 1.24 yuan, Zhenhua Paint at 1.74 yuan, Hengfeng Yarn at 1.03 yuan, and Huaxin Cement at 3 jiao.

### Foreign Stocks Still in Demand

The foreign stock market is still trending steadily. Credit within the market is not as tight as outside, only around 6 jiao, so yesterday's prices were still high. However, trading was light. Wheelock Marden was very strong, trading as high as 23,000 yuan, an increase of 1,000 yuan from the previous day. Jardine Matheson traded at 7,700 yuan and 8,000 yuan, also slightly higher than the previous day. Shanghai Dockyards saw a slightly lower increase, only about 50 yuan higher than the previous day. Other stocks varied, with both gains and losses.

### Gold Bonds to be Listed This Morning

Short-term gold bonds will begin trading on the market today. The stock exchange has issued a public announcement, setting the opening auction for this morning. The auction period is from 9:30 am to 12:30 pm and from 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm every day. The market is closed on Saturday afternoons. The trading period is divided into spot and one-day futures. The transaction unit is tentatively set at one tael of gold face value. The asking price is the amount of gold yuan per tael of gold. The price increase/decrease unit is tentatively set at 50 yuan, and the daily limit is tentatively set at 10%. The margin for one-day trading is 40%, payable in cash.

### Hong Kong Exchange Rate Shrinks Again

[Commodities Research Institute, Hong Kong, 3rd Telegram] Hong Kong-Shanghai telegraphic transfer opened this morning at 1.30 yuan per thousand yuan. The closing rate last night was 1.42 yuan. Gold yuan opened this morning at 2.60 yuan per thousand yuan, the same as the closing price yesterday. Hong Kong gold (per Hong Kong tael) opened this morning at 304.75 yuan, the closing price yesterday was 305.50 yuan. US dollar telegraphic transfer opened this morning at 5.10 yuan, the closing price yesterday was 5.19 yuan. US dollar forward opened this morning at 5.17 yuan, the closing price yesterday was 5.16 yuan. US dollar banknotes opened this morning at 5.15 yuan, the same as the closing price yesterday.

### Tung Oil Advances

Yesterday's tung oil market surged because goods from Hankou had not yet arrived, prices of goods outside the industry were soaring, and credit in the industry was easing. As a result, sentiment was high, and holders were asking for sky-high prices, making it difficult to curb the surge. By the close of the market, prices had risen uniformly by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan, and there were many transactions.

### Price Adjustment of Coal in Keelung

[Our Newspaper's Report] Following the latest adjustment of Taiwanese indica rice, the price of Keelung coal from the Four Mines Joint Operations Office was also adjusted yesterday to 62,250 yuan. Imported coal remained unavailable, and the prices of white coal lumps and briquettes remained unchanged.

### Taiwan Sugar Soars

In yesterday's sugar market, buyers were extremely active, and credit within the industry was slightly loose. After the opening, news of soaring rice prices raised sentiment, and buying was very strong.

Grade 45 white refined sugar opened strong at 37,900 yuan, and the upward trend continued, reaching as high as 38,200 yuan. Subsequently, bulls sold at high prices, and the prices of gold, banknotes, and cloth outside the market declined sharply, and credit became slightly tight. Market sentiment turned weak, and the gains were suddenly stalled at noon, falling back 1,100 yuan to close at 37,200 yuan, an increase of 6,000 yuan. Coarse sand sugar saw a unique increase of 7,800 yuan. The prices of other grades, such as white, red, cotton red, sea red, and tea green, all increased by 20% to 25%.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation began selling the 53rd batch of sugar, including one type of Dapu brown sugar in 140-jin bags, priced at 14,500 yuan per dan, with a total of more than 2,000 bags allocated.

### Taiwan Sugar's Market Shrinking

Sales in North China Already Affected

[United Press, Taipei, 3rd] The Taiwan Sugar Corporation, which exports 500,000 tons of sugar annually, is now facing the problem of finding a market. Due to the CCP's occupation of North China, Taiwan Sugar's export route has been affected. China's total annual sugar consumption is estimated at about 800,000 tons, of which about half is supplied by provinces such as Sichuan, Fujian, and Guangdong, and the rest is supplied by Taiwan. Overseas, Japan is one of Taiwan Sugar's main importing countries. In this year's Taiwan Sugar exports, one-fifth has been shipped to Japan. In addition, Korea is also one of Taiwan Sugar's markets, but it does not absorb much. Hong Kong, Singapore, and Thailand have no customers for Taiwan Sugar.

### Silk Spinning

The silk market entered a spinning pattern yesterday. Initially, the high opening price of off-market gold boosted sentiment, but then credit turned from loose to tight, and the overnight interest rate was not low. Bulls were heavily burdened by interest, and selling was very strong.

120 Tianqiao initially traded at 950,000 yuan. After the opening, it saw a slight rise and the market was still stable. Later, news that cotton yarn had risen sharply and then fallen back, and that gold prices were also softening, made sentiment weak. After observing this, the market turned to spinning. After 11 o'clock, most transactions were for next-day positions. Due to the overnight interest rate, the price rose nominally but fell in reality. It closed near noon at 990,000 yuan. In the afternoon, news that all items outside the industry were not doing well continued to weaken the market. Tianqiao was quoted at 960,000 yuan, a further small decrease of 30,000 yuan.

Raw silk yesterday's market initially saw a sharp rise in exchange transfer certificates, and quotations rose accordingly. Foreign merchants showed considerable interest, and sentiment was bullish. Later, exchange transfer certificates were suppressed and fell back, and the gold market also softened, and the trend stopped rising and turned to spinning. Superior grade was initially quoted at 1.2 million yuan. At that time, foreign exchange was falling and gold was quoted low, and holders were unwilling to raise the price again. It once fell back 40,000 yuan. After that, local merchants began to purchase, and the market stabilized (two) to 1.18 million yuan. Finally, exchange transfer certificates rose after falling low, and the market rose overall. It closed at 1.23 million yuan at noon. The market did not fluctuate much in the afternoon, and it was quoted at 1.2 million yuan.

The silk satin market opened yesterday with a firm sentiment. Meiya was initially quoted at 660,000 yuan. It gradually rose slightly in the middle, reaching a high of 680,000 yuan. Afterwards, prices outside the market all rose first and then fell back, and the market turned soft, finally closing at 650,000 yuan.

### Market Stroll

Spectator: Selling Exchange Transfer Certificates Can Withdraw Credit, but it is Difficult to Suppress Market Sentiment

Recent financial and monetary measures, except for the collection of commodity tax in kind, all cater to market psychology. For example, the opening of gold and silver trading, the opening of self-provided foreign exchange, the listing of gold bonds, and the ability to conduct one-day spot arbitrage, etc. If the system of calculating military pay in silver dollars is also allowed for the people, and people are allowed to freely buy and sell foreign currency, I think it will be even more well-received.

The Shanghai market, which has experienced more than ten years of speculative life, has always been felt by the authorities to be difficult to manage, but they cannot let it go. So, managing and letting go has created the situation of the past. Now, things are opening up step by step, and letting go everywhere, and the situation is not too bad. Isn't this a miracle? Not really! There are reasons for this. Please analyze them intelligently.

In the past, walking the road of sailing against the current, with administrative efficiency lagging behind, of course, nothing could be done. Now, it is believed that catering to the speculative psychology of the market and using the power of the Central Bank to determine success or failure in market struggles, using concentrated attacks to deal with scattered troops, can achieve results for a time. In the eyes of the authorities, the market turmoil has never been related to the overall situation, but to the toxic gas of market speculation. Now, they are taking a method of using poison to fight poison to deal with it.

So, what kind of toxic substance is the authorities using as a weapon to fight poison with poison? In a word, so far, there is only one: the selling and absorbing of exchange settlement certificates. After the gold bonds are listed and auctioned, there may be one more weapon.

Analyzing the first weapon, I deeply feel that it will soon become ineffective.

Selling and absorbing foreign exchange certificates uses the law of supply and demand in the market to manipulate the market price of US dollars, and indirectly manipulate the market price of gold. The prices of gold and banknotes have always been the nerve center of all price changes. Foreign exchange transfer certificates are not real goods. Obtaining a transfer certificate means also holding an import license in hand. Therefore, when gold banknotes are rising sharply, the Central Bank can push them out without limit to suppress the rise. If the amount thrown exceeds the number of licenses issued, the transfer certificates will be secretly withdrawn. When the market rebounds again, it can stop absorbing or release them again.

The key to this method is that with a limited number of import licenses, it wants to sell an unlimited number of transfer certificates, so it must immediately withdraw the amount of excess thrown. Therefore, people in the market now know how to deal with it, namely: (1) When transfer certificates are sold, everyone does not sell gold banknotes. If they have the strength, they will buy them at low prices or try to raise the prices of securities and commodities. (2) Once the clear selling stops, they can return with a vengeance. The Central Bank's secret absorption only helps their profits.

This kind of throwing and absorbing of foreign exchange certificates also has the side effect of withdrawing credit. In fact, the two are mutually contradictory. If selling foreign exchange certificates can tighten credit, someone must drag in the transfer certificates, and the market price cannot be effectively suppressed. If they are thrown out heavily and no one absorbs them, then credit cannot be withdrawn. Therefore, today everyone puts the two things together and thinks that selling foreign exchange certificates and withdrawing credit cause the market price to fall. In reality, this does not make sense.

### Off-Market Soaring Prices Boost Sentiment; Rice Prices Jump Out of the 20,000 Yuan Mark

The rice market unfolded a fierce rising trend yesterday. Due to easing credit and rising prices of goods outside the industry, sentiment was extremely tight. The morning market saw the greatest gains, with japonica and indica rice both exceeding 20,000 yuan. The mid-market saw a gradual decline, and the market strengthened again at the close. In the southern market, white japonica rice was 19,500 yuan, an increase of 3,000 yuan. In the northern market, all rice prices also rose by 2,600 to 2,700 yuan, with special high-grade japonica rice reaching 20,600 yuan. A total of 6,157 shi of goods were registered as arriving in the two markets.

Cooking Oil

The rising trend is alarming. Sentiment is high, and holders are trying their best to raise prices. At the opening of the market, soybean oil rose by 10,000 yuan, opening at 78,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil opened at 75,000 yuan. The market was slightly weaker in the later part of the day, with soybean oil closing at 76,000 yuan and rapeseed oil at 74,000 yuan, each rising by 8,000 yuan. A 吉桶 barrel of unrefined oil opened at 92,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 14,000 yuan. Soybean cake had no customers and the price could not rise. 長字 cake was 7,500 yuan, and the market was stable.

Flour rose sharply by 1,000 yuan. The opening of the market saw a sharp rise in gold, banknotes, and rice prices, and credit was stable. Sentiment was extremely bullish, and northern buyers were buying aggressively. Old brands broke the 9,000 yuan mark, setting a new price of 9,200 yuan. 兵船 flour was as high as 8,700 yuan. Midway through the day, news of rice prices falling below the 20,000 yuan mark softened sentiment. Holders were worried about the high prices and were keen to sell, and the market saw a temporary decline. The close of the market saw a rebound of 200 yuan due to continued smooth sales. Old brands were 9,100 yuan and 兵船 flour was 8,550 yuan. Bran followed with a 10% increase. Large packages once hit 7,000 yuan, and closed at 6,750 yuan.

Grains

Continued to rise sharply. Soybeans initially opened with a sharp increase of 20%. 车豆 was initially quoted at 19,000 yuan, but later news that soybean cake was stable softened sentiment. The official closing price was 17,000 yuan. 乍豆 rose by 10%, and 生仁 factories were keen to buy, pushing the price up by more than 20%. Yangzhou 生仁 reached a peak of 48,000 yuan. Corn rose sharply by 40%. Red sorghum once hit 10,000 yuan. Sesame sales remained smooth and continued to rise.

### Cotton Yarn Slightly Higher, Cloth Market Eagerly Buys

The cotton yarn market situation is such that all members of the association can apply for yarn and cloth shipments to various ports in South China, hence the confidence of the people. The initial prices of various yarns were set at high levels, and all of them rose further during the session. By the close, due to a slight tightening of credit, the market reversed downwards, resulting in a slightly higher close compared to the previous day.

42-count Blue Phoenix fell all the way from 1.22 million yuan to close at 1.18 million yuan, still up 80,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix was more popular, rising 140,000 yuan from the previous day. 32-count Silver Moon initially traded at 900,000 yuan, and finally closed at 860,000 yuan, a rise of 40,000 yuan.

12-count Double Horse spot goods initially opened at 700,000 yuan, then were pushed up to 725,000 yuan before falling back to close at 680,000 yuan, 25,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Factory orders were done at 650,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse was at 630,000 yuan, finally up 30,000 yuan. Jin Cheng and Tian Nu and other yarns also rose by about 30,000 yuan, while other yarns generally showed a firm and stable trend.

Yesterday, the cloth market surged again, with no end in sight for the rising trend. This was due to the continued strong interest in buying air, leading all parties to adhere to the principle of holding goods and eagerly buying, causing prices to soar directly. By the close, due to tightening credit within the industry, excessive speculative buying weakened, and the market showed a slight decline.

Dragon Head fine cloth opened in the morning at a new high of 31,700 yuan, then gradually eased, falling to a low of 29,500 yuan. The noon close was 29,800 yuan, a sharp rise of 4,500 yuan from the previous day. In the afternoon, the external market saw further gains, with reported transactions at 31,500 yuan.

In the afternoon, it was quoted at 29,400 yuan. 190 high-grade Shilin factory cloth was as high as 65,000 yuan.

### Chamber of Commerce Requests Tax Bureau to Extend Deadline for Filing Profit Income

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Direct Tax Bureau, requesting permission to extend the deadline for filing profit income for the second half of the 37th year, and to promptly approve the implementation measures for contracted tax payments. The original letter stated: Our Chamber previously received your Bureau's official letter stating that the period for filing profit income for the second half of the 37th year of the Republic, from the date of the letter to February 28th, would be the filing period. We were instructed to order all merchants to comply, and we have informed all businesses to investigate and report accordingly. However, according to reports from various businesses, since the promulgation of the Measures for Changing the Registration of Operating Capital Amount Converted to Gold Yuan, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has also drafted supplementary measures for changing registration due to the devaluation of the Gold Yuan, in order to implement them. However, to date, the aforementioned supplementary measures have not been promulgated, making it impossible to calculate the capital of industry and commerce and to estimate and depreciate property, which delays the final accounts and prevents the declaration of income. We request that you consult with the Tax Bureau, take into account the reality, and grant an extension, among other things. Considering the circumstances, the reason for the inability to apply within the deadline is not due to industry and commerce, so it is impossible to rush the process. We request that your Bureau report the situation while notifying all tax collection offices to temporarily suspend reminders. In addition, the Executive Yuan meeting on February 23rd passed a financial reform plan, which included "Adopting the method of industry-wide apportionment and contracted payment as much as possible for profit income tax in direct taxes, estimating the tax amount based on the business situation of various industries in various regions, and having the industry associations collect and pay within a time limit to simplify the process." The implementation measures are related to the vital interests of industry and commerce, and we request that your Bureau submit them to the Ministry of Finance for prompt approval and promulgation, so that industry and commerce can conduct prior research and prepare accordingly.

### Autobiography of Joe Louis

According to Joe Louis's family, what Joe said in this article was probably the most he had ever said in his life: his tenant farmer life in childhood (6), his experience as a famous boxer (6), why he hated Schmelling the most among his many opponents (6), how he confronted his formidable opponent Jim Crow in the U.S. Army (6), and how the money he earned from boxing was spent. (Translated by Cang Long)

People ask me, "Joe, when you were a kid, did you ever dream of being a millionaire, riding in cars, wearing fancy clothes, and having your pockets full of money?" I tell them, "I couldn't dream such luxurious dreams." Indeed, I never dreamed of such things when I was a child; such thoughts never crossed my mind.

When I emerged from boxing, the newspapers wrote a lot of information about me. Some things seemed almost true because they were publicized over and over again. In fact, a large part of it was wrong. Some people said that I was born vigorous, and some people said that I was born with a murderous look. In fact, I was born clumsy. My mother said that I often fell when I was a child. She said that when she went out to work, she was often worried about leaving me alone at home because I often broke things.

I was born in Alabama, USA, on May 13, 1914. The shack where I was born looked like a gust of wind could blow it down. The house was unpainted, and the wallboards around it were loose and about to collapse. My father was named Munroe Barrow. He was six feet three inches tall and weighed nearly two hundred pounds. I was only two years old when he died.

My mother is now sixty-two years old. She is a good woman and has always been a Baptist, so her children have grown up to be followers of the church. Before I made money from boxing, she worked hard to make a living for our group.

My mother was widowed twice. Her second husband was named Pat Brooks, who was also my stepfather. I am second to the youngest of my siblings. When Pan married my mother, he brought five children of his own.

My mother said that among all my siblings, I was a bad child who liked to cry. When I cried, it was so long and loud that it wouldn't stop until she hit me. I wasn't often sick, and I had a big appetite. When I was a child, people often asked me if I was a fighter. In fact, I didn't fight much because I had a strong sense of self-control and took everything with a smile.

But when I became the boxing champion, newspaper reporters often said that it was difficult to get me to say a few words. My mother said that she should tell these reporters that I am almost the same as when I was a child. I didn't speak as clearly as my siblings. When I was in school, the teacher often asked me to read the same words over and over again. I liked to play alone. At that time, I was too young to work in the garden, so I helped feed the chickens and piglets, and sometimes I helped pick cotton. At that time, we didn't often wear shoes, and we saved our good clothes for Sunday. We only lit kerosene lamps in the shack at night.

Some people think that I spend most of my time enjoying myself now, which may be true. But recalling the days when I was a child, there were very few opportunities to enjoy myself. In those years in Alabama, I never didn't understand what race was. At that time, I played with white children, and we never talked about racial differences. I knew that they had things that I didn't have - whiteness, but I saw these things as natural. (To be continued)

### Basketball League Upset: Encas Thoroughly Defeats Shanghai Police

[Our Newspaper's Report] Last night in the second round of the basketball league, Shanghai Police played against Encas again. Everyone thought that Shanghai Police would definitely win, but they were greatly disappointed and an upset occurred. Shanghai Police suffered an unprecedented defeat of 36-60. In the first half, Shanghai Police trailed by nine points, 16-25. Before the match, there were two matches in Group B2: (1) Dolphin defeated Chenyou (Group B2D), 55-22, first half 26-8. (2) US Meteorology defeated Pingping (Group B2C), 60-40, first half 25-15.

Encas had been losing for several games and was getting worse. Everyone looked down on them. Last night, fresh troops were deployed, and Peter, the host of the US Meteorology team, was pulled in to fight, and suddenly became energetic. Peter was the captain of the 1945-6 US National Navy Championship team. His demeanor was truly extraordinary. His shooting and passing, whether on offense or defense, were quite delicate and beautiful. He scored 24 points alone last night, and with the addition of veteran Ke Liboto, Encas was like a tiger with wings.

Shanghai Police were somewhat careless on the court. When the foreign troops rose sharply, it was too late to catch up. Encas had tall figures, and their defense was tight last night, keeping the Shanghai Police from moving. Liang Yongbiao, He Zeng, and He Jingui were all useless because of their short stature. All the balls under the basket were in the hands of the foreign troops, and there was no way to follow up. When attacking again, there was no way to break through the iron curtain, and they could not get under the basket. Their strength and running were not as good as others, and they could not take care of both ends, so Shanghai Police lost.

Before the main event, there is a preliminary match: Chien Yueh vs. Police Aviation. Tickets cost 150 yuan upstairs, 300 yuan downstairs, and 600 yuan inside the stadium.

The Capital Air Force High Artillery basketball team is extremely powerful in Beijing, having repeatedly defeated strong teams with outstanding records. This time, they have come to Shanghai, specifically requesting the Basketball Association to arrange several friendly matches with formidable local teams to exchange skills.
