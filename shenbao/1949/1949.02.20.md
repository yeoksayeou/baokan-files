### Progress in the Shanghai Delegation's Work: Shao Lizi and Dong Biwu Have a Long Talk; It is Said Mr. Dong Offered Several Suggestions to be Passed to the Government, and Carried a Letter from President Sun to Shanghai

[United Press International, Nanjing, 19th] It was learned tonight that Shao Lizi had a long talk in Beiping with Dong Biwu, Chairman of the North China Liberated Area People's Government. It is said that Mr. Dong offered several suggestions and asked him to forward them to the Nanjing government. Official circles are very optimistic about the peace talks, believing this to be the most important progress since the arrival of the Shanghai Peace Delegation in Beiping, but the details will not be known until the delegation returns.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 19th] According to sources close to Acting President Li, if Mao Zedong wishes to meet, Mr. Li will be happy to meet with Mr. Mao. It is said that Acting President Li has not yet considered meeting with Mr. Mao in person, but if invited, he will fly to Beiping to meet with Mr. Mao. The CCP's "People's Daily" in Beiping once stated that Mr. Li would be welcomed if he decided to come. After hearing the CCP's broadcast on the evening of the 18th, officials are optimistic about the future of peace and point out that this broadcast was "more reasonable in tone" than previous ones. It is noted that in this CCP broadcast, the CCP avoided using the terms "puppet president" and "puppet premier" for Li Zongren and Sun Ke for the first time.

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 19th] Zhong Tianxin flew to Shanghai and then to Nanjing on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane at 3:15 PM on the 19th. Mr. Zhong is carrying a private letter from Premier Sun to Acting President Li and reporting on his trip to Hong Kong to negotiate with the CCP's South China representatives. Before taking off, Mr. Zhong told reporters that, based on his observations of the results of his trip to Hong Kong, the distance between the two sides in the peace talks has gradually narrowed. It seems the Communist side does not want to solve the whole problem by force, because they have controlled vast rural areas for more than ten years, and they feel they lack experience and cadres in managing cities. This may be one of the reasons why Zhu De has been slow to cross the Yangtze River. Mr. Zhong then spoke about the dissatisfaction of some people with the Sun Cabinet, saying that according to the constitution, if more than half of the members of the National Assembly participate and two-thirds approve a new policy, the cabinet can resign if it does not agree with this new policy. Otherwise, the Legislative Yuan has no power to demand the cabinet's resignation. Mr. Zhong also said that Premier Sun's blood pressure is still very high and he cannot go to Nanjing for the time being. If President Li needs him to return to Nanjing, he will also go. Mr. Zhong concluded that he will return to Guangzhou in a week and will not fly to Beiping until the CCP has made a formal statement.

[United Press International, Guangzhou, 19th] Wu Yuhou declared here on the 19th that the Sun Ke Cabinet will independently try to contact the CCP through Hong Kong to exchange views on the peace issue. I will go to Hong Kong on the 20th to convey Sun's views to the CCP officials there and ask them to forward them to the North China authorities. Some observers believe that Sun's move is an attempt to gain political support.

### Zeng Zisheng Issues Statement, Denouncing Wu Yuhou's Words and Actions

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The remarks made by Wu Yuhou, a former representative of the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation, after flying from Shanghai to Guangzhou, have aroused dissatisfaction among other members of the delegation. Zeng Zisheng, the spokesperson for the delegation, issued a statement in Nanjing on the 19th, reiterating that the delegation has been dissolved, and denounced Wu Yuhou's purpose as "using the name of the delegation to contact the Executive Yuan and various parties, while other matters are not of his concern." The CCP has repeatedly broadcast in recent days, accusing those who oppose peace of undermining the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation. In fact, this "undermining" stems from Wu Yuhou's personal misconduct, which has led to attacks on Wu by other members of the delegation. Zeng Zisheng's statement stated that Wu Yuhou's words and actions in Hong Kong and Guangzhou have nothing to do with the delegation, and said: "Previously, there were three representatives in this delegation. My statement today can at least represent the opinions of most representatives such as Qiu Zhizhong, Deng Jiyu, Song Guoshu, and Xia Yuanzhi." Zeng denied the Associated Press report from Hong Kong on the 23rd that Wu Yuhou talked about the delegation's seven suggestions to the CCP, saying that they were all inconsistent with the facts. "The delegation's suggestions did not include Mr. Wu's claim that both sides' troops would retreat 40 li from their current positions and that the location for political consultation would be completely determined by the CCP. Other items were also mostly wrong and incoherent." Zeng also stated: "It is rumored that Mr. Wu has defrauded the government of a large sum of money, which has nothing to do with us."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] It is reported that the National Policy Research Association of Chinese University Professors will hold a meeting in Shanghai soon to re-elect the standing committee. Wu Yuhou's words and actions are also expected to be discussed.

Zhang Yaoming's Remarks at a Meeting in Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Zhang Yaoming, Commander of the Capital Garrison, attended the Nanjing Municipal Council at 10:00 AM on the 19th. In addition to reporting on the maintenance of security and military discipline in the capital, he also emphasized the importance of comprehensive peace. Zhang said that the atmosphere of peace has been rampant lately, but peace must be able to bring peace, and it must be comprehensive peace. Otherwise, it is surrender. Therefore, what we demand is comprehensive peace. If it is partial peace, it will become partial surrender. Nanjing has ample troops and the natural barrier of the Yangtze River. There is absolutely nothing to fear. Therefore, everyone should look forward and not look at those who are fleeing to places like Taiwan. The Kuomintang still has 90% of its potential. As long as everyone is determined to reform and unite, the comprehensive peace we seek will surely succeed.

### Acting President Li Convenes Financial and Economic Officials to Continue Discussing New Economic Plan; Rumors of Bank and Money Shops Taking Holidays in Shanghai are Untrue

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Financial and economic officials continued to discuss the new economic plan in Nanjing on the 19th. Acting President Li convened Xu Kan, Liu Gongyun, and others on the evening of the 18th for a meeting that lasted until 12:00 AM. At 2:30 PM on the 19th, Acting President Li convened Xu Kan, Liu Gongyun, Pang Songzhou, and others at his residence to continue in-depth discussions on new economic measures.

Xu and Liu visited Yu Youren and Gu Zhutong respectively in the morning of the 19th. At 1:30 PM, Xu Kan visited Yan Xishan, and they talked for nearly an hour. At 7:00 PM, Zhou Zhirou hosted a banquet for Xu and others.

[Our Report] Yesterday, there were rumors in the market that the government would order banks and money shops to take a three-day holiday starting tomorrow and impose restrictions on withdrawals in order to implement the new economic plan. The reporter inquired about this matter from a person in charge of the Bankers Association, who said: "Absolutely not." If the government has such measures, it will definitely notify the Banking Regulatory Bureau and then the Bankers Association to inform the member banks and shops to comply. But as of tonight, the Association has not received any notice, and Director Bi Delin also said that he had not heard of it when he spoke with him. In my personal opinion, the rumor may be due to the closure of banks and money shops during the currency reform. Therefore, on the eve of the implementation of this new plan, the market has this speculation. However, if silver dollars are issued and the free trading of gold and silver is allowed, it is completely different from the nature of past currency reforms. Therefore, the holiday for banks and shops is unlikely to become a reality.

### Zhang Zhizhong Returns to Lanzhou Ahead of Schedule to Convene Military and Political Leaders to Discuss Stability in the Northwest

### The Amount of Gold Yuan Issued is About 20 Billion

Rumors of Over 100 Billion are Groundless

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 19th] It is rumored that the total amount of Gold Yuan issued by the government has reached 80 billion yuan as of recently, or even over 100 billion yuan. The reporter inquired about this matter from a responsible person in the relevant authorities, who said: "The actual amount issued is about 20 billion yuan. External speculation is groundless." He further told the reporter that if the market price of gold is 100,000 yuan per tael, it is only equivalent to 200,000 taels of gold, while the government currently controls more than 4 million taels of gold, and other foreign exchange, silver, and materials are not included. The current depreciation of the Gold Yuan and the high prices are not entirely due to inflation. The main factor is the psychology of most people, which is caused by the instability of the overall situation. The financial authorities have drafted a complete plan to reorganize finances and stabilize the financial economy, which will be implemented soon. Finally, he told the reporter in a very firm tone that, from his personal observation, the current financial situation is not a problem in itself. The key is how to clarify the current situation and stabilize the people's hearts across the country.

### ECA China Mission Chief in North China Protests to the Communist Side, Considering the Removal of Flour as Illegal Occupation

[United Press, This City] The China Mission of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) issued a statement simultaneously in Peiping and Shanghai on the 19th. It was a letter from the ECA's North China representative, Davis, to Ye Jianying, Chairman of the Peiping Military Control Commission, protesting that eleven armed Communist soldiers had removed several bags of flour from a warehouse rented by the ECA at the Dutch Embassy. Although no violence was used, it could not be regarded as anything other than illegal occupation. The ECA was willing to hand over the flour to the Peiping Grain Ration Committee for distribution, provided that the Communist authorities issue a formal receipt, acknowledging that the flour would not be allocated to military and political personnel. As there was no formal receipt from the People's Government receiving authority, the flour had to be regarded as having been confiscated. It was hoped that the legitimate Communist authorities would promptly investigate upon receiving the report to seek a remedy. At the time the protest was being drafted, the illegal removal was still in progress.

### From "He" and "Ke" to the Buddhist Precept of Non-Killing

— Pan Gongzhan

— Written to solicit members for the Disaster Relief Dharma Assembly and the Buddhist Youth Association —

Everyone now longs for peace, not only we Chinese, but also the people of other countries all hope to end war and disarm, and live in peace and contentment. The reason why the United Nations was established is to try to create lasting peace for mankind. Peace is truly something that resonates in the hearts of people, a universally shared sentiment.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen's last words when he was dying were: "Peace, struggle, save China!" In the thousands of years of traditional cultural nurturing, Chinese people have become peace-loving almost by nature. Confucius claimed not to have studied the art of war; Mencius said, "There is no righteous war in the Spring and Autumn period," and also said, "He who does not delight in killing can unify [the empire]"; Lao Tzu said, "Fine weapons are inauspicious." Even Sun Tzu, who wrote on the art of war, said, "War is a matter of great importance to the state, the ground of life and death, the way of survival or ruin. It is imperative to examine it." All this shows that the Chinese nation was nurtured and grew up in a culture of peace and not war. However, why is it that after years of war, everyone is appealing for peace at the top of their lungs, but peace still cannot be achieved soon?

I believe that "peace" is the opposite of war. War must involve both sides, so peace must also be felt as an urgent need by both sides. Both sides must have the grace of mutual understanding and concession, and both sides must have the idea of putting themselves in the other's shoes. Only then can we hope to get closer to it. In other words, to achieve the "harmony" of peace, we must first achieve the "balance" of peace. So how can we get closer to "balance"? We must earnestly start by approaching the "middle" path. The Doctrine of the Mean says: "The Middle is the great root of the world; Harmony is the universal path of the world. When the Middle and Harmony are attained, heaven and earth are in their proper positions, and all things flourish." Only with "Middle" can we avoid bias; only without bias can we have balance; only with balance can we have harmony. Therefore, if we want to seek peace by using the method of "either the East wind prevails over the West wind, or the West wind prevails over the East wind," then it will inevitably lead to cyclical retaliation, which will never end, and true and lasting peace may be difficult to obtain. The reason why Buddhists advocate "enmity should be resolved, not created" is probably because of this.

Amidst the calls for peace, the Yichou Disaster Relief Dharma Assembly for the Departed and Benefiting the Living has been held in Shanghai since February 15th, and all temples and Buddhist organizations across the country are also invited to practice Dharma together to relieve disasters. At the same time, the Shanghai Buddhist Youth Association is also starting its third membership drive today (the 20th), engaging in the work of propagating the Dharma and benefiting sentient beings. Some may think that in today's world of national affairs in turmoil and human lives as insignificant as ants, not engaging in some work to save the country and the people, but only advocating reliance on the Three Jewels and seeking help from the Buddha, is it not falling into passivity and bordering on superstition? In fact, this view is a secular prejudice and fails to truly see the true meaning of Buddhism. On the contrary, I believe that if the world's humanity wants true peace, it must promote Buddhism, especially starting with the precept of non-killing. As a novice Buddhist disciple, I would like to offer four humble suggestions.

First, Buddhism advocates perfect equality. Sakyamuni Buddha, as a prince, devoted himself to asceticism and cultivation, and after attaining enlightenment, he taught the Dharma for forty-nine years. His motivation was entirely to have compassion for all sentient beings and to save all sentient beings. The Buddha's intention was to advocate the equality of all sentient beings in the entire universe. Of course, the Buddha is the one to whom humans and gods turn to for guidance, but the Buddha teaches people to observe, understand their minds, and see their nature, so that everyone can truly know that, as the Avatamsaka Sutra says, "The mind, the Buddha, and sentient beings, these three are without difference." In other words, all sentient beings inherently possess Buddha-nature; all sentient beings can become Buddhas. Deluded, they are sentient beings; enlightened, they become Buddhas. Just think, among the sentient beings in the six realms of reincarnation, whether they are gods, humans, asuras, animals, hungry ghosts, or in hell, as long as they diligently cultivate, turn from delusion to enlightenment, they can all become Buddhas. With such a vast mind and thorough understanding, is there any doctrine in the world, past and present, that can surpass the teachings of Buddhism in emphasizing equality? Those who advocate class struggle naturally do not emphasize equality for other classes; those who advocate equality for all people in a country may not emphasize equality for other races; even if they further advocate equality for all humans, they naturally may not be willing to emphasize equality for sentient beings other than humans. Zhang Taiyan once said: "Emptiness is not the original intention of Buddhism; … The five precepts make people do good, … which is not unique to Buddhism; in my opinion, the meaning of equality, whether in this world or beyond, should all be regarded as the law, which is truly the superior aspect of Buddhism. … True equality means not only not having different thoughts towards all things, but also completely eliminating distinctions between right and wrong, good and evil. … Now in the era of the Republic, ranks have been leveled, but factional fighting is even more severe. If this way is used to help them, perhaps it can be done." Zhang's words in the early years of the Republic truly pointed out that Buddhism is the truth for saving the world for thousands of years. Now, to pray for peace, everyone must sincerely believe in the Buddhist teachings of equality, and never have the idea of "not a relative or friend" towards sentient beings (not to mention people towards people). Truly forgetting self and others, treating relatives and strangers equally, and then everyone sincerely repenting of all past evil deeds, working together in harmony, and starting anew with a peaceful and harmonious mind, will naturally attract auspiciousness, relieve disasters and end wars, and bring peace and prosperity to the country and the world.

Second, Buddhism advocates actively saving the world. Many people think that Buddhism talks about emptiness, teaches people to know that "the four elements are all empty," and takes "ending birth and death and leaving the world" as an ideal, thus denouncing Buddhism as being world-weary and destructive to humanity. I used to think so too. But after a little research, I realized that what I saw was seemingly true but not actually true. The true spirit of Mahayana Buddhism is the word "non-form." The Diamond Sutra says, "If one sees all forms as non-forms, then one sees the Tathagata." The most essential meaning of non-form lies in "non-self-form." The so-called emptiness of the four elements is as the Brahma Net Sutra says: "All earth and water are my previous bodies, all fire and wind are my original substance." It makes people understand that "my" body is transformed by the four elements of earth, water, fire, and wind, and has no value to cling to. That is where the so-called "emptiness" lies. However, the Buddha wants to save the world and benefit sentient beings with the heart of great compassion, great mercy, great joy, and great equanimity. Therefore, Buddhism is definitely not empty and becomes "non-empty." Because of thorough "emptiness," one can completely forget oneself. A person with "non-self-form" will naturally not hesitate to sacrifice oneself at any time and in any place. Because of thorough "non-emptiness," one can make the great vow to save the world and benefit sentient beings, and perform the merit of sacrificing oneself for the benefit of others. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas all achieve the "worldly" attainment and fulfill the "worldly" great vows. The Buddha said: "I should go to hell. Not only go to hell, but also dwell in hell; not only dwell there permanently, but also always rejoice in hell; not only always rejoice, but also beautify hell." With such a compassionate great vow to save the world, there is truly no one more active than him. Buddhism teaches people to cultivate the six paramitas, and giving and patience are extremely important paths. If one can truly use the spirit of giving and patience to save the world and benefit sentient beings, and to seek peace, can peace not be achieved? (Continued on page seven)

### Railway Freight, Postal and Telegraph Rates Adjusted Every Ten Days According to a Formula; New Rates for the Last Ten Days of the Month to Be Announced for the First Time Today

[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 19th] Vice Minister Ling Hongxun of the Ministry of Communications announced to reporters today that the transportation and communication businesses under the ministry, except for aviation and water transport, which are self-sufficient and adjust prices at any time, railway freight and postal and telegraph rates have been subsidized by the government. Now that the national treasury cannot bear the burden, the expenses of various industries are often difficult, and crises occur frequently. In order to remedy this urgently, the ministry has specially formulated the latest formulaic adjustment method based on the National Enterprise Reorganization Law recently passed by the Legislative Yuan, and it has been approved by the Executive Yuan in its 44th meeting, ordering the ministry to conduct a trial run starting from the 21st of this month, and then submit the method and results to the Legislative Yuan. The method is as follows: (1) The new railway price is equal to the pre-war price multiplied by one-half of the current rice price multiple plus one-half of the coal price multiple. (2) The new postal price is equal to 5/10 of the pre-war price multiplied by the rice price multiple, plus 3/10 of the newsprint price multiple, plus 2/10 of the gasoline price multiple. (3) The new telegraph price is equal to 5/10 of the pre-war price multiplied by the rice price multiple, plus 3/10 of the newsprint price multiple, plus 2/10 of the electrical materials multiple. During the trial run period, the above prices will be reduced by at least 40% of the cost and will be adjusted once on the 1st, 11th, and 21st of each month, but if the price change does not exceed 20%, no adjustment will be made. As for the multiples of rice price, coal price, electrical material price, and newsprint price, the multiples of the prices of these items in the eight regions of Guangzhou, Kunming, Shanghai, Beijing, Hankou, Lanzhou, Guilin, and Chongqing will be investigated once on the 5th, 15th, and 25th of each month respectively, and the average price will be used as the benchmark for the multiple. Except for railway prices, which will be adjusted by region, the remaining new postal and telegraph prices will be announced uniformly on schedule. In addition, the first adjusted new prices will be announced in Guangzhou at noon on the 20th.

[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 19th] The measures for increasing postal, telegraph, and railway prices will be officially implemented from the 21st. According to Vice Minister Ling of the Ministry of Communications, this price increase is the most reasonable adjustment in the past. In the future, revenue and expenditure can be close to balance, and active improvements will be made to seek the welfare of the people of the country. The treatment of employees of transportation enterprises will also be adjusted.

### US Government to Request Congressional Authorization for Military Aid to Western European Countries, Totaling Between 1 and 2 Billion, Seven Nations Confer on North Atlantic Treaty

[Our Own Dispatch] Washington, 19th Broadcast: Senior government officials stated that after submitting the Atlantic Pact to Congress, the US government will separately request foreign authorization to provide military aid to European countries. This case will be "global" in scope, and the Scandinavian countries will not be excluded from this assistance. The total value of this military aid will be between one and two billion US dollars. The wording and detailed contents of this case will depend on the changes in the situation in the coming months.

[Our Own Dispatch] Washington, 19th Broadcast: Today, Acheson abruptly held an important meeting with the ambassadors of Canada and five Western European countries regarding the Atlantic Pact. A State Department spokesperson stated that this meeting was of an "informal" discussion nature, and its purpose was to inform these six countries of Acheson's negotiations with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday. It is reported that in the previous meeting, Acheson requested that the obligations undertaken by the United States in the treaty should not mention the possibility of the United States providing military aid. However, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee believes that the pact does not need to explicitly stipulate that the US government would absolutely not use force if a signatory country is attacked. During the discussion of the pact, the United States pointed out that only Congress has the power to declare war, so the United States wants to emphasize in the treaty that each signatory country has the autonomy to decide what actions to take in response to armed attacks.

[United Press Washington, 19th Dispatch] The Secretary of State and key senators began jointly studying the North Atlantic Treaty on the 19th. Acheson delivered the initial draft of the highly confidential seven-nation pact to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for review last night. The committee did not raise serious objections to Acheson continuing negotiations on the original basis. This treaty, which aims to prevent European aggression, guarantees that the United States will take immediate action to assist any signatory country when attacked, but the question of what steps should be taken will be decided freely by each country. During the meeting, Senator Lodge and several other senators argued that the pact should be strengthened further. They urged Acheson to explicitly state in the pact that the United States would definitely use "overwhelming military force to counter any aggression." However, Committee Chairman Connally and Senator Vandenberg, the top foreign policy spokesmen for both parties in the Senate, warned that rigidly stipulating the obligation to participate in the war would cause the pact to lose supporting votes when submitted to the Senate for approval.

### Sweden Deeply Fears Being Drawn into the Cold War, Becoming a Second Turkey, Foreign Ministers of the Three Nordic Countries Discuss Joint Defense

[United Press Oslo, 18th Dispatch] The foreign ministers of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark discussed the issue of Scandinavian defense on the 18th, and Norwegian Prime Minister Gerhardsen also participated in the talks. It is understood that the main issue of the talks was Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange's visit to Washington to discuss the Atlantic Pact. Swedish Foreign Minister Undén and Danish Foreign Minister Hertoft came here to attend the Norwegian Labor Party Congress because they are the leaders of the Labor Parties in their respective countries. Well-informed sources believe that the Labor Party Congress will agree with the cautious attitude adopted by the Norwegian government towards the Atlantic Pact.

[Associated Press New York, 18th Dispatch] Sweden fears that Norway will become Turkey, adding a new term to the Cold War. It is said that what Swedish officials fear is that if Norway signs the North Atlantic Treaty, the Soviet Union will not only take diplomatic measures, but also station troops on the border to threaten Norway, forcing it to mobilize its troops, leading to economic exhaustion and increased dependence on foreign aid, thus increasing the burden on the United States and creating another chain reaction in the Cold War. The fear is that the Soviet Union's demonstration against Norway will involve Sweden itself, that is, the Soviet army will occupy the Finnish Åland Islands facing the Swedish capital, tantamount to pointing a pistol directly at the heart of Sweden. In this way, Sweden will also become Turkey. Driven by the pressure of expansionists, the Soviet Union forces other countries to spend huge sums of money and implement military and economic mobilization, placing the whole world in Turkey's position. Whether this move is intentional is unknown, but from the Soviet Union's standpoint, its effect is to weaken the capitalist economy. According to Communist dogma, as this effect deepens, it can cause capitalist countries to kill each other due to forced competition, leading to collapse, and the Communist Party can reap the benefits without effort and carry out a world revolution. The Soviet Union had anticipated this when Western countries moved towards World War II. On the one hand, it signed a neutrality treaty with Germany, without which Hitler would not have dared to invade Poland; on the other hand, it signed a non-aggression treaty with Japan, without which the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor would not have occurred.

### Turkey Refuses to Participate in Atlantic Pact

### Soviet Union Develops the Arctic, Prepares to Evacuate Industry in Wartime

[Associated Press Montreal, Canada, 18th Dispatch] Arctic explorer Stefansson said today that the Soviet Union's development of the Arctic is far more advanced than that of the United States. Currently, the Soviet Union has at least six cities within the Arctic Circle, each with a population of one million. Canada and Alaska have only two bases within the Arctic Circle, each with only 300 people. The Soviet Union's development of the Arctic proves its pursuit of a defensive strategy to evacuate the industry of major cities to safe locations in wartime. Although Soviet Arctic cities are not comparable to fortresses, they are undoubtedly equipped with good airfields.

### Evatt Announces Seamless Cooperation Between US and Australia

### British Upper House Members to Request Government to Strengthen Defense in the Far East, Will Raise Questions on Hong Kong and Malaya Situation

[Our Own Dispatch] London, 19th Broadcast: When the House of Lords meets next Wednesday, questions will be raised to the government: What steps will the British government take to deal with the progress of the Communist Party in Southeast Asia? At that time, Monckton and Bridgeman will report on the new developments in the Far East and request the government to strengthen defense in the Far East.

Intelligence sources have compiled detailed reports on the Communist Party's invasion of Vietnam, Thailand, Burma, Malaya, and other countries, and stressed that the Communist activities in various places are almost entirely under the control of Chinese.

### If the Soviet Union Controls Japan, It Will Knock on Australia's Door

[United Press Washington, 18th Dispatch] Former US military governor of Japan, Acheson, who has now retired, said on the 18th that if the Communist Party controls Japan, the Soviet-controlled Japanese army could sweep down to Australia's door within ten days. He said: "If the Soviet Union gains Japan, this could happen again in a few years, because the Soviet Union will definitely be able to combine the soybeans, iron, and coal of the Northeast with Japan's industrial potential and knowledge."

### Soviet Union Returns Leased Ship to US

### Rumor that Eisenhower Will Visit Greece to Consolidate Mediterranean Defense, Moscow Attaches Great Importance to This

[Associated Press Moscow, 18th Dispatch] The appointment of former US Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has attracted attention from Soviet newspapers. Most newspapers commented that the appointment is related to the US government's plan to establish a General Staff to handle European aid affairs. It is expected that Eisenhower will soon visit Greece to help strengthen the defense of the Mediterranean region. In addition to paying close attention to the situation in the Scandinavian Peninsula, the newspapers are also very concerned about the Mediterranean and Middle East regions, believing that the United States is trying to win over Middle Eastern countries such as Iran, Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan to participate in the future North Atlantic Alliance, to reconcile Mediterranean countries such as Italy with Spain, and to request the trusteeship of Tripolitania.

### To Combat Asian Communism, Britain Forms Eighth Dominion, Hong Kong, Malaya, and Singapore Will Be Included

[Associated Press London, 18th Dispatch] The British Commonwealth is brewing a new dominion in Southeast Asia. According to British Colonial Undersecretary Williams today told the Associated Press reporter: This matter is a long way off, but it is definitely in the plan. The new dominion will occupy 132,692 square miles and have a population of nearly six and a half million. The Malayan Federation, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo, and Brunei are already included. Hong Kong may also join.

The new Southeast Asian dominion is of great importance to British and American economic relations. The area produces the most important raw materials, and many raw materials are not found elsewhere. Rubber, tin, oil, pepper, coconut, and sago are part of the output, and Sarawak also has gold mines. In political terms, there is something more important than economics, that is, the autonomous government can give a real blow to communism. According to Williams, Britain is not paying lip service and is sincere in supporting the independence of Southeast Asia. The Southeast Asian dominion will be the eighth British dominion, and its position is the same as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, or Ceylon.

They are fighting from elaborately built bunkers and have very long tunnels that encircle a vast area. They carry the latest automatic weapons and resist the government forces by relying on modern warfare tactics learned from the British army in the last war.

### Liu Weichi Accused of Corruption Remains a Mystery, Factory Directors of China Textile Company Deny Making Accusations, Supervisory Commission Office is Conducting a Thorough Investigation

[Our Own Dispatch] The Supervisory Commission Office of the Supervisory Yuan in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province has begun a thorough investigation of the case of Liu Weichi, Minister of Industry and Commerce, on the 19th. According to reports, the factory directors of China Textile Company telegraphed the Supervisory Commission Office to request a thorough investigation of the corruption and malfeasance of Liu Weichi, chairman of the company. Supervisors Yu Peihou and Ni Bi of the office paid great attention to this and, in addition to immediately dispatching personnel to investigate, will personally visit relevant agencies for further investigation.

### General Manager of China Textile Company Issues Statement Yesterday

[Our Own Dispatch] Gu Yuchun, General Manager of China Textile Construction Company, issued a written statement in response to the report on the 19th that the factory directors of the company had jointly applied to Acting President Li and the Supervisory Yuan for a thorough investigation of Liu Weichi, chairman of the company: After seeing the report yesterday morning, I immediately telephoned the factory directors to inquire about the matter. According to the factory directors, there was no joint report to Acting President Li and the Supervisory Yuan. Among the points mentioned in the report, regarding the 18 million yuan surplus of the company in 1948 that was transferred to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the 8 million yuan that was remitted to Nanjing, and the 10 million yuan that was returned, were returned to the Guangzhou office of the company by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, instructing it to be directly turned over to the national treasury. In addition, regarding the houses rented by the executive directors and secretaries of the board of directors, they were rented by the company in accordance with normal procedures. The company did not bear the cost of repairing and painting Liu Weichi's official residence, as well as the daily expenses of the official residence. As for the other points, such as renting guest houses in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, they are also untrue.

[Central News Agency Dispatch] Regarding the case reported in the newspapers that the factory directors of Textile Construction Company accused Liu Weichi, chairman of the company, of abusing his power and suspected of corruption, the company authorities explained as follows yesterday: 1. Temporary advances In the past month, after the Executive Yuan decided to evacuate the engineering staff to work elsewhere, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce followed the decision of the Political Council and began to evacuate. Because of the urgent timing, it was proposed to borrow funds temporarily from Textile Construction Company to cope with the changes. The company authorities entrusted the Bank of China to remit funds to Beijing in batches. However, when the funds arrived, the main personnel of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had already left Beijing, and the remittances were not received and were returned. 2. The cost of repairing houses was paid by the board of directors. Before Liu took office, the private residence had been in disrepair for many years, so it was simply repaired. All expenses were paid by Liu himself. The statement that the cost was paid by the board of directors is not true. 3. Directors and secretaries received huge amounts of money for housing. The houses were rented by the company authorities and allocated to various members for residence. The so-called receipt of housing expenses is not true. 4. Abuse of private power. The executive directors are elected by the board of directors in accordance with the regulations. The so-called designation is not true; the appointment of Lu Weipu as acting deputy general manager was because another deputy general manager was on sick leave and was recuperating elsewhere. In order to prevent the company's business from being interrupted, it was decided by the board of directors to invite Chief Engineer Xu Weipu to act concurrently; as for other staff members, the increase to more than 30 people is even more untrue. The quota of staff members on the board of directors is not so large, and there are only eleven people working now, which has not increased compared to before. It is also learned that the inside story of this matter is purely a personnel dispute.

### Restaurants and Cafes Defy Orders Not to Collect Settlement Fees on Behalf of the Government

In order to raise funds for the settlement fees of new recruits, the city authorities previously formulated a method by the Civil Affairs Bureau last winter to collect an additional fee based on the price in the city's dance halls and restaurants and cafes with musical facilities and no swimming pools. Since this method was submitted to the municipal government for approval and implementation, the performance of collecting fees on behalf of the government in various dance halls has been quite good. However, the restaurant and cafe industries have refused to obey orders and have not collected additional fees to date. The Civil Affairs Bureau has recently sent a letter to the municipal government requesting it to order the police bureau to order the restaurant and cafe industries to collect fees on behalf of the government in accordance with the law. If they continue to refuse, they will be resolutely suspended from business.

### Mayor's Cup: Zhi Chao Eliminates Leader with Two Goals; Qing Bai Jing Wu to Meet Today

[Our Newspaper's Report] The fourth Mayor's Cup football match kicked off yesterday. In the first match, Long Tou played against Zhi Chao at Yiyuan. As a result, to the surprise of 2,000 spectators, Zhi Chao fought hard and eliminated Long Tou 2-0, advancing to the second week. Zhi Chao scored two goals in the first half, and there were no goals in the second half. Zhi Chao's young players fought bravely yesterday and worked exceptionally hard. Wu Qixiang sat in the center, completely shattering Long Tou's offensives time and time again. It can be said that Long Tou's forwards could hardly cross the border.

Long Tou attacked first but did not gain anything. Zhi Chao counterattacked. Shang Shiqi advanced quickly along the side and passed to the center. The ball fell to the left, and Yu Qiaxing passed to the right. Qian Yuanqing shot fiercely from 25 yards out, and the ball went straight into the upper right corner of the goal. Gao Weichen was stunned and didn't know what to do. Zhi Chao took the lead and their morale was greatly boosted. Long Tou, inexplicably losing this goal first, launched a fierce counterattack. Zhang Jiliang and Yao Qingsheng shot from near and far, high and low, but none of them hit the target. Zhi Chao's defense line, under the leadership of Wu Qixiang, was as solid as a rock. Jiang Kun penetrated deeply, forcing a corner kick, but it was also ineffective. After half an hour, Yan Chengkuan was injured and left the field, and Wang Burong replaced him. Zhi Chao's Zhu Jiazheng entered along the side again, and Wang Baoshan was unable to stop him. The ball passed to the center, and Yu Qiaxing slid to the ground and scored again. In the first half, Zhi Chao took a 2-0 advantage.

In the second half, the two teams reunited. Long Tou replaced Yao Qingsheng with Zhang Quangen. Zhi Chao, with victory in hand, took a defensive stance and moved the entire army back, thus forming a tug-of-war. Xu Dawei was injured and Xu Guoping replaced him. Jiang Lei committed a foul, and Wang Baoshan took the penalty, but there were no results. Zhi Chao gradually showed signs of fatigue, and Long Tou wanted to advance but had no way. When the whistle sounded, Zhi Chao eliminated Long Tou 2-0.

In addition, there is a letter to newspaper offices across the country to be forwarded to compatriots from all walks of life, which states: "We are publishing a letter to the public because the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education are in a state of panic and dispersal, ignoring our lives, and there is no way to appeal. I have investigated that the salaries of the current officials are the same as those of public education personnel. If there is no improper income, they should have the same miserable fate as us, but in fact, some of them own a large amount of gold notes, and some have widely established land and mansions in cities at home and abroad. The level of enjoyment on weekdays exceeds that of ancient emperors. Even the same civil servants and public tea servants of state-owned financial and enterprise institutions monopolized by them have monthly salaries that are many times higher than ours and are sufficient to be looked at. It seems that this kind of style of enriching oneself by鑒雙 and destroying teachers with a policy of starvation, the measures are absurd, and there is no precedent in history. You will also feel indignant when you hear about it. Please give your support and jointly appeal, and I cannot thank you enough."

Letter to the Public The original text is as follows: We are professors from national colleges and universities in Shanghai. We have dedicated ourselves to university education for many years, and only want to do our best to educate the next generation of young people. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, we were displaced and suffered hardships, which is what Chinese citizens should have endured. Unexpectedly, after the victory, the government authorities not only did not pay attention to improving our lives, but also failed to reform the currency system, allowing the currency value to fall again and again. The salaries issued to us were discounted more and more severely, making it impossible for us to maintain our lives. Our base salary is 600 yuan per month at the highest, and 240 yuan per month at the lowest. The salaries of lecturers, teaching assistants, and staff are even lower. Taking the highest level as an example, after deducting two discounts, based on a 15-fold calculation, we get 2,070 gold yuan coupons per month, which is only the market price.

About one silver dollar

Even this amount, because the Executive Yuan left Beijing in a hurry and no one was in charge, I don’t know how much it will be worth when it gets into our hands. In terms of what we get right now, it is not enough to buy two pecks of rice, and it is not enough to buy one and a half catties of vegetables per day. The annual income is not enough to pay for the current monthly water, electricity, and gas needs. Even with the total allocation of three pecks of rice, it is not easy to support one person. Where can we talk about "supporting our parents and raising our children", let alone sending our children to school? We educate other people's children, but we are forced to let our own children drop out of school. What is more unfair in the world than this? As for the so-called academic research fees, 50 yuan per month for professors and 40 yuan per month for associate professors is not enough to buy a copy of the day's newspaper. The Shanghai Municipal Government announced that the living index for the first half of February was 349 times, but we don’t know what ours is. Our opinion is that we should issue our original salaries in full and without any discounts, according to the Shanghai price index on a regular basis.

After the Sun Cabinet was established

Not only did it shelve the proposal to adjust the salaries of public education personnel submitted to the Legislative Yuan for execution, but also after the acting minister of education took office, he remained deaf to the appeals of the presidents and professors of national universities in Shanghai. Before the Communist guns were heard in the capital, acting minister Chen Xueping had already fled to Guangzhou with money. He only cares about the peace of mind of a few high-ranking officials and cruelly leaves millions of people in the academic community starving and freezing. He is truly derelict of his duties and has no regard for education. If it were not for this time, representatives went to Beijing to ask for assistance,

I managed to get 100 million to return

It would be difficult for the academic community here to survive, but it is still a drop in the bucket. We were forced to make a special announcement to the public, so that the world would know the crimes of dereliction of duty and the reality of our hard work in maintaining our livelihood. I dare to ask for a common rise to request President Li and the two legislative chambers to impeach them separately in accordance with the law, and at the same time urge the Executive Yuan to quickly follow the Legislative Yuan's resolution to adjust the salaries of public education personnel, and issue them in full and without any discounts according to the local price index every half month, and reasonably adjust the research fees, and at the same time follow the example of Nanjing and quickly issue the contingency expenses according to the adjusted salary amount to appease public anger and relieve the suffering."

### National University Presidents Resign, Acting Minister Sends Telegram to Persuade Them to Stay

Schools Ask the Central Bank to Overdraft at 75 Times

[Our Newspaper's Report] The presidents of various national colleges and universities in this city previously sent a joint telegram to the Ministry of Education Chen on expenses and sought to resolve them. In the absence of a solution, the presidents of all the colleges expressed their intention to resign. Chen has now replied by telegram to persuade them to stay, and said that he is doing his best to find a way to deal with expenses. The presidents of all the colleges believe that the reply is still empty and there is no specific solution. The Professors' Association held a meeting on the 18th and decided to ask the presidents of all the colleges to go to Guangzhou to urge the adjustment of salaries and the realization of the allocation of contingency funds. To this end, the presidents of all the colleges are studying the appointment of representatives to go to Nanjing or Guangzhou next week to personally request a solution.

[Another Dispatch] The presidents of national colleges and universities expressed their gratitude to the Central Bank for its assistance in allocating funds to the colleges, and yesterday hosted a joint reception at the Sino-British Cultural Association for the heads of the Central Bank's Business Bureau and Treasury Bureau. In order to solve the current financial difficulties, all colleges have asked the Central Bank to approve an overdraft of 75 times.

### Murder of the British Plant Director of the Ewo Brewery, Two Defendants Sentenced to Life Imprisonment Each, Recipient of Stolen Goods Transferred to the District Procuratorate for Re-Investigation

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the case of the robbery and murder of Leonard, the British plant director of Ewo Brewery, the defendants Sun Xianglin, the main culprit, and Wang Kemou, the accomplice, were transferred to the District Court by the Special Criminal Court. Yesterday, Judge Zhai Zhaoping concluded the trial and sentenced Sun Xianglin and Wang Kemou to life imprisonment each for jointly robbing and causing death. Zhang Zhenqiu and Wan Jinfu, the recipients of the stolen goods, were transferred to the District Procuratorate for re-investigation due to procedural irregularities. The defendant Sun Xianglin in this case was originally a worker at the Ewo factory. Later, he was fired for some reason. Knowing that Leonard was wealthy, he conspired with Wang Kemou and Zhang Yongxing, Wang Dongyuan, Chen Linfu, etc., who were at large, to sneak into Leonard's private residence over the wall late at night on February 24 last year, bound Leonard and his wife in the room, and searched extensively. They robbed a large amount of US dollars, gold jewelry, and clothing. When they were about to leave, Sun was angered by Leonard's struggle for help. Sun killed Leonard by hitting him with a beer bottle, and then escaped back the way they came. Later, the police arrested Sun and the other two and transferred them to the Special Court for trial. Later, the Special Court was ordered to be revoked, so the case was transferred to the District Court for trial.

### Improve Police Treatment, Implement Early Next Week

The treatment of police officers in the city police station is meager and their lives are difficult. Mayor Wu has now decided to implement improvement measures, with an additional allocation of two pecks of rice, two catties of pork, two catties of cooking oil, and one catty of vegetables per mother every month. It is known that the above-mentioned improvement measures will be implemented early from next week.

### Stock Exchange to Officially Reopen Tomorrow; In Addition to Stocks, Gold Bonds Also to be Auctioned

[Our Report] The city's stock exchange, which has been closed for six months, has now decided to officially reopen tomorrow. After the reopening, the exchange has decided to auction stocks (including state-owned and private enterprise stocks) and short-term gold bonds. For the private enterprise stock section, in addition to the 34 types already listed before August 19, Zhenhua Paint Company will be added starting tomorrow. The remaining three companies, World Book Company, Pudong Electric, and the Municipal Ferry, will also be listed gradually in the near future. For the state-owned enterprises section, Taiwan Sugar Corporation is expected to be listed tomorrow, while Taiwan Paper is in the process of being listed. China Merchants Bureau will decide after consulting with the Ministry of Transportation, and China Textile Construction Company is rushing to complete the listing procedures. If they can complete it in time, they can also be expected to be listed tomorrow; otherwise, it will be delayed for two days. Trading of stocks will be temporarily limited to the morning session, from 9:30 AM to 12:30 PM daily, except for holidays. Short-term gold bonds will be auctioned as soon as the Ministry of Finance delivers the bond samples and can be traded as one-day futures. The auction time is divided into morning and afternoon sessions. The morning session time is the same as for stocks, and the afternoon session is from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM. The stock exchange will also reconcile accounts with brokers every day starting at 3:30 PM.

Gu Shanchang, the general manager of the exchange, specially convened a discussion with the directors and supervisors of the Brokers Association at 10:30 AM yesterday to exchange detailed opinions on various trading technical issues after the reopening.

At 2:00 PM yesterday, General Manager Gu held a press conference at the exchange. In addition to reporting on the suspension of business on August 19 and the process of this reopening, Mr. Gu said, "Since the closure of our exchange, all rumors and rising prices have not decreased or disappeared due to the closure of our exchange. This proves that the stock exchange market is only affected by rumors and rising prices and is not responsible for creating rumors or leading prices. This reopening is entirely in accordance with the government's decrees, and the task of the stock exchange has also been clearly pointed out as 'The government is allowing the Shanghai Stock Exchange to reopen to channel idle funds and stabilize the economy.'" Mr. Gu concluded, "My principle in handling affairs has always been to be practical and realistic, and I will never deviate from the facts when speaking or acting. I hope that all sectors will offer more guidance."

### Gold Bond Lottery to be Held on March 2nd

[Our Report] It is reported that the first lottery for the return of principal and payment of interest on gold bonds will be held on March 2nd. The National Bank will announce the date and require purchasers to exchange their reservation tickets for official bonds. Yesterday, the price of gold bonds rose again by 2,000 yuan, totaling 77,500 yuan per tael. Gold bond sales have been sluggish, with only over one hundred taels sold daily. Regarding the repeated increase in the listed price of gold bonds, relevant sources explained that there are two purposes: one is to encourage members of society to purchase gold bonds, so the price of gold bonds is rising faster than the black market price of gold; the second is to absorb a large amount of idle funds by increasing the price of gold bonds. Because gold bonds are currently all reservation tickets, they are not yet listed. It is said that the Ministry of Finance has limited the exchange for official bonds to before March 2nd, so the official listing and auction of the official price will be in early March.

### Improvement of Import/Export Management Measures Awaits Executive Yuan Approval

Listed Price Rose Another 2,000 Yuan Yesterday

[Our Report] Improved import and export management measures have been drafted and will be announced once approved by the Executive Yuan. The main points of the new plan are to open up self-provided foreign exchange, implement import and export chains, and within a certain limit, the government will not interfere with import and export goods. Appendices one, two, and three, as well as quotas, will be abolished. The mediation of import and export will still use foreign exchange transfer certificates. At the same time, to encourage exports, the foreign exchange settlement for exports to the government will be reduced from the previous regulations to 20% or 30%.

### Monetary Conditions Gradually Stabilizing

Yesterday was the weekend, and the trend of monetary conditions in the city turned stable across the board. The supply of funds in the market was strong due to the stabilization of prices in recent days, and the interbank lending rate remained high, leading to the release of goods for interest. Demand, on the other hand, turned scarce. The interbank lending rate in the market was around 80 yuan for same-day lending in the morning, but it generally decreased near noon, hovering around 70 yuan, and even 60 yuan was offered.

Cash remained scarce yesterday. External demand did not decrease, while internal supply remained low. Bank notes were even more popular, with discounts firmly at 6 to 8 yuan per 100 yuan. The limit for banks and merchants remained at 5,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan. The cash shortage is unlikely to improve in the short term.

### Cotton Yarn Soars; Cloth Market Listless

The opening price of cotton yarn soared because the rumor of opening up southern transportation was strong, and monetary conditions were easing, so people's hearts were greatly encouraged. Cantonese merchants were seen to be buying smoothly, and local Qing merchants also flocked to absorb it, and the situation was quite booming. Each yarn started a fierce rise, resulting in a stronger increase of 20% compared to the previous one.

42-count Blue Phoenix rose from 580,000 yuan all the way to 640,000 yuan at the close, soaring by 140,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose by 135,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon opened at 450,000 yuan in the morning and finally stood firm at the 500,000 yuan mark, squeezing up by 100,000 yuan.

21-count Double Horse, which had appeared from a low of 330,000 yuan to 310,000 yuan, recovered to 370,000 yuan at noon, finally rising by 70,000 yuan, and was quoted at 400,000 yuan on Monday. 20-count Double Horse rose by 65,000 yuan. Other brands such as Golden Rooster and Jincheng also rose by about 70,000 yuan. 16-count Guangming opened at 275,000 yuan in the morning and broke through the 300,000 yuan mark at noon, reaching a high of 310,000 yuan, an increase of 65,000 yuan compared to the previous one. Other yarns also advanced rapidly towards the peak.

Cotton cloth continued to be sluggish. Although monetary conditions showed signs of easing, people's hearts also turned upward, but because both local and out-of-town merchants had no intention of buying, there was only a "ping-pong" market inside. The market had been raised higher under the pull of the holders, but it fell tired due to the clearing of actual sales. At the closing, it was reported that the price of cotton yarn had risen by about 20%, and the market price was reported to have rebounded, but it was still squeezed smaller than before.

Longtou fine cloth was initially quoted at 15,000 yuan outside the market, but it was traded at 1,400 yuan near noon. Labatong fine cloth retreated from 11,000 yuan to 11,000 yuan, finally falling by 600 yuan. Da Shuanglong fine cloth was 10,400 yuan, with no difference from before.

Sijunzi yuan serge opened at 12,700 yuan and then made small sales down to 11,600 yuan. It recovered to 12,200 yuan at noon, slightly down by 50 yuan. Sijunzi yuan straight tribute finally stood firm at the original level of 12,000 yuan from the previous day. 190 high-grade Shilin cloth factory opened at 33,500 yuan, flowered serge at 15,000 yuan, and Sijunzi yuan government silk at 15,000 yuan. The market atmosphere turned strong in the afternoon, and it was reported that Sijunzi yuan serge was quoted at 14,500 yuan outside the market.

### Rice Prices Trend Hovering; Flour Soars; Oil Market Rises Sharply

Yesterday, the rice price rose and then fell back. The market trend remained hovering. After the market opened, the price of gold notes became smaller again, and people's hearts were calmed. In the middle of the day, monetary conditions suddenly turned loose, and importers absorbed them one after another. Actual sales were smooth, and the market was profitable. Bai geng and Bo dao once rose to 11,000 yuan, but in the late market, they fell back by 400 to 500 yuan due to too much selling by lenders. They were finally squeezed up by 200 to 300 yuan compared to the previous ones. It is estimated that Bai geng was 10,300 yuan, Bo dao was 10,500 yuan, Zao dao was 10,300 yuan, and Te geng was 10,700 yuan.

Flour

The market price rose sharply, because monetary conditions turned loose, and Northern merchants purchased in large quantities, and people's hearts turned firm. At the beginning of the market, Bingshan broke through the 4,000 mark, and the closing price was as high as 4,200 yuan. After the closing, retail investors absorbed quite strongly, and the market price rose again. At the close, the price was as high as 4,400 yuan, which was half a percentage higher than the previous one. The old car was 4,500 yuan yesterday, and the market price outside the market was 4,650 yuan. Hongfeng, Jiancheng, and Dafa all tended to rise, and bran also rose by a percentage. Fuxin large bag was 3,350 yuan.

Miscellaneous grains

Yesterday's market trend was first flat and then firm. In the early market, the financial weakness outside the circle made people's hearts sluggish, and all parties held a wait-and-see attitude. The market trend continued to be tired and flat. Later, it was heard that the rice market had rebounded, and also because of the end of the month, the market atmosphere suddenly vibrated, and retail investors took the opportunity to absorb it. So soybeans turned tired and became firm, and Pinghu merchants traded the most. Che dou opened at 7,800 yuan at the close, and the factory absorbed it frequently, and it rose to 8,500 yuan by noon. The rest of the market was prosperous. Corn fell by 200 to 300 yuan in the early market due to the silence of Qing merchants and unsmooth actual sales. Later, the bean market rebounded, and Huangdu closed at 3,600 yuan at noon. Shengren also rose by a percentage. Yangzhou goods closed at 2,200 yuan. Hongliang also broke through the fourth level, closing at 4,200 yuan at noon.

Edible oil Yesterday, the cloth rose sharply, because the raw material soybeans rose, and the previous day's decline was too strong. Holders had no intention of selling, and monetary conditions also turned loose. All parties' suction power was not weak, and under the hype of the out-of-town merchants, the market price rose step by step. Soybean oil rose by 45,000 yuan in the early market, and people's hearts were greatly shaken. At noon, it closed at 48,000 yuan, which was 8,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Jiangbei raw oil also rose by 7,000 yuan compared to the previous day, closing at 52,000 yuan. Raw rapeseed oil also rose to 44,000 yuan, which was 8,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Soybean cake was not willing to show weakness due to the sharp rise in the oil market. People's hearts were shaken, and the suction power was strong. The market price suddenly returned to the old price. Yesterday's market generally rose by about 30%.

### Guaranteed Reserve Fund for Silver and Money Industry; Exchange Rate for Public Bonds Has Been Specified

[Our Report] It is reported that the Ministry of Finance has stipulated the exchange rate for the public bond portion of the guaranteed reserve fund required by the Shanghai silver and money industry as follows: the US dollar public bond of the 36th year will be calculated at 70% of the exchange settlement certificate. The remaining gold public bond of the 37th year, the Allied Victory Public Bond, the short-term treasury bills, etc., are all calculated at two to twenty. In addition, the interest on the exchanged balance is allowed to be calculated according to the interbank lending rate.

### Shanghai-Taiwan Trade Proceeds as Usual; Adopting Barter Method

Since the Taiwan authorities stopped commercial remittance between Shanghai and Taiwan, people are paying close attention to the situation of Shanghai-Taiwan trade. According to a senior member of the financial community who just returned to Shanghai from Taiwan yesterday, although commercial remittance between Shanghai and Taiwan has been suspended, commercial exchanges can still proceed as usual. Generally, merchants trading with Taiwan now mostly adopt a barter method, that is, transporting goods from Shanghai to exchange for goods produced in Taiwan. This method is now quite popular, and trade is quite developed. The goods transported from Shanghai to Taiwan are mostly cotton textiles, fertilizers, and various industrial products. The goods transported from Taiwan to Shanghai are mostly sugar, coal, fruit, and various local products. The second method is to obtain remittance funds, which is also quite popular in the financial community. Banks or commercial firms in the two places offset each other by clearing accounts. Therefore, Shanghai-Taiwan trade can still proceed as usual.

### Artificial Silk Slightly Recovers; Silk and Satin Market Weak

The artificial silk market stopped falling and rebounded yesterday. The monetary conditions in the market eased, the hidden interest rate fell back, the price of gold outside the industry also rebounded, and the market price of foreign exchange certificates continued to rise, and people's hearts rose. The initial opening price of 120 Bright New Goods was 420,000 for the current day. After the opening, there were frequent news outside the market, and the environment was favorable. Moreover, due to the return of hidden interest rates, retail investors bought in groups, and the market price soared. At noon, the next-day price was 520,000. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.

The transfer certificate of raw silk rose sharply. Exports have already shown signs of improvement. Foreign firms are about to move after being silent, and their buying is slightly increasing. The internal sales price is also optimistic. The holders hold on, and the monetary conditions in the market have eased. Various goods outside the circle have stopped falling and rebounded, and people's hearts are rising. The noon price of premium Lingzu was 570,000, which was 100,000 yuan higher than the previous day's noon price.

Due to the soaring raw materials and the rising price of gold outside the silk and satin circle, people's hearts have changed. The morning price of the Meiya quilt cover was 300,000, and the buying was still strong after the price was called. The price rose by 20,000 yuan in an instant. Afterwards, various merchants sold at high prices, and the buying dissipated. The market conditions turned weak, and the asking price was seen to be lower. The lowest price was 290,000. Near the close, it was heard that the closing prices of various goods outside the circle had risen sharply, and the market trend was good. However, because it first went high and then came back, the foot was weak, and the rising momentum was coming to an end. As a result, the noon price was 310,000. No asking price was heard in the afternoon due to Saturday.

### Domestic Exchange Rate Correction

### From Peace to the Buddhist Precept Against Killing (Continued from Page 2)

Third, Buddhism advocates universal non-killing. The reason we want peace is that war makes living beings suffer. Human war is the extreme of human mutual killing. Chinese war is the extreme of Chinese compatriots killing each other. We know the pain of killing, so we call for peace; then do other living beings who are killed not suffer? To whom do they appeal? Imagine, every day, thousands upon thousands of cattle, sheep, chickens, pigs, and all other animals with life and breath are slaughtered. They all have life, they all have consciousness, and they are innocently killed. How can they not harbor resentment? Lu Fangweng's poem: "The taste of dripping blood and flesh is considered precious, everyone suffers the same pain and grievances cannot be expressed. Put yourself in their place and think in your heart, who would be willing to cut themselves with a knife?" Chan Master Yuan's verse says: "For thousands of years, envy in the bowl, the grievance is as deep as the sea, and the hatred is difficult to calm. If you want to know the catastrophe of war in the world, just listen to the sound of the slaughterhouse at midnight." Now, let's not talk about the principle of cause and effect and retribution, but just imagine that we humans rely on ingenuity to kill the lives of animals every day to satisfy our own desires and are not surprised. Then, among humans, each competes with ingenuity, the strong bully the weak, and the masses abuse the few, to the point where the flames of war fill the sky. People will inevitably regard it as nothing, and perhaps even use the theory of "survival of the fittest" to excuse and cover up their faults. Therefore, if the killing of animals does not stop, it will inevitably lead to people killing each other; if people killing each other does not stop, it will inevitably lead to animals fighting for human flesh. Recently, in the war zone, the dead soldiers and civilians have not been buried and have been pecked at by birds and beasts everywhere. The reason for this can be deeply thought about. Moreover, in a prosperous city like Shanghai, even during wartime, there are many refugees and wailing everywhere, and there are places where delicacies cost tens of thousands of gold per table. How can it be that the vast majority of the population is on the verge of death, while a few wealthy people can still indulge in luxury and enjoy their own desires? Therefore, the starting point for eliminating disasters and praying for peace should be to strive for non-killing. (Which naturally includes not being addicted to killing people.) I heard that the initiators of the Shanghai Disaster Relief Dharma Assembly once sent letters to the municipal government and the Senate, requesting a three-day ban on slaughter during the 49-day Dharma Assembly, in order to invoke auspiciousness and harmony. I think this is a very meaningful thing. Even if it is necessary to supply meat to the garrison troops, it is also good to ban slaughter one extra day each week, allowing the wealthy citizens to save a large amount of pork to transfer to the soldiers' needs, which can also reduce the killing karma of Shanghai citizens. Even if the municipal government is not considering promoting Buddhism, it should also consider the difficulty of material resources and use the method of stipulating the date of the ban on slaughter to force frugality!

Fourth, Buddhism advocates respectful repentance for the deceased. The teachings of Buddhism originally recognize that "all phenomena arise from the mind," so the attachment of the mind at the moment of death is the root of reincarnation in the six realms. Because of this, if we want to benefit living beings and eliminate disasters, we cannot forget the soldiers and civilians who have already died because of war. King Wen's administration of benevolence must first be applied to the poor and helpless people in the four categories of widows, orphans, and the lonely. But we must know that there are also ghosts who have "died without being told"! We fought an eight-year war against Japan, we won, we celebrated, and even many of our high and low officials made "victory money"; but what comfort did the heroic spirits of the thousands upon thousands of soldiers and civilians who sacrificed for the war of resistance receive? We have fought our own war for three years, and now we are asking for peace. As blessed by Heaven, if peace can be realized one day, we will celebrate again, and perhaps some people will make "peace money" again; but what comfort will the heroic spirits of the thousands upon thousands of soldiers and civilians who sacrificed for "liberation" and "suppression of the rebellion" receive? With a turn of our minds, we can suddenly fight or suddenly make peace, but the dead cannot be resurrected! These thousands upon thousands of dead are all "ghosts of the dead who have not been told" who hold grievances! With the spirit suppressed, how can there be a world of light and beauty? Therefore, rituals of repentance and salvation, transcending the souls of the dead, seem passive or close to superstition, but in fact, the most simple and practical thing in the world is to seek peace of mind. We only want to beg for peace, to eliminate the current disasters, and to benefit our own lives, but we forget this large group of compatriots who have lost their "lives" because of "disasters," making them truly forgotten. Ask yourself in your heart; is your heart at peace? Seek it in reason, is it reasonable? Shanghai has many wealthy families who are skilled in winning profits. They are happy to do good deeds, accumulate virtue, and act with benevolence. They will definitely sincerely support the Disaster Relief Dharma Assembly.

In short, all dharmas are Buddhist dharmas, and we only need to ask whether they can enable people to obtain the supreme enlightenment of great enlightenment. Those who have the mind of Bodhi other than this true enlightenment will definitely make great vows to save sentient beings. Therefore, by extending this equality, we can save the world, abstain from killing, and transcend the dead. We will naturally not only pray for true peace and transcend the souls of the dead, but also strive to educate young people, turn delusion into enlightenment, give money if we have money, give strength if we have strength, and tirelessly engage in all kinds of work that promotes the Dharma and benefits living beings, such as relieving poverty and illness, helping the needy, comforting honorary soldiers, and awarding scholarships to poor students. Make Buddhist disciples have a respected identity in the eyes of the people. This requires organizations like the Buddhist Youth Association to rise up and shoulder heavy responsibilities. In January of the 32nd year, the virtuous Master Xu Yun said at the opening ceremony of the National Disaster Relief Dharma Assembly in Chongqing: "Now people's hearts are not ancient, and they do not know the relationship between politics and education. They do not understand the meaning of governing the body with politics and governing the mind with education at all. Recently, many enlightened people know that the current catastrophe cannot be saved and disasters cannot be eliminated without the unity of politics and education." Indeed, we must use political means to solve national affairs in order to seek current peace; we must also use the truth of Buddhism to educate sentient beings in order to seek permanent peace!

### Mourning Bu Lei

— Chen Wang Yunmo

Alas, Bu Lei, to me you were like a bright lamp, also like a compass needle. Now that the bright lamp has fallen and the compass needle has crashed, what will I, a lone boat facing the ocean, use to continue sailing? You often called yourself "a useless scholar," yet the world viewed you as an assistant and counselor, and regarded you as a "perfect man of the times." Who knew that just a few days of separation would lead to the extinction of your life force, and you would suddenly sacrifice yourself? Alas, how painful! In the years to come, I will put aside my own suffering. Looking back on your life, there are many regrets. Shedding tears and mourning, I truly cannot repay you with a hundred lives.

I lost my father at the age of three, and my mother at the age of thirty. A hundred days later, I returned to you, receiving your deep love, teaching, and guidance in every detail. Your affection was single-minded, your warmth and harmony were admirable, and your relatives and friends envied and admired you more and more. Although the family finances were difficult, you always lived in peace. Now you have left halfway, which is truly a matter of fate. What more can be said? I am left with a life of worry and suffering, spending the most painful years in the world, and I have no interest in life. The reason why I still shamelessly live in the world is that my elder sister is lonely and bitter, and my young children have not yet grown up. I am lingering on my last breath, wanting to comfort your spirit in heaven!

You lost your beloved mother at the age of sixteen, and your father at the age of twenty-five. At the age of thirty, you encountered the disharmony of the zither and se, when you had five children, young siblings, and nearly ten people to support, teach, and guide, all on your own shoulders. The family had many misfortunes, and you became thin and weak. When we first met, I secretly worried about you. You claimed that although your body was weak, your innate constitution was still strong, and you could hope for a long life. The physiognomist had also promised that you could expect to live to seventy, your explanation was sincere and your words were true, but I was still worried that the physiognomist's words were superstitious. Strength and weakness, longevity and short life depend on health preservation. However, because you were born at the wrong time and the times were difficult, things went against your wishes, and you were unable to recover and passed away suddenly! I still remember between the 15th and 16th years of the Republic of China, the leader selected virtuous and talented people, and you were also among them. You once rose to an important position as a scholar, participating in confidential matters. You were deeply afraid of failing and delaying national affairs, and you were troubled and uneasy, always wishing to serve the country with a career as a newspaper reporter. However, due to the leader's courtesy and the earnest persuasion of friends, you could not overly disobey their sincerity and entered the officialdom. Some people congratulated you as a new dignitary, but you were often angry and unhappy, pacing around the room when you returned, without joy all night. After the September 18th Incident, seeing the difficult situation of the country and fearing the collapse of the mansion, you resolutely restrained yourself with the clear teaching that "everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world," dedicating yourself to the country, being vigilant in the evening and working hard in the morning, being self-disciplined and thrifty, hoping to share the leader's worries and strive for the glory of the nation. Whenever relatives and friends came and went, they did not talk about private matters, and those who interfered with private matters were often politely declined. Then you blamed yourself for not being reasonable and losing good relatives and friends. However, public and private affairs could not be balanced, and people and heaven fought, making you depressed and unhappy, and unable to live a day. I understood this situation and never lightly burdened you with matters of siblings, nephews, and nieces.

Ming'er was born in the seventh month of pregnancy. For the first fifteen years after her birth, she was weak and worrying, and her life and death were unpredictable. Fortunately, you took care of her carefully and she finally grew up. I secretly congratulated myself. However, you always worried day and night and could not be peaceful, until you eventually became unable to continue your physical strength and chose to leave this world! Serving you day and night, thirty years of effort, a slight negligence, all flowed to the east, regretting it to the end of the world, regretting what to do! I have examined your organs and found them to be healthy? However, various symptoms were severely gathered, almost becoming a chronic disease. Often, you groaned and twisted, unable to relieve yourself. When there was an important business, you still forced yourself to restrain and hide it, and you appeared as if nothing had happened. Therefore, many people did not know that your illness was deep and dangerous. You had a strong sense of responsibility, thinking that you should always be respectful and respectful in your important task, and you did not have time to consider your own illness, but you did not know that the illness would become more and more incurable. In the past, when my late uncle passed away, my siblings were young and weak, so you abandoned everything and worked hard to teach them, without considering the success of your own career. When I returned, I repeatedly persuaded you. Later, your fourth brother, Shuliang, also gradually realized the rise and fall of the family business, so you began to get rid of family affairs and concentrate on national affairs. You met the country's crisis, and worries and anger intertwined, so you swore to serve the public, doing your best and exhausting your life, not daring to rest. You had already given up your hobbies and cut off your amusements. Although you worked more than ten hours a day, you still felt that your strength was not enough. Alas, people are not iron stones, how can they withstand hard thinking and anxiety, long-term haggardness, and hard work? All day long, it was not enough. You were so selfless, forgetting your body for the country. Now that the overall situation has not been settled, you have already destroyed yourself, selling your ambition to die. Thinking quietly about it, how can it not be said to be a sacrifice of the times?

Friends knew that you were weak and worried about your hard work, and they showed you not to be involved in trivial matters. They did not know that your thoughts were meticulous, your research was thorough, and you drafted your manuscripts, always speaking from the author's point of view and writing from the reader's feelings, exhausting your mind. When dealing with affairs, you must synthesize the name and reality, and when you push the advantages and disadvantages, you often speculate on the bad consequences and plan for the response steps. For this reason, you always regretted that your talent and knowledge were not worthy, and your lonely heart was always there. How could you distinguish yourself from the village fool? In the end, because the world's customs were not ancient and it was difficult to find comrades, you did not dare to hold important positions, failing the leader's recognition and selection and the praise of friends. Silently ending your life, how tragic and painful! I once blamed the heavens in private, since you were given ambition, why not give you health, to help you achieve a little success and achieve your wishes? Now you regret it forever, and you will be buried forever. What is the benefit to the world, and what is there for the people? Alas, how painful!

### Jiangyin Township Head Zhou Zhaoxi Prosecuted for Attempting to Embezzle Rent Rice

[Our Correspondent in Wujin, 17th] Changzhou Provincial Middle School has some school property and farmland located in Dingtiao Township, Jiangyin. Xu Shousheng was entrusted by the school committee to collect rent every year. Last year, Zhou Zhaoxi, the head of the township, sent someone to Changzhou to urge Xu to go to the township to collect rent. Xu was originally wary because of the poor security in the township, but he was happy to go after being urged by Township Head Zhou. With Zhou's assistance, the rent collection was quite effective. Subsequently, Zhou threatened Xu to pay ten shi of rice slips to avoid trouble. There were also more than three shi of rent rice and more than 4,000 jin of grain collected. Just as they were about to be transported, Township Head Zhou again used threatening words to recommend Xu Guangfeng Grain Store in a nearby small town. This year, when they went to collect the grain, they found nothing. Recently, Yang Jiayou, the principal of the school, sent a special envoy to Cheng County to request the county government to severely punish Zhou Zhaoxi, the township head, for intimidating and extorting rent rice and grain.
