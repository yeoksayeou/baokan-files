### Land, Sea, and Air Forces Fight All Night: Communist Troops in Yuepu Annihilated; Communist Troops in Nanhui Advance on Shacheng, National Army Has Rushed to Encircle and Suppress; North of Hongqiao and Nan Yuan Areas Cleared

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Military sources at 9:00 PM on the 16th: Remnant bandits in Yuepu and the vicinity of Xiao Gu Zhai, after being attacked from the flanks and rear by our defending troops since the morning of the 15th, have become turtles in a jar. As of 2:00 PM yesterday, the invading bandits in the Yuepu area have been completely eliminated. The invading bandits in the Xiao Gu Zhai area have also suffered more than half casualties, with the remnants fleeing westward in disarray. At night, the bandits divided into groups and foolishly attacked our army positions in Shizi Lin, Yuepu, Niujiaojian, and Yangxing. The fierce battle lasted all night. Until dawn today, the bandit army failed to cross the boundary. In total, we captured more than 80 bandits, seized more than 30 rifles, 6 light and heavy machine guns, more than 100 rifles and carbines, and 1 submachine gun. More than 300 bandits below the rank of company commander were killed or wounded.

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Military sources at 9:00 AM on the 16th: (1) At 12:00 midnight on the 15th, the bandits' 28th and 22nd Armies exerted all their strength to attack our Yuepu, Yangxing, and other positions. They charged and fought repeatedly more than seven or eight times. However, our defending troops, maintaining the calm spirit of the past few days, gave the invading bandits a head-on blow. The battle continued until dawn on the 16th, when the bandits' offensive was frustrated and they retreated. Inspection of the abandoned corpses revealed about 3,000 bodies. In this battle, our land, sea, and air forces cooperated, exerting tremendous power. According to reliable information, the bandits suffered at least 6,000 casualties in this attack. By noon, the battle had become quiet. Our army will take advantage of the remaining power of the victory and, under favorable circumstances, dispatch strong troops to counterattack, putting the bandits in a state of exhaustion.

(2) Since the bandit 29th Army launched continuous attacks on the Yuepu and Yangxing positions on the evening of the 12th, they have suffered repeated setbacks and serious losses due to the defending troops' brave killing of the enemy, with most of the soldiers wounded or killed. Since the morning of the 15th, they have been retreating without a trace. The bandit unit number is no longer found, and it is judged that they no longer have the ability to fight and are being reorganized and replenished.

(3) Our unit dispatched a large force to attack the bandit stronghold of Li Jia Lou, west of Liu Jia Hang, at noon on the 15th, killing and wounding more than 600 bandits, capturing more than 100 bandits alive, and seizing 25 rifles and machine guns. The bandits were unable to hold out and fled westward. The battle ended in the evening, so there was no battle on the Liu Jia Hang line all night that day.

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Military sources at 12:00 noon on the 16th: Our army in the Yangxing area, with the cooperation of the air force and artillery, launched a mobile surprise attack on the exhausted bandits at 7:00 this morning, achieving great results. A total of 2 heavy machine guns and more than 30 rifles were captured, and one bandit political commissar and more than 40 soldiers were captured alive. We suffered no losses. Also, a small group of bandit troops that had infiltrated Nan Yuan fled westward after our army counterattacked. Currently, there is no trace of bandits around Nan Yuan. Another piece of news: A portion of the bandit army that had fled north from Nanhui advanced on Shacheng at 2:00 PM on the 15th. We have dispatched a strong force to encircle and suppress them.

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] The Shanghai-Song Defense Headquarters announced the battle situation:

(1) The bandits in the Niujiaojian and Yangxing areas launched a fierce attack on our army positions starting at 8:00 PM last night (the 15th). After our frontal troops bravely resisted, an elite unit on the flank was ordered to attack, launching a pincer offensive to fiercely counterattack the invading bandits. The bandit army collapsed and fled across the board, abandoning more than 500 corpses. In this battle, we captured more than 600 bandits, seized 90 rifles, and 9 light machine guns.

(2) Two battalions of the 37th Bandit Army's Guard Regiment launched a probing attack on Qibao at 1:00 this morning. The morale of the defending troops was extremely high, and they concentrated their firepower to bombard the bandits. The bandits suffered heavy casualties. We captured more than 80 bandits. As of press time, the two sides are still in a standoff.

(3) The bandits who fled east along the Qinghu Road were identified as a unit of the 27th Bandit Army. They once advanced on our Nan Yuan (north of Hongqiao Airport) stronghold. After being counterattacked by the local defending troops, they fled in panic, retreating to an area more than ten miles away from Nan Yuan, and there is no movement at the moment.

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] The Air Force Headquarters announced: The Great Shanghai Defense Battle entered its fifth day yesterday (the 16th). The Communist army's fierce offensive against Shanghai has been met with bloody resistance from the land, sea, and air forces for four days. In particular, the air force dispatched sorties day and night to bomb their artillery positions and attack their supply units, causing heavy losses to the Communist army. As a result, since the evening of the 15th, except for the fierce battle for Liu Hang on the outer first line of Great Shanghai, most of the Communist army has been in a state of silence. The military judged that the Communist army was making adjustments to its deployment. Yesterday, Shanghai was hit by strong winds and overcast rain, but the air force still braved the adverse weather to carry out the fifth day of battle to defend Great Shanghai, achieving the following results:

(1) The main force of the air force supported the army in the Liu Hang and Yangxing battles outside the Wusong Fortress area. Yuepu and Yangxing were relatively quiet all day yesterday. The Communist army concentrated its efforts to seize Liu Hang, which shields the Dachang Airport. The air force bombed and killed more than 1,000 Communist troops in the villages of Baziqiao, Gujiazai, and Jianqiao near Liu Hang Town. In Yangxing, two artillery positions and five bunker fortifications were destroyed. In the operation to support Liu Hang Town, Liu Hang Town was once attacked by the Communist army. The air force launched fierce bombings in the sky and annihilated most of them, but hundreds of them stubbornly occupied three buildings in Liu Hang Town and refused to retreat. Incendiary bombs were dropped, directly hitting the buildings and setting them on fire. The army then advanced and wiped them all out.

(2) Ambushed more than 1,000 Communist troops coming from Kunshan and going north to Songjiang, blowing up 5 trucks in Weiting.

(3) Bombed and killed more than 500 Communist troops in the outer fortifications of Zhenru.

(4) Destroyed more than 50 wooden boats of the Communist army landing at Bailonggang in the southeast of Chuansha.

### The National Army Has Extremely Favorable Conditions and Has Confidence in Ensuring Shanghai's Safety; Shanghai-Song Garrison Headquarters Receives Reporters Yesterday

[This Newspaper Dispatch] The Shanghai-Song Garrison Headquarters held a press conference at 3:00 PM on the 16th. Zhang Taixiang, Director of the Political Work Department of the Headquarters, and Deputy Commander Zhou Lixing, analyzed the situation of the defense battle in this city. It is said that the National Army has several favorable conditions for defending Great Shanghai: (1) The defensive fortifications in the four suburbs are extremely strong, and their density is about one-third greater than that of Stalingrad; When Yan Xishan passed through Shanghai, he said that the fortifications in this city were even stronger than those in Taiyuan. (2) The morale of the National Army is high, and its will to fight is firm. One-third of the Communist army are prisoners of war, one-third are new recruits, and only one-third are truly capable of fighting. (3) Public security in the urban area is ensured, and the Garrison Headquarters is determined to suppress riots with force. In addition, this city has convenient transportation, abundant materials, convenient supplies, and sufficient food and fuel for more than half a year. The terrain is favorable for defense with intersecting harbors. The Communist Party's human wave tactics and tunnel warfare tactics are ineffective, so it is believed that there is a certainty of defending the city unless there is an accident. At present, the Communist army on the front line has about six armies, including the 24th, 25th, 26th, 28th, and 29th, which are pressing towards this city from both sides of the Jinghu Road and the Huhang Road. Although their main force has arrived, it has not yet been deployed. According to regular military practice, about a week is needed for attack preparations, so the Communist army's main offensive should be after the 20th of this month. However, the sooner the Communist army launches its general offensive against Shanghai, the greater the mistake it will make. The battle of Shizi Lin and Yuepu is an example. The Communist army attacked wildly and left behind more than 8,000 corpses. Our army's casualties in this battle were only one-twentieth. It is also likened to the Communist army's offensive being like flying a kite, which may be cut off by the National Army at any time, leading to defeat. Furthermore, the waterways in Shanghai are still very smooth, and air transportation is being strengthened, so the supply and transportation of daily necessities for the military and civilians will not be a problem in the future. The current situation is still a prelude, and the main battle has not yet begun. As long as people from all walks of life support the army, there is absolute certainty of ensuring Shanghai's safety.

### Liu Bozhong Talks to Reporters About the Future of the Shanghai-Song Defense Battle

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Yesterday, a reporter visited General Liu Bozhong, Chief of Staff of a high-level command, who received the reporter despite being busy. He said, "The Shanghai-Song Defense Battle is still in the prelude stage. All preparations have been completed long ago and are sufficient to cope with any offensive by the bandits and overcome and crush it." When the reporter asked about strategic issues, he replied with an optimistic attitude, "Strategy is the art of comprehensive application. At present, the close coordination of the land, sea, and air forces is used to deal with the bandit army's one-sided ground offensive, and three-dimensional operations are used to deal with the bandit army's infiltration operations. Moreover, the senior generals responsible for directing the operations this time are all prestigious strategists, and the officers and soldiers of all units are veterans who have fought hundreds of battles and are brave and motivated. Of course, they are confident of defeating the enemy." When the reporter asked about the battle situation in the Yuepu and Yangxing areas, he smiled and said, "What role can a mouse playing around outside an iron cage play? If it sneaks into the iron cage, does the painful consequence need to be said? Please pay attention to the recent situation development and factual performance."

### After the City Falls, Soldiers and Civilians Resist House by House: The Heroic Deeds of Defending Taiyuan; Full Text of Letters and Telegrams from Qi Jingde, Li Ganzhi, and Yan Xishan

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th] Qi Jingde, Director of Inspection of the Shanxi Provincial Government, telegraphed Deputy Director Jia of the Executive Yuan from Xi'an, forwarding a telegram from Director Yan on the 9th, stating: "When the enemy launched the seventh general offensive against Taiyuan on April 9, in addition to the original force of more than 300,000, they also transferred more than 100,000 elite troops from Hebei and Henan, equipped with particularly strong artillery, and used a large amount of poison gas, resulting in particularly heavy casualties among our soldiers and civilians. Soldiers and civilians resisted house by house. Our heroic soldiers and civilians suffered heavy casualties, and almost all houses were destroyed, making it difficult for the Communist bandits to find complete walls to post notices after entering the city. Except for Sun Chu, Wang Jingguo, Xue Yuxiang, and Ying Shaozhi, the other senior civil and military officials were either captured or committed suicide. The details are not yet known when leaving the city. However, it is known for certain that Liang Huazhi, Acting Chairman of the Provincial Government Committee, and Xu Feng, Chief of the Department; Wu Fuxi, Captain of the Team, and other 120 people collectively took poison and heroically sacrificed themselves after the city fell on the 25th, and set themselves on fire. As of the 26th, many fortifications outside the city continued to resist." Director Yan also received a letter from Li Ganzhi, Administrative Commissioner of the Seventh District, from Xi'an on May 9, describing the final battle in Taiyuan, stating: On May 4, Zhang Kehan, Deputy County Magistrate of Yangqu, escaped and arrived in Shaanxi. He gave a detailed account of our Taiyuan Defense Battle. In addition to instructing the comrade to report in writing, I hereby list the details I have learned: (1) The main force of the bandit army attacking our Taiyuan was about 400,000 people from the three units of Peng Dehuai, Nie Rongzhen, and Xu Xiangqian, and the stretcher team and people carrying coffins were also about 300,000. Their commander was Peng Dehuai. (2) The weapons used by the bandit army included 30 to 40 artillery pieces of various sizes, countless light and heavy machine guns, and most importantly, 15 cm howitzers, poison gas, and tear gas. (3) The bandits launched their offensive against Taiyuan on April 9. The fierce battle lasted until the 19th. The bandits used "human waves," "fire seas," and "gap penetration" tactics, attacking our suburban strongholds on one side and attacking the city fiercely on the other. The fighting was extremely fierce. By the 20th, the bandits were close to the outer moat of the city, and the fighting around the city was unprecedentedly fierce. At that time, the bandit artillery fired at the city with "cold hail" tactics, dropping no less than 50,000 to 60,000 shells every day, incinerating most of our city's fortifications and all buildings. It was difficult for our reserve troops in the city to move. The fighting continued until the 21st and 22nd, when two sections of the city wall near Dabeiguan were breached by the bandits using human wave and fire sea tactics. However, our defending troops bravely resisted, repelled the enemy, and patched up the breaches. At about 5:00 AM on the 24th, a breach was blown open by artillery fire at the Xishu fire area outside the southwest gate of the city. The bandits rushed into the city, and street fighting began. By the morning of the 25th, our army had suffered heavy casualties, and the city fell into the hands of the bandits. The suburban strongholds were not occupied by the bandits until the morning of the 26th. (4) This Taiyuan Defense Battle annihilated about 200,000 bandits, which was truly due to the fact that our heroic officers and soldiers were able to follow your instructions to "defend every inch of land" and "fight for every house," striving hard and making sacrifices. Moreover, our people were able to display a resolute anti-Communist spirit, assisting the army in combat, delivering tea and meals to the officers and soldiers under the rain of bullets, carrying the wounded, building fortifications, and extinguishing fires, demonstrating great power. (5) In this defense battle, in addition to the alarming number of casualties among our officers and soldiers, about 50,000 of our people were killed or wounded. Ninety percent of the public and private buildings in the city have been reduced to ashes. Streets such as Liuxiang, Mao'erxiang, and Hongshipailou have almost no complete houses, only rubble, a desolate sight. (6) Liang Huazhi, Xu Duan, Yin Zundang, Lan Feng, Wu Fuxi, and more than 120 others, upon hearing that the bandits had broken into the city, collectively sacrificed themselves heroically at Liang's mansion (the Special Police and Gendarmerie Command Post). It was also heard that after Liang sacrificed himself, his mansion had become a sea of fire, fulfilling the instruction to make sure that no corpse would be seen by the enemy. (7) Sun, Wang, Xue, and Wu were all captured by the bandits. The bandits insulted Wang in every way, and his face was beaten black and blue. When he was escorted to Yuci, several bandit soldiers lifted Wang from the ground and threw him onto the car, a very miserable sight."

### Legislative Yuan Committee Reviews the Simplification of County-Level Organizations

### Land Reform in Southwestern Fujian Achieves Good Results After Implementation; Increased Agricultural Income and Improved Social Order

[United States News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th] Southwestern Fujian has recorded the acceptance of economic assistance from the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction and the implementation of land reform and rural reconstruction plans. This is an example of using US dollars to help Chinese farmers practice self-help.

The Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction was established in accordance with the China Aid Act of 1948 to assist the rural areas of China in implementing reconstruction plans. The funds to continue this plan are included in the funds for extending economic aid to China, which Congress approved last month. The new bill allows the Economic Cooperation Administration and the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction to use $54,000,000 until February 1, 1950, according to the above funds, which are the funds that were originally under the China Aid Act but have not yet been used.

The Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction estimates that the commission will receive approximately $15,000,000 of the total amount to assist in the implementation of local rural reconstruction plans in the coming year.

Of this amount, $95,926 has been allocated to projects in Fujian to transfer land ownership to those who actually cultivate it, complete four irrigation projects to increase agricultural production, and establish a rural credit loan. The funds will be allocated as follows: $39,000 to implement land reform in six districts of southwestern Fujian, $36,926 to complete four irrigation projects in the Longyan district, and $20,000 as credit loans to farmers in Longyan. To date, the local authorities in the district have received $20,000.

The $39,000 for land reform will assist local authorities in Shanghang, Yongding, Wuping, Liancheng, Zhangping, and Changting to acquire land for distribution to landless farmers. The funds will be used to assist local governments in conducting necessary land surveys to determine the basis for land distribution. The land is acquired by the government in accordance with the power of eminent domain and transferred to farmers after they pay 250 percent of the average of the land rent for the most recent three years.

The $36,926 allocated by the commission for irrigating Longyan will help complete the two projects currently underway in Tanghe, Denggang, Xiaoyang, and Guangba (transliteration). Farmers will be able to repay the funds after the irrigation facilities are expanded and grain harvests increase. These repaid funds will be used to establish a revolving fund to implement other projects and promote the interests of farmers in the area.

The $20,000 rural credit loan will be used to purchase fertilizer, water buffalo, and provide relief to farmers suffering from high-interest loans (the commission funds are grants and do not bear interest). The commission funds will also be used to purchase improved seeds, insecticides, and plant protectants, as well as better breeds of pigs. Local government agencies in Longyan will also raise an equal amount of funds to make a total of $40,000. The land reform plan currently being implemented in Longyan has become a model that can be followed by projects launched by the commission in nearby areas. In Longyan, only actual cultivators may be allocated land, with the exception of landowners who are urgently dependent on the land for their livelihoods, such as widows or the elderly. They may temporarily retain their land ownership until their need for income no longer exists, at which time the land will be transferred to tenants. The government uses the power of eminent domain to acquire land and compensate the owners according to the land value.

The land is allocated according to the number of people in the family. Families of four or fewer can receive 12 to 20 mu, and families with more than four people can receive 25 percent more land for each person exceeding four (the calculation standard is that each mu can produce one dan of brown rice per year). Cultivators may not acquire more land by purchase in the future.

Longyan's land reform plan is sufficient to achieve one of the main goals of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, that is, the reconstruction obtained from this plan will belong to the people rather than to a few. Longyan has a population of approximately 140,000 people, of whom 120,000 are farmers.

The survey of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction shows that this plan has already produced significant benefits in improving living conditions. Agricultural income has increased, and rural capital has also increased. In short, farmers now have enough food to eat, which was not the case in the past. Most farmers can now wear modern clothes, whereas in the past, most of them wore rags. Most of the dilapidated houses have now been replaced with new or repaired houses, and it is estimated that the overall standard of living has increased by 20 percent.

Agricultural income has also increased by a percentage equivalent to the above.

Investigators from the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction also reported that order in the area has greatly improved, there are no beggars in the area, there are very few cases of theft, and land disputes in towns, which previously accounted for 43 percent of lawsuits, now account for only 8 percent.

Furthermore, farmers are proud to be able to cultivate their own land, so communism has no persuasive effect. The survey results show that there is no Communist Party activity in the area—although the Communist Party is very active in the surrounding areas. Moreover, the only enemies of the plan are the Labour Party members active on the Guangdong border.

### Bai Chongxi Presides Over Changsha Command Post: Actively Completing New Deployments: Planned Withdrawal from Wuhan Completed

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 16th] A spokesman for the Central China Commander-in-Chief's Office said: Due to strategic considerations, the Supreme Command of Central China has ordered the Wuhan garrison to make a planned withdrawal from the three towns of Wuhan, a military stronghold in Central China. General Bai Chongxi, Chief of the Central China Military and Political Affairs, flew from Guangzhou to Wuhan on the 13th of this month to personally supervise the withdrawal. By the 15th, all of our defending troops and all military supplies had been proactively withdrawn from Wuhan according to plan. The few defensive troops in Hankou also crossed the river yesterday to reach Wuchang and continue moving south. Only a small number of unusable broken tanks, armored vehicles, and heavy-duty vehicles, totaling about sixty, remained there.

### The Truth About Peace in Beiping (Continued from Yesterday)

He even pretended not to have heard of the name "Fu Yisheng," insisting that "Chuan" be written as "Yi." He repeatedly emphasized that the reason they had not entered the city yet was not because they could not capture it, but because they feared destroying this ancient cultural capital. He further emphasized that everyone should recognize that it was not Fu Zuoyi who protected the city of Beiping, but the city of Beiping that protected Fu Zuoyi. If he remained obstinate, then the responsibility for destroying Beiping would not be placed on the account of the Communist army. He started by saying: To negotiate peace, you must first agree to the eight conditions proposed by Chairman Mao, otherwise there is no point in talking. After the representatives heard his high opinion, He Siyuan was the first to agree to 9.9 of the eight conditions, believing that there were no problems with the others, except that Fu's name should be removed from the list of war criminals. Other representatives believed that he had agreed too readily, saying that we are people's representatives, and our task is only to open the door to peace. As for the conditions, we hope that the two sides will talk directly. Several times the conclusion was to ask the two sides to negotiate directly. They stayed overnight and returned to the city the next afternoon, having been treated to two extremely rich banquets, accompanied by the famous Hai Dian Ren He Zhan Lotus White wine. The representatives had not tasted meat for more than a month in the city, and they were all happy to overeat. Later, it was rumored that someone got drunk, but that was not the case. Before returning to the city, the Communist side's condition was that the negotiations should not be revealed in the newspapers, so after returning to the city, all ten representatives kept their mouths shut, and their daily task was to avoid journalists. Therefore, very few people know the details mentioned above.

As for the military's peace negotiations, Mr. Fu always kept his mouth shut. Even his close aides, the Hebei Chairman Chu Qingbo and the Deputy Secretary-General of the Pacification Headquarters, often complained that he did not reveal a single word. One can imagine how others felt. From various clues after the fact, it seems that Mr. Fu's private representatives were Deng, Guo Zongfen, Zhou Beifeng, Qin Fengchuan, and Cui Zaizhi. Before the peace treaty was signed, they repeatedly met with Lin Biao, Ye Jianying, Nie Rongzhen, etc., and finally signed an agreement of twenty-five articles on January 22, but only thirteen articles were published in the newspaper.

(6) One Day of Jubilation

The people of Beiping have experienced vicissitudes of life and suffered many sorrows. Their worldliness is unparalleled. Therefore, apart from being forced to perform genuine jubilation like American children, it is difficult to encounter. I am from Lugouqiao, very close to Beiping. In my memory, there have only been three events that can be called city-wide jubilation. The first time was on December 25, 1936, when Chairman Chiang Kai-shek escaped from Xi'an. At that time, the people of Beiping had been bullied by Japan for more than forty years since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95. Especially after the September 18 Incident, the East Hebei Autonomous Anti-Communist Council was right in front of them, and the Japanese and Korean hooligans made trouble unreasonably, oppressing the people to the point of suffocation. Their only hope was to resist Japan, but the central force of resistance against Japan, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, was in distress. What other hope was there! After thirteen days of depression, they suddenly heard that he had escaped from danger. How could they not rejoice? This was the first time. The second time was the victory in 1945. When the Anti-Japanese War broke out, Beiping was the first to fall. After eight years of trampling by the invaders, once the country won victory, people were truly overjoyed. This was the second time. The third time was this year's January 23. Beiping had been besieged for forty days since December 14 of last year. During these forty days, although the people of Beiping remained calm and order was maintained, it was like the tranquility of a person about to die. What was the use of being anxious? Everyone already knew the example of Xinbao'an. If tens of thousands of shells were fired again, Beiping would inevitably follow in the footsteps of Xinbao'an. When humanity reaches its most dangerous moment, it instinctively seeks not to die. Now that the peace treaty has been signed on January 22, at least they can avoid dying for the time being. It is just like a person who has escaped death. What words can be used to describe their jubilation? Moreover, having escaped death, they can also celebrate the New Year in peace. What could be more joyful than this? On that day, prices plummeted, even more drastically than in the year of victory. The price of silver dollars the previous day was 360 yuan in gold certificates, but that day it fell to 180. Pork, which originally sold for four catties of silver dollars on the spot, now sold for four catties for one silver dollar. All other prices dropped by at least half. Escaping death and celebrating a peaceful New Year, relieving the pressure of prices, was truly like having both blessings and longevity. I don't think even a writer like me can describe the happy mood of the people of Beiping that day.

But the most tragic thing is that good times don't last long, and feasts are hard to repeat. The people of Beiping must still have committed grave sins, and their great calamity has not yet been fulfilled. The day of jubilation only lasted for one day. It only lasted for one day, and on the 24th, things went wrong. Perhaps after excessive jubilation, people regained some reason and thought that the thirteen articles of peace were not peace but surrender. As a result, prices rose again, and they rose very quickly. The silver dollar is the standard of prices. On the 24th, it rose to 280, on the 25th, it rose back to 360, and on the 26th, it rose to 480, which was more expensive than during the siege. With such a large increase, it had risen to over 1,000 by February 1. In addition, social order was greatly disrupted, and at least five or six robberies occurred every day. Illusions were persuaded by reality, and people all raised their heads again. But people always place their hopes on the future. If this year is not good, they hope that luck will change next year. If luck is not good, they hope to get rich when they have nasal luck. If this life is not good, they hope to go to heaven in the next life. If this government is not good, they hope that the next government will be perfect, and they always imagine the future or the environment they have experienced as perfect. Optimists say that this is a normal phenomenon during the transition between two regimes, and things will be better after the joint institutions are established on February 1 and the Liberation Army enters the city. But what is the reality? Let's see! (To be continued)

### Visiting the Luodian Front Line

— Zhao He

The area from Jiading northwards to Baoshan in the east is the throat of Shanghai, a vital strategic location. It is said that the National Army guarding this area is a powerful unit that has shown its prowess on weak battlefields.

Yesterday morning at 9 AM, the reporter took a jeep to visit the Luodian front line. Along the way, trenches crisscrossed and bunkers were scattered everywhere. The inspections along the way were extremely strict, almost every five steps there was a post, and every ten steps there was a sentry. After multiple interrogations, the reporter finally arrived at Luodian at 11 AM. When inquiring about the address of the commanding officer of the ×× unit responsible for this defense line from armed comrades, everyone replied in unison, "I don't know!" This made the reporter very embarrassed. Later, a plainclothes person (who later turned out to be a political worker of the unit) came forward, clarified everything to the reporter, and after several turns, finally met the Ma Regiment Commander of the unit. Upon meeting, the Regiment Commander shook hands warmly and repeatedly said: "Welcome!" "But it's not easy for you to come to this place!" The reporter then asked the soldiers on the street if they belonged to his unit, and why they all replied "I don't know" when asked about the address of the commanding officer. Mr. Ma smiled and said: "This is the secret to our 'secrecy'! When you ask this and that on the street, we already know. The plainclothes personnel are sent from here, and the common people will report to this unit whenever they see unfamiliar faces. You have a very good opportunity today, and I have good news to tell you. Now, let Liu, the cadre, talk to you in the next room."

The reporter then followed Cadre Liu to another room to chat. Cadre Liu told many facts that he considered unremarkable but were surprising to the reporter. He said: "The political workers of this unit have a very high status and heavy responsibilities. They are very strict in organizing and training the people, and the education of the soldiers is also extremely thorough. On the 6th of this month, when our 6th Battalion was ordered to go to the Liuhe area for guerrilla warfare, because it was necessary to go to the Fuqiao area to scout the terrain and bandit situation, the deputy instructor of the team, Shi Wenjie, volunteered to disguise himself and go with a comrade. When they arrived at Liuliqiao in Qianjin Township and walked about a mile or so towards Fuqiao, many bandit soldiers suddenly rushed out of the wheat field. When they were escorting the two of them to the bandit's den, our elusive brothers intercepted the bandits at this time. Shi Wenjie ran back to the original formation during the gunfire between the two sides. The bandits could not withstand our firepower and fled in all directions. Our brave brothers captured sixteen bandits alive and returned victoriously." He continued: "Because we are very serious about rectifying military discipline, in addition to plainclothes political workers patrolling at all times, we also reward the people for reporting. Moreover, because we strictly adhere to integrity with the people, the assistance we receive from the people is really too great. If we can make good use of the people's power in future suppression work, it will definitely accelerate the arrival of our victory!"

While the reporter was chatting with Cadre Liu, the situation in the Regiment Commander's office next door seemed very tense and excited. The phone rang constantly, and the Regiment Commander's instructions, "Be vigilant!" "Wipe them out quickly!" "Capture them alive as much as possible!..." "Good! Good!" came out of the Regiment Commander's office from time to time. The reporter's emotions also became tense.

After about an hour, a messenger asked the reporter to go to the Regiment Commander's office. The Regiment Commander had a smile on his face and told the reporter in an excited tone about the battle of the 3rd Company of the Regiment's surprise attack on the Liduqiao north of Jiading today: "The 86th Division of the Communist 28th Army came from the Zhitang area on the 6th, trying to harass Jiading and destroy the Shanghai-Taihang Highway. Its search company was stationed in Liduqiao. This Regiment gave it close surveillance, waiting for an opportunity to attack. The bandit army was extremely alert, making it difficult to understand our deployment. They had not taken action for a long time. This Regiment realized that the bandits were cautious in guarding at night but careless during the day. It sent two platoons of the 3rd Company and two squads of the 2nd Company, under the unified command of Han Guojun, the Company Commander of the 3rd Company, to set off at dawn today. One platoon in plain clothes was in front, and the rest followed, rushing towards Liduqiao.

"Meng Jilan, a private first class of the 3rd Company, crawled forward for about a mile through the wheat field to the vicinity of the bridgehead. He saw the bandit sentry pacing back and forth in a figure-eight pattern at the bridgehead, completely unaware. Taking advantage of when he turned around, he jumped up from the field without being noticed and tightly hugged the bandit sentry. Under Sergeant Liu Zhiqing, the squad leader, immediately rushed forward and disarmed the bandit's gun. At that time, the village was still indifferent. He was forced to reveal the bandit's situation and immediately reported to the company commander and platoon leader to quickly bring the team forward. Meng Xiulan handed the bandit sentry over to Liu Zhiqing to guard, and personally entered the village with a submachine gun. He found more than a dozen bandits eating in the courtyard next door, and immediately shot and killed three bandits. Turning around the corner of the house, he finished off another one. At this time, Du Zhen, the second lieutenant platoon leader of the 2nd Company, had led two squads of brothers to rush into Liduqiao at lightning speed. The bandit unit suspected that soldiers had fallen from the sky, and they were flustered and at a loss, and fled north in panic. It is estimated that the bandits left behind eighteen bodies, captured more than ten bandits, seized three rifles, one pistol, two horses, and one telegraph machine, etc." Finally, the Regiment Commander told the reporter in a firm tone: "This raid was just to give the brothers a chance to practice bandit suppression skills, and it was also a small punishment for the Communist bandits. Bigger victories are still to be won in the future. I sincerely welcome comrades from the press to come and watch the battle and convey the heroic spirit of our brothers to the compatriots of the whole country. I also hope to bring the warmth of the compatriots in the rear to the front line!"

After bidding farewell to the Ma Regiment Commander, the reporter returned in a jeep.

### U.S. Secretary of State Acheson is Studying Strategies for a Diplomatic Showdown with the Soviet Union: Believes Europe Still Feels the Threat of Aggression: Representatives of the Three Powers Continue Secret Talks

[United Press, Washington, 16th] Secretary of State Acheson worked overtime over the weekend to study future strategies for a diplomatic showdown with the Soviet Union. Acheson publicly warned that Soviet aggression still looms over the European continent. This warning is Acheson's main topic in preparation for the four-power foreign ministers' meeting in Paris on the 23rd of this month, at which time Acheson will face Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky in an attempt to prove whether the Soviet Union's lifting of the Berlin blockade has truly changed its attitude. Acheson is scheduled to depart for Paris over the weekend, where he will meet with British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Schuman.

[Reuters, Paris, 16th] The representatives of the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, namely Jessup of the United States, Colville of the United Kingdom, and Ballot of France, will hold their second meeting here on the 16th to discuss unifying the policies of the three powers in the foreign ministers' meeting. The representatives of the three countries held their first meeting yesterday and agreed that everything discussed in the meeting would not be announced to the outside world, but each would submit a report to their respective foreign ministers. The difficult points that arise in the discussion will also be decided by the foreign ministers of the three countries, such as the question of whether the Soviet Union should participate in the control of the Ruhr, on which the opinions of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have not yet converged. According to observers, the Soviet Union is also deeply afraid of encountering a firm front from the Western three powers at this foreign ministers' meeting, as evidenced by the words of French Communist leader Thorez. Thorez said that the Western three powers would use the "fait accompli" in Germany to deal with the Soviet Union.

[Reuters, New Bedford, Guangzhou, 15th] Maddox, President of the Council on Foreign Relations, said here today that although the Berlin blockade has been lifted, it has not eliminated the Soviet Union's threat of aggression. The threat of aggression can only be eliminated when the Soviet Union proves by its policies and actions that it has permanently abandoned all forms of aggression and cooperates with the United Nations. He pointed out the Soviet Union's uncooperative attitude in the United Nations, the Soviet Union's coercion of Iran, Turkey, and Greece, and the Communist Party's seizure of power in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. He also said that fortunately, the United States and the United Nations took timely and forceful action to prevent the three countries, including Iran, from being invaded, and to prevent Moscow's communism from invading Central and Western Europe. This is not a dispute between the United States and the Soviet Union, but a problem between the free nations of the world who love peace and any aggressor.

### Gromyko Leads Entourage: Departs from the United States to Return to Moscow: Will Stay Briefly While Passing Through Paris

[Associated Press, New York, 15th] Gromyko and his eleven-member Soviet entourage departed by plane for Moscow today, carrying 1,522 pounds of luggage and a large quantity of champagne and chicken stewed in wine.

[United Press, New York, 16th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko flew to Paris today. Before leaving, he told reporters: "If the people of the United States and the Soviet Union are willing, they can cooperate." When reporters asked whether the lifting of the Berlin blockade could ease the tensions between the East and West, Gromyko replied: "The future can decide. We must work for peace."

Gromyko is the chief representative of the Soviet Union to the United Nations. This time, he returned to his country without waiting for the end of the General Assembly. It is said that he has a certain mission. It is said that he only plans to stay in Paris for one or two days and does not plan to stay until the four-power foreign ministers' meeting on May 23. The duties of the Soviet representative to the United Nations are now being handled by Deputy Minister Malik.

### UN General Assembly: Debates the Spanish Question: Poland Accuses U.S. Policy

[United Press, New York, 16th] The United Nations General Assembly will hold an extra meeting today to vote on the question of restoring diplomatic relations with the Franco regime in Spain. The General Assembly was originally scheduled to close on the 14th, but the session has been extended due to heated debates over the Spanish question and colonial issues.

[This Newspaper] New York, 16th Broadcast: Flushing News, when the United Nations held a final debate on the Franco question on the 16th, Polish representative Katz Sozai criticized Acheson's anti-Franco statement last week as "merely lip service to democracy." He pointed out that the United States has a secret military alliance with Franco.

### British Authorities Illegally Arrest a Person on a Polish Ship: Poland Lodges a Protest

Claiming It Violates Polish Sovereignty and the National Flag

[Reuters, London, 15th] The Polish Embassy issued a statement today stating that the British authorities sent police to board the Polish ship "Batory" yesterday to arrest Communist leader Eisler, which violated Poland's sovereignty, national flag, and the internationally recognized legal order and principles of human rights. Embassy officials also said: The Polish government's protest letter on this matter will be submitted to the British Foreign Office on the 16th. At the same time, a spokesman for the British Foreign Office stated that since the Polish ship "Batory" was docked within British territorial waters, it was under British jurisdiction. Therefore, Britain has the right to arrest any criminal. Furthermore, Eisler's arrest does not affect the question of whether he should be extradited. This question will be decided by the court to see if there are sufficient reasons to invoke the extradition treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States. At the same time, the "German Democratic British Committee" here has hired London's famous lawyer Moore to defend Eisler. The committee also issued a statement saying that the committee's concern for Eisler is not because Eisler is German, but because he is a German refugee who is anti-Nazi. Warsaw Radio's broadcast today referred to Eisler's arrest as a brutal kidnapping by Scotland Yard personnel.

### British Ambassador to the Soviet Union: Peterson Returns Home

Successor Has Not Yet Been Announced

[United Press, London, 16th] British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Peterson returned here from Moscow on the 15th. Mr. Peterson has served in the diplomatic service for 35 years and has been Ambassador to the Soviet Union for three years. He is now retiring, and who will succeed him has not yet been announced.

### European Socialist Congress Opens in the Netherlands

Nearly 100 Representatives from 17 Countries Attend

[Reuters, Baarn, Netherlands, 15th] Nearly one hundred representatives from seventeen countries began a three-day International Socialist Congress here today. Dutch Socialist leader Nittelss delivered the opening address, emphasizing that war will never occur during the brave vigilance of international socialism. At the last Socialist Congress, the Italian leftist Socialist leader Nanni was suspended due to his cooperation with the Communist Party, and it is generally expected that this session will definitively revoke Nanni's eligibility to attend. Italian Socialist right-wing leader Saragat is still attending this session as usual. It is also reported that past congresses only discussed national issues, while this session will also cover international events, such as the organization of a unified Europe, international control of industry, and joint assistance to free countries of the world.

[Agence France-Presse, The Hague, 16th] The European Socialist Congress today passed a proposal advocating that the major industries of Europe should all be publicly owned. This should be one of the five basic principles governing a unified European economy. The other four principles are: (1) Establishing a European Monetary Fund to prepare for the implementation of a unified European currency. (2) Establishing a cooperative purchasing agency to establish long-term contracts for the purchase of food and raw materials. (3) Adjusting the sale of raw materials. (4) Establishing an investment agency among European countries. The Congress also passed a proposal expressing disappointment at the Italian Socialist Party's decision to cooperate with the Communist Party, and calling on the Italian Socialist Party to become a separate Socialist Party and not to have any connection with the Communist Party or the Cominform.

### Wallace's National Speech Advocates Peace Movement

Strongly Opposes the Atlantic Pact

[United Press, Denver, Colorado, 15th] Progressive Party leader Wallace gave a nationwide speech on the peace movement, advising the people tonight to rise up and oppose the North Atlantic Treaty. Wallace stated, "Last night, we launched a revolutionary movement in Los Angeles, in the American West, to resist the greatest oppressor, the North Atlantic Treaty. Now, we hope that the people of Denver will respond and launch a similar revolutionary movement in the Rocky Mountains. I must warn you that this revolutionary movement, like all revolutionary movements, will require some sacrifice. But if you want greater security, you must overthrow this treaty. If money is spent to create insecurity in the world with military force and weapons, there will be no room for social security. If money is spent to build barracks, there will be no room for families." Wallace also stated at a press conference that he hoped the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference could establish an agreement to replace the Yalta and Potsdam agreements. The Potsdam and Yalta conferences produced many misunderstandings. If the four representatives have the interests of the people at heart, they should be able to reach an agreement without sacrificing the security of any country. The lifting of the Berlin blockade is a good sign.

### North Atlantic Security Treaty: Spain and West Germany Excluded; Acheson to Explain to Congress

[United Press, Washington, 15th] Secretary of State Acheson will explain to Congress this week that Spain or West Germany have no place in the North Atlantic Treaty. Acheson will state this opinion in a memorandum from the State Department, reiterating statements he has made several times before, in response to questions raised by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee regarding the Atlantic Treaty. Acheson will generally explain that while the inclusion of Spain and Germany in the anti-communist alliance has strategic value from a military perspective, political considerations make this path impossible to follow.

It is expected that Acheson's memorandum will be released at the end of this week, after he meets with the Appropriations Subcommittee to discuss Spain and China, and with the Foreign Relations Committee to discuss US policy towards Germany. Acheson's meetings with the Appropriations and Foreign Relations Committees will be his last appearance before Congress before he departs for Paris on Thursday to attend the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Acheson has been under strong pressure in Congress to restore full diplomatic relations with Spain, but the requirements for the Franco regime are too dictatorial to be met. Unless Acheson makes further amendments, this memorandum will further state that Franco cannot maintain close and friendly relations with the other signatories of the treaty. Although West Germany will contribute to the security of Western Europe, it is impossible for other countries to bring Germany into the treaty.

Other points that Acheson will emphatically state are as follows: (1) The Atlantic Committee and the Defense Committee established by the Atlantic Treaty will draft mutually coordinated armament production and defense procedures, but without any obligation to use American troops in Europe. (2) If Congress passes a bill to supply Europe with military equipment, the United States will control the distribution of all military equipment supplied by the US to the signatories of the treaty. US military equipment will be shipped according to the cooperative plans formulated by the signatories of the treaty. No equipment may be diverted for use in colonial wars, such as the conflict in Indonesia with the Netherlands and the stalemate in Vietnam with France. (3) Regardless of the outcome of the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the US Senate must ratify the Atlantic Treaty to show the Soviet Union that the United States intends to remain calm and firm. Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally hopes to conclude hearing opinions on the treaty on Wednesday, but Connally cannot determine when the treaty will be submitted for approval. Connally wants to issue a favorable report on this treaty so that Acheson's position will be strengthened by the support of the Foreign Relations Committee when he attends the Paris Conference.

### East Germany Holds General Election: "Withdraw Occupation Forces and Unify Germany" as Slogan; USSR Plans to Strengthen its Position at Foreign Ministers' Conference

[United Press, Berlin, 15th] East German Communist leaders today called on the people to vote on the 15th and 16th to create a so-called German People's Congress. At least ten million of East Germany's eighteen million people will cast ballots. The East German People's Congress proposes to conclude a final peace treaty, quickly withdraw all occupation forces, and unify the entire German territory, which is quite appealing to German nationalism.

[United Press, Berlin, 15th] The German people in the Soviet occupation zone are conducting a general election under Soviet control on the 15th, the purpose of which is obviously to strengthen the Soviet Union's bargaining position at the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Voters can only cast a yes or no vote for the official "People's Council" list of 1,525 Communist and pro-Soviet candidates, with no other alternative candidates. The "People's Council" will approve the constitution drafted by the German Communist Party. Western political observers believe that Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky will clearly argue at the Four-Power Conference that the "People's Council" and the constitution it approves represent the true public opinion of all of Germany, and will denounce the constitution approved by the Bonn Constitutional Assembly as being dictated by Western imperialists. Anti-communists denounce this election as a "Hitler-style" election and urge every East German voter to cast a no vote "if they must vote for personal safety." Although West Germany prohibits this election, the Communist United Front has nominated 5,000 people as candidates for the three occupation zones of West Germany and the western sector of Berlin, and has listed the names of the candidates. The Communist propaganda machine calls on Germans to vote "yes so that your voice can be heard in Paris."

### Most Japanese Ordnance Factories and Shipyards Can Be Retained

US Pacific Fleet Commander to Visit Japan

[Reuters, Tokyo, 15th] The Japan Cooperative News Agency stated that after the United States decided last week to stop removing reparations materials from Japan, Japan can retain 38 shipyards, capable of building 800,000 tons of ships annually. About one-third of these shipyards have already been designated for dismantling as reparations. Also, most of the 96 government-owned ordnance factories are expected to be retained.

[United Press, Tokyo, 16th] Naval officials announced that Admiral Radford, Commander of the US Pacific Fleet, will arrive in Tokyo on the 27th to meet with Vice Admiral Bogk, Commander of the Far East Naval Forces. During his visit, Radford will inspect the Yokosuka Naval Base and the main US naval facilities in Japan.

### South Korean Foreign Minister Advocates Conclusion of Pacific Pact

Rejects Nehru's Remarks

[United Press, Seoul, 16th] South Korean Foreign Minister Park Heon-young on the 16th refuted Indian Prime Minister Nehru's statement that "it is practically impossible to conclude a Pacific Security Pact until stability is achieved among Asian countries." Park stated: "We need a Pacific Pact precisely because Asian countries are currently unstable. If the Asian situation were safe and peaceful, there would be no need for a Pacific Pact." "We should call on the current governments of all Asian countries to negotiate. Negotiation does not mean making definite obligations, but the issue of a Pacific Pact should be raised and clarified now." He continued: "The Pacific is now nothing more than a central swamp. All South American countries face the Pacific, and Mexico, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Japan should also take action on the Pacific Pact."

### Iran Demands Debt from USSR

[Reuters, Tehran, 15th] Iranian Foreign Minister Haikmat declared today that Iran has formally requested the Soviet Union to repay 12 tons of gold and nearly $9 million in debt owed to Iran since World War II. This is the cost of wartime Iranian supplies and services to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has never explained its reasons for refusing payment. Haikmat also stated that this attitude of the Soviet Union makes it impossible to conclude a trade agreement between the two countries.

### New Discoveries in the Heavens Using the Largest Telescope

[United Press, New York, 15th] The American magazine "Collier's" published several photos taken by the Palomar Mountain Observatory using the world's largest telescope. One photo shows a haze in a distant star region, the light from which began to be emitted to Earth from around 1500 BC at a speed of 186,000 miles per second. Another photo, a galaxy the size of the Milky Way, is also a major discovery, but its distance is not mentioned. This telescope weighs 500 tons and has a diameter of 200 inches. Its focusing power is so great that it can capture a piece of sky as small as the head of a needle. Astronomers hope that it will help them answer countless mysteries about the universe, such as whether the universe is exploding or flying apart. Palomar Mountain astronomers used a 48-inch camera to capture stars 300 million light-years away and then repeatedly enlarged the photos.

### Chinese Firecrackers Sold to America

For Celebrating American Independence Day

[United Press, Seattle, 16th] There is enough gunfire in China, so firecrackers can be exported as much as possible. The American cargo ship "American Mail" arrived here today carrying 99 tons of Chinese firecrackers for use in celebrations on American Independence Day on July 4.

### "War on Poverty": British Labour Party's Overseas Policy Goal

An extremely important section of the policy statement issued by the British Labour Party for the next general election concerns overseas—foreign, Commonwealth and colonial—policy, entitled "Vanguard of World Progress." This section expresses Labour's current views and future plans and hopes in broad principles and certain details.

If the Labour government is re-elected, it will pursue three supreme goals overseas: (1) Peace, enabling the United Nations Organization to achieve the lofty goals for which it was founded; (2) British economic independence, with Britain continuing to lead other countries towards higher living standards and "bolder and freer opportunities for social development"; (3) "An unremitting battle against the age-old scourge of poverty everywhere." These three goals are interrelated.

Under the Labour government, Britain is proving that planning and democracy are not incompatible, and that the parliamentary system can also act quickly to change power relations in society while still preserving freedom of speech and association and protecting dissent.

This section of the declaration lists how the Soviet Union and its satellite states despise cooperation, thus creating a war terror and harming the peaceful wishes of all people. The Soviet Union has refused large-scale exchanges of teachers and students, consistently ignored or undermined the Potsdam Agreement, refused to sign a Four-Power Treaty to prevent Germany's resurgence, rejected American aid to Europe, obstructed, imprisoned, and destroyed socialists who care about the people's livelihood, and has shown that it only respects Western democratic covenants when they are strongly protected and bravely defended.

Britain cannot restore the reduction of national defense spending "when the Soviet regime continues to supply military use with such a large part of the country's resources and pursue its existing policy of non-cooperation." The pursuit of collective security is also a necessity.

In the Labour Party's view, Britain is the common link between the three major national groups, and world peace mainly depends on the vigilance of these countries. The government is trying to strengthen these three interdependent and interconnected groups, and their future cooperation largely depends on Britain, which is the only one that belongs to all three groups. The declaration strongly states that the door to cooperation with the Soviet Union remains open, as long as the Soviet government is willing to cooperate.

The movement for closer cooperation among European countries is the culmination of Britain's policy since the war. Western European countries cannot expect to prosper without progress towards closer unity. The value of the British to the Western European alliance lies in its support from the Commonwealth. Without Britain's help, the foundation for close links between the Western European alliance and the Commonwealth would probably never be laid.

The way Britain is pursuing complete economic independence has enabled it to have new and favorable relations with the United States. Most of the European recovery would have been impossible without American aid. "The British government has made it clear that it will never accept conditions that compromise freedom of choice, and the American government has not put forward such conditions." American trade unions have made a great contribution in upholding this "intelligent and generous view."

The Labour Party's third goal—eradicating poverty, unemployment, and near-famine—has already contributed to the following achievements: the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the European Economic Recovery Program have allocated credit loans and gifts, new forms of assistance have been implemented in the Middle East and the Far East, and Britain has cancelled rice and implemented bread rationing. The Labour Party is deeply proud of these efforts, which have stopped famine, disease, and collapse in vast areas, and will "continue to fulfill its responsibility as a good citizen of the world."

In the past four years, almost none of the forty colonies have failed to advance towards the goal of self-government. The Labour Party's economic policy towards the colonies is to export capital goods that the colonies urgently need to the colonies, thereby increasing the colonies' production. The Labour Party has also established many public enterprises in various colonies, including two new enterprise companies and the East African peanut planting project.

In addition, the Labour Party has also worked hard to improve the working environment in the colonies since the war, and has had huge plans for housing, education, medical prevention and research, and promoting agriculture and industry. In short, Britain and her colonies have joined hands to prepare to jointly eradicate ignorance, poverty, and disease, and solve the problems of colored peoples. (British News Service Draft)

Gromyko Photographed During Talks with Lie

### Consulates of Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia in Spain Bombed; Suspected to Be the Work of Anti-Franco Factions

[United Press, Madrid, 16th] The consulates of Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru in Barcelona were damaged by bombings this morning. The ambassadors of the three countries in Madrid immediately protested to the Spanish Foreign Ministry. No one was injured in the explosions. Police believe that the case was caused by the fact that the three countries actively advocated the full restoration of diplomatic relations with Spain at the United Nations General Assembly.

[This Newspaper] No. 16 Meicun on Fanhangdu Road in Western Shanghai is the residence of Pan Xudong (35 years old, from Zhenjiang). Yesterday morning at around 2:20 AM, six robbers broke in, three of whom were armed. They demanded silence, ransacked the house, and stole eight gold rings, three watches, a radio, twelve silver dollars, and a raincoat. As they fled, Wang Baoqing, a 35-year-old coppersmith from Huzhou living at No. 8 in the same alley, who had recently suffered losses from stolen firewood stored in the alley, saw the robbers carrying weapons and followed them, shouting "Robbers!" This angered the robbers, who turned around and fired a shot at him, hitting him in the head and causing him to collapse. Seeing that they had caused a major incident, the robbers fled towards North Caojiazhai. At that time, two leather merchants, Zhang Dequan and Luo Shangfa, were passing by. The robbers, on the pretext of enforcing the curfew, stopped them and attempted to search them for valuables. Fortunately, Lu Dongbo, a volunteer police squad leader from the French Concession Branch, was on patrol and noticed the robbers questioning them. Suspecting something was amiss, he immediately notified the French Concession Road Police Station. A patrol officer led police to the scene, and Wei Jinquan, a member of the judicial section of the French Concession Police Station, led 50 plainclothes and uniformed police officers in police vehicles to the scene. The robbers, attempting to strike first, opened fire, resisting arrest. Police officers No. 5710 and 3720, as well as volunteer police officers, returned fire. The robbers fled into the darkness. After a search, it was discovered that two robbers had fled to the residence of Dr. Cao Kaibang at No. 72 North Caojiazhai.

They confessed that their accomplices, Hou Biao, Li Denggao, Tao Changcai, and Mi Laowu, were still at large. A search was conducted, but they were not found.

Another report: Silver shops listed the price of gold jewelry exchanged for silver dollars at 48 and 51, with an additional 2 yuan for factory bars.

### Silver Dollar Market Remains Firm

[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday, the silver dollar market was quiet. All transactions were suspended as merchants awaited the Central Bank's official rate. However, street-level silver bulls were rampant, and underground trading increased daily, with off-market prices continuing to rise.

Another report: Yesterday, the silver coin market remained weak. Due to an oversupply and insufficient demand, it lacked the power to rise. Twenty-cent coins were quoted at 130,000-170,000 [currency units], ten-cent coins at 60,000-80,000, and five-cent coins at 30,000-50,000, with little fluctuation.

Tea Market Stable

Amidst the spreading flames of war, prospective buyers in the tea market hesitated, causing transactions to nearly cease. Initially, sellers, pressured by cash flow, attempted to unload their stock regardless of cost, leading to a price decline. However, recently, the inflationary trend in non-tea commodities has reignited, and tea reserves are dwindling. As a result, even with few buyers, most sellers prefer to hold onto their stock, leading to a firming trend. Prices have become more stable than before, and the outlook no longer appears precarious.

Tung Oil Rises

After a prolonged period of stagnation, the tung oil market suddenly experienced a surge yesterday. At closing, standard-weight white oil rose to 100 million [currency units] per dan (a unit of weight). Both the standard and premium Xihong brands were trading at 100 million [currency units] beyond customs, equating to 120 million [currency units] and 115 million [currency units] per barrel, respectively. This was due to rising gold prices and renewed confidence. Holders raised prices sharply, but buying interest waned, and overall trading remained lackluster.

### Completion of Pipe Laying on Changshou Branch Road

[Report from this Newspaper] During rainy weather, the Changshou Branch Road in western Shanghai would become muddy.

### Bandit Xiong Bingnan Executed in Jiangwan

[Central News Agency] The bandit Xiong Bingnan, originally named Jiang Boqi, committed a kidnapping in 1937 and was sentenced to fifteen years in prison. At the end of the same year, he was temporarily released on bail due to the tense situation. Around that time, the Haimen County Judicial Office was ordered to transfer seriously convicted criminals to Chongming. They hired a sailing ship from Qinglong Port for the transport. During the voyage, Jiang Boqi and two others, Chen Jixin, were introduced by the escorting officer Huang Zhenfei. On the high seas, they produced handguns, released all the prisoners from their shackles, and then tied up the escorting officers Lu Tingxi, Huang Nengyu, Li Tingsen, Gu Deqing, Chen Yushan, Ji Dianhua, He Fuxiang, and Xu Jianhao, throwing them into the sea to their deaths. They stole public funds and property and fled to Shanghai, using the alias Xiong Bingnan.

### The Mystery of Xikang's Population

— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper Xu Renchang

[Report from this Newspaper, Ya'an, 6th via airmail] Remote Xikang has always been shrouded in mystery in the minds of people. When it comes to its population, some say it is 5 million, some say 3 million, and some say only 1.5 million. Comparing the highest estimate of 5 million with the lowest estimate of 1.5 million, the difference is a staggering 3.5 million. This large discrepancy is due to the fact that Xikang has never had an accurate population census. Many figures are just casual estimates. Furthermore, some estimates include the entire territory of Xikang, regardless of ethnicity or whether administrative power reaches there, while others only count the Kang and Han ethnicities that can be investigated, excluding the border populations. Neither of these methods is accurate or reliable, and the mystery of Xikang's population remains unsolved.

Now, relevant departments have conducted a preliminary survey and statistics, which can be said to be valuable data for studying borderland and population issues. The entire province includes fifteen ethnicities, totaling 1,917,397 people, with 999,037 males and 918,360 females. The Han ethnicity numbers 1,110,183, with 554,925 males and 555,231 females. They are distributed in the Ning, Ya, and Kang prefectures. The ten counties and bureaus of Ning Prefecture (excluding Puge and Lunin) account for about 50%, the six counties of Ya Prefecture account for about 40%, and the nineteen counties of Kang Prefecture account for about 10%. The Kang ethnicity numbers 185,477, with 93,976 males and 91,501 females, and are distributed in the counties of Kang Prefecture. The Tibetan ethnicity numbers 4,172, with 1,837 males and 1,335 females. The Lolo ethnicity (Black Yi) numbers 180,144, with 104,788 males and 75,556 females (excluding Lunin). The Lolo ethnicity (White Yi) numbers 169,634, with 91,024 males and 78,610 females. These Black and White Yi people are scattered throughout the Ning Prefecture. The Shuitian ethnicity numbers 23,750, with 2,270 males and 12,483 females. The Mosuo ethnicity numbers 74,946, with 46,461 males and 28,485 females, residing in various parts of Ning Prefecture, in the southwest, and in places like Ba'an. The [blank] ethnicity numbers 483, with 242 males and 241 females, residing in Dechang County. The Fan ethnicity numbers 71,457, with 28,074 males and 43,383 females. The Manchu ethnicity numbers 826, with 452 males and 374 females, residing in Baoxing County. The Miao ethnicity numbers 5,925, with [blank],510 males and 1,821 females. The Gami ethnicity numbers 12,363, with 5,214 males and 7,149 females. The Lisu ethnicity numbers 56,792, with 38,931 males and 17,861 females. The Gucong ethnicity numbers 30,000, with 17,646 males and 12,354 females. All the above ethnicities are scattered throughout the counties and bureaus of Ning Prefecture. The Gayong ethnicity numbers 3,136, with 1,625 males and 1,511 females, residing only in a corner of Kangding.

The population distribution in Xikang is quite uneven. Ya Prefecture is relatively prosperous, Ning Prefecture is second, and Kang Prefecture is last. This is the result of the population statistics, and it is also true based on imagination. However, according to the natural environment, Ning Prefecture has a mild climate and abundant produce. It can be considered a naturally blessed place in Kang Province, but its population density is not as high as that of Ya Prefecture. This is due to the border affairs problem. In the past, Han villages were often robbed by bandits. All the people and their belongings had to be moved elsewhere, and they fled in all directions. Even fertile fields were abandoned. Therefore, the population of Ning Prefecture not only did not increase, but decreased day by day. Since the establishment of the province, the authorities have used this data to determine policies - the Three Transformations Policy, and the principle of equal treatment for Han and Yi people, so that Han and Yi people live in peace with each other. This has indeed achieved considerable success. This can't be denied as a success. Kang Prefecture has a vast territory, but the population is the smallest. From a superficial point of view, it seems to be due to the high altitude and cold weather. In reality, the main reason is that Buddhism is prevalent in the Kang region. Lamas are a special class who do not marry. Because the Lamas control political and religious power, the people of Kang are proud of them and send their children to become Lamas. Therefore, the population has not increased for a long time, and may even be decreasing. Other reasons include the complexity of ethnicities, poor marriage systems, and reliance on gods for healing instead of medicine. These are all reasons for the population decline. The provincial authorities are also trying to remedy this situation by respecting religion and changing customs. This has also achieved some success.

### Talking About Anhui Tea During the Tea Season

— Correspondent for this Newspaper Dong Min

Southern Anhui is a tea-producing area, especially famous for "Tun Green" and "Qi Red" teas, known both domestically and internationally. In earlier years, it exclusively occupied a large portion of foreign exchange earnings, and it remains a significant export specialty area. Over the past decade, frequent warfare has devastated the rural economy, and commerce has gradually declined. The 400,000 tea farmers, tea merchants, and tea workers who rely on tea for a living depend entirely on the tea season for their annual sustenance. However, manufacturers and transporters lack the capital to purchase raw tea, and tea farmers are unable to pick and roughly process the tea. Moreover, even if they did pick the tea, there would be no buyers. Since the Anti-Japanese War, they have relied on government loans for their operations. If loans are not provided in a year, the tea fields are abandoned in that year. In addition, the delays in loan disbursement in the past have meant that funds arrived too late, directly affecting production and quality. At the same time, government loans have primarily targeted tea merchants and have not been directly disbursed to tea farmers, creating an unfavorable situation in which intermediaries exploit and undercut prices. The tea market is of paramount importance to the economy and finance of southern Anhui. The tea season begins around the Qingming Festival in the lunar calendar each year and ends before the Mid-Autumn Festival, lasting approximately 200 days, accounting for three-fifths of the year. As the wheat fields ripple and the rapeseed flowers bloom, this year's tea season has arrived. Tea farmers and tea merchants are anticipating tea loans like a severe drought awaiting clouds. Local authorities, responding to requests from various sectors, have telegraphed the relevant national banks, urging them to promptly announce this year's tea loan plan, simplify loan procedures, seize the opportunity, and prevent production from being adversely affected.

Southern Anhui has a vast tea-producing area, with Tunxi and Qimen serving as the key hubs for processing and transportation. The manufacturing and packaging for tea sold domestically and exported to Europe and the United States vary. The estimated total output and production area of export tea this year are as follows:

(1) Tun Green Area: Xiuning 40,000 boxes, She County 20,000 boxes, Wuyuan 20,000 boxes, Jixi 4,000 boxes, Huo County 2,000 boxes, Qimen 5,000 boxes, Jingde 2,000 boxes, Taiping 2,000 boxes, Jing County 2,000 boxes, totaling 100,200 boxes, with each box weighing 60 catties, totaling 61,200 dan. (2) Qi Red Area: Qimen 20,000 boxes, Zhide 3,000 boxes, Guichi 2,000 boxes, totaling 25,000 boxes, with each box weighing 50 catties, totaling 12,500 dan. The total export of red and green tea is 73,700 dan.

Production Costs

According to tea industry estimates, the production costs for red and green tea this year are: (1) The estimated cost of green tea at the factory is 150 silver dollars per dan, totaling 9.18 million silver dollars. (2) The estimated cost of red tea at the factory is 200 silver dollars per dan, totaling 2.5 million silver dollars. The total cost of red and green tea is 11.68 million silver dollars. If 70% of the cost is covered by loans, a total of 8.176 million silver dollars is needed. The types and timing of loans are divided into three categories: "primary processing," "secondary processing," and "transport and sales." Loans for primary processing of Tun Green tea should be disbursed before "Grain Rain," and loans for secondary processing should be disbursed before "Beginning of Summer." Loans for transport and sales should be disbursed half a month after secondary processing. Loans for primary processing of Qi Red tea should be disbursed before "Qingming," and loans for secondary processing should be disbursed before "Grain Rain." Loans for transport and sales should be disbursed half a month after secondary processing. Loans for primary and secondary processing account for 40%, while loans for transport and sales account for 60%. According to the tea industry's suggestions, (1) The Central Relief Committee and the Provincial Government should immediately announce the loan plan and date. (2) Simplify procedures. (3) Before the Central Tea Loan is disbursed, the Provincial Bank should be instructed to provide credit loans first. (4) The tea area business in western Anhui has ceased. The Provincial Government is requested to transfer last year's loan funds to this year's southern Anhui tea area to expand lending. (5) The Provincial Bank should jointly form a tea loan group with the national banks providing loans to improve efficiency and jointly disburse the loans. The above are the opinions of the tea industry and represent the interests of tea merchants. Although they have not stated that loans should be given to tea merchants, according to past examples, loan banks believe that tea merchants have organizations, fixed factory locations, and can influence the repayment deadline, and can send personnel to the factory to supervise. On the other hand, tea farmers are scattered in the countryside, numerous, disorganized, and lack sound organizations. Cooperatives are just a signboard. However, the government's original intention of loans was to benefit both tea farmers and tea merchants. Giving all the loans to tea merchants primarily aims to increase their purchasing power. In reality, tea farmers who bring tea to sell often find that they do not earn enough to cover their costs due to the calculation of color and quality. Besides painfully taking losses, there is no other way. Because of this suppression, many tea farmers are angered and abandon their tea gardens. Improving the loan methods seems to be necessary. Otherwise, if things continue as before, tea farmers will not grow tea, tea merchants will have no tea to process, and the national bank may not need to provide tea loans again, but the loss in foreign exchange is always a significant loophole.

Miscellaneous Tea Talk

Besides the red and green teas exported abroad, the domestic Qing tea produced in southern Anhui is probably known to everyone, and it can be said that everyone needs it. However, southern Anhui is very large, with high mountains, low mountains, plains, fertile land, and barren land. Naturally, the tea produced varies in quality. The new tea will soon be on the market, and I will talk about it here. The best Qing tea in southern Anhui is produced in Taiping County and Jing County. The tea produced there is listed as Yuqian tea. It is bright green, and the leaves are thick, large, straight, and flat. When viewed in sunlight, it contains hidden hairs. When brewed with boiling water, its fragrant aroma floats with the heat, and the tea liquid is as clear as lake water. The Yuqian tea produced in Ningguo County and Jixi County has small, thin leaves, green in color with a hint of yellow. Each leaf is pointed, and its white hairs are clearly visible. Over time, it loses its green color and turns yellow with black spots. When brewed and drunk, the fragrance is also good, but it feels astringent on the tongue compared to Taiping and Jing County tea. Yuqian tea produced in Qingyang County has leaves that curl like iron wire, with a curved shape like monkey rings, and white hairs floating at the tip. It is dark green in color with hidden green, and it is also very palatable when brewed. It is slightly inferior to Ningguo tea, but the tea is very famous because the monks of "Jiuhua Mountain" often give this tea to pilgrims. Therefore, Qingyang tea sold in other places is said to have the beautiful name of "Jiuhua Maofeng," but it is not a particularly precious tea. The worst is the tea produced in the border areas of Xuancheng. The leaves look quite tender, but when brewed with water, the liquid is thin and tasteless. It not only lacks fragrance but also has a very unpleasant grassy smell. However, the new tea here comes out the earliest. It may grow before Qingming because it is produced on the plains, which are easily warmed by the sun and blended with spring rain, plus fertilizer. Therefore, it sprouts earliest. Tea merchants do not buy this kind of tea. At this time, the tea peddlers' opportunity arrives. They go to the homes of tea farmers in the border plains to buy it and shout in the streets: "Selling new tea, selling new tea..." People often see that the leaves look good and buy them home, but when they brew and drink it, they immediately know that it does not taste good and will not buy it again next time.

### Tongde Xie Sauce Garden Generously Assists Refugee Children

Respected Sirs: Having read in your esteemed newspaper about the more than two hundred refugee children from the Jiangsu Orphanage who fled from Xuzhou to Shanghai, I learned that their funding has been cut off, and the children lack food and clothing. They are only provided with thin porridge twice a day, without any side dishes for sustenance, leading to malnutrition and a gaunt appearance. Upon learning of this, our colleagues at the garden were deeply saddened. We visited this morning and confirmed the situation. With the intention of caring for the young, we will, starting today, have our garden and its affiliate, Changde Sauce Garden, deliver more than ten catties of pickles daily for them to eat with their meals, and we will also donate eight hundred bolts of flour to make shorts for the refugee children. Our garden's resources are limited, but we hope to express our shared human compassion and consider the nation's future generations by fulfilling our humble duty. We hope your newspaper will publish this letter, which will encourage the numerous charitable individuals in Shanghai. This is also a way to attract more investment to this cause.
