### Editorial: How to Channel Idle Capital?

——A Suggestion for the Authorities to Open Silver Dollar Deposits——

To alleviate the plight of general production enterprises, the Central Bank launched two types of loans a few days ago: one was a temporary direct loan, and the other was a loan for purchasing cotton yarn. As industrial and commercial enterprises teeter on the brink of bankruptcy, these timely loans can truly be called "sending charcoal in the snow." In any case, in principle, they are beyond reproach. However, judging from the market situation in the past two days, they have clearly caused significant changes, especially the loosening of money supply, even to the point of excess, resulting in a hundredfold increase in the value of gold, paper currency, and silver dollars. Taking gold as an example, yesterday's market price exceeded 10 billion, and US dollars have also surpassed 20 million, further indicating that idle capital in Shanghai is stirring. If measures are not taken to channel it early, it may inevitably cause a flood, leading to an irreversible crisis.

In theory, there are many ways to channel idle capital, such as issuing public bonds, promoting savings, selling materials, gold, silver, and silver dollars, selling state-owned assets, establishing investment markets, and encouraging people to invest in real estate. However, at this stage, many of these methods are probably not easy to implement. Even if implemented, they may not be effective. Because the government's credibility has not yet recovered to the pre-war level, the sales aspect is problematic. Promoting savings, at a time when currency value is extremely unstable, unless value-protected deposits that effectively protect the interests of depositors are offered, it is difficult to arouse public interest. Selling gold, silver, silver dollars, and materials is simply impossible. Even if silver dollars are sold, silver dollars are currently huge amounts of paper currency, which would only fuel the momentum of idle capital, with more harm than good. As for establishing investment markets, in the current atmosphere of industrial and commercial recession, it may not be easy to achieve practical results. As for selling state-owned assets and encouraging people to invest in real estate, in this time of war and chaos, it is practically just empty talk. Therefore, discussing channeling idle capital at present is indeed an extremely difficult task. If we cannot stand idly by, we believe that engaging in the business of opening silver dollar deposits is more likely to achieve results.

The silver dollar deposit business was initially piloted by the Gansu Provincial Bank. Later, at the advocacy of academics, it aroused widespread attention in society. The Star Five Symposium of the financial community in this city held on March 11th concentrated on discussion. The results of the meeting mostly agreed that this business, in the current situation of fluctuating currency value, is still an effective countermeasure for channeling idle capital. At the same time, the financial authorities also recognized the role of silver dollar deposits in absorbing idle capital, so they adopted it in the revised new financial reform plan and ordered its implementation throughout the country. As for the authorities in this city, they believe that the situation is special and have postponed implementation. Therefore, the silver dollar deposit business in this city has not yet officially started. However, underground deposits have not only started early but have also become popular. According to the Financial Daily on the 19th, the interest rate is approximately 8 to 10 cents per month, which shows how eager people are for silver dollar deposits.

Now that silver dollars are widely used as chips, the so-called idle capital or excess purchasing power must include silver dollar holders, and should target silver dollar holders. We believe that silver dollars themselves have real value, and people are more likely to be guaranteed when they are requisitioned (i.e., deposited in banks). They will not excessively evade. Moreover, the unit quantity of silver dollar deposits is fundamentally different from that of gold yuan coupons. Absorbing silver dollar deposits is naturally more substantial in terms of quality, which means that the effect of conducting deposits is, of course, quite significant. However, to prevent the mischief of idle capital by emphasizing the convenience of silver dollar deposits and changing the people's tendency to save, it is necessary to pay attention to the technology of silver dollar deposits, the most important of which are the interest rate level, the length of the term, and the price flexibility should conform to the natural level of the market. In short, we feel that this time the bank must effectively guarantee the credit of silver dollar deposits. The credit of silver dollar deposits is the credit of the bank itself. If the bank cannot maintain the credit of deposits, it is equivalent to the collapse of the entire bank. The banking community itself must pay special attention to this. Secondly, it is best to entrust the deposit-absorbing institutions to commercial banks to avoid involvement in political whirlpools. Before the interest is paid, it must be paid in hard currency to enhance credit. As for the fractional amounts, silver dimes have now been introduced. There should be no problem with the collection and payment of units above the dime. For amounts below the dime, which are small, it will not harm the interests of depositors if they are paid in gold yuan coupons at the listed price.

This city is currently in a time of war, and everything needs stability to avoid many unnecessary disturbances. Preventing the mischief of idle capital can not only prevent the surge in prices but also stabilize finance. Now that the storm of idle capital is brewing and about to strike, the authorities must pay attention to preventing it before it happens. As for opening silver dollar deposits, it is only a more concrete and effective countermeasure to prevent the flooding of idle capital at present!

### Frontline Report from Yuepu

— By Our Special Correspondent Shi Zhi

Our group then changed to a small road in a fragmented manner. At this time, the planes left, and the sound of artillery rang again! Two hundred meters was such a distant journey at that time. With great difficulty, we walked across a stone bridge and entered a village of about four or five households. In a house with glass windows and a red lacquered Eight Immortals table, we met Commander Guo Yong of a certain division, Commander Zhang Canguang of a certain regiment, and Commander Zou Pengqi of a certain army and Chief of Staff Zhou Yuangen of a certain army who participated in commanding the attack.

It turns out that the positions built by the National Army on the front line are indeed "pocket-shaped positions," including the northernmost ××× via ××× to ×× as one large pocket, ×× via ×××, ×××, ×× as another large pocket; ×× via ××, ×××× to ×× as yet another large pocket. The large pockets are further divided into several small pockets. Due to the strong fortifications of the National Army at the forefront of each Budapest tip, that is, the most prominent points of the National Army positions, such as Shizilin, Yuepu, Yangxing, and Liuhang, and the bravery of the soldiers, and their independent combat spirit, the Communist army has suffered losses of two armies in the past week and has gained nothing.

According to Chief of Staff Yang, on the night of the 17th, a part of the Communist 31st Army continued to attack the National Army's pocket-shaped positions between Yuepu and Yangxing. The National Army positions in Yanjiazhai, more than 100 meters south of this village, were completely destroyed by Communist artillery fire, and Company Commander Zhu Xiangwen led his entire unit to their death. On the 18th, a certain division of Commander Zou Pengqi's army and the original Guo division, along with a part of the tanks, counterattacked forward. Three hours ago, they recovered Yanjiazhai, restored the original positions, and completely annihilated the Communist army that had entered the pocket-shaped positions. Generals Zou and Guo personally came to this front line to supervise the battle.

Since the National Army positions in Yuepu were too prominent, and the battle was still in progress at that time, we could only go to a nearby high ground and look west with binoculars. Yuepu is less than half a kilometer west of here, so in a 10,000x telescope, the dilapidated houses of Yuepu can be seen clearly. The expanse of golden wheat fields, already ripe but unharvested, evokes infinite emotion. According to Director Dai: To take care of the common people, in the past, we could not bear to cut the wheat seedlings that were about to ripen. For the sake of the common people, even though it was for the military's "clearing the field of fire," we still tried our best not to demolish the common people's houses. But we never thought that this would provide the Communist army with the most favorable cover for the attack. Otherwise, the Communist army's casualties would be even greater than they are today. Commander Zhang said, "Until now, there are still more than 2,000 corpses and more than 600 guns on the streets of Yuepu. Both sides avoid casualties, so no one dares to come out to bury them, and no one dares to pick up the guns. A few days ago, when our army conducted a major sweep, we picked up more than 100 guns."

At this time, the sound of artillery rang again. One shell landed in the fields more than 100 meters east of the house. Commander Guo judged from the sound that it was a Communist field gun. He said, "It's really lively here every day after sunset!" Then he asked me, "Are you afraid?" I replied, "With you here, I'm not afraid!"

In my conversation with Commander Zou, I learned that the former commander of that army, Hu Changqing, was wounded in the chest by a bullet in the Battle of Xuancheng on April 24th and is now recuperating in Taiwan, but his life is not in danger. At about the same time, Yang Sensen's commander, Yang Cancai, a famous general from Sichuan, died valiantly in the Battle of Wanzhi. Hu and I were new acquaintances. Last winter, when touring the scenic Langya Ancient Temple in Chuxian County, he treated me to a meal. Yang can be called a close friend. He quoted as a military precept: "A chisel cannot be separated from brothers, and an expedition cannot be separated from father and son." Every time I think of it, I am fascinated. Today, learning the news of one being injured and one dying in battle, my mood is quite complex and heavy.

On the way back after bidding farewell to Generals Zou and Guo, the sound of machine guns gradually faded away, but the artillery of both sides continued to roar. We were traveling in the dead angle formed by the arc of the artillery shells fired by both sides, but occasionally Communist shells landed near us. Therefore, we all dispersed with caution and fear, choosing low-lying paths to move forward. Along the way, I saw plump and solid soybeans that no one harvested, and golden wheat ears hanging low, but no one harvested them. In all the houses, near and far, that we passed, there was not a wisp of smoke, not a single common person. Section Chief Wang told me: This year is indeed a good year here, but the people in the war zone have indeed done their best to help the country, so he once suggested to Commissioner Gu Zhenggang when he went to the front: The houses in Shanghai that are used as "higher-level refugees" going to Hong Kong and Taiwan should be given to this group of truly homeless refugees, otherwise the burden that this war places on the people would be too unfair. Commissioner Gu agreed with his view, but believed that the problem was that there were too many difficulties in implementation.

With great difficulty, probably after walking at least three or four kilometers, we stepped onto the Bao (Shan) Wu (Song) Highway. Here, we saw machines used to open mountains doing construction, groups of stretcher teams and truck teams transporting wounded soldiers heading south, and tank teams heading north. Artillery teams arranged on the side of the highway were firing west.

On the side of the highway, I found that our jeep was waiting in a ten-wheeled truck used to pull artillery. Finally, we had initially concluded this most arduous journey. Everyone got into the jeep. In the car, I asked the driver Chai if he was afraid. He said: No, he drove for the newspaper during the Battle of August 13th. Section Chief Wang also told me: "After the Battle of Shanghai, the Associated Press once sent someone to ride in a tank to report from the battlefield, but when it approached the front line, the first tank in the lead was hit and injured by a Communist flat-trajectory gun. Therefore, the tank in which the foreign reporter was sitting could only drag the injured tank back to the rear halfway! The Shanghai News should be the pioneer of reporters running into dangerous scenes on the battlefield." (To be continued)

### Bevin and Acheson Arrive in Paris; Britain, America, and France to Hold Talks; Review Joint Countermeasures on the German Question

[Reuters, London, 20th] The foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union all departed for Paris today to prepare for the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, which opens on the 23rd. US Secretary of State Acheson is scheduled to depart from Washington by plane tonight and will arrive in Paris in time to hold talks with the British and French foreign ministers before the opening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference to unify the three powers' steps in the meeting. A dispatch from Moscow said that Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky will also leave the Soviet capital for Paris within 24 hours. When British Foreign Secretary Bevin left London this morning, he told reporters about the possible outcome of the conference, saying, "It's all up to God." With no more than 48 hours to the opening of the conference, all Europeans are calling for the meeting to be convened with tension, which was decided by the four powers in New York recently when they agreed to lift the Berlin blockade.

[Associated Press, Paris, 19th] Senior diplomatic officials from the United States, Britain, and France here have completed a series of strategic negotiations today in preparation for the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference. They are currently awaiting the arrival of British Foreign Secretary Bevin on the 20th and US Secretary of State Acheson on the 21st in Paris. The three countries' representatives have held seven secret meetings. It is reported that the representatives have drafted a complete plan to enable Acheson, Bevin, and Schuman to agree with Vyshinsky.

[Associated Press, London, 19th] The British Cabinet on the 19th gave full power to Foreign Secretary Bevin, allowing Bevin to reject any proposals in the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference that would allow the Soviet Union to control Germany. It is reported that the British Cabinet has also decided to reject any proposals for German economic unification based on the equal value of marks issued in the East and West. Foreign Secretary Bevin led a delegation of 50 people and left for Paris by train on the 20th. The British Cabinet meeting on the 19th was a comprehensive review of the possible situations that may arise in the Paris meeting.

### Acheson Explains Diplomatic Policy; United States Congress Fully Supports; Plan to Rebuild West Germany Will Never Be Abandoned

[Associated Press, Washington, 19th] Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said tonight that the committee fully supports Acheson's position on resolving the German issue and said that Acheson has obtained full support from the Senate when he goes to Paris.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] Secretary of State Acheson is scheduled to fly to Paris tomorrow to attend the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. Today, he gave a detailed report on US foreign policy in a secret meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Afterwards, he issued a statement stating that the United States' policy of rebuilding democracy in West Germany will not change, and it will not yield to the Soviet Union in the Paris meeting, allowing its power to expand to West Germany.

Acheson also warned that the outcome of the four-country meeting is pessimistic, and no one can predict it. There is no need to be pessimistic about its results, and there is no need to have extravagant hopes for the material. US foreign policy is firm and consistent. If it is believed that there is a slight preliminary success, and the work of building a free world is no longer intensified, it will inevitably lead to tragedy. However, he continued, this meeting may have a better chance of reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union on the unification of Germany than previous meetings. In short, we hope to reach an agreement no matter what, and we have no intention of sacrificing the achievements we have already made or "hindering their future progress." Acheson also explained the outline of US foreign policy, saying, "We should have the determination not to shift with the rise and fall of international temperatures to avoid the Soviet Union manipulating our country's diplomatic relations. The purpose of adjusting our country's diplomatic policy is to obtain a world of peace and security, which has been the case in the past and will certainly be the main donkey in the future."

### Differing Positions of Major Powers on Promoting German Unification

[Reuters, London, 19th] Among the Western three countries participating in the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, Britain is more confident that it is more willing than the United States and France for Germany to achieve unification at this time. The connection between the British Labor government and the German Social Democratic Party in belief can be said to be consistent. Therefore, it is believed that under the leadership of the German Social Democratic Party, a unified Germany will be able to devote itself to the reconstruction of Europe without threatening the safety of neighboring countries. The British also feel that although Britain, the United States, and France are all willing for Germany to achieve unification under specific conditions, the United States does not currently intend to support full German unification measures. First, the United States is deeply afraid that the establishment of a unified German economic system will give the German Communist Party the opportunity to obstruct the reconstruction of West Germany. Furthermore, the United States is also opposed to the public ownership of the Ruhr region and other German heavy industries. If Germany's economic power is controlled by the Social Democratic Party or the Communist Party, the possibility of establishing such public ownership will be greater. France's opposition to Germany's too rapid unification is entirely based on security reasons. The British believe that most French people still advocate that Germany should remain divided for a long time. At the same time, some experts predict that the Soviet Union will make major concessions at the Foreign Ministers' Conference to promote German unification, thus deliberately threatening France to create tension within the Atlantic nations.

### Three Powers Reach Agreement on West German Election Law

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 19th] An official here claimed: After the French government reluctantly decided to approve the election law of the West German Federal Parliament, the Allied countries have reached an agreement on the election law. When the French government approved the law, it raised several reservations, stating that some powers reserved by the constituent assembly should be exercised by the state premier after the parliament is dissolved and the constitution is promulgated. The deputy military governors of the Western three powers met in Berlin today to draft a joint letter to the West German state premiers to inform them of this decision.

[Associated Press, Munich, 20th] The Bavarian Parliament recently voted 101 to 64, with nine abstentions, rejecting the West German constitution drafted by the Bonn Parliament. Of the eleven federal states in West Germany, four federal parliaments have already passed the Bonn Constitution. The constitution requires the approval of two-thirds of the federations. Bavaria is the first federation to reject the constitution. However, the Bavarian Parliament decided that if the other two-thirds of the federations pass the constitution, the Bavarian Parliament will also accept it. At the same time, the Bavarian Parliament unanimously passed a proposal requesting the US military government to submit the German constitution issue to a popular vote.

### British Views on the Future Foreign Ministers' Conference

It is believed that there may not be major gains

[Reuters, London, 20th] The British public seems largely indifferent to the gains of the current Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference. Due to the prolonged Cold War, and the austerity plan at home has restricted the people in every way, the most concerned by the general public is how to obtain enough cigarettes and how to spend the holidays comfortably. Few newspapers, except for the "Daily Mail" and "The Times," mention the Paris meeting. The "Daily Mail" believes that the lifting of the blockade is not a Soviet concession or a display of goodwill, so it hopes that Western countries will be wary. "The Times" predicts that the most the Foreign Ministers' Conference will achieve is to make Germany form a loose federation with two units, to accommodate the existing facts between East and West Germany. Its central institutions will only make Germany tend to unify economically. Government officials' opinions can be divided into two factions: one faction believes that the Soviet Union's concession is just a kind of propaganda for the Germans; the other faction believes that the Soviet Union has to make concessions. In order to gain a foothold in the control of the Ruhr area, the Soviet Union may agree not to demand in-kind compensation from Germany.

### Soviet Union Temporarily Opens Helmstedt Highway

Trucks from Hamburg to Berlin are Blocked Again

[Associated Press, Berlin, 19th] The Soviet Union temporarily lifted the blockade on the Helmstedt Highway on the 19th, allowing trucks that had been blocked for 42 hours to enter Berlin, but at the same time, the Soviet Union began to block trucks traveling from Hamburg to Berlin. The Western Allied authorities are bewildered and furious at the Soviet Union's obstruction tactics. The opening of the Helmstedt Highway was realized within minutes after the British occupying army's chief of staff, Weisdelorub, lodged a protest with the Soviet side, but the Soviet side did not give any explanation.

### Matthews Appointed Secretary of the Navy; US Senate Approves

Clay Promoted to Four-Star General

[United Press, Washington, 19th] The US Senate today approved the appointment of Matthews as Secretary of the Navy, and at the same time approved the retirement of Clay, the former US military governor of Germany, and promoted him to a four-star general. In addition, Kimball was approved as Deputy Secretary of the Navy, and Clay as Deputy Secretary of the Army.

### Pons Appointed French High Commissioner to Germany

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] The former French Ambassador to Germany, Pons, has been appointed as the French High Commissioner to Germany. Pons is 62 years old, a journalist by training. He served as the French Ambassador to Germany in 1931 and as the Ambassador to Italy in 1938. After the outbreak of the war, he was detained in a concentration camp by the German secret police and was released only after the victory.

### Soviet Union Announces Remaining 95,000 Japanese Prisoners of War; All to be Repatriated This Year; Allied Headquarters Estimates Over 400,000 Japanese Prisoners of War Still Remain in the Soviet Union

[United Press, Moscow, 20th] Soviet officials announced today that the remaining 95,000 Japanese prisoners of war in the Soviet Union will be repatriated to Japan between May and the end of November this year, with the exception of a few war criminals. All repatriation expenses should be borne by the Japanese government. During the war, the Soviet Union obtained a total of 594,000 Japanese prisoners of war, of which 70,810 were directly released in 1945, and another 418,166 were repatriated before May 1, 1949.

[United Press, Tokyo, 20th] Officials at MacArthur Headquarters expressed surprise at the Soviet Union's announcement that only 95,000 Japanese prisoners of war remain in the Soviet Union. According to Anderson, director of the headquarters' prisoner of war repatriation division, it is estimated that 408,729 Japanese prisoners of war still remain in the Soviet Union.

### US Army and Navy to Hold Major Exercises in Hawaii This Fall

[United Press, San Francisco, 19th] The Army Department recently announced that major army and navy exercises will be held on the island of Hawaii this fall, under the overall command of General Clark. Clark has already discussed this plan with Admiral Bogan, commander of the First Mobile Fleet. A large number of invading troops will be dispatched during the exercise, including the main force of the Second Infantry Division of the Sixth Army.

### Nepal Applies to Join the United Nations; Soviet Union Expresses Opposition

[Reuters, Lake Success, 19th] When the United Nations Security Council's Committee on the Admission of New Members reviewed Nepal's application to join the United Nations today, the Soviet representative expressed opposition. He said that based on the information he knew, he was not satisfied that Nepal was a sovereign and independent country, so he advocated not discussing Nepal's application for the time being, pending more detailed information being obtained. He also pointed out that the treaty signed between Britain and Nepal in 1923 actually only made Nepal completely obey Britain and did not give Nepal the sovereignty of foreign relations. Ukrainian representative Garaga also supported the Soviet Union's position, pointing out that Nepal's foreign exchange is completely controlled by India. China, Britain, the United States, France, Egypt, Norway, Canada, and other countries all supported Nepal's application. Chairman and French representative Rose said that Nepal's representative is now in New York. He suggested that the committee ask the representative to provide full information on all treaties signed between Nepal and Britain. The Soviet representative still expressed his doubts about whether the committee has the right to request this information. He advocated that the committee report to the Security Council, stating that the information obtained on Nepal was not sufficient, and then the Security Council should decide what measures to take.

### Soviet Suggestion for Three-Power Discussion on the Greek Situation Rejected Outright by the US and UK; Insistence that Resolution Be Sought Within the United Nations; UK Expresses Unwillingness to Create a "Second Munich"

[Our Dispatch] Washington, 20th Broadcast: The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 20th, rejecting the Soviet Union's proposal to resolve the Greek civil war outside the United Nations, and stated that the United States welcomes the Soviet Union's goodwill measures to end Communist support for the rebel army to resolve the Greek civil war. The statement was issued after Truman and the Cabinet met. The State Department stated: Unless Greece's neighbors stop assisting Greek guerrillas, the United States will continue to provide military aid to Greece.

[Our Dispatch] London, 20th Broadcast: The British Foreign Office recently announced that the UK rejects the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a three-power conference to resolve the Greek issue. A Foreign Office spokesperson stated that the UK is unwilling to violate the will of the Greek government and sacrifice Greece, creating a second Munich.

### US Halts Japanese Reparations; China and the Philippines Express Dissent; Gu Weijun Criticizes Conflict with International Agreements

[U.S. News Service, Washington, 19th Dispatch] Representatives from China and the Philippines expressed dissent today regarding the United States' position presented to the Far Eastern Commission on May 12 concerning Japanese reparations and industrial levels.

Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun adopted a reserved stance regarding his government's position, stating that the Chinese government's position will be formally announced in the next meeting of the Far Eastern Commission. However, he also stated: "The Chinese government is deeply disappointed to learn that the United States has suddenly changed its position on the important issue of demanding reparations from Japan... We believe that these views conflict with a series of dignified international agreements and resolutions." Gu stated: The United States' opinion does not consider the security of the Pacific and is inconsistent with the basic principles and goals of the occupation of Japan.

[United Press, Washington, 19th Dispatch] Philippine representative Romulo today strongly criticized the United States' decision to stop shipping Japanese reparations in the Far Eastern Commission. It is claimed that: "This move is tantamount to restoring Japan's war-making capabilities. Japanese zaibatsu are undermining the United States' efforts to revive the Japanese economy, proving to cause sympathy from the U.S. and ensure U.S. assistance. The biggest reason the U.S. stopped transporting reparations is to reduce the burden on American taxpayers to supply Japan, but most of this burden is caused by the Japanese not being able to help themselves, especially the zaibatsu manipulating behind the scenes. The Japanese zaibatsu want to rise again and must revive the army and navy. We must stop this ambition in time. To date, most of the Japanese reparations shipped to the Philippines, the United Kingdom, China, and the Netherlands are mother machines and other equipment, worth a total of approximately $170 million, and no factories have been dismantled. The Philippine government still hopes that the Far Eastern Commission can establish a fair and satisfactory solution to the reparations issue."

### Social Bureau Plans to Accommodate Refugees; Negotiating to Borrow the Great World; Four Refugee Shelters to Be Set Up in the Urban Area

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, our reporter interviewed Director Chen of the Social Bureau, asking about the measures taken by the bureau to provide relief to refugees during the Battle for Greater Shanghai. According to Director Chen, the municipal government is actively handling relief for refugees from the suburbs who have sought refuge in the city due to the war. More than 1,000 citizens in the Longhua District sought refuge in the city. Senators Zhang Xuelian and District Chief Yang Jishi allocated 200 shi of rice from the Social Bureau for relief. The Pudong Fellow Villagers Association still has 300 shi of rice in storage, which can last for a period of time. The refugee reception location is planned to borrow the Great World Amusement Park, which is being negotiated by the Garrison Department and the Great World. Four refugee shelters will be set up in the urban area to accommodate refugees in groups. The four districts of Jiangwan, Dachang, Wusong, and Xinshi form one group. Zhenru and Beixinjing form one group. In Pudong, Gaoqiao, Yangjing, and Sisheng form one group. Longhua District forms a separate group. Currently, Renji Hall on Yunnan Road has begun to accommodate refugees. Director Chen finally hoped for two points: (1) Hope that the Garrison Department will quickly solve the problem of housing for refugees. (2) Hope that those with money will contribute money so that the refugee relief work can proceed smoothly.

Yesterday, a senior official of the Social Bureau said: (1) The Social Bureau, together with the United Relief Committee and various charitable organizations, has already accommodated more than 6,000 refugees. (2) Refugees who have entered the city but have not entered the shelters are currently looking for places to accommodate them in various districts. (3) For refugees who have not sought refuge in the city and are still outside Mucheng, the Social Bureau has allocated 1,000 shi of rice and entrusted it to the district offices in the suburbs for relief. The number of people will be reported by the district offices in the suburbs. The transportation problem is being negotiated with the Garrison Department.

Several gold firms suspended trading one after another. As usual, the market inside hit the upper limit, rising again to 7.96266 billion, with demand exceeding supply and still facing stagnation. Off-exchange prices were quoted without any standard, skyrocketing, but with very few transactions, as no one was willing to sell, creating a one-sided buying spree. The morning opened at 7.5 billion and 7.8 billion, with no action from the Central Bank. In an instant, it surged through three levels. After ten o'clock, it had passed the 10 billion mark, reaching a peak of 11 billion or 12 billion. The midday price was 10.5 billion or 11.5 billion.

### Vegetable Promotion Committee: Introduction to Simple Cultivation Methods

[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Municipal Government's Vegetable Promotion Committee, in order to encourage the promotion of various vegetables on public and private vacant land in the urban area, has specially introduced various vegetables suitable for summer planting and their simple cultivation methods, for citizens to refer to when choosing seeds. If there are any questions regarding planting techniques, you can directly write to the Garden Management Office of the Bureau of Public Works at No. 2 Huangzha Road, Shanghai, to be forwarded to the committee for detailed answers.

(1) Chinese Cabbage: Can be sown at any time and harvested after half a month. Broadcasting or row sowing can be used. Before sowing the seeds, first loosen the soil. If the weather is dry, water once or twice after sowing and covering the soil. When two or three small leaves have grown after germination, apply decomposed manure water once. After half a month, when four or five leaves have grown, it can be harvested.

(2) Amaranth: The cultivation method is the same as Chinese cabbage. After ten days of germination, the seedlings can be harvested by pulling them out with the roots. If the seedlings grow to four or five inches long, pick the tender shoots for food. The roots can still be left in the soil to sprout new shoots for consumption. With continuous picking like this, it is only necessary to pay attention to applying manure water once every half month and irrigating once a day. After planting, it can continuously supply food for three months.

(3) Cabbage (i.e., head cabbage): Use ready-made seedlings and transplant them into garden plots that have been made into ridges. The distance between rows and between plants should both be about one foot and five inches. Other fertilization and irrigation are the same as for Chinese cabbage. After one month, the tender leaves can be harvested. After two months, it begins to form heads, and after another month, the heads can be picked for consumption.

(4) Cowpeas: Use cultivated seedlings and transplant them into the garden, or directly sow the seeds in the garden. Both cultivation methods should use three or four seedlings per plant. The distance between plants should be one and a half feet. After sowing and germination, if too many seedlings sprout, the weak seedlings can be removed as appropriate. When the seedlings grow to one foot tall, set up frames for them to climb. Subsequent fertilization and irrigation are the same as for Chinese cabbage. After two or three months, the pods can be picked for consumption.

(5) Green-skinned Winter Melon: Bury five or six seeds in each hole. When the weather is dry, water once or twice a day. After germination, remove the weak seedlings, leaving two or three seedlings per hole. Pay attention to fertilization and irrigation afterward, and it can be harvested after two and a half months.

(6) Eggplant: The cultivation method is the same as cowpeas. It can be harvested after two months.

(7) Soybean: The cultivation method is the same as cowpeas. Edamame can be harvested after two and a half months. It becomes soybeans after three months.

(8) Sword Bean: The cultivation method is the same as soybeans. However, it is advisable to build a fence frame for them to climb. The maturity period is the same as cowpeas.

(9) Four-season Radish: The cultivation method is the same as Chinese cabbage. The leaves and roots of young plants can be eaten. After forty or fifty days, the roots become enlarged and can be pulled out individually for consumption.

### The True Picture of Peace in Beiping (Continued from Yesterday)

The main purpose of this entry ceremony was to demonstrate strength, to let the people of Beiping see that they had so many troops and such good weapons. In the end, the goal was achieved. Many foreign reporters were surprised after seeing it, especially American friends. Seeing the 15mm howitzers, armored vehicles, and tanks that they had equipped the National Army with to defend against the Soviet Union now all adorned with bright Soviet flags, their frustration was imaginable. But the next day, I heard from friends in the 3rd Armored Regiment that the 28 armored vehicles, 6 tanks, and 2 15mm howitzers used in the entry ceremony were all borrowed from the National Army. They were borrowed on the morning of the 2nd. The national emblem was temporarily brushed off and replaced with a painted five-pointed red star. They paraded ostentatiously for a day, and on the afternoon of the 4th, the national emblem was repainted and returned. Although I don't know how much they got in the Northeast, what they boasted about in Beiping was borrowed to put on a show. But this inside story is known to only a few people, and their purpose of demonstrating strength was ultimately achieved, especially to foreign friends.

Having described the main characters, I will now report on some of the supporting characters. The main supporting characters were the art troupes formed by the Communist Party from various departments. They appeared on the streets at 8 o'clock in the morning, dressed in strange and varied costumes, each with their own ideas. But nine out of ten of them were led by portraits of Mao and Soviet flags, with a few powdered and made-up "war criminals" in the middle ranks, followed by men and women in paper-wrapped heads and red headscarves, twisting and turning forward in a Yangge dance, and then the cheering crowds waving flags. The most eye-catching was the National Changchun University. They made a large wooden turtle, with four wheels as its four feet. The turtle's head was inlaid with white. A president whom they had once shouted "Long Live" for, adorned with a turtle shell, was sitting on the back of the turtle, wearing a Stars and Stripes hat. Li Zongren, Chen Cheng, Sun Ke, and Chen Lifu, four war criminals, were biting it from all sides. Each of them had a sign stuck on their back saying "Execute war criminal so-and-so." Li and Chen were in glittering military uniforms, Sun was in a sharp suit, and Chen was in a blue robe. The first two were squatting, and the latter two were pushing. This art troupe was especially praised by the People's Daily the next day, which considered their design novel and their technique superb. The slogans that the crowds were taught to shout were roughly the following: (1) Welcome the People's Liberation Army, (2) Celebrate the liberation of Beiping, (3) Carry out the revolution to the end, (4) Smash the peace conspiracy, (5) The peace conspiracy is a cheap commodity made by the United States, (6) Down with the peace politicians, (7) Attack Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, (8) Insist on Chairman Mao's eight conditions.

February 12th, i.e., the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, was the Beiping citizens' celebration of the liberation of Beiping. This celebration was organized by several so-called pseudo-senators, who had been brewing peace before the liberation, and the original pseudo-bao-jia heads of the city, with the aim of flattering the Communist Party and expressing loyalty. At the beginning of the preparations, they did not contact the Communist Party beforehand. The Communist Party was busy with the takeover in those days and did not pay attention to it. Who knew that when it was almost time, the People's Daily suddenly pointed to this preparer as "CC," i.e., a special agent. It also said that they had not obtained permission from the authorities to prepare for this meeting and were not allowed to prepare. They were trying to flatter, but they tripped up. After much pleading, the Communist Party took over the organization, and the meeting was held as scheduled. The night before, the bao-jia heads notified each household to send a representative to gather at the designated location at 9 o'clock in the morning for a roll call. At that time, schools had not yet opened, so the principals were notified to bring the students to participate in the meeting. This meeting was held in Tiananmen Square. By 10 o'clock in the morning, it was crowded with people, and Soviet flags were flying. But everyone who participated knew how everyone came to be there. At 10:30, "the people of Beiping's own mayor," Ye Jianying, gave a speech. He first praised the Beiping-style peace, shouted a few "Long Live this, Long Live that" slogans, and then emphasized that the Communist Party would never be deceived, would never accept the disguised peace directed by the United States, and firmly advocated that Chairman Mao's eight conditions must be met before peace could be discussed. Finally, he announced that the task of the Beiping People's Government during the military control period was: (1) To completely eliminate the counter-revolutionary forces lurking in the city, (2) To establish a revolutionary regime, (3) To take over various agencies, (4) To build a new democratic order, (5) To dissolve the Kuomintang, the Social Democratic Party, the Youth Party, and all reactionary parties and groups, (6) To arrest war criminals and reactionaries at all levels. Many people, while listening respectfully, were secretly shivering. After the meeting, there was a parade. I saw many friends who were principals on the roadside, pulling long faces, holding a small red flag in their hands, and leading students who had not yet eaten breakfast and lunch, shouting "The peace conspiracy is a cheap commodity made by the United States" weakly. The large turtle, a masterpiece, reappeared, and the art troupes of the Communist Party from various departments danced the Yangge again, but people were already used to it, and there were far fewer onlookers on the roadside. (To be continued)

### Drastic Reduction in Supply, Vegetable Prices Soar, Request to Allow Transportation Awaits Approval from the Authorities

[East China News Agency] Due to the war, the supply of various vegetables has been drastically reduced. Yesterday, market prices rose sharply across the board. Pork was 12 million yuan per catty, yellow croaker was 4 million yuan per catty, broad beans and green vegetables were 600,000 yuan per catty, and pickled vegetables were 800,000 yuan per catty, all rising by one to three times compared to the previous day. Wang Dajun, Deputy Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, said: "Yesterday, the intense fighting in Pudong and other places affected the source of vegetables in the city, causing market prices to soar. This is of great importance to the people's livelihood. The vegetable market is requesting the Municipal Government to allow the transportation of vegetables from the suburbs, which is currently awaiting approval from the highest military authorities."

### Chairman Fang of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Committee Calls on Citizens to Defend Greater Shanghai

[Central News Agency] Fang Zhi, Chairman of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Committee, in order to awaken citizens' awareness of defending Greater Shanghai and to launch a campaign to raise funds to support the military, broadcast a speech on the Kaixuan Radio Station yesterday, titled "Defend Greater Shanghai." The original text is summarized as follows:

Compatriots: At this critical moment when the suburbs of Shanghai are filled with the sounds of artillery fire and the fight for victory, while the front lines are intensifying the offensive and fighting, the order in the urban area must be maintained calmly and steadily. We must not listen to rumors and cause mutual panic. We must know that the three Commanders-in-Chief of the National Army, Navy, and Air Force are stationed in Shanghai, supervising this sacred war to suppress the bandits. Their purpose is to defend Shanghai. Therefore, we can only achieve this goal by working together with the military and civilians, with one heart and one mind, to jointly maintain the security of the urban area and protect public utilities and production enterprises. Those who take the opportunity to cause trouble, spread rumors, and confuse the public are the common enemies of all citizens of our city. The local government and military organs should kill these scoundrels without mercy. Because without doing so, we cannot pacify the internal situation, and without pacifying the internal situation, we cannot suppress the bandits. I hope that all compatriots from all walks of life will pay attention to this.

### The Riverside Road is Sealed Off, Turning the Bustle into Desolation; The Starting and Ending Stations of Public Vehicles on Various Lines are Changed

[Our Dispatch] In order to strengthen the security of the urban area, the Songhu Garrison Command has sealed off the riverside road from Fuxing Island to Nanmatou from yesterday. As a result, the usually bustling Bund has been transformed into a quiet and desolate place. Military police are stationed at the Waibaidu Bridge and the intersections of various roads leading to the Bund, prohibiting the passage of ordinary vehicles and pedestrians. The high-rise buildings along the Bund are tightly closed, and people enter and exit through the back doors or side doors leading to the north-south roads. All trams and buses passing through the Bund have changed their starting and ending stations. Buses Nos. 9 and 10 have shortened their routes and are turning around on Nanjing Road Central Road, No. 3 is turning around at the Bund on Avenue Edward VII, No. 14 is turning around at the intersection of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road, and Nos. 4 and 11 are using Tiantong Road as their terminus. Tram No. 2's terminus has been changed to the intersection of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road. Tram Nos. 7, 8, 10, and 11 all use the northern end of Waibaidu Bridge as their terminus. Passengers traveling from north to south must get off at that point, and then the empty car travels across the bridge to the Bund on Wuma Road to turn around and return. Passengers going to Hongkou board the bus at the northern end of Waibaidu Bridge. Only Tram No. 1 can still carry passengers through the Bund, but the Bund stops have been changed to the entrance of the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road and the northern end of Waibaidu Bridge. Due to the rerouting of various vehicles and the change in the relationship between the upper and lower stations, the roads near the Bund, such as Sichuan Road and Jiangxi Road, are all congested with vehicles and crowded with pedestrians.

Fewer Passengers on Each Line

[Our Dispatch] After the transportation on the Bund was temporarily blocked by the authorities yesterday, the number of passengers on various public transport lines decreased even further. According to the ticket sellers on various tram and bus lines: "Business on all public vehicles has been extremely slow in the past two or three weeks. This is probably because most of the employees in the 'offices' have been unemployed or have reduced incomes." They have made a rough estimate of the recent situation: "The first-class passengers who used to travel at certain times now only a very few maintain the original status or have changed to third class, and those who used to travel in third class have changed to walking." This situation is especially true for the French-owned trams, and the scene of no empty seats has long passed. Although the prices of public vehicles have not been adjusted for a long time, and the prices charged by rickshaws are also usually only below 500,000 yuan, business is very slow. This shows that citizens have become accustomed to thrift.

### National Bank's Various Business Departments to Relocate Offices from the 23rd

[Our Dispatch] Since pedestrian traffic has been banned in the Bund area, it has been quite inconvenient for financial institutions originally located in the Bund area to conduct business. It is reported that the Central Bank has decided to move its external business departments to No. 999 Jing'an Temple Road (at the intersection of Maoming Road), the original site of the Bank of Communications, from the 23rd onwards, in order to facilitate contact with customers. The internal departments of the bank will remain at the original address on the Bund.

After the Bund was closed to traffic, the roads were deserted, with no people or vehicles in sight. (Photo by our newspaper)
