### The Yuepu and Other Areas Turn Quiet; The Pudong Battle Fully Unfolds

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters released battle situation reports: (1) A bandit force of over two thousand men launched a fierce attack on our Liuhang positions at 9:00 AM on the 19th. Our defending troops fought back bravely. After two hours of battle, the bandits were finally unable to withstand the attack and collapsed in retreat. In this battle, over one thousand bandits were killed or wounded, over one hundred were captured alive, and a large number of spoils of war were seized. Currently, the Liuhang and Yuepu areas are unusually quiet, an unprecedented calm since the beginning of the Shanghai defense battle.

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, 11:00 AM on the 19th, reported:

(1) After dusk on the 18th, fine rain blurred the scene, and the battles in the Yuepu and Yanghang areas turned quiet. Although the bandits had coerced a large number of militiamen in the past few days, attacking desperately, under the severe blows of the strong national army, their strength has been almost completely depleted. The remnants are now fleeing to areas far from the outskirts of Yuepu and Yanghang, taking a breather and reorganizing.

(2) At about 8:00 PM on the 18th, a portion of the bandit army that had fled north from Nanxiang advanced towards the national army positions of the International Radio Station near Liuhang. The defending troops, relying on strong fortifications, fought calmly and bravely. The bandits suffered heavy casualties, but our positions remained unshaken. As of the morning of the 19th, the two sides were still facing off.

(3) The battle in Pudong has fully unfolded. Late at night on the 18th, the national army at Qianlangzhong Bridge, Jinjia Bridge, and Dongsanlintang and other places simultaneously launched an active attack on the invading bandit army. Our brave air force also made a night appearance, providing aerial assistance in the battle. The bandit army was caught off guard, with many killed and wounded. Detailed battle results are still being investigated.

(4) Yesterday, over seven hundred bandits fled to the Donggou Wujiazhai area of Pudong. After we dispatched a team to suppress them, all were annihilated. (5) Over ten thousand bandits on the front line of Liujiahang launched continuous fierce attacks on our positions at 2:00 AM on the 19th. The battle was extremely fierce. Our artillery concentrated its firepower and fired fiercely, so the rumbling sound in the area never ceased last night. The bandits used human waves to throw themselves into our sea of fire, suffering heavy casualties, but our positions remained unshaken. The battle was still fiercely underway as of 10:00 AM on the 19th.

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters released battle situation reports:

(1) At 6:00 PM on the 18th, a bandit unit of about one company strength crossed the river southwest of Liuhang, attempting to sneak attack a certain division of our army. After we discovered them, our artillery bombarded them fiercely, annihilating most of them, with the rest fleeing in panic.

(2) On the evening of the 18th, about five or six hundred bandits attacked our positions west of the International Radio Station. Our defending troops calmly sniped at them, and the battle was extremely fierce. The bandits suffered more than half their casualties, and the remnants attempted to flee. Our officers and soldiers took advantage of the remaining power of victory to launch a counterattack. The bandits were routed at the sight of the attack and fled in all directions, but were completely annihilated by us.

(3) At around 1:00 AM on the 19th, about two bandit battalions in the northwest area of Gujiazhai repeatedly attacked our positions seven or eight times. Our defending officers and soldiers calmly countered, and the bandits, suffering casualties, retreated at dawn.

(4) About five hundred bandits on the front line of Liuhang secretly moved towards our positions before dawn on the 19th. After our officers and soldiers discovered them, they did not fire their guns, waiting for them to approach the barbed wire surrounding our bunkers. When our defending officers and soldiers saw that the opportunity to annihilate the bandits had arrived, they rushed out in two waves, throwing grenades fiercely, blasting and killing most of the bandits. The remaining bandits, seeing the fierce attack, had no time to respond and fled in panic.

### The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters Releases Comprehensive Battle Situation; National Army Closely Deployed in Areas Such as Xinzhuang and Qibao

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters released comprehensive battle situation reports:

(1) On the entire northwest line of Shanghai, the bandits have continuously launched separate fierce attacks on the positions of our defending troops at various strongholds for the past week. After our land, sea, and air forces cooperated and fought bravely, at least two armies of bandits have been largely annihilated by us by the evening of the previous day. The remnants also fled in the original direction. From 8:00 PM on the 17th, our defending troops in Shizilin, Yuepu, Yanghang, the International Radio Station, Liuhang, Gujiazhai, and other places launched a counterattack on another bandit army (totaling more than three army designations) that had recently been continuously drawn in as reinforcements in an attempt to reverse the decline. The bandits repeatedly used their inferior artillery fire as cover and launched more than six or seven human wave attacks on us overnight. The battle was unprecedentedly fierce, but the bandits ultimately did not succeed. In the fierce fighting until the morning of the 18th, the bodies of more than two thousand bandits were scattered in front of our army's positions. The bandits who had once broken into the positions south of Yuepu were also completely annihilated. Currently, the battles on that line have become quiet. (2) The national army defense lines in the Xinzhuang, Qibao, and Hongqiao Airport areas are now being reorganized to complete a close deployment. A strong force of excellent troops is stationed there. The bandit armies along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, attempting to approach the suburbs of Shanghai, are hesitant to move forward due to fear of the national army's artillery firepower. It is generally believed that our army's defense on that line is absolutely guaranteed to be safe. If the bandits dare to invade again, they will suffer the same severe blow as on the Yuepu-Yanghang line.

(3) Over thirty thousand bandits in the Pudong area launched a large-scale attack on Wangjiawan, Gaoxingzhen, and Xinluzhen and other places in separate groups at 10:00 PM on the 17th. Our army waited at leisure, and with the assistance of the Divine Eagles, their morale was extremely high. The fierce battle extended to the morning of the 18th. Our fresh troops continued to arrive to reinforce the attack, and finally completely defeated the bandits. Another group of bandits who slipped through and reached the vicinity of Nanqiao and Baziqiao south of the river is currently being surrounded and annihilated by our infantry and armored units.

### In the Battle to Defend the Wusong District, the New Navy Displays its Power, Laying the Foundation for the Victory of Defending Shanghai

The Great Shanghai Defense Battle has already achieved its first victory, and this victory is thorough. The Communist bandit army has suffered a loss of as many as twenty thousand people, and two armies have been routed. Under the strong land and air defense, our new navy, belonging to the fleet commanded by Commander Ma Jizhuang, used relentless artillery fire to destroy the enemy's attack.

The Communist bandits have begun to encounter strong resistance in their dream of attacking Shanghai, and have declared their failure. This is only a beginning for us in defending Greater Shanghai. What will follow will be countless victories, and immeasurable, ruthless naval artillery fire will be brought to bear on the Communists – those beasts who harm the free lives of the Chinese people.

The artillery fire rang out as enthusiastically as firecrackers on the evening of the second day of this week when our land and sea forces entered the Wusong District to fight. The Communists used two armies to desperately cross the Liu River, and along Shizilin and Yuepu, used infiltration tactics, followed by human wave tactics, concentrating their firepower to destroy the land-based defending troops' bunkers and attacking Baoshan, Yanghang, and other places. Commander Ma Jizhuang's fleet, under these urgent circumstances, engaged the Communist army at the predetermined naval combat strongholds.

On the evening of May 13, Commander Ma Jizhuang received intelligence that the Communist army's 29th and 28th Armies were launching an all-out attack on Shizilin and Yuepu, wanting to capture Wusong within two days, destroy and break through the Shanghai outer defense fortifications, and cut off Shanghai's external water transportation. Commander Ma, based on this situation, issued combat orders at around 7:00, commanding warships that were originally patrolling the Baimaisha area to attack Shizilin and Liu River, while simultaneously dispatching warships from Wusong to join the warships operating at Liu River and Shizilin, using a dense barrage of artillery fire to suppress the enemy, so that the attacking Communist army was completely unable to advance under the strong naval firepower blockade, and using the main guns to intercept Communist reinforcements. The battle continued until 12:00 AM. The Communists, regardless of life and death, still attempted to take advantage of the darkness, using human wave tactics to advance towards Shizilin and Yuepu. As their attack became more intense, our artillery fire became even more fierce. At dawn on the 14th, the bandits regrouped a division, with more than forty large and small artillery pieces attached, and launched a third fierce attack. Relying on the hard fighting of the land-based defending troops, our navy used annihilating firepower to sweep the area fiercely. After dawn, the Communist army's fighting spirit completely declined.

I went to General Gui Yongqing's headquarters. According to combined land and sea military reports, in the fierce battle last night, the enemy suffered more than six thousand casualties. Under the strong artillery suppression of the navy, in the Tianduzhai area, more than two thousand bandits were completely annihilated.

The navy's artillery fire was not only fierce, but the impact points of the shells were also 100% accurate.

"This is the prelude to the first victory," Ma Jizhuang told me. This prelude opened up the foundation for the victory of the Shanghai Defense Battle. From the 12th to the 17th, the Communist army repeatedly attacked Yuepu, Yanghang, Niujiaojian, and Shidongkou continuously, and our navy continuously supported the army in turn, using relentless artillery fire to suppress the enemy, constantly keeping the Communist army from raising its head, and maintaining a strong fire attack record.

Commander Ma Jizhuang told me that his confidence in the Shanghai Defense Battle came from the strong leadership of Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing, "Only success is allowed, failure is not." General Ma Jizhuang led his fleet in this realm, burying himself in the struggle. On the evening of the 14th, another crazy offensive by the bandit army came. The first-line bunkers in Yuepu were completely captured using the highest record of "dead men." Under these urgent circumstances, the navy did not consider the consequences of the battle in this defense zone. Commander Gui ordered Commander Ma to personally lead the "Taihe" and "Yongjing" warships to attack, launching a thorough, devastating bombardment of the bandit army in Tangwan, Xinzhen, Niujiaojian, and other places. Within a few hours, the army completely restored those lost bunkers, maintaining the original situation of the defense zone. When they were bombarding fiercely, dozens of enemy shells landed near the warships, "But fortunately, not a single shell hit," Commander Ma Jizhuang told me afterwards.

Then Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo called, expressing his commendation for their – the navy's – attacking spirit and the brilliant results they had achieved. In the afternoon, General Tang personally went to Commander Ma Jizhuang's flagship to offer his condolences, and in person rewarded all the officers and soldiers of the Ma Jizhuang fleet with twenty thousand silver dollars.

Commander Ma Jizhuang, a naval major general, a sturdy man, a graduate of the third class of the Qingdao Naval Academy, a typical northerner, in his forties, is a young naval general with a strong will. He was full of confidence in leading the fleet to defend Shanghai this time, and also felt incomparably honored.

Commander Ma Jizhuang told me that the Communist army's attacking methods this time were completely within his expectations, so he calmly and leisurely wrote down the record of this first victory. "How did you deal with the enemy?" I asked Commander Ma Jizhuang, who was the chief of staff of this fleet before taking on the role of commander.

"Very simple," he said. "The enemy's offensive is constant, and it is usually at 8:00 PM, 12:00 AM, and dawn the next day." He continued to point out his countermeasures: "My fleet's principle of use is to control in a safe zone, concentrate and launch fierce attacks." This is also the tactical principle he adopted. This tactic, in the army, is called short-range fire, and it belongs to the category of lightning-like assault tactics. In World War II, the Americans used this tactic to defeat Hitler.

The Navy's position in the Shanghai Defense Battle, compared to the severe environment of the Yangtze River Defense Battle, where they were attacked on both sides, is not comparable. In Shanghai, this open river surface close to the sea is sufficient to further demonstrate the navy's power and allow it to express its strengths even more. Colonel Liu Guangkai gave many valuable opinions in this regard. Colonel Liu is a fleet captain famous for his main guns, and he is a major general in the Ma Jizhuang fleet.

Due to these factors above, the navy's morale is soaring!

Under the close cooperation of the land, sea, and air forces, and under the navy's continuous artillery fire, the Communists have encountered strong resistance and failed in the Wusong defense zone. The bandit's 28th and 29th Armies have been routed. The fierce battles of the past five days are coming to an end. In the Yuepu and Yanghang area, the Communist Party has completely declared its failure.

The Communist Party is trying to avoid the navy's artillery fire and find another attack target. On May 16, they concentrated 30,000 people, shifted their target, and attacked Yuepu, using their consistent human wave tactics to launch a deep assault, bringing our × unit into his encirclement. Unfortunately, they were destroyed again by our navy's dense and fierce artillery fire. As long as the navy's artillery firepower can reach it, the Communist bandits' offensive against Shanghai will forever be immersed in death and failure. (Xie Yongyan)

### Four Battle Heroes Receive Honorary Treatment

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] According to a spokesman for the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, "Yesterday morning, four more battle heroes from a certain unit of our armored vehicles were driven to the Hero Hall of the International Hotel to receive honorary and generous treatment. The first was Sergeant Squad Leader Shao Mingfu, who killed dozens of bandits with machine gun fire in the West Lane Battle on the 12th of this month. The second was Sergeant Squad Leader Zhao Changyu, who continuously shot and killed bandits with a submachine gun in the same battle, and threw grenades with one hand, killing many bandits. The third was Sergeant Squad Leader Xu Wenxi, who operated a heavy machine gun and swept fiercely at the stubborn bandits, killing many bandits and refusing to retreat despite being wounded. The fourth was Third-Class Road Worker Sun Zhenzhou, who, at about 10:00 PM during the battle, had more than ten bandits rush towards our tank. The soldier was not afraid of danger and threw many grenades, killing the attacking bandits, causing the tank to escape disaster. The above four brave and skilled heroes are the models for our soldiers defending Greater Shanghai. Every one of our soldiers should follow the example of these four heroes. If every fighter can fully display their combat power like these four heroes, the defense of Greater Shanghai will definitely be foolproof. In addition to providing three days of accommodation and meals, the Jinghu-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters will also issue generous慰勞品 (consolation items)."

### Air Force Assists in Battles All Day on Wusong and Pudong Lines

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] The Shanghai Defense Battle entered its eighth day on the 19th. Fierce battles unfolded throughout the day on the Wusong District and Pudong District lines. The weather was bad on the 19th, with rain clouds hanging low over the four suburbs of Shanghai. To support the army, the air force risked flying all day,穿雲上下(going up and down through the clouds) in the Wusong and Pudong districts, searching for the Communist army's positions and the Communist army units fighting against our army to bomb and strafe them. The battle results were as follows:

(1) Bombed and strafed several Communist army artillery positions in Linjiazhai, Wangjiawan, southwest of Gaoqiao in the Pudong District, and Gujiazhai, southeast of Gaoqiao, killing and wounding over one hundred Communist army soldiers, supporting the army's battle in Donggouzhen, killing and wounding hundreds of Communist army soldiers.

(2) Destroyed several artillery positions in Wujiazhai, southeast of Yuepu, Qiaobanqiao, north of Liuhang, and northwest of Yanghang, supporting the army's battle in Yijiaqiao and Jinjiaqiao near Liuhang, killing and wounding over one hundred Communist army soldiers.

(3) Bombed and killed over one hundred Communist army soldiers in Chenjiazhai, west of Liu River, and destroyed a total of forty Communist army wooden boats in the rivers from Kunshan to Luodian and near Luodian.

(4) Sniped at over one thousand Communist army troops traveling along the railway from Jiaxing and Hangzhou.

(5) On the 18th, the Communist army in the Pudong District used many anti-aircraft guns to fire into the air. Our planes flew low all day for combat. A few planes were hit, but fortunately there were no losses.

### National Army Arrives in Shanghai in a Steady Stream to Strengthen Defense Forces

Remarks by Director Mao of the Municipal Police Bureau

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Since the Shanghai Defense Battle began, in order to cooperate with wartime necessities, Director Mao Sen of the Municipal Police Bureau has been working more than eighteen hours every day, only returning to his residence to rest at 2:00 AM at night. Mao told reporters last night that, according to what he knew, strong national army forces are now arriving in Shanghai from a certain place in a steady stream to strengthen the defense battle force. This is enough to show the government's determination to defend Shanghai, and to fight until the final victory.

### Li Guiliang Executed by Firing Squad in Wusong for Colluding with the Enemy

[Central News Agency, Naval Headquarters dispatch] Since the Communist bandits' rebellion, they have felt the great impact of our navy and have used various despicable means to try to divide the naval force. Two weeks ago, when our ×× warship was sailing in a certain area, it was discovered that Petty Officer Li Guiliang had been enticed by the bandits to collude with the enemy and rebel. He was arrested and, after a rigorous interrogation and investigation by this headquarters, the facts were verified. At 9:00 AM on the 19th, he was handed over to the First Military Region and executed by firing squad at Paotaiwan in Wusong, in order to serve as a warning.

### Song Ziwen Leaves India for Belgium

[United Press, Calcutta, 18th] Song Ziwen, former President of the Executive Yuan of China, left here with his wife on the 18th to fly to Brussels, and then to Paris. According to an attendant, Song's trip abroad is for rest.

### Transportation between Hong Kong and Tianjin Restored

[United Press, Hong Kong, 19th] The Hong Kong government announced that transportation between Hong Kong and Tianjin has been restored.

### Responsible Person of the Kuomintang Said: The Government Is Determined to Fight to the End; Those Who Advocate Compromise Midway Will Be Punished as Rebels

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 19th] According to a responsible person of the Kuomintang, since the Communist bandits brazenly disregarded the public opinion of the whole country on April 21, broke the peace talks, and launched a military operation to cross the river, the government, in order to fulfill its duty to defend the country and protect the people, decided to fight the Communist bandits to the end and never compromise again. This can be seen from the four points decided by President Chiang, Acting President Li, and President He in Hangzhou, and from the announcements issued successively by President Chiang and the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. However, recently, spies in the rear have continued to spread rumors, saying that there are still government officials who advocate reopening peace talks. Especially in the past week, because the Communist army in Jiangxi and Fujian provinces took the opportunity to advance while our military was deploying, the rumors have become more prevalent, saying that the government is considering withdrawing from Guangzhou and moving the capital to a certain place in the southwest. For a time, there was風雨(wind and rain) throughout the city, and people were panicked. The Central Committee has also heard of the above rumors, so recently there have been two resolutions aimed at this kind of spy propaganda: First, since the national policy has been determined, no one is allowed to advocate peace talks again. The Central Executive Committee has issued an order to all party members, and the government has issued an order to all levels of civil and military officials and the people, that anyone who advocates compromise midway or妄發表(rashly publishes)求和(peace-seeking)言論 will be punished as a rebel. Second, the government has a responsibility to defend the territory, and all areas currently controlled by the government should strengthen their defenses. Southern China is where the government is located, and the military authorities should step up deployments to ensure it. These two resolutions can show the government's determination to fight the Communist bandits to the end and that there is absolutely no intention of compromising midway or abandoning the rear base. However, as the war is spreading more and more and the situation is becoming increasingly tense, the people in the rear who are not fighting should order them to not contradict their determination to fight to the end, but rather to complement each other.

(9) Import and export goods with a value of less than US$25 or its equivalent are not subject to the restrictions of these measures. (10) These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

It is also learned that after the trade system is revised, the original Administrative Yuan Import and Export Management Committee will be abolished, and some of its business will be handled separately by the Central Bank and the customs.

### Forward Line at Yuepu (Continued)

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Shi Zhi

According to the custom among domestic journalists on the front lines, except during periods of quiet in the fighting when there might be occasional visits to the front lines, based on this trip, reaching Wusong should have been considered a complete fulfillment of the task. This is because, firstly, accurate war reports could be obtained here, and secondly, from here to Yuepu via the main road is eighteen Chinese miles, and to Yanghang is twelve Chinese miles. If taking the small roads, the former is only fifteen Chinese miles, and the latter is only ten Chinese miles, all within the effective range of the Communist army's mountain artillery, not to mention field artillery and heavy artillery. However, at that time, a sense of curiosity and confidence in the strong fighting power of Liu Yuzhang's troops drove us to risk our lives, completing a perilous journey unprecedented in our lives.

When we departed from Wusong, our equipment was strengthened. In addition to Chief Wang's self-defense revolver, we added a Browning pistol from the Political Warfare Department Chief Dai Longshan of a certain division, and a carbine from another political warfare officer. We proceeded north from Wusong along the Wubao (Mountain) Highway. After about twenty minutes, we turned west onto an ancient road. The mud road was rugged and extremely bumpy. As the jeep twisted and turned to a certain place, Chief Dai pointed to three tiled houses ahead and told me that this was the division headquarters of a certain division.

It was exactly 12:50 PM. Division Commander Guo Yong had already gone to the regimental headquarters to direct the battle. After Staff Officer Yang Jingbin gave a brief report on the situation and we took photos, we continued to move forward. Just as the jeep drove in front of a tiled house in front of the division headquarters, we encountered a truck loading artillery shells. The brothers on the truck knew that we were going to the regimental headquarters and reported to Chief Dai that the public road near the airfield was too dangerous due to the density of the Communist artillery shells, and it would be best to wait until their truck had finished loading the ammunition and then take another route to bypass it for safety. Because we were anxious to get on the road quickly, we suggested that Chief Dai ask the division's transport unit to send a soldier as a guide. Under the direction of the guide, we twisted and turned northwest again. Sure enough, soon, the vehicle drove onto a highway filled with fine stones and broken bricks, overgrown with weeds, intended for repair but not yet officially paved. All along the way, we only heard dense machine gun fire and bursts of artillery fire from the Nationalist artillery positions behind us.

Suddenly, the road ahead opened into a fork pointing northwest. The brother acting as a guide immediately ordered the driver to take the fork and proceed at "maximum speed." At this time, the machine gun and artillery fire from the front line became even more intense. Due to the rugged terrain and excessive speed, not only did my head hit the roof of the vehicle several times, causing severe pain, but I was also nearly thrown out of the vehicle several times. By this point, everyone's nerves had been stretched to the highest level, hoping the vehicle would quickly take us to our destination. Little did we know that shortly after the vehicle entered the fork, many artillery sounds suddenly came from behind the vehicle. These sounds seemed to originate only five or six meters behind the vehicle and consistently maintained the same distance from the vehicle. I knew this was bad and asked Chief Dai which side was firing the artillery. Dai replied, "Yes, we are firing our own artillery at the enemy!" Everyone felt relieved, and the vehicle continued to speed forward, with the artillery sounds never ceasing behind us. Suddenly, an artillery shell landed about three or four meters to the right front of the vehicle, followed by another shell dropping about five or six meters to the left front. Due to the heavy rain yesterday, the shells landed in the wet wheat field, only creating dense black smoke plumes reaching about ten feet high and wide. At this time, everyone realized that the initial artillery sounds were not from our own Nationalist army but were from the Communist army, which had mistakenly identified our jeep as carrying high-ranking commanders and was carrying out a planned pursuit of it. In a hasty moment, we immediately braked, and regardless of the mud, everyone scattered and crawled into the wheat field. Subsequently, about three to six or seven meters apart, four more artillery shells landed around us, to the left, right, front, and back. As I lay in the wheat field, I thought: I can only "leave it to fate"!

About ten minutes later, the sound of an engine slowly approached from afar and was circling back and forth hundreds of meters above us to the due west. The Communist army's artillery fire then ceased. I quickly got up and walked to the vicinity of the machine gun position about twenty meters north of the road, where I saw a squad of brothers calmly continuing to dig soil and add mud, building fortifications. At this time, in addition to immediately ordering the driver to turn the vehicle around and drive east to a safe area, we no longer had the courage to continue forward. However, we couldn't resist the encouragement of Chief Dai and Chief Wang: "The regimental headquarters is only two hundred meters ahead. Let's go there to rest before we talk about it." (To be continued)

### Editorial: Today's Shanghai Municipal Administration

The flames of war are gradually shifting eastward, already burning on the outskirts of Shanghai. The sound of artillery roars day and night. Although the citizens are able to maintain calm and continue their lives as usual, the anxiety and worry in their hearts are ultimately impossible to conceal. This place and time are no longer comparable to the Shanghai of the past. Therefore, when speaking of today's Shanghai municipal administration, one feels a sense of being overwhelmed with countless strands and unable to know where to begin. Mayor Chen issued a "Letter to the Citizens of Shanghai" on the 17th, putting forward eight points: (1) Life first, food for the people first; (2) Security first, stability first; (3) Support the war effort, military-civilian unity; (4) Maintain production, labor-management cooperation; (5) Reform politics, eliminate corruption; (6) Stabilize the economy, eliminate speculation; (7) The world as one family, Chinese-foreign cooperation; (8) Expert politics, build Shanghai. All these key points are indeed the urgent priorities for Shanghai today, but they require the municipal government to implement them effectively.

Originally, after former Mayor Wu left Shanghai, many of the responsible personnel in each bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government also successively resigned. As a result, there were many acting officials, even acting after acting, which can be said to have meant no one truly responsible, merely勉强应对,敷衍门面吧了. When Mayor Chen took office at the beginning of the month, the first thing he felt was that personnel were unstable and government affairs were stagnant. The second was social unrest and the people's livelihood was difficult. Indeed, these are two serious problems in Shanghai's current municipal administration. Therefore, before the 10th of this month, personnel in each bureau were gradually adjusted, and the newly appointed directors of the social, financial, educational, public utilities, and civil affairs bureaus had all taken office. On the one hand, in order to solve the coal shortage, it was decided to exchange flour and cloth for Taiwanese coal. On the other hand, in order to prevent a food shortage, it was planned to requisition civilian supplies and purchase foreign food. After half a month, the municipal administration has gradually returned to normal.

As the saying goes, "To govern well, one must first obtain good people." After Mayor Chen took office, he immediately addressed the problem of the reduced supply of non-staple foods such as pork and vegetables for the citizens, advocating the substitution of fish for meat and promoting vegetable cultivation on gardens and rooftops. Furthermore, to gather wisdom and expand ideas, in addition to the existing people's representative body, the Municipal Council, he will also hire university presidents, experts, and others to establish a municipal advisory group to participate in research and design work. All of this shows the government's thorough consideration and eagerness to govern well.

However, today's Shanghai is in the midst of turmoil, with chaos everywhere: chaotic laws, chaotic finances, chaotic social order. It is indeed a situation of countless strands, requiring提纲挈领,以简驭繁. It is certainly impossible to relax and leisurely decorate things太　; nor is it necessary to盡饼充饥,徙尚空谈; time does not allow for leisurely plans. What the citizens are currently hoping for from the municipal government is very simple: simply to seek truth from facts in stabilizing society, stabilizing the economy, and calming people's hearts, in order to maintain their lives and ensure their survival. The "Shepherd's People" chapter of Guanzi says: "Those who know the times can be established as leaders, and those who are selfless can be placed in government." If the current government can actively "know the times" and passively "be selfless," then all difficult problems can be easily solved.

Stabilizing society begins with maintaining social order. With the sound of artillery roaring in the suburbs, people's hearts will naturally be restless and fearful. At this time and in this place, not only must there be no chaos, but there must also be order and stability as usual. Water, electricity, and transportation must be protected thoroughly and maintained normally. Schools must continue to hold classes as usual; government offices must continue to operate as usual; hospitals must continue to provide medical services as usual. Other matters, such as the tidiness of streets and city appearance, the management of vendors, the apprehension of criminals, and the prevention of bandits and fires, must be given increased attention everywhere.

Stabilizing the economy begins with maintaining production. Factories in the urban area that have suspended work should be assisted in resuming work immediately. Shops that have closed should be persuaded to reopen immediately. Markets that have stagnated should resume trading immediately. The stability of currency value is the most important task. As for calming people's hearts, it begins with reforming politics. Mayor Chen and the newly appointed directors of each bureau are all "taking orders in times of crisis," bravely taking responsibility and not being perfunctory in the face of difficulties, which has led Shanghai's municipal administration, facing artillery fire, on the road to reform. If they can act with great benevolence, wisdom, and courage, and act as Xie An, who remained calm while playing chess during the battle, leading all public servants and teachers in the city to work calmly, "If the leader is upright, who would dare to be corrupt?" The citizens' minds will naturally follow suit and become calm.

In addition, matters such as providing relief to refugees, comforting displaced persons, raising the salaries of public servants and teachers, thoroughly eliminating corruption, cutting redundant organizations, and enhancing administrative efficiency are all urgent priorities. Time is pressing. Current policies must be implemented quickly and effectively. What is meant by "fast" is to do what is said. What is meant by "having a solution" is to do what is said. There must be no procrastination and no leaks. Those in power must not only be incorruptible officials but also capable officials, because the most pressing tasks are stability, stabilization, and tranquility. As for substituting fish for meat, planting vegetables on rooftops, and establishing advisory groups, those are secondary.

### United Nations General Assembly Adjourns: Issue of Former Italian Colonies to be Discussed at September Session

[United Press Fuller's Xing, 18th] The United Nations General Assembly adjourned at 6:17 PM today.

[US News Agency, Fuller's Xing, 18th] The Third United Nations General Assembly adjourned tonight and will reconvene in the fall. At the close of this session, Secretary-General Trygve Lie told delegates: "The hope for peace has become brighter, and the strong belief in the United Nations is the strongest it has been in a long time." The Indonesian issue has been postponed for discussion to avoid affecting the ongoing Dutch-Indonesian negotiations in Batavia under the auspices of the United Nations. In addition, the draft convention on freedom of information was also postponed until the fall session, as there was insufficient time to discuss it during this session. The Fourth UN General Assembly is scheduled to open on September 20th.

[United Press Fuller's Xing, 18th] The United Nations concluded its Third General Assembly on the 18th. The 59-nation assembly today rejected the Bevin-Sforza proposal for the disposition of former Italian colonies. By a vote of 51 to zero, it resolved to postpone further discussion of the colonial issue to the Fourth General Assembly in September. As Assembly President Evatt prepared to adjourn the meeting, the Polish representative requested a debate on the case of German Communist Eisler, seeking UN intervention in his escape. Evatt denied permission, arguing that with the General Assembly about to adjourn, it was not practically possible to discuss the matter. The matter was put to a vote, upholding the Assembly President's ruling.

[French News Agency Rome, 18th] The United Nations General Assembly's rejection of the Bevin-Sforza plan for handling the former Italian colonies has greatly disappointed people here. While political figures hope for a more favorable solution for Italy when the issue is discussed at the next General Assembly, authorities here believe that the hostile attitude of some member states of the Assembly towards returning colonies to Italy is extremely serious. Italian newspapers have not commented on the matter.

[French News Agency London, 18th] British government officials here expressed regret over the United Nations General Assembly's rejection of the Bevin-Sforza plan, but a Foreign Office spokesman said that Britain is prepared to accept any solution passed by the United Nations.

### Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference: Tentative Agreement Expected; US, UK, and France Engaged in Secret Consultations

[Associated Press Paris, 19th] Well-informed sources said today that at the upcoming Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the US, UK, and France will establish a tentative agreement with the Soviet Union on the German question, without hoping for a permanent solution.

According to the planned proposal, a German Committee will be established as a liaison mechanism between the West German government and the East German People's Council to symbolize German unification, pending genuine cooperation between East and West. US Envoy Jessup and State Department Advisor Bohlen, British Foreign Office expert Sir Gilbert Laithwaite, and French Foreign Office Secretary-General Parodi have been engaged in secret consultations on this matter in recent days.

[Reuters Paris, 18th] The representatives of the three powers continued their talks here today before the convening of the Foreign Ministers Conference to seek to unify the steps of the three Western countries in the Foreign Ministers' Conference. British Commander-in-Chief in Germany General Robertson and the advisor to the French Commander-in-Chief in Germany, Poncet, also participated in the talks.

[French News Agency Moscow, 19th] The Soviet delegation to the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference will include Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, Commander-in-Chief of Soviet Forces in Germany Marshal Chuikov, and senior officials of the Soviet Foreign Ministry Smirnov and Podtserobov. Smirnov participated in the 1947 Moscow Conference and last year's Berlin problem delegation. There are also seven advisors, two experts, thirteen diplomats, and forty-six other personnel, for a total of more than seventy people. Foreign Minister Vyshinsky's wife and two journalists will also travel to Paris at the same time, and twelve secretaries have already flown from here to Paris.

[French News Agency London, 18th] It was announced here today that Foreign Minister Bevin will leave here on Friday for Paris to hold preliminary talks with French Foreign Minister Schuman and US Secretary of State Acheson before the convening of the Foreign Ministers Conference.

[French News Agency Paris, 18th] Representatives and experts on German affairs from the UK, US, and France continued their preparatory meetings at the French Foreign Ministry this afternoon, but no information was released on the discussions.

### Canada Recognizes Israel

[French News Agency Ottawa, 18th] It was announced here today that the Canadian government has formally recognized Israel. Canada had already given de facto recognition to Israel in December last year.

### Soviet Union Restricts Cars from Entering Soviet Zone of Berlin

US Believes It's Another Indirect Blockade

[Associated Press Berlin, 18th] The Soviet Union today restricted cars from entering Berlin and the Soviet zone. West Germans believe this is due to the devaluation of the Soviet zone Mark, and the US also believes this is an indirect blockade. At the same time, the four-power negotiations on easing trade and transportation seem to have broken down. All of this has occurred one week after the lifting of the Berlin Blockade. US Military Government transportation expert Dix has gone to Helmstedt to investigate the truth about 150 West German trucks being blocked at the Soviet border. According to official reports, Soviet soldiers suddenly demanded that all vehicles present permits issued by the East German Economic Commission, and the Soviets also demanded control over all exports from West Berlin. US officials say this is a sign that a subtle blockade has restarted, aimed at forcing the US, UK, and France to only maintain military delegations in Berlin, with all raw materials supplied by the Soviet Union.

### Soviet Union to Rejoin Allied Government of Berlin

[Reuters Berlin, 18th] British officials here believe that the Soviet Union may soon return to the four-power Allied Military Government of Berlin. The Soviet Union withdrew from that body last summer. British officials expect that the first step the Soviet Union will take will be to send an observer to attend, but the personal attendance of Major General Kotikov, the Soviet Commander of the Berlin District, is also not impossible.

### Soviet Newspaper Emphasizes That Goodwill Cooperation Among Four Nations Is a Primary Condition for Peace; This Path of Cooperation Will Be Obtained at the Foreign Ministers Conference

[Reuters Moscow, 19th] The Moscow New Times weekly commented: Cooperation among the great powers is the primary condition for lasting peace, and the path to rebuilding this cooperation is now very clear. If the upcoming Foreign Ministers Conference on the German issue is to be successful, the Western countries must abandon their methods of intimidation and arbitrariness. The rapid drafting of the Bonn Constitution and the hasty establishment of a provisional West German government are quite suspicious. It should be known that similar attempts to create a fait accompli will not benefit their authors, because everyone in the world knows that no political or international problem can be solved by war. At the upcoming Foreign Ministers Conference, both sides must act in good faith. The Berlin problem is an integral part of the German problem, and the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements are the foundation for resolving the German problem. The Soviet Union has always believed that the Berlin and German problems must be resolved through four-power negotiations.

### Developments in the Current Situation in Asia Seriously Threaten World Peace; Acheson Tells Reporters That He Is Extremely Concerned About China

[Reuters Washington, 18th] Secretary of State Acheson stated at his weekly press briefing today that the United States is not currently considering joining a Pacific defense pact. However, he acknowledged that in the situation in Asia, there exists a serious danger to world peace. When reporters asked him to elaborate on the points of serious danger, Acheson said that his concerns were mainly centered around the troublesome situation in China.

Regarding the Pacific pact issue, he said, "I believe that those who have put forward this suggestion have probably not studied the evolution and development of the North Atlantic Treaty. The creation of the Atlantic Treaty was due to a series of circumstances unique to Europe and the Atlantic Treaty countries, so the treaty was a logical result of a series of developments." He said, "Although there is a serious danger to world peace existing in the situation in Asia, as Nehru said, a Pacific pact will be difficult to form until the existing disputes within Asia are resolved, due to these internal disputes. Therefore, the time is not yet ripe to organize a Pacific pact along the lines of the Atlantic Treaty." Acheson said that Nehru's views were an objective assessment of current practical possibilities.

### No Concessions Will Be Made on the West German Issue

[French News Agency Washington, 18th] Secretary of State Acheson told reporters here today that the Western countries will not make any concessions on the West German issue at the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference. The Secretary of State insisted that the agreement between the UK, US, and France on Germany will not be the subject of dispute at the four-power Foreign Ministers Conference. He agreed with General Clay's statement yesterday, also advocating that the occupying forces should continue to be stationed in Germany. He said that the Soviet Union's willingness to negotiate is only intended to temporarily calm the Cold War. Acheson confirmed that he will immediately meet with the Foreign Ministers of the UK and France upon arriving in Paris to provide a comprehensive overview of various issues before the convening of the four-power Foreign Ministers Conference.

### Korean Foreign and Defense Ministries Issue Statement Requesting US Military Aid, Alleging Soviet Union Is Arming North Korean Army and Air Force

[Associated Press Seoul, 19th] The South Korean Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry issued a joint statement today, requesting active military aid from the United States. It is claimed that the Soviet Union has agreed to arm nine divisions of the North Korean army and loan North Korea 220 aircraft and 20 patrol boats. Currently, the strength of the North Korean army is approximately 200,000, while South Korea only has 50,000. The aid provided by the United States to South Korea should be at least equal to that provided by the Soviet Union to North Korea. South Korea should be adequately protected before US troops withdraw from South Korea.

[Associated Press Seoul, 19th] The Foreign Minister of the Republic of Korea openly requested the United Nations Commission on Korea at a special press conference on the 19th to clarify its position on rumors that the commission was planning to negotiate Korean unification with the North Korean People's Government.

### Japanese Financial Difficulties Lead to Resignation of Over Two Thousand Mayors

Two Village Chiefs Commit Suicide

[Associated Press Tokyo, 19th] The Mainichi Shimbun reports that according to investigations, over two thousand mayors and leaders of Japan's 16,000 local governments have resigned one after another due to extreme financial difficulties. It is claimed that this is caused by the new financial measures for local governments to be self-sufficient, which is a serious blow to MacArthur Headquarters' promotion of developing local self-governing bodies to match Japan's democratization. The newspaper claims that two village chiefs in Okayama Prefecture in western Honshu committed suicide because they were unable to perform their duties. It also claims that one of the prominent reasons for the widespread resignation of local government leaders is their inability to meet public demands to establish a new school system with six years of elementary school, three years of middle school, and three years of high school.

### US Loses Uranium Block; Part of It Has Been Found

This Mysterious Incident Is Gradually Subsiding

[French News Agency Washington, 18th] The Atomic Energy Commission issued a statement today stating that part of the thirty-two grams of Uranium-235 that was considered lost has been found in the laboratory's waste pile, so this "mysterious incident" that has caused people to feel extremely tense is gradually subsiding. The statement said that of the thirty-two grams of uranium that were lost, twenty-five grams have been found in the waste pile. The remaining seven grams may have been stolen or lost, and the federal police are continuing to search the waste pile.

[French News Agency Washington, 19th] Senator McMahon, Chairman of the Senate Atomic Energy Committee and a Democrat, claimed that the small amount of uranium lost from the atomic laboratory is of no value for manufacturing atomic weapons, and US security personnel do not believe this matter involves any espionage issues.

### South Alleges Hungarian Provocation; Border Guard Shot

[Reuters Belgrade, 19th] The Yugoslav government issued a formal statement today, accusing Hungary of attempting to provoke an incident against a socialist country.

### Halifax Urges British Government to Reconsider the Spanish Question; Upper House Unanimously Approves Atlantic Pact

[Reuters London, 18th] The British House of Commons approved the Atlantic Pact, and the House of Lords also unanimously approved the pact today. During the debate, former Foreign Secretary and wartime Ambassador to the US, Lord Halifax, urged the government to carefully reconsider the Spanish question so as to jointly induce Spain and the world to return to a more realistic path with the United States. First Lord of the Admiralty Hall replied on behalf of the government, stating that if the United Nations organization recognizes the Franco regime or resolves to send an ambassador to Madrid, then Britain will certainly comply.

### People of Madrid Oppose Screening of "Arch of Triumph"

[French News Agency Madrid, 19th] Last night, a crowd of about a hundred people paraded past the cinema screening the American film "Arch of Triumph," protesting the film's screening and tearing down the advertisements outside the theater.

### Three-Team Soccer Game Held in the Rain: Tung Wah and Tsing Pak Draw Again

The second act of the Three-Team Invitational Soccer Tournament, the match between Tung Wah and Tsing Pak, took place at Yi Garden yesterday at 4:30 PM. The weather was not cooperative in the afternoon, with drizzling rain, but about 2,000 fans still braved the rain to watch. The match proceeded as scheduled, but because the field was damp and Tung Wah only had ten players again, both sides agreed to change it to a friendly match. The result was a 1-1 draw. The match has been rescheduled for this weekend at 4:00 PM. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

Tung Wah

Zhang Banglun

Xie Xichuan, Wu Qixiang

Hannibal, Guan Yongchang

Li Yao, Gao Xiuqing, Han Longhai, Qian Jiuqing, Chen Mingzhe

Tsing Pak

Huang Shijie

Yan Shixin, Qiang Zhiyuan

Qian Changrong, Meng Yiliang, Fu Naidang

Jin Lusheng, Luo Shoufu, Liu Longxin, Liu Tiyin, Fei Chunhua

The match began in the drizzling rain. Tung Wah kicked off, with Han Longhai passing the ball. Gao Xiuqing advanced past defenders, but Tsing Pak's Fu Naidang failed to intercept properly, leaving a big gap. Unfortunately, Longhai's shot was too weak and did not succeed. The game remained even until the seventh minute when Tsing Pak launched a full attack. Jin Lusheng went straight in along the side and lofted a high ball into the box. Liu Longxin swept across the field, and Tsing Pak opened the scoring. At that time, the rain intensified, and the water battle between the two sides became fierce. Tung Wah struggled to break through, and Han Longhai made two surprise attacks, but both were cleared by Yan Shixin. In the 27th minute, Tung Wah launched another attack. Wu Qixiang advanced, but Meng Yiliang made a desperate save, resulting in a corner kick. Soon after, Qiang Zhiyuan joined Tsing Pak, bringing the team to the full complement of players, and their momentum increased. Fei Chunhua launched a sneak attack, but Luo Shoufu was unable to react in time, missing a good opportunity. The first half ended with Tsing Pak in the lead.

In the second half, Tung Wah still had only ten players, but their morale was not diminished. In the third minute, Tung Wah's Li Yao made a clever pass to Gao Xiuqing, who sprinted forward. Meng Yiliang handled the ball in the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick. Gao Xiuqing took the penalty, but missed. Tsing Pak seized the opportunity to attack, with Liu Tiyin and Liu Longxin attacking together, but Tung Wah's Hannibal cleared the danger. In the 19th minute, Tung Wah launched a comeback, with Li Yao and Gao Xiuqing pressing Tsing Pak closely. Qiang Zhiyuan became distracted and committed a handball foul, resulting in a penalty kick for Tung Wah. Han Longhai took the penalty and scored, tying the game at 1-1. After that, the two sides engaged in a fierce battle, with each team fighting for possession. Tung Wah was unwilling to be outdone, and Wu Qixiang once unleashed a powerful shot that was only inches from the post, giving Huang Shijie a scare. In the final three minutes, Tsing Pak's Jin Lusheng and Fei Chunhua attacked on both wings, and Tung Wah's defense suddenly became critical. Jin Lusheng went past Guan Yongchang and fired a powerful shot from close range, but Zhang Banglun made a save to clear the danger. Shortly afterward, time ran out, and each team had scored one goal, resulting in a satisfactory draw for both sides.

### The True Picture of Peace in Beiping

(Continued from the first page of May 17)

(7) Celebrating "Liberation"

The Thirteen Articles of Peace were announced on the 22nd. On that day, the people of Beiping celebrated wildly from south to north, as mentioned above. Starting from the 24th, the pressure of prices increased day by day, robberies continued to occur, workers of various agencies demanded wages in groups, gangsters extorted money, the Secretary-General of the government Gao Wenbo was beaten, and Mayor Liu Yaozhang's home was robbed, barely escaping with his life. Workers of the tram company demanded 50,000 big heads within three days, otherwise they would set fire to the building. A series of threatening facts are too numerous to mention. As a result, the smiles of the people of Beiping disappeared, and most people returned to their original sophistication. During this period, although art troupes with men and women were always dancing the Yangko with three steps forward and one step back, singing "The East is Red, the sun rises, China produced Mao Zedong" at any time and place on the streets, most people appreciated it with the mood of watching monkeys, and it did not affect their emotions at all. February 1 finally arrived, and the joint organization announced its establishment, but it was silent and had no effect. Some people woke up from their dreams, and most people were still disappointed. Details will be described later.

On February 2, the Beiping Municipal People's Government received the "pseudo-municipal government" according to the People's Daily. Although Ye Jianying repeatedly emphasized in his speech that this was the establishment of the people's own government, which was completely different from the two previous transfers to He Siyuan and Liu Yaozhang, the people of Beiping believed that not a single person was elected by more than 2 million citizens, and Ye Jianying was the mayor. Now they say it is their own government, which is really a bit beyond their reach, especially since various threats have increased day by day due to the establishment of their own government. Therefore, although the municipal government staff gave a reluctant smile during the hearing, it was a bitter smile, a perfunctory smile, not a real smile.

On February 3, the night before the People's Liberation Army held the ceremony for entering Beiping, the Baojia chiefs ordered each household to send one person to gather at the Guangchang inside Qianmen to prepare for the welcome. Roll call would also be taken at that time. With guns in their hands, who would dare not go! Moreover, the people of Beiping had never seen what the People's Liberation Army was like. If you pulled a southern water buffalo on the street, many people would watch, let alone the People's Liberation Army who had been admired for a long time? Therefore, that day was really crowded with people, filling the streets. The American journalist Mu _, Ji Ang believed that the people of Beiping welcomed the People's Liberation Army with the mood of being conquered, which was indeed an insult to the people of Beiping. In fact, Beiping has been the capital since the Liao Dynasty, with thousands of years of history and nearly ten dynastic changes. Due to the tempering of history, the residents are sophisticated and more like British gentlemen. Except for the moment of life and death, they have never regarded themselves as characters on the stage. Therefore, this time welcoming the People's Liberation Army is more like watching than welcoming. It is better to say that they ran a cameo role themselves than to say that they watched a ceremony. However, this only refers to the real people. As for the art troupes formed by various communist parties, that is another matter.

This drama was performed as follows: The protagonist, the People's Liberation Army, entered the city in two ways at 10:00 AM. One way came from Fengtai and entered the city through Yong'anmen, and the other way came from Haidian and entered the city through Xizhimen. After converging, they turned south and went west from West Chang'an Street through Hepingmen to Guang'anmen. The grand procession lasted from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM. The front team had already exited Hepingmen, and the rear team was still crowding towards Yongdingmen and Xizhimen. Lin Biao, Luo Ronghuan, Nie Rongzhen, and Ye Jianying appeared on the Qianmen arrow tower at 9:30 AM with the smiles of victors. In this entry ceremony, the so-called Tower Hill Heroic Team led the way into Xizhimen, and the so-called Storm Team led the way into Yongdingmen. I went to visit outside Qianmen. At about 11:00 AM, the so-called Storm Team leading the way arrived at Zhushikou. The team was led by an armored vehicle, with one person waving a yellow axe and sickle and a red Soviet flag as a guide, followed by four red trucks with portraits of Mao Zedong and Zhu De and Soviet flags everywhere. The trucks were full of music teams, playing international songs very harshly. Behind them were armored vehicle teams, artillery teams, and tank teams. Each vehicle was decorated with a bright and eye-catching large Soviet flag, followed by cavalry and infantry. The uniforms of the officers and soldiers were all khaki, the same as the National Army, except that there was a missing national emblem on the hat. (To be continued)

### Twenty Passenger Planes Fly South Daily: Still Difficult to Meet Passenger Needs

[Reported by this newspaper] The battle to defend Shanghai has entered a climax, and the number of people leaving Shanghai has increased sharply in recent days, especially with extremely crowded passengers in the two airlines. From morning to night, Longhua Airport is crowded with people, and boxes and luggage are piled up in the waiting room, creating a chaotic scene. Evacuation passenger planes all fly in from South China, arriving and departing at any time, with no fixed schedule. Some passengers, after arriving at the airport in the early morning, often have to wait until evening before they can take off, and their anxiety is evident in their expressions. Some people who carry silver dollars out of the country are eager to exchange them for US dollars due to weight restrictions, exchanging eleven big heads for ten US dollars. Yesterday, China Airlines flew out 14 passenger planes, and Central Airlines flew out 6 passenger planes. The two companies have been flying about 20 flights a day for the past few days, carrying an average of about 600 to 800 passengers per day, which is still not enough to meet the needs.

### Social Affairs Bureau Formulates Five Measures for Workers' Living Expenses

[Reported by this newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau is checking the provisions of Article 7 of the "Provisional Guidelines for the Calculation of Salaries of Shanghai Employees in Extraordinary Times," and the minimum living expenses for workers during factory shutdowns or reduced work hours will be determined separately. The Social Affairs Bureau believes that the situation in various factories in the city is different. If uniform regulations are made, it may cause disputes. The bureau yesterday formulated five more flexible measures: (1) The minimum living expenses for workers during shutdowns or reduced work hours should be based on self-negotiation between labor and management. (2) Refer to Article 1 of the "Measures for the Payment of Living Expenses to Workers During Temporary Factory Shutdowns" of the Labor-Management Assessment Committee (if the factory is suddenly shut down due to force majeure, the living expenses for up to ten days will be paid at half of the original wages, and for more than ten days but less than one month, the living expenses will be paid at one-quarter of the original wages). (3) The calculation of living expenses should be in accordance with Article 1 of the "Provisional Guidelines for the Calculation of Salaries of Shanghai Employees in Extraordinary Times." The payment of living expenses should also be handled in accordance with Articles 4, 5, and 6 of the "Implementation Guidelines" of the same measures. (4) If there is no fixed basic salary for piecework, it should be calculated based on the average of the actual work income for the last three months and handled in accordance with the second type of regulations. (5) If labor and management fail to reach an agreement, they should submit it to the bureau for approval. The above measures will be reported by the Social Affairs Bureau to the Municipal Government and the Political Affairs Committee of the Garrison Headquarters for record and notified to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, and the General Labor Union for implementation.

### Silver Dollar Price: National Bank Posted Yesterday; 9.6 Million Gold Yuan Coupons per Coin

[Reported by this newspaper] The price of silver dollars was officially posted by the Central Bank at about 10:00 AM yesterday at 9.6 million gold yuan coupons per coin.

The Central Bank also issued the following news release for the silver dollar posting: It has been decided by the Political Affairs Committee of the Jing-Hu-Hang Garrison Headquarters that the Central Bank will post the price every day, and all exchange shops holding silver dollar exchange licenses should operate according to the Central Bank's posted price. The transaction fee is approximately 2% of the posted price. The selling price should not be more than 200,000 yuan higher than the posted price. The buying price should not be more than 200,000 yuan lower than the posted price. For example, if the Central Bank's posted price on May 19, 1938, is 9.6 million gold yuan coupons per silver dollar, the price for an exchange shop to sell one silver dollar should not exceed 9.8 million yuan, and the price for buying one silver dollar should not be less than 9.4 million yuan. The fee will be re-regulated when it must be changed in the future. This measure has been strictly implemented by the Police Department, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Gold Control Bureau by order of the Jing-Hu-Hang Garrison Headquarters.

Yesterday, the Central Bank's posted price was still far from the black market, so the buying and selling of general stores was still at a standstill. A few shops posted 9.0 million to buy and 10.5 million to sell, but when asked to buy from them, they replied that there was no incoming inventory. The whereabouts of silver dollar dealers on the road were erratic, and the market was chaotic and inconsistent.

Yesterday, the exchange rate of gold and silver was stable, with the exchange of different types of goods at 44/47, the exchange of one type of goods at 43/46, the exchange of two types of goods at 45/48, and the exchange of foreign silver dollars at 48/53, with some at 47/52. The exchange of gold and banknotes was still at 50 yuan and 53 yuan. The exchange of banknotes and silver shrank by another 20%, and the US dollar has been gradually lagging behind, with the exchange of one type of goods at 8.3 yuan and 8.8 yuan, the exchange of two types of goods at 8.7 yuan and 9.2 yuan, and the exchange of different types of goods at 8.5 yuan and 9.0 yuan. However, foreign silver dollars were still stable, still at 9.5 yuan and 10 yuan. The market for exchanging jewelry gold for silver dollars was stable, and stores posted foreign silver dollars at 48 and 53, and factory bars plus 2 yuan, at 50 yuan and 55 yuan.

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the silver coin market was still popular. Because the price of gold and banknotes was not low, more people were buying than selling. The 20-cent coin rose to 400,000 to 500,000, the 10-cent coin rose to 200,000 to 250,000, and the 5-cent coin was also quoted as high as 100,000 to 150,000, an increase of 50,000 compared to the previous day.

### National Bank Determines Proportional Distribution of Silver Dollars for Deposits in Banks and Money Shops

[Reported by this newspaper] The Central Bank yesterday resumed the method of distributing silver dollars for depositors who withdrew deposits from various banks and money shops. The distribution ratio is 10% silver dollars, 20% silver coins, 10% fixed-amount promissory notes, and 60% cash.

Recently, the Central Bank has been supplying as much cash as possible to various banks, bureaus, and commercial firms for the balance of deposits every other day, and also distributing fixed-amount promissory notes and silver coins to meet actual needs. However, the total amount of deposits that various banks, bureaus, and commercial firms have to pay is much larger than the funds deposited in the Central Bank, so they cannot pay depositors according to the percentage of silver coins issued by the Central Bank, which has caused many misunderstandings in the outside world.

Inventory of Silver Coins to be Reported for Record

It is learned that in order to take into account the facts, the Appropriation Committee of the Central Bank has stipulated that from now on, various banks, bureaus, and commercial firms should report the total amount of deposits and the amount of silver coins in their inventory to the Central Bank for record at the end of each business day. The payment of deposits on the next day will be based on the ratio of the silver coins in the inventory on the previous day, plus the number of silver coins that can be obtained from the Central Bank on the same day, to the total amount of deposits as the composition of the distribution of silver coins. If it is less than one silver coin, it will be paid in gold yuan coupons, and it will be publicly displayed outside the business counter for public knowledge. The Central Bank has notified the Silver Industry Association to inform various banks and money shops to follow this measure. It is also learned that banks and money shops must not violate the above measures under any pretext. The Shanghai Gold Control Bureau is closely monitoring the distribution of silver dollars to various banks and money shops by the Central Bank at any time. If there is any illegal profiteering, in addition to being ordered to allocate the full amount, the Jing-Hu-Hang Garrison Headquarters will also investigate.

### Public and Education Salaries and Allowances: Approved to Distribute Silver Dollars

[Reported by this newspaper] It is learned that public and education personnel are allowed to distribute a portion of silver dollars based on the market price of the day when paying salaries and allowances. The ratio will be determined by the Central Bank based on the actual situation.

### Gold Market Increasingly Active

Silver Shops Still Not Posting Gold Prices

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the gold market was extremely active due to rising gold prices reported from other cities, diverging greatly from the local market. People's confidence was strong, and with various favorable conditions, there was much positive sentiment. As usual, prices hit the upper limit, rising again to 6.636 billion, but with transactions scarce. Outside the exchange, the atmosphere was fervent, with peaks appearing one after another, and buying enthusiasm pervading. The morning opened at 6.3 billion, then 6.6 billion, and then surpassed the 7 billion mark, reaching as high as 7.2 billion and 7.5 billion. Around noon, due to the central bank not selling, the upward trend intensified, reaching a peak of 7.4 billion and 7.7 billion. The noon close was slightly lower at 7.1 billion and 7.4 billion. In the afternoon, due to heavy pressure from the authorities, sentiment softened, and prices once fell back to 6.8 billion and 7.1 billion, finally closing at 7 billion and 7.3 billion, an increase of another 1 billion compared to the previous day's result.

The off-exchange US dollar also rose step by step. The morning opened at 12.2 million and 12.7 million, once reaching as high as 14.8 million and 15.3 million. The noon close was 14 million and 14.5 million. In the afternoon, due to more floating supply, prices fell to 13.3 million and 13.8 million, finally closing at 13.5 million and 14 million, a further increase of 1 million.

Yesterday, silver shops still did not post prices for gold jewelry. According to Wu Pengnian, Chairman of the Silver Shops Association, the members of the association are experiencing sluggish business, with daily transactions of only about four or five taels, which is not enough to cover the large overhead expenses. Moreover, with gold prices rising daily, business is difficult. However, once the situation improves, they will be able to resume posting prices and trading at any time.

### Rice Prices Rise Excessively, Police Monitor the Market, Cooking Oil Stagnant

Under the leadership of the gold price surge, rice prices rose again. Furthermore, with the supply cut off and inventory dwindling, the price increase was particularly intense. In the North City market, white japonica rice, thin-husk rice, and Xiang rice all approached the 90 million mark, a sharp increase of 16 million, or more than 20%, compared to two days ago. In the South City market, white japonica rice was 88 million and thin-husk rice was 89 million, also an increase of 16 million each. Due to the excessive price increases in recent days, economic police officers were secretly monitoring transactions in the market yesterday.

Grains

Transactions were sluggish. Due to the high price of side dishes, soybeans sold exceptionally well on this street. Pinghu soybeans rose more than 10 million, and mung beans were also selling. Pudong vegetable mung beans were at 60 million. Although corn did not rise much, sesame seeds and peeled peanuts did not open for trading.

Flour

Market sentiment fluctuated, but compared to gold and silver, it was generally firm. Old vehicle flour was trading at 18 million today. The warship flour opened higher in the morning, but buying interest weakened midway, and it fell to 15 million at one point. At the close, retail investors bought on the dip, bringing it back to 15.56 million. Red Bee and Dafa were stable. Lilang foreign flour opened at 27.6 million in the afternoon.

### Cotton Yarn Prices High, Fabric Market Stalls

The cotton yarn market was ordinary yesterday, and sentiment was scattered. It was heard that prices in Guizhou and other places had fallen, so sales to the south became sluggish. However, due to the continued rise of financial assets outside the industry, although buying interest in coarse and fine yarn was weak, prices still rose. 42-count Blue Phoenix saw 255 million, up 48 million. 40-count and 32-count yarns each rose by about 400 million. 21-count Double Horse spot goods were trading at 161 million, up 32 million. 20-count yarns of various grades rose by 15 million to 30 million each. 16-count and below rose by 15 million to 30 million each.

### The Battle to Defend Shanghai Unfolds, Kuomintang Members Rise Up in Time, Chairman Fang Issues Letter to All City Party Members

[Central News Agency] In view of the unfolding battle to defend Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Party Department of the Kuomintang believes that party members should rise up in time and strive to defend Shanghai. Chairman Fang has issued a letter to all city party members, which is recorded below:

To all comrades in the city: Since the communists have used all their strength to invade this city, the Battle of Shanghai has entered its climax. Due to the strong morale of our front-line soldiers and the dedication of the three armies, the communists have suffered a serious blow over the past week and have achieved initial victories. This association, considering that our party comrades have always been influenced by the Three Principles of the People and take saving the country and the people as their responsibility, should take this extraordinary period as an opportunity to strengthen themselves, strive to be the first to go to the front lines, set an example for the people, and work together to defend Shanghai. Therefore, the following points are presented to all comrades in the city:

(1) Rescuing the Wounded: At the front lines, the war is fierce, and our brave soldiers are fighting valiantly and fearlessly. We should organize comrades and mobilize the people to quickly launch rescue work for those brave soldiers who are wounded or become ill while defending the country, so that the wounded soldiers can receive medical treatment as soon as possible.

(2) Eliminating Traitors and Clearing Out Spies: At a time when the front-line defense war is becoming increasingly fierce, it is inevitable that there are criminals and communist spies hiding in our city's suburbs, plotting to create disturbances and seizing opportunities for mischief in order to cooperate with the communist military offensive. In order to consolidate public security and resolutely defend Shanghai, all our comrades should secretly investigate and strictly report them, and be sure to thoroughly eliminate them in order to quell the source of the chaos and ensure safety.

(3) Consoling the Soldiers: Our front-line soldiers are fighting bloody battles, not only working hard for the country, but also enduring all kinds of hardships. Therefore, how to comfort the soldiers is an urgent matter. All our comrades should mobilize the citizens of the city to launch a large-scale and widespread fundraising campaign to comfort the soldiers, thereby encouraging morale and increasing the soldiers' determination to kill the enemy.

(4) Relieving Refugees: The outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai has directly affected our compatriots in the suburbs, who have been rendered homeless, stranded on the streets, without clothing or food, and in a very miserable situation. In addition to extending our warm sympathy to them, we should also actively launch fundraising efforts and find ways to provide relief to demonstrate the spirit of service of our party comrades.

The above points are just a few of the most urgent matters to be addressed. As for other actions to be coordinated with the military, such as wartime tasks such as guides, reconnaissance, and transportation, all require party comrades to promptly implement them, take action, adhere to the belief of certain victory, endure the current hardships, and go all out to win the final victory in the defense war. The matter is urgent, and time is pressing. All our comrades in the city should consider the difficulties of the party and the country, quickly rise up and work to save the party, save the country, save the people, and save themselves. This is the time! Let us encourage each other. Printed by the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Kuomintang of China.
