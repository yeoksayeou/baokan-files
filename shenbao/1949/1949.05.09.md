### Presidential Decree Encouraging the Nation to Complete the Great Task of Stabilizing the Country and Quelling the Rebellion; Unity of Purpose to Save the Nation from Peril

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th] The President issued a decree on the 8th, encouraging military and government personnel at the central and local levels, as well as people's representatives at all levels, to rise up together, unite in purpose, adhere to their positions, and assist the government in completing the great task of stabilizing the country and quelling the rebellion. The full text of the decree is recorded below: "For years, the ravages of war have not ceased. Wherever the fighting reaches, resources are often squandered, cities are turned into ruins, and the people are displaced, starving and wandering the roads, with cries of resentment filling the land. We Chinese people are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor. Although there may be differences in party affiliation and political views, our national interests should be the same. However, after the victory of the War of Resistance, when the whole country urgently needed to recover, we are still fighting each other, brothers against brothers, which is more heartbreaking than anything else! The government, mindful of the difficulties of the nation and the suffering of the people, has advocated peace for four months, seeking compromise in every possible way. It was hoped that we could be open and honest with each other, making concessions for the sake of the country. However, the Chinese Communists suddenly proposed their so-called eight articles and twenty-four clauses of the domestic peace agreement, with harsh conditions tantamount to forcing surrender, and even set a deadline for signing, not allowing for any room to maneuver. The government could not bear to see the foundation of constitutional democracy, which had just been laid, destroyed, and the people, already in dire straits, once again suffering a great calamity. Therefore, it reiterated its righteous position, hoping for a final consideration. However, the Chinese Communists, relying on their military strength, launched a forceful crossing of the Yangtze River while government representatives were still in Ping, stating that they would completely defeat the government forces. The government, finding that peace talks could not continue and that it was facing renewed attacks, had no choice but to order all central agencies still in Nanjing to move to Guangzhou immediately on April 11th. It also charged the military authorities with carefully planning, concentrating forces, shortening the defense line, and continuing to resist in self-defense to protect democracy, freedom, and national independence. During this period, Guangzhou will be the location of the government of the Republic of China. In addition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs having already notified the diplomatic missions of various countries in Beijing, this is hereby announced to the whole country. All the people of our country must know that this time the government is fighting to uphold the rule of law, the constitution, democracy, freedom, and national independence. The war was initiated by them, and the fault does not lie with us. We must carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages, clearly distinguish between right and wrong, rise up together, and assist the government in completing this great task of stabilizing the country and quelling the rebellion. All the loyal and brave soldiers of our country should redouble their efforts and strive for merit. It is especially hoped that all military and government personnel at the central and local levels, as well as people's representatives at all levels and mass organizations, can unite in purpose, adhere to their positions, cooperate sincerely, and strive to bring the people out of suffering and save the nation from peril. With a great responsibility before us, there is no turning back. May you all respectfully abide by this decree, saving the country and saving yourselves."

### Acting President Li Flies to Guangzhou; In a Written Statement, He Hopes the Chinese Communists Will Pull Back from the Brink; If They Still Believe in Force, He Resolves to Resist Firmly

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th] Acting President Li flew from Guilin to Guangzhou on the 8th at noon on a special "Chasing Clouds" plane, accompanied by Yan Xishan, Chen Jitang, and Zhu Jiahua, as well as legislators Li Tian and Zhou Tianxian, Huang Xuecun, Director of the Second Bureau of the Presidential Palace, Li Yang, Director of the Confidential Office, and Guan Zhongfang, Deputy Director of the Sixth Bureau. The Acting President's plane landed at Tianhe Airport at 1 PM, where central leaders and legislative and supervisory committee members, including Yu Youren, He Yingqin, Sun Ke, Tong Guanjian, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Chonghui, Chen Lifu, Li Wenfan, Li Zonghuang, Jiang Menglin, Liu Zhe, Hang Liwu, Xu Yongchang, Liu Gongyun, Yeh Kung-chao, Ma Chaojun, Chen Qingyun, Zheng Yanfen, Gu Zhutong, Huang Shao-ku, Zhang Fakui, Yu Hanmou, Xue Yue, Zhang Zhen, Tang Zong, Chen Kewen, Ni Jiongsheng, Yan Guofu, Qiu Changwei, Wang Qijiang, Yin Shuxian, Yang Youjiong, as well as Liu Shiyi, Director of the Third Bureau of the Presidential Palace, Xu Bensheng, Director of the Sixth Bureau, Zhu Huafeng, Chief of the Protocol Section, and more than two hundred others were there to welcome him. The atmosphere was very enthusiastic. After disembarking, Acting President Li shook hands with the welcomers one by one and inspected the honor guard, before driving to the guesthouse to rest. The Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters hosted a banquet this afternoon to welcome Acting President Li, and invited central leaders to accompany him.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th] After arriving in Guangzhou on the 8th at noon, Acting President Li issued a written statement saying:

"I left Beijing for a short stay in Guilin because I needed a rest after months of hard work. During my time in Guilin, I was deeply touched by the concern shown by my colleagues in the central, legislative, and supervisory branches, who repeatedly urged me to return. The government, concerned about the difficulties of the nation and the suffering of the people, and unable to bear the further destruction of war, resolved to sincerely seek peace. President Chiang, in order to promote peace, resolutely stepped down. His personal contributions to the country in the past, such as completing the Northern Expedition, resisting Japan, and abolishing unequal treaties, have left indelible achievements. This time, sacrificing his honor for the sake of the people, is a testament to his great benevolence and courage, and should be admired by the world. After taking office, I also believed that the conflict between brothers could be resolved through political means. Therefore, I decided to engage in sincere peace talks with the Chinese Communists, based on the government's consistent position. Unexpectedly, the conditions proposed by the Chinese Communists were too harsh for the government to accept. At the same time, disregarding the government's reply requesting further consideration, they forcibly crossed the Yangtze River and advanced on the capital. After the government withdrew from the capital, they continued to attack Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi. The government was forced to fight back in self-defense, causing the people of Jiangnan to suffer the horrors of war again, which is deeply regrettable. I, entrusted with the heavy responsibility by the nation and the people, have failed to eliminate the scourge of war and bring about peace and harmony. I am ashamed that my sincerity was not enough to move people, and I deeply regret this. At this time when the nation and the people are deeply wounded, even though the flames of war have been rekindled, based on my consistent belief, I still deeply hope that the Chinese Communists can pull back from the brink, prioritize the nation and the people, and change their attempt to conquer all of China by force, in order to fulfill the nationwide desire for peace. However, if the Chinese Communists still believe in force, are unwilling to repent, and insist on resolving everything through military means, then they initiated the war, and the fault does not lie with us. In order to protect national independence and democratic freedom, the government has no choice but to put up a strong resistance against this violent oppression. The responsibility for the war rests with them, and this should be understood by all our compatriots. As for the government, I believe that from now on, we must act with great enlightenment and understanding, eliminate all factionalism and selfishness, strive for sincere unity, so that the new forces of democratic progress can grow rapidly. With firm determination, we must thoroughly implement the advocacy of political reform, and eliminate past malpractices in order to reverse the decline and restore order. In short, from now on, I will lead the government to remove obstacles and make the greatest efforts to relieve the people of their suffering and to protect democracy, freedom, and national independence. I hope that all military and government personnel at all levels throughout the country will understand the difficulties of the times and the government's intentions, and fulfill their duties diligently and without slackening. Compatriots throughout the country should do their best to assist, so that we can jointly complete this arduous task of our time."

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th] The government spokesman said: After a short rest in Guilin, Acting President Li flew to Guangzhou at 1 PM on the 8th. After a short rest, he discussed important military and political issues with President He and other party, government, and military leaders. After 6:30 PM, he went to President He's residence to discuss everything. In recent days, there have been many rumors about the reason for Acting President Li's delay in coming to Guangzhou. In fact, these are all unfounded speculations and have no basis in fact. President Chiang, in his capacity as Director-General of the Kuomintang, leads the entire party in working closely with Acting President Li. The rumors that President Chiang will come to Guangzhou are also not true. All rumors will cease after Acting President Li returns to Guangzhou.

### North China Foreign Ships Halt

### National Army Achieves Great Victory in Qingdao Environs; Recovers Lingshan and Advances Rapidly Towards Pingdu; Communist Army Collapses, with 8,000 Deaths

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 8th] The four-day and night battle in the suburbs of Jimo has achieved a complete victory under the personal command of General Zhao Lin. The vanguard of the National Army has crossed Songhuaquan (25 li north of Jimo) and is continuing to pursue the fleeing bandits, who have collapsed and are in a state of panic. As of the time of this dispatch, more than 8,000 bandits have been killed, and one bandit division commander, one political commissar, and one regimental commander have been wounded. In the areas of Xiatuan and Songhuaquan alone, more than 2,300 bandit corpses were abandoned.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 8th] The National Army units that recovered Lingshan are advancing rapidly towards the Pingdu County border, intercepting the fleeing bandit army. [Another dispatch] The bandit army is concentrating all its forces to attack the Xiatuan position. The defending troops bravely counterattacked, inflicting a serious blow on the bandit 94th Division. The National Army's artillery also demonstrated great power, causing heavy casualties to the bandits. They repeatedly reinforced their counterattacks, especially yesterday evening, which was even more fierce. Xiatuan was repeatedly attacked nine times and lost and regained three times.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 8th] Qingdao is now a bandit suppression base in North China. The bandits' large-scale invasion this time seems to be intended to force us to withdraw automatically. The bandit army around Qingdao has a strength of about 18,000 men, with less than 10,000 local bandits, who are poorly equipped.

### British Far East Army and Navy Chiefs Gather in Hong Kong; Hold Emergency Defense Meeting; First Batch of Special Police Force Begins Training Today

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 8th] It is reported that Communist guerrillas and professional bandits have surrounded Kowloon. The British garrison in Hong Kong has been ordered to prepare for action at any time and anywhere. Amidst the tense situation, Lieutenant General Ritchie, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in the Far East, and Admiral Brind, Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy in the Far East, have arrived from Singapore to attend an emergency defense meeting. At the same time, the first batch of special police force will begin part-time training on Monday. In the event of an emergency, the police reserve and special police force can be mobilized at any time.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] British newspapers unanimously emphasized the need to strengthen Hong Kong's defenses on the 8th. Most Sunday newspapers covered the matter with large headlines and published editorials on the front page. "World News" stated, "British Far East forces have flown to Hong Kong." "The Observer" stated, "Hong Kong is awaiting a strong attack." "The Observer" stated, "Hong Kong's two major weaknesses in defense are its water supply and the sabotage of the Communist Fifth Column." "The Sunday Times" stated, "Military circles in London strongly believed last night that guerrillas would begin to infiltrate Hong Kong within days to disrupt transportation and water supplies."

### Hong Kong Police Launch Search; For Murderers of Patrol Officers

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 8th] Hong Kong police have launched a full-scale search for the murderers who killed two British patrol officers and one Chinese patrol officer in Hong Kong waters on Friday. Police believe that the murderers have fled to Danshui in the Communist guerrilla area. Police also believe that after the motive for the incident is fully investigated, it will be important in determining whether the Chinese Communists intend to copy the methods of the Malayan Communists to exert pressure on Hong Kong. Observers believe that similar incidents will follow this one. The Hong Kong authorities have issued a notice offering a reward of HK$20,000 to anyone who provides information leading to the arrest of the real culprits.

### American Newspaper Calls For; Change in Policy Towards China

[United Press, New York, 7th] The New York Herald Tribune said in an editorial on the 7th that the United States' policy towards China has reached a dead end and urgently needs to be changed. Even Chennault's proposal to provide the Nationalist government with $350 million in aid annually is better than the current policy. U.S. policy toward China is weak, wavering, and has reached a dead end. We are witnessing the formation of a great era, and the United States has absolutely no influence on it, nor can it extricate itself. Today, the United States should firmly establish its Far East policy, just as it declared the Monroe Doctrine for the Western Hemisphere and the Truman Doctrine for European Communism.

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 7th] The Howard-owned San Francisco News recently wrote in support of Chennault's proposal to immediately allocate $350 million in aid to China, and called on Congress to decide whether this plan is feasible. The newspaper stated: If communism prevails in Asia, its threat to American security will be even greater than the current dangerous situation in Europe. The United States should be as concerned about its beachhead in China as it is about its outposts in Greece, Turkey, North Africa, and against the Chinese Communists.

### Theft in Our Embassy in the Philippines; Thieves Rifled Through Files

[Central News Agency, Manila, 8th] Unidentified persons broke into our embassy in the Philippines yesterday afternoon (7th), after office hours, and searched the files in the Counselor's Office. Sun Biqi, First Secretary of the embassy, told a Central News Agency reporter this morning that all the files in the Counselor's Office have now been recorded and almost all were rifled through. However, in the preliminary investigation, no important documents have been found to be stolen. Ink pens, watches, and cash in the room were not touched, so the purpose of this act is very clear. Ambassador Chen Zhiping went to Baguio last week to meet with Philippine President Quirino and has now received a report on this matter and will return here on the 10th to deal with it.

### Xinjiang Province Abolishes County Tax Bureaus

### Kunshan and Taicang Situations Remain Unchanged; Communist Army Raiding Shangrao Advances to Qianshan

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] According to a military dispatch released at 9:30 PM on May 8th: (1) The situation in Kunshan and Taicang remains unchanged. Although there were small groups of bandits raiding, they have been repelled by us. (2) This morning there was a small number of local bandit activities in Shaoxing. They have been driven out by our defending troops after being encircled and suppressed. (3) The bandits who raided Shangrao continued to raid Qianshan at dawn today. Our defending troops and local militia authorities are bravely resisting, and fierce battles are currently underway. (4) A unit of bandits raiding Yiyang and Yingtan is now continuing to raid Dongxiang. Our troops are on full alert and determined to inflict a serious blow on the bandits. (5) Bandits in Wuxi and Changshu are forcibly requisitioning cars from various places, urgently transporting food back and forth. (6) From Suzhou, 7,000 to 8,000 bandits, attached with more than ten artillery pieces, raided Changshu on May 3rd, and are now occupying the homes of people in the Zhitang, Zhitang, and Yaozhen areas. Near Shuangfeng, they have also established a logistics station in Zhitang, ordering nearby county and township governments to collect and send military rations. The people are fleeing because they cannot afford the burden.

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 8th] Military News: After a brief contact with the National Army last night, the Communist army advancing westward in Dongxiang has shown no significant activity under the surveillance of the National Army.

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Military News at 10 AM on the 8th: (1) Bandits continued to increase last night (7th) in the Zhitang, Shaxi, and Yuewangshi areas of Changshu, and sent more than 100 plainclothes personnel to Liuhe, Tangjiaxiang, and Loutang to raid and cause trouble. (2) Bandits in Zhitang are currently repairing the bridge and forcibly requisitioning laborers to transport ammunition eastward. (3) The situation in Kunshan and Taicang remains unchanged. There was only a small contact yesterday (7th). (4) We have a strong force stationed in Jiashan, the order in the city is very good, and the phone is unobstructed. (5) More than 3,000 bandits invading Chun'an continued to raid Jiande last night (7th). Another group of about 600 bandits raided Shouchang. The external telecommunications in both places are currently interrupted.

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 8th] The Nanchang market is still quiet. Tin-plated stalls are thriving. Some streets have built wooden fences, and Baojia community patrol teams are patrolling, so the order is very good. The Eighth Pacification Command stationed here has a strong force stationed in the suburbs to protect the safety of the city.

### Air Force Destroys Communist Army Command Post

[Our Report] The Air Force launched extensive attacks on the periphery of Taicang, Liuhe, Kunshan, and Jiashan on the 8th, and also attacked the Communist army's rear supply stations in the Hangzhou and Zhenjiang areas.

Near Zhitang in Taicang, a Communist army command post was destroyed. Aerial observation on the 8th showed that the Communist army's actions were not as densely packed as before, but had become scattered marching, seemingly because they had suffered great damage from the air attacks in recent days and had made rapid changes.

### Recent Situation of President Chiang

— Zhou Hongtao

This article is a reply from Mr. Zhou Hongtao, Secretary of the Tax Bureau and attendant to President Chiang, in response to an inquiry from his friends in Fenghua regarding the President's recent situation. Our newspaper has obtained the original letter and is urgently publishing it for our readers.

Mr. ×× and Mr. ××:

After communicating with Mr. ×× in Tongzhou on the evening of April 24th, at dawn the next morning, we bid farewell to our hometown and proceeded to Xidian. From Xiangshan Port, we boarded a warship and left the province with the season. While packing our luggage and after setting off, I felt an infinite sense of attachment to the beloved people and scenery of our hometown. Our departure will surely cause panic and disappointment among the elders, brothers, sisters, and brethren in the locality. Over the past three months, Mr. Chiang's concern for local security, economy, culture, and education, coupled with the local people's respect and affection for Mr. Chiang, has fostered a deeper bond between us. His mood must be very heavy and saddened. He is exceptionally worried and uneasy about issues such as local security, the Tianyi Pavilion's collection of books, and the revision of the Fenghua County Annals. However, Mr. Chiang is the leader of the nation. Although he is currently out of office, the country and the government still need him to call upon the people and support the nation's united struggle to complete the revolution. He cannot remain isolated in a corner, depriving the nation of his encouragement and guidance. Driven by patriotism, a sense of justice, and the urging of various party, government, and military circles, he can no longer enjoy a leisurely life in the countryside. In his "Message to the Compatriots" on April 27th, he said: "Zhongzheng takes full responsibility for the past political and economic shortcomings and the failure of the military campaigns against the bandits, which have resulted in our compatriots suffering the ravages and killings by the Communist bandits… This is due to my personal lack of virtue and ability. Because I have a particularly deep understanding of the Communist Party's conspiracies and atrocities, I feel especially guilty and pained by the nation's plight and the people's suffering. However, I will never waver in my belief in saving the nation and the people, and I am confident that we will be able to rescue our compatriots from the Communist iron curtain and return them to freedom and prosperity… Compatriots! The nation's peril and individual disasters are imminent… Eleven years ago, Nanjing was abandoned, and the government moved west… Today, Nanjing is abandoned, and the government moves south, which will become our only turning point in the anti-Communist struggle… Final success belongs to those who persevere to the end." This fully explains his desire and purpose for leaving his hometown this time. I believe that after reading this, everyone will understand Mr. Chiang's mood and state of mind at this time, and also understand the reason for his swift departure and his failure to bid farewell to everyone.

Since the abandonment of Nanjing, the enemy has launched a fierce offensive along the Jinghu Railway and the Jinghang National Highway, splitting up the attack on Shanghai and Hangzhou. News of defeats at the front lines has been continuous. Shanghai residents have been startled several times a day, with rumors flying everywhere. Business transactions in stores are scarce, and people are panicking. The Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route is especially congested, with many dependents of fellow villagers returning to their hometowns. All forms of external transportation are in the same state. Prices are falling rapidly relative to the surging silver dollar. Refugees from all over the country are congregating in the urban areas. Amidst such tense circumstances, we followed Mr. Chiang to Shanghai, precisely at noon on April 26th. The warship anchored in the river near the suburbs. Immediately, local military and political figures boarded the ship to greet Mr. Chiang. The small living room on the ship became a temporary reception room, filled with guests. They were all exceptionally excited and, filled with enthusiasm, reported to Mr. Chiang on the general military and political situation, as if they were seeing a long-separated father or elder brother. Witnessing this tense yet intimate meeting, we on the side were nearly moved to tears. The next day, even more guests came to visit. Therefore, Mr. Chiang decided to move to Shanghai in order to converse with his friends and subordinates. We also took our simple luggage ashore and worked in a small house near the river. The local evening newspapers also carried the news of Mr. Chiang's arrival in Shanghai. Several old colleagues also came to see us. After warmly shaking hands with each other, they all said, "It's rare for you to come to Shanghai. We feel very comforted in our hearts. Today, business in the shops is much better than yesterday and the day before." Under such circumstances, day after day, we have unknowingly stayed for five days. The war situation has stabilized west of Kunshan, and Shanghai is gradually recovering its original prosperity. Under the persuasion of various parties, and because Mr. Chiang himself is reluctant to leave the people of Shanghai, we really do not know how much longer we will stay.

Judging from the fortifications around Shanghai, they have been constructed over a considerable period of time, and the military strength is also quite formidable. The internal food reserves are sufficient for three months. At the same time, according to friends in the municipal government, there is a great hope of obtaining material assistance from the United States. However, based on common sense, the only concern lies in the above-mentioned issues. Because Shanghai's population is too large, and the vast majority are engaged in commerce, if the enemy approaches, fuel and food will be scarce, factories will close, and commerce will cease, then the citizens will have nothing to live on. Therefore, in defending a city, the internal economic problems are as important as the military problems. To overcome this difficulty, cooperation between the government and the people is essential. I hope that Shanghai will overcome the current difficulties and fulfill its mission as an anti-Communist base.

Recently, the provincial government retreated through Ningbo, and Ningbo must be very tense. Looking afar at the Yong River, I cannot help but feel nostalgic. Judging from the current enemy situation, the Yong area is not suitable for military operations, and I believe that local security can be ensured. You, gentlemen, are the voice of the local people, and you should make every effort to promote cooperation between the military and the people, which is essential for the party and the country, and for the local area. All of this should be clearly understood and does not require further explanation from me.

I was born here, grew up here, and received my education here. My feelings for my hometown are therefore especially deep. My heart is filled with emotions that I cannot suppress. Therefore, I am taking advantage of my spare time late at night to write this letter to you, gentlemen, to express my feelings of parting, to extend my greetings to all the elders, brothers, sisters, and brethren, and to express my wish that the people of our hometown will continue to love Mr. Chiang. I wonder if you, gentlemen, agree?

Traveling and working are busy. This letter is written hastily and without proper formality. Please forgive me. I will write again later. I respectfully wish you good health.

Midnight, May 1st, from Shanghai

### Editorial: A Turning Point to Break the German Stalemate

As the "Cold War" between the East and the West intensifies with the signing of the Atlantic Charter, a message of world peace suddenly emerges internationally: the Berlin blockade, which has been disputed for ten months, and the blockade between East and West Germany will be lifted, and all traffic will return to normal. This is not only a blessing for the German people, who can avoid the painful division of their homeland, but also the most gratifying event internationally. After the German stalemate is broken, other international problems can be easily solved. Looking ahead to the four-nation foreign ministers' meeting to be held in Paris on the 30th of this month, it will surely transform the international tension into harmony, and make further contributions to the creation of world peace.

However, we must not hold excessive expectations for the foreign ministers' meeting to be held at the end of the month; as long as this four-nation foreign ministers' meeting can thoroughly, reasonably, and fairly resolve the German problem, it will be of immense benefit to the future of peace in Europe. Therefore, we urgently hope that the German problem can be thoroughly resolved first. The establishment of the "prototype government" in West Germany, although it can serve as a precursor to the reunification of Germany, the thorough resolution of the German problem still awaits the joint efforts of the four foreign ministers. According to a United Press Washington dispatch on the 6th, the Soviet Union may propose the following three conditions for the German problem: (1) Unify the entire Germany under a central German government; (2) The four powers accelerate the withdrawal of their occupying forces stationed in Germany; (3) Expedite the completion of a peace treaty with Germany. These three conditions, after the Soviet Union lifts the blockade of Berlin, can still be accepted by Britain and the United States as a basis for discussion at the four-nation foreign ministers' meeting, so that this Berlin problem, which has been deadlocked for ten months, will have a turning point. Regardless of one's stance, this turning point should be welcomed. As reported by Reuters' diplomatic correspondent: European capitals, upon hearing the news that the Berlin blockade will be lifted, all expressed their joy: their happy mood exceeded even the joy of hearing the good news of the end of World War II in 1945.

In fact, the Berlin blockade problem should have been resolved long ago. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, the blockade of Berlin was originally a retaliatory measure, and it has now lost its original purpose; continuing it will only increase the suffering of the German people, so why not lift it as soon as possible? This is even more the case for Britain and the United States. The blockade of Berlin increases the cost of the Anglo-American airlift, which is equivalent to increasing the burden on the people of Britain and the United States. As long as the Soviet Union is willing to lift the blockade first, other issues can be discussed at length. On January 30th of this year, Stalin proposed a plan for world peace to American reporter Smith, the main points of which were four: (1) The Soviet Union is willing to issue a joint statement with the United States, guaranteeing that neither country intends to resort to war; (2) The Soviet Union is prepared to cooperate with the United States in taking measures formulated to fulfill this peaceful partnership, such as gradual disarmament; (3) If the three countries of Britain, the United States, and France agree to delay the establishment of a West German government before the foreign ministers' meeting is held to review the entire German problem, then the Soviet Union is prepared to lift the Berlin blockade, but the three countries of Britain, the United States, and France should also lift restrictions on transportation and trade at the same time. (4) Stalin agreed to meet with Truman to review US-Soviet relations. It is obvious that the Soviets intend to lift the Berlin blockade. As long as the United States also has this intention, it could have been lifted long ago.

However, the United States has always doubted the sincerity of the Soviet Union. Truman has repeatedly refused to meet with Stalin, and the State Department has demanded that the Soviet Union demonstrate its sincerity with facts; therefore, the attitude of the United States is also very clear. In short, the United States has three demands for the resolution of the German problem: (1) The United States is unwilling to abandon other countries and conduct direct negotiations with the Soviet Union; (2) International disputes should be resolved through normal diplomatic channels; (3) If the Soviet Union wants to resolve the Berlin problem, it must first lift the Berlin blockade. In this way, the two sides have once again encountered the "issue of precedence", and the situation has remained deadlocked; the hope for a peaceful resolution of the Berlin problem has once again been shattered. It was not until news came from Lake Success last month that Malik, the Soviet representative to the United Nations, suggested to the American representative: "If the Western countries can set a date acceptable to the Soviet Union for holding a four-nation foreign ministers' meeting, then the Soviet Union will lift the Berlin blockade before the foreign ministers' meeting." This is exactly the ideal that the Western countries have been seeking. Therefore, after a brief contact between the two sides, an agreement was immediately reached, giving the Berlin problem a turning point.

The turning point in the German problem is also a turning point in world peace, which is worth cherishing by all countries in the world. In particular, the politicians and diplomats of Western countries should seize this fleeting opportunity. Not only should they take this opportunity to break the stalemate in the German problem, but they should also use this as a turning point in the creation of world peace. Even with regard to the three conditions proposed by the Soviet Union, whether it is unifying Germany, withdrawing occupying forces, or negotiating a peace treaty with Germany, none of them are things that Western countries are not seeking. The politicians and diplomats of Western countries bear the heavy responsibility of world peace and security, and they should broaden their vision, use their wisdom, seize the opportunity, dispel the dark clouds and gloom in the international arena, shed the sunshine of peace, and allow hundreds of millions of people around the world to feel the warmth of peace.

### Western Three Nations to Hold Preparatory Meeting to Review Common Policy Towards Germany; Palace in Western Suburbs of Paris Selected as Meeting Place for Four Foreign Ministers; US Opposes Withdrawal of Occupying Forces from Germany

[United Press Washington, 8th] The United States, Britain, and France quietly revealed today that before the opening of the Paris four-nation foreign ministers' meeting, the three countries will hold a preliminary meeting to review their common policies toward the West and Germany, but not to jointly deal with the Soviet Union. Secretary of State Acheson announced that he will dispatch Jessup, the monitor for Europe, and Bohlen, an advisor to the State Department, to Paris at the end of next week to meet with representatives of the United States and France. Acheson himself will depart for Paris a week later to formally meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and French Foreign Minister Schuman.

[Reuters Paris, 7th] A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said that when the four powers' foreign ministers meet in Paris on May 23rd to discuss the German problem, they will use the luxurious Rose Marble Palace in western Paris as the meeting place.

[United Press Washington, 7th] A senior US diplomatic official revealed on the 7th that the United States will frankly reject any Soviet proposals for the rapid withdrawal of occupying forces from Germany. He said that the State Department is drafting a counter-proposal so that it can be immediately put forward when the Soviet Union raises this demand at the four powers' foreign ministers' meeting. He said that the United States is still pursuing a long-term occupation policy. Since this person is a confidential advisor to Secretary of State Acheson, and has recently participated in drafting the US military strategy to be adopted at the four powers' meeting, and will certainly be a member of the US delegation, this view can be regarded as authoritative. Although signs behind the Iron Curtain indicate that the Soviet Union's military strategy will be to win the support of German nationalists, the Soviet Union will obviously undermine the Western plan to establish a West German state, and this military strategy relies on the proposal for the rapid withdrawal of all Allied occupying forces. This official said that the United States is firmly convinced that all such Soviet plans will fail. First, this move is opposed by the Western countries, especially France, because they are worried about the resurgence of German aggression; second, many Germans do not want the US military to withdraw. Finally, he warned, "We cannot hope to completely resolve the German problem at the Paris meeting."

### East German Leaders Propose to West Germany to Discuss Steps to Unify Germany; Preparations for Lifting Blockade Almost Completed

[Reuters Berlin, 7th] As Soviet and Western transportation personnel were negotiating the timetable for lifting the blockade last night, the "German People's Council," which claims to represent the entire Germany, suddenly suggested that representatives from West Germany meet in Brunswick in the British zone to draft a plan for the political, economic, and cultural unification of Germany, so as to submit it to the four powers' foreign ministers' meeting in Paris on May 23rd.

The proposal also called for the swift conclusion of a peace treaty and the withdrawal of occupying forces. The proposal was signed by Noske, Kastner, and Grotewohl, representatives of the East German Christian Democratic Party, the Free Democratic Party, and the Socialist Unity Party, respectively. It pointed out that any attempt to create a fait accompli by establishing a West German government before the foreign ministers' meeting would deepen the division between East and West Germany. According to the Western powers, they have repeatedly stated that the agreement reached by the four powers in New York should not interfere with the plan to establish a West German republic, which is scheduled for this summer, but the manner in which the West German constitution is formulated can be applied to the entire Germany after an agreement is reached by the four powers.

[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 7th] Authoritative sources said that the Western countries and the Soviet authorities have made the first contact in Berlin to discuss the details of lifting the blockade, but the content of the discussion is kept extremely secret. At the same time, the British and American representatives of the military transportation agency in the Frankfurt dual occupation zone have also arrived here to discuss the details of lifting the blockade.

[Reuters Berlin, 7th] A British spokesman claimed that British and American transportation officials have informed the German railway authorities that they are preparing to resume train service to Berlin at midnight on May 11th. They also instructed the railway authorities to collect as many train cars as possible in order to transport coal, food, raw materials, and consumer goods to Berlin.

[Reuters Berlin, 7th] The Soviet zone government in Berlin announced tonight that it is willing to immediately restore the supply of electricity to West Berlin after the Berlin blockade is lifted.

### Clay to Leave Berlin for US on the 15th

[Reuters Berlin, 7th] Clay, the outgoing US military governor of Germany, is scheduled to leave Berlin by plane on May 15th, the third day after the Berlin blockade is lifted. He told reporters today that he was very happy to see the Berlin blockade lifted before he left office. He believes that there is a great possibility that the Paris four powers' foreign ministers' meeting will reach an agreement. Clay also said that he did not expect to have the opportunity to say goodbye to the senior officials of the Soviet military government before his departure. If he were to meet them, he would only say goodbye and did not intend to hold any talks. He also revealed that he had never met Marshal Chuikov, who replaced General Sokolovsky as the commander-in-chief of the Soviet forces after the latter was transferred. When talking about his personal plans for the future, he said that he would go fishing after retiring on June 1st and had no other plans. He is scheduled to leave Berlin by plane on May 15th, the day he retires, and will stay in Washington for two weeks to wait for the day of his retirement. Then he will take his wife to spend the summer by a mountain stream. He has no house in the United States, so his address is uncertain. He also stated that he has no intention of writing any memoirs at this time.

### Candidates for President and Vice President of West German Provisional Government

[United Press Bonn, 7th] Well-informed political circles here said that Adenauer of the Christian Democratic Party will be the president of the West German provisional government, and Schmid will be the vice president. Manscher of the Socialist Party will be the interior minister, Kaiser will be the labor minister, and Aschoff of the Free Democratic Party will be the finance minister. The Bonn Constitutional Assembly elected an 18-member "executive committee" of non-Communist parties on the evening of the 6th to temporarily carry out West German political affairs until a government elected by universal suffrage is established. It is generally expected that the executive committee will submit a proposal for the conclusion of a German peace treaty, so that it can be discussed at the peace conference to be convened in Paris.

### Soviet Union Actively Mines Uranium in the Czechoslovak-German Border Area

The mine is located on the Czech-German border, and the richness of the ore vein is the best in Europe.

### Greek Government Urges Communists to Surrender Unconditionally

US to Provide Additional $200 Million in Aid to Greece and Turkey

[Agence France-Presse Athens, 7th] The Athens News Agency today published the Greek government's first comment on the guerrilla's attempt to ask the United Nations to intervene in the Greek civil war. The news agency said, "The work of pacification in Greece is a clear and simple problem, that is, the unconditional surrender of the bandit party and the cessation of destructive Communist rebellion. This view has been reiterated today by the Greek government when commenting on the Slavic Communist attempts to send so-called representatives of the democratic government to New York to discuss the Greek pacification problem. The same sources have also said that if the bandit party wants to end the war, it can only contact the Athens government directly. The Slavic representatives' attempt at the United Nations to make the United Nations intervene in Greek internal affairs was already rejected at the last UN General Assembly in Paris."

[Reuters Washington, 7th] Senior government officials said that the government will ask Congress to approve at least $200 million in appropriations for the next fiscal year to strengthen the combat capabilities of Greece and Turkey. The request will be made at the same time as the government formally submits its $1.45 billion plan for military assistance to foreign countries.

### Pearl Buck Opposes War

Indicates That the American People Are Entering a Dangerous Path, Mainly Opposing Accepting the Orders of Warmongers

[United Press Hartford, Connecticut, 8th] Famous female writer Pearl Buck said today that the Asian people are the most ideal object for world peace. Only the people of China, Thailand, Indonesia, Burma, and India have a philosophical awareness of the world's great unity. The Western world is still in its infancy and cannot make the idea of great unity. American military leaders are leading us on a path of hypocrisy and danger. We must oppose accepting the orders of warmongers. If the government is determined to promote militarism, we should openly oppose it. When mothers openly advocate that their sons join the army, there must be shortcomings in our country's family system.

### Member States Should Have Absolute Freedom to Restore Diplomatic Relations with Spain; UN Political Committee Passes Brazilian Proposal

[United Press Lake Success, 8th] The UN Political Committee passed the proposal submitted by Brazil, supported by Bolivia, Colombia, and the Secretary-General, on the 7th by a vote of 25 to 16, granting UN member states the absolute freedom to restore diplomatic relations with Spain. Sixteen countries abstained during the vote. Both the United States and Britain were among those who abstained (the Soviet bloc and India opposed). However, when the proposal is submitted to the UN General Assembly next week, it does not appear to be able to obtain the necessary two-thirds majority. At the same time, the committee immediately rejected Poland's proposal to strengthen the United Nations' 1946 resolution on breaking off diplomatic relations with Spain, as well as declaring a ban on the shipment of arms into Spain.

He has confidence in the future situation, but said, "There are still many difficulties to overcome." Republic delegation leader Mr. Roem stated: The issue of Dutch troop withdrawal from Yogyakarta will be one of the main issues when both parties discuss how to implement the agreement in the future. Mr. Roem stated that he was unaware of the news from Singapore stating that the leader of the Republic's provisional government exiled in Sumatra, Mr. Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, said that he would refuse to accept the ceasefire order until the Dutch troops had completely withdrawn from the Republic's territory. And he said he "believed" that Mr. Sjafruddin Prawiranegara also agreed to the agreement reached today.

### Burma Strengthens Border Guards to Prevent Collaboration Between Chinese and Burmese Communist Forces, Small Groups of Chinese Communists Have Infiltrated Burmese Territory and Then Returned

[United Press, Rangoon, 7th] A Burmese government spokesperson announced today that Burma has doubled its border guards with China to prevent the collaboration of Chinese and Burmese communist forces. Small groups of Chinese communists have detoured through French Vietnam and infiltrated Burmese territory near Gangdong. After being suppressed by the Burmese army, it is claimed that although communism has recently emerged here, it is not believed that the Burmese Communist Party's actions are in accordance with Chinese Communist instructions, and no important figures from the Burmese Communist Party have left the country recently. The Chinese Communist Party may have contacted its minor groups, but these groups have no power in Burma and are not recognized by the important leaders of the Burmese Communist Party. Burma, governed by Prime Minister Thakin Nu, is not in danger of communization. The Burmese Communist Party is currently divided into two major parties, the Red Flag Party (Trotskyist) led by Thakin Soe and the White Flag Party (Stalinist) led by Than Tun. The Red Flag Party was banned in January 1947, and the White Flag Party was banned in March 1948, becoming underground groups, each fighting against the government. Recently, it was reported that the two parties planned to unite in Prome, a transportation hub, but it was unsuccessful.

[Reuters, Rangoon, 8th] The Burmese government gazette stated that the Burmese government army has recovered two villages occupied by the Communist Party in the Sandoway District on both sides of Burma. Near Bassein in the Irrawaddy River, the government army and the Karen rebels fought fiercely for two hours.

### Rumor of Stalin's Secret Telegram to Washington, Willing to Meet with Truman, The United States Says British and French Leaders Should Also Participate

[Reuters, London, 7th] The Labour Party's "People's Daily" reported that Marshal Stalin had sent a secret telegram to Truman suggesting that they hold a face-to-face meeting to resolve world problems. The newspaper published this news in a very prominent position, and said that although President Truman did not say yes or no, he had informed Moscow that if the next Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference could have good results, and could simultaneously invite British Prime Minister Attlee and French Prime Minister Queuille to participate, then he could also agree to talk to Stalin. The newspaper said that Truman was very cautious and did not want to give the impression that he was bypassing Britain and France to contact the Soviet Union alone, but that Berlin and Washington were only directly negotiating between the United States and the Soviet Union, dividing the world into two blocs, respectively ruled by Washington and Moscow.

### A Discussion of the American Democratic Party (Part 2)

— Translated by Song Guihuang

(V)

Wilson completely revived the Jacksonian Democratic Party of the past. This former President of Princeton University has always maintained a stern attitude, and he has indeed proved to be a political leader with the courage to speak boldly, act with fearless spirit, and educate this generation of Democrats, making them believe that the government should overcome all difficulties to protect civilians.

After the end of World War I, Wilson's domestic reform plan stopped, and the post-war reactionary situation created the Republican atmosphere era under Harding and Coolidge. The collapse in 1929 proved that the prosperity in the 1930s was not sustainable. When the depression descended on the American people from 1930 to 1931, the long lines of people waiting for bread lengthened, and the homeless people built shacks in urban landfills, the two-party system encountered its most terrible test since the Civil War. In 1932, the situation showed that the nation would produce a great president from the Democratic Party. However, if the Democratic Party wanted to solve economic problems, and its ability was no better than the Republican Party, then the people who had survived a narrow escape would seek solutions outside the two-party system.

However, the Democratic Party did produce a leader who could solve the economic crisis. Franklin Roosevelt was able to combine Jefferson's political acumen, Jackson's fighting spirit, and Wilson's ability to inspire people to move forward. The so-called "New Deal" was not without its illogical and contradictory aspects. Since Jackson, no president has been as hated by the people as Franklin Roosevelt, and the remnants of this hatred still exist today. However, the "New Deal" did cure the nervous breakdown that paralyzed the American people in the 1940s. For many years, Roosevelt's shortcomings disappeared in the panorama of his success, because at that time, the American people's fighting hearts and democratic way of life had been restored.

As the leader of the party, Roosevelt strengthened the policies established by Jefferson and Jackson and restored by Bryan and Wilson, as the main policy of the Democratic Party. The liberals of the north, the giants of industry and commerce in the city, and the labor movement, which were originally supported by the farmers of the north, at this time returned to the south as their base, forming the vanguard of the "New Deal" forces. However, the "New Deal's" headlong rush also had a damaging effect on the Democratic Party. During the Civil War, people in the south (including industry and commerce) all obeyed the Democratic Party, but during Roosevelt's administration, the conservatives in the south increasingly expressed displeasure. Only his personal genius could keep them from defecting, but this success was also increasingly diminished. President Truman had no success in this regard.

In short, traditionally, the Democratic Party has been a combination of different elements from the north and south, with internal strife occurring from time to time. Only when a strong leader emerges can it become an effective tool. This political party is also characterized by having strong leaders. Whether the tradition from Lincoln to Roosevelt can win again in the Republican Party can only be seen in the future.

Generally, people believe that the two parties in the United States do not represent any ideology or policy, but looking at the history of the two parties, it is known that this is not the case. The two parties have very different attitudes towards bourgeois rule and the way the president leads. However, in reality, the two parties do not represent completely different and mutually incompatible interests, and this is obviously the source of the strength of the American two-party system. Some people hope that the members of the two parties can still be strictly divided into free and conservative directions, thinking that this is the only way to be logical. Looking back to the time of the 1860 election, the two parties once strictly represented different interests, but after the Republican Party's election failure, the members saw that the party had no hope of seizing power, and as a result, there was no other way but to leave the party. The American two-party system has always maintained a delicate relationship, because the policies of the two parties can be changed, and the members can also advance and retreat, but they will never be greatly hostile to each other, creating an insoluble situation. Compromise is needed within and between the two parties at all times. This is an advantage in the American party system, because in the final analysis, the so-called democratic government is a political system that uses compromise and consent.

Needless to say, political parties are essential for political freedom. A single voting system, as manifested in the totalitarian politics of Nazism and communism, is just a pleasant name for dictatorship. In the past, the American flexible two-party system has always met the needs of American democratic politics, and it is not unreasonable for us to hope that this system can continue to meet the needs of the American people.

### The Origins and Development of the Karen Rebellion in Burma

— Xu Siren

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Yangon] It was on the afternoon of November 19th last year that Mr. U Tun Pa, Minister of Propaganda of the Burmese Government, held a press conference at the Burmese Press Association. At the meeting, the host, U Tun Pa, said to the reporters present with a nervous face: "...Everyone, the purpose of today's reception is to report to you the occurrence of an extremely regrettable thing. The manufacturer of this thing should not only not, but also be too unintelligent, so the Burmese government has disregarded everything to announce this thing." After Mr. U finished this short speech, he continued to send each reporter a printed picture speech. The written speech wrote: "...What I want to tell everyone here is that Mr. Campbell, the Myanmar correspondent of the London Daily Mail, was arrested by the Myanmar government the day before yesterday based on the National Defense Ordinance. The reason why the Myanmar government arrested Mr. Campbell was because Mr. Kang had incited the rebellion of ethnic minorities in Myanmar, and caused the conflict between the ethnic groups in Myanmar. The Myanmar government has obtained solid evidence of Mr. Kang's behavior. The reason is that in August of this year, Mr. Kang once entrusted Mr. Simon, a pilot of British Overseas Airways Corporation, to bring a letter sealed with fire paint to Colonel Darrel, a British soldier in Calcutta, India. The content of that letter contained the following sentences: "...The letter entrusted by Mr. has been sent to Mr. SS yesterday because the recipient is not here. Mr. M is waiting for Mr. to send arms and ammunition at No. 1. Regarding the news of the two ships opened by Mr. Boris's friend, Mr. Q has been notified. According to Mr. SS, the situation is not good. If no foreign aid is received, it may be difficult to support it for another fifteen days. I have been to his headquarters and learned that ethnic minorities are capable of providing full assistance. The friends on the mountain are not only not developing southward, but are making trouble for themselves. Now it is impossible to hope that they will assist. It may not be possible to enter Yangon. K and others are now only consolidating the towns they occupy. They may use the occupied areas as a base to negotiate with the government. They feel the lack of weapons, and the government confiscated many of their previous weapons before their rebellion, thus weakening their power..." The reason why the secret of this letter was leaked was because Mr. Simon, who Mr. Campbell entrusted him to bring the letter, was a member of the British Progressive Socialist Party and firmly opposed British interference in Myanmar's internal affairs. Colonel Darrel, the recipient, was considered to be in charge of the rebellion of the Lun people in Myanmar. Therefore, Mr. Simon secretly opened Mr. Campbell's letter to read. When he discovered Mr. Campbell's secret, he immediately copied down the content of Mr. Kang's original letter and reported it to Mr. U Pa Ken, the Burmese ambassador to Pakistan. After receiving the report, Mr. U Pa Ken quickly notified the Burmese government to take action to detain Mr. Campbell. When Mr. Campbell was arrested, another document addressed to Colonel Darrel was found on him, which stated: "...I recently met with Mr. Oliver at the Karen General Assembly, and submitted the letter you sent to him requesting money. He has promised to send the money to you. I haven't seen him for seven or eight days since that day. It wasn't until yesterday morning that he brought the news to be published in the newspaper. They have now occupied areas from Mao Shijiadang to Boda, etc. (Editor's note: Mao Shijiadang is a market area in Burmese-Siamese)

They are also repairing the Japanese-built airport. Also, they have recently occupied the surroundings of Zhitang, Mao Luomian, Basen and other places, and have organized administrative institutions in Mao Luomian. Yesterday, a government plane was detained by them, and they can expect to occupy Dan Lao and Browm within days. Oliver said: They need arms very urgently, and are hoping that you will send them to Mao Luomian by sea or air. Your friends are also looking forward to sending money. To be honest, the current situation is not very satisfactory. Our friends have not taken thorough action. My actions in Yangon are being monitored, and it is very difficult to send news to Calcutta. The Red Karen do not help the Karen in the plains because of conflicts in Guan religion. Smithon, who joined the Burmese government and was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Burmese Army, does not cooperate with us as we expected. He was simply bought by the Burmese government. In short, if Fubert cannot provide all the tools that the city needs, I am afraid our plan will fail..." After Mr. Campbell was arrested, everyone focused their attention on the development of the matter. Everyone had long expected that the development of the matter would be nothing more than the British government issuing a solemn statement saying that Mr. Campbell's actions were personal and had absolutely nothing to do with the British government.

As expected, the statement from the British Embassy in Myanmar came the day after Mr. Kang was arrested. Needless to say, what he said was what everyone had expected, saying that Mr. Kang's incident was entirely a personal action by Mr. Kang and Colonel Darrel. The British ordered that they did not know anything, and the Burmese government could punish Mr. Kang with the punishment he deserved. It also said that Mr. Kang was captured and handed over to the Burmese government by the British Embassy in Myanmar itself. Some people say that this is Britain's "sacrificing the small self to take care of the big self." Otherwise, the matter has already been exposed, and the clear and accurate physical evidence that the British are helping the Karen people to resist the Burmese government has fallen into the hands of the Burmese government. If the British had not sacrificed a "small self" Campbell, and made such a 180-degree turn, how would the British face the world?

Implementing the Rebellion

Regardless of whether the British instigated the Karen to resist the Burmese government, it is true that the Burmese Karen are using force to fight for self-government. As early as a few days after Myanmar's independence last year, the Myanmar government suddenly received a petition from the Karen demanding that Yong Sheng County, Khan Da Fuli County, and Bosheng County in the Delta, and the Dana Shao Ling District in southern Myanmar, etc., be designated as the Karen State. This sudden request really made the Myanmar government unable to figure it out. Because in the process of Myanmar striving for independence, although the Karen did not make every effort, they did not openly oppose it. When Myanmar gained independence and formed a government, the Karen also sent people to participate. It was really unexpected that the Karen would come up with such a sudden change. Afterwards, although the government used a pacification policy to temporarily suppress this problem, the Karen's demand for division has been brewing. In August of last year, the Karen in the Delta, taking advantage of the government's busy response to the rebellion of the Burmese Communist Party and the White Armband Volunteer Army, took advantage of the fire to rob, and used force to drive away the government administrative officials in several Karen areas in the Delta, and organized administrative institutions by the Karen people themselves, implementing regional autonomy, and at the same time using force to defend these places, not allowing the government army to invade. At that time, the government was too busy to cope with the Burmese Communist Party and the White Volunteer Army, so it had to yield and comply. Later, although the government established a investigation committee and set out to investigate the public opinion in the areas that the Karen requested to be divided, and announced the government's policy towards the Karen, saying that as long as the Karen's demands were reasonable, within the possible scope, the government would allow the Karen's demands as much as possible. However, this promise, which was similar to a blank check, failed to satisfy the Karen, and therefore the Karen unrest continued to spread; however, at first it was just a local disturbance, and they did not dare to openly raise the Karen flag. It was not until after the Campbell incident occurred that they slowly changed from semi-covered to public. First, on January 10 of this year, the Karen near Mao Luomian in southern Myanmar began to formally demand the establishment of a state and division of governance by force. The Burmese government naturally refused to do so. Therefore, the ethnic war between the Karen and Burmese ethnic groups also broke out. Mao Luomian was occupied when the incident occurred. Following this, the important town of Barlin in the Delta also fell. More than a thousand Karen troops in Baulum (an important town in western Myanmar) also rebelled. The Karen in Mandalay, the Burmese capital, also joined forces with the Burmese Communists to occupy the Burmese summer resort of Miao, which is 43 miles away from the Burmese capital, and Dong Gua, Min Sala, Renwei Shen... and other places below the Burmese capital. Even the Karen people in Dama (five miles from Yangon), Yin Sheng (thirteen miles from Yangon), and Liju (twenty-five miles from Yangon) in the suburbs of Yangon rebelled. The port of Duandi in the Delta had long been occupied by the Karen station, causing all maritime transportation in the Delta to be unable to navigate. The Karen agitators in the suburbs of Yangon originally wanted to occupy Yangon, but fortunately the government discovered it early and was able to intercept it at Dama. The fighting in the suburbs of Yangon has been going on for almost a month since the reporter wrote this manuscript, but the government army has still not been able to recapture Yin Sheng. The unrest in the Mandalay area is also intensifying, and Prime Minister Thakin Nu insists that this war is a war between good people and bad people, not a war between the Karen and Burmese ethnic groups, and is absolutely unwilling to resolve it peacefully.

[Central News Agency] Peng Youchu, a second lieutenant and administrator of the Special Company of the × Tank Regiment of the Armored Corps, was poisoned by the enemy and served as a communist spy. He recently plotted with Wang Runde, a first lieutenant platoon leader of the Seventh Company of the regiment, to incite mutiny. However, the platoon leader had a strong sense of righteousness and was not moved, and voluntarily reported the plot. The regiment uncovered the plot. Tang Bu, commander of the Jinghu-Hang Garrison Headquarters, was deeply appreciative upon receiving the report and rewarded Platoon Leader Wang Derun with 5,000 silver dollars, in accordance with the reward and punishment measures of the Songhu Area Defense War. Peng Youchu was executed on the spot for inciting mutiny.

### Street Vendors Spring Up Everywhere; Everything for Sale Available; Actual Business Hours 15 Hours

[Our Newspaper] In recent days, the number of people setting up "street stalls" to sell goods along the roads of this city has increased unprecedentedly. This type of "street stall" market was originally limited to a few locations in the city, such as Qiujiang Road, Wuding Road, Laoximen, and the Central Market on Nanjing Road, but currently, they are springing up everywhere like mushrooms after rain. In particular, the section of Xizang Road from Nicheng Bridge in the north to Nanyang Bridge in the south, and the section of Jinji East Road from Baxian Bridge to Dongxin Bridge are connected to each other, with almost no space left on the sidewalks, making it difficult for pedestrians to move. Its grand scale is even more lively than the "glass cabinet stalls" that swept the city after the victory. The goods displayed for sale on these street stalls are of various kinds and have everything, including various daily necessities, woolen and silk fabrics, leather shoes, medicines, books, cosmetics, mechanical parts, clothing, etc., almost like an open-air department store.

There are four types of stall vendors

According to a brief survey by reporters, among the people engaged in setting up these street stalls, those who sell family treasures because they cannot make a living due to the dissolution of the service organization account for 10%; current employees of various factories and firms who set up stalls to sell some of the in-kind goods they receive when they are paid account for 30%; those who originally regarded this type of street stall as a fixed occupation, or who have only moved to the central district from other places, account for 20%; and those who were originally mobile "scalpers" buying and selling silver dollars but switched to street stalls due to restrictions of the official orders account for 40%.

Sweatshirts and socks sell the best

Because the sources of goods for sale by these four types of people are different, the price difference is very large. On average, summer supplies are the most expensive, and items such as sweatshirts and socks sell the best. Most of the customers are housewives and military and government personnel. As for the location of their stalls, it is impossible to fix every day. Because there are many people and the place is narrow, they must rush out to occupy a site after the end of martial law in the early morning, and those who arrive later cannot find a place. The time for setting up stalls is mostly from 6:00 AM to 9:00 PM, with actual business hours of 15 hours, which is the longest business hours of all businesses in Shanghai today.

### Disturbance at the Golden Theater; Gunshot Fired, Fortunately No One Injured

[Our Newspaper] At the Golden Theater at the intersection of Jinling Road and Xizang South Road, at around 10:00 AM yesterday, a special morning show was screened because it was a Sunday. Unexpectedly, at around 10:35 AM, more than a dozen people wearing golden uniforms demanded to enter without tickets. After the theater staff's advice was ineffective, six people in golden uniforms rushed into the cashier's room, and without asking why, they used leather belts on their bodies to violently beat staff members Chen Fukui, Pei Xiaoping, and Zhao Yanghua. Later, the manager of the theater, Tang Rong, stood up and fired a gun, but he was slapped twice. Before leaving, he fired a shot, fortunately without injuring anyone. After the Songshan Police Branch Bureau received the report, a large number of police officers rushed to the scene, but the troublemakers had all fled.

### HMS London Arrives in Hong Kong; Journalists Invited for Tour

Official Reports Details of Attack

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 7th] The British warship HMS London arrived in Hong Kong at 9:30 AM on the 7th and invited reporters on board for a tour at 10:00 AM. Responsible personnel from various departments of the warship reported to the reporters on the incident of being shelled by the Communist army on the Yangtze River, stating that the warship had more than four artillery battles with the Communist army, firing 477 shells. At that time, in addition to returning fire to the Communist army, the warship had to rescue injured personnel from other ships sailing downstream.

### Recent Situation in Lujiabang on the Edge of the Flames of War; Refugees Flee in Droves; Schools Continue to Teach

Since the Jinghu train terminates near Lujiabang, this remote town has become a vital transit point on the edge of the flames of war. The town is a little way from the Shanghai-Suzhou Road (the bridges at Anting, etc., are damaged and cannot be used. We hope that the people there will quickly find a convenient way for pedestrians). From the Lujiabang station six miles away, tens of thousands of refugees walk or cross the border by train every day, supporting the old and carrying the young, some are wearing suits and leather shoes, and some are in cheongsams with permed hair. It takes about two days to reach Suzhou via Qiandunjiao from Lujiabang. The local civil defense association and philanthropists are providing tea and porridge, and increasing the number of ferries. Temples and public places are used as refugee shelters, with almost no space left, accepting refugees day and night based on human mutual aid and sympathy. However, there are also a few dim sum shops that cut corners, reduce materials, and raise prices. It is said that profit makes people lose their minds.

The population of Shanghai is being evacuated westward, but there are also several cases of people traveling long distances from Nanjing, Changzhou, and Wuxi, taking a train at the town to go to Shanghai, every day, and the number is not small. Many of them do not have ID cards, leading to hesitation and helplessness on the wrong road.

Every time a train arrives, there are hundreds of workers going to the town to buy food, or exchanging it for real objects such as cigarettes, causing the price of rice to jump several times a day. Whole slaughtered sheep and pork are transported out in large quantities. The local township office and civil defense association have set restrictions due to the increasing number of shoppers.

Hongjun Middle School and Lujia National Elementary School continue to have classes as usual. However, the public grain for elementary school teachers has long been nowhere to be found.

Twelve miles away in the direction of Qiandunjiao, there was inhumane behavior of people impersonating soldiers robbing refugees, causing some refugees to sadly turn back, wanting to cry but having no tears. After the security team leader Xu heard about it, he was furious and sent a team to investigate and capture them. Therefore, it has been safe recently, and the act of bullying refugees has slightly diminished.

### Two Notorious Robbers Executed for Continuous Gang Robbery; Three Accomplices Sentenced to Imprisonment

[Our Newspaper] The Songhu Garrison Headquarters executed two notorious robbers, Wu Sanxiao and Zhu Guiyuan, at Jiangwan yesterday morning. The two criminals had repeatedly committed gang robberies in this city. They were arrested by the police bureau and sent to the military court of the garrison headquarters for trial. They were found guilty and sentenced to death according to martial law. Three accomplices in the same case, Sun Nanbin, Tian Changcai, and Zhou Zhenwu, were sentenced to imprisonment. Sun Nanbin was sentenced to 15 years, Zhou Zhenwu to two years, and Tian Changcai to one year.

### Gold Industry to Concurrently Engage in Silver Dollar Trading; Doubtful that it Will Start as Scheduled Today

[Our Newspaper] It is learned that in order to bring the price of silver dollars back on track, the competent authorities, including the Central Bank and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, separately convened responsible persons from the Gold Industry Association of this city last week for talks, ordering the association to prepare to concurrently engage in silver dollar trading, and scheduled to start trading in the gold market today at the same time as gold. Yesterday afternoon, reporters inquired about the details from the association. It was reported that the association authorities did have informal contact with the competent authorities regarding the opening of silver dollar trading. However, whether or not it can be listed for trading on Monday at the same time as gold still depends on whether the official documents from the competent authorities are issued. As of Sunday afternoon, the official documents had not been issued, so it is doubtful that it will be listed for trading as scheduled today. It was also reported that the silver dollar traders in the gold market are still limited to the 107 members currently affiliated with the Gold Industry Association. Whether other stores with silver dollar exchange permits issued by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau can simultaneously enter the market for trading is currently not being considered.

### National Banks to Improve Silver Dollar Issuance Method

[Huadong News Agency] In recent days, the Central Bank has been issuing silver dollars as much as possible to commercial banks and firms for withdrawals. Each day, silver dollars, fixed-amount banknotes, and silver dollars are issued in three types according to the overnight deposit balance of each bank and firm. Since the issuance began on the 5th, more than 600,000 silver dollars have been issued in the past three days. However, commercial banks and firms have only been issuing banknotes or fixed-amount banknotes to customers for withdrawals in recent days, and rarely issuing silver dollars, so most of the silver dollars issued by the National Bank are still piled up in the warehouses of the banks and firms and have not circulated in the market. The lack of bargaining chips in the market affects the market price. It is heard that the financial authorities are paying close attention to this and have decided to improve the method of issuing silver dollars in order to increase market supply, suppress market prices, and avoid being used by people to hoard and profiteer.

### Passenger Sales Completely Stalled; Unprecedented Difficulties for Industries; Department Store Retail Sales Barely Sufficient to Pay Electricity Bills

[Huadong News Agency] After the flames of war approached Shanghai, the transportation of this city to the outside world has become increasingly blocked, and industry and commerce have been greatly affected. Not only have passenger sales in North China and the Yangtze River completely stalled, but also nine out of ten of the routes along the two roads have also stalled. Although shipping to South China is still smooth, it is difficult to transport goods to the south due to the lack of berths. Under the current situation of being surrounded on all sides, industry and commerce are facing unprecedented difficulties, and trade in various industries is almost zero. Industries such as customs declaration and transportation are almost on the verge of collapse. At the same time, retail sales in various industries in this city have also seen sales failing because purchasing power is so low. The total retail income of some large companies is not enough to pay the electricity bill. The situation is almost identical to that during the "August 13th" Shanghai War.

### Jeep and Truck Collide; Police Officer Severely Injured

[Our Newspaper] At around 7:00 AM yesterday, a jeep police car of the Huangpu Police Branch Bureau, driven by driver Sun Keqiang (25 years old, from Northern Jiangsu), was passing Linsen Road and Shaanxi Road when a giant truck, driven by Han Jingxuan (35 years old, from Ningbo), a driver of the Motor Vehicle Brigade of the Ordnance Command of the Jinghu-Hang Garrison Headquarters, suddenly came from the south to the north. Because it was too late to avoid it, it collided with the jeep. Sun Shaoran, a police officer from the Huangpu Branch Bureau, was knocked down after being hit and fell unconscious. Afterwards, the guards at the scene rushed to bring the two drivers back to the Branch Bureau for verification. The injured person was rushed to nearby Yihua Hospital for treatment. It is learned that he was severely shaken, and was still in a coma until dusk.

### Drunkenness Leads to Wife Murder; Three Knife Wounds, One Fatality; Worker Xu Zhengqiu Flees After the Incident

[Our Newspaper] Worker Xu Zhengqiu, from Hubei, lived at No. 28 Xuanchang Lane, Guihua Road, Shanghai West, i.e. Tokyo Road, and married Dong Tianxiu (36 years old, from Anhui). The couple often quarreled. Yesterday was a Sunday holiday. At around 2:30 PM, Xu was drinking alone and became slightly drunk. Suddenly, he was touched by something on his mind and brought up old matters to Dong. Dong retorted, and a conflict broke out, followed by mutual beatings. Then Xu grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed Dong fiercely three times in the chest, abdomen, and ears, half an inch deep, with blood splattering on his clothes. Dong collapsed, barely breathing. Xu knew that he had committed a serious crime and fled without a trace. After someone reported the incident to the Putuo Road Police Branch Bureau, Section Chief Zhu ordered the police to rush to the scene to investigate. However, the perpetrator was nowhere to be found. The police urgently hired a car to transport Dong to the Labor Hospital on Xikang Road, but she died on the way because her injuries were too severe. The police bureau has dispatched personnel to track down the fugitive perpetrator.

### Military Accident on Nanjing West Road; Two Pedestrians Suffer Broken Legs and Facial Injuries

[Our Newspaper] Zhang Cheng (23 years old, from Henan), a driver of the 17th Motor Transport Regiment, was driving a giant truck of the regiment at around 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, traveling east to west on Nanjing West Road when he reached the intersection of Xikang Road. In order to avoid other vehicles, he carelessly overturned Zhao Linggen (45 years old, local) and Wang Changmao (39 years old, from Zhejiang), who were riding bicycles. Zhao's legs were broken, and Wang's face was injured. The wall of the Hardoon Garden also collapsed. Afterwards, the nearby sentry police arrived and took the driver Zhang Cheng, who caused the accident, to the Jing'an Temple Branch Bureau. After interrogation, he was transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation.

After holding on for 20 minutes, Samsung got four corner kicks, all of which were safely defused by Huang Shijie one by one. The first half ended with no gains for either side. After changing sides, the situation was still tense, only creating highlights for Huang Shijie and Liao Xiong. Until the end, there was no harvest, and the two sides shook hands and made peace.

### China Aviation Wins Narrowly Against Qunli; 4-3, a One-Goal Difference

The A Division football league is nearing its end. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, China Aviation and Qunli met in Yiyuan. There were few spectators, only about one or two hundred. Both sides were unenthusiastic. China Aviation's strength has dissipated, and Qunli's host Pan Shijie has also gone to Hong Kong. In a fierce battle, China Aviation defeated Qunli by a one-goal difference of 4-3.

The whistle blew to start the match, and China Aviation's five forwards advanced. Gao Xiuqing forced a shot and scored first. Not long after, Qunli counterattacked, and Lin Shaojun took a corner kick, which was well-placed. Chen Longquan scored a low shot, tying the score. After fighting fiercely for 27 minutes, Shang Huajun intercepted the ball and passed it forward. Gao Xiuqing single-handedly raided the camp, and Xian Boming charged into the formation. Gao flipped the ball towards the empty goal, and Zhao Yongfang hooked it out with a big kick, defusing the danger. In an instant, Chen Longquan sang and acted by himself, scoring a goal, taking the lead 2-1. The first half ended soon after.

After a short break, the two armies engaged in battle. China Aviation remained in its original formation, while Qunli Yu Musen entered the lineup, replacing Lu Fangkui. China Aviation fought hard, Xu Zuguochuan passed the ball, Xian Boming pounced out, and Li Shunsheng pushed the ball into the goal near the door, tying the score again. After that, Zheng Simin hung a pass in front of the goal, and Xu Zuguochuan soared into the sky. China Aviation continued to work hard, and Li Shunsheng passed the ball to the middle, Gao Xiuqing single-handedly entered the door, taking the lead again 3-2. China Aviation's morale was boosted, and they were even more successful. Zheng Simin marched quickly, hooked the ball along the bottom line, and Xu Zuguochuan made a cut shot, making the score 4-2, giving them an overwhelming advantage. Qunli's anger soared, vowing to recover their lost ground. Lin Shaojun cut down a goal in the chaos. After that, although the two armies worked hard, they failed to achieve anything. Time ran out, and China Aviation won by a one-goal difference of 4-3.

### Exciting Games at the Gymnasium: Two Friendly Matches End in Draws

Yesterday, there were two exciting friendly basketball games at the gymnasium. Coinciding with the holiday, there were many fans. These games were also the first exciting matches after the gymnasium was lent to the hospital. The Green Forest team fought the Shanghai Police team to a draw. The Green Forest team played wonderfully, but unfortunately, their initial shots were not accurate enough to secure a victory. However, their ability to draw with the Shanghai Police team shows their fighting spirit. Ren Yu and Er Yu focused on team cooperation, but their shooting and free-throw percentages were lower than usual, which was a slight disappointment. Jiu Er made the most of his individual strengths and high-speed attacks, which were very effective. Both teams ended the game with a score of 43.

### Today's Grade A Table Tennis League: Postal Service B and Postal Affairs to Battle Huamei

The previous match saw Quanlv defeat Postal Service B by three matches to two.

The fourth Table Tennis League has already entered its fifth week of competition today. Today (9th), starting from 5:30 PM, there will be two Grade A matches and four Grade B matches. In Grade A, Huamei will face both Postal Service B and the Postal Affairs team. Huamei has won all three of its matches and has a strong lineup. It still appears to be a strong contender for the championship this year. Except for the defending champion Jingwu team, the other teams are not their opponents. In this match against two strong teams, Huamei should be able to easily defeat Postal Service B in the first game. However, in the second game against Postal Affairs, they must field their best players. Most of the players on the Green Huamei team were players from the Shanghai Star team, the champion of the second league. Back then, they were careless and only six players attended, resulting in them losing three consecutive matches after winning the first three, and ultimately losing to Postal Affairs by a score of three to four. If they are still careless this time, they may be taught another lesson. Although Postal Affairs has lost twice, it was partly due to incomplete personnel and partly due to bad luck. This time, facing a strong team, they will definitely give it their all. It is not impossible for the old story to be repeated. The schedule for today is as follows:

Huamei vs. Postal Service B (Grade A) 5:30 PM Postal Affairs

Huamei vs. Postal Affairs (Grade A) 7:00 PM Postal Affairs

Dagong vs. Lulian (Grade B1) 7:00 PM Jinmen

Zhaoshang vs. Postal Service 18 (Grade B2) 7:00 PM Yousi

Lianqing vs. Xinyi (Grade B2) 7:00 PM Xinyi

Xinxing vs. Chouhong (Grade B3) 7:00 PM Chouye

The day before yesterday, Quanlv played against Postal Service B at the Postal Affairs' gymnasium. The competition between the two sides was fierce. Unfortunately, in the second match, Zhu Qingji of Postal Service B committed two touch-the-table faults due to extreme tension, resulting in a two-point penalty. His psychology suddenly changed, and he was out of sorts, allowing Lu Yongkang of the opposing team to take the opportunity to attack fiercely, turning defeat into victory and winning by two matches to one, creating an absolute advantage. Postal Service B had a strong comeback, winning the fourth and fifth matches, but ultimately lost to Quanlv by a score of two to three.

(Quanlv) Score (Postal Service B)

Dai Xing 21-15 21-18 Dai Yongquan

Lu Yongkang 21-13 12-21 22-20 Zhu Qingji

Ma Gengyao 21-16 21-19 Zhu Zhongsun

Fan Liangji 22-21 14-21 16-21 Yu Chunrong

Wang Yishan 22-20 15-21 13-21 Zhu Jinhai

Grade B Results

Tianxiang defeated Tiema (Grade B2) 4-1

Zhaoshang defeated Zhongnong (Grade B2) 4-1

Postal Service 18 defeated Xinghuo (Grade B2) 3-2

Lingyun defeated Yousi (Grade B1) 4-1

Yucai defeated Postal Service 3 (Grade B3) 4-1

Haiguang defeated Zhongji (Grade B1) 5-0

Haiguang defeated Zhongji

In the match between Haiguang and Zhongji, the latter's skills were also quite good, but after Haiguang unfortunately lost to Shanbao by two matches to three, they practiced diligently under the encouragement of Wang Zongzao and Li Peide, making rapid progress. In a one-sided situation, they won all five matches by two games to zero, which is commendable. Currently, there are no undefeated teams in Grade B1, and four teams have only lost once. Haiguang is one of the four teams, and their future is promising.

(Haiguang) Score (Zhongji)

Sun Zhaohong 21-14 21-13 Hong Chaoqun

Yang Yongkang 21-18 21-19 Xu Yonghai

Lu Jixing 21-8 21-11 Shen Baosheng

### Short-Distance Prodigy Paden Sets Two World Records in a Row

[United Press Los Angeles, 7th] South California University short-distance prodigy, Paden, set two world records in a row at this track and field meet today. Paden's 220-yard dash time was 20.21 seconds, and his 100-yard dash time was 9.1 seconds. The International Amateur Athletic Federation just recognized Paden's 9.3-second 100-yard world record yesterday. However, today's new 100-yard record may not be included in the world record due to the favorable wind. The new 220-yard record will be included in the official record.

### Establishing Civilian Medical Relief Institutions: Shanghai Branch of the Red Cross Seeks Housing

To the Editor: In view of the needs of the times, our association plans to establish civilian medical relief institutions to provide universal services to all sectors of society. We have made considerable preparations for all medical supplies, personnel, and other items; however, we still lack suitable housing for use, which makes it impossible to start work. Considering that many residents in this city have voluntarily evacuated and left Shanghai recently, there are quite a few vacant houses; if you can kindly rent them to us, whether for a long or short term, we would welcome it, so that relief work can be carried out in a timely manner. There is no shortage of enthusiastic public-spirited people in Shanghai. At this time, we hope to cooperate with them. We have always appreciated your newspaper's support, and we hope that you will publish this letter to broaden the scope of our request. We would be extremely grateful! Sincerely,

Social Services Department, Shen Bao Shanghai Branch of the Red Cross

Address: 856 Xinwen Road, Shanghai Telephone: 34366
