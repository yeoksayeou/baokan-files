### Acting President Li Flies Back to the Capital; Important Consultations with Key Figures Expected; Sun Ke and Cheng Qian Will Come Separately

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Acting President Li, from the 20th to the 25th, spent six days successively flying to Guangzhou, Guilin, Changsha, and Hankou for inspection tours. He has completed his first southern tour since taking office and returned to Nanjing on a special "Ziqiang" plane from Hankou at 5:10 PM on the 25th. The special plane landed at the airport of the Ming Palace Flight Transport Brigade. Government and military officials in Nanjing, including Tong Guanxian, Wu Tiecheng, He Yingqin, Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Zhongxin, Xu Yongchang, Bai Chongxi, Gu Zhutong, Hong Lanyou, He Yaozu, Huang Shaozi, Li Dachao, Liu Weizhang, Chen Kewen, Huang Bodu, Ye Gongchao, Ni Jiongcheng, Zhang Shouxian, Zhang Yaoming,  Jie, Huang Zhenwu, Xu Jingzhi, Liu Shiyi, and Zhu Huafeng, totaling several dozen, all came to the airport to welcome him. The special plane landed at 5:10 PM. Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Zhizhong, and others greeted him at the aircraft door. After Acting President Li alighted from the plane, he first shook hands with Wu Tiecheng, saying, "You've come!" Then, he shook hands with each of the welcomers to express his regards. At that time, He Yingqin was squeezed to the side by the welcoming crowd, and a certain follower immediately informed Acting President Li, "Respectful Duke [He Yingqin] is here!" Acting President Li then stepped forward to shake hands with He, calling out, "Respectful Duke! Respectful Duke!" Bai Chongxi and Wu Zhongxin both came to welcome him despite their illnesses. When Acting President Li shook hands with Bai, Bai hurriedly placed his cane aside. The airport was filled with enthusiastic scenes. Acting President Li was wearing a Western suit and a black overcoat. Although he was tired from several days of travel, he was still in high spirits. He then took a car back to his official residence at Chuanhougang to rest. Gan Jiehou, Qiu Changwei, Huang Yuncun, Cheng Siyuan, Li Yuqing, and others who accompanied Acting President Li on his tour, also returned to Nanjing on the same plane. Legislative member Zhang Yongcheng also came along from Guilin.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The important consultations among central and local officials, which are about to be held in the capital, may begin within two or three days due to Acting President Li's return to Nanjing on the 25th. Official sources no longer deny these consultations, but say that this is not a gathering, but rather a discussion. The content of the discussion will be the current general situation and the issue of peace talks with the Chinese Communists. Although the source was unwilling to reveal whether internal unity is more important than the decision-making of the current situation in this consultation, the fact proves that in this discussion, the opinions of the central government and local governments will be completely unified to make further efforts for the dawn of peace. Acting President Li's southern tour of the four provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, and Hunan, exchanging opinions with local leaders and local figures, has achieved good results in unifying opinions. This trip can also be regarded as a prelude to the important consultations in the capital. After Acting President Li and President Sun Ke had several long talks in Guangzhou, their wills were completely unified. It is reported that the key officials participating in this consultation will include He Yingqin and Wu Tiecheng in Nanjing. Xu Yongchang, Gui Yongqing, Zhou Zhirou, and Gu Zhutong, Bai Chongxi, who came to Nanjing from Hankou, Zhang Zhizhong, who came to Nanjing from the Northwest, and the heads of the Executive Yuan, Cheng Qian, who is about to come to Nanjing from Hunan, and Zhang Qun, who is about to come to Nanjing from Chongqing. If Shao Lizi, Yan Huiqing, and others who went to Beiping at that time have returned south, they will also be invited to participate. However, because this consultation is not a gathering, it may start soon after Sun Ke arrives in Nanjing from Guangzhou.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Cheng Qian, Director of the Changsha Pacification Headquarters, will come to Nanjing from Hunan within two or three days. This was the decision made when Acting President Li invited Cheng during his visit to Changsha. Acting President Li invited Cheng to come to Nanjing to participate in a meeting to discuss the current general situation.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] After returning to Nanjing, Wu Tiecheng met with He Yingqin, Zhang Zhizhong, Bai Chongxi, and others on the 25th. Minister of Interior Hong Lanyou also visited He Yingqin, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhizhong, and others on the morning of the 25th.

### Acting President Li and President Sun; Discord Not a Fact; Huang Xuecun's Interview with Reporters

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] After returning to Nanjing, Huang Xuecun, spokesman for Acting President Li and Director of the Second Bureau of the Presidential Office, met with reporters and said: Acting President Li's southern tour successively inspected Guangzhou, Guilin, Changsha, and Hankou, and the results were very satisfactory. The heads of local governments and people from all walks of life unanimously expressed their support for the government's peace policy. Acting President Li exchanged opinions with President Sun several times in Guangzhou. President Sun has expressed that he will come to Nanjing soon. The rumor that Acting President Li and the president have not fully reconciled their opinions has been proven to be untrue. Acting President Li's invitation to important leaders from various places, such as Zhang Zhizhong and Cheng Qian, to come to Nanjing is only to exchange views on the current general situation, and there is no meeting in a specific form. When a reporter asked whether the National Assembly representatives in Guilin had written to Acting President Li requesting that he fully exercise his powers, Huang replied: Changsha and Hankou also expressed the same thing. The reporter asked: Acting President Li announced the cancellation of martial law in the non-war zone, but has not been implemented in various places? Huang replied: Guangzhou, Guilin, Weisha and other places are still under martial law. He did not inquire in detail whether Hankou is still under martial law because he did not stay in Hankou for a long time. A reporter asked: A Guangzhou dispatch in a Shanghai newspaper reported that Acting President Li instructed the National Assembly representatives in Guangzhou, saying: "If the Communist army crosses the river, we will fight to the end." Is this true? Huang said: He has not heard Acting President Li say this. When reporters asked about Shao Lizi's report, the progress of peace talks, and whether the issues of releasing Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng had been resolved, Huang replied, "I have been away from Nanjing for a few days and do not have any information yet."

### At a Reception for Wuhan's Various Circles; Acting President Li's Sincere Speech; Explaining the True Meaning of Peace; Pointing out Three Key Points for Reforming Politics

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 25th] Acting President Li arrived in Hankou from Hunan today for an inspection tour. Gan Jiehou, Yin Changwei, Huang Xuecun, Cheng Siyuan, Wei Yongcheng, and others came with him. Previously, the Acting President's special plane was originally scheduled to arrive at 9:00 AM today. More than 200 heads of agencies and organizations in Wuhan rushed to the airport on time to greet him. After waiting for more than three hours, they suddenly heard the rattling sound of the plane in the southwest sky, and the welcoming personnel were very excited. At 12:10 PM, the "Ziqiang" special plane slowly landed at the airport. Li alighted from the plane amidst the melodious sound of military music. First, three female students from St. Louis Girls' School presented flowers on behalf of the citizens of Wuhan to pay their respects. After inspecting the guard of honor, Li was accompanied by Xu Zuyi and Li Pinxian, the deputy commanders-in-chief of the suppression headquarters, and entered the city by car. Citizens lined the streets to welcome him, vying to see his demeanor. Applause and firecrackers resounded incessantly. The Acting President frequently waved his hat to signal to the citizens, showing warmth and kindness. After about an hour, he arrived at the official residence of the suppression headquarters to rest and have lunch. In addition to the senior generals of the suppression headquarters, Zhang Xielun, Zhu Dingxiang, Xia Wei, Yan Xunfu, and other administrative heads were also present. He inquired in detail about the local situation during the meal. At 2:10 PM, the Acting President held a tea party at the Deming Hotel to entertain all sectors of Wuhan and gave an impromptu speech. Li first said: Today, all mankind in the world expects peace and construction, and the elimination of war. The Chinese people have suffered the most from the disasters of war and are most eager for peace. He firmly believes that this kind of popular aspiration cannot be violated by anyone, and the wish for peace will be successfully achieved. Li believes that the few stubborn elements who have not yet understood the true meaning of peace should be guided and corrected. It is said: "Looking at Chinese and foreign history, any political group that is superstitious about force and alienated from the people will inevitably fall into disintegration. We must accept the bloody lessons, admit the reasons for failure, and work together for peaceful nation-building. I deeply feel the arduous responsibility, but I am determined to go through fire and water. All difficulties and dangers are not what I personally worry about. Whether peaceful construction will succeed in the future depends entirely on whether the people of the whole country sincerely urge it." When discussing political reform, Li suggested three points: (1) In order to relieve the people's suffering, on the one hand, we must take into account people's livelihood and stabilize the economy, and on the other hand, we must respect freedom of speech and action, and eliminate the spiritual shackles of the people, in order to enter the democratic path. (2) To reform politics, we must first rectify discipline, eliminate corruption, change all decadent practices, and thoroughly seek benefits for the people. (3) The current urgent task is to abolish redundant agencies, eliminate the long-standing malpractices of buck-passing and constraints, and adopt the principle of streamlined troops, adjust the military system, so as to save the national treasury and reduce the burden on the people. At this point, Li reiterated that this political reform and the effort for peace are the consistent demands of the whole country, and he earnestly hopes that everyone will unite their strength and move forward together. Everyone responded with warm applause. Finally, Li Jincheng, a senior figure in Hubei Province, gave a speech, saying that the points indicated by the Acting President were not much different from what he saw in the Communist area. If he can continue to work hard for peace, the future is very promising. At 3:20 PM, the Acting President and his party left Hankou and flew to Nanjing amidst the cheers of the crowd. The heads of all agencies went to the airport to see him off. According to reports, Li stayed in Hankou for only three hours, and rarely came into contact with the outside world in a hurry.

### Hunan's Various Circles Welcome the Meeting Chairman's Four Requests

[Our Changsha Dispatch, 25th] The welcome meeting for Acting President Li was held by various circles in Hunan at 9:00 AM on the 25th. After Li gave a speech, Tang Boqiu, speaker of the Hunan Provincial Assembly, made two points to the president: (1) Strictly rectify discipline and reform politics; (2) Take into account the suffering of the people and stabilize people's livelihood. Based on these two points, the following requests were made to the acting president: (1) Please the president overcome all difficulties and thoroughly implement the seven peace measures: (2) In the past, the central government adopted a policy of exploitation of local finances. After the currency reform, the people of Hunan exchanged their blood and sweat for gold yuan coupons. As a result, the central government even transported the gold from the Changsha Central Bank, losing 30 million people's hearts with 30,000 taels of gold, which was very unwise. Please, the president, immediately order the head office of the Central Bank to return it. (3) There are hundreds of malpractices in conscription of soldiers and grain, which the president knows very well. I hope the president will immediately stop conscripting soldiers and grain. (4) In the past, the National Resources Commission's control of Hunan's special minerals was too unreasonable. Please order to lift it immediately. After the meeting, they went to the airport. They took off to Hankou at 11:00 AM. Chairman Cheng was unable to go on the same plane because he had official duties to deal with.

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 25th] Acting President Li visited Hunan and stayed here for a total of 21 hours and 5 minutes, leaving the people of Hunan with the most profound impression of democracy, enlightenment, enthusiasm, determination to seek peace, and determination to reform politics.

In Liu's long letter, his criticism of Sun Ke was quite fierce, and he also made a special historical analysis of the decline of the Kuomintang.

He said: For many years, corruption and corruption have long existed among a few wealthy and rich officials, who were all paupers before the 16th year of the Republic of China.

Hangzhou

[Our Newspaper, 25th] After the announcement of the financial and economic reform plan, the Hangzhou market's reaction was initially a rise followed by a fall. The rise in commodity prices was astonishing, with rice soaring to 13,000 (currency unit). By evening, the gold market had fallen to 142,000 (currency unit), and "Big Head" silver dollars to 1,600 yuan.

Wuxi

[Our Newspaper, 25th] Today's market situation fluctuated greatly. Flour reached a new peak: Early rice 12,420 yuan, late rice 12,300 yuan, wheat 13,500 yuan, white wheat 14,500 yuan, flour 5,470 yuan, soybean oil 65,000 yuan, cotton yarn 4,200,000 yuan.

Suzhou

[Our Newspaper, 25th] As soon as the new economic plan was announced, people became restless, and commodity prices became strong. It was then heard that a large amount of supplies were being sold off in the Shanghai market, and prices gradually declined again. High-quality white rice was traded at 13,700 yuan in the morning, coarse rice at 11,500 yuan, flour at 5,500 yuan, wheat at 15,500 yuan, and "Tianguan" cotton yarn at 460,000 yuan for immediate payment.

Furthermore, the Social Affairs Department of the County Government, considering the soaring commodity prices today, suspected that unscrupulous merchants were creating trouble. They, together with the police bureau, inspected the membership certificates at the flour market in the Pinfang Teahouse in the Xuanmiao Temple. As a result, more than 60 people were found to have no certificates. After being taken back to the county government for interrogation, they were all released. The county government is currently drafting market management regulations to strictly manage market transactions in various industries and prevent speculation and manipulation.

Zhenjiang

[Our Newspaper, 25th] Amid the financial and economic reform, commodity prices in Zhenjiang suddenly jumped wildly. Gold for sale was 14,400 (currency unit), and for purchase was 13,000 yuan. Top-quality cooked rice was 12,000 yuan, medium-quality was 11,000. Jinshan flour was recorded at 5,900, and white paper at 14,000 per ream. Other cotton yarn and foreign goods rose by varying degrees, from 20% to 30%.

Nanchang

[Our Newspaper, 25th] On the eve of the announcement of the new economic and financial reform plan, the market here was already fluctuating, and today it is even more chaotic. More than a hundred silver dollar vendors were imprisoned, but the value of the silver dollar remains high. The "Big Head" silver dollar was quoted at 1,600 in the afternoon, a sharp increase of 400 compared to yesterday. High-quality early rice was traded at 7,200 at the retail outlets, an increase of 2,000. Gold for sale was quoted at 155,000, an increase of 30,000. Regarding this volatile market, this reporter visited responsible officials, who all stated that they were awaiting orders to handle it. According to Yang Ming, the Director of Finance and concurrently Secretary-General, the chaos in today's market is largely due to human factors. He stated that the local finances have not yet been studied in detail, but self-sufficiency is already insufficient and will become even more difficult in the future. According to observations by people in the economic field, this kind of volatility is expected to stabilize after a certain period.

Changsha

[Our Newspaper, 25th] After the announcement of the financial and economic reform plan, the Changsha market experienced a surge in prices because the commodity tax on goods such as cotton yarn and matches was changed to collection in kind, and items such as oil, salt, silk, and cloth were mutually marked up. This reporter recently visited economic experts such as Hou Houpei, inquiring about their opinions on this measure. They all believed that this was not a formal "reform plan" but rather a "transitional" method of "helping the poor." Whether it can achieve practical results depends on whether silver dollars can be cast in large quantities and quickly enter circulation. If only the sound of stairs is heard but no one comes down, the devaluation of the gold yuan notes will be even more concerning than in the past.

Guangzhou

[Our Newspaper, 25th] After the announcement of the new economic plan, the market here was extremely volatile. The Hong Kong dollar rose and fell sharply, reaching a high of 455 and then falling back to between 410 and 420.

Commodity price fluctuations are slight, and gold and silver transactions have become more active after being conducted openly.

Editorial

### Critique of the New Financial and Economic Reform Plan

The financial and economic reform plan, which has attracted nationwide attention, was passed by the Executive Yuan Council on the 23rd and immediately promulgated and implemented yesterday by Acting President Li using the "emergency clause" of the Constitution. This is another reform of our country's currency system, which is of utmost importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and naturally deserves our attention. Especially today, when prices are soaring and people are struggling to make a living, whether this new financial and economic reform plan can stabilize the financial situation, curb prices, and rescue the people from their suffering is of even greater concern to the people of the whole country.

It has only been six or seven months since our country reformed its currency system last August, and the value of the gold yuan note is quickly catching up with the old legal tender! We believe that the reasons for the current economic crisis are no more than the following three: (1) the ongoing domestic war has led to huge financial expenditures and an unbalanced national budget; (2) the continued expansion of the gold yuan note has caused gold, banknotes, and silver dollars with financial attributes to drive up commodity prices; (3) the inability to balance foreign trade, with export trade stagnating and foreign goods pouring in, creating an unprecedented trade deficit. Therefore, the new financial and economic reform plan adopted by the government this time is naturally aimed at these three drawbacks. However, whether it can be effective seems to be too early to be optimistic.

First, regarding the financial aspect, the new plan adopts the following measures: (1) A comprehensive estimate will be made of the materials and funds needed for military affairs this year, and realistic and reliable plans and preparations will be made in advance. (2) A budget will be compiled in accordance with this year's policy guidelines, so that all expenditures will be within a certain scope, and there will be no additional budget increases. (3) The financial revenue and expenditure system will be revised, and land tax will be entirely attributed to local governments, so that the provinces and cities will no longer rely on subsidies from the national treasury. (4) The requisitioning of grain will be stopped. (5) Customs import duties will be calculated and paid in customs gold units. (6) Commodity tax will be collected in kind according to the tax rate. (7) Salt tax will be handled in the same way as commodity tax. (8) For business income tax that is directly paid to the central government, a method of apportioning and contracting payment among industries may be adopted. On the surface, these measures seem to be very practical and easy to implement, and it is not difficult to achieve the ideal of balancing the state's financial revenue and expenditure. However, based on actual conditions, these eight measures can be summarized in one sentence: they are still no more than the four words "increase revenue and reduce expenditure." We do not need to talk about theory, but only consider the current actual situation. Whether the financial measures in the new plan can be fully effective is still a question. To be honest, in today's situation where the war or peace is undecided and the situation is becoming increasingly serious, no one can make an accurate estimate of the military needs and government expenses, and no one can guarantee that the government will not propose additional budgets after compiling the budget. Even if expenditure is to be reduced, it is still impossible without the government having a decisive determination to wield the axe and not be afraid of offending people. Secondly, the government wants to increase revenue, customs duties are paid in customs gold units, taxes are collected in kind, and in order to reduce subsidies to local governments, local tax collection restrictions are specially relaxed. Whether these measures can increase government revenue and achieve the ideal of financial balance is also a question.

Secondly, regarding the monetary system, the important measures stipulated in the new plan are three: (1) People are allowed to buy and sell gold and silver, and the Central Bank may also buy and sell gold and silver. (2) Silver dollars are allowed to circulate, and the government may raise funds to purchase silver and mint silver dollars. (3) Foreign currencies are still prohibited from circulating, and the Central Bank will exchange foreign currencies according to the gold price and foreign exchange certificate price. These three measures can be said to be the "restoration" measures of our government's financial measures. When reforming the currency system, people were not allowed to hold them, and they were not allowed to buy and sell them. They were only allowed to exchange them with the government. Not long after, the original intention was changed, and people were allowed to hold them, and the National Bank handled the gold and silver deposit and exchange method. Not long after, the deposit and exchange method was stopped. Now, the cable is tied up with allowing people to freely buy and sell, and walking back to the old road from which it originally started. This "restoration" policy of returning to the original point is a unique invention of the Chinese government. In terms of actual effectiveness, whether the new plan can achieve the effect of "stabilizing the financial situation" still depends on whether the financial authorities have the determination to continuously sell large amounts of gold and silver. If the government is still greedy for petty profits as in the past, and always wants to compete with the people for profits, and when the gold reserves gradually decrease, it is unwilling to sell them, or even wants to recover them for the state, then not only will the financial situation not be stabilized, but it will also increase the crisis of financial and economic turmoil due to repeated reversals!

Thirdly, regarding import and export trade, there are no novel measures except for the opening up of self-provided foreign exchange. If this is all there is to it, and it cannot do its best to promote export trade, then seeking a balance of import and export trade will still be empty!

However, having said that, this new financial and economic reform plan, although it is still treating the head when the head hurts and treating the feet when the feet hurt, is still a way out of no way. As long as the financial authorities are determined to stabilize the financial situation, are willing to speak honestly and do honestly, and can use the spirit of wielding the axe, on the one hand, selling large amounts of gold and silver to withdraw gold yuan notes, and on the other hand, immediately stopping the printing of gold yuan notes and no longer resorting to the issuance of paper money, then both measures will be taken simultaneously, and the turbulent situation of the financial economy will naturally be calmed down.

### Lapham to Meet Hoffman; Decision to Submit Aid to China Report to the U.S. Congress; Economic Cooperation Administration to Purchase Tin from Us

[United States Information Service, Washington, 24th] John Lapham, head of the China Division of the Economic Cooperation Administration, told reporters on the 24th that he intends to stay here for several weeks. While here, he will consult with Economic Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman and other Economic Cooperation Administration officials and assist the Economic Cooperation Administration in submitting a report to Congress on further economic aid to China.

Hoffman recently told reporters that the Economic Cooperation Administration may not need to request additional aid to China funds before the end of the current fiscal year on June 30. The Economic Cooperation Administration's economic aid to China program was approved by Congress last year to continue until April 1949. However, approximately $80 million of the $275 million appropriation for economic aid to China remains unused.

Hoffman stated that the Economic Cooperation Administration will request Congress to extend the economic aid to China program to the end of June, using the remaining funds for assistance. Most of these remaining funds are left over from the Economic Cooperation Administration's suspension of a $70 million power construction and reconstruction plan for China due to the unstable situation in China. Some materials originally intended to be shipped to North China have also been declared suspended.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 24th] New approval of rehabilitation expenditures announced by the Economic Cooperation Administration today includes the purchase of materials from China and the Philippines. One is to approve the purchase of tin and tin-based alloys worth $300,000 from the British and American occupation zones of Germany to China. The other is to purchase plant fiber products worth $355,000 from the Philippines, also for use in the British and American occupation zones of Germany.

### Three Medical Training Teams to Come to China from the United States to Work

[United Press, New York, 24th] The United Medical Aid to China Association decided at its meeting tonight to stipulate in the 1949 budget to fund three medical training teams to China. If circumstances permit, they will depart for China this year. The team members will be selected from American medical experts, and teachers from Chinese medical schools will be "trainees." According to Association President Ge Legesheng, one of the courses taught will be radiology. The United Relief Organization previously donated hundreds of electric light machines to China, but most of them are now discarded and unused due to the lack of experts to operate them and technicians to repair them, which is a pity.

### American Merchants Are Conducting Trade Between the Communist Areas and Japan

[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] According to United Press sources, negotiations on the commencement of private trade between China and Japan are underway. Mr. Li, the Chinese manager of the American-registered Arblebber Lee Import and Export Company, said that he has been discussing with foreign trade officials of the Allied Headquarters the exchange of soybeans from North China and Northeast China for Japanese goods. US officials have confirmed that they are considering this proposal, but have not indicated whether they will allow Japan to have economic relations with the Communist regime. It is generally believed that this proposal requires a policy decision from Washington. Mr. Li's company is conducting this through its Hong Kong branch, which is still maintaining offices in North China and Northeast China. The company will act as an intermediary in the proposed barter trade. Japan will not directly conduct business with the Communist government and North Chinese merchants.

### Soviet Films Gain Popularity; Becoming Familiar with New Terms; the Ways of Life of Chinese and Foreign People in the Old Capital Are Changing

[United Press, Peiping, 25th] The ways of life of Chinese and foreign people in the old capital are obviously changing along new lines under the new regime. Soviet films are gradually replacing American color films. People who read newspapers or listen to the radio are already familiar with terms such as reactionary, anti-democratic, capitalist, and imperialist. The Communist Party is different from the Kuomintang. It allows dancing. The Six Nations Hotel and the Peking Club have had four dances in the past week. Students strongly support the new regime and express their loyalty at every opportunity. Foreigners without permits from the military authorities dare not easily leave the city. Some have applied to Tianjin to handle business, and some have inquired about whether they can go south or abroad. Reports say that trade between Hong Kong and the Communist areas does not specify which ports are involved. Both sides are using barter trade, using Hong Kong's pigments and paper to exchange for cotton and silk.

### News from the Finnish Capital: Soviet Union Increases Troops on Arctic Border, Intention Possibly to Intimidate Norway

[United Press Helsinki, 25th] Well-informed sources said today that the Soviet Union has been increasing its troop deployments near the northern border with Norway, augmenting its military strength in the area. These troops have been dispatched from the Murmansk Military District, the number of which is unclear. The troop movements began last week and are clearly related to Norway's intention to join the North Atlantic defense treaty. There is no indication yet whether Soviet forces will take similar action on the Finnish border. It is noted that the Soviet Union recently proposed a five-year non-aggression treaty to Norway, which Norway not only rejected but also is preparing to join the North Atlantic Treaty, which the Soviet Union detests.

[United Press Oslo, 25th] Norway's military hub, the "North Cape," is the gateway for the Soviet Union into the Atlantic Ocean, and the Soviet Union could occupy it with a battalion of troops at any time. The area is near the Soviet Arctic border and currently has no protection. At the same time, northern Norway's defenses are weak and vulnerable to attack. Although the Norwegian Communist Party's influence is not large, it is excellent at engaging in internal sabotage. Norway's border with the Soviet Union is 132 miles long, and its border with Finland is 450 miles long. The importance of the North Cape's position is equal to the Soviet Union's Mediterranean throat, the Dardanelles Strait, and the North Sea throat, the Skagerrak. Soviet military officers are familiar with the area's geography. In 1944, Soviet forces pursued German troops, penetrating a hundred miles into Norway. Norwegian officials admit that Norwegian forces in the north are not sufficient to resist the Soviet army. Norway's more solid defense line is at the port of Narvik.

[Associated Press Oslo, 25th] A Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesman recently stated that reports from Helsinki about the Soviet Union strengthening its defense forces on the Soviet-Norwegian border are inaccurate. He said that the Foreign Ministry had not received this information.

Churchill strongly stated that the idea of making Europe a united whole is in line with the needs of the vast majority of people throughout the European continent.

[United Press Brussels, 25th] The International Conference of the European Unity Movement opened today at the Belgian Academy. The initiator, British Conservative Party leader Churchill, and the Belgian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Spaak will both deliver speeches. A chairman will also be elected at the meeting, and French Socialist Party leader Guy Mollet is expected to be elected. The meeting will draft a comprehensive European policy, stipulate the goals of the unity movement, and plan to establish a European Supreme Court to implement the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Approximately 150 representatives from 21 countries are attending, including the UK, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria, Greece, Turkey, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and West Germany. In terms of exiled countries, Spain, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia are also participating. The so-called European Unity Movement was initiated by independent groups in various European countries with the aim of organizing a European Federation along the lines of the American Federation. The leaders of the unity movement are Churchill, Spaak, Italian Prime Minister Gasperi, former French Prime Minister Blum, and Churchill's son-in-law, Sandys. A preparatory meeting was held in The Hague last May, and after the Western European Union Council of Five agreed to establish the European Committee and Consultative Assembly last month, the European Unity Movement became even more enthusiastic.

### Evatt to Visit India: Will Meet Nehru

Indian Communist Party Urges Railway Workers to Launch General Strike

[This newspaper report] New York, 25th broadcast: Canberra news: Australian Foreign Minister Evatt departed for New Delhi today and will meet with Nehru to discuss the situation in Burma and other issues. The Indian government has also invited representatives from Pakistan and Ceylon to attend the meeting.

[Agence France-Presse Bombay, 24th] The Indian Communist Party issued a statement tonight saying that the government's widespread arrest of communists is nothing more than a fascist attack on the rights of labor and trade unions. Prime Minister Nehru's and Deputy Prime Minister Patel's anti-communist movement is aimed at negotiating loans with the United States and assuming the leadership of the Asian group under the wings of imperialism. The statement urged millions of railway workers to stage a general strike on March 9th to protest. It continued that India is preparing to openly and shamelessly occupy a position in the so-called Pacific Pact, a copy of the North Atlantic Treaty, and to join the Anglo-American military alliance to wage an imperialist war against the Soviet Union and democratic China.

### Soviet Union Accuses Asian Conference of Being an Anti-Communist Bloc

Indian Ambassador to Soviet Union Calls it Absurd

[Associated Press Moscow, 24th] The Indian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mrs. Pandit, told the Associated Press on the 24th that "the Soviet Union continues to misinterpret the purpose of the Southeast Asian conference, constantly accusing India of forming some kind of secret alliance with imperialist countries." The Soviet press has pointed out two points: (1) Indian President Nehru convened this conference "to form a resistance group against communist activities in Asia"; (2) India is a "loyal pawn of Britain and the United States." Mrs. Pandit denied this, saying that the Asian conference was convened for the specific purpose of liberating Indonesia from the Netherlands. "It is absurd to say that India is a tool of anyone. India has always advocated protecting the freedom of Asia and preventing all colonial rule."

He said in a fighting tone that after reviewing the Republican Party's opposition to the communist legislative program, "I plan to travel the country again by train to tell the people how their government is progressing."

Delivers Speech Criticizing Communism

[United Press Seoul, 25th] South Korean President Syngman Rhee delivered a speech today criticizing communism.

### Soviet Union Expels Anna Louise Strong: A Warning to the Chinese Communist Party

Views of American Journalist Walter

[United States Information Service Washington, 23rd] Paul Walter of the Baltimore Sun's Washington office wrote in the Sun today that it is believed here that the Soviet Union's arrest and expulsion of Ms. Strong is a warning from the Soviet Union to the Chinese Communist Party, telling the CCP to stay within bounds. Walter said: People who specialize in analyzing Stalin's strategies have put forward a theory here today that the Soviet government's expulsion of an American woman on the grounds of "espionage" may be of far-reaching importance. They believe that the arrest and expulsion of Strong is not just an attempt to conduct anti-American propaganda, but an action aimed at tightening Stalin's control over Manchuria and the areas further south in China occupied by the communist-led troops. According to their assumption, the Soviet Union's intention in this action is to give the leaders of the CCP army, Mao Zedong, a strong hint not to overstep the boundaries like Tito of Yugoslavia. They pointed out that Ms. Strong, in her writing, enthusiastically supported Mao Zedong. Before last July, she had been a guest of Mao Zedong, where she spent twelve months. She was arrested a week ago when she tried to obtain permission from the Soviet Foreign Ministry to meet with Mao Zedong again.

The Seoul government's application has been supported by Argentina, Canada, China, Cuba, France, Norway, and the United Kingdom and the United States. The Soviet Union attacked the Seoul government as a "colonial puppet," and Ukraine supported it.

### US Presents Outline of Plan to Assist Backward Countries to UN Economic and Social Council: Requests Development of Plan for Discussion

[United Press Lake Success, 25th] US Representative Messersmith presented today to the United Nations Economic and Social Council the outline of President Truman's plan to develop economically backward countries, requesting United Nations cooperation. The plan did not mention the amount of investment that the United States might make. It only proposed that the United Nations and its specialized agencies formulate concrete plans for the Economic and Social Council to discuss at its summer meeting. Messersmith said that it would take decades to improve the economies of various countries. The lives of tens of millions of people can only be gradually improved, but if the United Nations agencies can cooperate in a cunning manner, they may greatly accelerate economic development. This plan promotes the investment of private capital in necessary areas under appropriate protection. Unlike the old-fashioned imperialism that seeks to exploit foreign interests, this plan is different.

### Fierce Battle at Insein Rail Yard, 10 Miles North of Rangoon

According to pro-government reports, the Karen ethnic group continues to flee to avoid being severely attacked by government forces. Officials announced that government forces killed 50 communists 70 miles west of Rangoon in Bassein, but the communist riots and the Karen rebellion are clearly unrelated.

[Another dispatch] Rangoon has become a front line today. Armed guards patrol the streets day and night or are stationed outside government offices. Military vehicles heading north are endless. For a week, refugees from Insein and the suburbs have been taking vehicles or walking along the road, with dirty faces and disheveled hair, carrying only one bundle of luggage, pouring into Rangoon.

### Implementing Plans to Curb Speculation: National Bank to Massively Sell Commodities Today. Silver Dollar Reserves Sufficient to Control the Market; Xu Kan Scheduled to Fly to Shanghai Today to Announce Implementation Details of the Plan.

[Our Reporter] Finance Minister Xu Kan and National Bank President Liu Gongyun are scheduled to arrive in the city this afternoon from Germany. They will immediately convene a meeting with financial and industrial leaders in the city to distribute the implementation details of the new economic plan. The National Bank's sale of gold and tightening of credit yesterday can be interpreted as preparations before the implementation of the new plan. Yesterday afternoon, daily interbank lending rates had already risen to 45 and 50 yuan. Today, there are sugar and yarn loans exceeding ten billion, and bank branches have differing levels of reserves, further tightening credit. It is generally speculated that the National Bank will massively sell precious metals and commodities today, fully cracking down on speculation and normalizing the market, so as to promote the reform plan.

Regarding the prospects for the implementation of the new economic plan, it is generally believed that the basic elements for success are balancing fiscal revenue and expenditure and ceasing inflationary issuances. Another essential factor is the National Bank's silver dollar reserves, which must be sufficient to control the market and maintain currency credibility in the long term. Regarding the National Bank's silver dollar reserves, there are three estimates: 50 million, 70 million, and 100 million coins. Although the exact number cannot be confirmed, its strong financial strength is beyond doubt. In the future, the National Bank will inevitably stipulate and maintain a ratio between silver dollars and gold yuan, and whether the ratio is flexible or fixed will depend on the National Bank's policy and whether industry and commerce can bear their expenses under long-term price stability. Furthermore, general observers agree that prices are unlikely to fluctuate greatly in the short term.

[Another Report] Since the announcement of the financial reform plan, specific decisions on financial technology issues related to the Shanghai market in the future must await the return of National Bank President Liu Gongyun to Shanghai. It is reported that Mr. Liu will return to Shanghai from Guangzhou today.

### New Plan Announced: Gold Market Active; Speculation Runs Rampant, Everyone Rushing In; Each Firm Trading 1,000 to 2,000 Bars; Gold Shops Meet to Discuss Resumption of Business.

[Our Reporter] In the new financial reform plan, the free trading of gold and silver has been opened. The long-dormant gold and silver market in the city has become active again since yesterday. Gold trading in the money exchange shops on Sichuan Road and the securities firms in the Securities Building was lively again yesterday morning. Speculators who generally operate in the stock market or commodity market have shifted their targets to the gold market, creating a rush, and transactions in each gold shop have tripled. According to reliable estimates, the average transaction volume of gold in major gold shops yesterday was about 1,000 to 2,000 bars per shop. In the future, gold market transactions will generally be settled on the same day between 9:30 AM and 12:30 PM. From 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM, settlements will be extended to the next morning.

Buying and Selling Prices Widely Divergent

According to observations from those in the gold industry, after the resumption of open trading of gold and silver yesterday, general market prices relied solely on quotes from a few large gold shops. When transactions were busy, the buying and selling prices of small gold shops could diverge by about 100,000 yuan per ten taels, while the closing prices diverged by only 20,000 yuan. The excessive discrepancy in market prices makes it necessary to restore centralized market trading. Therefore, several gold shops with a long history maintain a reserved attitude and remain closed, awaiting the authorities to fully disclose the new plan before deciding on a new direction for resuming business.

Most Hong Kong Ingots Refused

Furthermore, the gold ingots traded in each gold shop yesterday required a minimum purity of 99%. Those with insufficient purity, except for the factory bars of the Central Bank, were discounted according to the purity marked on the bar. All other "refrigerated goods" were refused. Even six-tael ingots from Hong Kong were mostly refused. This is because there are too many fake Hong Kong ingots, and it is impossible to check the purity of each one during busy transactions.

Yesterday, the gold jewelry shops in the city held an informal meeting to discuss ways to resume business under the new plan, but no conclusion was reached. It was decided to convene a board meeting today to make a final decision. It is said that the shops may resume listing and trading jewelry as late as next Monday.

### The Sound of Clinking Everywhere; Silver Dollars and Other Currencies See an Uptick; Price Differences Have Narrowed.

[Our Reporter] After the announcement of the financial reform plan, the city's silver dollar market changed its "underground" posture and began to operate openly. The "open-air markets" for silver dollars, which have secretly gathered in Lao Bei Men, Henan Road, Fuzhou Road, Tongfu Road, Xiafei Road, and Race Course Road in recent months, have become even more active since yesterday. In contrast to the police precinct's relaxed Economic Police Team, thousands of silver dollar vendors are trading without scruples, and the situation is unusually enthusiastic. The sound of clinking can be heard almost everywhere in the surrounding bustling areas. Because the general public heard that the prices of goods in stores would soon be denominated in silver dollars, they rushed to the market to buy them. Yesterday, the price of silver dollars could have been raised, but due to widespread rumors that a large number of new and old silver dollars stored in the mint would be released in the coming days, and silver dollar vendors had accumulated loose funds, the result was only that each silver dollar fluctuated between 1,500 and 1,600 gold yuan. "Small heads" such as Dragon Dollars, Eagle Dollars, Ship Dollars, and Sichuan Dollars, which have always been inferior to "Big Heads" (Yuan Shikai dollars) for months, are also being purchased and collected instead of "Yuan Heads" because it is generally believed that their purity and weight are not much different from "Yuan Heads" and that they may be used at the same price under the principle of open circulation in the future. As a result, their prices have gradually risen, and the price differences between various currencies have gradually narrowed. Based on the situation observed throughout the day yesterday, silver dollars may become a common object of value calculation and storage for the general public in the near future, and various businesses engaged in silver dollar trading will spring up like mushrooms after the rain.

### Expert Comments on the Plan: Analyzes Three Advantages, Sufficient to Alleviate the Crisis.

[Central News Agency] Since the announcement of the financial reform plan, initial reactions have been mixed. General prices fluctuated more in the morning, indicating that various parties did not thoroughly understand the new plan and therefore adopted a wait-and-see attitude. However, prices fell across the board in the afternoon. According to an economic expert's view on the new plan, its advantages are: (1) The circulation of silver dollars can reduce the issuance of gold yuan to curb inflation; (2) Imports and exports can be developed, especially imports can use self-provided foreign exchange to promote trade; (3) Tax payments calculated in customs yuan can increase tax revenue and eliminate the drawbacks of past tax revenue depreciation. Furthermore, according to the analysis of the new plan's content by general personnel, although the plan is not extremely perfect and cannot completely solve the current economic problems, it is a good remedy for alleviating the crisis at present. The most obvious aspect is the development of trade, which can have the effect of invigorating the financial market and bringing floating capital into the right track, so that the market can prosper. If the government can further control materials and adjust them as appropriate, the price hike can be gradually eased and move towards a stable path.

### Shou Jingwei Expresses Hope.

Avoid Old Ways of Treating Serious Illness with Weak Medicine

After the government announced the financial reform plan, the reporter specifically visited Shou Jingwei, Chairman of the Shanghai Import and Export Business Association, to inquire about his views. According to his statement, the government authorities have a deep understanding of the economic crisis of shrinking production and lack of materials. However, the two fundamental solutions of material adjustment and increased production have not yet been announced. It is expected that concrete plans with the right medicine can be formulated within days to meet the expectations of the import and export industry. At the beginning of his tenure, Finance Minister Xu had proposed a chain system to develop trade, and there were precedents for production and export material loan methods. It is hoped that the government will earnestly use its financial power, and whether it is (1) low-interest production loans or (2) purchase contracts for export material loans, it will be able to avoid the old ways of treating serious illnesses with weak medicine and adapt to the urgent needs of industry and commerce with sufficient funds. Then, in this process where the dawn of peace has appeared, the southeastern and southwestern provinces can still expect to increase production to seek sufficient foreign exchange and stabilize people's livelihoods.

### New Customs Yuan Notes to Be Issued Soon

The government will adopt a customs yuan system for import duties, similar to the past customs gold unit system, with each customs gold yuan pegged to US 40 cents. The Central Bank will be responsible for issuing the customs yuan notes. Importers can purchase customs yuan for application when paying taxes, using gold, silver, foreign currencies, or foreign exchange transfers from the Bank. The new customs yuan notes will be issued soon, and relevant parties have already started preparations. Before the war, customs duties were always paid using the customs gold unit system. Customs gold notes were also used as currency. After the last currency reform, they were abandoned along with legal tender. This time, the new customs gold notes avoid the name of customs gold and are renamed customs yuan, and it is determined that they shall not be circulated in the market except for paying customs duties.

### Open Trading of Gold and Silver; No More Arrests from Now On.

According to the Financial Management Bureau Director, after the announcement of the new economic plan, gold, silver, and silver dollars are allowed to circulate and trade freely. All activities previously entrusted to the police bureau to arrest black market gold and silver merchants and silver dollar vendors have been stopped since yesterday. Starting yesterday, gold, silver, and silver dollars can be freely traded and are no longer considered illegal. However, foreign currencies are not included in this category and are still prohibited from free trading. The bureau's future work will still focus on inspecting bank operations. Whether to abolish the bureau must await instructions from the Ministry of Finance.

### Evacuation of Prisoners Comes to an End

The Shanghai Prison's evacuation of prisoners has now come to an end. Most of those who meet the evacuation regulations have been released. Currently, only a few prisoners have not been released. The prison authorities stated that they will be released as soon as they find reliable guarantors.

### Military Units in Shanghai Ordered to Evacuate; Over a Hundred Units to Be Dispersed; Evacuation Work Scheduled to Be Completed Before March 10.

Association spokesperson Liu Dajie said yesterday: "This time, the government's treatment adjustment is 75 times in the Beijing-Shanghai area, and the base salary has increased slightly, but it is far from the association's requirement to multiply the original salary by the price index. Calculated according to the adjustment multiple, an assistant teacher and staff member with a monthly salary of 160 yuan will only receive 7,500 yuan per month, and even the highest-level professor with 600 yuan will only receive 16,000 yuan per month. Under the circumstances where daily necessities rise in price every day and water, electricity, and transportation costs increase several times a month, professors still cannot solve the minimum standard of living. The most bizarre thing is that this treatment adjustment did not mention the improvement number for the professor's monthly research fee of 50 yuan, which is clear evidence that the Ministry of Education despises academic research. Therefore, this association specifically requests the presidents of each school to go to Beijing to personally request Acting President Li to seek a reasonable solution to the treatment of faculty and staff. At the time when the new economic plan is being implemented, it is especially important to strive for a permanent and stable plan to improve treatment, which can be based on silver coins or in-kind standards. Never repeat the mistakes of the past where treatment was divorced from prices. The entire faculty of this association will fully support the presidents' hard work in going to Beijing this time. It is hoped that the presidents of each school will argue on the basis of reason and obtain a fundamental solution to this serious problem. As for the increase in recurring expenses and the supplementary issuance of contingency funds, these are urgent matters."

### Repeated Labor Unrest on Two Railways; Suspects of Incitement Arrested

[Our Reporter] It was recently learned from the military authorities that labor unrest has repeatedly occurred on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways. Several suspects of inciting the labor unrest have been arrested, including one commissioner from the two railway bureaus. The case is currently under active investigation and is said to be concluded within days.

### Lawsuit Against Railway Bureau for Occupying Housing: Plaintiff Wins After Yesterday's Trial and Verdict

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case in which Kang Jinzan sued the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration for occupying his property in Zhabei was concluded yesterday by Judge Ling Yuanqing of the District Court, and the verdict was pronounced: The defendant shall, within one year, return two sheet metal flat houses and twenty-five buildings located in the Xizhongyifang area of Wangjiazhai Road in Zhabei, Shanghai, to the plaintiff for self-demolition. The plaintiff's request for provisional execution was rejected. The defendant shall be responsible for the litigation costs.

According to the plaintiff's agent's statement to the Civil Division of the District Court: The land of over four mu in Xizhongyifang, Zhabei, together with the 25 buildings erected on it, are owned by the plaintiff. During the Anti-Japanese War, the enemy puppet Central China Railway Company forcibly occupied the property, removed the floorboards from all the buildings, transforming them into low flat houses for use as printing facilities. They also added two sheet metal flat houses on the remaining vacant land. After the victory, the defendant forcibly occupied and used the property. After returning to Shanghai after the war, the plaintiff presented the property certificate and applied to the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Industry Processing Bureau for its return. The bureau approved the return of the land and original buildings. Regarding the sheet metal houses built by the enemy, according to regulations, the bureau entrusted the China Trust Bureau to notify the land owner to purchase them. After the plaintiff paid the price, a certificate was issued transferring ownership to the plaintiff, and the defendant was notified to choose whether to purchase. Despite repeated written requests from the plaintiff for the defendant to return the property, the defendant ignored them, claiming that the aforementioned land and fixtures were subject to a requisition plan drafted by the two railway bureaus, which had been submitted for approval and allowed for prior use after negotiation of a lease. The plaintiff rejected this claim and filed a lawsuit requesting a judgment ordering the defendant to return the aforementioned property and a declaration for provisional execution.

Upon discovery, the entire amount was intercepted by the Tilanqiao Police Station, and the original items have been recovered by the bureau without any losses. All offenders have been transferred to the court for prosecution.

### Mr. Anonymous: Sincere Words; Raises 2.5 Million Yuan While Ill; Exceeds the Target for Shen Bao's Student Aid Fund

The benevolent "Mr. Anonymous," the student aid elder, recently donated one million gold yuan to this newspaper's "Reader Student Aid Fund," eliciting great sympathy and respect from the people of Shanghai. However, given this newspaper's target of five million gold yuan, it was not easy to reach the full amount immediately. Feeling concerned about the possibility that hundreds of students might have to abandon their studies and in anticipation of aid, the elder personally raised another 2.5 million yuan to supplement this newspaper's student aid fund, bringing this year's student aid campaign to a successful conclusion. His sincere concern for the poor students and his generous donation deeply moved the staff of this newspaper. We respectfully express our gratitude on behalf of the hundreds of impoverished students. Yesterday, we received another letter from Mr. Anonymous, which was full of sincerity and deeply inspiring. The original text is as follows:

To the Editors of Shen Bao,

Regarding the student aid fund for this semester organized by your newspaper, the original target was 500 shi of white rice, or 5 million gold yuan. Based on past performance, this target is not considered large. I recall that during the Anti-Japanese War, your newspaper raised enough student aid funds to support as many as 4,000 impoverished students each year. Now, we only hope to save one-tenth of that number, or 400 students, but it is still difficult to achieve this goal. I cannot help but feel deeply moved. In order to follow your newspaper's call, I donated one million gold yuan on the 21st of this month, bringing the total to 2.5 million yuan, half of the original target. The remaining 2.5 million yuan is still lacking. I hope that your newspaper can generate widespread support and achieve the target through vocal appeals. But as of today, the impoverished students who need help are eagerly anticipating aid. Every day, I read your newspaper and cannot help but feel saddened and uneasy. I had no choice but to appeal to friends despite being ill, and I raised 1.25 million gold yuan from Mr. Ding of Guangyu Tang, 600,000 gold yuan from the combined donation of Hongji, Zuoji, and Guanji, and 650,000 gold yuan from the combined donation of Mingji and Heji, totaling 2.5 million gold yuan. I am sending this to you for receipt so that the impoverished students whose applications have been approved can feel at ease and focus on their studies. Through your newspaper, the original target can be achieved, the mission of serving society can be fulfilled, and I can also fulfill my wish for this year's student aid. Sincerely, Mr. Anonymous, February 5th, Year 38.

The deadline for this newspaper's student aid fund is the end of this month as scheduled. If you wish to donate, please send your donations within the next three days. Although this year's target has been achieved, rescuing students from dropping out is always beneficial, no matter how much.

### Group of Shandong Refugee Students to Leave Shanghai Next Tuesday

### Railway Bureau Restricts "Dan Bang" Activities; Requires Tickets to Be Used on the Scheduled Train

[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to alleviate passenger congestion, restrict "dan bang" (small-scale smuggling) activities, and control the number of passengers on trains, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration has decided to change the rules for the use of passenger tickets starting tomorrow. From now on, each passenger ticket is only valid for the train it is scheduled for and cannot be used on the next train. Passengers who purchase ordinary passenger tickets are not allowed to switch to express trains and pay the express train fare on board. The railway bureau will also strictly regulate the number of passenger tickets sold for each train and will no longer sell tickets once the limit is reached. "Dan bang" passengers are encouraged to use ordinary passenger trains. Therefore, it has been decided that each ordinary ticket can be used to purchase two baggage tickets to show preference.

### St. John's and Korean Basketball Teams: Men and Women Both Win

The movie stars who played were Jin Yan, Ling Qihao, Shi Hui, Han Fei, Wang Xuewu, etc. Cai Lianke and Zhang Gengsheng also helped out in the second half, but they still could not turn the tide. The players for St. John's were Tao Yingshi, Sun Moses, Zhang Qirong, Sun Guozheng, Huang Tianlie, Qian Shijun, Wu Liangjun, Hu Huizhao, etc. In the women's game, St. John's women's team won against an unnamed team from a neighboring middle school.

### Tonight's Races at the Canidrome: Hweili vs. Perfil

Tonight's main event in the basketball league is Hweili vs. Perfil. Hweili's new players have returned, and their recent condition is excellent, so the situation has improved. Tonight, they will face the American team Perfil, and it is hoped that they can continue their winning streak. However, the American team is not weak, so they cannot be too careless. The other two games will be a women's game and a Class 2 group game. Ticket prices remain the same. The lineup is as follows:

Li Team vs. Li Team (Women's Group) 5:30 PM

Perfil vs. Ping Ping (Class 2C) 6:15 PM

Hweili vs. Perfil (Class 1 Group) 7:15 PM

The women's teams will take the court first, with Li Team facing Li Team. Both sides are in the final game of the first round. Li Team has already suffered at the hands of Lu Team, Xinghua, and St. John's, and they will find it difficult to escape defeat today. However, the entire team has an excellent sporting spirit. Although they have lost, they are not discouraged and continue to fight hard, which is commendable. Li Team has two wins and one loss. They defeated Xinghua last week, which was not easy. They have a good chance of securing a runner-up spot. Victory today is certain.

In Class 2C, Tarul faces Ping Ping. The former defeated Pang Team and has great fighting power. Although Ping Ping is led by veterans Wang Zhengjun and Xia Zhiong, it may be difficult to blunt its momentum.

In Class 1, Hweili faces Perfil for the first time. Although the American team has lost all five games, they have not lost by much each time. For example, they only lost to Hualian by five points, to Renyu by four points, and to Haiqing by half a goal, which shows that they are not to be trifled with. Hweili has played six games, with half wins and half losses. They recently defeated Encas, which shows their skills. The entire team is fast-paced, and the recent return of Ye Yunshan and Chen Zhengmiao has boosted their morale. It is expected that they will give the foreign soldiers a severe lesson.

Each side sent four players to compete, adopting the international competition system. The Gas Company also had the assistance of the female player Cai Xiuyu, whose skills were no weaker than the Jewish players. However, due to a lack of practice, she was unable to endure a long battle, starting strong but fading later. Fortunately, the all-rounder Li Zhen performed excellently, winning four matches and laying the foundation for the Gas Company's victory. As a result, the Gas Company narrowly defeated the Jewish team by a score of 9 to 7.

### Commodity Market Fluctuates Sharply After New Financial Program Announced; National Bank Sells Gold and Foreign Exchange, Slowing the Rising Trend

[Report from Our Newspaper] The commodity market in this city experienced a strong reaction after the new financial program was published in the newspaper yesterday. Taking financial commodities that lead prices as an example, the price of gold reached a maximum of 155,000 yuan per tael, but the minimum price in the afternoon was only 138,000 yuan. The peak of the US dollar reached 3,100 yuan, and the minimum price in the afternoon was around 2,780 yuan. The market conditions for other general essential commodities rose rapidly in the morning, weakened in the afternoon, and eventually narrowed. For example, the peak of white rice was 16,000 yuan per shi, and the closing price was 14,000 yuan; 20s Shuangma reached a maximum of 520,000 yuan, and the closing price was 460,000 yuan; coarse granulated sugar peaked at 27,000 yuan, and the closing price was 24,000 yuan; rayon peaked at 700,000 yuan, and the low price was 625,000 yuan; and British American Tobacco cigarettes peaked at 3,000 yuan, and the low price was around 2,800 yuan. Solid soap peaked at 24,000 yuan, and the closing price was 22,000 yuan. The feature of yesterday's market was that the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates actually exceeded that of the US dollar. Because trade controls have been relaxed in the new program, except for oil and tobacco, all are not included in the quota. Therefore, the market scrambled to exchange US dollars for foreign exchange settlement certificates. Due to the relationship between supply and demand, the price of US dollars was lower than that of transfer certificates. Another main reason for the price decline yesterday was the Central Bank's sale of more than 1,500 gold bars in addition to foreign exchange settlement certificates. The money supply tightened, and people panicked. Therefore, the soaring trend, which was like a raging fire, was slightly suppressed.

### Hua Shares Turned Down at the Close

New Prices Seen Repeatedly in Opening

The new financial reform program was announced and implemented yesterday. The buying and selling of gold and silver is allowed to be free, and the Central Bank is responsible for leveling the prices. People are still optimistic about stocks. The money supply has been loosened, and buying has been rampant, with new prices seen repeatedly. At the opening, Taiwan Sugar immediately reported a limit-up. Within half an hour, Yonggong, Huafeng, Xinya, Zhenqi, Jingfu, Xinhua, Xinyi, Qinxing, and Zhongni all rose to their limit-up levels. There was limited trading at the limit. Those who made profits during the mid-session sold, and peers also sold, and the steady state was stagnant. Before the close, rumors spread that the Central Bank was selling gold, and the money supply stopped loosening and turned tight. The buying interest waned. Floating longs sold in panic, and the downward trend intensified. Yongsha, Meiya, Tongyi, Rongfeng, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Match all closed at the lowest prices of the session, falling from half a corner to two corners compared with the previous day. Other stocks that were not traded at the close continued to rise by 3% to 24%. Taiwan Sugar alone rose by 1,610 yuan. Trading in various stocks was still strong, reaching a total of 4.6972 billion shares in half a day, including 197 million shares of Yongsha.

### Principal Repayment of Gold Bonds to Be Drawn on March 2

The first drawing for the principal repayment of the first phase of gold bonds is scheduled to be held on March 2. All sold bonds have been exchanged for formal bonds by the original sales bank from the 23rd with previously issued reservation coupons, and all exchanges are limited to completion before today (the 26th).

Also reported: The National Bank's listed price for short-term gold bonds continued to rise yesterday, set at 100,850 yuan per two-tael denomination.

### China Textile and Construction Continues to Sell; The Yarn Market Saw Both Rises and Falls

[Report from Our Newspaper] China Textile and Construction Company continued to list yarn for sale in the market yesterday, but there were few buyers, so it was only sold once. As a result, only 50 pieces were sold. Only 20 households applied to purchase, worth 31.98 million yuan. The opening price for each type of yarn: 6s subsidiary Sun, no one applied, price 190,000 yuan. 32s Xiantao 23 pieces, price 540,000 yuan. 32s Double Twist Happy Crane 10 pieces, price 630,000 yuan. 42s Leaf Twist Mercerized Colored Ball 17 pieces, price 780,000 yuan.

Also, the company routinely sold yarn to the replication industry yesterday, offering a total of ten types, selling 168 pieces, approving 69 households to purchase, worth 111.86 million yuan. The opening price for each type of yarn: 20s Hongfu 380,000 yuan, 16s Red Moon 360,000 yuan, 20s Double Twist Blue Phoenix 455,000 yuan, 32s Sunlight 530,000 yuan, 32s Double Twist Harvest Year 650,000 yuan, 40s Red Treasure Light 660,000 yuan, 42s Double Twist Dragon Gate 670,000 yuan, 40s Three Twist Red Real Light 680,000 yuan, 60s Palace Maid 950,000 yuan, 80s Double Twist TK Colored Ball 2.1 million yuan.

The yarn market presented a wavering situation. At the opening in the morning, due to the significant increase in recent days, people were wary of high prices, and many retail investors sold, reducing the market price compared to before. Afterwards, because the prices of all non-industry items were strong, and the money supply was still loose, the market returned to rising, resulting in more gains than losses. 42s Blue Phoenix rose all the way from 685,000 yuan to 740,000 yuan at closing, rising by 20,000 yuan. 40s Blue Phoenix was up 15,000 yuan, 32s Silver Moon rose from 565,000 yuan to a maximum of 585,000 yuan, and then retreated to 570,000 yuan at noon closing, down 10,000 yuan. 21s Double Horse appeared at an opening of 480,000 yuan, up 10,000 yuan from before, but finally retreated to 450,000 yuan, down 10,000 yuan, with the next day's price at 465,000 yuan. 20s Double Horse fell slightly by 5,000 yuan, ending at 430,000 yuan. In addition, Jincheng Xing Tiannv and others also made small gains, and all grades below 16s also rose slightly. There were not many transactions in other yarns, and the market price fluctuated narrowly.

### Cotton Cloth Prices Soar; New Prices Repeatedly Seen in the Market

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market reached its peak. With the money supply still loose and people increasingly excited, various cloths showed unprecedented new highs amid the soaring prices. At the opening, the leading fine cloth was 19,500 yuan, and the Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji was 18,300 yuan. Retail investors raised prices one after another, and the prices soared. The former once rose to 20,700 yuan, and the latter to 19,800 yuan. By the time of the noon closing, it was heard that the black market had weakened, and the market price slightly declined. The closing price for fine cloth was 19,700 yuan, and the Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji was 18,700 yuan, jumping 1,700 yuan to 2,550 yuan higher than before. Trumpet Boy fine cloth rose from 18,100 yuan to a maximum of 19,000 yuan, and finally closed at 18,300 yuan, rising by 2,300 yuan. B Leading fine cloth finally closed at 19,200 yuan, up 3,400 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong rose by 2,800 yuan, ending at 18,900 yuan. In addition, the factory prices of 190 Shilin and Yuan cloth, etc., were all increased by about 15%.

### Impact of Rising Gold Prices on the Rice Market: Surge in Prices

Rice prices soared dramatically yesterday. At the market's opening, due to the sharp rise in gold prices, sellers raised their prices. Later, as gold prices rapidly declined, the rice market was nearing its close, so the price increases still prevailed. In the Southern Rice Market, Bai Geng (white polished rice) once reached 15,000 yuan, and Bo Dao (thin rice) also exceeded 15,000 yuan. When news of the gold price drop arrived, the market weakened slightly. At the close, Bai Geng was at 14,600 yuan, and Bo Dao was at the same price as Bai Geng, an increase of 3,200-3,300 yuan compared to the previous day. Early rice and glutinous rice prices uniformly rose by about 30%. In the Northern Rice Market, Bai Geng and Bo Dao rose by 3,800 to 3,000 yuan. The total arrivals at both markets were 6,660 shi (a unit of dry measure).

Cooking Oil: Trading opened very late. Due to the fluctuating gold prices, the market sentiment remained calm, and prices remained stable. The opening price was slightly higher than the previous day by 3,000-4,000 yuan. The closing price eventually followed the gold price down slightly, resulting in a flat day compared to the previous day. Soybean oil opened at 58,000 yuan and closed at 55,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil was at 51,000 yuan, unchanged from the previous day. Jiangbei pure raw oil opened at 60,000 yuan in the morning. Soybean cakes initially rose but then declined, ultimately weakening.

Flour: Initially firm, then declined. At the start, due to the continued loose monetary policy and the sharp rise in gold, paper money, and rice prices, market sentiment was extremely bullish. Old military ship flour once broke through the 6,000 mark. Later, due to the small declines in prices of other commodities and rumors of the Central Bank releasing a large amount of gold, it was widely expected that the silver market would tighten sharply, and sellers rushed to sell.
