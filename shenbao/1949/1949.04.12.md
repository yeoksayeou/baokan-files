### The Government Will Issue a Statement on the Current Situation / Representatives of the Peace Talks Meet with Mao Zedong / Detailed Discussions Approach Core Issues

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] According to reliable sources, the government will issue a statement on the current situation in the near future. The statement is currently being drafted by the Executive Yuan and will be finalized soon.

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] Acting President Li continued to receive phone calls from Peiping on the 11th, reiterating that the Chinese Communists had issued an order on the 10th to cease military offensives with immediate effect. At the same time, it was reported that the delegation in Peiping had made contact with the representatives of the Chinese Communists: Chief Delegate Zhang Zhizhong had a four-hour long conversation with Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM on the 8th. Zhang Shizhao and Shao Lizi met with Mao Zedong on the 9th, also holding lengthy talks for several hours. On the 10th, all the delegates met with Mao Zedong. Although formal peace talks have not yet begun, the exchange of opinions on various issues is very close, and the eight conditions are no longer insisted upon.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] It is reliably learned that Chief Delegate of the Peace Talks Delegation, Zhang Zhizhong, had a four-hour long conversation with Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong on the 8th. Representatives Zhang Shizhao and Shao Lizi met with Mao Zedong on the 9th and had very detailed discussions on various issues, gradually approaching the core issues.

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] During the peace talks, the "Third Force" has been making great efforts in both Peiping and Nanking. In addition to sending representatives to Nanking to express their opinions, they are also acting as intermediaries in Peiping. The Chinese Communist order to cease military offensives is a result of the efforts of the "Third Force". The person who notified Acting President Li of this via telephone from Peiping at 10:00 PM on the 10th was also a member of the "Third Force".

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] After the Chinese Communists ordered a cessation of military offensives, according to news received on the 11th, although there were still some engagements on the front lines, the trend towards a cessation seems to be growing. However, this is only the Chinese Communists ceasing their offensives. The National Army has not taken offensive action for a long time, so there is no need for the government to consider issuing a similar order. On the 11th, it was rumored that the Ministry of National Defense had also issued a ceasefire order, but after inquiring with Chief of the General Staff Gu Zhutong, it was confirmed to be untrue.

### Senior Government Officials to Go to Peiping / Chinese Communists Express Welcome / Yu Youren Largely Agrees to Go North

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] Yu Youren, Zhang Qun, Wu Zhongxin and other four senior officials will accept the invitation of Acting President Li and go to Peiping within three to five days to assist in the progress of the peace talks. Acting President Li personally went to great lengths for this matter. He went to Yu Youren's residence at 6:00 PM on the 11th to explain that he had received a long-distance phone call from the "Third Force" in Peiping on the evening of the 10th, urging Yu and others to go to Peiping as soon as possible. The Acting President said in the phone call that with the war on the Yangtze River line approaching, Yu Youren would not be able to come. The person replied that the Chinese Communists had agreed to order a cessation of military offensives. The Acting President also promised to invite Yu Youren to set out immediately. Before explaining this matter, the Acting President specifically told him that the Chinese Communists had ordered a cessation of military offensives. On the 11th, many Legislative and Supervisory Committee members visited Yu Youren throughout the day, most of them urging him to go to Peiping. When Yu Youren met with reporters at 8:00 PM, he said: "Except for a small reservation, I have agreed."

### The Chongqing Warship's Defection is Due to Negligence / Gui Yongqing is Removed from Office but Retained / The President Issues an Order of Admonishment and Observation

[Central News Agency (North Branch), Nanjing, 11th] President's order of April 11th: It is found that in the case of the defection of the Chongqing warship on February 25th of this year, Naval Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing was negligent in prevention beforehand, and the personnel management of the warship was also inadequate, which is indeed due to negligence. However, considering that the Commander-in-Chief has held military positions for a long time and has always been known for his merits, and that the defection of the warship occurred during a patrol, and prevention was not possible, lenient treatment should be given. He is hereby removed from office but retained, to show admonishment and observe future performance. This is the order.

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] Supervisory Committee members Cao Dexuan and Lu Fengge investigated the Chongqing warship defection case and have filed an impeachment against Gui Yongqing, which has been reviewed and established. The reason for the impeachment is that Gui should be held responsible for the defection of the Chongqing warship. The impeachment states that Gui used the navy to engage in factional struggles as a means of control. Old cadres of the Qingdao faction were squeezed out, and recently, young members of the Qingdao faction were used to exclude the Mawei faction. Factional friction formed a long-term cause of the Chongqing warship defection. The dismissal of Deng Zhaoxiang and the replacement with the young and inexperienced Lu Dongge, Deng's request to become a member of the Legal System Committee was denied, only to be appointed as the deputy director of the First Department, and forced him to stay on the ship for two months for handover, which was the immediate cause of the Chongqing warship defection.

### Fang Dong and Shen Xirui Firmly Decline New Positions

### The Situation on the Zhenjiang Front Turns to Ease / Communist Troops North of the Yangtze Retreat Slightly / Small Group of Communist Troops Crosses the Yangtze River to the Southwest of Yangzhou

[Our Zhenjiang Office, 11th] The situation on the Zhenjiang front has eased. No artillery fire has been heard from the bridgehead positions north of the Yangtze River in the past 24 hours. All the first-line troops of the Communist army have retreated north by about five to eight li, which is obviously the impact of the ceasefire order. The Communist troops attacking Liuwei have retreated from Laosiwei, Zhujia flagpole, to the line of Tangjiaqiao, Majiawan, and Shijiaqiao to reorganize. The Communist troops north of Guazhou have retreated from Houhuayuan and Balipu to Huayuanzhuang. The majority of the 26th Army of the 8th Corps of the Communist troops attacking Shierwei from three sides have retreated to the Liuzhuang and Chenzhuang area north of Xincheng. Xincheng has now become a vacuum zone. The National Army has not pursued the retreating Communist troops. In addition, the Ding Zuobin unit of the National Army stationed in Liuwei has been ordered to return to the south of the Yangtze River to reorganize and replenish, and another army will take over the defense of Liuwei. The Longwokou area is still firmly defended by the National Army.

[Our Zhenjiang Office, 11th] Lin Zun, commander of the Second Fleet of the Navy stationed in Zhenjiang, telegraphed the headquarters of the Navy on the 11th, requesting the allocation of warships and gunboats to Zhenjiang to assist the National Army in defending the bridgeheads north of the Yangtze River.

[Our Zhenjiang Office, 11th] A part of the Communist troops in Sanjiangying, in coordination with local Communist bandits, attacked Daqiao Town (at the junction of Zhenjiang and Yangzhou) in the first district of Zhenjiang County on the night of the 7th. After the local militia calmly responded, the Communist troops reinforced the attack with four more regiments on the night of the 10th. Due to the disparity in numbers, the local militia has taken the initiative to retreat to Dagang.

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] According to the Military News Agency: (1) An air force reconnaissance report stated that dozens of wooden boats carrying a small group of Communist troops crossed the Yangtze River from Sanjiangying in the afternoon of the 11th and occupied the vicinity of the 24th and 79th Weirs in the southwest and northwest of Yangzhou. The National Army has dispatched troops to suppress them. (2) The fighting at Huazikou eased in the afternoon of the 10th. On the 11th, the National Army counterattacked eastward, killing and wounding more than 100 Communist troops. The situation in the area is stable. (3) The Communist troops attacking Guazhou, Liuwei, and Ershierwei across the Yangtze River from Zhenjiang retreated slightly to the north in the afternoon of the 10th, leaving a part to fight against the National Army.

### Ma Hongkui and His Wife Arrive in Nanjing / Says He Does Not Understand the Peiping-Style Peace / Speaks of the People's Livelihood During the Conversation

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] Ningxia Chairman Ma Hongkui, in response to the telegram from Acting President Li, arrived in Nanjing by special plane from Ningxia at 1:30 PM on the 11th with his wife, Ms. Liu Muxia. Acting President Li sent representative Liu Shiyi to welcome them. After getting off the plane, Ma went to No. 2 Ninghai Road to rest and met with Legislative and Supervisory Committee members from Ningxia. In the evening at 6:00 PM, Chief Bai Chongxi visited and had a long conversation for about an hour before leaving after dinner at 8:00 PM. According to Ma's statement to our reporter, peace is what the people of the whole country yearn for. Turning hostility into friendship and saving the people from fire and water is necessary today. If peace can succeed, it is what everyone hopes for. When the reporter asked his opinion on Fu Zuoyi's Peiping-style peace, Ma avoided answering, saying that he did not understand the situation in Peiping, but asked in a rhetorical tone: "Mr. Fu and I are very good friends. We are both soldiers, and military affairs are our profession, but we always inevitably do a poor job in politics. This time, Mr. Fu probably had some shortcomings in his advance planning, right?" When the reporter mentioned Fu Zuoyi's telegram on April 1, Ma asked in a doubtful tone: "Is it true?" Later, Ma also said that we have very good Three Principles of the People, but unfortunately we have not been able to implement them. If we could implement them, we would not need the Communist Party to liberate us. The weather is getting warmer, and we will take off our leather pants. Why don't we liberate ourselves?" During the conversation, Ma was quite concerned about the people's livelihood. He said that it is no longer the era of feudal warlords, and everything should be for the sake of the people's lives. This time he came to Nanjing, he plans to stay for a few days, in addition to visiting Acting President Li, he also plans to treat his illness.

Ma is scheduled to visit Acting President Li at 9:00 AM on the 12th and Premier He at 11:00 AM. Acting President Li will host a banquet for Ma at 7:00 PM on the evening of the 12th.

### Wuhan Garrison Commander Speaks of Comprehensive Arrangements on the Periphery

[Our Hankou Office, 10th] (Delayed) Wuhan Garrison Commander Lu Daoyuan met with our reporter today and said that although the outer defense line of Wuhan is becoming increasingly tight, we have comprehensive arrangements. The city defense works here are also very solid. It is not easy for the Communist army to launch an offensive against Hankou in the lake and swamp area. Moreover, strategically, the importance of the bridgeheads on the east and west sides is greater than that of Hankou. Although the pressure from the Communist army has increased, peace talks have not been abandoned. The safety of Wuhan in the short term should be guaranteed. Citizens do not need to panic each other, and those who have the ability to evacuate automatically can be allowed to do so freely, and there is no need to restrict or interfere at this time.

### The Battle in Eastern Hubei Approaches the Riverbank / The National Army Completes Deployment Between Xiaogan and Huangpi / The Communist Offensive Against Wuhu Across the River Has Been Thwarted

[Our Hankou Office, 11th] Military news: After the Communist troops deployed troops in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, they controlled some strongholds on the west side of the railway south of Anlu to Yummeng, controlling the back of Xiaogan; on the other hand, they crossed the important sites of Hekouzhen and Songbu on the east side of the railway to peep into Huangpi and threaten the right wing of Wuhan. The National Army on the front has adapted to this situation. There has been no major change in the online situation for ten days, and the Communist army's actions seem to be waiting for something. However, in eastern Hubei, after the Communist troops successively captured Xishui and Huangmei, the battle has approached the Jiangbei bridgehead. In order to strengthen the river defense, the Navy has deployed several ships to increase the defense of Wuxue and Tianjiazhen, from 蕲水 to the Guanxi Town river surface. At the same time, the local Communist bandits in central and western Hubei also have a southward movement, and the development in the next few days is very noteworthy.

[Our Huangpi Office, 10th] (Delayed) A certain strong army corps guarding the three towns of Wuhan has used the complex terrain outside Hankou, relying on strong fortifications, to complete a new deployment. The front line on the east side of the Pinghan Railway in Huangpi, the front of Pinghan in Sanjiaobu, and the west bank of the Fuhe River in the area bordering Xiaogan, Yingcheng, and Hanchuan have completed the northern, eastern, and western front lines of Hankou.

(2) More than 10,000 Communist troops moving south from Huayuan in the Pinghan area arrived north of Xiaojiagang, and some have sneaked to the east side of the railway and joined the 43rd Army of Lin Biao's troops moving south along the Luo (Shan) Huang (Pi) Highway west of Zhangxuanling. The Communist troops tried to harass the territory of Huangpi County last night and arrived near Wangjiapeng, 30 miles northwest of Huangpi this morning. (3) More than 3,000 Communist troops who had sneaked to Putan, south of Xiaogan Ding, that night opened to the area west of Sanjiaobu, seemingly attempting to destroy the railway between Xiaogan and Hengdian.

(4) More than 20,000 Communist troops approaching Songbu from Baoguan Station and Baiguo southwest of Macheng arrived at Liuzigang southwest of Songbu yesterday. Some of the National Army in Songbu have moved to Xinzhou (about 50 kilometers from Hankou), and are working with the National Army retreating from the area between Macheng and Huangpi to block the Communist troops invading from the south. (5) The 38th Division of the 13th Army of the Communist troops who sneaked into Xishui in eastern Hubei continued to attack Suxizhen, the bridgehead on the riverbank in eastern Hubei, yesterday, and are engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army. In addition, the Communist troops of Chen Geng's Corps 15th Army, which sneaked into Huangmei County from Yingshan and Taihu, continued to move westward yesterday, isolating Guang'an on the edge of Bieshan, and the situation is tense. (6) After Lin Biao's troops occupied Huayuan, they are actively conscripting civilians to repair the Xiang (Yang) Hua (Yuan) Highway, and plan to widen the road surface. The road passes west through Anlu, Suixian, and Zhaoyang, and can reach Xiangyang from Anlu via Yunmeng, Yingcheng, Jingshan, and Zhongxiang and to Jingmen.

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] Military News Agency: The Communist offensive in the Liangshan, Yuxikou, and Erba areas across the river from Wuhu has been slightly thwarted on the morning of the 11th.

Improving the treatment of public school teachers: The Legislative Yuan has a special discussion on this matter, and this proposal will be postponed; 3. The establishment of a deposit fund management committee is related to the banking system and will be transferred to the Central Bank Organization Law Amendment Review and merged for discussion. (2) The Economic Data Committee, the Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Committee, and the Legal System Committee jointly reviewed the Organization Law of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the morning and decided not to establish a Fisheries Department, but to add a fisheries and animal husbandry item to the business of the Agriculture and Forestry Department. The Resources Committee was renamed the Resources Bureau, and the Agriculture and Forestry Department and the Water Conservancy Department maintained the original plan. (3) The Foreign Affairs Committee reviewed the foreign affairs-related parts of Premier He's policy guidelines and the proposal to review the current foreign policy in the afternoon, and exchanged opinions widely without reaching a conclusion.

### Two Legislators Suddenly Arrested: Jin Shaoxian Released the Same Night, Xu Wentian Brought to Shanghai; President He Inquires About Details, Orders Investigators Escorted to Beijing

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 11th] Legislators Xu Wentian and Jin Shaoxian were suddenly arrested at the Wenfeng Bookstore around 2 p.m. on the 10th and taken to the Garrison Headquarters. Xu Wentian was immediately sent to Shanghai, while Jin Shaoxian was released at 11:30 p.m. on the 10th. The case was handled directly by personnel dispatched from Shanghai. Those arrested before and after included Peng Juntao, manager of Wenfeng Bookstore, as well as several staff and workers. By midnight on the 10th, all those arrested except Xu Wentian and two others had been released on bail.

[Our Beijing Dispatch of the 11th] After receiving reports of the arrest of legislators Xu Wentian and Jin Shaoxian on the morning of the 11th, President He Yingqin discussed the matter at length with President Tong Guanxian and Secretary-General Chen Kewen of the Legislative Yuan. He then summoned Zhang Yaoming to inquire about the details of the arrest. He separately telegraphed Tang Enbo and Zhang Yaoming, ordering them to immediately escort Xu Wentian, who had been taken to Shanghai, back to Beijing, and to escort the personnel handling the case to Beijing for questioning.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 11th] The details of the arrest of legislator Xu Wentian are quite complex. Relevant authorities have refused to explain the reasons, but it is rumored to be related to the Farmers' and Workers' News Agency. The agency's address is upstairs from the Wenfeng Bookstore where Xu and others were arrested.

Jin Shaoxian Recounts His Experience From Arrest to Release

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 11th] Legislator Jin Shaoxian described to our reporter in detail on the afternoon of the 11th his experience of being arrested and released on the 10th, as follows: Around 12 p.m. on the 10th, Jin was returning from visiting a friend and met Xu Wentian near Hankou Road. They immediately took a rickshaw back to the Central Hotel. After passing Daxing Palace, Xu said he intended to visit legislator Chen Xiaosen at Wenfeng Bookstore. Jin, thinking it was not far from the Central Hotel, got out of the rickshaw at the same time and followed Xu into Wenfeng Bookstore to browse the displayed books while waiting. He saw someone ask Xu when he went upstairs, "Who are you looking for?" Xu said, "Committee member Chen." However, Xu seemed to sense that the person asking the question looked different and hesitated slightly, intending to go back. The questioner suddenly changed his demeanor and did not allow Xu to leave. Xu showed his legislator attendance card, saying he was a legislator. They said, "We are acting on orders," and then two or three people took Xu away. At the same time, someone questioned Jin. Jin thought it had nothing to do with him, but the questioner asked Jin to come upstairs. It was about 3 p.m. when Jin went upstairs. He saw several officers and soldiers inside. Because he had an appointment, he wanted to make a phone call, but was not allowed. Jin stayed upstairs for about a quarter of an hour before being escorted to the guard unit of the Garrison Headquarters by two plainclothes officers. There were already more than ten men and women being held there, including Xu Wentian, who was in handcuffs. They were speechless to each other. Then Chief Staff Officer Chen came to talk, saying that he was acting on orders and that the important one was Xu Wentian. As for what to do with Jin Shaoxian, he had to ask Shanghai for instructions. Jin interceded for Xu, saying that he was just a scholar, so why put him in handcuffs? Could they please remove them? Chen refused. Jin then asked to call Zhang Yaoming. Chen replied that Zhang had no jurisdiction and that the matter was being handled on orders from Shanghai. Jin said that according to the Constitution, legislators could not be arbitrarily arrested and that it would be best to let the superiors know. Chen said, "I know," but still did not consider the phone call to Zhang. Chen then called Shanghai to ask for instructions, but the person in charge was not there. Chen took Xu Wentian and two others away. Before leaving, he handed Jin over to the guard unit leader of the Garrison Headquarters to watch. At this time, the situation seemed to have eased, and the guard was more relaxed. Jin took the opportunity to talk to those who had been arrested together and learned that the Wenfeng Bookstore had been under surveillance for two or three days. Those arrested included the manager, staff, and workers of Wenfeng Bookstore, who had all been interrogated severely. At that time, people were successively released on bail, and there were still two people who were providing bail. The guards said, "Don't worry, you will definitely be released today." Waiting until about 11 p.m., it seemed that they had received a call from Shanghai, approving Jin's release. The guards said that others had to provide bail, but Jin was a legislator and did not need to provide bail, but asked Jin to keep the matter a secret after going out and not to tell others about what happened. Jin refused, preferring to continue to be held. They considered it for a long time, and finally released Jin at 11:30 p.m.

Acting President Li Sends Personnel to Express Condolences

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 11th] Legislator Jin Shaoxian, who was arrested on the 10th and released the same day, visited Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian and Executive Yuan President He Yingqin on the morning of the 11th to explain what happened, and telephoned Acting President Li. Acting President Li sent legislator Qiu Changwei to Jin's residence at 4:30 p.m. to inquire about what happened and express his condolences. President Tong said that he hoped President He could attend the Legislative Yuan meeting to explain the matter. When Jin met He Yingqin, He said that he knew nothing about it beforehand and had asked Garrison Commander Zhang Yaoming, who also said he did not know. Jin made three requests to He: (1) Xu Wentian's health is weak, and he hopes to be released quickly; (2) the safety of legislators is threatened, and he hopes to take effective measures to protect them; (3) whether his personal safety will be a problem, and he hopes to be protected. He replied: Xu Wentian has been ordered to be escorted back to Beijing quickly, the safety of legislators will be protected as much as possible, and he believes that Jin's personal safety will not be a problem, but he still agreed to study concrete measures.

Xu and Jin's Arrest to Be Discussed at Legislative Yuan Today

President He Invited to Attend and Report

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 11th] Legislators were extremely agitated upon learning of the arrest of Xu Wentian and Jin Shaoxian on the 10th, considering it a "violation of the Constitution," because Article 34 of the Constitution stipulates that "Legislators shall not be arrested or detained without the permission of the Legislative Yuan, except in cases of flagrante delicto." Xu and Jin were arrested while visiting friends, which does not constitute "flagrante delicto," and the Legislative Yuan had not received any notification before the arrest. Around 9 a.m. on the 11th, dozens of legislators went to the Legislative Yuan to visit President Tong Guanxian, asking him to immediately find a way to rescue them and correct this unconstitutional situation. It was decided to bring it up for discussion at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 12th, and to invite Executive Yuan President He Yingqin to attend the Legislative Yuan meeting that day to report on the arrest. At the same time, Tong Guanxian was pushed to visit He Yingqin immediately to negotiate the release of Xu Wentian.

### Editorial: Develop the City's Industry and Commerce!

The Shanghai Municipal Government held an industry and commerce symposium on the morning of the 10th to analyze the current economic situation and explore a smooth path for the development of the city's industry and commerce in a difficult environment. The participants in the symposium were all leaders of the city's industry and commerce, who spoke out one after another and put forward good opinions on the rights and wrongs of the current economic phenomena. They saw the current economic crisis lurking everywhere, such as: (1) The recent daily and nightly price increases, with prices rising several times in one day; (2) Interest rates so high that they were frightening, stifling legitimate industry and commerce; (3) Lack of raw material sources, making it almost impossible to reproduce after selling finished products; (4) The dwindling reserves of food, fuel, and other daily necessities, threatening the lives of citizens; (5) Stagnant sales of finished products, with a depression occurring despite high prices. Therefore, they unanimously believed that if the city's industry and commerce were to be developed, it was necessary to immediately implement the exchange of materials between the North and the South. Therefore, it was decided that more than a dozen units of relevant industry and commerce agencies would organize a North-South Material Exchange Design Committee to seek the early realization of North-South material exchange.

Since the opening of price limits in November last year, prices have risen all the way, almost without end; but the depression of industry and commerce has always existed. This deformed phenomenon is almost impossible to explain with economic theory. In theory, economic prosperity is a natural phenomenon during periods of high prices, and economic depression only occurs when there is overproduction and prices fall. In the era of the old legal tender, the faster the inflation, the higher the prices rose, and under the principle of "a rising tide lifts all boats," general industry and commerce also showed a prosperous scene, although it was a superficial prosperity, it could still barely be maintained. But now, on the one hand, high prices make consumers feel threatened in their lives; on the other hand, economic depression makes general industry and commerce feel the pain of wanting to die but not being able to live.

There are certainly many reasons for this deformed phenomenon; but the most important reasons are, first, the cost of production is too high, and most of the raw materials come from abroad, because the price of foreign exchange certificates has risen sharply, exceeding the multiple of price increases; after the finished products are sold, the raw materials cannot be replenished, and reproduction is impossible. Even in terms of domestic raw materials, the speed of raw material price increases is often above that of finished products due to the continuation of the war and the difficulty of transportation. Second, the oppression of usury makes industry and commerce unable to bear the burden of interest, and the cheap sale of income cannot be reproduced, so there is only the way of tightening and stopping work.

The continued existence of this phenomenon will not only make industrialists and businessmen have no way out, but also affect the general salaried class who depend on the "cost of living index" to make a living. The disconnect between the "cost of living index" and prices is already a fact that no one can deny, and the complaints of the salaried class about the inaccuracy of the cost of living index are already a common conclusion everywhere. But from the manufacturers' point of view, the index is still too high and cannot be afforded, and sometimes even the salaries cannot be paid, which leads to disputes between labor and capital. Therefore, we do not need to talk high-sounding words about what affects the national economy and the people's livelihood; just for the sake of stabilizing the lives of the people of Shanghai, this deformed economic phenomenon cannot be allowed to continue for a long time.

There are certainly many ways to save the current economic crisis; but the easiest way to achieve results seems to be the exchange of materials between the North and the South. Everyone knows that China's economy is a whole organic body and cannot be divided; now, due to the civil war, the North and the South are isolated and materials cannot be exchanged, just like the blood in the human body cannot circulate; both the North and the South feel the pain of partial exhaustion. In other words, the city's industry and commerce certainly need the North's fuel and raw materials; and the North also needs the city's finished products. If materials between the North and the South can be exchanged, both sides will benefit from it; otherwise, both sides will feel the pain of partial exhaustion, the lives of the people in the North will certainly not be improved, and the city's industry and commerce cannot move from depression to prosperity. From this, it can be seen even more that peace is important for the economy, and if the peace talks in Beiping are unfortunately unsuccessful, then all major plans related to the national economy and the people's livelihood will not be discussed. Relying solely on the exchange of materials between the North and the South will not immediately get the city's industry and commerce out of the predicament. How to develop the city's industry and commerce should still start from the root.

### Tao Xisheng Analyzes the Situation in Guangzhou: This Week Is Key for Peace Talks; If the CCP Crosses the Yangtze, China Will Face Atomic Bomb Warfare; President Chiang Supports Comprehensive Peace and Will Not Go to Guangzhou

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 11th] The Central Party Headquarters held a memorial week on the 11th. Chairman Li Zonghuang led the ceremony. Then, Vice Minister Tao Xisheng of the Central Propaganda Department analyzed the current situation. Tao first said: This week is the key to the peace talks. Whether an agreement can be reached on the principles of the peace talks will be a matter within this week. The current peace talks are of great importance. The survival of the nation, the lives of the people, and the safety of the world all depend on its success or failure. If the peace talks can achieve comprehensive and just peace, then China will not perish, the people can rest, the crisis of World War III in the Far East can be缓和ed, and China will not become a battlefield. If the CCP forces the government to surrender, or crosses the Yangtze militarily, then China's national survival, the people's free way of life, and the security of the Far East will all be threatened and destroyed. World War III will inevitably arrive earlier. After eight years of war against Japan and three years of turmoil, China will face the flames of an atomic bomb war, and its tragedy will be unprecedented in history. Tao continued, saying that the democratic countries' line of defense against aggression is being formed. The CCP has issued a declaration that it will help Soviet Russia fight in World War III. The CCP's attempt to create a battlefield in China promotes the early realization of the anti-communist united front of democratic countries in the Pacific and various ethnic groups in Asia. If the CCP breaks the peace talks, or advances to cross the Yangtze River to force the government to surrender, then China's 12 million square miles of territory and 400 million people, wherever they raise the flag of the Republic of China against aggression, will immediately receive the support of the democratic world. However, the party's policy today is to support Acting President Li and President He in striving for comprehensive and just peace and to hope for its success. As President Chiang said to foreign reporters at the end of October last year: "China has no intention of solving China's internal problems by taking advantage of the common disaster of the world." It must be known that if World War III occurs, China will inevitably be a major battlefield, and even if the China problem is solved in the world problem, the pain and sacrifice of the Chinese people will be unbearable. Based on this reason, President Chiang reiterated the peace policy in his New Year's Day message. The party still adheres to this policy today, and the government's sincere efforts to seek peace aim to prevent the CCP from guiding China to fight for Soviet Russia. Finally, Tao explained President Chiang's attitude, saying that General Chiang, in his position as an ordinary citizen, supports the government in striving for comprehensive peace and hopes for its success. The General will not come to Guangzhou. It is rumored that the party will convene the Fifth Plenary Session and the General will come to Guangzhou to preside over it, which is completely untrue. The General is the leader of the party, but the major plans for war and peace are all decided by Acting President Li and President He.

### Sun Fangzhi, Commander of the Xichang Jingbian, Submits Policy for Governing the Yi People

### Long Yun Has No Intention of Returning to Politics; Extremely Concerned About Banditry in Yunnan; Wan Baobang's Bandit Gang in Southern Yunnan Has Been Decimated

[Our Kunming Dispatch of the 11th] This reporter visited Provincial Committee Member Yang Wenqing, who had just returned from Hong Kong, again on the morning of the 11th, focusing especially on the movements of former Chairman Long Yun. According to reports, Long Yun has been away from Yunnan for four years and feels very estranged from everything in his hometown, but he is very concerned about banditry in Yunnan. President He had previously sent Long's eldest son to Hong Kong to ask him to come out of retirement, but Long declined due to illness. His interest in politics has almost completely disappeared, and the current situation is chaotic, so Long has no intention of re-entering the vortex. Yang finally said that he had separately visited Acting President Li, President He, and Chief of Staff Gu in Beijing, and they all expressed great concern for Yunnan's politics. However, they expressed absolute faith in Chairman Lu and decided to give Chairman Lu the greatest power to deal with the difficulties. As long as it is beneficial to the people of Yunnan Province, he can take decisive actions, and the central government will not interfere.

[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 11th] Former Yunnan Chairman Long Yun sent a letter to the Nanjing authorities this morning, refusing to serve as Yunnan Chairman again. In the letter, he insisted that Acting President Li should accept Mao Zedong's eight conditions proposed as the basis for peace talks. The Nationalist government had invited Long Yun to serve as Yunnan Chairman again.

[United Press, Hong Kong, 11th] Long Yun issued a statement today, advocating that Acting President Li accept Mao Zedong's eight peace conditions. According to reports, the power to put the country on the path of peace rests with Li, and surrender is not shameful. If the Nationalist government seeks to obtain a final base in Yunnan, I will unite the people to overthrow this reactionary force.

[Our Kunming Dispatch of the 11th] Since the Nationalist army recovered Pingbian in southern Yunnan, Wan Baobang, whose old nest was lost, led more than 300 of his trusted bandits to flee from Pingdong Lahadi to Bajiaozhai. The 26th Army continued to pursue and suppress them, killing Yang Weixin, the captain of the 6th Detachment of Wan's gang. Zhang Shucheng, the pseudo-camp chief, led his troops to surrender. The main force suffered a major setback. The Nationalist army took advantage of the victory to strengthen its pressure. The bandits fled into the mountains and finally captured He Chengwu, the pseudo-deputy commander-in-chief of Wan's gang, alive. Wan Baobang fled along a small road to the watershed. His army has been decimated, and the Nationalist army is still advancing.

### He, Yu, Gan Training Corps Rebels Return Gradually; Wuxing Residents Feel More Secure; A Student Publishes a Confession Describing Being Deceived

[Our Newspaper Wuxing Tenth] A portion of the Jiaxing Youth Reserve Cadre Training Corps, estimated at over eight hundred students, arrived within the borders of this county with weapons. The local security authorities dispatched teams to prevent their entry, creating a tense situation and causing widespread anxiety. Fortunately, the students did not come into contact with local militia along their route, and thus no battles occurred. In various townships, one hundred and two individuals have voluntarily surrendered their weapons and have been sent back to the original training corps in Jiaxing. The main force is currently near Sanchiao Wharf in Wukang, with indications of entering Tianmu Mountain. There are also scattered, errant students in townships such as Taixi, Meifeng, Changchao, and Nanxun. The First District Commissioner dispatched Deputy Commander Lang on the ninth to offer amnesty and a chance for self-renewal. The tense situation in the urban area is gradually easing, and entertainment venues have resumed normal operations. Public sentiment is also becoming more stable. According to one of the students, Yi Kaitai, who submitted a written confession in Nanxun and presented it to the town chief, Chen, the original text is as follows: "On the afternoon of April 6th, at 10 PM, a sense of tension suddenly arose. We were told that there would be a war preparedness military exercise that night. I quickly packed my luggage, and then we were issued weapons and ammunition, and we prepared all the necessary items to carry. Things that were inconvenient to carry were sent to nearby residents' homes. However, the gates were under strict guard, and we were unable to take things out. We had no choice but to leave them in the barracks and wait for departure. But rumors spread, such as 'We are ordered to go to Fujian or Jiangxi' and 'The war preparedness exercise will take about three days.' We were completely confused. As dawn approached, after finishing breakfast, there were also rumors that Teams 15 and 16 would not leave because the destination was unknown. However, a few students in our team advocated not leaving, but the majority believed that this was an order. We didn't know what we were doing, and if we didn't go, we feared we would be punished. The order was issued by the General Commander for a 'war preparedness exercise.' We students were unable to understand the General Commander's intentions and were unaware of his internal changes. We could only obey the order. The General Commander was appointed by the state, and obeying him meant obeying the state. Moreover, in a military training institution, a war preparedness exercise is a part of the curriculum. As soldiers, our duty is obedience, so we had no reason not to follow. Little did we know that he was deceiving and blinding us, this group of youths. His orders changed, and he launched a rebellious and ambitious action, turning passionate youths into his personal capital, to sacrifice for his ambitions. However, we have passion and even more reason. In our hearts, we only love the country and the people. We are determined to sacrifice for the masses of people, and we absolutely refuse to obey ambitious rebels who seek to seize power. Therefore, during the march, upon learning of the 'rebellion,' I immediately left the team and departed. Hearing that Jiaxing was not allowing us to enter the city, I decided to return home to my native place, to farm and support my parents, and to enjoy the joy of family reunion. Passing through your district, I was detained by comrades of your department, who said that I would be welcome to return to my original unit. Yi Kaitai drafted this."

### Under Pressure from Congress, the US Government Will Consider Changing its China Policy

[United Press Washington Tenth] Congressional opponents of the State Department's China policy told the United Press today that they believe there are now signs that the US government's views on China may be shifting. Democratic Senator McCarran said he believes congressional pressure will force the government to consider some changes. Republican Congressman Judd said he believes the recent debate on the Economic Cooperation Administration amendment and the response of the House Foreign Affairs Committee publicly abandoned the so-called Marshall policy.

McCarran said, "I believe that when the State Department understands the attitude of Congress, the department will change, and it should change quickly. Congress has recently tried to obtain a definition of policy from the State Department, which shows the attitude of Congress."

Judd's remarks are based on the reply of Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Kee. During the debate, Kee was questioned, "Do we mean that under this bill (extending the payment of the Economic Cooperation Administration's $54 million to 1950), we will not aid any government that is allied with the Communist Party, regardless of whether the Communist Party controls that government?" Kee answered in the affirmative. According to Judd, speaking to the United Press, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, although a Democrat, admitted that the policy of alliance with the Communist Party in China was a mistake. If it is a mistake now, then it must have been a mistake in the past.

Whether Congress will agree with Judd's assumption can only be determined by a vote, but both the House and Senate have voted by large majorities to extend the Economic Cooperation Administration's payment deadline to aid Nationalist China.

McCarran and Judd both said that there are signs that Congress disagrees with the State Department's wait-and-see policy. McCarran said that the best evidence is that 25 Democratic and Republican senators signed a letter to Secretary of State Acheson last month, urging new military and economic aid to the Nationalist government. Prior to that, 51 Republican congressmen sent a letter to Truman, asking him to respond to the China policy. Acheson has tried to respond to the bipartisan members of the Administrative Conference.

Asked to comment on the so-called Marshall policy, a State Department official said there was nothing new in Kee's reply. The official reiterated Truman's press conference on March 11, 1948, during which someone asked whether Marshall's delegation and the expansion of the Nationalist government's base meant accommodating the Communist Party. Truman replied that he did not believe Marshall intended to bring any communists into the Chinese government and further stated, "If we can help it, we do not want a communist government in China or anywhere else."

The attitude of many officials in the State Department is that Marshall tried to help the Chinese resolve their disputes, but this attempt ended when Marshall left China, and it has since been a matter solely for the Chinese. However, members of Congress such as McCarran and Judd hold different views, saying that the State Department ignored Congress's warnings and insisted on a coalition government between the Nationalists and Communists.

### Establishment of a German Autonomous Government; The Three-Power Plan Encounters Obstacles; The German Social Democratic Party Stresses a Centralized System

[Reported News] New York Eleventh Radio Broadcast: Bonn News, The plan of the Western German occupation authorities to rebuild the German autonomous government seems to have been hampered today due to the attitude of the German Social Democratic Party. After holding an emergency meeting, the Social Democratic Party decided to reject the occupation authorities' plan to establish a loose federal government. The party insists on establishing a strong centralized government. This requirement of the party has been repeatedly rejected by the occupation authorities, but the party is still determined not to yield. The occupation authorities were quite surprised by this reaffirmation of their position, because the political advisors of the three-nation occupation forces of the United States, Britain and France had previously expected that the party would eventually yield. A spokesman for the Social Democratic Party, Hain, said that the party has made concessions to the point where there is no more room for concessions. From now on, it will be up to the Christian Democratic Party to take compromise steps.

[United Press Bonn Tenth] The liaison officers of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and France, delivered the new German occupation regulations to Anterno, the Speaker of the West German Constituent Assembly today, but no ceremony was held. After German political leaders discussed it at An's residence for half an hour, none of them showed joy and decided not to express their opinions for 48 hours. Vice Speaker Sopherte was flushed, while Social Democratic leader Schmidt and Christian Democratic leader Casep were serious. An has summoned the Occupation Regulations Committee to meet on the 11th to review the matter. On the 12th, the committee will hold talks with the prime ministers of the eleven states in West Germany, and then on the 13th, the Constituent Assembly will issue a communiqué. The Constituent Assembly can send representatives to visit the military governors of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and France, on the 14th to report everything.

[United Press Bonn Eleventh] German political leaders expressed indifference to the new occupation regulations in West Germany. Although the regulations give Germans the highest degree of autonomy within the scope of military security, they are full of restrictions and reservations. The "Social Democratic" newspaper criticized the Allies for continuing to control German industrial and commercial research for fear of German competition. The newspaper commented that this move is really intolerable. Only by allowing Germans to participate in technical development industries can the German economy participate in the competition in the world market. In addition, the Allied control of Germany's foreign relations will make it impossible for Germany to recover in Europe or obtain an equal position in the United Nations.

[Agence France-Presse Washington Eleventh] Radio commentator Pearson announced last night that after the implementation of the new German occupation regulations, the director of the International Bank, McLoy, will succeed Clay as the US High Commissioner to West Germany.

However, Dulles pointed out that the relations between East and West were not as tense as they are now, Europe had not yet been separated by the Iron Curtain, and the reliance of the Western European economy on sources outside Europe was not as obvious and urgent as it is now.

### Guerrillas Launch New Offensive; Greece Calls on Allied Forces to Intervene; Conspiracy to Assassinate Prominent Greek Figures is Cracked

[Agence France-Presse Athens Tenth] Officials announced today that Greek guerrillas have launched a new offensive in the Grammos Mountain area. The Greek Army General Headquarters issued a communiqué stating that rebel forces attacked villages such as Chlofti and Okios, but were repelled.

[Agence France-Presse Athens Tenth] Athens Radio called on the Allied forces in Greece to intervene today. When mentioning the "invasion of the Grammos Mountain area prepared in Albanian territory" in the broadcast, it said that if the Allies want to maintain peace, they must take action quickly. Nine years after the totalitarian country invaded Greek territory, Greece is still continuing to fight for its territorial integrity and political independence. However, the Greek army, which only receives material assistance, is today abiding by international treaties in its struggle, and the restrictions stipulated in these treaties prevent it from pursuing invaders to their bases as it did when Italy invaded in 1940. Therefore, the hopes of free people should not be disappointed. The Allied forces should take action on the battlefield, just as they took action in Africa after winning in Albania in 1940.

[Reuters Athens Eleventh] The Greek Ministry of Public Security announced that it has captured 80 communists who attempted to assassinate prominent figures.

### Nehru to Present New Plan for Anglo-Indian Relations to the Commonwealth Conference; India to Maintain Ties with Britain After Independence

[Associated Press, New Delhi, 10th] It has been learned from reliable sources on the 10th that Indian Prime Minister Nehru will attend the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in London on April 21st to propose suggestions regarding the future relationship between India and the British Commonwealth. According to reliable sources, Nehru raised the following two suggestions in the Indian National Congress Working Committee: (1) Recognition of Indian nationality, with each Indian citizen holding dual citizenship, being citizens of both the Republic of India and the United Kingdom; (2) A plan for India to continue to maintain ties with the British Commonwealth after independence. It is said that India is preparing to formulate a certain formula under which the British monarch will retain the title of First Citizen of the Commonwealth, but in other matters, his status will be equal to that of the President of the Republic of India. Therefore, the appointment of Indian diplomatic personnel will be by the Indian President rather than the British monarch. British citizens in India should pledge allegiance to the Indian President (as the representative of the British monarch), while Indian citizens in Britain should pledge allegiance to the British monarch.

### India Does Not Plan to Participate in War If It Breaks Out

Nehru's Remarks to Reporters

[Associated Press, London, 10th] Indian Prime Minister Nehru told reporters from the Daily Mail in New Delhi today that if war breaks out, India may not participate. Nehru admitted, "If war breaks out in any location, it is likely to affect the entire globe. India may need to participate for the sake of its own interests, but it will depend on the circumstances. A friendly India, with good relations with other republics, will be more valuable to other republics than the limited military assistance India can provide. India, like other republics, can avoid participating in or becoming involved in any war involving the United Kingdom. Europe has always been the center, while Asia is only on the periphery of the world's center of gravity, but Asia has not yet become the location of major peasant movements, as can be seen in the turbulent situation in many Asian countries." Nehru also said that a republican India can easily fit into the Commonwealth of Republics, as only the format needs to be changed.

### Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu Visits Nehru

Thakin Nu said that the Karen rebellion, which was at its peak last month, is now on the verge of collapse, and he believes that all parties will do their best to participate in the election when general elections are held in July. When a reporter asked how long the rebellion in Burma would last, Thakin Nu replied: It can be resolved in the short term. He also said that if India and Britain could provide Burma with a large amount of military equipment, the rebellion in Burma could be quelled quickly.

### Truman to Urge Congress to Expedite Ratification of Atlantic Pact; Connally Argues Military Aid Costs Should Be Reduced as Much as Possible

[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally said on the 11th that the cost of rearming Europe must be "reduced as much as possible." Truman may ask the Senate on the evening of the 11th to expedite the ratification of the Atlantic Pact, an action that will inevitably trigger new demands for full intelligence regarding the US military aid plan to Western Europe.

Connally said: "The military aid plan must be coordinated with the Marshall Plan, the defense plan, and other resources. This is a large whole and must be handled properly so that we do not allow any plan to conflict with or hinder other plans." Connally said: "Full and open" hearings on the Atlantic Pact will take about a month. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will begin hearings on the treaty on the 18th, and there is generally no doubt that the two-thirds vote required for the Senate to pass the treaty will be obtained.

### Why is the United States Losing Ground in Asia?

— Translated Manuscript from the Editorial Department of this Newspaper

The United States is gradually losing ground in Asia. From North China to the Java Sea, anti-American sentiment is surging and spreading to other places. The biggest reason is that the United States is assisting Japan before other countries. Improper policies towards China and the activities of Asian communists are also major reasons for weakening American influence. The goodwill and friendliness that Asians had for Uncle Sam have disappeared. Replacing it is suspicion and resentment.

Americans are gradually losing face in the East. The goodwill and beneficence that the United States accumulated during World War II is about to run dry. In the vast region inhabited by one billion people, the near-hero worship that they expressed for the United States a few years ago is now gradually turning into deep-seated resentment.

A reporter for "U.S. News & World Report" recently traveled through the Far East for eight months, from Japan and China, across the South Pacific, through India and Arab countries to the Mediterranean. The general impression he gained from this region is: Asians are waking up from their dream of America—painfully and thoroughly.

Thoughtful people in Asia are worried that American policy aims to rebuild Japan. They are indignant at American policy towards China and suspicious of American motives in striving for national independence in Indonesia, Vietnam, and other regions. People generally feel that American policy—or the lack of a comprehensive and holistic Asian policy—not only alienates a billion friends and powerful allies but also causes millions of bewildered people to lean towards the Communist Party.

Asian Nations' Hostility Towards the US

Asian nations' distrust of the United States is deepening. A reporter who traveled thousands of miles was repeatedly asked: "Why does the United States betray Asian nations?" The first person to ask this question was a Japanese economist who emerged from seclusion to assist in the occupation mission but, after being confused by American policies and actions, retired again after a year. A Korean labor leader also raised the same question shortly before his assassination.

A Chinese philosopher (who blamed the chaos in his country on the United States), a Filipino journalist, a local engineer working underground in French Vietnam, an Indonesian student, a Burmese political scientist, and an Indian professor raised this difficult question using similar words.

During the period of Japan's defeat, these many people were all ardent admirers of the United States. This reverence has now almost disappeared. In the vast region of the East, plagued by famine, low living standards, and political unrest, friendliness towards the United States is gradually cooling down. After careful examination of all levels and hundreds of interviews, the crux of the Far East problem was pointed out.

In the past year or two, due to the trend of American policy towards Japan, people in various parts of Asia have deepened their hostility towards the United States. Chinese of all parties are deeply afraid that the United States will restore Japan's combat power. The reporter heard a prime minister, a businessman, a labor leader, a journalist, and a banker express this fear in succession within a week. They unanimously felt that establishing a strong Japan in the chaotic East has the tendency to preserve the strength of the militarists who launched the war in the past.

Not only are the Chinese like this, but the Filipinos are even more resentful of American policy in Japan. The Filipinos feel that the defeated country has now transformed into the victor, while the victor is being treated as the defeated country.

Most Asians attach great importance to American concerns about the Soviet Union. What they suspect is that the United States wants to turn Japan into a bulwark against the Soviet Union, but it has neglected the democratization of the former enemy. They believe that even if Japan can become strong, it is unlikely to become democratic.

As a result, in places like the Philippines, people's goodwill towards the United States is gradually showing signs of decline. As Filipinos feel that the United States is more concerned about Japan's recovery than the Philippines' recovery, the infinite enthusiasm for the United States when it granted the Philippines independence is gradually waning.

Procrastination in Policy Towards China

Like in other parts of the East, the Chinese respect for the United States is gradually declining. The United States is in an unpleasant situation. The Communist Party has always rejected American policy towards China, and the non-Communist opposition to President Chiang accuses the United States of maintaining Chiang's power with more than two billion US dollars in aid since World War II. Now even Chiang's most powerful supporters are gradually becoming hostile to the United States, accusing American aid of being too little and too late to prevent the expansion of Communist power.

The "U.S. News & World Report" reporter interviewed a Chinese professor who seemed to express an attitude that represents the majority opinion. He, a Kuomintang member and a follower of Sun Yat-sen, had already joined the anti-Chiang front before the CCP launched its winter offensive and won successive victories. He told the reporter: "You Americans should be held responsible for prolonging the Chinese civil war. If it weren't for your intervention, we would have ended this bloody tragedy long ago, which is what we all sincerely prayed for. If you continue to support Chiang, the United States will lose all of its Chinese friends, and the CCP will inevitably conquer all of China." (To be continued)

### Grain Purchase and Storage Meeting Decides to Purchase Rice in Large Quantities Domestically and Abroad; Hope for Continued US Aid Rice from July

[Report from this newspaper] City Government Secretary-General Chen Liang attended the grain purchase and storage meeting held by the Shanghai Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration this afternoon at 3 p.m. According to Secretary-General Chen, when he met with reporters after the meeting, the resolutions of the meeting were as follows: (1) A decision was made to negotiate the purchase of 62,000 tons of rice from abroad. (2) A decision was made to procure 600,000 dan of rice domestically, which will be procured by the competent authorities or entrusted to grain merchants. (3) There is hope for continued US aid relief rice for this city from July. The Deputy Director of the Shanghai Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration told Dr. Yen Hui-ching, who attended the meeting, in a very pleasant tone that the U.S. is willing to do its best to assist with the city's rice distribution problem.

Secretary-General Chen also told reporters that regarding the rice price issue, the government's current policy is not absolute control but rather a moderate, flexible, and non-dangerous regulation. It is not that the city government cannot forcefully suppress rice prices, but it is concerned that if high pressure is applied, there may be a problem with the availability of rice. Relevant agencies such as the National Bank, the Ministry of Finance, and the Shanghai Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration have decided to establish close contact to provide appropriate regulation of rice prices. According to Secretary-General Chen's analysis, the factor driving up rice prices is the mutual influence of the gold and silver speculation. In the past, rice prices had fixed ratios, generally believed to be equal to the price of five US dollars and ten silver yuan. Now that the prices of US dollars and silver yuan are constantly rising, it will naturally stimulate the rise in rice prices. He also said that Police Chief Mao Sen, due to the recent sharp rise in rice prices, called Secretary-General Chen around 12:00 a.m. the day before yesterday to inquire whether rice merchants should be punished. Secretary-General Chen told him that if rice merchants have not intentionally exceeded the price limit, the arrest should be postponed.

Secretary-General Chen's opinion on suppressing rice prices is that the government can imitate the current socialistic approach of the British Labour Party by implementing full rationing for rice. Currently, the rationing of household rice has solved two-thirds of the city's needs, with the remaining one-third coming from the free market. If the government can find a way to implement full rationing, it can curb the violent rise in rice prices.

### The Grain Storage Committee Has Completed One-Third of the Urban Food Rationing Plan for May and June

[Report from this newspaper] The Grain Storage Committee is actively planning for the urban food rationing for May and June and has completed one-third of the plan. The food rationing for the four cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Qingdao will continue in May and June, requiring a total of 129,000 metric tons of rice and 16,000 metric tons of flour, which will be sourced equally from the US and China. So far, China has prepared 28,000 metric tons of rice and 2,600 metric tons of flour, and the Grain Purchase Committee is actively working to obtain the remaining amount. The US and China have preliminarily agreed on the following urban food supply plan for May and June: (1) Nanjing: Requires 42,000 metric tons of rice per month, which will be fully supplied by China in May and June. (2) Shanghai: Requires 42,000 metric tons of rice per month, with China supplying 19,750 metric tons per month and the US supplying the remainder. (3) Guangzhou: Requires 13,500 metric tons of rice per month, with China supplying 3,375 metric tons per month and the US supplying the remainder. (4) Qingdao: Requires 8,000 metric tons of flour per month, which will be fully supplied by the US in May and fully supplied by China in June.

[Another Report] 8,500 tons of US aid rice arrived here on the 9th from Siam for distribution in Shanghai. Another batch of 9,100 tons of rice is scheduled to be delivered on April 18th. In addition, 96,000 tons of rice will be shipped to China between now and June 30th. The Economic Cooperation Administration rice currently en route to China or already approved for purchase, as well as the rice that the Chinese government has designated for purchase, is sufficient to ensure the continuation of rationing until the end of June. The rice to be unloaded in China includes 30,000 tons of American rice, with the remainder to be purchased in Southeast Asia. The Economic Cooperation Administration rice shipped to China will be used to support the rationing programs in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shantou. The Chinese government is currently handling the rationing in Nanjing entirely on its own, as Nanjing is closer to domestic rice-producing areas. The rationing in Qingdao is being handled with American flour from the Economic Cooperation Administration.

### Economic Conference to Be Held Today to Discuss Suppressing Commodity Prices

[Report from this newspaper] The city government has scheduled an economic conference for 3:00 p.m. today, convening relevant agencies to discuss suppressing commodity prices and study the current overall economic situation. Secretary-General Chen met with Liu Gongyun, Lin Chongyong, Li Lixia, and others in Caojia Garden yesterday to secretly discuss suppressing the current rise in commodity prices. According to Secretary-General Chen, he will propose at today's conference that the central government arrest silver dollar dealers to avoid stimulating price increases. Future silver dollar trading can be done by the National Bank listing prices and entrusting legal stores to handle it.

### The Social Affairs Bureau Strives to Simplify Commercial Registration Procedures

The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has recently been striving to simplify commercial registration procedures to provide as much convenience as possible to citizens. In the past, it was stipulated that industrial and commercial firms that were approved to sell rationed materials should, when applying for registration, submit a guarantee certificate issued by two registered firms in the same industry in accordance with the rules for preventing speculation by merchants and residents. Now, this method is no longer applicable and only increases the trouble for merchants and residents. It has been submitted to this municipal government meeting for approval to abolish it, effective April 11. It has also been stipulated that the period from application to issuance of the certificate will be at most two weeks. If a registration has been applied for to the bureau and no notification of certificate receipt has been received after two weeks, the receipt number can be directly noted in a written inquiry to the bureau's First Division or the Industrial and Commercial Registration Office.

### Industrial Raw Material Issues: Continued Symposium, Enamel and Other Industries Express Difficulties, All Hoping to Promote Material Exchange

[Report from our newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau continued to convene a symposium yesterday on the supply and demand of various industrial raw materials in the city. The results of the meeting are recorded as follows:

Enamel Industry: The main raw materials are black iron sheets and six other items. The quota for the fifth and sixth quarters is US$160,000, which is only about 20% of the required amount. The market inventory of this raw material is also not abundant, and the current inventory is only enough for one month. The difficulties faced by the industry are: (1) Imported raw materials cannot be shipped due to the suspension of export licenses. (2) Sales in North China have stagnated, and the selling price of finished products is lower than the cost, and factories will be forced to reduce or suspend work. (3) The monthly demand for fuel diesel is 700 tons, but currently only 40% is allocated, which is extremely difficult. The industry hopes: (1) that the government will relax the foreign exchange quota for black iron sheets to increase imports and maintain production. (2) Please ask the Social Affairs Bureau to transfer the matter to the relevant authorities to expedite negotiations with the US Commercial Consul in Shanghai to issue export permits for black iron sheets ordered from the United States by various enamel factories. (3) The diesel allocation is insufficient, please forward a letter to the Diesel Allocation Committee to increase the allocation.

Leather Manufacturing Industry: The main raw materials are (1) raw cowhide (demand of 1 million pounds), (2) raw sheepskin (demand of 180,000 pounds), (3) chemical raw materials (such as tanning agents). The supply of hides is scarce and the price is high, currently only enough for twelve days of use. Tanning agents can be used for two weeks. The government is requested to provide loans to store and purchase raw materials and to facilitate sources from North China.

Seasoning Powder Industry: The raw materials are carbon powder and caustic soda. To store six months of raw materials, 30,000 pounds of carbon powder and 170,000 pounds of caustic soda are needed. The difficulties faced by the industry are: (1) The monthly fuel requirement is 800 tons, and the coal inventory is insufficient. (2) Gold is insufficient for turnover. The industry requests: (1) that the scope of industrial loans be broadened to include the seasoning powder industry. (2) Increase coal allocation. (3) Realize the exchange of materials between North and South.

### Sun Ke-qiang and Others' Embezzlement Case: Individual Interrogations Last Five Hours; Zhang Zheng-wu Glared and Scolded, Stating the Extortion Situation in Court

[Report from our newspaper] Sun Ke-qiang, the former head of the Zhabei Police Station, was accused of corruption and dereliction of duty. He was sent to the District Court for detention along with the other three defendants: Zhang Liang-zhu, a police officer from the Tianshengqiao Police Station; Zhang Zheng-wu, a police officer from the Xincheng Police Sub-bureau; and Jin Yi-qing, a police officer from the Gonghe Road Police Station. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, Judge Ou Sheng-he held the first trial. After five hours of individual interrogations, the court adjourned at 2:00 PM and ordered further investigations before another trial. The defendants were returned to custody.

The charges against the first defendant, Sun Ke-qiang, are: (1) embezzling donations from the Winter Defense Mutual Aid Association in the district; (2) extorting citizens for illegal construction; and (3) protecting his subordinates to extort Ren Zhi-yan, a monk from the Taiyang Temple. Ren Zhi-yan was also summoned to testify about the incident yesterday. The court, considering the seriousness of the case, adopted individual interrogations, prohibited family members of the defendants and bystanders from entering and leaving at will, and declined reporters' requests to take photos. The atmosphere in the courtroom was very serious.

The Taiyang Temple Monk Testified in Detail

The first to testify was the temple monk Ren Zhi-yan, who stated: He has been a monk for 26 years. Fourteen years ago, following his elder brother's wishes, he lived with Xie Xing-gu. They initially lived on Wenzhou Road in the city, moved to Ningbo during the war, and returned to Shanghai after the war, living on Xinmin Road. Both places have registered residences, with Xie as the head of the household. On the 11th of last month, late at night, while he and Xie were staying on Datong Road, two policemen suddenly broke into the door, holding flashlights, and in a menacing manner, accused him of being reported for colluding with bandits and obstructing public morals, and were ordered by the director of the sub-bureau to investigate. If he was willing to pay two gold bars, the case could be closed. Then they ransacked the room and conducted a major search. He handed over all of his 4,000 yuan in cash and two gold rings. He was still tied up and taken to the Datong Road Police Station. At 10:00 AM on the 12th, he was escorted to the Zhabei Sub-bureau's judicial section for interrogation and was released on bail in the evening. After the testimony, the court ordered the four defendants to be brought to the court, and Ren identified Zhang Zheng-wu as the one who took the stolen goods. Zhang Liang-zhu and Jin Yi-qing were waiting outside the door. Another person in a black coat was the guide, Zhang Zhi-fang, who is related to Zhang Zheng-wu.

The Court Was Furious at the Situation

Zhang Liang-zhu then testified: On the evening of March 11, Director Sun of the sub-bureau telephoned the patrol officer Wang Jie of the police station to handle the case. Wang was not in the station, so he was ordered to go to Sun's house, hand over the confidential report, and ask him to investigate. He then went with Jin Yi-qing, a police officer from the Gonghe Road Police Station, and Zhang Zhi-fang, the guide, introduced Zhang Zheng-wu, a police officer from the Xincheng Sub-bureau, to assist. After arriving at Ren's house, he and Jin waited outside the door. Zhi-fang and Zheng-wu went upstairs. He also went upstairs to inquire. The monk and Xie Xing-gu initially claimed to be uncle and niece, but later changed their story to husband and wife, and they had no identification. Suspecting their intentions, they wanted to take them to the bureau. The monk then offered 4,000 yuan and two gold rings to bribe them, which he refused. He brought the stolen goods to the bureau as evidence. Zhang Zheng-wu testified: Although he was not ordered by his superiors to investigate the case, he agreed to assist because the monk was suspected of colluding with bandits. The court then ordered him and Ren Zhi-yan to stand face to face and demonstrate the extortion situation that night. Zhang glared at Ren with a threatening attitude and scolded Ren, "Don't fart." The court was furious at the situation.

Vehemently Denying All Accusations

After interrogating Jin Yi-qing, Sun Ke-qiang was brought to testify. He stated that the confidential report he received was provided by Huang De-sheng, who claimed that Ren Zhi-yan was colluding with bandits and plotting against him, and that he had committed adultery with his wife. He also claimed that Ren had contacted Officer Guo of the Gonghe Road Police Station in the district, so he ordered the Tianshengqiao Police Station to send officers to investigate. He vehemently denied the accusations of protecting his subordinates to extort money and preventing the criminals from being sent to the General Bureau after the incident. Regarding the discrepancies between his testimony and the investigation report made by the judicial section of the bureau, he argued that it was due to the different testimonies on which they were based.

Regarding the organization of the Winter Defense Mutual Aid Association in the district and the collection and expenditure of donations from merchants, Sun stated: The Winter Defense Mutual Aid Association was proposed by local people in December last year. Although the General Bureau did not explicitly approve the fundraising, it was reported at the meeting. A total of more than 40,000 yuan was raised, of which more than 10,000 yuan was collected by the volunteer police, and the remaining funds were kept by Xu Yang, the patrol officer of the district. The expenditures were handled by him. Two expenses were recorded in the account, one for 7,200 yuan and one for 11,700 yuan. He has forgotten whether they were spent by him. Among the funds raised, he purchased two barrels of gasoline, one barrel was handed over to the bureau, and the other is still in custody.

Further Investigation Required, Trial to be Rescheduled

The court asked why the public property was stored in a private home? And why it had not been handed over after the incident in March of this year? Sun claimed that because the bureau was far from Zhabei, he bought the oil in the city and stored it near his home. Because someone said that the price of the oil was too high, he ordered the person in charge to submit the receipts, so he delayed sending it to the bureau. As for the accusations of extorting bribes from citizens for illegal construction, he completely denied them, claiming that there were too many refugees in the district, and they were building sheds at any time, which was difficult to control. Finally, Ji Xiu-cheng, the head of the general affairs section of the district, Xu Yang, the patrol officer, and Xu Zhao-zhen, the section chief of the Taifeng Yarn Factory, were summoned. They all said that the donations raised by the Winter Defense Mutual Aid Association were handed over to Sun for responsible allocation, but they did not know how they were allocated. At this point, the court ordered further investigation and rescheduled the trial. The court adjourned at 2:00 PM.

### Performing Arts Personnel Raise Welfare Funds

The Shanghai Performing Arts Association has recently learned that most of the practitioners in the performing arts industry only earn 30,000 to 50,000 yuan per month, and there is no index-based salary calculation method.

Because he did not comply with the police bureau's designated location, he was stopped by police officer Lin Shi-jin of the Putuo Sub-bureau.

### Ye Yun-kun Accused of Embezzling Allocated Yellow Board Paper

[Report from our newspaper] Ye Yun-kun, a graduate of the Department of Chemical Engineering of Datong University, partnered with Sun Guan-min, the father of his classmate, and others in March last year to open the Guohua Baoye Factory, specializing in the manufacture of building materials such as asphalt paper and asphalt felt. At that time, the shareholders' meeting elected Sun as the general manager, Ye as the manager, and another shareholder, Huang Xiang, as the factory director. Subsequently, Sun and Huang filed a private prosecution with the District Court, accusing Ye of embezzlement. According to the complaint: In June last year, it was learned that the Taiwan Paper Industry Corporation, based on the government's original intention of supporting industry and commerce, would allocate raw materials required by various manufacturers at low prices, and the allocation price was only about 20-30% of the market price. They immediately prepared a document to apply for the allocation of 20 tons of yellow board paper. Afterwards, there was no reply for a long time. At first, it was thought that Taiwan Paper Industry Corporation did not approve it, but at the beginning of this year, it was discovered that other manufacturers had been allocated one after another. After inquiring with Taiwan Paper Industry Corporation, they learned that the above-mentioned yellow board paper had already been used by Ye to impersonate the name of the Guohua Factory, privately carving a rubber stamp, and purchasing all of it under the name of the manager as early as July 19, 1937, and using it privately. At that time, the market price had reached more than 58 million legal tender per ton, and they requested the court to order the return of 20 tons of yellow board paper. The court, considering that both parties were friends, ordered a trial reconciliation and rescheduled the trial.

### Grassland Recruitment! (Part 2)

— Xiao Sai

"On the 9th, the Kanggan natives presented cattle as a welcome gift. We went to comfort them, but instead, they comforted us. Although we had a feast, our consciences were uneasy. On the 10th, a living Buddha requested that we send a doctor to treat his fellow Buddhist. I went with him to Amo Kase. The living Buddha had a three-point beard, resembling a villain in a stage play. He suffered from arthritis and needed a cane to walk. A silver medal was later awarded."

"On the 11th, we set up camp in the Sheye Ke Basin. It hailed and snowed. Legend has it that a goddess named Ren Zhi hid in the mountains. She encountered a strong man from the Yak Valley who was trading. After they had illicit relations, he lied and said he would welcome her after returning home. After being deceived, the goddess vowed that whenever a man from the Yak Valley passed by, she would send snowballs to kill him. Among our group, there were two men from the Yak Valley, so it felt like we were accompanying them to their execution ground."

"On the 12th, we passed Fang Gou Nawo Mountain, and on the 13th, we arrived at A Zhong Meng. The population gradually thinned. On the 14th, we crossed the Kaxi River on wooden rafts. Old subjects of Kang Kemin presented sheep and fish. In the evening, everyone ate their fill. The taste of the fish was heavenly. On the 15th, we passed the Daqing Yan'e (meaning 'Great Horse Tail Plain') horse-producing area. The Great Horse Valley and Little Horse Valley had healthy horse herds. The village here had over 400 households, all under the jurisdiction of the Aqugele Temple. Commander Ma conveyed the government's concern for the 52 tribes on the grassland."

Crossing the Reke River

"On the 17th, we crossed the Shuke River. Near the water, I remembered this local mountain song: 'Water, it's scary to avoid it, but you can go around it. Rain in the sky, there's no way to dodge it. Your own officers, you're afraid of them, but you can also avoid them. A match made in heaven, there's no way to dodge it.' On the 7th, we passed the Huowen Yu Li Gong Mountain, Ruo Mo Cliff, Gan Duo Dove, and on the 17th, we arrived at Gongma Sang. Zhan Jinshui was welcomed. They sat on the ground and ate raisins, sesame cakes, rock candy, and spicy buns. He met Kang Kemin's 19-year-old mistress, Zhebi. He wrote: 'We talked about these private matters behind closed doors to prevent his people from eavesdropping.' But he also wrote: 'Getting back to business, all the handles the government had on the Kang official were destroyed in Ma Bufang's military disaster.' He also recorded the traces left by Ma Bufang's looting of cattle and horses. In addition, some people's folk customs, visits to temples, acceptance of cattle and sheep, local life sketches, and trivial photography of Yi minorities are all insignificant. Before his death, Jinshui had continuously published his 'Grassland Journey' in Rongxin's 'New News.'"

Hope for Boundary Demarcation

During their ground banquet in Gongma Sang, they sang songs, and Zhebo sang: "A bottle of wine, not offered to a single Bodhisattva. A bag of bullets, not fired at a single enemy. A belly full of secrets, only one person knows." The Kang official sang: "The earth's clothes are the sun, the people's food is crops. Everyone fears him, everyone respects him, that is President Chiang!" From his songs, he was filled with hatred for Ma Bufang and the fervent request for the government to demarcate the boundaries. Even Jinshui couldn't help but sing, "The sun in the sky is like a sutra wheel, the flowers on the ground are embroidered brocade," and so on.

When they reached the White Clothes Temple in Shangda'er Tang, monks led by Huang Luan welcomed them. The living Buddha in the temple was polite to them, saying that he was very grateful for the government's concern and very appreciative of everyone's arduous journey, but he apologized for the poor hospitality in the remote border area. He also said: "It is an undeniable fact that Siguo Lu belongs to Sichuan. We hope the government will demarcate the boundary as soon as possible to eliminate the wolf's heart and see the light again."

Jinshui wrote: "My wife telegraphed to ask when I could return. There is still a long way to go, and it will be after the Double Ninth Festival. I wanted to reply by telegraph, but the radio station had already been destroyed."

On July 24th, they left Gongma Sang, and Commander Ma stayed behind. Zhebo accompanied them, singing loudly and racing horses. They crossed the Erhekou, turned northwest, and went up along the Ma'er River, passing the Hongzhuzi Mountain and Zhengzhong Niuma Mountain. On the 26th, they crossed the Yellow River. He recorded the Fang wine incident. Later, Mrs. Zhan (Zhan Wu Qiushui) received his last letter, which he wrote when crossing the river. The next day, the generator's light bulb broke, and from then on, they could no longer send urgent telegrams to Chengdu.

He remembered the local education with great interest: "Student Chen Ying, 17 years old, was not bad-looking. One night, she was summoned by the local official." And they received some Tibetan petitions.

Leaving No Dog or Sheep

Legend has it that Qinghai had sent twenty or thirty people with radio stations and boundary markers. Jinshui's diary on August 4th said: "They are probably here to demarcate the boundary. Although rumors on the road are not credible, they have confused us. According to Mr. Guo, Tongde County in Qinghai is only three horse-station stops away from Gongma Sang. Commissioner Han there is said to be coming to negotiate with us about Hongmo Sang." In this difficult and busy situation, Jinshui wrote a poem thinking of "Traveling ten thousand miles, always a guest, I don't know when I will return to my hometown?" He said: "This is a true portrayal of our group of people bound to the Western Fan."

"On the 87th, we passed Yu Qusang to watch the masked dance. On the night of the 8th, Ma Shegui said that in the 27th year, Ma Bufang sent Captain Lan to be stationed at the White Temple to collect straw head tax. The Fan people were unwilling and captured Lan alive, driving him like a horse, whipping him at every step, forcing him to the Yellow River. Lan's suffering in seeking death is hard to describe. The following year, Ma sent two cavalry battalions into E Luo, killing every dog and sheep."

Salt Lake Dissection

August 9th diary was his last diary, and there was no written record after that. On that day: "It rained, and the sound of raindrops on the tent was incessant, urging the cattle and horses, which was extremely annoying. I got up at half past ten, and after fifteen li, I reached the top of Tangke Li Peng Mountain, 4,830 meters high. Looking back at the Dangji Pu Duo Plain, it was truly vast. The land below the mountain is the boundary of Hongmi Sang, and beyond that, there is no human habitation. The grass is long, but there are no cattle or horses. It is truly a pity for such a great plain. After arriving at the ××× Valley (original blank), in the distance, I saw white and black dots..."

In addition, there was the "Siguo Lu Incident."

Because when the Kang Kemin local official returned to his place, he knew that more than one hundred families of his people had moved away. In the grasslands, the power of the local officials is determined by the number of people, the more people, the higher the income, the stronger the military force. Why did more than one hundred families move away? It was not a simple question. Thinking that Commander Ma was an important member of the provincial government, with power and status, he asked him to bring back the one hundred plus families who had moved to Qinghai Province. Commander Ma wanted to establish his reputation in the grasslands and agreed to his request. He sent four of his eloquent and strong members (including Secretary Zhan Jinshui, who said in a letter to his wife that Commander Ma persuaded him to go for the sake of the country), two translators, and several junior officers to escort them. At the same time, he telegraphed the provincial government to ask if they could go. After six or seven days of hardship, the dispatched members finally reached the Xinchuan Administration Bureau under the jurisdiction of Qinghai, but the negotiations were unsuccessful. It was said that there was still no Han official there, and they hoped that they would walk another day to the Salt Lake. In order to obey orders and hope for a result, they went to the Salt Lake despite the hardship. Who knew that after they went, they were all detained. At this moment, the commander was still enjoying himself in Gongma Sang, enjoying the local official's delicacies and fine wines, and cordial hospitality. After learning that the members had been detained, he reported to the provincial government. In mid-August, two escorting Fan soldiers ran back to report to the commander that they had personally seen the escorting junior official being shot dead. They told the detained people, "You can go home tonight, and your guns and horses will be returned to you. Please write a receipt first!" At night, the local Xifan, who were related to the escaped Xifan, told them: "Escape quickly, otherwise there will be an unfortunate incident tonight." So the two Xifan bought two horses and fled immediately. Later, it was heard that the Xifan who had escaped were all shot, and the Han people were dissected and sunk in the Salt Lake!

And Ma Bufang's reply was: "The propaganda group was accused of harboring criminals, Lalao, and attempted to disrupt Tongde. For the sake of self-defense, the province refused them entry. The Sichuan propaganda group should be in Sichuan Province. Moreover, propaganda and boundary demarcation cannot be handled by one province alone. Furthermore, the boundary of this province (Qinghai) has already been clearly demarcated, so there is no need for such a long journey. Moreover, Guoluo is more than twenty stations away from Songpan and more than ten stations away from Tongde. It is even more incomprehensible to march such a long distance and work so hard. As for the incident of the comfort personnel being killed, we are not aware of it. It is best to find a way to telegraph the Sichuan troops to return to avoid escalating the situation and to stabilize the border. This telegram has been kept for reference in resolving the Siguo Lu incident."

Commander Ma waited in Gongma Sang for a month without any news, so he had to go back. The newspaper said that he: "Commander Ma lived in Songpan, but his purpose was different. In Songpan, people heard that the comfort group was treating illnesses in the grasslands. Penicillin cost fifty 'Yuan Shikai' coins per shot, and 914 cost twenty 'Yuan Shikai' coins per shot per injection. For this trip, Commander Ma had nothing to gain except for fox skins, cattle, horses, and silver dollars. Because the local officials in the grasslands showed respect for the government officials, heavy gifts were the only expression, only the yaks suffered, as they were weighed down by fox skins and Yuan Shikai! The fat cattle and strong horses gifted by the local officials formed a team, collecting from one village after another. In order to avoid the eyes and ears of others, the cattle and horses were sold on the spot. After he arrived in Songpan, all that was left were more than ten horses and more than ten cattle. It is said that two more had been taken to Chengdu. I don't know whose wealth it is."

The Commander is Detained

On January 19, 1949, Ma Bijie returned, and the families of the four victims detained Commander Ma, who was wearing a fox skin and a fox hat, with the aura of a barbarian king, and Zhan Wu Qiushui, Mo Li Wanrong, Wang Kaiyuan, Liu Shican, and other family members asked him to settle the blood debt and have a discussion.

The commander pointed east and west for a while. As a result, under the relentless pursuit of Xie Qusheng, Zhang Junte, Feng Xueqiao, Zhang Bohuai, and other friends from the news industry who were friends of Jinshui before his death, they asked him to provide a guarantee. The chairman and vice-chairman of the Provincial Assembly, Xiang Chuanyi and He Songshu, provided the guarantee.

Although some people in the newspaper shouted, "Grassland! You are a dangerous path!" but the Siguo Lu incident may become just a drop in the ocean in this great era!

### Exploration of the Wuyi Fluorite Mining Area (Part 1)

— Our reporter Jiang Feng

[Our newspaper Jinhua 5th dispatch] Fluorite, originally named Fluorite, is a mineral belonging to the isometric crystal system. It often appears as beautiful cubic crystals, many of which are transparent and have a glass-like luster with perfect cleavage in four directions. Because the main component of the ore contains fluorine, it is called fluorite. Also, because it can emit green light like a firefly after being heated, it is commonly known as green fluorite. Fluorite is commonly green in color, and the villagers call it green stone. In fact, the color of fluorite is not only green, but also yellow, purple, light blue, reddish-brown, gray, and even colorless. The main use of fluorite is as a flux for iron smelting and a solvent for other metals, accounting for more than 80% of the total output. Other uses include the manufacture of explosives, glassware, enamelware, porcelainware, etc., and pure and transparent fluorite can be carved into various utensils and decorations.

The production areas of fluorite, in addition to Linxiang in Hunan, Jiaoxian in Shandong, Longhua in Jehol, and Jiaocheng in Shanxi, are most notable and abundant in Zhejiang, accounting for more than 90% of the total national output. In Zhejiang, the fluorite mines of Wuyi have the richest reserves, estimated at about 200,000 tons. The production area is estimated to be about 2479.00 hectares, with an average annual output of about 2000 tons.

The surface rock layer of the Wuyi fluorite mine is very shallow, only a few inches to three or five feet from the ground, so mining is very easy. As early as before 1918, local residents accidentally discovered it while clearing mountains, and thus began to dig. They soon realized that it could be exchanged for money, so they dug it manually and transported it to the river, down the Wuyi River, through Jinhua, and by boat to Hangzhou and Shanghai for sale, but the output was not large. Later, the residents realized that the economic benefits of fluorite were very large, so they started mining in groups, but limited by manual mining and transportation conditions, there was no large-scale organization. By 1934, when the construction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was completed, transportation became convenient, so private mine merchants organized companies to carry out larger-scale mining, but the mining methods were still primitive, and the output was not significant. One or two years before the Anti-Japanese War, the Zhejiang Provincial government authorities intended to organize a provincial-run company, raise funds, and purchase new mining machinery. Initial plans were made, but the war broke out, and it was suspended. After the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Incident in 1942, Jinhua, Wuyi, and other places successively fell into enemy hands. The enemy sent experts to Jinhua and Wuyi to investigate and conduct detailed surveys. In less than three months, they planned large-scale mining, requisitioned civilian labor, and built a light railway between Jinhua and Wuyi, directly to the mining area. They also transported mining machinery from Japan and forcibly conscripted thousands of civilians to carry out mining under the auspices of the puppet Central China Mining Company. At its peak, the number of miners reached tens of thousands, with a daily output of about 1,000 tons. It was transported from the Jinhua-Wuyi light railway to the Jinhua railway station for accumulation, and then transshipped to Shanghai. At that time, fluorite piled up like a mountain in the western mining area of Jinhua station. The enemy operated for three years and stole a considerable amount, about 50,000 tons or more.

According to local survey data, the distribution of Wuyi fluorite mines is approximately in the following areas:

(1) Shilonggang: Five li from the city, three li to Shuikou by waterway. The average vein width is two meters, the length is 355 meters, the mined length is 195 meters, the deepest part of the pit is 28 meters, the surrounding rock is rhyolite, the reserves are about 53,000 tons, and the ore quality is medium.

### Rampant Off-Exchange Gold Trading; National Bank Heavily Sold Off Again Yesterday, Retreating Sharply from 4 Million to 3.25 Million

[Report from our Newspaper] Yesterday, the gold market did not implement the cancellation of price limits and resumption of free trading, as the official order had not been received. Therefore, trading remained suspended. The opening bid in the morning reached the upper limit of 2.737 million, with demand exceeding supply and no transactions occurring. The situation remained deadlocked in the afternoon, and members left the market one after another before closing.

However, off-exchange trading became increasingly rampant. According to reporters, trading was divided into spot and futures. Spot trading was settled with same-day bank drafts, with immediate entry and exit. Futures required a 20% margin, with no daily settlement. Both buyers and sellers only needed to pay interest and adjust the difference, allowing for convenient trading. As a result, all parties flocked to it, and the activity was no less than that of the stock market. Yesterday, the market retreated sharply as government and merchants fiercely battled. In the morning, due to concerns about pressure, some buyers attempted to push prices up. The opening bid was 3.15 million and 3.25 million, briefly falling to 3.10 million and 3.20 million. Midway through the day, rumors of large-denomination banknotes being issued and loose credit conditions led securities firms and financial institutions to push prices up to 3.35 million and 3.40 million. The Central Bank sold 500-600 large bars at 3.30 million, but the strong buying sentiment prevailed. Near noon, under the competitive absorption of northern and Cantonese banks, prices rose sharply, and the market situation became chaotic. Prices rose from 3.50 million and 3.60 million to 3.80 million and 3.90 million by the noon close, approaching the 4 million mark. In the afternoon, the Central Bank refused to show weakness and offered overnight deposits to please customers, selling unlimited amounts, from 3.60 million all the way down to 3.25 million, secretly releasing around 3,000-5,000 large bars. About 10 billion in overnight funds are expected to be squeezed in this morning. Futures opened at 3.60 million and 3.80 million, falling to 3.17 million and 3.22 million, and closed at 3.20 million and 3.25 million. The overnight interest for both buyers and sellers was 3.25 million per tael, resulting in a net decrease of 50,000 compared to the previous day.

[Report from our Newspaper] Lin Chongyong, Director of the Business Bureau of the National Bank, told reporters yesterday that the gold market price showed signs of renewed activity today (the 11th). In order to stabilize gold prices, the National Bank specifically sold a total of 13,400 taels of gold in the morning and afternoon. 3,000-4,000 taels were sold in the morning. In the afternoon, hearing that the overnight gold settlement price had reached 4 million, approximately 10,000 taels were continuously sold, pushing the gold market price down to 3.25 million per tael (including the day's interest).

When reporters inquired about the restructuring of the gold industry market, he said he had not heard of it but believed that the financial authorities were studying the matter. Regarding the report that the Central Mint was preparing to issue Yuan Datou silver dollars for the National Bank, Lin stated that this was not the case. As for the reports of supervisory committee members visiting the National Bank for inquiries, Lin also said that he had not been contacted.

[Report from our Newspaper] Gold jewelry prices at silver shops changed several times a day. In the morning, they were listed at 3.20 million and 3.55 million, and in the afternoon they rose to 3.30 million and 3.65 million, a further increase of 700,000 compared to the previous day. Silver jewelry rose to 30,000 and 45,000, an increase of 5,000 as well. Currency exchange dealers were very active, with same-day cash settlement. The morning rate was 3.50 million and 3.70 million, and the noon rate dropped to 3.30 million and 3.50 million, with no further changes in the afternoon.

[Report from our Newspaper] Yesterday, the off-exchange fluctuation of US dollars was also dramatic. The morning opening was 68,000 and 73,000. With demand exceeding supply, prices rose all the way to 78,000 and 83,000 at the noon close. Trading was thin in the afternoon. The final same-day settlement was quoted at 65,000 and 70,000, with few transactions. The overnight rate was quoted at 68,000 and 73,000. Overall, there was not much change compared to the previous day.

### Market Sentiment is Excited, Chinese Stocks All Hit Upper Limit, Afternoon Trend Weakened Before Closing

[Report from our Newspaper] The atmosphere of peace talks is becoming increasingly clear, the loose money market continues, and stock market sentiment is completely boiling. Both popular and unpopular stocks hit their upper limits. Wing On Textiles opened at 33 yuan. Off-exchange sellers had given up and were quietly observing. On-exchange buyers were attempting a squeeze, leading to exuberant buying sentiment and a rise to 36.5 yuan. Small investors were concerned about selling pressure and sold at higher prices, pushing the price down to 34.4 yuan. Subsequently, rumors emerged that the new financial and economic supplementary plan included the issuance of more silver dollar notes. Gold and textiles prices surged, and various groups uniformly began buying, causing a sudden and rapid change in the market trend. Prices rose all the way to the upper limit of 37.2 yuan.

Small and medium-sized stocks showed consistent strength. Mya opened at 0.94 yuan at the upper limit and remained firm at the noon close. Sun Kwong suddenly became popular near closing, reaching the upper limit of 2.59 yuan. King Fook at 1.222 yuan also hit the upper limit. Shun Ho opened at 7.5 yuan, and later rose to the upper limit of 7.92 yuan. Keen Hing at 1.73 yuan also reached the limit. Other miscellaneous stocks also hit their upper limits.

In the afternoon, due to continued loose funds and high opening gold prices, buying sentiment continued, and the market trend remained firm. Later, news emerged that the Central Bank was selling gold, and the tight money situation slightly shifted, causing prices to soften near closing. The total trading volume for the day was 3.16485 billion shares.

The gold public bonds continued to rise yesterday. The money market trended toward looser conditions, and the situation improved. The spot price of gold soared, and sentiment followed suit. Opening at 1.1 million, it rose to 1.22 million, and reached the upper limit of 1.32 million at noon. 44 taels were traded.

The initial bid in the afternoon was 1.32 million for buying, but because there were no sellers, no transactions occurred.

Foreign stocks rose sharply again yesterday. Money conditions eased, gold prices rose quickly, and buying sentiment was strong from all sides. Ewo Textiles was at 92,000 yuan and 94,000 yuan, a continued increase of 17,000 yuan. Union Insurance was at 103,000 yuan and 106,000 yuan, rising by 16,000 yuan. Ewo Brewery was at 17,500 yuan and 18,500 yuan. Jebsen & Co. was at 34,000 yuan and 36,000 yuan. Asia was at 9,300 yuan and 9,500 yuan, each rising by about 10%. Wheelock Marden was bidding at 350,000 yuan, with private transactions up 90,000 yuan.

### Tea Market Trading Not Active

[Report from our Newspaper] A prominent tea merchant informed reporters yesterday that, given the continuous surge in prices and the devaluation of currency, tea merchants were mostly shifting their focus to foreign exchange. As a result, the recent trend in the tea market has been weak. Prices fluctuate rapidly, but sellers, uncertain about the market, are mostly holding back, resulting in limited actual trading and mostly empty bids.

It was also learned that the production cost of Chinese tea is still higher than the international market price, leading to a gradual decline in exports. If tea prices continue to rise, the industry will face external strength but internal weakness. As a major export commodity, the future of tea is becoming increasingly precarious.

### Silver Dollars Overwhelm Gold Yuan; Market Price Grows Daily

[Report from our Newspaper] Since the Stock Exchange Building disallowed the use of same-day notes as collateral, silver dollar exchange transactions have been unable to operate. Recently, a new path has been developed, switching to the exchange of gold and silver without physical transfer. Transactions have been quite lively. Yesterday morning, the initial ratio of gold to silver was one tael of gold for 51 large-head silver dollars to buy and one tael of gold for 53 large-head silver dollars to sell. Near noon, the ratio went from 50, 52, and then fell to 49, 51. Small-head silver dollars initially traded at 65, 70, and then retreated to 63, 68 at noon. In the afternoon, they fell further to 60, 65. Eagle silver dollars were at 90, 95. Other ratios were 80 small-head silver dollars for 100 large-head silver dollars and 60 large-head silver dollars for 100 eagle silver dollars. Other ratios included 11 silver dollars for a 10 US dollar note.

[Report from our Newspaper] Yesterday, silver dollar arbitrage rates were as follows: Tianjin arbitrage was at 2 yuan per 100 yuan, with the physical delivery of bank drafts delayed by one day. Fuzhou arbitrage was at 3 yuan per 100 yuan. Hunan arbitrage was a 5-day term for physical delivery, with an increase of 2 yuan per 100 yuan. Wanxian arbitrage was at a premium of 5 to 10 yuan per 100 yuan. Exporters who have small discrepancies were arbitraging, with Ganzhou arbitrage offering a premium of 15 yuan per 100 yuan, and the bank drafts were delivered in physical silver seven days later.

Street trading was brisk due to higher prices in other areas. Supplies from all areas decreased daily, and expectations for higher prices increased. Large-head silver dollars initially traded at 62,000 and 65,000, and then rose to 66,000 and 70,000. The market situation became chaotic in the afternoon, and bids rose to 73,000 and 78,000. In the evening, as gold prices fell, they went down to 65,000 and 69,000. Small-head silver dollars were at 54,000 and 58,000. Eagle silver dollars were at 38,000 and 43,000. Transactions using bank drafts reached 75,000 and 80,000 at one point. In the afternoon, they also retreated to 70,000 and 75,000, each an increase of 5,000 compared to the previous day.

[Report from our Newspaper] Street silver dollar prices have been soaring in recent days. According to investigations made by our newspaper's reporters, the reasons are as follows: since last Thursday, factories have been making every effort to absorb silver dollars in preparation for mid-month payroll. Since the cash panic at the end of last month, the lack of cash funds for payroll has been the most difficult issue for factories. The tight cash situation has not eased, and mid-month is approaching rapidly. Therefore, they are initially buying silver dollars to alleviate the difficulty of payroll, which is one reason. Most industrial and commercial firms have begun distributing their profits from the first half of the year, and issuing official interest and dividends converted to silver dollars is the most convenient thing to do, which is another reason. The rise in silver dollar prices in Nanjing and Bengbu-Xuzhou areas is more pronounced than in Shanghai, especially in front-line areas such as Zhenjiang, where prices are universally higher than in Shanghai. Therefore, yesterday, individuals were carrying large amounts of cash near the North Station to purchase and transport them. In terms of yesterday's market conditions, the North was high and the South was low in the morning, and then the North was low in the afternoon, and the South was low and the North was high in the evening. This trend is greatly related to the purchases made by these individuals, which is another reason. With the issuance of silver dollar notes imminent, the general mentality is more interested in silver dollars, which is the fourth reason. The shortage of supplies from other areas and large-scale preparations, combined with arbitrage relationships, have tightened the market considerably, which is the fifth reason. Ordinary stores in this city are already engaged in the buying and selling of silver dollars and welcome bartering. The use of silver dollars is becoming increasingly common, which is the sixth reason. The silver dollar market situation has become frenzied.

### Cotton Yarn Prices Soar Across the Board; High-End Cloth Prices End

Yesterday, the yarn market experienced significant fluctuations. The credit conditions and foreign conditions were still favorable for buying. Powerful large merchants were recklessly active. Reproduction companies in the street continued their enthusiastic search. Under the cover of buying sentiment, new high prices appeared endlessly for various yarns.

42-count Blue Phoenix rose directly from 22 million yuan to 27 million yuan at closing, a drastic increase of 7.5 million yuan compared to the weekend. 21-count Double Horse spot initially opened at 11.5 million yuan, and after briefly declining to 10.9 million yuan, it was raised to 12.7 million yuan at the end, a surge of 3.2 million yuan. Factory orders finally closed at 10,000 yuan lower than the spot price.

20-count Double Horse also broke through the major mark, reaching a new high of 11.8 million yuan. 16-count yarns were traded around 10 million yuan, and other coarse and fine yarns jumped by about 30%.

New highs continued to appear for cotton cloth, as credit conditions in the market remained loose and prices in other areas were soaring. As a result, merchants from other areas had strong buying interest, and local merchants were also actively buying. Cloth prices opened steadily, similar to off-exchange bids from the previous day. Prices initially fell but after 9:30 am, news broke that gold prices were rising, revitalizing sentiment. The market ended at high prices.

Dragon Head Fine Cloth opened at 375,000 yuan and lingered for a long time. Near noon, it broke through the major mark, reaching a new peak of 430,000 yuan. The final trade was at 425,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 100,000 yuan compared to the weekend.

Four Gentlemen Serge fell from 370,000 to 352,000 yuan, reaching a high of 400,300 yuan and finally closing at 398,000 yuan, a jump of 83,000 yuan. The after-market saw sharp rises and falls. Dragon Head Fine Cloth initially opened at 490,000 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge opened at 460,000 yuan. Midway through, both briefly showed leaps in price. Later, the news that peace talks were promising led to a sharp decline of 40% in Nanjing prices, causing sentiment to collapse. In the end, the former traded at 470,000 yuan and the latter at 436,000 yuan, with further price reductions after closing.

Yarn Sales by China Textile Construction Corporation

### Artificial Silk Curves Upwards; Silk Goods Rise to the Limit

The initial price of superior grade raw silk opened at 20 million yuan yesterday morning. Around 10:00 am, the price fluctuated with no clear trend. After 10:00 am, due to the rise in gold and banknotes, the price rose to 21 million yuan, an increase of approximately 5 million yuan compared to the previous Saturday. However, there were few transactions, only around 10 bales.

Yesterday, Tianqiao and Xinghiss artificial silk opened at 11.2 million yuan for immediate delivery. Due to weak buying sentiment, the price slightly declined. The current bill initially traded at 11.4 million yuan. Later, because the National Bank did not sell gold or materials, sentiment stabilized, buying sentiment became strong again, and the price rose directly, closing at 13.8 million yuan at noon, an increase of 2.3 million yuan compared to Saturday.

Yesterday, Huaqiang silk bedding rose to the market limit of 20% upon opening, closing at 74.16 million yuan, with continued strong buying sentiment. Off-exchange transactions rose to 84 million yuan at one point, and then fell to 8.2 million yuan as the final price. There was little other interest, and trading was scarce.

### China Trust Bureau Agrees on Rayon Allocation Price

[Report from our Newspaper] The China Trust Bureau's rayon meeting yesterday decided on the rayon price for the fifteenth period of this year (April 11 to April 16). The price of Italian goods was 10,240,000 yuan per case of 120-denier Grade 3 glossy, and 11,180,000 yuan per case of 120-denier Grade 3 matte.

### Production Prices Surge, Sentiment Firm; Rice Prices Soar 30%; White Jing Rice and Bo Dao Rice Trade at 430,000 Yuan

Yesterday, the rice market saw a significant rise in prices at the production area, and sentiment was extremely firm. With the continuous increase in gold and banknotes on Sunday, holders deliberately tried to catch up, aggressively raising prices at the opening. All grades of rice jumped by 30%. White Jing rice and Bo Dao rice rose to 430,000, and cash also reached 380,000 yuan. The market supply was extremely scarce, and trading was light. The situation in the North Market was similar, with a total of over 6,000 shi arriving at both markets.

Flour

The rising trend remained strong. Opening prices were affected by the soaring prices of various goods abroad on Sunday, and all brands of flour jumped by more than 20%. The Central Market heard that the Central Bank was selling in large quantities, and holders sold to take profits, causing the market trend to suddenly reverse. After closing, gold continued to rise, and sentiment suddenly became tense, causing the market to surge again. Old Truck brand was quoted at 145,000 yuan, and Battleship brand rose to 141,500 yuan.

Grains

The market trend remained firm. Soybeans initially rose and then declined. At the opening, liquor businesses were absorbing them, and winter beans broke through the 400,000 mark. At closing, factory demand was not strong, and prices fell back to the 400,000 mark. Raw peanuts were quoted at 900,000. Red sorghum rose by more than 40,000. Corn was strongly absorbed by gangs, and the market trend rose steadily. Mung beans continued to rise, and sesame did not trade at opening.

Edible Oil

Prices have been rising sharply in recent days, and the after-market saw a reversal yesterday. The initial price of factory soybean oil was as high as 2.4 million yuan, closing at 2.3 million yuan, a slight increase of 100,000 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. The supply of crude oil was relatively scarce, rising by 10%. Crude rapeseed oil was once as high as 2.15 million, and later retreated to the 2 million mark. Soybean cake was initially flat and then firm, with Changzi cake closing at 126,000.

### Rice Price Controls to Be Enforced Again

Rice price controls in this city, which had been lifted for only two days, were re-implemented yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau stipulated that the wholesale price of white rice at each rice shop should be 380,000 yuan, and the retail price should be 418,000 yuan. A request has been sent to the police bureau to instruct each branch to investigate.

### Market Ramblings

Discussion of Why Rent Increases Tied to the Price Index Must Be Closely Guarded

The Municipal Government recently held a "Temporary Municipal Affairs Meeting" with very tight security. It was thought that there were some major proposals, but it turned out that it was just to pass a method for "Rent Adjustment Based on the Price Index," and incidentally passed a resolution to "Adjust Property Taxes Based on the Price Index" as well. Afterwards, the security has still been very tight. It is said that it is to prevent social opposition, making it difficult for the Municipal Council to pass the motion. Procedurally, these types of matters do not count unless passed by the Municipal Council. Therefore, before submitting it to the Municipal Council, and before arranging it properly among the Municipal Councilors, the security must be tight!

It is said that the proposal to adjust rent based on the price index was a suggestion from the Municipal Affairs Office. Not long ago, when the news was spread by various newspapers, I criticized it here. However, property owners expressed dissatisfaction with the Municipal Affairs Office's proposal. They "do not oppose" adjusting rent based on the price index, but they think the base number proposed by the Municipal Affairs Office is "too low." This shows that the Municipal Affairs Office is not standing on the same side as the large landlords. Of course, the Municipal Affairs Office should stand on the same side as the majority of citizens, and should not collude with the minority of large landlords. The citizens are truly blessed. So why is the security so tight?

Remember since the August 13th Incident, rent has been under strict control. For more than ten years, all the authorities' controls have failed, and the only control that has been successful is rent control. If there was no such success, all citizens and the business community would be much worse off than they are now!

There are 5 to 6 million citizens in Shanghai, and at most 2 to 3 thousand large landlords. If rent were allowed to increase like commodity prices, many businesses would have to close down, and even more citizens would be driven to sleep under eaves and on the streets.

As soon as the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out, large landlords took harsh measures against tenants, so the Chinese authorities and the concession authorities stepped in to control rent in order to stabilize residents. During the occupied period, the enemy and puppet authorities also valued the fact that residents must be stable, and followed the established rules. Since victory, even though the mayor has only changed twice, there have been countless activities by large landlords to lift rent controls. However, the municipal authorities all know that this is a major matter that cannot be loosened. In particular, the Municipal Council has always been able to speak out righteously on the rent issue and strike a blow. So until now, there is peace and tranquility, and all citizens and the business community are immensely blessed.

Now, the Municipal Affairs Office's suggestion to adjust rent based on the price index can be described as "reckless action" and "extraordinary boldness." But they also know that this is a major matter. Even though the mayor is not here, they are very energetic. I really don't know what they are up to?

Based on the Municipal Council's past serious attitude towards the rent issue, it is presumed that this time will be no exception and they will not act recklessly. But I don't know who will be the first to take action and fight!

The Nanjing Road Tenants Association best represents the will of the business community and citizens of this city. For the sake of the economic and social stability of all Shanghai citizens, they have always been concerned about this issue. Now, when everyone is struggling to survive, their burden is being increased. What is their intention? It's really hard to imagine!

All Citizens Are Struggling to Survive, Hoping Councilors Will Speak Out Righteously

### Ping Pong Opening Postponed Due to Overwhelming Crowds

[Report from our Newspaper] The 4th Ping Pong League was originally scheduled to open last night at the Jinmen Ping Pong Room on Fujian South Road, with a marquee match between top-tier teams Huamei and Quanlu. More than 2,000 ping pong fans arrived, filling the room to capacity, making it impossible to hold the match. The committee had to announce that the match would be rescheduled. The enthusiasm for ping pong in this city is unprecedented. The Jinmen Ping Pong Room offered its venue for free, but chairs and tables were damaged, for which the committee expressed its apologies. Tonight, there will be six B-group matches held at various locations, with the schedule as follows:

Shanbao - Erhua (B1) 7:00 PM Shanbao

Shuping - Jianxin (B1) 7:00 PM Jingzong

### Ping Pong World: Players and Events

Renowned ping pong referee Chen Jimao suddenly suffered from chronic enteritis a month ago. He was treated at the Municipal Fifth Hospital. With the careful treatment of the hospital's doctors, he is recovering and good fortune has befallen him. He has made many contributions to the league and is a member of this year's committee.

Jiang Zongdi, a veteran player from the "Evening Glow Team" in Suzhou, represented the Qibu team against the Jewish Allied Forces 7 or 8 years ago, innovatively using hard balls in ping pong matches to achieve victory. Jiang, nicknamed "Soy Sauce Radish," joined the China Agricultural Machinery Company last year, and formed the Zhongnong Ping Pong Team to join the workers' cup competition, ranking third in the division. Apart from Zongdi, all the team members are newcomers. This result is not weak. This time, they signed up for the B-group league to compete for the championship. Because the China Agricultural Bank had already registered a team named Zhongnong, to avoid duplicate names, they decided to change the name to "Agricultural Machinery." Jiang will serve as the team captain.

Fan Liangji and Lu Yongkang, current members of the Quanlu team, have both played for the Jinlong and Lianxing teams, and can be called like-minded friends. Not long ago, the two married a pair of Wang sisters on the same day and at the same time at the Dali Restaurant. From then on, Fan and Lu went from being friends to brothers-in-law, which can be said to be a blessing!

Chen Enrong is a talented player on the Huayan volleyball team. This time, Chen used his qualifications as captain of the Nongji B-team to form a team to participate in this year's league. However, all the registration procedures were handled by his wife, Hu Jiahe. Jiahe was one of the five leading players of the Girls' Qing Ping Pong Team eight years ago. She was skilled in cutting and achieved great success. She is now a good wife and mother, and has long given up this sport. People like them can be called a "blessed couple."

Qian Guanqin, the captain of the Youth Team, which was last year's B-group champion, said that since last winter, the team has lacked someone responsible for team affairs, and the team members have scattered, effectively halting operations. As a result, it is difficult to revive the team and continue to join this year's league. Qian himself has also lost the opportunity to participate in the competition, and he has feelings of sadness!

### Sports World: Hua Lian Completes Hegemony, Defeats Encas in Final Battle, Takes Home the Championship

[Our Reporter] The basketball league's A Group completed its schedule last night. In the final game, champion Hua Lian team narrowly defeated Encas by three points. Hua Lian led by as many as twelve points in the first half, 27-15, and the final score was 42-39. There was an interlude before the game: the referees' Old Boys team defeated the Basketball Committee, 47-43. Before the start of the A Group games, an award ceremony was held. Hua Lian team won four consecutive championships. Shao Rugan, a staff member of the Sports Association, presented the award, and Ren Xiangcheng, the captain of the Hua Lian team, accepted the championship trophy. The ceremony was completed amidst applause. The audience in the gymnasium was enthusiastic last night, declaring a full house, with an estimated 2,000-3,000 people.

After the award ceremony, the Hua Lian-Encas battle began. Both sides guarded closely, making scoring difficult. Encas took an early lead of 4-0, but Hua Lian caught up to tie the score at 5-5. The score then fluctuated between the two sides, making it difficult to tell who would win. After ten minutes, the score was tied at 11-11. Afterwards, Liu Fushan and Da Li's skillful shots suddenly allowed Hua Lian to gradually gain the upper hand. At the end of the first half, Encas was trailing by as many as twelve points. In the second half, Da Li felt unwell and was replaced by Le Jiazhou. Hua Lian continued to lead all the way, but the gap between the two sides gradually narrowed. In the last ten minutes, the difference was only six points. Liu Fushan fouled out after committing his fifth foul, and Zhang Liangxiong came on, making the situation even more critical. At this time, the score was 39-35. Then, Bo Tou and Que Li scored two consecutive baskets, bringing Encas to within two points of Hua Lian at 41-39. At this time, there were still two and a half minutes left in the game. Although Hua Lian used the "Mahjong" tactic to try to delay the time, Hua Lian scored one more point in the last ten seconds, sealing the victory at 42-39. Hua Lian defeated Encas again to complete its hegemony.

Liu Fushan's performance last night was outstanding, with skillful shots one after another, as if divinely aided, making him a major contributor. Li Zhenzhong was the central soul of the whole team, but his retirement in the second half created such a dangerous situation, otherwise it would never have come to this. Bao Songyuan also played well, but Wu Chengzhang had no room to develop. Encas missed many shots last night, which was also a matter of luck.

### Women's Basketball Technique

— Translated and Described by Qi Gong

(II) Dead ball.

(A) After failing to intercept the ball of the receiver, when he is about to catch the ball, the players of this team should try to move forward to prevent him from passing the ball out, and must hold the ball tightly to become a dead ball. After the dead ball, a jump ball must be held, and both sides have an equal opportunity to get the ball.

(B) Players must be proficient in jumping high enough, jumping straight up, using their fingertips to push the ball higher and forward into the hands of the intended receiver, and it is best to signal with a secret sign before the jump ball.

(I) In order to avoid being closely marked, the forward must jump high and use his fingertips to push the ball to the open space near the basket before the rebound comes back, so that the receiver can immediately shoot after receiving the ball.

(II) The guard should jump high and use his fingertips to push the ball away from the important area under the basket when grabbing the ball under the basket, and it is most suitable to push the ball to the sideline. After the dead ball, when both sides jump the ball, a guard should be left in the position before the basket to ensure safety.

(III) Interception Midway.

(A) Players must have a sense of premonition and be able to quickly change their steps and directions, and they must also coordinate in time to be able to intercept the opponent's pass midway.

(B) With proficient basic skills, the body is flexible and controlled, and the chance of fouling is reduced.

(C) Players must see clearly that they are sure of interception before attempting to intercept, or at least obstruct the opponent's passing, so that the pass is skewed and loses its accuracy.

(D) Application of secret sign gestures.

(I) Players should have the need to use secret sign gestures in the following situations.

(A) When both sides jump the ball in the center circle.

(B) When throwing the boundary ball.

(C) When a jump ball is held after a dead ball.

(D) When taking a fixed formation.

(II) The secret signs and gestures are classified as follows.

(A) Verbal secret signs, (I) shouting out numbers, secret signs, or terms.

(B) Issuing gestures so that teammates can perform actions by seeing the gestures.

(I) Raising a finger to signal, (II) shaking the hand, arm, or foot to signal, (III) signaling the direction the center is running towards the center circle.

(III) In order to save time, the center forward can issue secret signs and gestures to signal to the other two forwards at the same time when he enters the center circle before receiving the ball and launching the offensive, and the other two forwards should immediately prepare to implement the planned strategy when the referee passes the ball to the center forward.

Forward group offensive techniques.

### Regarding Expanding Grain Storage

— Lei Ting

Recently, the authorities are once again clamoring for expanding grain storage.

Based on the ancient teaching of "be prepared for unforeseen circumstances," coupled with the current experience of soaring rice prices, the idea of "storing" grain has become common knowledge for every citizen. And now this common knowledge has long been widely ingrained among the people, so it seems unnecessary for the authorities to "expand" the propaganda.

This is not to say that there is any criticism of the grain storage methods, nor is it to oppose the expansion movement, but to honestly say: because the people regard "food" as heaven, and because of the hardships of life in recent years, everyone already understands the value of materials and paper money, and there will never be an idiot who saves paper money. Therefore, if the performance of "storage" is not enough, it is only a matter of "strength."

I remember not long ago, the authorities also reminded us: each household should prepare three months' worth of food storage. This warning was absolutely well-intentioned, and it was also telling citizens to "be prepared for unforeseen circumstances," just as this expansion of grain storage is absolutely well-intentioned. However, what was the result? I dare not say. Because among the more than five million citizens, those who can prepare three months' worth of food storage in one go probably account for only a very small fraction of a small number, and the benefits are naturally very few. On the contrary, the general propertied class, given this reminder, became even more alert, believing that there was a problem with rice, and therefore stored a lot. Even worse, they shifted their attention to other daily necessities and stockpiled them in the same way. With competitive buying, the grain that the authorities pointed out should be stored, as well as other daily necessities that were not pointed out, took the opportunity to rise sharply, so that the small people, who could originally store grain for three days, had it cut in half, and even could not store grain for one day.

In today's social and economic situation, the majority of citizens have already fallen into the small people class. Doing a day's work and buying a day's food is the living situation of the general laboring class; doing a month's work, and at the end of the month when the salary is received, being able to buy how many days' worth of grain for the next month is still a mystery, which is the living situation of the general salaried class.

Under these circumstances, the majority of citizens have the heart but not the strength, so the effect of this expanded grain storage is naturally obvious.

As of the time of writing this article, rice prices are said to have exceeded the 300,000 mark, and I hope that tomorrow it will not create any records because of the advocacy of expanding grain storage. If the benefits of grain storage are there but not here, then the small people who do not have the power to "store" will really have no food to eat.

### Examination of Surname Character Decomposition

— Jin Yuan

Nowadays, when ordinary people exchange names, they often use character decomposition to describe the surname, such as walking Xiao Zhao, mouth sky Wu, bow long Zhang, etc. Although these are vulgar and do not conform to the six scripts, examining their origin, they do indeed have a long history. I will try to record what I have seen and correct the learned.

The Biography of Kong Rong in the Book of the Later Han says: "Why must the one who has the world have a Mao Jin knife?" This Mao Jin knife is the origin of Liu. Also, the Biography of Dong Zhuo says: "At the beginning of Emperor Xian's reign, the nursery rhyme in the capital said: A thousand miles of grass, how green, ten days to divine, cannot live." This thousand miles of grass is the origin of Dong. The Outer Biography of the Book of Yuejue says: "The text belongs to Ding, from Yu Bangxian, takes the mouth as the surname, and inherits it with the sky"; Guo Zhongshu's Pei Zhai cited the National History, saying: "The mouth in the sky is Wu," this mouth sky is the origin of Wu. Wen Daya's Great Tang Founding Living Notes cited the Buddhist nun Huihua's poem, saying: "Eighteen sons in the East China Sea, enter the well and call the three armies, holding double white birds in their hands, wearing purple clouds on their heads"; this eighteen sons is the origin of Li. Hong Mai's Kezhai Three Notes says: "Mu Yi has already been an official in the Ministry of Works, and bow long has worked as an editor"; this Mu Yi is Yang, and bow long is the origin of Zhang. From this, we can see that worldly customs and sayings all have origins, and are not all fabricated.

### Two Chapters on Singing Falling Flowers

— Zhi

Using the original rhyme of the late Mr. Xu Xiaoyun of Shanyin and his son Mr. Jun, Lianju

(I)

The crimson dye covers the ground, the horse's hooves solidify (Huo), looking back, the road wants to get lost. The catkins gather and disperse with the smoke from far and near (Zhi), the branches of short and long remain green at different heights. Do not say that the tide is unfaithful if it comes late (Huo), all get up late because the island does not crow. Zhu will eventually ride the wind and return (Zhi), do you remember in the previous life that you were spring mud? ( )

(II)

The shade of the corner courtyard ends this life (Zhi), who will remember the year on the spiritual monument. The shark pearls have been cried out and are difficult to form tears (Huo), and the silkworm silk is mostly not tied to spring. It is vain to say that the magical formula can retain the scenery (Zhi), and it is unbearable to see that dust has already grown on the dressing case. Singing the song of red bean Acacia is exhausted (Huo), it is difficult to find a confidant in the south.

### Outside Notes on Watching a Play

— Tan Ke

March 29th, on leave. This is such a rare day off other than Sunday! The Lanyin Theater is staging the three-act comedy "Setting an Example." My chest, which has been stifled for a long time, should be relaxed a bit, so I invited a partner to watch "Setting an Example."

In order to save a bit of fare, walking was too time-consuming, so I decided to ride a bicycle. Although the bike wasn't very "stylish," it was stable and fast gliding on the Boluo Road. Lanyin was in sight in less than ten minutes. When I got to Lanyin, I rushed to buy tickets. There were no empty seats in the front row, so I had to buy tickets for the back row. Fortunately, the Lanyin Theater wasn't very big, and the back row was quite good, and it was still a balcony seat!

After buying the tickets, I thought about the problem of where to put the bike. S, who went with me, suggested storing it at a friend's house. However, the friend's house was quite a long way from Lanyin. It would be easy to ride there now, but we would have to walk to get the bike after the show, and everyone felt a little unmotivated. So we turned the bike around and stopped in front of Lanyin again, thinking about locking it nearby to a tree or telephone pole on the sidewalk. I thought it would be okay to just hand it over to the "bike parking station" in front of Lanyin, and pay a few bucks. There was unanimous agreement. S locked the bike, and I asked the price. There were two people to "come and negotiate," one was a middle-aged man, in his thirties or forties, wearing short clothes; the other was a woman in her forties or fifties, wearing a cheongsam.

But the answer after asking the price was a simple sentence:

"Four hundred yuan per bike!" One---is called bargaining.

"Is two hundred yuan okay?"---This is haggling.

"Three hundred yuan, according to yesterday's price, can't push it down any further!"---This is, of course, a concession.

However, S seemed impatient:

"It only costs a thousand yuan a month to park a bike at the school, let's lock it somewhere else!" He opened the chain of the already locked bike again.

After locking the bike, it was time to rush in and take our seats. I was very uneasy, but there was nothing I could do: would the bike be hidden or would some parts be taken off? ---No, that must be overthinking.

The play on stage came to an end, and S left his seat, saying that he was going to take a look at the bike. It turned out that he was also a little uneasy. S's report back was:

"Looking down from the window, the bike is leaning quietly against the tree, safe and sound." So everyone was happy.

At 4:45, the play ended. The bike was still leaning quietly against the tree, but the bell on it had been removed and the rear tire had been deflated.

As for that "bike parking station"? There was no way to find it, and no need to find it.

### Panorama of the Universe

— Cang Yi

The natives of the Transvaal region of South Africa regard wives and concubines as their main property. The more wives a person has, the richer his property is. If they encounter financial difficulties, they can transfer them to others, and they can still make up for it if they have money. The selling price of wives and concubines ranges from two to sixteen pounds.

Greece reformed its currency four years ago, with a ratio of 50 billion to one; Hungary also reformed its currency three years ago, with a ratio of 4 followed by twenty-nine zeros to one.

There is an unmarried female monkey in the Campbell Circus in the United States who has her own savings in the bank. All deposit and withdrawal procedures are based on her "hand" print as proof. It is said that the amount of her savings is very considerable.

### "The More the Cheaper"

— Suo Bei

A good play should not be sung twice.

Even if the music is as beautiful as "The Blue Danube," if you listen to it more than a dozen times, it will make people feel that "the Danube has flooded."

In particular, banknotes should not be printed too much, because if they are printed too much, it will be too late to print later.

Even the most beautiful "slogan" is best shouted sparingly. When it is shouted out for the first time, it is extremely beautiful. Afterwards, when everyone follows along, it feels vulgar and harsh.

Therefore, Maupassant said: "The first person to compare a woman to a flower is a genius, the second person to compare a woman to a flower is a mediocre person, and the third person to compare a woman to a flower is a stupid person!"

If humans had never used animals as food, then today, if someone were found dissecting the bodies of pigs and sheep, it would be a shocking "dismemberment case."

The problem with society lies in "familiarity"!

If the production of gold were also as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, then the name of gold would definitely be set as "yellow sand."

It is not advisable to read too many books, and it is not advisable to understand too much about worldly affairs. Otherwise, you will feel that everything is "unreasonable." Even enthusiastic and impassioned articles will feel boring when read.

"The more the cheaper," nothing is outside of this.
