### Air Force Pilot Zhang Escapes from Communist Area and Returns to Taiwan

People in Communist Area Risk Their Lives to Protect Him

[This Newspaper Dispatch from Fuzhou, 1st] It is reported that Air Force 16th Squadron pilot Zhang was protected by people in the Communist area at the risk of their lives and safely returned to the free area and rejoined his unit in Taiwan. Zhang was forced to go to Jinan during a flight to Qingdao by a defector, and later forced to fly a hijacked Civil Aviation plane to Yang. Afterwards, Zhang refused to fly again, and citing the excuse of visiting relatives in his hometown in Ping, claimed illness and stayed there for two months. After fully understanding the hardship and lack of freedom in the lives of the people in Ping, Zhang firmly requested to return south to the Communist authorities. He was sent by train, saying that he could board a ship in Tianjin, but Zhang quickly realized that the Communist army had no good intentions, so he jumped off the train midway and escaped. He hid in the homes of local people for more than ten days, and was then helped by the people, who used silver dollars to buy him a travel permit and disguised him as someone going to Jinan to transfer to Qingdao. It is reported that the Communist army falsely named labor vehicles and assigned grain donations based on the number of pieces of furniture in each household, which the citizens could not afford. They dared to be angry but dared not speak. Even university professors were as timid as crickets. Zhang was deeply grateful for the courage of the people in the Communist area, who risked their lives to help the government Air Force escape despite the Communist army's strict control of the five-household guarantee system. It was no different from the stories of resistance during the Anti-Japanese War, which are happening today in the Communist area.

### Spokesman of the Shanghai-Wusong Garrison Command Analyzes the Military Situation; Communist Army Supply Lines May Be Cut Off at Any Time; Guojun Striving for Initiative

[Central News Agency Dispatch from This City] Zhang Taixiang, spokesman of the Shanghai-Wusong Garrison Command, analyzed the recent military situation at a press conference at 3:00 PM on the 1st. He pointed out that after crossing the river, the Communist army's military offensives are difficult to sustain rapidly, but a major crisis has been laid, that is, their supply lines may be cut off at any time. If they encounter setbacks, their defeat will also be like the Yangtz River's ten thousand li. Zhang said that the victory or defeat of a military operation is not determined by the gain or loss of a city or a place, but by annihilating the opponent's main force. The Guojun is currently striving for the initiative, and its main force is still maintained. Warfare is like gambling, with "waiting," "enduring," and "being ruthless" being the secrets. The Guojun's "waiting" and "enduring" will soon pass, and thereafter, it will seize the opportunity to "be ruthless." Regarding Shanghai, Zhang complained that some people hope that the Communist army will not attack or that the Guojun will not resist when the Communist army attacks, so as to avoid losses, which is ridiculous. The Communist army's slogan includes the phrase "liquidate Shanghai," so they will definitely not relax their grip on Shanghai. The Guojun in Shanghai is determined to defend the city to the death. If the Communist army comes to attack, it will be the time for the Guojun to "be ruthless." Zhang emphasized that the current war is a war of freedom and democracy against violence and terror, so he believes that freedom and democracy will ultimately prevail.

### Chinese Communists Demand That Britain, the United States, and France Withdraw Troops from China; and Claim to Be Willing to Consider Establishing Diplomatic Relations with Various Countries

[Associated Press Dispatch from San Francisco, 30th] The Xinhua Radio Station in Beiping broadcast on the 30th the life of the spokesman of the People's Liberation Army Command, demanding that Britain, the United States, and France quickly withdraw their troops, warships, and military aircraft from China, while allowing the protection of foreign nationals engaged in legitimate professions in China, and willing to consider establishing diplomatic relations with various countries, provided that the governments of each country first sever relations with the National Government. Most of the statement directly rebuked Churchill's proposal that Britain send more warships to Chinese waters and refuted Attlee's statement regarding the shelling of British warships on the Yangtze River. According to the statement, the British naval gunfire caused 252 casualties to the Communist army. The British committed such a great crime in Chinese territory that the People's Liberation Army can demand that the British government admit its mistake, apologize, and compensate. After refuting part of Attlee's statement, the statement continued, the People's Liberation Army does not hope that any country will provide assistance in crossing the river or other actions. On the contrary, the People's Liberation Army demands that Britain, the United States, and France quickly withdraw their armed forces, warships, military aircraft, and marines from the Yangtze River, the Huangpu River, and other locations in China by sea, land, and air, and no longer assist the enemies of the Chinese people in engaging in civil war. Up to now, the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the People's Government have not established diplomatic relations with any foreign government. The Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the People's Government are willing to protect all foreigners engaged in legitimate professions in China, and are willing to consider establishing diplomatic relations with various countries. However, the establishment of this relationship should be based on equality, reciprocity, and mutual respect for each other's independence and territorial integrity. First, all countries should not assist the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the People's Government do not want to be threatened by any action by any government. If the governments of various countries wish to consider establishing diplomatic relations with the Communist government, they must sever relations with the remaining forces of the Kuomintang and withdraw armed forces from China. Attlee said that because the Chinese Communists have not established diplomatic relations with various countries in the past, they are unwilling to have relations with foreign diplomats. This statement is unfounded. The governments of the United States, Britain, and Canada have assisted the Kuomintang against the Communists in the past. Has Attlee forgotten this? Who was it that recently supplied the recently sunk heavy cruiser Chongqing? Britain used a cruiser to subsidize the Kuomintang government, and when the Kuomintang government's plane was about to defect to the Chinese Communists, it bombed and sank it.

### U.S. State Department and Embassy Maintain Contact

[Associated Press Dispatch from Washington, 30th] State Department spokesman McDermott said on the 30th that he was unaware of any situation that would support rumors that Ambassador Stuart in Nanjing was being held under house arrest by the Communist army.

These guards have withdrawn and resumed several times. Although Ambassador Stuart has not left the embassy, three embassy officials left the embassy on the 30th without any trouble." McDermott said that the State Department is still in contact with the embassy and did not mention the arrest of any officials at the embassy.

[Reuters Dispatch from Hong Kong, 1st] The U.S. Navy hospital ship "Haven" sailed into Hong Kong from Shanghai on the morning of the 1st, carrying 77 wounded personnel from the four British ships that were shelled by the Communist army in the Yangtze River. Forty-nine of them were carried ashore on stretchers, and the remaining twenty-seven walked ashore. They were all transferred to the naval hospital here. Personnel on the "Haven" refused to provide any information, and reporters were denied entry to the naval dock where the ship was berthed. Unconfirmed reports say that one of all the war victims on the ship has already died during the journey to Hong Kong. Besides, The "Haven" also carried one hundred and ten US citizens evacuated from Shanghai.

### US Congressional Committees to Meet This Week; Chennault to Testify, Report on Aid to China; Senate Debates China Policy, Hopes for Increased Support

[United Press, Washington, April 30] Chennault, at the invitation of Senators Nolan and McClellan, will appear before the House and Senate Foreign Aid Oversight Committees and the Senate Armed Services Committee next week to present his views on American aid to China. Nolan said that Chennault will report to the Senate Armed Services Committee on the morning of the 3rd on the situation in China and its impact on US national defense.

[Associated Press, Washington, April 30] Hopes for a Senate debate on US China policy have been strengthened by two developments. One is the hint from Democratic Senator McClellan, and the other is the testimony of prominent China experts before two congressional committees this week. McClellan's hint is that he has not denied reports that some Democrats and Republicans are jointly pressing for an investigation into the government's China policy and forcing the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to submit the McClellan Aid to China Bill to the Senate. Testimony on the current situation in China will be presented by Major General Chennault of the Flying Tigers to the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Joint Congressional Oversight Committee. According to Senate Minority Leader Hurlburt and senior Republican Bridges of the Appropriations Committee, they met with President Truman and Secretary of State Acheson at the White House on the 28th to discuss the situation in China. The two Republicans said after the meeting that they had learned some previously unknown facts, but both called for a "comprehensive review" of China policy.

[Associated Press, Cleveland, April 30] Progressive Party leader Henry Wallace said on the 30th that the current situation in China "never needed to happen." Wallace said, "What is happening in China is an example of what could happen elsewhere. A proper agreement between Washington and Moscow could prevent military activity in China."

### The Mystery of Xikang

— Our Reporter, Zhou Xueduan

Disputes, Liu Wenhui trapped in Ya'an, at a loss. Xikang, where Han and Yi peoples coexist, is a difficult place, with stubborn and precious people, hidden fortunes, and inexhaustible resources, is our country's most promising natural treasure. The governance and chaos of Kang are attracting national attention. Here, the reporter provides an objective report on the inside story of the Kang unrest.

True Picture of the Ya'an Unrest: Armed Fights and Resistance to Suppression

The Xikang unrest has spread to the Ya'an and Ning districts. The Ya'an district includes the areas of Rongjing, Tianquan, and Lushan. The cause is armed fights and "resistance to suppression." The Ning unrest is the conflict between Deng (Deliang) and Sun (Fang). The Ya'an district armed fights involve Rongjing and Tianquan. The "Rongjing Incident" is due to uneven quality and conflicting powers between Tian Wei, the Speaker of the County Assembly, and Chen Bochang, the Deputy Speaker. The two sides mobilized tens of thousands of henchmen and engaged in fierce battles. The "Tianquan Incident" is a large-scale armed fight among the four major clans of Xun, Zhou, Shu, and Gong in the area due to competition for local power. The expansion of the two major armed fights has caused local chaos. The Tianquan and Rongjing areas have been in a state of terror for the past six months. The "resistance to suppression" is the most complex and largest in scale. It has been brewing for several months. Currently, there are over 30,000 people claiming to be the "People's Self-Defense Army," composed of members of the Gelaohui, bandits, and some "Kenshe" personnel from the Sichuan-Kang border. The leaders are Li Yuanning, Li Xianchun, Zhu Shizheng, Chen Zhiwu, Gao Ronglian, etc., who were involved in the previous "Ya'an District Incident," and their momentum is huge. Liu Wenhui rushed back to Ya'an from Chengdu to take charge. The rebel army advanced in three routes from Tianquan, Zheshan, and Rongjing to join forces. The war once spread to Feixian Pass, south of Ya'an City. This is the heart of Xikang's troubles today, and the war is still ongoing.

Expansion of the Unrest: Complex Reasons

The origins of the Ya'an District Incident are long and complex. From the first Ya'an unrest in 1946 to today, dark currents have been brewing in Kang, and there has never been a day of stability. The crux of the matter is "resistance to suppression." Originally, opium cultivation in Xikang was due to barren land and poverty. Liu Wenhui's governance of Kang for over a decade relied entirely on "public opium" to make up for the lack of military and financial resources. Cunning people took advantage of this to engage in wrongdoing and illegal profiteering. Mountainous border residents exchanged opium for food and various materials from outside, resulting in widespread opium addiction in Xikang. Talking about banning opium is truly deeply rooted and difficult to eradicate. At the same time, all real power in the Ya'an district was in the hands of Liu Wenhui's nephew, Liu Yuancong, who was a well-known "three generals" type: crude, greedy, and insatiable. The army specialized in protecting opium cultivation and trafficking, and competed with local tycoons for power and profit, leading to long-standing animosity. The last Ya'an District Incident was caused by this chaos. After the unrest was quelled, a "post-incident review meeting" was held in Ya'an, and local people demanded that Liu Wenhui be determined to ban opium, but first, protecting opium cultivation and trafficking meant protecting powerful figures, and second, enforcing the ban inevitably led to favoritism and corruption, leading to "resistance to suppression" and then "unrest." The authorities failed to use political means to guide the situation, turning it into the politically charged "Ya'an unrest" of today.

Ning District Unrest: Deng-Sun Conflict

The Ning District Incident is the conflict between Deng (Deliang), the commander of the Jingbian, and Sun (Fang). This is a border legend with a strong feudal consciousness. Deng is the eldest son of Deng Xiuting, the former "King of Southern Kang," and Sun is an old subordinate of Deng Xiuting. Deng Xiuting was an extraordinary figure among the Yi people of Ning. Because he had always leaned towards the government, had a clear mind, and was progressive in his thinking, he had great authority among the Yi people. The government relied heavily on his power to handle Yi affairs in the border area [using Yi to govern Yi]. When Liu Wenhua governed Kang, he appointed him as the Jingbian commander, and Zhang Qianlun, the director of the Xichang Xingyuan, forged a bond with him by marrying their children. His subordinates possessed four to five thousand elite Yi soldiers. After Deng Xiuting's death, his forces were divided into two factions: one faction, headed by Sun Fang, the deputy commander of the border, and the other faction, supporting Deng Deliang to succeed him. The actual power was in the hands of Deng's mother. At that time, the government, remembering Deng Xiuting's twenty years of hard work in securing the border, retained all of his troops and handed them over to Sun Fang for full command. In addition, He Guoguang, the commander of the Xichang Garrison, recommended Deng Deliang to the central government for training. Deng's mother requested that her son be appointed to succeed Deng Xiuting's position, but this was not approved. After Deng Huaye returned to Kang, the central government appointed him as the Jingbian deputy commander and Jingbian regiment commander, but Deng's mother again firmly requested that Deng be the commander and have full command of the troops. To maintain its authority, the central government again refused and welcomed Sun to Chang from the Xichang Garrison to take office. Deng refused to accept the new order, and the two sides had a conflict over power.

Lexi Highway: Bloody Battles for Over Ten Days

The conflict between Deng and Sun intensified. The Kang provincial authorities and local figures tried to mediate to eliminate the possibility of war, but to no avail. Deng Deliang set up his own command headquarters, appointed regimental commanders and other officers, and mobilized heavy troops to gather in Luguhu, with Xiaomiao, Lizhou, Yichen, and Songlin as defense lines. Deng took office in Luguhu on his own and issued proclamations, and the situation became increasingly escalated. He Guoguang returned to Chang from Chongqing for this purpose and convened an expanded meeting of key figures from all parties in Ning to discuss solutions. The meeting unanimously advocated that, in order to maintain local order and safeguard national discipline, the principle of peaceful and generous compromise should be adopted to end the conflict. He Guoguang and Zhang Qianlun again used public and private relations to send representatives to persuade both sides, but no agreement was reached due to the great disparity of interests, and they went to war. Deng Deliang's troops mobilized three regiments of the Jingbian, plus the Han troops of Deng Yukai, Deng Yujun, Deng Yuhua, and Luo Keqing, totaling over 1,500 men, and over ten tribes of Yi soldiers, including Changjia Wujiao, Luomu Ga, and Zhuzhi Qi, totaling 5,600 guns. Sun Fang's troops mobilized five battalions of the Jingbian, plus over ten tribes of Yi soldiers, including Nazhi Dayu, with numbers comparable to Deng's troops. The two sides engaged in bloody battles along the Lexi Highway for over ten days, and the war is still continuing.

Xikang - a mysterious West. Solving the mystery of this spiritual region, in today's era of widespread conflict, is difficult to thoroughly clarify.

### Editorial: Talking About Evacuating the Population

Since the breakdown of peace talks and the successive crossing of the Yangtze River by the Communist army, and the withdrawal of the National army from Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Suzhou, the general public in Shanghai has directly felt that the flames of war are imminent. As a result, people's hearts are agitated, the streets and alleys are filled with wartime scenes, and social order, finance, and the economy have also fluctuated and fallen into chaos. This phenomenon not only directly hinders local security but also affects people's hearts. Therefore, we feel that the recent evacuation of the population and stabilization of society by the municipal military government is an urgent measure that requires the close cooperation of all citizens of the city.

Since the end of last month, the municipal military and political authorities have decided to thoroughly evacuate the city's population, stipulating that the entry of people from other areas be restricted, and forcibly evacuating citizens without national identification cards. They are also conducting surprise inspections at any time and place, and stipulating that water and land transportation should be used as much as possible, and the transportation of furniture is strictly prohibited to facilitate the evacuation of citizens. According to the population density of the city, it has been rising in a straight line towards the saturation point for the past three years. According to the general census of the city's population in October last year, the total population of the city was 5,448,466, the number of unemployed often accounted for more than 30%, and there were often 200,000 to 300,000 refugees, who often needed relief. In the past four months, refugees from various counties along the Yangtze River in northern Jiangsu, as well as along the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, have poured into the city, and the population has surged, already exceeding six million. And relief work is difficult to carry out, so evacuating the population is a pressing need.

However, when it comes to evacuating the population, a shocking picture of exile appears before our eyes. The old and weak are left in ditches, and the strong are scattered in all directions. Many docile people inevitably fall into the tragic situation of wives and children being separated and families being destroyed. As the saying goes, "Heaven and earth are not benevolent, and treat all things as straw dogs." Past experiences of exile during wars tell us that the most important thing in evacuation work is the allocation of transportation and the maintenance of traffic order, all of which must have a comprehensive plan. Not only should the black market for boat tickets and train tickets be completely eliminated, but also preferential measures should be formulated to facilitate citizens' purchase of tickets. However, just as the Shanghai Municipal Population Census and Evacuation Joint Executive Office was established, and the notice to citizens on the evacuation of the population was published, the prices of train and plane tickets were all changed to silver dollar pricing, which undoubtedly adds a strong obstacle to the evacuation of the population. We know that citizens with a strong economic foundation in the city left for Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Taiwan as early as three months ago, and as late as last week. Today, those who are forced to evacuate are mostly petty people who are unable to escape, or refugees who have just arrived in Shanghai and have not yet gained a foothold. How can they have the means to purchase plane, ship, or train tickets? And how will they live after evacuating? These are all things that the wise military and political authorities should consider for the people.

I remember that during the Anti-Japanese War, before the fall of Guilin, there was an emergency evacuation, from Liuzhou to Yishan, Hechi, and refugees were endless on the road, without any complaints. The central government was able to send senior officials to Duyun, Dushan, Jinchengjiang, and other places in time to provide emergency relief, rescue refugees, and invite people from the cultural community to Guizhou to transfer to Chongqing. At that time, the troops of Commander-in-Chief Tang happened to be ordered to go to the front line of Guizhou to provide support; and Gu Zhenggang, who recently took office as the Political Affairs Commissioner of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, personally went to the front line in his capacity as Minister of Social Affairs that day, and comforted the people amidst the gunfire and bullets. Coincidentally, Tang and Gu are both in this city today, shouldering the military and political tasks of defending Greater Shanghai. With their support and the support of the municipal authorities, we believe that the evacuation work will definitely be easy and smooth, and everything will be well-organized. We will definitely protect the suffering people from disaster and danger, and all disasters can be turned into safety. But we still want to put forward a few suggestions for the authorities to consider.

First, transportation should be requisitioned and applied as much as possible, centrally supplied and allocated, evacuation trains should be added, evacuation ships should be dispatched, and outbound citizens should be given special treatment. The silver dollar pricing method should be abolished first, and it is best to provide large-scale free transportation.

Second, living conditions during the journey should be maintained, and safety during the journey should be guaranteed to the best of our ability. In particular, the inspection of ships and vehicles must be strictly enforced. The bloody tragedy of the Jiangya and Taiping shipwrecks is still fresh in our minds, and capsizing and other situations also occur from time to time. The lives of displaced refugees are already miserable enough, and they must not encounter unexpected dangers again.

Third, the outbound population should be planned and settled. The authorities should urgently designate evacuation areas, consult with the local leaders and local people to properly settle the incoming population. Don't send them out of Shanghai and then ignore them, letting them wander around the world; or use your neighbor as a ditch, which will only increase the number of refugees in that area.

In short, in the current dangerous environment, evacuating the population is indeed an urgent task; but the people of Shanghai have repeatedly experienced war and suffered greatly. Now that the flames of war have reached the doorstep, the weight and pain of their hearts is self-evident. The military and political authorities should especially show compassion and must not deepen the suffering of the people by evacuating the population!

### Jessup Reports to Acheson on Results of Talks with Soviet Union; England and France to Participate in Next Meeting

[United Press, New York, April 30] Well-informed sources recently stated that US representative Jessup and Deputy Foreign Minister Malik have met twice this week to discuss the conditions for lifting the Berlin blockade and have made progress. The scope of negotiations will soon be expanded to include British representative Cadogan and French representative Chauvel. This kind of negotiation will in fact be a preliminary step towards a four-country foreign ministers' meeting. The representatives will also arrange the procedures and date for the four foreign ministers' meeting. The Soviet Union, England, and France seem to have agreed that the foreign ministers' meeting should be held in Paris in late May. There will be no new developments in the discussion of the issue within days. Jessup has gone to Washington to report face-to-face to Secretary of State Acheson on the results of his talks with the Soviet representative.

[Reuters, Paris, April 30] Reliable sources here said that after the Berlin blockade is lifted, a four-power meeting can be convened on May 15. The French Foreign Ministry, after receiving a phone report from its representative to the United Nations, Chauvel, is convinced that the lifting of the Berlin blockade is only a matter of days.

[Reuters, Berlin, April 30] People close to the Soviet military government revealed that the Soviet intelligence chief Tubanov predicted today that the Berlin blockade, which has lasted for ten months, will be lifted within 72 hours. However, a British military spokesman said that he was not aware of this. Tubanov told the editor of the Soviet district newspaper this afternoon that the main issues related to traffic restrictions between Berlin and West Germany have been resolved by the four powers, and the lifting of the blockade is expected to begin within the next three days, and a foreign ministers' meeting can be convened soon.

[Reuters, London, May 1] London officials have taken a reserved attitude towards the news from Berlin that the Berlin blockade will be lifted soon. It is believed here that the three military governors of West Germany, England, the United States, and France are still waiting for new instructions from the three governments after receiving a report on the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on the Berlin issue. The technical issues regarding the removal of the blockade are still to be discussed further in New York or Berlin.

[United Press, New York, April 30] The President of the United Nations General Assembly, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, made a statement today, predicting that the Berlin blockade can be lifted soon. It is said that there are now various reasons to believe that the Berlin dispute can be ended and the blockade can be lifted as soon as possible. The resolution of this matter is a great delight to the United Nations organization because international peace and justice have been advanced one step. The resolution of the Berlin issue does not mean the resolution of the entire dispute between the great powers, but other issues have also gained new contact. This is not only the case with the German issue, but also with the Far East issue.

### West Germany Deploys to Restore Berlin Land Transportation; Waiting for Soviet Action; Soviet Attitude Towards Opening Shipping in the British Zone is More Moderate Than Before

[United Press, Berlin, April 30] West Germany has arranged the final plan for restoring Berlin's land transportation tonight, hoping that Moscow will issue an order to lift the Berlin blockade on May 1st Labor Day. According to news from Hamburg, West German railways are preparing to run 30 trains to Berlin in one day, including 20 coal trains.

Optimism here is strong after the Soviet authorities in Berlin responded favorably to two British requests yesterday, believing that the Soviet attitude seems to have completely changed. The Soviet side allowed that they will no longer interfere with canal traffic in the British sector of Berlin and apologized for the arrest of three British military police officers by the People's Police in the British-Soviet border area.

[Associated Press, Berlin, April 30] The Soviet and British sides agreed on the 30th to completely free navigation in the canals in the western part of Berlin. This is the first important agreement between Eastern and Western countries since the Soviet Union began blockading Berlin last June. Soviet Transportation Director Major General Krashning and British Deputy Commander of the Berlin Occupying Forces Beson agreed at the meeting that ships registered with both the Soviet and British sides would be free to navigate in the canals in the western part of the city. The negotiations were initiated by Krashning and held at the headquarters of the Soviet occupying forces.

[Reuters, Berlin, April 30] The three British military police officers who were arrested by the Soviet side at the Memel Airport in the British sector yesterday have been released today after British protests. The three military police officers were ordered to investigate the incident of the Soviet police invading the British area and forcibly confiscating livestock, and the Soviet side believed that they had mistakenly entered the Soviet border. However, according to a British spokesman, they did not step into the Soviet border.

### Doolittle Advocates Avoiding War with the Soviet Union; Otherwise, Atomic Bombs Should Be Dropped in a Timely Manner

[Associated Press, Washington, May 1] Retired Air Force Lieutenant General Doolittle, who led the first air raid on Tokyo seven years ago, said here in Georgetown on the 1st that the United States must make efforts to avoid war with the Soviet Union, but if signs of aggression appear, it must be prepared to drop atomic bombs at the first sign of aggression. He said that in the near future, war with the Soviet Union can be avoided if the United States remains strong, but permanent peace requires the combination of American military power, domestic and foreign education, and the revival of the world spirit.

### England Welcomes Greece to Participate in the European Conference

[Agence France-Presse, London, April 30] Well-informed sources said that Britain will welcome Greece and Turkey to participate in the European Conference. According to this, the conference, which will be convened here on May 3, will also make final revisions to the draft on the status of the European Parliament drafted by representatives of various countries here.

### The Netherlands Controls Only Cities and Roads in Indonesia; The Binnie Committee Submits a Report

[Reuters, Lake Success, April 30] The United Nations Indonesia Commission today released a report on the military situation in Indonesia, which concluded that in most of the areas administered by the former Indonesian Republic, the Dutch army only controlled the main cities and roads. In the areas of East Java that were controlled by the Dutch army before December 15, 1948, there was also a concentration of Indonesian Republican troops. Conflicts occurred from time to time in Java and Sumatra. Although there were many conflicts in the past two months, most of them were small-scale, with no more than two hundred people on each side each time. Only in the attack on Yogyakarta by the Republican army did the Indonesian side dispatch 1,500 people. In addition to the regular army of the Republic, there are also various guerrilla forces active in Indonesia. The United Nations Commission believes that unless a comprehensive political solution is reached, the economy cannot be restored, order cannot be restored, and the suffering of the people cannot be alleviated.

### To Resolve the Dutch-Indonesian Dispute, the United States Proposes a New Plan, Advocating that Indonesia Participate in the Hague Conference

[United Press, Batavia, April 30] Dutch and Indonesian Republican leaders today studied a new solution to resolve the Dutch-Indonesian dispute. The case was informally proposed by American representative Kochran of the United Nations Mediation Team, advocating that before the Indonesian Republic is restored in Yogyakarta, Rom, the chairman of the Indonesian delegation, should be authorized by other Republican leaders to declare: (1) Approve the ceasefire order; (2) Firmly maintain that the Indonesian government should participate in the Hague Round Table Conference.

### Hungary and Bulgaria Abuse Clergy; Submitted to United Nations Countries to Stop; United Nations General Assembly Passes Resolution

[Agence France-Presse, Flushing, April 30] The United Nations General Assembly tonight passed a resolution discussed by the Special Political Committee on the cases of Archbishop Stepinac and Bulgarian clergy, stipulating that all countries that have signed peace treaties with Hungary and Bulgaria are invited to take joint action in accordance with the provisions of the treaties to stop the destruction of democratic freedom by the two countries. Thirty-four countries voted in favor of this motion, six Slavic countries voted against, and nine countries, including Afghanistan, Burma, India, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen, abstained. The General Assembly has decided to place the two cases on the agenda of the next meeting.

### Suspects in Plot to Assassinate the King of Iran; Two Sentenced to Death; 200 of 300 Arrested Have Been Released

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, April 30] The official statement here stated that of the nine people accused of participating in the plot to assassinate the King of Iran, two have been sentenced to death today, and it is said that the rest have been sentenced to terms ranging from six months imprisonment to life imprisonment. Iranian Prime Minister Said said in Congress today that of the 300 suspects arrested after the assassination of the King of Iran, 200 have been released.

### The United States Does Not Intend to Invite Spain to Participate in the Atlantic Treaty; The Senate Foreign Relations Committee May Pass It Next Week

[United Press, Washington, April 30] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally said today that the committee will conclude the debate on the North Atlantic Security Treaty next week, and will pass it straight away.

[Reuters, Washington, April 30] Observers here pointed out that Spain is currently unlikely to join the Atlantic Treaty, because the participation of Spain is unlikely to gain the support of two-thirds of the senators in the United States Senate. President Truman believes that any new treaty must be passed by two-thirds of the Senate before it can be established, and Spain's joining the Atlantic Treaty should also pass this procedure. Secretary of State Acheson said to Vandenberg during an inquiry in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he was instructed by the President to declare that any new country joining the Atlantic Treaty is actually equivalent to the United States signing a new treaty with that country, so according to the Constitution, the President hopes to request the approval of the Senate before he personally expresses his consent. When asked why Portugal was able to join the Atlantic Treaty, Acheson replied that this was the opinion of the signatory countries of the treaty, and inviting Portugal to participate was a unanimous decision of the founding countries, and they had not decided to invite Spain to participate. It is known that there are not a few senators in the House and Senate who advocate inviting Spain to join the Atlantic Treaty, and Catholics are particularly vocal about this.

### Lower House of Canada Approves Atlantic Pact

[Agence France-Presse, Ottawa, 30th] The Canadian Lower House today unanimously approved the Atlantic Pact by a vote of 185 to 0. During a brief debate before the vote, the Canadian Prime Minister stated that he hoped the same convention would be signed in the short term, including the Soviet Union and all countries that signed the United Nations Charter at the San Francisco Conference.

### Wallace Criticizes Atlantic Pact, Demands US-Soviet Peace Plan

[United Press, Cleveland, 1st] Wallace denounced the "Vandenberg Cold War" and the "Truman Doctrine" on the evening of the 30th. He stated: The Atlantic Pact they support is doomed to fail. Wallace told the audience at the local music academy: "The path to peace is definitely not the Atlantic Pact." He said, "The Atlantic Pact will make Europe a second China." He called on the United States and the Soviet Union to build a truly strong United Nations so that both sides could begin planning for peace, not war, after regaining their conscience. This was Wallace's third major speech during his nationwide tour calling for the rejection of the Atlantic Pact.

### Turkey Reluctant to Join Atlantic Pact, Mediterranean Pact Formation Temporarily Impossible

[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 30th] Turkish Prime Minister Gubanerdan stated while receiving reporters today, issuing a statement on his country's foreign policy: "Turkey has never been eager to join the Atlantic Pact. I believe that the establishment of a Mediterranean Pact is still impossible at present. If we do not participate in a convention that would increase our burden, it would be more beneficial to our position."

### Philippine Farmers' Army Denies Assassinating Mrs. Quezon

[United Press, Manila, 30th] Taruc, leader of the Farmers' Army Communist Party, denied today that his subordinates had planned to assassinate Mrs. Quezon. Taruc issued a statement to Manila newspapers from his secret headquarters on Luzon Island, stating, "We have never issued any order to harm Mrs. Quezon or her family. An investigation is currently underway, and if any negligence or violation of Farmers' Army discipline is found, the perpetrators will be severely punished." Meanwhile, government forces are still continuing their offensive in central Luzon against Farmers' Army Commander Venus, who instigated the tragedy.

### Burmese Government Committee Recommends to President to Temporarily Postpone General Election; Government Forces to Launch General Offensive in Upper Burma

[United Press, Rangoon, 30th] Authoritative sources reported today that the Burmese Government's Commission of Seven-Eight, due to national unrest caused by the civil war, has recommended to the President to postpone the general election. According to the Burmese Constitution, the general election should be held within eighteen months of independence, i.e., around July 4 of this year. In other news, according to a government gazette announcement, a general offensive is about to be launched against the military in Upper Burma. Government forces drove straight down from Meiktila, eighty miles southwest of Mandalay, and have occupied Toungoo, where the Karen military headquarters of the Sittaung River in central Burma is located. When government forces advanced into another city 150 miles from Rangoon, the city was almost completely deserted. It is reported that most Karen people went to the Taikkyi area to participate in the offensive against Rangoon, leaving their rear exposed, which was taken advantage of by government forces.

### Moscow Commemorates May Day Labor Day, Grand Military Parade Held in Red Square

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 1st] Moscow commemorated May Day Labor Day today with a grand military parade before Marshal Stalin. Several military units concentrated in Red Square and were inspected by Vasilyevsky, Minister of Armed Forces, accompanied by Meretskov, Moscow Garrison Commander. Fighter planes and bombers, led by three new-style jet fighters, flew low over the two men. As the troops marched past Stalin, who stood on the reviewing stand, they raised their hands in salute. Surrounding him were Deputy Prime Ministers Molotov, Malenkov, and Marshal Bulganin, among others. As workers carrying portraits of the Stakhanovite movement, Soviet student heroes, and heroes of the Great Patriotic War marched before their leaders, following tanks, artillery, and mechanized cavalry regiments, tens of thousands of spectators shouted slogans of "Long live Stalin" and "Long live the Red Army and Communism," drowning out the sound of the military band. In his speech, Vasilyevsky denounced the aggressive political stance of the United States toward the Soviet Union and Eastern European democracies, calling on workers around the world to unite and defend peace. Similar military parades were also held in major Soviet cities such as Leningrad, Kyiv, and Sevastopol. In the aforementioned cities, thousands of enthusiastic spectators cheered for the Soviet Navy.

### Ingrid Bergman Rumored to Have Romance in Italy; Bergman's Husband Suddenly Flies from New York to Italy

[United Press, Rome, 30th] Hollywood Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman's husband, Lindstrom, arrived here from New York by plane on the 30th. It is rumored here that Ingrid Bergman and famous Italian director Roberto Rossellini are having a romance. Lindstrom told reporters at the Rome airport: "I will go to a hotel in Rome." However, Lindstrom did not appear at the hotel. It is generally believed that Lindstrom may go directly to Naples to take a small boat to the island of Stromboli, where Ingrid and Roberto are filming.

### London Aglow with Lights and Flowers

— Yingzhi

[Special Dispatch from London] On the eve of the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty, London, which has been dim for almost ten years, is once again brightly lit, allowing torches of various colors to illuminate the night. Although "the flower market is as brightly lit as before," other situations are completely different. This once world-renowned international political capital has moved from Downing Street to the White House. This economic hub that once controlled global wealth has moved from the Bank of London to Wall Street in New York. The once magnificent Bank of England is like a desperate royal descendant, shamelessly borrowing from its former "partners."

The Labor Party, in order to compete in the upcoming election and maintain its power, must please its voters. So, the day before the election in the Hammer Smith district of southwest London in late February, it announced that clothing was no longer rationed. Housewives, after buying a large number of tablecloths and tea towels, naturally thought of their roots and voted for the Labor Party, resulting in the Labor Party winning by a majority of 1,613 votes. Then, eggs were no longer rationed (although the author still only gets three eggs, not big or small, per week, and has not received an extra "mixed" egg), milk could be freely purchased, and the supply of sweets was no longer restricted (but the amount of meat was reduced to only eating shredded fried pork once a week - a British magazine attributed the reduction in meat to Argentine dictator Mrs. Perón, saying that the Argentine president's wife, Mrs. Perón, is the country's MADAME POMPADOUR. When she visited Britain last year, because Buckingham Palace did not invite her to a banquet, she angrily stopped supplying Britain with meat). Everything made people feel that World War II has slowly become a historical relic, and the trauma of war has gradually enveloped people's hearts. How long can this light, which was bought with blood and tears, last?

The author lives in the northern suburbs of London. Last night, eager to mail a letter to a friend vacationing in the Czech Republic, I took the subway into the city to mail the letter and took the opportunity to see the new London lights in the center of London. In Leicester Square, the cinemas are lined up next to each other, and the doors are shining brightly. Indeed, the streetwalkers under the colorful neon lights look much more radiant than before. - Their eyes are bright and their teeth are white, and they are younger. Further ahead is the famous Piccadilly Circus. Hey! The people watching the night view are packed to the rafters. Some are still supporting the old and carrying the young, standing on the street staring wide-eyed at the long-lost lights. The elderly may be recalling the glory of the British Empire in the past. The young have been born into hardship and have never seen these "city opening all night" wonders. The most eye-catching is the Bovril beef broth advertisement, designed as a kaleidoscope, with a burst of "fireworks" scattering countless colorful "sparks." Continuing along Regent Street, many shop windows are shining brightly. The most sophisticated department store, AUSTIN REED, did not install neon lights but bathed the entire building in soft yellow light. There is also the Ford Motor Company's window, which uses light blue lights to illuminate the shiny cars (British cars have also changed from the most conservative styles to streamlined ones. The purpose is to cater to the preferences of Americans - everything follows the lead of the United States, because they have money. What Britain needs is money!). Turning left again is Oxford Street, where all the shops sell women's fashion. Novel hats, colorful gloves, and the NEW LOOK spring clothes and evening dresses. But the shop owners are competing fiercely to attract customers who are rich merchants, and only they can casually buy a car, go to AUSTIN REED to dress themselves as a typical gentleman, and only those noble ladies can order those new spring evening dresses and ask their "gentlemen" to buy a new coat or a string of pearl necklaces!

### Turbulent Situation in Fujian

— Our Correspondent Pu Dejie

Bandits Everywhere

[Special Dispatch from Fuzhou and Hangzhou, 28th] The "security" problem, in Fujian and in any other rear province, is the most thorny issue. After General Zhu Shaoliang, director of the Fuzhou Pacification Headquarters and concurrently chairman of the province, took office, he first resolved to rectify the security work. He also admitted: "In the past six months, the security situation in this province has continued to expand due to external influences, causing many disturbances in various places." These many disturbances are manifested in the phenomenon of bandits everywhere today, and the situation in Fujian is becoming more turbulent.

Bandits, or "local communists," are active throughout the province, from Fuding, where northern Fujian borders Zhejiang, to Changting, where the west borders Jiangxi, to Yongding, where the south borders Guangdong, to Shaxian and Yongan in the interior, and Huangtian and Fuqing on the coast, and even Linsen County, which is located around the provincial capital of Fuzhou, reports are often heard. The police and security authorities are exhausted, and the local self-defense national teams are even more difficult to defend against. The failure of provincial administration to get on track in the past six months has made this security issue the most urgent task at present. Small groups of scattered bandits have become strong armed forces, and grass-roots bandits and pirates have become stained with political colors. This problem has suddenly become not simple.

The Liu Yongsheng gang in the Fujian-Guangdong border area is naturally the most noteworthy. The appointment of Yu Yingqi as the commander-in-chief of the bandit suppression in the Fujian-Guangdong border area does not require any explanation. The main force of the Liu gang is mostly active in Guangdong Province, and there are also two detachments in southern Fujian and western Fujian. They often attack townships in Zhangpu, Zhao'an, Yunxiao, Dongshan, Nanjing, Chengpu, Yongding, Shanghang, Longyan and other counties, robbing weapons and ammunition depots, and ambushing teams. According to official reports, the southern Fujian detachment, led by Li Zhongxian, has more than 500 men, and the western Fujian detachment, led by Jiang Heyan, has more than 200 men. However, the results of the bandit suppression last year were: 383 bandits killed, 319 bandits injured, 306 bandits captured, 258 bandits who turned themselves in, and 450 long and short guns and one submachine gun seized. The losses of the security regiment were: 18 soldiers killed in action, 1 officer and 22 soldiers wounded, 2 light machine guns, and more than 10 rifles. Moreover, they are "still in the process of searching and suppressing." It seems that the more this gang of bandits is suppressed, the more they increase. On February 22 of this year, more than 300 men from a part of the Liu gang attacked Kanshi Town in Yongding County, robbing more than 70,000 catties of taxes and distributing them to the poor. Until recently, on April 8, another group of more than 700 men disturbed Yanshi Town in Shanghang County, and fled to Guangdong after being besieged by the security team. This gang of bandits should be called "local communists," because according to official reports, their organization includes political commissars, women's teams, people's alliance groups, and so on.

In northern Fujian, it is rumored that there is an organization called "Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi Border Area People's Guerrilla Column," but in fact, the activities of the bandits are scattered. Fuding County and Xiapu County in the northeast corner are often harassed by the Zheng Zhou Danfu gang of bandits from southern Zhejiang. At the end of March, Huotong Town in Ningde County was attacked and plundered, and the county seat of Fujian was almost captured. The border between Zhenghe County and Qingyuan County in Zhejiang Province is the den of the Chen Gulao gang of bandits. As for Jian'ou, Nanping, and Gutian, they are the domain of the Zuo Timei gang, while the border between Mingxi, Jiangle, and Taining has the Luo Jiangbo and Chen Xiangsheng gangs singing the slogan "Supporting the Communist Party" and killing and setting fires. These gangs of bandits range from sixty or seventy to two or three hundred men, and do not necessarily have political awareness, so they often engage in highway robbery. In January, the Nanping Jin'ou section of the highway bridge was burned, and because of the "still lingering bandit atmosphere," it has not been fully repaired to this day. In mid-March, the "Qinghai" steamship of the Minjiang Shipping Company was intercepted by more than 100 bandits carrying three light machine guns near Gugou between Fuzhou and Nanping. On April 6, the Min-Zhe-Gan intermodal bus of the First Transportation Office of the Highway Administration was also robbed by bandits near Yushan Street between Jian'ou and Gutian. However, the Luo Chen gang was defeated by the security regiment at the end of March.

Changting in western Fujian was once part of the so-called "Ruijin People's Soviet Regime" of the Chinese Communist Party during the period of communist suppression before the war. Although its colors were diluted a bit as an important city in the interior of Fujian during the Anti-Japanese War, its social instability is inevitable. The gangs of bandits now active in western Fujian and the hinterland mostly originate from Changting, Liancheng, and other counties. Yongan, Mingxi, Shaxian, and Datian are actually their free territory. In the provincial capital, there are many news reports about bandit disasters in this area. The famous Liu gang suffered a great loss last year, and has not been very active this year. However, from the mouths of visitors, it can also be known that the situation is not truly peaceful. The "local communists" are expanding in the hinterland. They live in village A for a period of time, recuperate and replenish, promote resistance to taxation, and then go to village B to carry out activities, borrowing a batch of supplies from village B. In addition to returning what was borrowed from village A, they can also provide food for their use in village B. By analogy, they finally open a field tax granary somewhere. It can be seen that the mountain area is burying future hidden worries.

The coastal area has been the area with the most bandit disasters in recent months. Huangtian, Xianyou, Fuqing, and Changle are almost all impure lands. Especially Huangtian, in early March, the Oujiang Town Office and the Gaomiao Township Office were attacked and robbed by bandits one after another, and all the self-defense teams were disarmed. In mid-March, the transportation of field tax grains from Huangshi, Youyang, and Hutian towns and townships was opened by bandits, and tens of millions of rioters were robbed. The traffic safety on the Fuxia Highway is not guaranteed. On average, passenger and cargo vehicles are intercepted once every ten days. The anti-taxation movement in Xianyou and Putian counties is in full swing. In mid-March, beacon fires were everywhere on the mountains near Fengting Town, and all government facilities were locked in the city. After Zhu, who is also the chairman of the province, inspected Quanzhou from Xiamen, he also believed that the problem in the coastal area was precisely the necessary transportation route between Fuzhou and Xiamen. Gucang in Pinghua Township in Fuqing was robbed twice by rioters in mid-March. On March 21, more than 100 armed people once wanted to capture the county seat. Yuxi Town along the highway was lost on the 28th, and all the police were disarmed. Gucang was looted, and the bandits even killed and looted for a day and a night before leaving. The township offices in Changle County were attacked and robbed one after another in mid-March. The bandits collected guns, robbed warehouses, and incited resistance to taxation, which became a set formula. Even the sea is not peaceful. In early April, a large number of sea bandits arrived on Donghai Island off the coast of Lianjiang, wreaking havoc on fishermen, and the pirates on the sea near Nanri Island off the coast of Changle even robbed customs patrol boats and merchant ships.

Fuzhou is surrounded by Linsen County, which should be the area with the best security, but in mid-March, bandit alarms occurred successively in Baisha, Huxing, and other towns, attacking and seizing the guns of the self-defense team. The bandits in central Fujian seem to be scattered in organization, but they have a consistent approach in action, which is the set formula mentioned above: collecting guns, robbing warehouses, and inciting resistance to taxation.

As early as March 12, Zhu, who is also the chairman of the province, pointed out in his report to the Provincial Council that in the many disturbances that have occurred in various places, "the most noteworthy are the Liu Yongsheng and other gangs that are constantly disturbing the territory in the Fujian-Guangdong border area, threatening the peace and order of eight or nine counties in southwestern Fujian; and the scattered bandits in northern Fujian, who have rekindled their activities, looting people, robbing grain, and attacking cars and boats, have occurred from time to time. These are all local phenomena, but they should not be allowed to spread." However, unfortunately, in the past month, these "local phenomena" have spread to such an extent that bandits are everywhere in Fujian.

### Amidst the Drums of War, Singing and Dancing Everywhere; Entertainment Venues Are Crowded Again; Tourists Fill the Downtown Area

[Our News] Although the flames of war are approaching the city, the general public, after the initial few days of tension and panic, have become numb. Except for financial chaos and soaring prices, the war atmosphere is not visible in this area. Entertainment venues such as cinemas and dance halls, which were once deserted, have been crowded again since the day before yesterday, fully reflecting the psychology of seeking stimulation and enjoyment at the end of the century. Yesterday was a regular holiday, and the downtown area was even more crowded with tourists, with singing and dancing everywhere. The leisure and prosperity made people wonder if a battle of life and death was taking place dozens of miles away. The general public's concern about the progress of the war is indeed no longer as worried as it was in the first few days. This fact is enough to prove that the public's enthusiasm for inquiring about war news has greatly diminished. The planes of various airlines flying south were unprecedentedly crowded at the beginning of last week. On average, one company had more than a dozen round-trip flights a day, which was not enough to meet the urgent needs of passengers. By the weekend, business had become sluggish. Those who could leave have left, and the five million citizens who remain in Shanghai are waiting for an unknowable future with numb hearts.

### Children's Education Center Moves to the City Center: Economic Constraints, Hoping for Assistance from All Sectors

[Central News Agency report] The Caohejing Children's Education Center in this city has been established for three years and has taken in more than 1,500 disadvantaged children. Recently, due to the inability to purchase food and fuel, and due to the presence of troops, it was moved from Caohejing to this city on the 28th of last month, and temporarily resided in three schools: the Sixteenth District Central National School in the Hongkou Triangle Area, St. Francis Middle School, and Xinlu 师. However, after the center moved to the city, it was unable to maintain its food supply. The center's source of funding used to rely on: (1) donations from international sources, (2) subsidies from the government, (3) donations from people in society, but all of these have encountered problems. According to Center Director Zhou, who spoke to reporters yesterday, the center's more than 1,500 children need 16 石 of rice every day, and fuel and table salt cost about 18 silver dollars. As the person in charge of the thousand children's home, he feels a deep sense of responsibility.

He sincerely hopes that people from all walks of life will share the burden.

Huili fielded Cao Zhiji, Wei Shu, Tian Fuhai, Lu Dinghou, and Bai Baokang. The referees were Zheng Zhifang and Zhu Mingxing.

Hualian scored ten points in one go, taking a 13-point lead at 41-28. Huili called five timeouts, and Bai Baokang, Zhou Ludinghou, and Fuhai made one shot and one penalty. Fu Jinsheng was ejected for his fifth foul, and Wu Chengzhang replaced him. Before long, Wei Shu also "graduated," and Huili was at the end of its rope, unable to reverse the tide. At 49-37, Zhang Liangxiong replaced A Di. Not long after, time ran out, and Hualian defeated Huili 57-46, winning two games in two battles.

### The Dispute in Guiyang Prefecture

— Reporter Liu Mengchi

As a reporter, I will only take a neutral stance to provide an objective summary as follows:

Guiyang City Council

Starting from March 27th, convened the twelfth general meeting. Several councilors, feeling particularly moved, prepared to make good use of this meeting to conduct a comprehensive inquiry into the municipal government. Before the meeting, it seemed that the heads of the municipal government had also received "intelligence" and made thorough preparations. As expected, events erupted one after another shortly after the meeting began. The incident originated on the morning of the 28th after Mayor Zhang Zhixiang delivered a general report on his administration to the council. The councilors continuously questioned him, even raising many difficult issues that could have made it impossible for the mayor to answer. Fortunately, Mayor Zhang was consistently peaceful and sincere in his dealings with people. He answered all inquiries and suggestions patiently and in detail, and frankly expressed his willingness to accept them sincerely. This greatly satisfied the councilors, and they successfully navigated the first hurdle.

In the afternoon of the same day, a second incident erupted in the council hall. Speaker Chen Hu announced: please ask the news reporters and guests to leave the room. They will be temporarily changing the agenda to hold a review meeting. Some councilors, based on the clues from citizens' petitions, had personally gone to the Lost Bridge and Longdongbao stations and found evidence of illegal malfeasance by officials of the Tax Bureau. When handling commercial registrations, the head of the Civil Affairs Section of the municipal government allegedly used his authority. A councilor surnamed Xu saw a subscription order for the "Tianxia Bao" in the municipal government and believed that the person in charge was suspected of forcing merchants and residents to subscribe to the newspaper and illegally selling his position. These two matters had been presented as accusations by the councilors after collecting evidence. They believed that Chen Chaohua, the director of the Tax Bureau, and Zhang Liu Xianzhi of the Civil Affairs Section, were guilty of corruption and selling positions, and should be sent to Mayor Zhang for investigation. At the same time, a document would be prepared to be sent to the Supervision Department of the Guiyang District Court, requesting them to conduct an investigation according to the law.

After the two bombshells were dropped, Deng, the official in charge of commercial registration in the Civil Affairs Section of the municipal government, published a "statement" in the Guizhou Daily the next day. The wording was overly serious. At the same time, he filed a lawsuit in the District Court against Speaker Chen and Councilor Xu. This "statement" added misunderstanding upon misunderstanding for the City Council. That afternoon, all the councilors unanimously decided to ask Mayor Zhang to come to the meeting in a few days to explain the matter.

On the morning of the 31st, the councilors arrived particularly neatly, and the number of news reporters and guests was also higher than at the previous meeting. It was a lively scene, and everyone thought that a good show was about to begin. Mayor Zhang arrived on time and calmly stated that Deng should be personally responsible for the "statement" he published. The two accusations

[Our newspaper's Guiyang dispatch on the 19th] The "dispute between the government and the city council" that has been raging has lasted for three weeks. In this peaceful mountain city, it has stirred up ripples, which have further transformed from the intangible to the tangible, and the rapid flow of the mountain has turned into a vast flood. Both sides seem determined not to give up until they have fully contended with each other. Regarding this matter, opinions vary, and everyone has different perspectives. After the council had twice sent requests to the municipal government for investigation and to the District Court for questioning, it was decided to accept the opinions of the city council and "suspend Chen, Director, and Liu, Section Chief, pending investigation by the court." Unexpectedly, an assembly hall filled with gunpowder was extinguished with just a few words of humility and sincerity from Mayor Zhang. The second hurdle was also cleared.

Incident after incident

Problem after problem. Just when everyone thought there was peace and quiet, they knew that the dispute would be even greater. On the part of the municipal government, it was believed that although Chen and Liu had been accused of corruption and selling positions by the city council and had been asked to the District Court for questioning, the municipal government could only give Chen and Liu administrative sanctions by suspending them pending the court's investigation, which was considered the most respectful response to the public opinion organ. If the court's investigation revealed that Chen and Liu were indeed guilty, they should be dismissed and brought to justice according to the law, which they "could accept." If the court's investigation revealed that Chen and Liu were not guilty enough, then for a good civil servant who was not "every official is corrupt," they should also be protected according to the law and allowed to return to their original positions, so as not to discourage many civil servants who were striving to improve themselves. However, the city council had a different view: they believed that the evidence of corruption was conclusive and beyond doubt. Since the mayor had agreed to suspend them first, the two should resign immediately and not work in the municipal government while awaiting investigation by the court. The municipal government should prepare a document to send them over. Why was there no news for so long, forming a situation of delay? This made it too embarrassing for their public opinion organ. On the contrary, the matter of the municipal government official Deng suing Speaker Chen and Councilor Xu became more serious day by day, which made them even more suspicious. Therefore, the original eight-day session was extended indefinitely to meet every day.

After the council's long extension of the meeting, the two sides turned to a "cold war" phase. The news releases issued by each side seemed to be very reasonable. As a result, more than 200,000 citizens became increasingly confused about the dispute between the government and the council. Speaker Chen had to visit Chairman Gu Zhenglun to explain that the accusation was aimed at the matter and not at the person, and that there was no disagreement between the government and the council. He had to pay close attention to the municipal government's continued measures, and had visited He Chaozong, the secretary-general of the provincial government, and sent a letter to the municipal government to inquire about the progress of its implementation. Soon, the municipal government's reply came, but after the word "suspension," it added a "retention" tail, which made the council think that Mayor Zhang was joking too much, and that he was obviously insincere in fulfilling the promise he had made at the council meeting earlier. However, the municipal government's measures were purely in accordance with the "Civil Servant Appointment Law" and the "Civil Servant Attitude Regulations." They said that before the court announced the results of the investigation, it was necessary to protect councilors whose guilt was not yet determined according to the law. With such a collision, the gap between the government and the council became wider and wider, and the distance became farther and farther.

On the afternoon of April 12, the city council openly hosted gentlemen from all over the city, chairmen of various industries, and news reporters, frankly and completely presenting all the evidence collected, even the newspapers with news about the date, month, and code of relevant bills and publications, to the public, and prepared to indefinitely extend the meeting to protest, expressing that everyone was being messed with. According to Speaker Chen, who revealed shocking news in his office on the 12th, it was rumored that Mayor Zhang was now preparing to risk his official hat to fight him, meaning that either Mayor Zhang would lose his hat, or the council would be dissolved. Speaker Chen said that if Mayor Zhang really risked his official hat to fight him, the council had no position or rank, and the hospitals had no salary to pay, and it was not surprising that the hospitals would not do it. If this were the case, the "government and council as one family," which had always been harmonious, would have to declare divorce.

Seeing that the government and the public opinion organ were arguing, the provincial government had its own set of reasons, and similar things were not only seen in Guiyang City. In order to adapt to the needs, the provincial government announced the news of "Regulations on the Authority and Functions of County and City Governments and Councils," the general idea is in accordance with Guizhou Provincial Government's political

Reform Plan Provisions

The following points are instructed: (1) If the county and city government believes that the resolution of the county and city council is inappropriate, it should be reported to the provincial government for approval. (2) When the people petition the county and city council, the county and city councilors have no right to deal with it according to the law. (3) If the inquiry of the reporter by the county and city councilors in the meeting has reached the level of insult, they shall be liable for legal responsibility. (4) In order to take into account the facts and save expenses, the meeting period of the county and city councilors shall be changed to once every six months. (5) The county and city council shall not set up resident committees according to the law. After this single rule was stipulated, everyone understood that the farce of the government and the council had reached a climax, and the time for the curtain to fall might not be far away. Then, the

peace talk representatives from both sides came forward, and the third party also came out to mediate with the old method of "a toast to bury the hatchet." It is said that the solution has been quietly prepared. The two Chens and Lius who were to be suspended no longer insisted on "resigning," but changed to "taking a temporary rest" pending the court's investigation. On the one hand, they no longer insisted on "retaining their positions," but changed to appointing someone from the original senior staff of the department to "act as" the head of the department. If the results of the investigation in the future were indeed unsatisfactory, they would of course be reinstated according to the law, but for the time being, they would have to "take a temporary rest." Furthermore, the person appointed as the acting head of the department would have to meet the Qingdao council and the councilors to say that this was "giving face." In fact, this "dispute between the government and the council" was just a show on the surface, and there seemed to be a lot of news behind the scenes.

### Miniature News

Qingpu

[Our report] The current traffic between Qingpu and Shanghai has been interrupted due to the closure of Hongqiao Airport. However, the vehicles transporting troops are still left in Shanghai. Qingpu only has two vehicles left. In order to maintain the livelihood of the staff, the company operates one vehicle a day, up to Wujiaxiang. The fare is one silver dollar. Passengers can go from Wujiaxiang to Qishi, and along the Caobao Highway through Caohe to Xujiahui, and enter the city. There are tricycles available. However, the military department's inspection in the middle is strict. Those who do not have a Shanghai ID card are not allowed to enter the city. Luggage should not be carried too much, otherwise it will be troublesome. Since Shanghai stipulated that residents must enter the city with an ID card, the state of fleeing in Qingpu has immediately disappeared, and the degree of panic among residents has gradually decreased. The market is said to be stable, but the price of rice has plummeted. Because wealthy families are afraid of mobs looting, they sell their stockpiled rice, so the price has fallen. There is a strange shortage of cash, and the exchange rate of silver dollars is being reduced, with no standard at all. Residents no longer have the mood to gamble, so gambling is rare, and the sound of cards is no longer heard. Elementary schools are still open as usual, but it is heard that some teachers in some schools do not go to school to avoid the disaster, leaving the students sitting idly.

Huangyan

[Our report] The whole street of Xiatangjiao, an important coastal commercial town in the southeast of Huangyan, went on strike on the 19th. The reason is that the prices of goods in various commercial stores have risen several times a day. After the goods are sold, they are purchased again, and the materials cannot offset each other, so they are closed and closed down.

Jinhua

[Our report] At 8:00 am on the 21st, the first steel beam of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, a car machine towed three tool cars to the Jinhua River Bridge, dismantled the original wooden truss beam to Ganzhou application, Jinhua River Bridge by hole modification copper beam.

Chongming

[Our report] Traffic between Shen and Chong is blocked, and people and houses are not allowed to enter or exit at will. Fortunately, it is surrounded by the sea on all sides, and only needs to be quiet as always, still maintaining the throne of "Shangri-La". Prices here have plummeted, with white rice at 250,000 yuan per dou and corn at 120,000 yuan per dou. However, the prices of imported goods have risen rapidly due to the interruption of the source. The 400,000 people on the island are unusually calm.

Jiading

[Our report] There is a strange shortage of cash here, and no one is interested in anything. However, people's hearts are stable, and all primary and secondary schools are open as usual. The transportation of rice out of the city is prohibited. The local area only needs to be good.
