### National Army Launches Full-Scale Offensive in Pudong; Fiercely Fights Using Intense Firepower; Recovers Dozens of Strongholds Southeast of Gaoqiao

[Central News Agency, This City] Military Dispatch: A telephone call from the Pudong front at 9:30 PM on the 22nd stated: (1) A certain unit of our army, in coordination with friendly forces in Gaoqiao, launched a fierce attack on bandits who had fled north from Xijiazhai and bandits who had fled north from Zhoujiaqiubridge from the west on the morning of the 22nd. The bandits attempted to flee in different directions but were intercepted and annihilated by our forces. The bandits suffered heavy casualties. Our forces continued the pursuit to places like Xujiazhai, Majiazhai, Zhoujiazhai, and Taojiazhai. In this battle, over a thousand bandits were killed or wounded. A certain elite unit launched a fierce attack, killing over 500 bandits and capturing 32 alive (including one bandit battalion commander). They seized five heavy machine guns, over 20 submachine guns, and over 200 rifles. Over 500 remnant bandits infiltrated our army's positions through gaps. Our army immediately imposed a strict blockade to encircle and annihilate them. The bandits attempted to break through and escape, but under our fierce artillery fire, they failed and were completely annihilated. In the afternoon at 7:00 PM, several hundred more bandits arrived and are currently under our close surveillance, unable to act rashly. (4) In the afternoon of the 22nd, about 200 bandits in front of Tangqiao attempted to infiltrate our positions. Our certain unit bravely launched an offensive, killing 27 bandits on the spot and seizing 25 rifles. We suffered no casualties.

[Central News Agency, This City] Military Dispatch: General Zou Peng, commander of a certain division of the National Army, received orders on the 21st to lead his troops across the river to search and suppress bandits in the southeastern area of Gaoqiao in Pudong. After completing appropriate deployments, Zou's troops launched a full-scale offensive at 8:00 AM on the 22nd. The officers and soldiers were in high spirits. The commander, a local leader with extensive experience in fighting bandits, personally led the charge at the front line. The bandit army put up fierce resistance, but ultimately, due to the extraordinary bravery of our soldiers, they were largely annihilated in an overwhelming offensive like the autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves. The remnant bandits fled in disarray, unable to form ranks. Dozens of important strongholds in the southeastern area of Gaoqiao, including Qujiazhai, Chenwang Sanzhai, Chenjiazhai, and the Xiyancangqiao area, were all captured in one fell swoop, creating one of the most astonishing scenes since the start of the Battle of Shanghai. The commander is currently leading his troops to pursue and suppress the fleeing bandits and is engaged in combat with bandit reinforcements.

[Central News Agency, This City] Military Dispatch: A telephone call from the front at 2:00 PM on the 22nd stated: (1) The bandits who have invaded Pudong have suffered heavy casualties due to our counterattacks in recent days. Since approximately 2:00 AM on the 21st, reinforcements have been advancing towards our front lines at Lujiazhai, Chenjiadang, and Yangjiazhai (all located southwest of Gaoqiao Town). Our defending forces bravely counterattacked, engaging in fierce fighting throughout the night. After dawn, the bandits repeatedly launched fierce attacks using human wave tactics more than ten times. Our defending forces, relying on intense firepower, inflicted extremely painful blows on the attacking bandits under the combined operations of the naval and air forces. By noon yesterday (the 22nd), the bandits' offensive had been thwarted due to heavy casualties. Our defending forces launched a full-scale offensive, capturing over 200 bandits, seizing one 82-4 cannon, over 20 light machine guns, and a large quantity of other war spoils. It is estimated that the bandits suffered a large number of casualties throughout the day due to attacks and bombings by our naval and air forces.

(2) In the southeastern area of Yuepu, bandits advanced towards our Yangjiazhai positions at around 6:00 AM yesterday (the 22nd). Our defending forces were prepared and immediately gave them a head-on blow. After their attempt to advance was thwarted, the bandits retreated. Our army did not pursue.

(3) The bandits facing Liuhang have been severely battered by our defending forces. The strength of a certain bandit unit has been virtually eliminated. The remnant bandits, aware of the extraordinary bravery of our defending forces, have not dared to act rashly in recent days. Therefore, the war situation on that line has been quite quiet. Our strong forces are currently sweeping and suppressing the area and strengthening fortifications in preparation to inflict even greater blows on the bandits.

(4) Xu Fuzeng, a communication soldier of the bandit army in the Pudong area, and soldiers Fang Zhengcai and Cui Qishun, along with more than ten others, were originally soldiers captured by the bandits during the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign. Unwilling to be driven by the bandits, they defected with their weapons after our army's political warfare personnel shouted to them from the front lines. According to them, two bandit armies invaded Pudong this time,妄想attempting to open up a corridor to the Wusongkou area. However, they were fiercely attacked by our loyal and calm defending forces for days, and their attempt failed. They suffered heavy losses and their morale is extremely low.

(5) Last night, more than ten soldiers, including Ouyang Bo and Cao Xianmin, machine gunners from a certain bandit army's mountain artillery battalion, defected to our army with their weapons. These soldiers were all captured during the retreat from Nanjing.

### Fierce Fighting on the Qibao Line in Southwestern Shanghai; Localized Engagements in Yuepu, Yanghang, and Liuhang

[Central News Agency, This City] Military Dispatch: A telephone call from the front at 10:00 PM on the 22nd stated that approximately 400 bandits in Qibao attempted to attack our main positions several times yesterday (the 22nd) under cover of intense artillery fire. A certain unit of our defending forces bravely counterattacked, repelling the invading bandits one by one. Our southern main positions are secure due to strong forces and brave soldiers.

[Central News Agency, This City] Military Dispatch: A telephone call from the Yuepu front at 8:00 PM on the 22nd stated that there was no major fighting yesterday (the 22nd) on the lines of Yuepu, Yanghang, and Liuhang. There were only localized small-scale engagements. We took the opportunity to strengthen fortifications in order to wait for an opportunity to inflict a severe blow on the bandits again.

[Central News Agency, This City] The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters issued a battle report at 12:00 AM on the 22nd:

(1) On the Qibao line in southwestern Shanghai, which had been quiet for many days, fierce localized fighting broke out again after 8:00 PM on the 21st. A bandit unit of over 2,000, with eight small cannons, launched a fierce attack on the forward defensive line of our advanced positions. The defending forces bravely fought back, engaging in fierce fighting for five hours. The bandits suffered heavy casualties and their attempt failed. They then urgently increased reinforcements in an attempt to make a final struggle. Our army adopted mobile tactics, luring the incoming bandits to the main positions. Infantry and artillery simultaneously concentrated their fire, counterattacking. By approximately 4:00 AM on the 22nd, the bandits had suffered over half their forces in casualties. Our defending forces' reserve units also outflanked the enemy's rear, cooperating in an encirclement attack. Currently, the remaining bandit units are being surrounded and annihilated by us.

(2) At approximately 3:00 AM on the 22nd, our Lujiazhai forces east of Zhoujiadu encountered over 300 invading bandits. Fierce fighting lasted until approximately 6:00 AM. The bandits suffered over 60 dead or wounded and retreated to their original positions.

(3) Over 1,000 bandits between Luqiao and Laozhai west of Yuepu made contact with our defending forces' outposts at 2:00 AM on the 22nd. Fighting continued until approximately 5:00 AM and has not yet ceased. According to reports, the National Army in that area has been resting and replenishing for the past three days, and their morale is very high. Positive battle results are expected.

(4) On the Yanghang front, our army dispatched an elite unit on a mobile offensive on the night of the 21st, engaging over 2,000 bandits northwest of Yanghang. The bandit army responded hastily in the dim light of night. After offering slight resistance, they retreated in disarray along the entire line. Our army, having accomplished its mission, safely returned to its original positions. There was also sporadic fighting on the Liuhang line on the 21st. The defending forces continue to maintain a favorable posture, confronting the bandits.

### Various Industries in the City Respond; Host War Heroes

[Central News Agency, This City] Since the start of the Battle of Shanghai, the war situation has been extremely fierce. Fortunately, our army, navy, and air force officers and soldiers have fought bravely, repeatedly thwarting the enemy's attacks. Commander-in-Chief Tang, in order to honor the brave officers and soldiers who have been suppressing bandits, has established a "Heroes' Hall" at the International Hotel since May 20th, inviting tradesmen from the combat, photography, and hair dressing industries who have contributed to bandit suppression. Moved by righteous indignation, they have unanimously responded to Commander-in-Chief Tang's call, generously providing free services to the heroes to boost morale, which is of no small benefit to the nation. It is reported that starting today (the 23rd), the dance hall industry in the city will also respond. The heroes bravely sacrifice themselves to defend Shanghai. The six million conscientious and passionate citizens of Shanghai should actively respond, providing greater material and spiritual comfort to the war heroes, so that Shanghai will forever be the democratic and free Shanghai of our six million citizens.

### Overseas Chinese Groups Returning from the Americas Initiate Donation Drive to Support the Troops; Fundraising Methods Approved in Germany Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd] The Commemorative Meeting of the American Chinese Alliance held a standing committee meeting at 2:00 PM on the 22nd. In addition to resolving many important association matters, Director Chen Gunyao proposed that, considering the soldiers at the front line sincerely serve the country, shedding blood in the war of resistance, bravely fighting and repeatedly achieving victory, which is gratifying to the entire nation, this association, as a group of overseas Chinese compatriots from various parts of the Americas returning to Germany, should immediately send telegrams and raise donations to comfort the soldiers at the front line. He also telegraphed overseas Chinese compatriots in various parts of the Americas to launch a large-scale fundraising campaign to comfort the troops. The proposal was unanimously approved by the entire meeting, and fifteen comrades, including Zhu Binglin and Xi Yao, were designated as fundraisers. Chen Gunyao was appointed to be responsible for the gathering and they immediately held donation pledges. Li Huayan donated 300 yuan (Hong Kong dollars), Ye Zonglian and Yu Jingting 200 yuan each, Zhong Yulou 100 yuan, Zhao Hanyi, Li Tingyi, Chen Huanzhang, Li Yiru, Huang Wojun, and Li Minhan 50 yuan each, Wu Fengzhen 30 yuan, Li Ziping, Li Yuanlai, Li Zijing, Huang Qiwu, Chen Gunyao, and Zhou Jiesan 20 yuan each (all in Hong Kong dollars).

### Hong Kong Dollar Price Continues to Decline

[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 21st] The exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar fell to its lowest price tonight, at HK$6.95 per US$1. Financial figures here believe the devaluation of the Hong Kong dollar is due to (1) the Hong Kong government's prohibition of free gold trading, (2) the large influx of Hong Kong dollars from China, and (3) the fact that the local people of Hong Kong are exchanging Hong Kong dollars for other foreign currencies.

Since the breakdown of the Communist-Nationalist peace talks in Peiping, the government has decided to oppose Communism to the end. Acting President Li originally believed that seeking peace with the Communist Party was possible, but now he understands that the Communist Party has no sincerity for peace, so he has decided to oppose Communism to the end, until the Communist Party surrenders. He concluded that the government will definitely achieve final victory. He requested overseas Chinese in the United States to provide the government with spiritual support.

### Navy Launches Extensive Offensive; Pudong Seaside Bathing Beach Has Been Recovered

[Central News Agency, This City] The Naval Headquarters announced yesterday's battle report, stating that the First Fleet of our Navy, under the personal supervision of Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing, launched an extensive offensive on the previous night (the 21st) and yesterday morning (the 22nd), braving adverse weather conditions. On one hand, it proactively and fiercely attacked the bandit offensive areas in Zhoupu, Chuansha, and Gaoqiao, as well as the bandit army assembly areas in Yangjiazha, Dongku, and Xiejiazhai, using main guns supplemented by machine guns to support the land defending forces. On the other hand, it attacked bandit forces in areas such as Yuepu and Yanghang, with shelling beginning at 4:00 AM and continuing until 12:00 PM, conducting eight hours of border operations. The bandits in each attacked area suffered heavy casualties. The bandit offensive in the Chuansha and Gaoqiao areas has been thwarted. The results of this offensive were brilliant. The bandits suffered at least 5,000 casualties. Our Lianrong vessel, due to overexertion in combat, had one soldier injured in the artillery battle. Our Colonel Liu Guangkai adopted new tactics, commanding the ×× vessel, using the main guns for plowing-style firing, with great success. During the battle, we repeatedly received telegrams from the army stating that the main guns were powerful and the firing was accurate. The seaside bathing beach, previously occupied by the bandits, was recovered by the defending forces yesterday morning due to our navy's fierce shelling. This was witnessed through long-range binoculars, with the army's vanguard forces storming into the area under the powerful bombardment of the navy's firepower.

### Lecture at the Party Affairs Work Training Session - Full Text of Yan Xishan's Speech

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st] The Party Affairs Work Cadre Training Session, hosted by the Central Party Headquarters, was held at 4 PM on the 20th in the Central Party Headquarters meeting hall. Mr. Yan Bochuan, Director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, was invited to speak. Over a hundred people attended, and his words were earnest and to the point, earning continuous applause. The meeting adjourned around 5 PM. The full text of Mr. Yan's speech is recorded below:

Fellow comrades, all of you have been engaged in local work for many years and must have abundant experience. I truly have little room to offer my own opinions. However, I am grateful for your acceptance and will share my humble views for your reference.

Our Party bears the responsibility of governing the country and should study common goals in terms of governance principles and techniques, reaching a consensus in understanding and acting in unison. In terms of governance principles, both reason and strength must be emphasized. There is no supreme judge in the international arena; in reality, reason and strength are inseparable. Ideals are advanced through strength, and strength relies on reason. Strength without reason is bound to fail, and reason without strength cannot be advanced. Therefore, to establish a nation, it is necessary to cultivate strength and uphold reason. This cultivation of strength and upholding of reason is the principle of governance. Upholding reason is not just for external affairs; it is even more crucial internally. If only strength is considered, regardless of what is right or wrong, only focusing on what is possible, and doing it if it's possible, then it becomes unreasonable strength. Whether internally or externally, this will ultimately lead to failure. The goal of cultivating strength and upholding reason is the principle of governance. How to cultivate strength and uphold reason is the technique of governance. The technique of governance requires subjective actions to meet objective needs, like the hands of a clock turning in accordance with the Earth's rotation. If they don't align, the clock becomes useless. Similarly, the actions of politics itself must meet the needs of the people.

The premise of political measures must align with environmental demands. One cannot wear fur in summer or linen in winter. To ask the people to contribute money and effort, it must be suitable to their needs and their economic capacity. If the wealthy avoid contributing effort and even avoid contributing money, while the poor contribute both effort and money, then no matter how important the matter is, the people may resist. The technique of governance is to unify politics with the environment and objective reality.

Our Party has emphasized the technique of governance for many years. You, who are doing local work, especially emphasize completing the principle of governance with the technique of governance. The entire strength depends on creative ability for development. So-called creation means various measures that are suitable for oneself and the environment at the right time. The second is imitative ability. Imitation must be appropriate. A country without the ability to imitate is undoubtedly foolish. However, if imitation is inappropriate, it is equivalent to madness. Those who criticize poor imitators are often compared to someone who "sees a leg paralyzed and cuts off their own leg to save their life." A mad imitator without a leg ailment also cuts off his leg. Such mad imitation is inferior to the foolishness of poor imitation.

Since our Party came to power, it has demonstrated many creative measures. Our Party comrades should continue to enhance our creative abilities to adapt to the environment, cultivate our strength, and save us from danger. Comrades who are responsible for being close to the people are the key link between superiors and subordinates. Linking the importance of the nation and the needs of the people, allowing politics to penetrate the people, and enabling the people's strength to manifest in their struggle for survival is the sole task of comrades who bear local responsibility.

Furthermore, many new terms in our country today come directly from Europe and America or indirectly from Japan. Their meanings often differ from the original meanings in our country. Interpretations and definitions vary. For example, realizing democracy and freedom is today's most powerful goal. What exactly does democracy govern? How does it govern? Especially in the process of realization, how to cultivate democracy, guide democracy, and protect democracy so that it can proceed smoothly? If there are no appropriate methods in the process, then the goal is to seek democratic governance, but in reality, it results in democratic chaos. During wartime, the people demand the abolition of conscription, grain requisitions, and taxes. However, the need for soldiers, funds, and grain for the war is obvious. Demanding the abolition of conscription, grain requisitions, and taxes is equivalent to demanding the cessation of warfare. In the ninth year of the Republic [1920], a compatriot from Taiwan said to me that the average annual burden per person in Taiwan was forty yuan. He asked me what the average burden per person in Shanxi was. I replied that it was four yuan per person. He said that everyone he met on the way from Shanghai and Beiping to Taiyuan said that the burden in Shanxi was heavy. This was only one-tenth of the burden on the people of Taiwan. I asked him if returning to the mainland would reduce his burden. He solemnly said: Reducing the burden is not happiness. Today, whether in a strong or a declining country, everyone must bear a heavy burden. Strong countries use the burden of the people to sustain themselves and conquer other countries. The people of a vanquished country must also bear a burden to supply the conquering country. What is heartbreaking is that the people of a vanquished country bear a heavy burden and even have no right to attend middle school. In our country, some boast of advocating the abolition of harsh taxes. In our understanding, harsh taxes should be abolished. However, what is considered harsh and what is considered miscellaneous should be examined. If we do not understand this properly and abolish harsh taxes, we will abolish the foundation for building a strong and civilized national defense, social construction, stabilizing the country, and ensuring the people's livelihood. All of these require the people to bear a burden, but it is a burden that is borne fairly and justly. It must be used to become strong and civilized. The burden should be carefully considered for stability and development. However, the people think that stability and development are later on and are everyone's needs, while the burden is personal. Reconciling this contradiction is the biggest challenge in revitalizing the country. To think that a small burden is sufficient is a hasty consideration. When I heard this, I immediately felt that it was reasonable and felt ashamed. For example, freedom is said to be a symbol of happiness for an individual and a nation, but it should be applied appropriately and have appropriate interpretations and scope. "Give me liberty, or give me death" refers to freedom within a certain scope. "Oh Liberty, what crimes are committed in thy name!" The freedom beyond this scope. If one is afraid to talk about order and discipline because of freedom, then freedom can break through the happiness of communal life, hinder human progress, and tear apart human security. Comrades who lead rural work must accurately explain the meaning and scope of freedom and guide the people's actions into the orbit of freedom.

Our failure today is often criticized by outsiders for our corruption. For example, even if military discipline is good, the political effect is not great. We should humbly accept this and strive to improve. However, in my opinion, even if all of the above points are completely improved, we cannot resist the enemy. Because the strategy used by the enemy is a mass-based political war. They confiscate the property of the vast majority of people, buy off their so-called popular leaders, and then use terror. In a local area, they only eliminate their opponents and use terror and coercion to completely turn neutral people into a force united by common interests and survival. They blockaded their military situation and everything else, making us blind. They spread lieutenants everywhere and expanded their rationality. Watching them boast as if they were gambling with their countrymen, they grew transparent eyes. Watching them come out, it is always clear the law is magnetism. We are at war with the enemy. We do not know everything about the enemy, but the enemy knows everything about us. I attack the enemy, and most of me escapes. The enemy attacks me, using strength to strike weakness. If the Battle of Shanghai was like boats colliding, the stronger would win. The enemy's mass-based political war is like water overturning a boat. A boat cannot overcome water, and the boat will ultimately fail. Today, we must change our political strategy and our military strategy. We must organize the people. The work of organizing the people depends entirely on the efforts of the comrades who bear local responsibility. In today's struggle with the masses as the door, after fierce struggle and heated competition, the organization will become more popular, and the square art has become scientific. To organize townships, one must first organize baojia. To organize baojia, one must first organize households. To organize households, one must first investigate the life experience of each person in each household, what suffering they have experienced, and especially pay attention to what suffering they have experienced from our enemies. After a clear investigation, implement household visits. This is the first step.

When visiting, focus on the individual suffering of the person being visited as an entry point for winning them over. Based on this suffering, reveal the evils of society and the brutality of the enemy, and inspire their personal compassion. Also, make them feel that you are the only one who loves them, saves them, and even shed tears to show sympathy. This is the second step.

Then, for each person in their entire family, separately consider the mentality formed in their life experiences and their personal environmental relationships. Regarding the composition of people's experiences, such as the daughter-in-law in his family, be sure to investigate the family background of the woman's family and the life thoughts of each person. Such as the girl in his family, be sure to investigate his mother-in-law’s family’s family background and each person’s life thoughts, and estimate whether they can be won over. If they cannot be won over, how to comfort and guard against them. If they can be won over, what method to use to win them over. Whether to win over one person, or several people. How many times to win over. This is the third time. Usually, ten earnest talks can organize people who are easy to organize. People who cannot be organized by a hundred earnest talks are ultimately not easy to win over. The same ten earnest talks, ten earnest talks by one person, are not as effective as two or three people. A long earnest talk is not as effective as an earnest talk that helps people work. An earnest talk is usually loose at first, tight in the middle, and long afterward. Loose means talking once every two or three days. Tight in the middle means talking once a day, or two or three times a day. Long afterward means continuing to talk once a week for a long time after a month. The above earnest talk time should be short, and the words should be pertinent, so as not to arouse the people's boredom. If he has a special situation or a special difficulty arises, talk to him immediately, comfort him as appropriate, and investigate him from the side as appropriate. Pay attention to the reaction of himself and others. This is the fourth step.

The purpose of an earnest talk is not simply to understand, but to organize after understanding. Depending on the number of people in the family, organize a small family group of two or three people. Pay special attention to children, because children are enthusiastic and frank. This is the fifth step.

Organization is easy, leadership is difficult. After organizing, it is necessary to provide close, progressive, and constant leadership. In the leadership style, you must make people not feel that it is leadership, but care. This is the sixth step.

For example, after a family group is organized, and then organize baojia, there must be a work team of three to five people. In addition, the leader of the team must be enthusiastic, diligent, humble, and able to go deep into the people's families and not leave the people. One guarantee must also be a work leadership team of three to five people. The person in charge of this team should be well-trained in the short term, and must have a consistent understanding of the overall goal and consistent action in the work. Give him a higher political level and leadership ability, and combine political methods with the people's living conditions to lead his bao cadres and deploy the work of the whole guarantee. Townships must have a leadership team of five to seven people. The person in charge of this team must have undergone collective training in the province, with equal emphasis on cultural level and political level. The cultural level can be expressed in writing. The political level must have the intelligence to smash the enemy's political offensive and counterattack the enemy's political conspiracy with one's own political offensive. Be able to lead and deploy the work of cadres in the whole township, and be able to enthusiastically encourage the people of the whole township to have a political orientation towards me. This is the seventh step.

If we can complete this work of organizing the masses, we can heal our double blindness, remove the enemy's far-sightedness, and complete the enemy's double blindness. Make the enemy scattered. We will beat them to death. Unite and trap them to death. We avoid reality and strike at emptiness, eat the small with the big, and grow stronger every day. There is a way to do things militarily.

Fellow comrades have studied organizational work and have much experience. What I have said above is only based on what I have learned from my humble opinions and is for your reference.

### Visiting the Jiangdong Battlefield

[Report from this newspaper] Since the defense of Greater Shanghai shifted from the Yuepu-Liuhang line to Pudong, all six million citizens of Shanghai have been paying close attention to its development. To understand the actual situation of the fighting on that front, this reporter braved the rain again on the morning of the 22nd to visit Pudong.

Looking at the overall situation of the Shanghai battle, Pudong should be the least important battlefield. This was the case during the January 28th Incident and the August 13th Incident. The reason is that for a long and narrow area like Pudong, if the opposing side arranges heavy troops in such a terrain, it is a "great taboo in military strategy." It is easy for the opponent to go down from Xin Zhuang and Minhang via Fengxian to the coast, cut off its rear supply line, and then completely surround and annihilate it. But why are the communist forces doing this today? Of course, we cannot attribute it to Chen Yi being a man of letters and not understanding major military principles. However, it is at least an undeniable military adventure.

Originally, Chen Yi's initial battle plan was to use elite troops to attack the Shizilin, Yuepu, Yanghang, and Liuhang lines, attempting to occupy Wusongkou before the 15th, control the Huangpu River, cut off the water transportation of Greater Shanghai, and then use a "nerve offensive" to pressure the National Army into "local peace." He did not expect that the communist forces' plan would be completely crushed by the head-on blow of Liu Yuzhang's Long Victory Army. Instead, the communist forces barely occupied Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha in the first four days of the Shanghai battle. Therefore, Chen Yi changed his battle plan, believing that occupying the entire Pudong could achieve the same military result as occupying Wusongkou.

Originally, Chen Yi's regular army in Pudong was only the 30th Army. However, in order to carry out the above plan, he has been continuously increasing troops in Pudong in recent days. According to the materials obtained by the military, the units that have now been discovered include the 30th, 31st, 32nd, 33rd, 20th, 21st, and 35th Armies, a total of seven armies. Therefore, since the 17th, the communist forces in Pudong, which were originally a supporting attack, have now been changed to a main attack. The branch battlefield has now become the main battlefield.

In response to this new situation on the battlefield, the Supreme Commander of the Shanghai Battle, General Tang, in order to crush Chen Yi's military adventure, in addition to sending heavy troops to take over the defense of Pudong and strengthen the troop strength in that area, also specially transferred General Que Hanqian, the famous general who expeditioned to India and Myanmar during the War of Resistance Against Japan, to be the commander of a certain army group, responsible for commanding the fighting in that area.

Commander Que is also an old friend of the reporter. Although we have not seen each other for many years, his humor remains unchanged. He is from Hunan, but his tall stature leads people to believe that he is a typical northerner. Therefore, astrologers say that he is a "southerner with a northern face," so he is destined for nobility. In fact, not only his stature resembles a northerner, but also his personality is completely that of a northerner. This time, we were naturally especially happy to meet. He told us many stories about the "Liberation Army" of the communist forces in Shandong, Hebei, and other places. He said: Gaoqiao is still firmly defended by the National Army. The National Army's forward positions are about three or four li south of Gaoqiao on the Zhangjiazhai, Yangjiazhai, and Lujiazhai lines. Although the communist forces have been attacking continuously for five days, the result has only been the complete annihilation of the 30th Army. Recently, reinforcements have been continuously transferred, and although they once occupied Guijiazhai north of Donggou on the 18th, they still failed to shake our main position in the slightest.

At present, the National Army's defense line south of Donggou is the line from Qingning Temple in the north via Nongjia Wood Factory, Yangjing Middle School, Pudong Middle School to Zhoujiadu and its vicinity. The National Army's strength in this area is also very strong.

According to Chief of Staff Shen of a certain army group, he told me: On the afternoon of the 18th of this month at about 1 PM, Commander Que had just gone to the front line to direct the battle. Because the communist forces facing him were rushing fiercely towards the city ferry from Guijiazhai north of Donggou, Commander Que directed the tanks to assist the infantry in a full-scale blockade. Two seconds after he got out of his jeep, the left window of his jeep was hit by a machine gun bullet. The glass shattered into a large hole, but Que continued to supervise the battle as if nothing had happened. The enemy soldiers retreated, and the position was stabilized as a result. His courage and calmness were like this. When the reporter went this time, he also saw the jeep with the broken glass in his headquarters.

At his headquarters, the reporter also interviewed many prisoners of war, most of whom were from Shandong, and some were National Army soldiers who had been captured in the Huaihai Campaign and sent to the front line after training. They were covered in mud. According to them, they had not eaten a grain of rice for three days and nights in trenches full of rainwater. Their treatment was still the market price of one catty of pork per month converted into people's coupons.

During the six hours that the reporter stayed on the front line, it was unusually quiet. There was no shooting or artillery fire. According to Commander Que, they were changing defenses today because they had sacrificed a lot last night. Therefore, we were able to enjoy the Zhang Yu brandy that Commander Que brought back from the battle of Yantai 44 years ago in the most relaxed mood. It turned out that when the National Army recovered Yantai on October 1st of the year before last, it was his army that entered Yantai City first.

### Editorial: Relieving Refugees and Rescuing the Wounded

The ruthless flames of war have spread to the outskirts of Shanghai. All suburbs, including Jiangwan, Dachang, Wusong, Xinshi, Zhenru, Beixinjing, Gaoqiao, Yangjing, Sisheng, Longhua, and Hongqiao, have been or will become battlefields. As a result, ordinary citizens are flocking to the urban areas, becoming homeless and destitute refugees. The city's Social Affairs Bureau has already prepared and distributed 1,000 piculs of rice to provide relief to the affected residents in the suburbs and is looking for houses in various places to accommodate them. However, the work of relieving refugees is only handled by a small number of people from the Social Affairs Bureau. Both in terms of manpower and material resources, it will feel inadequate. Therefore, we cannot but hope that social charities can stand on the position of humanitarianism and come out to assist the society in shouldering this arduous task.

According to reports, the Red Cross Society of China, the Red Swastika Society, the Roman Catholic Church, the Christian Church, the YMCA of China, the Children's Welfare Association, the Buddhist Association, Renji Hall, and other charitable organizations, hometown associations, and public welfare groups have jointly launched an "Shanghai United Relief Committee," and prominent Shanghai figures such as Yan Huiqing, Ben Sihao, and Huang Hanzhi are in charge of it. Based on the past situation of relief work in Shanghai, this "United Relief Organization" will surely seek welfare for thousands and millions of refugees and will surely be trusted by the six million citizens of Shanghai. In the process of carrying out its mission of relieving refugees, no matter what needs there are, citizens will ultimately be able to jump forward and contribute, truly achieving "those with money contribute money, and those with strength contribute strength."

Shanghai is a commercial and industrial city. The traditional spirit of Shanghai citizens, in a nutshell, lies in the word "righteousness." Regardless of the social strata, they can fully recognize the true meaning of "mutual assistance" and "cooperation." The most popular saying, "The poor rely on the rich, and the rich rely on the poor," contains infinite meaning. In the past fifteen years, Shanghai has suffered many disasters: the January 28th Incident of 1932, the August 13th Shanghai Battle of 1937, and the December 8th Pacific War of 1941. Each time the storm struck, it caused Shanghai citizens to live and die. Fortunately, Shanghai citizens all have the spirit of sharing the same boat in a storm and deeply understand the great meaning of "mutual assistance" and "cooperation," which ultimately allowed Shanghai to turn danger into safety and transform peril into peace. There is no need to say anything else, just in terms of refugee relief, the strict organization, the large scope, the large number of people accommodated, and the combination of relief and education are beyond the reach of any city. This is a manifestation of the traditional spirit of Shanghai citizens and also a glorious record of Shanghai citizens. Although the nature of this unfortunate war disaster is different from the past, we should still strive to relieve refugees from a humanitarian standpoint. Therefore, we would like to offer the following suggestions for refugee relief work.

First, relieving refugees is a sacred cause for the six million citizens of Shanghai. Everyone has a responsibility. Regardless of gender, regardless of wealth, they must fulfill their duty as a citizen. In other words, we hope that the six million citizens of Shanghai can truly reach the point of "those with money contribute money, and those with strength contribute strength." Fundraising is the responsibility of wealthy citizens, and the implementation of relief work should rely on the enthusiastic service of ordinary citizens.

Second, as the flames of war increasingly press towards the urban area, stray bullets and other unfortunate incidents are inevitable. Therefore, our so-called relief work, in addition to relieving the homeless refugees in the suburbs, must also shoulder the work of rescuing wounded citizens. This is work related to medical services, and we cannot but hope that the city's doctors, nurses, and major hospitals will do their best.

Third, Shanghai is an international city. Among today's vast refugee population, there is no shortage of people from all over the world. Among those who unfortunately suffer casualties in the future, there will naturally also be expatriates from various countries. Therefore, we should also ask the World Red Cross Society, which has a good reputation in the international community, to step forward, participate in the work, relieve the refugees in Shanghai, and rescue the unfortunate wounded people in Shanghai.

In short, doing good is the greatest joy. Saving people from suffering is already the noblest and most sacred virtue of mankind, let alone in this time of war and danger, sacrificing oneself for the group and using one's surplus material and human resources to help others is what everyone in Shanghai is willing to do today. We hope that the six million citizens of Shanghai can participate in this great work of relieving refugees and rescuing the wounded.

### The True Picture of Peace in Beiping

Continued from page 4 of the 21st

According to the Xinhua News Agency, the two celebration rallies were representative of Beiping residents' revelry. However, anyone with a slightly more objective perspective will tell you that Beiping residents' revelry was on January 1st, not February 3rd, and especially not February 12th. The so-called welcome and celebration were nothing more than the Party singing its own praises.

(8) So That's How It Is

Since Beiping changed hands, due to years of domestic and foreign troubles, coupled with the corruption and incompetence of some officials, the government had many shortcomings that made people dissatisfied. It was indeed difficult for all facilities to satisfy people's desires. People always tend to place their hopes in another world, especially one that is not easy to see. Many people imagined it as a perfect paradise. Furthermore, with the clever propaganda of preachers, it further attracted people's hearts. But when they truly arrived in this paradise and saw what it was like, they realized that the so-called paradise was "so that's how it is." The fortunate ladies who were able to reach paradise even wanted to sing "The Fairy Maiden Longs for the Mortal World."

Before local peace was implemented in Beiping, many people had imagined the realization of peace to be very satisfactory. But after peace was realized, they discovered a series of "so that's how it is." Here is a brief description:

(1) The people who advocated peace, their ideal was that after peace, the first step would be to establish a joint organization, equivalent to a coalition government. This coalition government would be the highest authority in North China. Although the committee members were initially three from the Kuomintang and four from the Communist Party, the Communist Party immediately used democracy and freedom to call for expanding the foundation in the future and welcoming participation from all parties and factions. Therefore, at the beginning of the signing of the peace agreement, it was widely rumored that ××× was actively organizing the Democratic Freedom Party, preparing to participate in the coalition government. But even though they knew that after the establishment of the joint organization, it would be silent and ineffective in the Zhongnanhai area, the administrative system of the other side was such that the highest authority was the Chinese Communist Party, with one party acting on behalf of the central government. Below that were the six "liberated areas" of North China, Northeast, Northwest, East China, Central Plains, and Qiongya. Each area had a people's government. The chairman of the North China "liberated area" people's government was Dong Biwu, and all the committee members were Communists. Not only were other parties and factions not allowed to participate, but the Kuomintang, the Democratic Socialist Party, the Youth Party, and all reactionary parties and groups were also to be disbanded, and the so-called reactionary elements were to be arrested. The Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, a mouthpiece of the Communist Party, after receiving Zhang Yijin's house on Xisi Beiwai Street, hung up a sign and openly carried out activities. Who knew that in less than three days, the sign was taken down, and the house was occupied by the garrison command. If this is the treatment of a mouthpiece, one can imagine what it is like for other parties. Not being allowed to participate in the government was already unexpected, but what was most surprising was that Zhang Yinwu, who advocated peace the earliest, was arrested as a military intelligence agent. Xu Huidong, who worked hardest to achieve peace, was called the chief culprit of the "July 5th Incident" and detained. He Siyuan, who knocked on the door of peace, was called a peace broker and is now at home studying democracy. They are discarding the bridge after crossing the river, cooking the hound after the hare is dead. How ungrateful can one be! After the signing of the peace agreement, on January 31st, there was still a plane flying to Suiyuan. On the lunar New Year's Day, I went to pay a New Year's visit to Huidong. I earnestly advised him to fly away, but he argued confidently at the time, believing that regarding the "July 5th Incident," first: even if the proposal was wrong, it was proposed by Ding Chunan, and he neither seconded it nor participated in the vote, so what did it have to do with him? Second: the students surrounded his residence and wanted to beat him, and he fled because he was afraid of being beaten, so that shouldn't be considered a crime. Third: regardless of who fired the first shot, the military had Chen Jicheng and the police had Yang Qingzhi, and even if you pushed the responsibility onto a hundred people, it wouldn't reach him. Moreover, everyone knew that he worked hardest to achieve peace, and even if the Communist Party was unreasonable, they wouldn't harm him. Who knew that before long, on the very day that the four peace elders from Shanghai arrived in Beiping, the Communist Party had already mobilized students to hunt him down? The most ridiculous thing was that because Huidong was the sixth child in his family, acquaintances called him "Sixth Brother" and called his one and only wife "Sixth Sister-in-law," but the People's Daily insisted on referring to our toothless old "Sixth Sister-in-law" as his sixth concubine. I really don't know what that meant.

Zhang Yinwu advocated the philosophy of Yan Yuan and Li Gong, and founded the Sicu School. The school had military training in peacetime, and during the War of Resistance Against Japan, it engaged in guerrilla warfare. The school had guns, as everyone knew. Who knew that the Communist Party wouldn't remember his contribution to advocating peace the earliest and instead used the pretext of having guns to falsely accuse him of being a KMT agent and arrest him. Heaven knows, anyone with political common sense wouldn't believe that Zhang Yinwu was a KMT agent. I think even the Communist Party themselves wouldn't believe their own words, but they still arrested him under a false pretense. What an injustice!

The story of He Siyuan's efforts to achieve peace has been described in detail before. After the Communist army entered the city, he disappeared and lived in seclusion to recover from his injuries. At first, I only knew that the People's Daily was coldly mocking him, saying that he and Gan Jiehou were both peace brokers for Li Zongren. Later, it was published in the Xinmin Daily that the authorities were sending him many books on Marxism-Leninism, ordering him to reflect on his mistakes behind closed doors and study democracy. His whereabouts were known, he was originally imprisoned at home. (To be continued)

### Sweeping Away the Cold War and Establishing World Peace: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference Opens Today

British, American, and French Positions Fully Agreed Upon After Secret Talks; Vyshinsky Arrives in Paris from Moscow

[Reuters Paris 22nd Dispatch] The most important conference in post-war Europe will open here on Monday morning. The fate of Germany and even world peace may depend on the outcome of this conference. The foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and France held another secret meeting on the morning of the 22nd, before the opening of the Foreign Ministers Conference, to review the positions of the three Western powers in this Foreign Ministers Conference. An official from the British Embassy revealed today that the three foreign ministers, Bevin, Acheson, and Schuman, held secret talks for two hours this morning at the French Foreign Ministry, and have reached a complete agreement on the positions to be adopted by the three countries in the Foreign Ministers Conference. News from Moscow this afternoon showed that Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, after arriving in Paris yesterday, continued to maintain contact with General Chuikov, commander of the Soviet forces in Germany, and listened to the developments in Berlin and Germany at any time. It is generally expected that although Vyshinsky will make some concessions at this Foreign Ministers Conference, he will also clearly express the Soviet Union's final position, beyond which no further changes will be allowed. Paris is filled with an atmosphere of tense anticipation today. Parisian newspapers warmly welcomed Vyshinsky, placing a photo of Vyshinsky's arrival in Paris in a prominent position on the front page.

[Agence France-Presse Paris 21st Dispatch] The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference will be held at 4:00 PM on Monday at the Palais de Marbre in Paris. People here tacitly acknowledge that the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and France have reached an agreement on the agenda to be proposed at the Foreign Ministers Conference during their preparatory meeting tonight. This agenda includes: (1) various issues related to Germany's economic policy; (2) the Berlin issue and the Berlin currency issue; (3) preparations for a peace treaty with Germany; and (4) the issue of completing the Austrian independence treaty.

[Reuters Paris 21st Dispatch] Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky arrived at Orly Airport in Paris from Moscow this afternoon to attend the Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, which will open on Monday. The entourage arrived on two planes, the first of which carried experts and consultants. Vyshinsky, wearing a gray suit, stepped out of the second plane with a smile. Soviet Ambassador Bogomolov was the first to come forward to welcome him. When reporters asked Vyshinsky for a few comments on this Foreign Ministers Conference, Vyshinsky replied in French that a statement would be issued later. After Vyshinsky shook hands with all the welcomers, he immediately boarded a car and went to the Soviet Embassy to rest.

[Agence France-Presse Paris 21st Dispatch] After arriving here, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky visited French Foreign Minister Schuman at the French Foreign Ministry tonight, and left after a conversation of only five minutes. Vyshinsky smiled and did not answer reporters' questions, only saying: "I am very pleased to be in Paris, and I will answer your questions in the future."

### West Berlin Labor Unrest Expands; Strikers Clash with Anti-Strikers; Gunfire Erupts, Over 500 Injured

[Associated Press Berlin 22nd Dispatch] Soviet Zone German police fired on railway strikers on the morning of the 22nd, injuring at least five people. At the same time, the all-day riots of the 21st reached a climax again. Over 500 people have been injured in clashes between strikers and Communist Party-led anti-strikers in the Berlin East and West Zone German police conflicts.

Due to the strike by 15,000 railway workers in West Berlin, elevated railway traffic in and out of Berlin has been virtually cut off. The shooting incidents occurred in two places. When Communist Party-led anti-strikers and armored Soviet Zone German police attempted to occupy the Nilu-Kolin station and clashed with strikers, more than 20 shots were fired, injuring at least five people. West Zone strikers attacked the Wunxi station, which was blockaded by anti-strikers and Soviet Zone German police, at midnight, but were unsuccessful. Casualties are still unknown. Both sides wielded guns, hoes, iron bars, and electric whips. However, it is said that only Communist Party-led anti-strikers fired shots. At the Nilu-Kolin station, anti-strikers occupied it after a bloody battle at one point, but were later driven out by a counterattack by strikers.

[Reuters Berlin 21st Dispatch] After the major conflict caused by the Berlin railway strike tonight, Soviet officials, Soviet Zone police, and the pro-Communist "Free German Youth" have occupied three of the forty stations in West Berlin. In the remaining stations, they are still guarded by independent trade union members, who do not allow Soviet Zone personnel to take over. The West Berlin stations are also managed by the Soviet Railway Bureau. The employees are striking because they are demanding to be paid in West German marks. 12,000 people are participating. During the conflict between employees and communists, some people fired shots into the air, and a train was burned.

Soviet Transportation Minister Injured in American Zone

Soviet Transportation Minister General Kvashmin was besieged by the crowd at the Heimendalas station in the American Zone and slightly injured. He was later rescued by West Zone police, who also arrested 22 of the ringleaders of the incidents at each station. The Berlin radio station controlled by the Soviet side stated that employees had destroyed several sections of the track between Potsdam and Vaernzai. Employees stated that the strike would not hinder trains from West Germany from going to Berlin, but by 6:00 PM, only one British and one American military train, and one train from the Ruhr, had arrived in Berlin. Brigadier General Horlai, commander of the American forces in Berlin, stated that if the actions of the railway police controlled by the Soviet side go beyond the scope of democracy or cannot maintain order, the West Berlin police will take over the stations. The American military will not take action unless the unrest expands and involves Allied personnel. An official from the Transportation Department of the British military government also stated that the labor unrest could be resolved quickly if the Soviet military government simply paid employees' wages in the legal currency of the West Zone—West German marks.

[United Press Berlin 21st Dispatch] Some of the striking railways in West Berlin resumed operation tonight, guarded by Soviet soldiers on board. One of them entered the American military zone, and the other entered the French military zone. Machine guns were mounted on the roofs of the cars. The clashes between strikers and police throughout the day resulted in 500 injuries. Workers cursed Soviet railway managers and threw stones. Communist guards at the Schohorniburg station released police dogs and bit one of the strikers. The tracks of the Liedanlat elevated railway station were dug up. At the same time, American and British planes continued air transport today to ensure the daily supply of 8,000 tons of food and fuel to West Berlin.

### If German Police Cannot Control the Situation, the American Military Will Take Action

Announcement by American Military Commander Horlai

[Agence France-Presse Berlin 21st Dispatch] Brigadier General Horlai, commander of the American forces in Berlin, told reporters today that the strike by railway workers in West Berlin is unfortunate, as it is taking place at the time of the Four-Power Conference. However, he acknowledged that workers have the right to take strike action, so the American military government has not ordered the strike to be stopped, but has pointed out to the trade union leaders that the Four-Power talks are about to begin. The trade union leaders have promised not to hinder traffic after the blockade is lifted. Horlai continued that wage disputes should be resolved between employers and employees themselves, so the American military government has consistently adopted a policy of non-interference, unless conflicts occur that the German police cannot control, in which case the American military will mobilize. Horlai also stated that the West Zone trade unions and the Berlin City Council have both attempted negotiations, but have been rejected by the railway authorities controlled by the Communist Party. The railway authorities are attempting to use more than 5,000 "yellow" Communist youths to restore operations under the protection of the police in the East Zone and have announced that they will shoot and kill anyone who prevents trains from operating.

### East-West German Trade Negotiations Have Fallen into Destruction

The American Side Indicates Agreement Was Almost Reached

[Agence France-Presse Berlin 21st Dispatch] Hainfrau, chairman of the East German Economic Commission, told reporters here today who held Soviet military licenses that the talks between representatives of the East and West German Economic Commissions on restoring inter-regional trade have reached a stalemate. The breakdown of the talks was due to the West German authorities' unwillingness to remove various restrictions that are harmful to inter-regional trade. These talks began in Berlin earlier this week, but the West German representatives soon left for Frankfurt, so no results were obtained and no date for continued negotiations was set.

[Agence France-Presse Berlin 21st Dispatch] Hayes, chief of the American forces in Germany, told reporters today that financial experts from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have almost reached an agreement at the final meeting. The experts have drafted a plan that allows for the start of credit loans between the occupied areas and then restores actual trade between East and West Germany.

[Agence France-Presse Berlin 21st Dispatch] Kvashning, director of transportation for the Soviet forces in Germany, informed the director of transportation for the American forces and the Four-Power experts' conference today that he has agreed to allow 31 barges to enter Berlin from West Germany to supply Berlin with food and other goods. This afternoon, the Four-Power experts held a special meeting here to discuss various issues after the resumption of traffic between East and West Germany, which lasted for three hours.

### The Bonn Parliamentary Constitution Obtains the Necessary Majority

### America Refuses to Release Nine Soviet Zone Germans

Horlai Indicates the Soviet Arrest of Germans is Illegal

[Reuters Berlin 22nd Dispatch] After nine Germans entered the American zone of Berlin and arrested a German, they were detained by the American authorities. General Kotikov, commander of the Soviet forces in Berlin, sent a letter to Brigadier General Horlai, commander of the American forces in Berlin, requesting the release of the nine Germans, but Horlai refused. Kotikov's letter pointed out that the nine were ordered by the Soviet authorities to arrest people in the American zone. Horlai's reply pointed out that five of the nine were carrying weapons, and they would be prosecuted for the "serious crime" of coercing Germans in the American zone to go to the Soviet zone. He also pointed out that several thousand Germans have recently disappeared from their homes, and solemnly declared to Kotikov, "I can no longer tolerate the kidnapping of anyone in the American zone of Berlin."

### A Million Italian Farm Workers Strike

[Reuters Rome 21st Dispatch] The strike of employed farm workers in Italy is expanding, and it is estimated that the number of strikers nationwide has reached one million.

### Austria Declares an Independent Position; If the Four Powers Cannot Reach an Agreement on the Austrian Treaty, They Will Immediately Demand the Withdrawal of the Occupation Forces of All Countries

[Reuters Vienna 22nd Dispatch] The Austrian People's Party, which holds a majority of seats in the National Assembly, unanimously approved the speech made by Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber to the party's congress last night, in which he stated that he would not hesitate to overturn the entire draft Austrian treaty. The resolution unanimously passed by the congress reiterated the content of Gruber's speech, stating: "If the Four Powers cannot reach an agreement on the Austrian treaty immediately, Austria will immediately demand the withdrawal of the occupation forces to complete the liberation, without waiting for the treaty to be concluded. If negotiations break down, the Austrian federal government will immediately announce its right to build a federal army on its own. Any power that refuses to withdraw the occupation forces from Austria will be accused by Austria to the United Nations authorities of aggression against Austria."

### Former American Secretary of Defense Forrestal Falls to His Death; He Was Being Treated in a Hospital for Nervous Fatigue

[Agence France-Presse Washington 22nd Dispatch] The Department of the Navy officially announced today that former Secretary of Defense Forrestal committed suicide by jumping from his hospital room at the Bethesda Naval Hospital near Washington at 2:00 AM today.

[Associated Press Washington 22nd Dispatch] Former Secretary of Defense Forrestal committed suicide by jumping from a building this morning, at the age of 57. Forrestal had been receiving treatment for nervous fatigue at the Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland since April 2nd, but unexpectedly took his own life. According to the hospital, Forrestal climbed out of the window of a neighboring room and jumped at 2:00 AM this morning. The hospital is over ten stories high, and Forrestal's room was on the top floor. Forrestal was born in Beacon, New York, in February 1892, and studied at Dartmouth College and Princeton University, working his way through school. During World War I, he joined the Navy as a private and transferred to the Air Force. In 1918, he joined the Navy General Staff. In 1940, he became Undersecretary of the Navy, and four years later, he succeeded Knox as Secretary of the Navy, making great contributions to the construction of a large navy. Forrestal embraced talent-ism, and sometimes removed naval generals from important positions and re-used civil servants. In 1947, the three departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force were merged, and Forrestal became Secretary of Defense, until he recently resigned. It is said that his nervous fatigue was caused by overwork during and after the war.

### The Philippine Representative to the Korean Commission Opposes American Troop Withdrawal

[Associated Press Seoul 22nd Dispatch] Philippine Representative Renna of the United Nations Korean Commission stated on the 22nd that his delegation firmly opposes the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea. Renna made the above statement at a luncheon hosted by the South Korean Foreign Minister. He was speaking on behalf of the Philippine delegation, not on behalf of the Korean Commission. Renna stated: "I oppose the withdrawal of American troops because the United Nations General Assembly's resolution on the Korean issue clearly states that the United States and the Soviet Union should withdraw their occupation forces simultaneously. As a member of the United Nations Korean Commission, I have always been denied entry into North Korea, so I cannot know whether the Soviet Union has already withdrawn its troops. Under these circumstances, I cannot agree that after the American troops withdraw, the Republic of Korea will be free from attack." The diplomatic community is not surprised by Renna's statement, as it is generally believed that the Philippine and Korean governments are working closely together on the proposed Pacific Pact. At the same time, both countries hope that the United States can assume the same obligations to the Atlantic region to support the Pacific region.

### American Newspaper Comments on Japanese Reparations: Allied Nations Should Abandon Demanding Reparations from Japan

[New American Agency, Washington, 18th] American newspapers are commenting on the issue of Japanese reparations, continuing to support the American policy announced last week by Major General McCoy, the U.S. representative to the Far Eastern Commission. The Washington Post said: "America's sudden and seemingly somewhat arbitrary action to cease demanding reparations from Japan coincides with the views expressed by the Herald Tribune as early as February 2, 1947. At that time, it was already clear that if the Allied nations could not agree on a method for claiming and distributing Japanese reparations, Japan would never be able to recover. The eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission has been in constant dispute over Japanese reparations since its establishment in 1945. The main disputant is, of course, the Soviet Union, which thoroughly plundered Manchuria, including Japanese industries there. This is the bill for the Soviet Union's one week of fighting in Manchuria, but Moscow refuses to disclose the names of the reparations it seized. In addition, there were other things obtained from Japan, totaling a reduction of 3 billion U.S. dollars in Japanese assets abroad. Regarding formal reparations, the claimant nations remain deadlocked, although the United States has repeatedly tried to break this impasse. Initially, any demands by the United States were criticized, followed by the shipment of some reparations items (including a certain amount of machinery) to some claimant nations as a preliminary solution to the reparations issue. However, the total amount of reparations and the method of distribution remain impossible to determine. Based on these and other reasons, there is an urgent need to resolve the entire reparations issue. In addition to occupation costs, the United States spends 300 to 400 million U.S. dollars annually on the Japanese economy to supply the Japanese people with essential goods. This subsidy creates a dependency mentality among the Japanese people that is difficult to remove and does not encourage Japan to try to become economically self-sufficient. Furthermore, removing more of Japan's productive equipment would only reduce Japan's ability to achieve economic self-sufficiency, which is a major goal of the occupation. Requiring the removal of Japanese production equipment to some claimant nations in the Far East may not be of much help to those countries either. The heavy industrial equipment that Japan has relatively "surplus" is very expensive to move, and is often useless without secondary processing equipment, which these claimant nations do not have. As for the light industrial equipment that they can use more easily, it cannot be considered surplus for Japan's peacetime needs if Japan is to support itself in world trade. Because Japan and Britain must import food and raw materials while exporting manufactured goods to pay for imports. Japan's economic recovery as a trading nation is beneficial not only for Japanese and American taxpayers but also for the entire Far East, because the recovery of Far Eastern trade can eliminate the current chaos and prevent the spread of communism." The Chicago Daily Tribune said: "This new policy is clearly correct and should have been adopted long ago... At a time when the world needs production, we are allowing production equipment to be dismantled, but the machinery will inevitably be damaged during relocation, and a great deal of production will be lost before new factories are established in new locations overseas, and there will be even more losses due to a lack of technical personnel to control the machinery... Our government has finally adopted a policy that should have been adopted long ago." The Indianapolis News declared: The U.S. central demand for reparations resolution "is based on strictly practical considerations." The newspaper cited the Far Eastern Commission's failure to agree on a reparations catalog, the U.S. subsidy to the Japanese economy, the division of reparations already taken by the Soviet Union in Manchuria, and the fact that reparations obtained by China would fall into the hands of the Communists. The newspaper added: "Unfortunately, the Philippines will also be deprived of reparations for Japan's wanton plunder and destruction. But according to a comment in the New York Times, even under these circumstances, "it is very clear: if the Philippines continues to be with the United States, which has been relieved of its burden to Japan, and occupies a sound position in a healthy Pacific economy (which must have a solvent Japan), then the Philippines will benefit more than from an economically distressed United States or a bankrupt Japan. Therefore, retaining the industry previously designated by Japan for reparations to the four countries means trying to make Japan economically self-sufficient as soon as possible. This is a sudden change in policy, but this change should be based on a sound principle: that the world must have a healthy society and a healthy economy if it is to enjoy democracy and peace." The Washington Daily News said: "There is a very good reason for ending the demand for reparations for war losses from Japan, and that is that the reparations that Japan will pay in the future will be taken out of the pockets of the United States, not paid by Japan. The Allied nations have already obtained a lot of compensation from Japan, and the burden we bear is also considerable. We can no longer pay the remaining reparations claims for Japan. No one can profit from war. The cost and destruction of huge wealth must be treated as a total loss. This is the situation in which we do not demand reparations from Japan. The question is how to establish an economy in the Pacific region that allows people to live their own lives and live with others, so as to prove that the salvation of mankind lies in peace, cooperation, rather than military, economic and political oppression.

### Today's Iran

Special Translation by Our Newspaper's Editorial Office

Since the lifting of the Berlin Blockade, the tense situation in Europe has gradually eased, and the world's attention has gradually shifted to Asia. Iran is an ancient country in the East, occupying a strategic position. Historically, it has long been a place of contention for foreign powers, and today it has become the focus of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the Western bloc. This article is translated and published for the benefit of our readers, so as to gain a general understanding of the importance of the Iranian issue.

The Cold War in Iran has existed since ancient times, not just today.

Iran is the richest country in the Middle East, with a 1,500-mile border with the Soviet Union. It is the bridgehead of the Persian Gulf, the entrance to the Suez Canal leading to the Indian Ocean, and the necessary route for Eastern merchants in ancient times. In its long history of 6,000 years, Iran has been constantly threatened by foreign invasions. Today, Iran is facing the pressure from the West in a world where the Atlantic and Soviet spheres of influence confront each other, and it is bravely and stubbornly maintaining its independence.

Soviet troops have occupied and then withdrawn, without establishing a permanent puppet government, which is only true of Iran in the world. This is due to Iran's political maneuvering and the moral pressure of the United Nations. But this has caused even more disputes.

An Iranian official explained Iran's diplomatic position, saying: "The United States' policy in the Middle East is what we are most worried about. Greece and Turkey have consolidated their positions with American military aid, which puts even more pressure on Iran."

However, Iran is situated between two major spheres of influence, always maintaining its independent position, and has never formally asked the United States to provide military guarantees. However, the Iranian government has hired American military missions to train its army and gendarmerie, and has obtained surplus supplies from the United States.

However, that military training mission has strengthened the threat of Soviet aggression and occupation. Iran has long been plagued by the hot and cold wars of successive Soviet governments. After the Soviet Communist Party came to power, it signed a treaty of friendship with Iran in 1921 to eradicate Tsarist aggression. But that treaty contained a provision stipulating that if White Russian counter-revolutionary troops gathered on Iranian soil, the Soviet government had the right to send troops into Iranian territory to take necessary self-defense measures.

The threat feared by the Lenin government disappeared, but the Soviets found that clause very convenient for implementing their policies. That clause was first used in 1941, when Soviet and British troops occupied Iran, using the country as a bridge for transporting lend-lease materials to the Soviet Union via the Persian Gulf.

In 1946, weeks after the United Nations deadline expired, Soviet troops were advised to withdraw from Iran, with the promise of oilfield concessions. They believed that a puppet government had been established in Azerbaijan Province, the largest province in Iran.

Unexpectedly, Iranian Prime Minister Sultani made a splash by sending troops to fight the pro-communist troops for a day, reoccupying Azerbaijan Province. At the same time, Sultani's hand-picked parliament unanimously voted to deny the promise to grant oilfield concessions to the Soviet Union. Now, the leaders of Azerbaijan Province who escaped the noose are under Soviet protection, while Soviet influence in Azerbaijan Province has declined to an unprecedented level.

When Soviet influence gradually recovered, it launched an offensive, accusing the American military training mission of trying to turn Iran into a strategic base threatening the Soviet Union. Soviet Ambassador to Iran, Sachinikov, submitted notes to the Iranian government on January 31, March 24, and April 8, 1948, stating that the Soviet Union believed that the 1921 Treaty of Friendship had been violated, and the Soviet government invoked the treaty to freely occupy Iran in order to protect its southern border. Iran refuted the Soviet accusations as "baseless," condemned its actions as "interference in Iran's internal affairs," and pointed out that the obligations of Iran and the Soviet Union under the United Nations Charter had invalidated the occupation provisions of the 1921 Treaty.

Since the threatening attacks from Moscow Radio, Iran's closure of Soviet consulates in various places, and the sporadic conflicts that occurred along the border, Iran's Cold War has become hotter day by day.

Tehran officials have warned against equating such trivial matters with major issues. Iran closed the Soviet consulates because the Soviet Union refused to grant reciprocal privileges. Border conflicts have been occurring continuously in sparsely populated deserts for fifty years.

Iran is watching the movements of the policies of the world powers, while Iran has its own problems, such as establishing domestic political unity and eliminating the country's extreme poverty, which need to be resolved.

### The Supply of Vegetables in Shanghai

[Special Article by Our Newspaper] In the morning, housewives or maids, carrying baskets to the vegetable market, ask about the prices of vegetables, and are surprised to say: Yesterday it was only so much money per catty, how is it so expensive today? When they meet their neighbors' little sisters, they also discuss the daily rise in prices. They can already hear the gunfire, but they are still so black-hearted. They know that the approaching gunfire is causing vegetable prices to rise, but what is the reason for this?

Shanghai is a large industrial and commercial metropolis, densely populated. Even if there are scattered open spaces, they are small in area, where there is land that can be used to grow vegetables and fruits. Commerce is based on industry, and industry is based on agriculture. Although Shanghai has developed into a metropolis with five to six million people, it is still inseparable from the countryside. The raw materials of factories are mostly agricultural products. The food for millions of citizens also depends on the countryside, and even the vegetables for meals must rely on the supply and transport from the countryside.

Shanghai has six million citizens. On average, each person consumes half a catty of vegetables a day, which requires 30,000 dan. Where do these 30,000 dan of vegetables come from? Most of them come from the neighboring counties of Shanghai, such as Huangdu, Pudong, Kunshan, Songjiang, Suzhou, Wuxi, Nantong, Pinghu, Hangzhou, and Ningbo. Vegetables are transported from these places to supply the consumption of Shanghai citizens. For example, green vegetables and snow vegetables come from Huangdu, yellow sprouts come from Chongming Beisha, cabbage is mostly from Pudong and Chongming, and potatoes also come from Huangdu, radishes are transported from Wuxi and Suzhou, and bamboo shoots from Hangzhou and Ningbo are also sources for Shanghai. Further afield, cabbage from Hebei and Shandong, garlic from the Northeast, and peas from Guangdong are also transported to Shanghai for supply.

In the past, the Old Zha Gate Bridge, the New Zha Gate Bridge, the Bund, Caojiadu, etc., were all distribution centers for vegetables. The shops on both sides were all local produce shops, and even the sidewalks on both sides of the road were used as temporary vegetable storage areas. Boats full of vegetables were transported from various places to Shanghai and concentrated there. Some were directly bought by the local produce shops, and some local produce shops acted as intermediaries, reselling to vegetable vendors and collecting a certain commission.

Before dawn every day, it was the most prosperous time for local produce shops to do business. It was bustling and noisy, and that was when vegetable vendors went to wholesale. Vegetables, baskets, rickshaws, rubber-wheeled carts, trucks, and self-propelled carts were squeezed together, bumping east and west. By seven or eight o'clock, people slowly decreased, and the noise gradually subsided. There was another market in the afternoon, which was sometimes more lively than in the morning, and that was when vegetable vendors were wholesaling for sale tomorrow. Because after vegetable vendors wholesale vegetables, they also have to select, sort, and trim them. The yellow leaves of green vegetables must be removed, although the weight is reduced by 20%, they can sell for more money. For fruits and the like, they must also be selected according to size, because their value is inconsistent. The basket of vegetables must also be sprinkled with some water to maintain its fresh color, so as not to sell for a low price tomorrow.

During the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, in order to achieve the goal of controlling the market and collecting materials, they were not willing to let go of even these agricultural products. The Central Market was established at the northern end of the New Garbage Bridge, divided into departments such as preserved meat, local produce, northern goods, eggs, medicinal materials, wine, Chinese paper, firewood and charcoal, fuel, and asphalt. Branch markets were set up in various places such as Maigen Road, Limalu in the Nanshi, Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai, Xie Bridge, Jiangwan, Pudong, and Tushanwan, to complete their control objectives, forcing the local produce shops in the area of ​​New Zha Gate Bridge and Old Zha Gate Bridge to do business there. Farmers were also forced to let the enemy control the harvest they had exchanged with their blood and sweat. The market charged 26% of the profits for transactions, which resulted in higher vegetable prices. After the victory, the Central Market, like other enemy and puppet organizations, was taken over by the municipal government. It was initially planned to improve it, continue to operate it, and rename it Shanghai Agricultural Products Market; however, it was suspended due to a proposal by the City Council. After the suspension, the local produce shops felt inconvenient to do business, so they established a Vegetable Transportation and Sales Joint Transportation Market to replace it.

The vegetables needed by Shanghai's six million citizens every day are not produced in Shanghai, but rely on the supply from other ports; therefore, transportation is the main task of maintaining the source. In peacetime, if it rains for several days in a row, or on days with heavy snow in winter, the arrival of goods is scarce, and the price of goods will also rise. As the war approaches Shanghai, the transportation lines to the outside world are reduced, the source of vegetables cannot be smooth, and supply falls short of demand, naturally prices will rise even higher. In the past few wars, although the currency value was still very stable, prices would also rise by two or three times. Now, on the one hand, the arrival of goods is scarce, and on the other hand, the currency value has fallen, how can prices not jump especially high?

In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when Shanghai was reduced to an isolated island, vegetables from various places could not be transported into the Shanghai urban area, and residents were greatly panicked. For a time, the Local Produce Industry Association chartered British tugboats to go to Gaoqiao, Nantong, and other places to purchase vegetables. Later, although transportation in various places gradually became connected, vegetables and other items were still not allowed to be transported into the urban area, resulting in low vegetable prices outside the barbed wire, allowing them to wither, while the prices in the urban area skyrocketed. Although many people were forced by life to take risks to transport them in, the cost was high, and the selling price would certainly not be low.

Shanghai citizens are now busy with grain, buying firewood, and storing preparations. Food is indeed a big problem, but it is not possible to have only rice without vegetables. Wealthy families have already prepared ham, canned food, etc., and ordinary families have also prepared a little salted yellow croaker. As for vegetables, because they are fresh goods, it is impossible to buy them in large quantities and store them. Although they are getting more expensive every day, housewives are worried about it, but there is nothing they can do.

### Planting the Seeds of Disaster: Eastern and Western Buddha Factions, The Inside Story of Fujian's Armed Clashes, Overseas Chinese Money Fuels the Fire

[Jinjiang News] Armed clashes, though not unique to southern Fujian, are widely known in that region. On the surface, southern Fujian has a long-standing reputation as a "Zou and Lu by the Sea," a famed land of flourishing culture. Its customs should not be barbaric. Moreover, situated on the coast, it has long enjoyed advanced transportation, and its people often engage in floating commerce, gaining broad experience and knowledge abroad. Logically, armed clashes stemming from barbarity and narrow-mindedness should not occur. Yet, southern Fujian stubbornly maintains armed clashes with centuries of history that have yet to be eliminated.

So, how do armed clashes originate?

Some say that while southern Fujian has long enjoyed external transportation, it remains essentially an agricultural society. In agricultural societies, people regard land as life, and the concept of boundaries is deeply ingrained. Moreover, they live in kinship groups, and the concepts of lineage, clans, and local factions are extremely strong. Armed clashes are a product of the interweaving of these two concepts. While this explanation has its merits, where in China has not been an agricultural society in recent decades? Why are armed clashes particularly rampant in southern Fujian? In reality, two main factors contribute to the armed clashes in southern Fujian: first, the "Eastern and Western Buddha" factions, and second, "overseas Chinese money" (remittances from overseas). Here, we will first introduce the "Eastern and Western Buddha" factions.

If the armed clashes of southern Fujian could be compiled into a "History of Armed Clashes," then the "Eastern and Western Buddha" factions would occupy a crucial position in this history. We certainly do not deny that many armed clashes originate from disputes between clans (surnames), but many armed clashes originate from the "Eastern and Western Buddha" factions, and even more armed clashes originate from clan disputes but are amplified by the "Eastern and Western Buddha" factions, adding fuel to the fire.

What exactly is "Eastern and Western Buddha" (a term rarely heard by outsiders)?

Let us retell an old folk legend.

During the early Qing Dynasty, Jinjiang had two prominent officials: Jinghai General Marquis Shi Lang and a Hanlin scholar (name unknown). That year, the Hanlin scholar's daughter married General Shi's son. General Shi, relying on his status as a renowned court general, deliberately wore the "Yellow Jacket" specially bestowed by the emperor when the Hanlin scholar visited him. This forced his father-in-law to kneel and pay homage to the emperor upon seeing the "Yellow Jacket." The Hanlin scholar was greatly displeased by this trickery. To return the favor, when General Shi returned the visit, the Hanlin scholar not only hung up the "Iron Nose" (a symbol of imperial authority granted during his brief tenure as "Temporary Ruler"), but also deliberately spread mud throughout the hall, forcing General Shi to kneel and pay homage to the emperor upon seeing the "Iron Nose," and the place where he knelt was filthy mud. Thus, in-laws became enemies. General Shi sought revenge but found it inconvenient to act himself, so he cleverly devised a plan, using small regional concepts and divine power to stir up trouble. The Hanlin scholar countered him using the same method. At that time, General Shi resided in "Fenchi Pu" in the east of the city, while the Hanlin scholar resided in "Fengsheng Pu" in the west of the city. They each actively sought friendly "Pu" (local administrative units), using divine power as a rallying cry. They allied themselves with the heads of friendly "Pu" (deities, disciples, shamans, and thugs), addressing them as brothers. The city's thirty-six "Pu" were divided into two camps, with "Fenchi" and "Fengsheng" as the leaders, known as "Eastern Buddha" and "Western Buddha." This spread from the "Pu" within the city to the villages outside the city, and from Jinjiang to various counties in southern Fujian, with almost no corner untouched. The sole purpose of the "Eastern and Western Buddha" factions was to hate each other and engage in armed clashes. Over two or three hundred years, countless blood was shed, countless lives were lost unjustly, and the animosity only deepened.

Some Ridiculous Examples

When a village with the surname Jia and a village with the surname Yi have a dispute, many other villages with the surnames Jia and Yi eagerly rush to help their respective clans, thus forming an armed clash.

When an "Eastern Buddha" "Pu" and a "Western Buddha" "Pu" have a dispute, many other "Eastern Buddha" and "Western Buddha" "Pu" and villages eagerly rush to help their respective "allies," thus also leading to an armed clash.

When a village with the surname Jia and a village with the surname Yi have a dispute, many other villages with the surnames Jia and Yi, as well as other "Eastern Buddha" or "Western Buddha" factions belonging to the Jia and Yi surnames, come to help their respective clans and allies, thus leading to an even larger armed clash.

This is how armed clashes are formed. However, the so-called "disputes" that trigger armed clashes are sometimes simply ridiculous rather than genuine disputes. The earliest armed clashes may indeed have arisen from fairly serious disputes, but later, the reasons for some armed clashes that we often hear about are less "disputes" and more stubborn stupidity, and are in fact extremely vague traditional concepts.

Here are some ridiculous examples:

A person from village Jia passed through village Yi. Because it was hot, he stopped to rest in the shade of a tree. A child from village Yi swatted a fly on his back. The person, thinking the child was being playful, slapped him lightly. The child cried, so village Yi beat gongs and lined up weapons to resist village Jia. This actually escalated into a large-scale armed clash.

A child from village Jia was grazing cattle. The ignorant cow accidentally stretched its head across the boundary to eat a mouthful of grass from village Yi. Village Yi not only kidnapped the cow or the shepherd, but also initiated negotiations. Coincidentally, village Jia also refused to show weakness, so they actually resorted to armed clashes.

When the "Eastern Buddha" procession was parading their gods, due to the winding alleys, someone accidentally stepped over the boundary line of the neighboring "Western Buddha." The "Western Buddha," who had been watching and monitoring, rushed over, not only beating people but also attempting to destroy the divine palanquin or regalia. After a brawl, a formal armed clash ensued.

Although the names of the places and villages involved in these incidents cannot be recalled due to the passage of time, they certainly occurred. A reporter once spoke with an elementary school student from a village who was enthusiastically talking about the armed clashes between their village and another village. The reporter asked, "Why did you start an armed clash with Village X for no reason? Why are you children so enthusiastic about armed clashes?" The child replied, "Village X is our enemy. Our grandfather said, 'Don't spare anyone from Village X.'"

Who is Fueling the Armed Clashes?

Why can't armed clashes be eliminated?

The answer is: Some people are fueling armed clashes in tangible and intangible ways.

Southern Fujian's progress is too slow. This means that the remaining feudal forces stubbornly persist in southern Fujian society. Despite the relatively widespread and developed culture and education (referring to newspapers and schools) over the past twenty years, the transformative effect of instilling new customs has been small. In today's society, people still talk about clans and local factions everywhere. However, this slow social progress is not the only reason for fueling armed clashes, although it is one of the reasons. (To be continued)

### Legal Clarifications

...Answered by Lawyer Jiang Pingfan...

[Question from Yu Yinlai] I rented a house from someone two years ago for a deposit of one million yuan, with a two-year contract stating that the house would be returned upon expiration and the deposit would be fully refunded, with a signed lease as proof. The contract expired in March of this year, and the person ordered me to move out. I have two questions for clarification.

[Answer] (1) For fixed-term leases of two years or less, the landlord may not request termination of the lease on this basis, even if the term has expired. If the landlord requests to take back the house for personal use, they must provide concrete proof and notify the tenant of the termination of the lease three months in advance. (2) The deposit paid by the tenant at the time of renting the house, if the lease clearly states that it will be fully refunded upon returning the house, should be bound by this special agreement and cannot be claimed based on the price of rice.

[Question from Shen Yuying] My father, Jia, took over a bathhouse in Shanghai in 1932. Later, when the Shanghai War broke out, he locked up the house and fled back to his hometown with his family, without leaving anyone to look after it. Yesterday, I passed by the place and saw that the shop had been taken over and operated by a stranger named Yi. Upon investigation, the property rights of the shop belong solely to my father, and the contract documents from when he took over the shop, as well as all relevant documents regarding water, electricity, and the house, are stored in my possession. I would like to ask: (1) Based on the above situation, since Yi did not obtain Jia's consent or permission and brazenly occupied the shop, has he committed the crime of encroachment? (2) Can Jia legally demand that Yi return the shop and recover the property? (3) If Yi refuses to comply, what procedures can Jia follow? (4) Since my father lives far away in the old capital and is of advanced age and unable to travel, can I, as his child, act as his agent to exercise his rights?

[Answer] (1) If Jia can prove that he had previously obtained the lease rights to the house and the operating rights to the bathhouse, it can be presumed that Yi is unlawfully infringing upon the rights of others. (2) Jia can remove Yi's infringement and demand that he move out. (3) If Yi refuses, the only option is to file a lawsuit to remove the infringement and return the house and shop. (4) Because Jia is elderly, he can entrust his son to negotiate on his behalf.

### Visiting the Wuri Sugar Factory in Taiwan

— Yi Ping

The Wuri Sugar Factory is one of the dozens of sugar factories under the Taiwan Sugar Corporation. Its predecessor was the Wuri Sugar Factory of the Japan Sugar Industry Co., Ltd., with a capital of 2.25 million Japanese yen. Its initial name was the Taichung Sugar Co., Ltd. Later, it acquired the Fanshejiao Sugar Company and the Chitang Factory, jointly operated by Temuzhuangzao and Liao Huanwen. Its initial crushing capacity was only 350 tons. In May 1921, it merged with Toyo Sugar Co., Ltd. and planned to build a new-style factory, increasing its crushing capacity to 450 English tons. Later, the areas of Shekou and Dingzai, where the original Chitang Factory was located, were incorporated. In December 1927, it was merged into the Japan Sugar Industry Co., Ltd. After the retrocession, it was operated by the Sugar Corporation, under the jurisdiction of the First Branch. The scale of the Wuri Sugar Factory is quite large. Under the factory director, there is a General Affairs Department, divided into sections for documents, personnel, administration, purchasing, materials, finished products, operations, and medical affairs; an Accounting Department, divided into sections for accounting, costing, and auditing; an Engineering Department, divided into sections for sugar making, machinery, and chemical testing; an Agricultural Department, divided into sections for raw materials, farms, land, and weighing; and a Railway Department, divided into sections for mechanical affairs, track maintenance, and transportation. In addition, there is also an Employee Promotion Association. The employees not only have rich experience and skilled skills but are also quite cooperative and hardworking. Therefore, production is steadily increasing.

In terms of increasing raw material production, the factory had only 300-odd hectares of sugarcane fields in the 1945-1946 period. This was because during the war, the Japanese allowed sugarcane land to be freely abandoned and converted to rice cultivation to supply military grain. After the takeover, the factory encouraged farmers to plant sugarcane seedlings. However, many farmers remained hesitant and waited to see. Later, the factory repeatedly sent personnel to various townships to promote and persuade them, and also conducted surveys of planting areas. At the same time, the sugar sharing method was implemented. Later, the ratio was increased from 52 to 48 to a 50-50 split. As a result, the benefits for farmers increased, which was incomparable to the exploitation by the Japanese in the past. Farmers flocked to grow sugarcane, and the area of sugarcane fields gradually expanded. In the 1947-1948 period, it had increased to more than 1,071.46 hectares. It is estimated that the planting area in the 1948-1949 period will reach 1,660.81 hectares.

The factory spares no effort to improve agricultural facilities, such as water conservancy development, variety selection, and pest and disease control. As for land, the situation is particularly complex due to different policies during the Japanese era. After years of active consolidation, it has gradually become organized and is handling the leasing of public land in accordance with provincial orders. Furthermore, on July 1, 1948, the Beitunghu Sugarcane Specialized Cooperative Farm was established, which can increase raw material production and help unemployed farmers, greatly benefiting the rural economy. Currently, the factory has a total of nine raw material zones and three self-operated farms.

Next, let's talk about the factory's crushing capacity and sugar production. The factory suffered little damage during the war. Although it was bombed twice, neither bomb detonated. However, due to years of disrepair, various equipment needed to be overhauled. After the takeover, the factory actively started restoration work. After more than a year of effort, equipment such as cane unloaders, cane conveyors, shredders, crushers, cylinders, boilers, heating tanks, evaporation tanks, crystallizers, and centrifuges have been repaired and completed. During the 1945-1946 sugar production period, the raw material was insufficient, and the factory had not yet been fully repaired, so all the harvested raw material was transported to the Taichung Sugar Factory for crushing. In the 1947-1948 period, due to the abundance of raw materials and the gradual completion of various machines, all employees were excited. The factory buildings, machine parts, and air pipes were all painted, giving them a brand-new look. Crushing began in January 1948 and lasted only two months. Second-grade white granulated sugar was produced using the lime method, with a crushing capacity of 800 tons and power generation of 176 kW.

The factory originally operated its own railway, including the Shuikutou, Shekou, and Dingdai lines, with a total length of 53 kilometers. It had five locomotives, 260 sugarcane cars, and 280 platform cars. The lines were distributed in various raw material areas to transport raw materials and supplies. However, during the takeover period, none of the lines were complete. The sleepers were corroded, or the bridges were damaged. Later, in accordance with the railway development plan, restoration was carried out on a scheduled basis. Currently, the Shuikutou, Shekou lines, and the Lincuo transportation line have all been completed. The repair of locomotives, the renovation of sugarcane cars, the refurbishment of road signs, and the painting of vehicles are also being actively carried out. However, the factory's railway lines mostly run through the Wuxi and Maoluo Rivers in central Taiwan, so many bridges must be built. During the rainy season, they are often washed away. Therefore, they are only built before the sugar production period and dismantled after the sugar production period, resulting in the factory having these temporary projects every year. Furthermore, the Typhoon Gloria in June last year damaged the main bridge of the Feizi River, which was repaired by contractors. This project was completed and opened to traffic at the end of December last year, preventing the transportation operations of this period from being affected and enabling production to be increased as scheduled.

In order to encourage employees' work enthusiasm and help them stabilize their lives, the factory attaches great importance to employee welfare facilities, such as the payment of education subsidies for children and living subsidies, and the establishment of consumer cooperatives. Other facilities such as medical rooms, libraries, barber shops, bathhouses, and sports fields are also well-equipped. In addition, a welfare farm is established near the factory site to sow rice and open vegetable gardens.

Since April 1, 1947, an Employee Promotion Association has been established. After the management of all employee welfare undertakings of the factory was transferred to the association, the results have been even more remarkable, such as organizing tour groups to visit scenic spots in batches, organizing the first sports meeting, and holding infant health competitions. In order to promote the mental and physical development of employees and to harmonize relationships and eliminate barriers, two Mandarin Chinese training classes were also held, and a Mandarin Chinese speech competition was also held, with outstanding results.

After the retrocession, the Wuri Sugar Factory spent a lot of time reorganizing equipment and repairing equipment. Crushing only started in January last year, but the results were no less than those of other sugar factories. Currently, the factory is working hard to promote its original goals, with particular emphasis on agricultural reform, increased raw material production, reduced costs, improved technology, improved quality, and the utilization of by-products, in order to actively increase production.

### Authorities Investigate Banks and Firms Regarding Silver Dollar Payouts

Severe Punishment for Secretly Obtaining

[East China News Agency] National banks have resumed issuing silver dollars to commercial banks and firms. All industries can withdraw silver dollars daily at posted rates through commercial banks and firms. In order to prevent some banks and firms from using excuses to avoid payouts, the authorities require each bank and firm to submit a list of their total deposit amount and their silver coin inventory to the national bank for record-keeping at the end of each business day. The proportion of silver dollars to be paid out to customers the next day will be based on the ratio of the previous day's silver dollar inventory, plus the number of silver dollars that can be obtained from the national bank that day, to the total deposit amount. This must be publicly displayed in the bank for everyone to know. Starting today, relevant authorities will conduct strict investigations. Any illegal banks or firms secretly obtaining silver dollars without providing them to customers will be severely punished by the Garrison Headquarters in accordance with martial law.

### Brief Sunny Breaks During Minor Fullness; Sunshine Expected Tomorrow

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday's weather in the city was the worst seen this month. Heavy clouds and low pressure were only about 1,000 feet above ground. Thunder, lightning, and showers at around 5:00 AM disturbed people's sleep. Afterwards, there was drizzling rain, sometimes stopping and sometimes falling. Although the rain stopped and the clouds cleared briefly at noon, with sunshine, it was very short-lived, and the sky quickly became overcast again. The walls and floors indoors were also unusually damp. According to the Meteorological Observatory, since the beginning of this month, Pacific air currents and mainland air currents have been meeting in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, creating a low-pressure phenomenon with intermittent sunshine and rain. This is the "Minor Fullness" climate before the "Winter Solstice." Since yesterday, the wind direction has changed to a moderate northerly to northeasterly wind, possibly due to a high-pressure system appearing over the Sea of Japan. The weather today will still be overcast, but the cloud cover is expected to rise to 3,000 to 6,000 feet, which should help our brave air force. Sunshine may be seen tomorrow, depending on whether there is a change in wind direction. However, it will take some time for long-term sunny weather to arrive.

### Suburban District Offices Move to Downtown Areas

[Public News Agency] Due to the impact of the war, the various district offices in the suburbs of the city are unable to operate in their original jurisdictions, so they have all moved to the downtown area.

### Major Fire in Nanshi Yesterday Morning

Zhou Zhaoxiang, Director of the Municipal Police Department's Fire Department, and Ye Binyong, Chief of the Fire Brigade, personally went to direct the rescue. Fire engines from the Central District Fire Brigade and the Hubei South District Volunteer Fire Brigade were dispatched to assist in the rescue.

### Many Marriages in Chaotic Times; Residents Busy Moving

[Public News Agency] Due to the intensifying war, most citizens feel that family reunions are uncertain, so if sons and daughters have not yet married, they rush to get married. However, because of these extraordinary times, everything is simplified. Most weddings are done without ceremonies, with only the parents of both sides stamping their seals on the marriage certificate. Also, yesterday, residents in the Gaochang Temple area of Nanshi, feeling the loud cannon fire, moved to the city center, causing moving tricycles to be constantly seen on the streets and alleys all day.

### Campaign to Comfort the Troops: Citizens Enthusiastically Donate; Excellent Broadcast Programs Continue Today

[Central News Agency] Since the Shanghai Comfort Association launched its campaign to comfort the troops, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 AM, the Shanghai Radio Station's telephone lines have been constantly busy with citizens responding by pledging to donate silver dollars, U.S. dollars, gold yuan certificates, food, towels, rubber shoes, shirts, etc. Some have even donated white rice, expensive wines, and cigarettes, in considerable quantities. This shows the citizens' enthusiasm for comforting the brave soldiers on the front lines. The statistics are now being compiled, and members of the Postal Association have been dispatched to collect the donations separately. Today is the second day of the association's fundraising broadcast, with programs including Shanghai ballad singing, Yangzhou opera, Huai opera, and Yue opera, with all the famous Shanghai actors participating.

### Chairman Fang's Broadcast Speech

[Central News Agency] During yesterday's fundraising broadcast to comfort the troops, Mayor Chen, Commander Chen, and the association's Chairman Fang Zhi all gave speeches. Excerpts from Chairman Fang's speech, "The Communists are Digging Their Own Graves in Shanghai," are as follows:

Unleashing True Power

Judging from the Nationalist army's war results in Wusong and Pudong, the Communists are really nothing special. Haven't we all heard? The Communists previously announced on the radio that they would attack Shanghai on the 15th and occupy Shanghai on the 17th, but today's Shanghai is still safe and sound. This proves that the Communist propaganda is completely deceptive. As long as all the elders and folks in our city unite and do not panic or be afraid, the defense of Shanghai will surely win the final victory. We must know that defending Shanghai is defending China. If we cannot eliminate the Communists in Shanghai, there is nowhere else to eliminate them. In the past, the Nationalist army withdrew entirely for strategic reasons, but now it has reached the point where the Nationalist army can no longer tolerate it and is truly unleashing its power, which is also the beginning of eliminating the main Communist forces.

The Nationalist army is fighting in Shanghai not only to fight for the independence of the nation, but also to protect the lives and property of our city's six million citizens. Therefore, we, the people, must work together with one heart and one mind, and mobilize all financial and material resources to support the front lines. Under the premise that everything is for the front lines, everything is for the soldiers, and everything is for suppressing the Communists, we hope that our compatriots will recognize the importance of the defense war and respond with the greatest enthusiasm. For the campaign to comfort the troops launched by the Comfort Association today, we certainly do not need everyone to go to the front lines to fight, but donating money and goods to comfort the troops is encouraging the soldiers at the front.

Enthusiastically Comfort the Soldiers

Regarding donations of comfort items from all sectors, they can be sent to the Social Bureau's Comfort Association, and funds can be sent to the Shanghai Municipal Bank and its branches. After collecting these funds and materials, the Comfort Association will immediately distribute them to the soldiers at the front, in accordance with the hopes of all compatriots.

Compatriots, in addition to enthusiastically comforting the soldiers at the front, to fulfill each person's contribution and conscience to the country, at the same time, we should also fulfill our responsibility as citizens to stabilize the local area, because there are still a few conspirators within the city who are trying to take advantage of the situation to sabotage, disrupt, and harass. We must mercilessly strike at these traitors and Communist spies and thoroughly eliminate them in order to ensure safety. Now the Songhu Garrison Headquarters has established a method to reward people for reporting Communist spies, and we hope that everyone will pay attention and work together. I would like to appeal with the greatest sincerity to all compatriots who share life and death and share weal and woe: we must save the country and save ourselves, we must do everything for the front lines, everything for the soldiers, do our best to donate, and closely report and eliminate Communist spies.

In addition, recently, refugees in the suburbs have been displaced and suffered greatly due to the war. Commander Tang is extremely concerned about this situation and is actively urging the authorities to step up efforts to provide relief so that the refugees can have food and shelter without worry. However, during this tense time of war, we can only grit our teeth and endure all hardships in order to strive for the protection of freedom and democracy and the victory of the defense war. As long as our city's six million citizens unite and mobilize, we will be able to suppress the Communists and make Shanghai a place where the Communists dig their own graves.

### Seven Rice Stores in Longhua District Reported for Embezzling Rationed Rice; Bought Ration Coupons from Residents at Low Prices; Tao Guanjin and Zhang Xiuyu Detained

Seven designated rice stores in Caoxing Town, Longhua District, colluded with personnel handling the distribution of registered rice households in the district, purchased ration coupons, altered and signed coupons, and embezzled for profit, which was discovered by citizens who reported it to Mayor Chen. The city government has sent personnel to verify the facts and has detained the relevant criminals, Tao Guanjin and Zhang Xiuyu, and is continuing to pursue other accomplices. It is reported that according to regulations, the third installment of household rationed rice for April in Longhua District should have been completed by May 10. Because Qibao, Meilong, and Xinzhuang in the district were close to the front lines, the rationed rice could not be transported. The price of rice in the city gradually increased, and the difference in ration prices became larger. The seven designated rice stores in Caoxing Town – Gongxing, Luohesheng, Binda, Wantai, Gongda, Qinji, and Zhanglongshun – purchased ration coupons at low prices to offset their accounts with the Civil Food Allocation Office, claiming to the public that the rationed rice had been sold out, causing most residents near Caoxing Town to be unable to purchase it. Later, Zhou Qiusheng, the owner of Qiu Ji Rice Store on Guanshengyuan Road in Longhua District, stepped forward out of righteous indignation to publicly report the crime. It is reported that Wang, a committee member of the Sixth Supervisory District of the Civil Food Allocation Office, verbally notified Tao Guanjin, an employee of Gongxing Rice Store acting as an agent for rice merchant Wang Yinsong in Longhua District on the morning of May 11 at the Longhua District Office, instructing him to immediately notify the designated rice stores to collect ration coupons first, and submit them to the bank along with the rice money on the 11th, and then reissue them after the rationed rice arrived that afternoon to appease public anger. In addition to carrying out Wang's instructions, Tao Guanjin purchased 45 ration coupons from residents such as Zhang Jinfu and purchased 225 catties of rice from Zhanglongshun and other seven rice stores at an average price of 100,000 yuan per coupon. He also received instructions from Li Youlun, an employee of the Civil Food Allocation Office, stating that the quantity of ordinary rationed rice did not match the quantity of key rationed rice for teachers and civil servants, and instructed the rice stores to alter and sign the coupons. Zhang Xiuyu, the owner of Zhanglongshun Rice Store in the district, received the third installment of household rice for April on May 8 and then purchased 20 ration coupons with 50 catties of rice from A Mao, a servant of Xiang Ruichang, a resident of the district. He also purchased ration coupons for another 150 catties of rice from others and refused to distribute it, claiming that the rice was sold out, so he illegally purchased 307 catties of household rice privately, which has been seized by the Longhua District Police Bureau. In addition, Yang Jigen and Xue Yuchun, the directors of Wantai and Luohesheng rice stores in the district, illegally purchased ration coupons.

To Seek Huge Profits

It is heard that Tao Guanjin and Zhang Xiuyu have been detained by the Municipal Police Bureau and have admitted to the embezzlement. In order to rectify discipline and severely punish corruption, Mayor Chen decided to thoroughly investigate the personnel involved in the embezzlement case, deal with them severely according to the law, and investigate whether similar incidents have occurred in the district's past rice distribution to ensure that rice distribution truly benefits the residents. Zhou Qiusheng, the owner of Qiu Ji Rice Store who came forward to report the crime, is commendable for his courage, and the authorities will give him a special reward.

### Eight Parishes in Xujiahui Shelter Refugees: Over 3,000 People; Over 500 Already Housed; Lack of Fuel Makes Cooking Difficult

[Our Newspaper] According to the Catholic Education Advancement Association, in the past two weeks, the eight central areas of the Catholic Church in Xujiahui, including the Tushanwan Male Orphanage, the Sacred Heart Female Orphanage, the Shanghai Diocesan Seminary, and the Xujiahui Observatory, have sheltered 3,200 refugees who have fled to Shanghai from rural areas within a range of 10 to 20 miles southwest of Shanghai. Xu Zonghai, the priest of St. Ignatius Cathedral, has also allocated his school buildings and priests' residences entirely to them, so the housing problem for more than 500 of these refugees has been solved. Most of these refugees brought one or two bags of rice with them when they came to Shanghai, but they are struggling to cook because of the lack of fuel.

### Chongqing Transportation and Public Utilities Ordered to Charge in Gold Yuan Certificates

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] Various public and private industries here have been pricing in silver dollars one after another, while the government's payments are in Gold Yuan Certificates, leading to repeated disputes. The Governor's Office has now specially stipulated two measures: (1) Various transportation and public utility agencies can use the silver dollar price as a reference for calculating their costs in order to maintain their normal operations. (2) Various transportation and public utility agencies shall uniformly charge in Gold Yuan Certificates from now on. If there is forced collection of silver dollars, people are allowed to report it, and they will be severely punished.

### Cholera, Typhoid Fever, and Dysentery are the Most Common Infectious Diseases in the City; Summer is Coming, and Epidemic Prevention Work is Urgently Needed

[Our Newspaper] The flames of war are burning in the suburbs of Shanghai, a large number of refugees are pouring into the city, the population is soaring, and everyone is listening to the sound of cannons in a small world, living together, and it is difficult to take care of environmental hygiene. As summer approaches, epidemic prevention will be one of the most urgent tasks.

The main infectious diseases that have been prevalent in Shanghai over the years include smallpox, cholera, typhoid fever, dysentery, and meningitis. Among them, cholera, typhoid fever, and dysentery are the most common in summer. The reason for this is mostly due to foodborne infections. In addition, humidity and mosquitoes are also closely related to the spread of diseases. Regarding humidity, according to research, the prevalence of cholera is related to the absolute humidity in the area. As far as Shanghai is concerned, cholera will not prevail when the humidity reaches below 10 hectopascals of mercury. At present, it is not possible to artificially change the temperature, but if we can pay attention to environmental hygiene and personal health, the impact of temperature on the body's resistance can also be reduced to a very low limit. For example, getting more rest, and having a regular diet and sleep, can all strengthen the body's resistance to diseases.

Drinking Water from Dug Wells Should Be Disinfected

In terms of prevention, in addition to receiving vaccinations, the cleanliness of drinking water should be paid the most attention. According to a survey of cholera cases in Shanghai in 1946 and 1947, the results found that many cases were caused by drinking water from earthen wells. At present, many neighborhoods have dug earthen wells, and special attention should be paid to disinfection when using them. In addition, attention should also be paid to the treatment of feces and sewage. The general public should be vigilant together, not drinking raw water, and not eating melon, fruit, and food sprinkled with raw water, so that germs cannot be transmitted.

Unclean Melons and Fruits are Disease Vectors

Unclean melons, fruits, beverages, and popsicles on the market in summer are vectors of disease. Last year, the Health Bureau tested popsicles sold on the street, and the results showed that 99% were unqualified, and only one or two were qualified. The situation is the same for those "frozen sodas" made by vendors themselves. Although the authorities have stepped up crackdowns on these unclean drinks, drinkers drink them, and when they get sick, they have already suffered deeply. Therefore, citizens should be vigilant and not buy and eat them casually. In addition, the work of eliminating flies and mosquitoes should also be promoted. DDT is a very effective agent invented in recent years, and citizens can generally spray and disinfect their residences to the extent that they can afford it.

Inability to Obtain Nutrition Greatly Reduces Resistance

The Chinese old saying goes, after a great war, there will be an epidemic. However, due to the pressure of life, the general middle and lower class citizens have no energy to pay attention to nutrition, and their body resistance is greatly reduced, and diseases can easily enter. Furthermore, due to financial difficulties, they also feel powerless to use medicine. Therefore, if an infectious disease occurs, it will spread like wildfire and be difficult to extinguish. Therefore, if an epidemic occurs in Shanghai this summer, the situation will be quite terrible. Epidemic prevention is already a matter of urgent importance.

Epidemic Prevention is Like Fire Prevention; It Should Be a Joint Effort

The Municipal Health Authority should be responsible for leading the way to the extent possible, but epidemic prevention is not something that the authorities or citizens alone can do well. There must be the planned guidance and economic strength of the health authorities, plus the cooperation of all the citizens of the city, in order to succeed. Epidemic prevention is like fire prevention; it is useless to only take care of yourself. If an epidemic prevails, the personal safety will also be at stake, so epidemic prevention must be planned, organized, and targeted. Doing it together within the scope of our ability, although it cannot be said that it can absolutely prevent the occurrence of epidemics, at least it can alleviate much.

Today, Donghua defeated the Railway team 2-1, and Qingbai drew with the Railway team 3-3. In the final battle, the winner will be crowned champion. Qingbai must win and cannot lose.
