### Li Zongren, Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, etc., Discuss Ways to Peace Talks; Bai Chongxi Invites Zhang Qun to Hankou for Observation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch] Since the President issued his message calling for peace, although the Communist Party has yet to issue a formal response, several key government officials who are working for peace, such as Vice President Li Zongren, Political Committee members Zhang Zhizhong and Zhang Qun, and National Policy Advisor Shao Lizi, have been in contact daily to discuss ways to move toward peace talks and achieve the goal of peace. It is not yet possible to ascertain what stage their research and efforts have reached, but it is believed that they must be studying a concrete plan, which is expected to be implemented only after the Communist Party issues a formal response. Several sources in the capital learned on the 6th of the New China News Agency's commentary on the President's message. Although the commentary directly criticized the message, its purely propagandistic tone made it difficult to regard as a formal response from the Chinese Communist Party. As of the 6th, all parties here were still awaiting a response. Government spokesman Shen Changhuan also stated on the 6th, in response to reporters' inquiries, that the government has not yet received a formal or informal response from the Communist Party regarding President Chiang's message. As for the issue of international mediation, it is also clearly a focus of attention, but American, Chinese, and Soviet figures in Nanjing are maintaining a silent attitude. A reporter asked Shen Changhuan whether any government officials had requested the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, or France, or any one of them, to come forward to mediate. Shen's response was: "To the best of my knowledge, no government official has made such contact." When asked whether any private individuals had made such contact, Shen stated that he did not have a comprehensive intelligence network sufficient to know of such private actions. According to Shen's response, the government has apparently not yet sent anyone to contact international friends. This may be a possible second step, but it will also have to wait for the Communist Party's response to determine whether or not to proceed.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Bai Chongxi has recently been in close contact with some people in the central government in Nanjing on the issue of the current situation, using long-distance telephone calls. The person with whom he has been in constant contact is Vice President Li. Bai had a telephone conversation with Zhang Qun in Nanjing on the 5th, inviting him to go to Hankou. It is said that Bai's intention is to ask Zhang to observe the actual situation and dispel the doubts of the general public about him. As for whether Zhang will go immediately, it is said that he is still considering it.

[United Press, Beiping Dispatch, 6th] The general public here believes that 1949 will be a year of peace for China, with only the most pessimistic believing that it will not be achieved until after June. However, no one dares to say that it will not require significant difficulties. Before President Chiang's New Year's message suggestion evolves into full peace, there will be many necessary procedures. Currently, public organizations are telegraphing to support the peace movement and advise the CCP leader Mao Zedong to order a ceasefire.

[United Press, New York, 6th] The New York Times stated in an editorial on the 6th: Although President Chiang's peace terms have been rejected by the Communist Party, these peace terms are only President Chiang's first offer, and the Communist Party's rejection has only been transmitted by the Communist Party's propaganda organs and does not come from the CCP leadership itself. Therefore, there is much room for negotiations and compromise between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The editorial concluded: The current peace depends on whether the Communist Party can listen to the people's demands for peace.

### Local Public Opinion Organs Continue to Call for Peace; National Representatives and Supervisory Committee Members from the Northeast Prepare to Form a Self-Salvation Association

The Wuhan City Council responded to the President's New Year's message, telegraphing to the central government and both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to cease fire immediately, and hoping that the Communist Party would send representatives to conduct peace talks as soon as possible.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 6th] Zhang Michuan and more than fifty national representatives from Hubei Province and Wuhan City telegraphed the central government and the Communist Party on the 6th, calling for peace to relieve the people's suffering.

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 6th] The council responded to the President's message on the 6th, telegraphing to urge the Chinese Communist Party to cease fire.

[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 6th] More than a hundred organizations, including the Three Principles of the People Knowledge and Action Society, telegraphed the President today in support of his peace message. They also telegraphed the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, asking them to prioritize the country and the nation and lay down their arms as soon as possible to hold peace talks.

[Our Jiangdu Dispatch, 6th] The county temporary council resolved on the 6th to telegraph all county councils, supporting the President's New Year's message, advocating for peace, and responding to the Hubei Provincial Council's telegram, requesting a stop to conscription and the construction of city defense works.

### Central Committee Member Liu Jianxu Talks About His Views on Striving for Peace

[Central News Agency, Changsha Dispatch, 6th] Central Committee member Liu Jianxu published his views on striving for peace, stating briefly: The President's New Year's message has opened the door to peace. Not only are the people extremely pleased, but international friends should also pin boundless hopes on China's imminent end to its fate of suffering. Historically, there has never been a war that did not end in peace. From a humanitarian perspective, the tragedy of mutual slaughter should be stopped immediately. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party have a history of cooperation twice. After the victory, they even jointly signed a program for peaceful national construction. Although the situation has changed today, the basic principles of the Three Principles of the People are still applicable to China. As long as both sides can openly and honestly discuss conditions based on these basic principles, there is no reason why peace cannot be achieved. What we hope for today is not only a fair and lasting peace, but also that everyone can deeply reflect on themselves, start anew, realize the Three Principles of the People, and create blessings for future generations to make up for today's trauma.

The plan is the result of the previous symposium, which was drafted by Huang Shao-gu et al. The most important aspect of the reform plan is the reform of the party's structure.

### Disguised as a Civilian, Breaks Through the Heavy Siege; Sun Yuanliang Escapes Danger and Arrives in Hankou; Endures Hardships, Takes Twenty-Nine Days to Reach Xinyang; Accompanied by Zhang Zhen to Hankou to Visit Commander-in-Chief Bai

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 6th] Sun Yuanliang, Commander of the 16th Army Corps, safely arrived in Xinyang on the 3rd. On the evening of the 5th, he was accompanied by Zhang Zhen, Chairman of Henan Province, from Xinyang to Hankou. He immediately went to the Suppression Headquarters to visit Commander-in-Chief Bai, reported the circumstances of his escape, and attended the Suppression Headquarters dinner, leaving at 11 o'clock in the evening, so few outsiders knew about it. This reporter visited Mr. Sun at his residence this morning. Mr. Sun was wearing a newly made military uniform, and although he looked slightly tired, he was in high spirits. According to him, after the army corps was surrounded by Chen Yi's Guangdong-Guangxi Column and other units at the beginning of last month, supply became seriously difficult. Although the soldiers' will to fight was strong, they had no way to feed themselves and had to kill livestock to fill their stomachs. Almost all of the army's warhorses had been eaten, and some soldiers had even starved to death. Fighting in this state of starvation for three or four days, the Communist army suffered heavy losses. Eventually, their ammunition ran out and there was no support, and the morale of the army could not be controlled, and they inevitably dispersed sporadically. Seeing that there was nothing he could do, he had no choice but to disguise himself as a civilian and break through the heavy encirclement from the Yongcheng position in northern Anhui on the 7th of last month. In addition to personally leading more than a thousand officers and soldiers who have safely arrived in southern Henan, most of the remaining subordinates have also been concentrated in favorable areas and are currently preparing to continue their efforts. I took the road through the Yellow River flood area in Henan and traveled through Xuchang to Xinyang, taking a total of twenty-nine days. It was not until 9:00 am on the 3rd that I saw my comrades again in Xinyang. I am currently telegraphing to Nanjing to report and will fly to Nanjing for instructions as soon as I receive a reply. After speaking, the guard told him that the car was ready. Mr. Sun said to the reporter, "I have to go to the Suppression Headquarters now. We'll talk again later."

According to Chairman Zhang Zhen, General Sun had endured great hardships during this escape. When he first arrived in Xinyang, he was wearing plain clothes and had a full beard. He first spoke to Chief of Staff Xi of the Fifth Pacification District and immediately sent a car to welcome him into the city to meet with me (Zhang referring to himself) and I gave him 5,000 yuan for the cost of a new uniform. After arriving in Hankou, Commander-in-Chief Bai praised Sun for his bravery and steadfastness and expressed his deep condolences on behalf of the central government.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The news that General Sun Yuanliang had escaped danger and arrived in Xinyang and then went to Hankou was confirmed by Deng Wenyi, spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, on the 6th. Deng said: Mr. Sun led his troops to break through the encirclement, and his troops have reached a safe area.

### Lu Dangping, Jiang Dangyi, etc., Arrive in Hankou to Visit Commander-in-Chief Bai

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 6th] Lu Dangping, a member of the Central Committee, and Zhu Wenyin, a local dignitary from Hunan Province, arrived in Hankou from Hunan last night. The two went to the Suppression Headquarters together this morning to visit Commander-in-Chief Bai and had lunch with Bai at his residence. General Sun Yuanliang and Chairman Zhang Zhen, who had recently arrived in Hankou, were also present. In addition, Jiang Dangyi, the military leader of a certain army, also arrived in Hankou from Hunan on the 6th.

### Deng Wenyi Officially Confirms That Liu Bocheng Was Indeed Killed in the Bombing; Five Other Bandit Army Generals Also Died

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The rumor that Liu Bocheng, commander of the Communist bandit "Central Plains Liberation Army," was killed in an airstrike while commanding the battle in northern Anhui was officially confirmed by Deng Wenyi, spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, on the 6th. Deng announced while hosting reporters: Liu Bocheng was killed on the morning of the 13th of last month in a concentrated bombing by a group of B24 aircraft in Taoyuanpu, northern Anhui. At the time, Liu was commanding the bandit army to attack Huang Wei's army corps in Shuangduiji. He and five other senior generals were traveling in one small car and two jeep army vehicles to the front line to command. They were hit by bombs, and the five generals were killed on the spot. Their names have not yet been determined. Liu had one leg blown off and was injured in the abdomen. He died on the way back. Bandits in Suixi, Suxian, Zhengzhou, and other places held a memorial meeting on the 18th, and the value of the banknotes issued by the pseudo-Zhongzhou Town Office in Zhengzhou plummeted as a result. Liu's death has been confirmed by military intelligence, prisoner confessions, and local residents' accounts. The bandit army purchased a coffin with 30 dan of wheat for Liu's body and buried it in Dongpingji, northeast of Taoyuanji. Deng also said: "After bandit Liu's death, his troops were commanded by his subordinate Chen Geng. Because of Liu Bocheng's death, the bandits entrenched in central China have temporarily taken a defensive position because there is no one to lead them. Liu Bocheng was an outstanding military leader in the bandit army. He had been in the military for more than 30 years and had received military training in the Soviet Union and Germany. His combat style was known for its cunning." (Note: Chen Geng and Deng Wenyi were classmates at the Whampoa Military Academy 25 years ago).

### US Officials Remain Silent on Marine Corps Plans in China; President of Shandong University and Others Host Farewell Banquet for Brigadier General Rupertus

[United Press, City Dispatch] Officials are remaining silent about the plans of the US Marine Corps in China, but evidence of their preparation to withdraw is gradually increasing. It is generally believed that a formal statement will be issued by the US State Department. United Press reporters from Qingdao claim that the Marine Corps are hastily packing their equipment, but Commander of the Western Pacific Fleet Rupertus refused to elaborate on his statement on the 4th that the US military will not withdraw from China. Shandong University will hand over the school on the 25th. The 3,000 US troops stationed at the school will return to their ships, and a portion will likely return to Guam.

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 6th] Zhao Taimou, President of Shandong University, Li Daifang, Speaker of the Provincial Council, and Cui Shijie, a member of the Legislative Yuan, hosted a banquet at the International Club this afternoon for Rupertus, Commander of the Western Pacific Fleet, and Thomas, Commander of the Marine Corps, to express their gratitude for the assistance provided by the US Navy and Marine Corps to Qingdao City in the past. Liu Anqi, Gong Xuesui, and other leaders were also invited to attend. The US Western Pacific Military Broadcasting Station has temporarily suspended broadcasting.

### Zhang Qun Analyzes the Current Situation and Advocates Taking Two Steps to Open the Door to Peace Talks; Encourages Middle Forces to Engage in Mediation

[Our Dispatch] Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the China Democratic Socialist Party, analyzed the current situation yesterday, saying that it is not easy to resume peace talks. There are currently two steps that should be taken first to open the door to peace talks. One is to lift the ban on speech. Since the suppression of the rebellion, any pro-peace remarks have violated the law, making it impossible for those who are willing to do their best to start. Now that the government has sincerely sought peace, this ban should be lifted immediately so that people from all walks of life who are willing to work for peace can mobilize their forces, form a middle force, and mediate between the two parties. Only then is there hope for peace. The second is to restore certain "routes" of contact with the CCP to clarify the other party's true intentions. For example, Zhang Dongsun recently expressed his willingness to go south to mediate, and the government should encourage him. Regarding the issue of the CCP's sincerity for peace, Zhang believes that there may be differences of opinion within the CCP regarding peace and war, so there is no formal response to the President's message. However, the CCP is a political party that has close relations with world politics, and its actions have their own proportions. Moreover, in judging the situation, although it currently has a temporary advantage militarily, it does not have the strength to sweep the country, so it may also be appropriate to stop. As for the leaders of the CCP, Zhang firmly believes that Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, and others are inclined towards peace and can take care of the interests of the country. As for the talk of mediation by the four countries, Zhang said that he had heard people promoting it in the United States last autumn, but he did not get the gist of it. As for whether the proposal for mediation by the United Nations can be implemented, it depends on whether China's internal affairs constitute an international dispute. Of course, the India-Pakistan war was mediated by the United Nations, but India and Pakistan are indeed two countries, which is very different from the current situation in China, so the hope of resolving the situation through the United Nations is minimal.

[Another Dispatch] Xia Taosheng, a member of the Standing Committee of the China Youth Party, visited Zhang Junmai yesterday afternoon to exchange views on the peace issue.

### Shanghai-Beiping Civilian Aviation Resumes Yesterday; A China National Aviation Corporation Plane Arrives in Beiping and Takes Away Thirty-Six People; Treasures from the Palace Museum and the Library Are Transported Out of Beiping

The Ministry of Education will no longer send special planes for professors to leave. Professors going south will take civilian planes and leave Beiping one after another.

### Bandits in the Suburbs of Beiping Are Constructing Fortifications; Fighting Intensifies Around Tianjin; National Army Withdraws from the Huidui Stronghold in the Southern Suburbs

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] Military news: Communist bandits are constructing fortifications in the suburbs of Beiping, seemingly attempting to besiege Beiping. The authorities are actively trying to solve the food problem and are airlifting flour to Beiping, which is expected to begin soon. Prices are rising and the value of gold and silver is fluctuating sharply.

The fighting was fierce. The bandits are still confronting the National Army in Huidui.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 6th] After a fierce artillery battle broke out in the four suburbs of Tianjin on the night of the 5th, the daytime on the 6th was relatively quiet.

A fierce battle broke out outside Xiyingmen, west of Tianjin, after 5:00 pm.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin Dispatch, 6th] Tianjin Garrison Headquarters News: The bandits, in order to invade Tianjin, are inhuman and unscrupulous. In addition to using human wave tactics to attack our Huidui, they are wantonly setting fire to civilians' homes. After our officers and soldiers put out the fires, they are gradually being extinguished. The number of civilians burned to death is being investigated. The bandit army's artillery is constantly bombarding the No. 4 Cotton Mill, the No. 1 Steel Plant, and nearby civilians' homes, causing huge losses to local residents.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin Dispatch, 6th] The Tianjin Garrison Headquarters announced: The battle on the Huidui front in the south of Tianjin ended at 12:00 noon on the 6th. After our army resisted heroically and inflicted heavy blows on the enemy, the defending troops were ordered to end the battle at 12:00 noon on the 6th and actively moved to the city defense line. The military authorities have provided appropriate arrangements for the heroic officers and soldiers who defended the area and fought hard for two days and nights.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin Dispatch, 6th] Since the fierce battle broke out in the suburbs of Tianjin on the 4th, the artillery fire has become more intense on the night of the 5th. According to the announcement of the Political Work Department of the Garrison Headquarters: On the night of the 4th, the bandits of the 1st Division of the 1st Column were repelled on our Dayuan Village stronghold on the west side of Tianjin. On the night of the 5th, they gathered the remnants of the bandits again and approached the stronghold, triggering more than a dozen landmines, killing and wounding more than 160 bandits. After suffering this blow, the bandits used artillery to bombard our positions, disregarding humanity and firing tear gas, launching a fierce attack on us. Eight soldiers guarding our front-line bunkers were poisoned and killed.

[Central News Agency, Beiping Dispatch, 6th] The North China Suppression Headquarters announced on the 6th: The National Army in Tanggu continues to maintain mobility and strengthen fortifications. Beitang and Xinhe are both under the control of the National Army.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 5th] Our powerful naval fleet has achieved major victories in the Tanggu-Dagu area in the past three weeks. Whenever the bandits attacked from outer strongholds such as Xinhe, Xichang Village, and Xiaojiadao, the ships would bombard them with fierce artillery fire, killing many bandits. On the 26th of last month, the bandits held a cadre meeting in Daliangzi and were discovered and bombarded by one of our gunboats. According to reliable information, in addition to killing many of their cadres, the commander of one bandit division and the commander of one bandit regiment were also killed.

The ancient city of Guzhen, about 70 li north of Lai'an County on the east side of the railway, was completely recovered at 11:00 am on the 6th under the strong pressure of a certain unit of Yang Gancai's army. The town was the old nest of the Communist bandits' New Fourth Army, and is currently occupied by the Lianghuai Independent Brigade and the 34th Brigade. The local bandits who have been harassing northern Jiangsu all use this as their base.

[Another Dispatch] Sutang (on the border between Dingyuan and Dongbian), the old nest of Sun Chuanjia and Li Yu's bandit troops on the west side of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, was completely captured at dawn on the 6th under the command of Zhou Weilong, the railway protection commander, with the railway protection troops cooperating with the National Army.

### A Brief Summary of the Week's War Situation Released by the Ministry of National Defense

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The Ministry of National Defense recently released a summary of the war situation for the week of December 30, 1948, to January 5, 1949, as follows: Due to the severe cold weather this week, there were no major battles on any of the national battlefields. However, the national army's air force and artillery have exerted their power, inflicting great casualties on the bandits. A brief summary of the war situation in various regions is as follows:

(1) In the Pingjin Area: The bandit army has been adjusting its deployment this week, and there have been no major battles. Two-thirds of Lin Biao's main force, approximately eight columns, have concentrated around Tianjin. The focus of recent battles may shift to the outskirts of Tianjin. In the Beiping area: Rongzhen's bandit forces are being successively transferred from the PingSui and PingHan lines to the vicinity of Beiping. Only the Fifth and Eleventh Columns of Lin Biao's forces remain in the ancient suburbs, and there have been no major battles recently. The national army in Tanggu has been launching attacks daily, achieving many gains. According to front-line reports, Zhan Caifang, the commander of the Ninth Column of the bandits, convened a cadre meeting in the Daliangzi area west of Xidagu on the morning of the 30th. It was struck by our naval artillery fire, causing many casualties among the bandit's senior cadres. Those who have been confirmed dead include Zeng Liyu, the commander of the 25th Division of the Ninth Column of the bandits; Chief of Staff Shuai Zijun; Political Commissar Jiang Honghai; Jin Li, the commander of the 26th Division; Chief of Staff Wu Wenhua; and Political Commissar Li Zhenchun. The search for bodies is continuing.

(2) In the Taiyuan Area: The bandits entrenched outside Taiyuan are demoralized due to their repeated failures in battle. Taking advantage of the bandits' fatigue, the national army launched a local offensive against the bandits during the New Year, killing more than 800 bandits in the areas of Yinjia Fort, Houjiang, Ganjiapeng, Heituo, and south of Baijiazhuang, and destroying dozens of bandit fortifications. The national army in Taiyuan is becoming stronger in battle, and the surrounding bandit army no longer dares to risk attacking. The national army in Datong has also launched search and suppression operations in all directions this week, killing more than 700 bandits. There are currently no traces of bandits within 40 li of the outer perimeter of Datong.

(3) In the Jianghuai Area: After the Battle of SuBeng concluded, the national army immediately made strong deployments along the Huai River. Chen and Liu's bandit forces suffered heavy losses and are currently unable to advance south. Liu's columns are resting and reorganizing in the area north and south of Sixian, while the majority of Chen's forces are in the northwest of Xikou, in a stalemate with our Du Yuming Corps. The national army has ample supplies of food and ammunition, and morale is high, while the bandit army is hungry and cold, in a very difficult situation. Currently, Chen's columns are only relying on deep fortifications to block our army from advancing south. There have been no major battles this week, except for sporadic engagements. The New Second Column of Chen's bandits, who roamed around the Hongze Lake, Xuyi, and Tianchang areas, has been severely suppressed by the national army in recent days, suffering more than 1,000 casualties. The remnants of the bandits have fled in a northeast direction, and the national army has entered Tianchang a few days ago.

In addition, the various battlefields in Northwest China were very quiet this week. After Liu's Tenth Column and Kong Congzhou's bandit forces, who had entrenched themselves in Fancheng, were defeated by our army, they fled to Xiangyin Town and other places. The bandits' plan to harass the Xiangfan area has been crushed by our army.

Since the President issued a proclamation on New Year's Day, calling for peace with the bandits, the war-weariness of the lower-level cadres and soldiers of the bandit army has become more pronounced than before. If the bandit leaders do not realize their mistakes and repent, and stop the rebellion, the day will eventually come when their subordinates will automatically cease fighting. The people of the country can wait and see.

Commentary

### A New Dawn for Xinjiang

Of the current border policies, the Xinjiang issue is the most noteworthy, and the evolution and development of the Xinjiang situation are most relevant to the overall domestic situation. In recent years, the Xinjiang issue has become increasingly complex, with ethnic, religious, political, and international factors intertwined, leading to multiple disturbances and disputes. Especially since the Baitashan incident, the Xinjiang situation has suddenly become serious. Thanks to the patience and adaptability of Northwest Administrative Director General Zhang Zhizhong and the calm handling of Xinjiang Province Chairman Mesut, the tense atmosphere in Xinjiang has been transformed into peace, thus stabilizing the Northwest situation. Recently, in order to reconcile internal opinions in Xinjiang and promote the unity of Xinjiang nationalities, the central government appointed Burhan as the Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, Muhammad Amin as the Vice Chairman, and Liu Mengchun as the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government. The former Chairman Mesut and Secretary-General Isa were dismissed and await further assignments, and the former Committee Member and Vice Chairman Abdul Kerim Khan Mahsut was dismissed from his concurrent position. Burhan and Amin are currently in Dihua and have expressed their acceptance of the new appointments. Liu Mengchun has also arrived in Dihua to arrange everything and has held talks with the Soviet Consul General stationed in Dihua. This indicates a major change in Xinjiang's administration, which will bring a new dawn for our country's peaceful and unified future.

The Xinjiang situation is complex and confusing, especially since the special status of the Ili, Tacheng, and Altai regions and the continuous creation of ethnic divisions by a few separatists have led to increasing instability in Xinjiang. Mesut's appointment as Chairman of Xinjiang not only failed to ease the internal contradictions among the Xinjiang nationalities, but on the contrary, provided various excuses for the Ili separatists. Last year's disturbances in the Altai region and the Baitashan incident were planned and instigated by the separatists to resist the government. In this chaotic situation, Zhang Zhizhong and Mesut's attitude of adapting to the situation was to be open and fair, to seek understanding among nationalities and religions through tolerance, and to seek political and international harmony through enlightenment. One only needs to look at the Xinjiang Provincial Government's inaction against the Ili three regions and Zhang Zhizhong's many letters to the separatists explaining the great righteousness to know that the government's enlightened and tolerant policy has gradually succeeded and has had a significant effect.

The first manifestation of this in fact is that Burhan, a member of the National Government from Xinjiang, and Amin, the director of the Xinjiang Provincial Construction Department, went south to report on their work, expressing the sincerity of the Uyghur people to turn inward. Burhan is a wise man of the Uyghur people, who studied in Europe in his early years and has extensive writings. He enjoys high prestige among the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, and even the Ili separatists respect him. Burhan and Amin brought the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe from Xinjiang, which was acclaimed in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. The overflowing unity and songs still make people in the mainland nostalgic. They also brought a "Xinjiang Construction Five-Year Plan" from Xinjiang, requesting financial and human assistance from the central government and various parties, which has won the support and sympathy of people from all walks of life. The second manifestation of this in fact is the election and establishment of the Xinjiang county councils and the election of local administrative officials in various counties, cities, and administrative commissioner districts. The Uyghur, Kazakh, and other ethnic groups have all enthusiastically participated. Mesut upheld the principle of fairness and carefully guided the election affairs throughout the province, which has won the goodwill of people throughout the province. This event symbolizes that the majority of ethnic groups and religious people in Xinjiang support the national policy and the central government, and further demonstrates that under the central government's patient and firm determination leadership, the complex and chaotic Xinjiang is moving towards democracy in politics and unity in ethnicity, and is finally able to obtain stable factors. This is a major achievement of Xinjiang's politics in the past year, laying the foundation for peace and happiness for Xinjiang and the Northwest.

This time, the central government appointed Burhan and Amin to preside over Xinjiang, and appointed Liu Mengchun, Zhang Zhizhong's think tank, to assist in the provincial administration of the new province. This shows that the central government has made further efforts and attaches greater importance to the future of peace and unity in Xinjiang. First, Burhan and Amin are determined and have plans for the economic construction of Xinjiang. The major problem in Xinjiang today is still the economic problem. The resources are unexploited, the people's wealth and income cannot be increased, and the ideal living standard cannot be established. If the construction of people's livelihood can be successful in Xinjiang, then the stability of Xinjiang will be beneficial to the future of the nation and the country. Second, Burhan has prestige in the new province. He is upright and open in his work and studies, and has no partisan background, which is deeply supported by the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. This time, Burhan has received a good response from the general public for accepting this new appointment. Burhan also stated in his leisure life in Dihua that "the future of Xinjiang is very optimistic," which shows that the confrontational stalemate in the Ili three regions is expected to be broken soon, and Burhan is confident in the peace and unity of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Based on these two points, we should celebrate the bright future of Xinjiang in advance, and celebrate the future of national unity in advance.

In short, the Xinjiang issue has gradually become clear. Political development is moving towards democracy, and economic development is moving towards construction, which will help stabilize the Xinjiang situation. The stability of Xinjiang will naturally eliminate internal contradictions and external temptations. All this depends on the efforts of Burhan and others. On the one hand, we celebrate the bright future of Xinjiang, and at the same time, we must call for the vigilance of a few separatists in Ili, Tacheng, and Altai. The door to peace and unity in Xinjiang has been opened, and they should quickly return to reason and return to the road of peace and unity!

### The Crisis of a New World War is Increasing China will be the Main Battlefield Western Countries Can Win After a Long Struggle Reported by Fang En of the Associated Press

[Fang En, Director of the Far East Branch of the Associated Press, Tokyo, 6th] The conquest of most of Northeast and North China by the Chinese Communist army has changed the entire strategic situation in the Western Pacific and East Asia. Non-communist military and political figures in these two regions share this sentiment.

In the past twelve months, the author has visited almost all of Asia and met with local leaders and European and American leaders. They generally believe that the danger of a new world war being triggered in Asia is increasing. The same omens as when Japan conquered the Northeast and Japanese warlords stepped into the Chinese mainland in 1931-33 have begun to appear. The position of the Chinese Communist army and Moscow on the issue of war and peace in the Western Pacific is exactly the same as the position of Tokyo in the Pearl Harbor incident.

The obvious possibility of war between the Western allies led by Britain and the United States and the communist countries led by the Soviet Union can already be seen. However, the most well-informed observers do not believe that this great war will break out immediately. They emphasize that the Soviet Union is not currently preparing for a major war and may not be ready for several years. It is generally believed that China will immediately become the main battlefield. The Soviet Union has already won the first round in China. The Northeast has actually become a satellite state of the Soviet Union, and Outer Mongolia and North China are rushing into the Soviet sphere. Some qualified British and American observers believe that Asia is the main goal of the Soviet Union in the current "cold war." The Soviet Union's aggressive tactics in Berlin and other parts of Western Europe are to cover up other real major offensives in the Far East. It is generally recalled that the Soviet Union clearly stated as early as 1924 that it intended to pull China into the Soviet bloc.

At that time, the Soviet Union sent a large military and political advisory group to assist Sun Yat-sen's national revolution. They also pointed out that the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party were the people who began to accept communist ideas at that time. The current confrontation is shaped as follows. The Allies control the Japanese archipelago south to Taiwan, Okinawa, and the Philippines. In Southeast Asia, they control India and its neighboring islands, including the Dutch East Indies and Ceylon. The status of democratic countries in Burma and Indonesia is not strong. Britain has not yet completely suppressed the communist rebellion in Malaya. The Soviet Union and its communist allies now control Siberia in Northwest Asia and islands that can see Alaska, as well as the Kuril Islands south to Sakhalin Island, which is only separated from the northern tip of Japan by a strip of water. North Korea, the Northeast, Outer Mongolia, and most of North China are under Soviet control. In addition, it also has strong positions in the former Japanese bases in southern Sakhalin and Xinjiang. In the areas controlled by the Western Allies, there are stronger land, sea, and air bases. The Western Allies may have superior naval supremacy, excluding submarines, and also have an advantage in air supremacy. There is no doubt that the Soviet Union's land forces are extremely dominant and may occupy several areas currently occupied by the Western Allies and hold them for some time. In addition, the Soviet Union has no atomic bombs and its industrial productivity is far behind the West. The general opinion is that if war occurs in the future, Western countries can win, but only after a long struggle that consumes their strength and resources.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] At today's press conference, Deng Wenyi, Director of the Political Work Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, answered the following questions from foreign journalists regarding news and telecommunications inspections: (Q) Has the Chinese government started inspecting news and telecommunications sent abroad? If it has not yet started, does the government intend to implement this inspection? If so, when will it start? Which agency is currently implementing or will implement this inspection? What special laws are the implementation of telecommunications inspections based on? If telecommunications inspections have been implemented or are planned, is the scope of inspection limited to military or political news? Or must both be inspected together?

This spot check method has already been implemented in some areas. As for whether news and telecommunications should be subject to this spot check, the relevant authorities are carefully and sympathetically considering this point. The government is willing to continue to ensure the free transmission of news and telecommunications before making a final decision. If the government decides to implement spot checks on news and telecommunications, it will notify the newspapers and news agencies in advance. I can also assure you that in the event that inspections are implemented, the government is willing to carry out spot checks with the utmost prudence and convenience, so as not to cause delays and inconvenience.

### Second Half of the 37th Year: National Treasury Revenue and Expenditure Closure Handled; Executive Yuan Instructs Subordinates to Comply

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The second half of the 37th year has already ended. Due to currency reform, the various supplementary budgets for the second half of the year could not be approved, and tax revenues from various revenue agencies were not remitted to the national treasury by the end of December. The Executive Yuan's advances also failed to complete the legislative process as scheduled. As a result, all revenue and expenditure, as well as receivables and payables, could not be finalized. The Executive Yuan, based on the joint request from the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the Ministry of Finance, in order to handle the situation with flexibility and to prevent the discrepancy between national treasury revenue and expenditure and the preliminary and final accounts from becoming too large, approved the "Measures for Closing National Treasury Revenue and Expenditure for the Second Half of the 37th Year" drafted by the two ministries. It has instructed all subordinate ministries and commissions, as well as provincial and municipal governments, to implement them. The details of the measures are as follows:

(1) In accordance with the Central Government's general budget for the second half of the 37th year, for supplementary budgets and funds advanced by the Executive Yuan to ministries that have not been fully disbursed by the end of the second half of the year, the Ministry of Finance may issue payment orders before the end of January of the 38th year. The national treasury shall disburse the funds before February 20th, and they shall still be treated as expenditures for the second half of the 37th year. For funds that remain undisbursed after the deadline but are still required by various agencies, transfer procedures for the fiscal year should be handled in accordance with Article 54 of the Budget Law.

(2) For national treasury revenue in the second half of the 37th year, funds deposited and transferred to various agencies by the 20th, general operating expense deposits may continue to be used until the end of February. Any remaining unused funds after the deadline shall be returned to the general revenue deposit for the 38th year by the respective governments, and a statement of receipts and disbursements of the general operating expense deposit balance shall be prepared and submitted to the district sub-treasury, which will forward it to the national treasury general treasury and the Ministry of Finance for verification.

(3) Any remaining funds from various expenditures that are managed independently by various agencies shall be remitted to the nearest national treasury by the end of February of the 38th year, and included in the general revenue deposit for the 38th year, and reported to the Ministry of Finance for verification.

(4) For public treasury checks issued by various agencies from their general operating expense deposits in the second half of the 37th year, which are remitted from location A to location B and still used within the national treasury, the provisions of Article 2 of these measures shall apply.

(5) For various fund deposits, except for construction funds and other funds which shall be handled according to the procedures for general operating expense deposits as stipulated in Articles 2, 3, and 4, any unused portion by the end of February of the 38th year shall be added to the funds for use in the 38th year.

(6) For funds advanced by the Executive Yuan to ministries and those approved to offset expenditures with revenues, if the legislative process has not been completed by the end of the second half of the 37th year, the responsible agency shall prepare a preliminary budget before January 10th of the 38th year, or the Executive Yuan shall prepare a preliminary budget on their behalf, and forward it for approval.

(8) For funds that were receivable but not paid in the second half of the 37th year, those paid before the end of February of the 38th year shall still be treated as revenue for the second half of the 37th year. Those paid after the deadline shall be treated as revenue for the 38th year.

(9) These measures shall be implemented after being approved by the Executive Yuan.

### Essentials of Conscription During the Period of Suppression of Rebellion; Ministry of National Defense Formulated to Be Implemented from New Year's Day

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of National Defense believes that the implementation of military service laws during the emergency of suppressing the rebellion has not achieved the desired effect. To ensure that laws align with reality, simplify administration, and facilitate the people, the Ministry has formulated the "Essentials of Conscription During the Period of Suppression of Rebellion." These will be uniformly implemented nationwide from January 1st of the 38th year. The full text of the essentials is as follows:

A. General Principles Article 1: These essentials are formulated to meet the needs of suppressing the rebellion, strengthen basic-level military service work, implement "teach before war," and achieve "lean military and simple administration."

Article 2: The purpose of these essentials is to flexibly apply existing military service laws, reduce practical difficulties, facilitate the people, and ensure the combat effectiveness of the national army.

B. Conscription Article 3: County (city) conscription is subject to the command, supervision, and assessment of the garrison district. The county (city) magistrate, concurrently serving as the commander of the self-defense corps, shall be fully responsible and will be subject to stricter performance reviews. The implementation principles are as follows: (1) The county (city) government's military affairs section (unit) shall handle the military service administration and conscription processing and planning. (2) Each county (city) shall have the self-defense corps handle the organization, training, and management of conscriptible draftees, and the county (city) magistrate shall select one additional deputy commander from among the officers in the villages to assist in the process. (3) The county (city) self-defense corps shall organize all able-bodied men aged twenty to twenty-five (the age range may be extended if necessary) into conscriptible units, based on township (district), conduct background investigations in accordance with the conscription processing rules, create detailed rosters, accurately track them, and prepare them for conscription at any time. (4) The county (city) government shall establish a conscription center during the conscription period, with the commander and deputy commander of the self-defense corps concurrently serving as the director and deputy director of the center. Based on the garrison district's conscription orders, the required number of conscriptible draftees shall be gathered from the conscriptible units within a deadline of ten days. (5) The conscriptible draftees gathered at the county (city) conscription center shall be organized by township (district). The management may be handled by locally stationed officers and soldiers from the regular self-defense force and security team, with appropriate allowances. Leaders shall be elected from among the draftees by township (district) to assist in management and family communication. (6) The county (city) military service association shall be responsible for military service supervision, publicity, preferential treatment for conscript families, and shall operate in accordance with the regulations for the organization of military service associations. Township (town) branches of the military service association may also be established as needed, and their organization and tasks shall be determined by the county (city) military service association.

Article 4: The allocation of conscription quotas shall be based on the county (city) as the allocation unit, and the bao as the basic-level allocation unit. The principles are as follows: (1) The central allocation to each province (city) and the allocation to each county (city) shall be based on population ratio, but may be appropriately increased or decreased based on security, border defense, and industrial conditions. (2) The allocation of each county (city) to each township (town) (district) and the allocation of each township (town) (district) to each bao shall be based on population or able-bodied men ratio. (3) If the local security situation in each province is likely to change, each province may, with the aim of not delaying the conscription quota, appropriately allocate a reserve quota after reporting for approval for adjustment purposes. (4) The able-bodied men required for local security and guard duties shall be allocated according to the principles in the preceding two paragraphs, without affecting the regular conscription quota.

Article 5: The implementation of conscription shall be based on the county (city) as the conscription unit and the township (town) (district) as the basic-level conscription unit. The principles are as follows: (1) The background investigation of conscriptible draftees in the township (town) (district) shall be completed before the beginning of each year. At the same time, households shall be classified into two-son households, three-son households, or four-son and five-son households, etc. (by analogy), and their organization shall be completed, ready for conscription at any time. The term "number of sons in the household" refers to the number of fathers, sons, siblings, and relatives living together, aged eighteen to forty-five. (2) Based on the prescribed conscription quota, the township (town) (district) shall collect conscriptible draftees from the conscriptible units of each township (town) (district) and conscript by bao according to the quota for each bao. (3) After the conscriptible draftees from each bao are gathered in the township (town) (district), the township (town) (district) chief, together with the bao chief, shall be responsible for accurately conducting a background re-investigation and preliminary physical assessment of the draftees. Once the number of qualified individuals is sufficient, they shall be sent to the county (city) conscription center. (4) When the conscriptible draftees from each township (town) (district) arrive at the county (city) conscription center, a physical examination shall be conducted immediately. After passing the examination, they shall be handed over to the new recruit team of the division or garrison district in accordance with regulations.

Article 6: The principles for selecting conscriptible draftees during the implementation of conscription are as follows: (1) The selection of conscriptible draftees shall be carried out in accordance with the conscription processing rules and lottery methods. (2) In areas where household registration control has not been effectively implemented, the following methods may be adopted depending on the circumstances: 1. In rural baos, the township (town) (district) government shall be responsible for conducting lotteries, selecting draftees primarily from households with multiple sons, according to the quota for each bao. If there are draftees who volunteer to be conscripted first, they may be selected first. 2. In urban baos and general households, the district government shall be responsible for conducting lotteries in the same way as in rural baos. For companies, firms, factories, institutions, schools, and military agencies and units, excluding those with active-duty personnel and those who are exempt or deferred, the organization shall be used as the lottery target, and draftees shall be selected according to the proportion of conscriptible draftees. 3. If conscriptible draftees in the above-mentioned organizations also have the status of general households, the organization where they are located shall be used as the standard.

Article 7: The scope of deferment and postponement of conscription shall be narrowed, and the methods shall be determined separately.

Article 8: The principles for conscription processing procedures and application submission procedures during conscription are as follows: (1) Background investigations and lotteries shall be the responsibility of the township (town) (district) and shall be carried out separately before conscription. Physical examinations and conscription shall be carried out by the county (city) before handing over to the new recruit team of the garrison district. (2) When conscriptible units implement conscription, if the draftee is the one who drew the lot or volunteered, their parents (head of household) and family members eligible for preferential treatment shall fill out a "Application for Enlistment Guarantee" (as per the attached form). If the draftee is from an organization, the person in charge of the organization and their family members eligible for preferential treatment shall fill it out. If there are no family members, the bao chief shall be the guarantor. (3) The above-mentioned application for enlistment guarantee shall be submitted along with the conscriptible draftee. After the handover of the draftees, the county (city) government shall retain it.

Article 9: If volunteer soldiers can be recruited locally, and they can raise some usable weapons, and the cadres are competent to fight in the suppression of the rebellion, they may be recruited after reporting to the Ministry of National Defense for approval, without affecting the regular conscription conditions.

Article 10: The navy, air force, special forces, specialized soldiers, and units with good local relationships in certain areas may recruit after reporting to the Ministry of National Defense. (To be continued)

### Truman to Submit Special Message; Elucidating US Foreign Policy; Situation in Our Country to Be Reviewed with Concern; Expanding Military Aid Abroad Program; Establishing Anti-Communist Bulwark

[United Press, Washington, 6th] Diplomatic authorities here announced today that President Truman will likely deliver an important statement on foreign policy within two weeks, reviewing the situation in China and its impact on the US defense strategy in the Eastern Pacific. In addition, he will report on the situation in Indonesia and Palestine, which the government has been quite concerned about for months. The statement will be issued at the latest by the inauguration ceremony on the 20th of next month, but it may also be delivered earlier, in the form of a special message to Congress. In yesterday's internal policy message, he only briefly mentioned foreign affairs. The upcoming statement will elaborate on the entire policy scope formulated by the State Department, the Department of Defense, and the Economic Cooperation Administration. There are two entirely new plans in the drafting stage: joining the North Atlantic Military Alliance to establish an anti-communist bulwark until the Western European countries are able to resist the Soviet Union on their own, and expanding the military aid abroad program to authorize the President to supply arms to the Western European countries, thereby accelerating their military build-up and providing them with a full sense of security. In addition, the President is expected to request an extension of the European Recovery Program for three years, provide further assistance to Greece and Turkey, and continue to adopt a firm stance against the Soviet Union.

[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] In his first message to Congress on the 5th, President Truman only made a brief and theoretical statement on the key points of the "Truman Doctrine" in terms of foreign policy. The President promised to elaborate on his foreign policy in another message in the future, stating today only: "We are pursuing a foreign policy that is an outward expression of our people's democratic beliefs. We are striving to encourage free nations and free people around the world to help those who are suffering and in distress abroad, and to strengthen democratic countries to resist aggression. The core of our foreign policy is peace. We support the United Nations in maintaining peace, and we adopt world economic policies to promote human prosperity. We are guided by the principle of international cooperation. Because of this concept, we bear a national obligation that is as profound as anything, and we will use our resources and honor to give it effect until a world security system that we can confidently rely on is established. We cannot now avoid the burden of maintaining military forces sufficient to deter aggression. We made great progress last year in effectively organizing our armed forces, but there is still a need for improvement in our national security legislation. Universal military training is extremely important to the security of the United States. During this session, I will have the opportunity to ask Congress to consider a number of measures in the area of foreign policy."

### America's Massive New Budget Proposal; Truman to Submit to Congress Next Monday; Expenditure Figures Will Reach 43 Billion US Dollars

[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] Republicans attacked Truman's campaign promises and legislative plans on the 6th, claiming that the government's economy was being neglected and the nation would go bankrupt as a result. Mr. Du will submit to Congress next Monday a budget for expenditures for the year beginning July 1. Associated Press has learned that if the new budget proposal is still calculated on the basis of the past, the expenditure figure will reach 43 billion US dollars.

Truman estimated a year ago that the expenditure figure for the current fiscal year would be 37.7 billion US dollars. The actual government expenditure for last year was 42.5 billion and 5 million US dollars, so the new figure is clearly higher than before. The agency had to ask for increased taxes, which both Democratic and Republican members feared to hear.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th] President Truman consulted extensively with Treasury Secretary Snyder and government financial experts and Democratic leaders in Congress this morning, making final revisions to the budget message he will read to Congress. The message will outline the 1949-50 budget proposal.

### US Senate Committees; Under Democratic Control; Vandenberg Complains

[US Information Service, Washington, 5th] The selection of Democratic senators to be placed on the fifteen standing committees of the Senate was announced today, showing that the Democrats in this session of Congress occupy the majority of key positions, even more so than the Republicans in the previous session of Congress. One of the changes is that the majority party's control over the Foreign Relations Committee has increased. The Democratic committee has increased to eight members, while the Republicans occupy five seats. In the previous Congress, the seats on the Foreign Relations Committee were in a ratio of seven to six. Vice-President Barkley, who is about to take office, said in response to criticisms of this decision that he did not find any reason why this change would affect the foreign policy of the two parties. In terms of committee seat allocation, the Democrats announced another change today, namely that the proportion of committee members from both parties in the Appropriations Committee will be thirteen to eight, rather than the twelve to nine ratio maintained by the Republicans in the previous Congress. Senator McKellar, a Democrat from Tennessee, will serve as chairman of the committee. The Senate Democrats also appointed members to the other thirteen standing committees of the Senate. On the House side, members of some committees have also been announced by the majority party, but the complete determination of all committee members in both houses will still take some time.

[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] Minutes after Truman called on a joint session of Congress for continued bipartisan cooperation on foreign affairs, Republican foreign policy spokesman Vandenberg announced in the Senate that the Democrats had taken "separate action." Mr. Fan said that the Democratic resolution that Democrats occupy eight seats and Republicans occupy five seats on the Foreign Relations Committee surprised him. When the Republicans were the majority party in 1946 and 1947, the Republicans occupied seven seats and the Democrats occupied six seats on the committee. Although Mr. Fan criticized this action in strong terms, he did not directly target the foreign policy of the two parties.

### Strange Tragedy in Cold Night: Huge Fire in Zhabei; Five to Six Hundred Shanties Destroyed; More Than Two Thousand People Displaced; Three Firefighters and Police Injured in Brave Rescue Efforts

[Our Own Dispatch] A major fire broke out last night in the shantytowns along Zhongxing Road and Zhiwei Road in Zhabei, destroying five to six hundred houses and displacing more than two thousand people. The fire started at 8:20 PM, just as the northwest wind was blowing strongly, so it spread very quickly and turned into a sea of ​​flames in less than half an hour. When the Fire Department received the alarm, it dispatched fire engines from Hongkou, Xinzha, Central, and Yangshupu districts, as well as fire brigades from various sections of Zhabei's businesses and offices, to rush to the rescue, but due to the lack of water sources in the area, it was impossible to control the fire. Residents near the scene, seeing this, supported the elderly and carried the young, and fled for their lives. Most of the displaced residents who fled in a hurry were not fully clothed, and in the freezing weather, they wandered the streets, shivering and calling out with cold, their situation was particularly pitiful. The fire spread east to Gongxing Road, north to Zhonghua Xin Road, west to Zhiyuan Road, and south to the vicinity of Zhongxing Road, and the surrounding areas were engulfed in the fire. The most material losses were suffered by the Mingfeng Transportation Company warehouse near Zhongxing Road, which contained more than a thousand packages of tobacco leaves recently transported from Jiangxi, Bengbu and other places. As for the deaths and injuries of residents, it was impossible to investigate that night, but according to the victims who escaped from the scene, many children may have been buried there. The fire began to subside slightly around 11 PM. This reporter ventured around the scene of the fire and saw only scorched earth. The raging flames were still burning in the furniture and debris. The sound of wailing could be heard everywhere, which was unbearable to hear. The Mingfeng Transportation Company warehouse, which suffered the most damage, was the only brick building, but due to the tobacco leaves stored inside being burned, white smoke continued to rise, even until this morning. The cause of the fire was said to be an explosion of gunpowder from firecrackers. The arsonist has not yet been caught. During this fire, all important heads of the Fire Department were present to direct the firefighting, and Fire Police No. 406 Ma Guangrong, No. 282 Wang Yufa, and Volunteer Fire Police No. 417 were injured in the line of duty. The North Railway Station Police Precinct also dispatched a large number of police officers and auxiliary police to maintain order.

### General Fan Songfu Expresses Views on Peace Appeal: Let the People Decide Their Own Destiny

[Our Own Dispatch] This newspaper's reporter visited General Fan Songfu, a veteran revolutionary who has been living in Shanghai in retirement, to ask for his opinion on the call for peace. Fan has spent half his life in the military, working for the revolution. In recent years, he has not been involved in politics, but he is extremely concerned about the people's livelihood. He deeply agreed with this newspaper's editorial on the 5th, "Let the People Speak," and expressed his views as follows:

Fan said: During the Political Consultative Conference in the winter of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), I, as an objective observer, published an article in the Military Celebration Central Daily News entitled "Prospects for Peace." Fighting and ruthlessness have long forced the goddess of peace to not dare to breathe, waiting for the coming of death, injury, and destruction. However, the general public, for their own lives, always hope for peace to guarantee them at any time. On New Year's Day of the 38th year (1949), a glimmer of hope for peace finally emerged! Now, the government is initiating peace for the sake of the people's survival, which has won the sympathy of the public. However, the other side is easily suspected of using the peace offensive to reorganize its forces during the ceasefire, or believes that its own struggle has been victorious and takes this opportunity to succeed completely, and therefore ignores this call for peace. If both sides are not sincere and deceive each other, then compromise will be difficult to achieve, and two sharp knives will still be hanging over the heads of the people. In order to continue their survival, our people must rise up and act as judges for both sides. Our people are docile on the outside, but clear on the inside. We know that the "Nationalist" side has ideas and propaganda, but no practical expression; the "Communist" side has propaganda and action, but lacks insight and talent. Even if military progress is fast, political progress cannot keep up, and in the end, everything is bad! Our patience is for the hope that either side has a real way to achieve peace. If they really want to force us to the line of death, we have no choice but to rise up and "save ourselves and save the country." In the past, the middle road line was committed to peace, and the people always sympathized. Now that it has reached the time for the weekly return line, it should immediately come out to mediate. The mediation must not be opportunistic and take advantage of the fire to rob, but must hold a compassionate view and abide by the true will of the people. Whether in spirit or in fact, it will eventually be successful. Those gentlemen who are a little to the right and a little to the left should not feel ashamed because they are slightly biased, and should unite in time to form a middle ground and add, subtract, multiply, and divide these two extremes to create a new situation and clean up this broken mess. The people will always be grateful to them for the safety of their lives. As for the conditions for peace, the Nationalist and Communist parties each have their own positions. Everyone has their own reasons, and they may not be very accurate. They can both bring them up, but we should let our people choose for themselves and let our people decide their own destiny!

### Jing Panshi Talks About War and Peace

Dr. Jing Panshi, Chairman of the Far East Council of the World Christian Leaders Association in Washington, recently spoke to reporters about the issue of war and peace. He pointed out that peace is the unanimous desire of the people throughout the country at this time, and this is also true in the Communist areas. This is not caused by the apparent military weakness of the government army or the military success of the Communist Party. In fact, it is because the Chinese people cannot bear the spread of war any longer, and the social and national economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. The poverty of the people and the exhaustion of wealth have reached their extreme. If the war continues for a long time, both the government and the Communist Party will leave a disgraceful name for future historians. At this moment, it is most appropriate for neutral people with no party affiliation to come forward to mediate peace. Jing emphasized that the most desirable thing for the people of the country is to first stop military action on both sides, immediately meet each other frankly, and hold peace talks with the interests of the country and the people as the premise.

### Chinese and Foreign Power Companies Request Timely Adjustment of Electricity Prices: Continuous Rise in Fuel Prices Will Make It Impossible to Maintain Operations

According to a written statement recently issued by the responsible persons of various Chinese and foreign power companies in this city, including American-owned Shanghai Electric Power Company, Huxi Electric Power Company, French-owned Electricity Company, Shangban Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, and Chinese-owned Pudong Electric Company, etc., "Recent soaring prices, the direct increase in foreign exchange transfer certificates, and the continuous shrinking of the Taiwan dollar exchange rate have had the greatest impact on the constant high increase of fuel, namely fuel oil and coal prices, which are the most consumed by power plants. On August 1st, the price of coal was converted into gold yuan according to the legal currency, only equivalent to 26 yuan, 7 jiao, 3 fen and 5 li per ton. According to the current calculation of the price of foreign coal and Taiwan coal each accounting for half, it has increased by more than 105 times. According to the exchange certificate of US dollars before the currency reform, the price of oil has increased by 52 times. The cost of living index at the time of adjusting the electricity price in August was calculated based on 1.86 million times on July 31st, while the current gold yuan index is based on 3.63 million times on August 15th, and the difference between them is almost one time. Looking to the future, continued increases are expected in the coming days, with changes occurring several times a month. The electricity price in December was only adjusted once in early December with reference to the situation at that time. In fact, each company will not be able to collect the electricity bills after this adjustment until after January 6th of the 38th year, and the disconnection is too great, resulting in insufficient income and expenditure, and the losses are increasing day by day, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain operations, which is on the verge of collapse. The representatives of each company have successively requested the Public Utilities Bureau to follow the 15th provision of the explanation of the electricity price adjustment formula modified and stipulated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and filed with the Executive Yuan, "When the electricity sales cost of the power plant increases or decreases by 20 percent, the electricity price shall be calculated according to the formula and reported to the competent authority for approval, but the power plant may collect fees in advance, and refund or compensate for any excess or deficiency after approval." It is clear that the government has already foreseen this, and this timely adjustment method is the only countermeasure to maintain the power industry. Each company can only maintain its business and continue to supply by following this regulation and adjusting in a timely manner. If the current electricity price approval method is followed, it must be reviewed, approved, and announced before it can be implemented. By the time the electricity bills are received, not only will there be losses in terms of currency value, but if they want to resume production, there will be nothing to follow. This situation is too urgent, and they will be forced to stop operations.

### Supporting the President and Advocating for Peace: All Circles Held a Propaganda Meeting Yesterday; Peace Depends on the Sincerity of the Other Party, Deeply Saddened by the Communist Party's Stubbornness

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday morning at ten o'clock, all circles in the city held a propaganda meeting at the Tianchan Theater to support the President and advocate for peace. Representatives from various organs and groups in the city, including Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Zhu Xiaolai, Wang Zhuyi, Li Fusun, Shui Xiangyun, Zhou Xuexiang, and Xu Jiyu, totaling over a thousand people, attended the meeting. The meeting publicly elected Pan Gongzhan as the general chairman. After the meeting began, Pan first delivered a speech, saying: After the President's New Year's Day message was published this time, we were overjoyed after reading it. Recalling the past three years since the victory, our country could have devoted itself to construction, but because the Communist Party has always insisted on its claim to seize power by force and showed no sincerity towards the "Political Consultative Conference," the government had no choice but to use force. In the past three years, due to the Communist Party's momentary misjudgment, millions of people have been displaced and construction projects have been completely destroyed.

Emulating the Spirit of Buddha, Striving for Freedom and Peace

This time, the President has clearly demonstrated in his message that, for the sake of the nation and its people, and under the principles of not harming national independence and integrity, and ensuring the people's freedom and livelihood, his personal advancement or retreat will solely follow the public opinion of the people. On behalf of the Communist Party, we believe that since the door to peace has been opened, they are also descendants of the Yellow Emperor and should consider the people's lives and livelihoods, as well as the country's independence and integrity. They should immediately cease fire and engage in open and honest negotiations. However, according to recent statements from the Northern Communist Party, they are still preparing to insist on fighting to the end. Furthermore, their recent broadcast falsely accused the President's message of being a conspiracy by reactionaries. Such stubbornness has caused the infinite expectations of the entire people to return to disillusionment. At today's meeting, we are excited about the President's message on the one hand, but at the same time, we are saddened by the Communist Party's actions. People's organizations such as the Municipal Council have already sent telegrams to the Communist Party, earnestly appealing and pleading for the people. Unfortunately, the Communist Party has not yet responded. Therefore, at present, we can only concentrate the strength and will of the entire people. On the one hand, we must intensify our efforts to promote peace; on the other hand, we must not neglect preparations for war. If the Communist Party ignores the people's final advice, then it will be the public enemy of our entire people, and we will have no choice but to deal with it to the end. Before true peace arrives, we should still encourage the soldiers at the front and call on the national army and civilians so that we can eventually achieve free and independent peace. At the end of his speech, Pan used Sakyamuni Buddha as an analogy, saying that yesterday happened to be the day Sakyamuni Buddha attained enlightenment on the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, encouraging everyone to strive for peace with the spirit of Sakyamuni's universal salvation of all beings.

Must Have Sufficient Strength Before Considering Peace Talks

Mayor Wu then delivered a speech, saying: After eight years of the War of Resistance and three years of suppressing the rebellion, the Chinese people have experienced suffering, and everyone hopes for peace. However, peace cannot be achieved unilaterally; the other party must also have the sincerity to lay down their weapons before we can talk about peace. If we have the determination to seek peace, we should first show that we still have sufficient strength to fight. At the end of his speech, Wu encouraged the citizens of the city to pay attention to two points: (1) strengthen the city's self-defense capabilities, and (2) continue to comfort the soldiers on the front lines. Next, Fang Zhi gave a speech, roughly saying: Since safeguarding China's peace is the business of the common people themselves, the common people should take active action to express their views. Recently, the councils and organizations of various provinces and cities have sent telegrams advocating for peace. Now, we should go a step further and send representatives of the people who are well-respected and peace-loving from the industrial, commercial, and social circles to the Communist areas by special plane to inquire whether the Communist Party has any sincerity for peace. If the Communist Party agrees to peace, then everyone will talk about peace. If they don't want peace and want to fight, then let's fight. If the Communist Party is willing to be an enemy of our common people, then we can only make a final stand.

The People Should Supervise the Achievement of the Peace Mission

Fang also said: Some people advocate for inviting the British, French, and Soviet governments to mediate in writing. Standing in the position of the common people, I am against this proposal. China's affairs should be managed by the Chinese people themselves. The time has not yet come to ask foreign friends to intervene. Foreign friends may still be unclear about the situation of the Communist Party and may not be able to understand it clearly. Therefore, the mission of peace should be supervised and achieved by the people themselves. In short, we hope that the Communist Party will wake up, be open and honest with each other, and return to good relations. That would be a blessing for the Chinese people. If they are stubborn and insist on rebellion to the end, then our common people, in order to protect their own lives and property, and in order to save China from danger, will have no choice but to unite, arm ourselves, eliminate the Communist bandits, and strive for peace.

Afterwards, Wang Xiaolai, Zhou Xuexiang, and others delivered speeches one after another. The meeting did not end until nearly twelve o'clock, with enthusiastic applause.

Appeal to Compatriots from the General Assembly

The telegram to compatriots across the country passed at yesterday's meeting is as follows: To all provincial and municipal councils, organizations, newspaper offices, and to all compatriots across the country. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, when the Japanese bandits surrendered, it was a time when the world was clear and the people hoped for peace and stability. We looked forward to pooling our collective wisdom and efforts to jointly plan for peace and stability. Who would have thought that the political consultation would fail, and the flames of the War of Resistance had just subsided, but the war to suppress the rebellion had begun again? Alas, my people, disasters have not ceased. After three years, the flames of war are raging like tea, the situation at the border is turbulent, and the mountains and rivers are stained with blood and tears. The victory feels like a dream, and who knows when the war will end? Thinking of this, grief and indignation fill our hearts. Our President Chiang Kai-shek deeply cares for the people and does not want to prolong the suffering of the people. He specially issued a New Year's Day message to promote peace. The words are sincere, and the demeanor is generous, which is appreciated by all the people and admired by people at home and abroad. The principles of peace he proposed are also the basic conditions for establishing the country, which our entire people unanimously demand. His open and honest expression regarding his personal advancement or retreat is especially enough to make those who take advantage of the current situation to indulge their selfish desires feel ashamed. The Communist Party is also a descendant of the Yellow Emperor. Why are they enslaved by foreigners and harm their brothers? Driving the people into the flames of war is extremely cruel! Rather than fighting to mutual destruction, why not reconcile and allow both sides to survive? The government has already opened the door to peace, and the Communist Party should stop the path of killing. It is not too late to rein in at the precipice. This meeting feels the President's sincerity and does not want this glimmer of peace to be fleeting. Therefore, we are specially sending a telegram to compatriots across the country to be alert to the situation, seize the opportunity, and strive to resonate with peace. We call on the Communist Party to immediately cease fire on the ground, and send plenipotentiary representatives to reopen peace talks, negotiate sincerely, eliminate suspicion and resentment, and seek a reasonable solution. Even if there are disputes, they should be decided by public opinion, abandoning weapons on the battlefield, and holding jade and silk at the altar. Then the overwhelming atmosphere of killing will be transformed into auspiciousness. We hope that our compatriots will rise up and cry out for peace together. Shanghai All Circles Support the President and Advocate for Peace General Assembly, (seal).

### Winter Relief Fundraising Successfully Completed; Expected to Exceed Original Target, All Industries Hope to Submit Payments Early

### Abundant Arrivals, Tight Credit; Rice Prices Dropped Yesterday; Flour, Grain, Oil Cakes: Weakening Confidence, Consistent Decline

The rice market has turned downstream. As the end of the year approaches, rural goods are arriving in abundance. Yesterday, arrivals increased sharply. In addition, credit is tight and other commodity prices have weakened. Sellers are eager to sell and there are many samples, causing prices to fall. The price of white粳 in the North Market fell to 760 yuan, a decrease of 50 yuan compared to before. Single-season稻 also fell by 50 yuan each. 羊秈 and 社秈 fell by 60 yuan. Only the indigenous rice, due to its scarcity and active sales, remained at its original price. In the South Rice Market, white粳 and early rice each fell by 20 yuan, and light rice fell by 10 yuan. The premium white rice remained firm. Arrivals in the two markets totaled 16,699 shi.

Flour has fallen from its peak. Due to tight credit and the decline in non-industry commodity prices, sellers are dumping a lot. However, due to the absorption by the North gang, the price of "military ship flour" is higher than that of "old car flour." Old car flour is 335 yuan, a decrease of 50 yuan from the previous day. The closing price of military ship flour is 343 yuan, a decrease of 38 yuan from the previous day. Red Bee and Jiancheng each fell by 46-47 yuan. Miscellaneous brands of flour also fell. Bran also followed suit, with large bags of bran falling by 35 yuan.

Grains: Under tight credit, prices have fallen across the board. Due to the financial difficulties of the foreign gangs, purchases are slow and stagnant. The closing price of yellow soybeans dropped sharply, with the closing price of乍豆 at 450 yuan, a decrease of 90 yuan. The absorption of corn by the North gang was small, and the price dropped by more than 10%. Huangdu corn was very active and was the only one that remained stable. Red sorghum fell by 50 yuan. Mung beans and元麦 all fell sharply. Sesame fell sharply by 100 yuan. 生仁 was not bought by the Cantonese gang and dropped by 300 yuan.

Cooking oil has fallen by 10%. Due to tight credit and the decline in non-industry commodity prices, confidence has weakened. Moreover, oil factories have opened a lot. Soybean oil factories opened at 2,700 yuan, and the lowest price was 2,500 yuan. The closing price rebounded to 2,650 yuan, but it was still 300 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. The closing price of raw 棻 oil was 2,450 yuan, a decrease of 350 yuan. The opening price of 吉桶 raw oil was 2,700 yuan, a decrease of 300 yuan.

### Credit Tightness Intensifies; Interbank Lending Rates Rise Steadily

Yesterday, credit in the city was still very tight. Interbank borrowing was widespread, and external supply was extremely scarce. Remittances from various places rarely arrived, and banks collected a lot of payments. Market funds were in short supply, and interbank lending rates rose steadily. Furthermore, because banks were carrying high overdue interest, the daily lending rate was as high as 50-60 yuan. The liquidity crunch was even worse than before New Year's Eve. At the same time, the supply of cash was also tight, and discounts were still being offered.

Yesterday, the Central Bank collected a lot of proceeds from the sale of confiscated goods. According to the person in charge of the business bureau, the amount was close to 100 million yuan. Among them, cotton yarn settlements were the largest, followed by food grains and silk.

### General Inspection of Banks and Shops Completed

The general inspection of banks and shops in the city, which was conducted by the Gold Control Bureau a few days ago, has now come to an end. The general operations of banks and shops are still normal, and the amount of deposits has increased. However, it was found that two or three banks and shops were suspected of creating false accounts, and the bureau is currently sending personnel to investigate.

In addition, in order to supervise the deposit and exchange of gold by banks and shops, the bureau has dispatched a large number of staff members to the seven exchange locations to conduct on-site supervision. The matters being supervised are as follows: (1) Whether the application forms issued by each bank and shop comply with formal procedures and whether there is any fraud. (2) Whether the payments are remitted in cash in accordance with the regulations. (3) Whether the other banks and shops deposit the cash in the Central Bank on the same day. According to reports, the results of the inspections over the past few days have been very good.

### More Than Twenty Banks Have Used Increased Capital in Cash

[Our Newspaper's Report] Although the competent authorities are aware of the tight credit situation, they have allowed banks and shops to use the cash portion of their increased capital. Yesterday, about twenty banks and shops applied to the Gold Control Bureau to use it, and all were approved by the bureau. According to regulations, the use of the cash portion of increased capital has long been approved by the Ministry of Finance, but it must be used for production and construction purposes. According to the Central Bank, the period of use is usually ten days, up to one month, and must be approved by the Gold Control Bureau after reviewing its purpose.

### Fifth Meeting of the Production Loan to Continue Reviewing Industrial Loan Cases

The Special Loans Committee is expediting the handling of purchase cases in the emergency industrial loan program. To date, the committee has approved more than 200 purchase cases, with a total amount of more than 30 million yuan. Cases that are not suitable for purchase or those who are unwilling to purchase have applied for transfer to mortgage and rediscount, and there are currently many cases. The committee is scheduled to convene its fifth secret review meeting on production and export businesses at 3:00 PM today to discuss this matter.

According to Lin Chongyong, Secretary-General of the Special Loans Committee, the Central Bank's emergency industrial loan program focuses especially on small factories. These small factories are in a particularly difficult situation, and the committee is currently drafting measures based on the actual situation so that all small factories in the city can benefit from the government's benefits.

### Sugar Prices Mostly Increased, Few Decreased

Yesterday, banks tightened credit, interbank interest rates rose secretly, and internal sales of goods for interest continued in the market. However, because of the small increase in prices before, people were still optimistic about the market. Each shop first quoted low prices, and the market trend fluctuated in the middle. Until the close, buying sentiment rose again, and the market situation was low first and high later.

### Tea Market Trend Firm

Yesterday was the second day of trading for the tea market in the new spring. Although credit was tight and prices of external commodities were falling, people's confidence remained firm and brokers continued to quote higher prices, causing the trend to continue to rise. The market was more bullish than before. Overall, this situation shows no signs of imminent danger, and transactions are still limited and protracted due to haggling.

### Cotton Yarn Market Downstream; Cloth Sales Slow, Prices See Small Decline

The cotton yarn market is weak. Due to tight credit, the price of each yarn has fallen again after rising. However, the price of fine yarn remains firm, while the price of coarse yarn has loosened.

42-count Lanfeng opened at a high price of 52,500 yuan, but fell to 48,000 yuan in the middle. The noon closing price recovered to the original price of 50,000 yuan of the previous day, leveling with the previous day. There was little change in other yarns such as Shiguang and Tiannu. 40-count Lanfeng fell by 1,500 yuan, ending at 47,500 yuan. 32-count Lanfeng fell slightly by 300 yuan.

21-count Shuangma spot goods rose from 33,000 yuan to a maximum of 36,500 yuan, and finally closed at 34,200 yuan, falling by 1,300 yuan. Factory orders fell by 1,500 yuan, and arbitrage for one day was 2,000 yuan. 20-count Shuangma fell to the 30,000 yuan mark and stopped, finally falling by 2,000 yuan. Other yarns fell by 500 yuan to 2,000 yuan each.

The cloth market saw a slight decline. Credit in the market was generally tight, sales to customers were slow, and many dealers were selling goods due to demand. Longtou fine cloth opened at 1,320 yuan, and then rose to the noon closing price of 1,410 yuan of the previous day due to purchases by the Cantonese gang. The market trend was stagnant near noon, and finally closed at 1,350 yuan, falling by 60 yuan. The prices of middle-grade fine cloth each fell by 50 yuan to 100 yuan. Sijunzi yuan bījī opened in the morning at 1,200 yuan, and once rose slightly to 1,255 yuan. The noon closing price was 1,240 yuan, falling by 60 yuan. Sijunzi yuan zhígòng fell by 80 yuan, closing at 1,290 yuan. The prices of 190 high-grade 士林 and other colored cloths mostly remained unchanged.

### China Textile Sold More Than 10,000 Bolts of Cloth; Central Bank Also Sold Yarn as Usual

### Silk, First Low Then High

Yesterday, the silk market saw prices rise and then fall. Prices of various outside commodities initially rose and then retreated. Foreign exchange transfer certificates also showed a slight pullback. Market sentiment was weak, further exacerbated by tight credit conditions, with the unofficial market interest rate rising to 50 yuan. Many holders took the opportunity to sell at higher prices. Spot transactions were scattered, leading to a languid market atmosphere.

"120" brand raw silk from Tianwu opened at 480,000 yuan in the morning. After the opening, news of strong foreign exchange boosted market sentiment slightly, and asking prices rose by a thousand yuan. However, large traders took the opportunity to unload at higher prices, and smaller players followed suit. Buyers immediately turned cautious, and the market retreated again, finally closing slightly lower at 480,000 yuan, down 2,000 yuan. Dongyang, Jin San, Masnia, and others all showed weakness.

Raw silk prices yesterday were soft due to the retreat of artificial silk, leading to sluggish silk fabric prices. Foreign trade companies had not yet opened their orders for export goods, and the market was also weak. Domestic silk weaving companies were inactive in placing orders, and industry credit remained tight. Trading on the market was quiet, and prices fell immediately after the opening. Grade D, 7-8 degree even white filature silk was initially priced at 550,000 yuan, with few transactions. Selling pressure increased, and asking prices continued to decline, reaching a low of 530,000 yuan. Near noon, those who were short of orders had arranged to cover their positions, and the eagerness to sell eased slightly. Buyers took advantage of the low prices to absorb supply, and the market recovered after the initial decline, finally closing at 540,000 yuan, down 5,500 yuan from the previous noon closing. Other grades followed suit with smaller declines.

Silk fabrics were weak yesterday due to the soft prices of raw silk and artificial silk. Prices of various outside commodities retreated in tandem. Market sentiment was nervous, with more selling than buying. Trading opened at lower prices, and prices rebounded slightly at the close. Meiya quilt covers opened lower at 271,000 yuan, then traders stepped in to push prices up. Short sellers rushed to cover, and order books seemed strong. Asking prices rose gradually, hovering around 290,000 yuan. Then smaller players took profits, and the market weakened again, with prices fluctuating up and down. Finally, industry credit conditions eased slightly after being tight, and market sentiment became volatile again. Prices initially stabilized and then rose, closing near noon at 293,000 yuan. Huaqiang closed at 292,000 yuan, both down over 2,000 yuan from the previous noon closing. Dacheng crepe remained unchanged, while Dawei wool was down 100 yuan, Xiaowu yuan was down 5 yuan, and Siwei wool rose slightly by 3-5 yuan.

### Tung Oil Bounces Slightly From Low

Yesterday's tung oil market returned to a meandering pattern. Although sellers continued to support prices from morning till close, the sudden tightening of credit and the lack of buying interest made it impossible to continue the rally. As a result, the market was similar to the previous day, and the low level was not firmly established.

### Year-End Approaching, North-South Goods Sales Strong

With the end of the lunar year approaching, trade in North-South goods and seafood has been exceptionally strong in recent days. Although seafood arrivals are plentiful, sales are also high. Other North-South goods are in short supply due to transportation disruptions. Dried noodles, longan, and other items have risen by two to three times.

It is also reported that vegetable arrivals have decreased due to cold weather, rising prices at the source, and transportation difficulties. Sales have also increased significantly due to the year-end season. According to industry insiders, this is a common pattern every year and there are no special factors.

### Winter in Bengbu

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Ling Songshou

[Report from Bengbu, 2nd of this month] During my fifty days in Bengbu, I witnessed the beginning or end of the Xuzhou Campaign and the Bengbu-Suxian Campaign. Today, with a brief respite from the drums of war, I reflect on the evolution of events and am filled with emotion. It is undeniable that in these two major campaigns in northern Anhui, the National Army had gains, but also setbacks. Today, the authorities have decided on a strategy of firmly defending the Huai River as a barrier to the capital. The situation is certainly serious, but there are lessons to be learned from the failures. The countless problems hidden in the front and the rear, or between the upper and lower levels, are worthy of our deep thought and review.

According to what I have seen, from the fall of Suxian to the National Army's retreat to the Huai River, Bengbu itself has always been so quiet and calm. Although there was some turmoil in the middle, it was entirely due to poor human planning. For example, at the end of November, the National Army's Li and Huang army corps, affected by the loss of Lingbi, originally planned to join forces in Suxian, but instead retreated all the way to the south bank of the North Fei River. Cao Lao Ji was lost, and at night, standing on a three-story building, one could see the fires of the battlefield thirty miles away. The people of Bengbu were originally indifferent, but they could not withstand the fact that the entire staff of the municipal government, the municipal council, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Central Bank had all fled. Mayor Li Renqiao remained alone in the municipal government, as he could not leave. The Chamber of Commerce had no one in charge for six days, and re-elections were held. Later, when the situation stabilized, the people who had fled all returned. A slogan appeared on the streets of Bengbu: "Bengbu is as solid as a rock, welcome Chen Xiewu and Guo Huawu back in triumph!" (Chen Xiewu is the former chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and Guo Huawu is the manager of the Bengbu branch of the Central Bank.) This is the humor of the people of Huaishang. Furthermore, a week ago, it was rumored in Bengbu that Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi had already left Bengbu and returned south, and everyone was preparing to move. The news was spread by the deputy mayor of the municipal government, and a section chief of a certain pacification area also mentioned it to me. It was not until Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi led Hu Fo, the deputy commander of the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Border Area Suppression, in spending two consecutive days inspecting various agencies in the city that the rumors subsided.

The Most Loyal Sons of the Huai River

The day after the Jinghu Comfort Mission arrived in Bengbu, Shao En, the secretary-general of the Bengbu City Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, proposed at a public banquet for the mission that the cost of Bengbu's city defense works was too great for the people to bear, and that the defense of Bengbu was not only for the sake of Bengbu, but was related to the overall situation, so its expenses should be borne by the people of the whole country, and should not be borne solely by the people of Bengbu. Representative Zhao Hui Tan immediately stated that he would often raise it in the Yuan Hui after returning to Beijing. Later, Shao Hua, representing the National Comforting Association, also spoke a few words in the capacity of a native of Huaibei. He said: The brave men of Huaishang have a glorious history in the past, and the achievements of the Han and Ming dynasties represented by Liu Bang and Zhu Yuanzhang are excellent proof. However, today the brave men of Huaishang have become an "old ox pulling a broken cart," which can be used, but if not used well, it will be dragged down. He hopes that those who are leading the brave men of Huaishang today will use them well. The brave men of Huaishang are the most loyal, and anyone can whip them and spur them on. Whoever can use them well is their loyal worker. Mr. Shao's remarks won a round of applause.

Not counting the eight years of the War of Resistance, the Suppression of Rebellion has been fought for three years, and today the issue of who bears the burden of the war has become a problem for discussion, which is our sorrow. General Yu Zhaolong, the commander of the Bengbu Garrison, once expressed the view that today's war is a war of the whole nation, and the responsibility for paying for it should not be limited to the war zone, nor should it be limited to a certain class. He is powerless to break down this kind of prejudice, and he can only urge the people of Bengbu to save as much as possible.

Soldiers Break Through With Weapons

In the three years I have spent running around the battlefields between the rivers, I have been most deeply moved by this time in Bengbu. Three days after the Huang Wei Army Corps broke through, a battalion of more than thirty remaining soldiers, carrying their full complement of weapons, made their way to Bengbu to report for duty. They were resting by the side of the street, waiting to be received. A squad leader said, "If I don't die this time, I'll definitely have a few more good years to live." His clothes were wet, his feet were worn out, but he had no complaints. I also saw with my own eyes an old man bringing a pair of shoes and socks to a soldier whose feet were too sore to walk. The warm sympathy filled the scene I saw with humanity. Therefore, based on my intuition, today's morale is very usable, and today's people's hearts are not all dead. It only depends on whether the government can grasp it well and make good use of it in the future.
