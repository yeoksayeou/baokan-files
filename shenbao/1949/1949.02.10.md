### 首都政治穿氣沉寂　李代總統昨夜返京　顏惠慶等展期明日飛平

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The capital experienced a day of continuous rain on the 9th, with inclement weather.  Acting President Li, originally scheduled to return to Beijing from Shanghai on the 9th, as well as the two Yuan Presidents Yu and Tong returning from Guangzhou, and Presidential Secretary-General Weng Wenhao and legislator Cheng Siyuan returning from Taiwan, were all prevented from returning as scheduled due to the adverse weather conditions. The political atmosphere in Beijing on the 9th was as沉寂 and depressing as the weather.  Everyone earnestly hoped that the Shanghai peace delegation would fly to Beiping as soon as possible to facilitate the start of peace talks.

[Our Dispatch] Acting President Li boarded a night train to return to Beijing at 11:00 PM on the 9th, accompanied by Huang Xuecun and others. Huang Shaohong remained in Shanghai. The Acting President did not leave the Huang residence yesterday, but received a large number of visiting guests. He was originally scheduled to return to Beijing on the "Meiling" special plane in the morning, but was unsuccessful due to the adverse weather conditions in Beijing.

[Central News Agency, This City] Huang Xuecun, Director of the Second Bureau of the Presidential Office, told reporters yesterday that Acting President Li attended the graduation ceremony of the cadre training class on the afternoon of the 8th and gave a speech, the main points of which included two aspects: First, he emphasized the importance of rectifying military discipline. The Acting President felt deeply saddened by the laxity of military discipline. If efforts are not made to rectify it, the military cannot fulfill its duty to protect the country and its people. Second, the Acting President explained the government's sincerity in seeking peace, urging the trainees of the cadre training class to share the difficulties and fulfill their responsibilities. The reports in certain newspapers regarding the content of the Acting President's speech contain many inaccuracies, such as the statement that Acting President Li told military officers: "We have been constantly seeking peace, but the Communist Party continues to attack us militarily. We must respond to any attacks," and that Acting President Li "convened a meeting of lower-level cadres," are all untrue.

[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai peace delegation, originally scheduled to depart yesterday morning, decided to change its original plan and postpone its departure to 10:00 AM tomorrow upon receiving a notice from Beiping at the last moment. The reason given by the CCP for requesting the delegation's postponement to Beiping was not explained. According to Gan Jiehou: He had contacted Beiping the night before, agreeing to speak to Beiping again between 9:00 AM and 9:50 AM yesterday (the 9th). If everything was in order, the delegation would then take off. However, the Beiping telephone call did not arrive until after 10:00 AM. The CCP side requested the delegation to postpone its departure from Shanghai to Beiping until 10:00 AM on the morning of the 11th. If the weather is good at that time, they can take off directly without contacting Beiping again. According to the wireless communication from Longhua Airport, the weather in Qingdao and Beiping was good for flying yesterday morning. Therefore, there must be other reasons why Beiping requested the delegation to postpone its trip north. Yesterday morning, all the peace delegates gathered at Yan Huiqing's residence around 9:00 AM as agreed the night before, waiting quietly for Gan Jiehou's notification before departing. Many well-known figures in the city also went to Yan's residence to see them off. When they did not receive Gan's notification by 10:00 AM, they all showed anxious expressions. Gan arrived at 10:20 AM, explained everything, and after consultation, it was decided to postpone the discussion until tomorrow. However, the delegates' optimistic mood was clearly affected.

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 9th] Weng Wenhao and Cheng Siyuan flew to Shanghai together at 11:30 AM on the 9th. Secretary-General Pu Xuefeng saw them off at the airport.

[Central News Agency, This City] Cheng Siyuan was invited by Chairman Chen of the Taiwan Provincial Government to meet with him some days ago to discuss matters. Having completed his public duties, he returned to Shanghai by plane at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 9th. Weng Wenhao came with him.

### Deng Wenyi Holds Press Conference, Issues Written Statement Elaborating on the Development of Peace and War, Saying the National Army is Confident of Preventing the Communist Army from Crossing the River

[Our Dispatch] Deng Wenyi, Director of the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, held a press conference at the Military Friends Society at 3:00 PM yesterday, issuing a written statement on "The Development of Peace and War," elaborating on the principles of "the government wants peace, the CCP wants war, the partial peace in Beiping is a deception, and preparing for war to seek peace, and being able to fight is the only way to achieve peace." He also answered various questions from reporters. According to Deng's judgment, it will take at least two months or more for the Communist Party to launch an offensive across the Yangtze River. Based on past experience, the Communist army needs a month to reorganize and replenish after each battle. However, the Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng troops suffered heavy losses in the Xuzhou-Huaihai Campaign, with casualties reaching two-thirds. Observing the recent northward withdrawal of some Communist troops on the Jinpu Southern Line, it is undoubtedly for adjustment and replenishment, which cannot be completed within a month. Moreover, the rainy season is approaching, which is unfavorable for combat, and there is a shortage of supplies, making military logistics difficult. Therefore, he believes that the Communist army's attack on the Yangtze River will be at least two months away. Deng also claimed that the National Army is confident of preventing the Communist army from crossing the river. He said that it is difficult to completely avoid a few Communist troops from crossing the river by stealth, but they can be annihilated immediately and will not have an impact. As for a large-scale crossing of the river by hundreds of thousands of people, it would require a large number of ships. Furthermore, under the concentrated fire of the National Army's naval, land, and air artillery, their attempt can be shattered. Regarding the future fate of the city, whether the government intends to abandon it or use it as a battlefield, Deng refused to discuss it, believing that the National Army can prevent the Communist army north of the Yangtze River.

Deng also said that his speech on "preparing for war to seek peace, and being able to fight is the only way to achieve peace" will not affect the peace efforts of Acting President Li and Yan Huiqing. Although this written statement has not been reviewed by Acting President Li, Acting President Li agrees with the principle of comprehensive peace. The government's policy has not changed and it is still seeking peace, but not the partial peace of the Beiping type, and it believes that there can be no peace without preparation for war. Deng revealed that He Yingqin may go to Beijing to assume a certain important position, and the National Army is preparing to carry out a "cleansing campaign" in Jiangnan to eliminate local communists. In response to reporters' inquiries, he said that the National Army in Nantong had automatically withdrawn a week ago. As to whether Li Mingyang's activities in northern Jiangsu represent the government, he said he had no knowledge of it. He also said that according to information from half a year ago, there were 140,000 Koreans, 20,000 Japanese, and 40,000 people of a certain country in the Northeast Communist Army. (The full text of Deng's written statement is published on page two.)

### 三月廿九日　在穗開全會說　京中未獲證實

### Report of a Plenary Session to be Held in Guangzhou on March 29th Not Confirmed in Beijing

[United Press, Nanjing, 9th] A United Press reporter inquired with the authorities in Beijing on the 9th regarding the report in the Shibao Times that the Kuomintang will hold a plenary session in Guangzhou on March 29th, and that Chiang Kai-shek will go to Guangzhou in his capacity as the party's Director-General to preside over the session. However, it was not confirmed. Since there are no officials with authority on this matter in Beijing, Dr. Qiu Changwei, a private advisor to Acting President Li, may have been aware of the matter. He told United Press that, as of now, he has not heard of any plans to convene a plenary session. He believes that the truthfulness of this report is doubtful, but he did not directly say that it was impossible.

Although this report has not been confirmed, it has aroused the interest of many people in Beijing. If the plenary session is indeed held, then there will be two possibilities: (1) Chiang Kai-shek will actively participate in politics again in his capacity as Director-General, or (2) Chiang may resign as Director-General again, requesting the plenary session to elect a new person. In this case, he will be completely disconnected from political affairs.

Qualified observers say that the possibility of Chiang resigning as Director-General of the Kuomintang is far greater than his actively participating in politics again. According to people close to Chiang, this is Chiang's intention. A few days before Chiang "retired" from Beijing, he told them that he had decided not to be involved in politics for at least the next five years. The so-called next five years refers to his entire six-year term as president.

These observers say that if Chiang resigns as Director-General of the Kuomintang, he may take the same approach as when he resigned as president, that is, he will temporarily retire, and the plenary session will elect an Acting Director-General. As for the candidate for Acting Director-General, it will likely be Li Zongren.

Before the war, the Southern Baptist Convention had more than 200 staff members working in China. Currently, there are only more than 160 people. Staff in Shandong and Henan have been evacuated, and the fate of the church's property in those areas is uncertain. Church work is proceeding smoothly in East and South China."

### 美西岸進出口商　準備與中共通商

### West Coast Importers and Exporters Preparing to Trade with the CCP

[United Press, San Francisco, 9th] West Coast importers and exporters are preparing to trade with the Chinese Communist regime. This was revealed in a United Press survey of the opinions of merchants in this traditional "gateway to the East." If the CCP government decides to erect a "curtain" around the Chinese economy, the United States is likely to lose all or part of its approximately $400 million in trade with China, out of a total annual trade with the East of $1 billion. However, these importers and exporters, and other merchants, do not believe that the CCP plans to cut off trade with the United States. They point out that the CCP has recently adopted a "moderate" attitude towards foreigners in the North Chinese cities it has conquered.

Editorial

### Atlantic Treaty and Soviet-Norwegian Non-Aggression

Stalin's "peace plan" having failed to break the deadlock between the United States and the Soviet Union, a "cold war" in the international arena naturally only returned with renewed force. Reviewing the Soviet Union's seven "peace plans," the most important was the demand that the United States abandon the Atlantic Security Pact; while the diplomatic authorities of Western countries were actively working to conclude this pact, without relaxing their efforts due to Stalin's new peace posture. The United States and seven other countries, including the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Canada, reached an agreement on the key points of the treaty terms on February 4th, and it is expected that the foreign ministers of each country will sign and officially announce it in early March; Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Portugal, and Italy will all sign and join the pact before its announcement.

Although the content of the Atlantic Treaty has undergone significant revisions, stipulating that an attack on any member state will be regarded as an attack on all member states, requiring immediate action against the aggressor; this action does not necessarily require military intervention, but could be diplomatic or economic sanctions against the aggressor or its military. The significance of this provision is that the previous requirement for each member state to help friendly countries with military action has been abandoned, and whether each member state participates in the war can be freely decided by the country's parliament. This major revision, by not making the obligations of the contracting states mandatory, will greatly reduce the role of the Atlantic Treaty as a military alliance. However, from the Soviet Union's point of view, no matter how the terms of the Atlantic Treaty are revised, it is ultimately a major threat to the Soviet Union, and therefore it has to launch a diplomatic offensive, trying to hold back the Nordic countries, teaching them not to join this Atlantic Treaty, to reduce the direct threat it faces.

The Soviet Union attaches particular importance to Norway's position among the Nordic countries, and therefore formally proposed to Norway on February 5th the conclusion of a Soviet-Norwegian non-aggression treaty, partly to dispel all of Norway's doubts about the Soviet Union's intentions; and partly to hope that Norway would not join the Atlantic Treaty, so as to prevent Western allies from establishing military bases on its territory. This is stated very clearly in the Soviet note, which bluntly points out that the establishment of military bases by Western allies on Norwegian territory "is of utmost importance to the Soviet Union, because Norway and the Soviet Union are geographically adjacent and have a common defense line." From the Soviet Union's perspective, it is natural to discuss the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between Norway and the Soviet Union to enhance the sense of security in Northern Europe; however, in today's world where international credibility is non-existent, the Norwegians cannot help but have doubts about the extent to which a non-aggression treaty can guarantee security. Historical facts are the best lesson: the Soviet Union concluded a non-aggression treaty with Finland in 1932, but by 1938 the Soviet Union disregarded this sacred treaty and openly ordered the Red Army to invade Finnish territory. Furthermore, Germany concluded a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union in 1939, but not long after, German troops shifted eastward and attacked Soviet territory. A few examples are enough to prove that the non-aggression treaty has long been a bankrupt diplomatic policy, and its value will be even less in the future.

Currently, Norway is still undecided whether to join the Atlantic Treaty or conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. According to political figures in Oslo, they do not oppose concluding a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union in principle, but in terms of geographical location, Norway belongs to the Atlantic, and everything will have to wait until Foreign Minister Lange returns home to decide. Judging from his tone, he is clearly leaning towards the Atlantic Treaty. Moreover, Foreign Minister Lange has already made clear his stance on joining the Atlantic Treaty. Before going to the United States, he told the Norwegian Parliament: (1) If Norway does not have external support, it will never be able to stop any strong country from attacking it, or retaliate against the attacker; (2) We need to import military equipment in order to build defense works. After arriving in the United States, he also said that the purpose of his trip was to ask the U.S. State Department what kind of security guarantees Norway could get if it joined the Atlantic Treaty. If he can obtain a firm guarantee from the U.S. State Department, there is no question that Norway will decide to join the Atlantic Treaty. Once Norway takes this path, the participation of Sweden and Denmark in the Atlantic Treaty, apart from Finland which is within the Iron Curtain, is also an inevitable trend.

### The Saying that Hunan Province Retained National Taxes Differs Slightly from the Facts

Allocated and Borrowed from the Central Bank According to Procedures

[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 9th] Hunan News Agency: The rumor that the provincial government retained national taxes differs slightly from the facts. In order to meet emergency needs, the provincial government has a proposal to allocate and borrow national taxes from the Central Bank of Changsha. Everything is done according to the original regulations. After the national tax authorities collect and directly transfer the taxes to the Central Bank, the provincial government then allocates and borrows from the Central Bank, which is completely different from direct retention.

[United Press, Beiping, 9th] The Beiping Office of the China Branch of the Economic Cooperation Administration is currently in a dilemma. The office was originally scheduled to close on the 4th and evacuate all personnel who wished to leave Beiping by air, but Director Davis has so far been unable to contact the Communists, making it impossible to obtain permission for the plane to land. He only indirectly learned that the Communists would not allow planes from anti-communist areas to come to Beiping, except for planes carrying peace delegations. Although the office hopes to use the planes carrying drugs for Xiehe Hospital to evacuate personnel, this is almost impossible unless the Communists change their position. There are currently about 100,000 tons of flour in the office that have not been distributed, and the Communists do not seem to allow it to be moved. The vehicles parked in the office square have been strictly inspected by the Communist army. It is reported that all vehicles must be registered, and the office immediately sent personnel to run around, only to learn that this registration is limited to Chinese vehicles. Moreover, because they dared not drive rashly and seek trouble for themselves, they drove all the vehicles into the U.S. Consulate to await further orders. Foreigners are also putting aside their private cars.

### The Development of Peace and War, Deng Wenyu Published the Full Text of His Written Statement

(1) The Government Wants Peace: In view of the years of war in the country and the people's livelihood, since President Chiang issued a statement on New Year's Day this year and put forward five articles representing the national public opinion, in the past forty days, he has constantly and sincerely demanded peace, such as the Executive Yuan's resolution to unconditionally cease fire, appointing representatives to conduct peace talks, President Chiang's resignation, and Vice President Li's decision to take many measures to promote peace to show his sincerity and determination, and inviting people's representatives to go to Beiping to have preliminary talks with the Communist Party, and telegraphing Mao Zedong to urge him to send representatives back as soon as possible to discuss the location and implement peace talks. However, the government's desire for peace also has three principles, namely, equal peace, comprehensive peace, and conditional peace. If these principles are violated, peace will be false and impossible to achieve. In the military aspect, the government has continuously withdrawn troops close to the Communist army's defense line. The National Army in Beiping has long ceased fire and withdrawn from Beiping. In East China, except for a few bridgeheads on the north bank of the Yangtze River, the National Army has almost completely withdrawn. This series of expressions can be seen by anyone that the government is sincerely seeking peace.

(2) The CCP Wants War: The CCP's broadcasts before New Year's Day called for "carrying out the war to the end." On January 5, Xinhua News Agency broadcasted that it strongly opposed the President's statement and ridiculed and criticized it incomparably. On January 14, Mao Zedong put forward eight conditions for resuming peace talks, and after stating them, he instructed his commanders and soldiers to "resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate" the government army. On the 21st and 25th, he repeatedly issued broadcasts, insisting on punishing the "war criminals" before peace talks could be held. On the 28th and 29th, he issued lengthy broadcasts, adding unnecessary complications, not only demanding the arrest of the so-called "domestic war criminals" first, but also demanding the punishment of Japanese war criminals as a prerequisite for peace talks. Many places were full of arrogance and shrewish scolding, such as "clear it up, calculate it, fight it, fight for it," and "have the right to order you," etc. His warmongering mood and lack of sincerity for peace, even a three-foot-tall child would not be deceived by him. On the 7th of this month, the Communist Party broadcast that it refused the government representatives to go to Ping, and satirized Shao Lizi and Gan Jihou as peace peddlers and peace wanderers. At the same time, in terms of actions, the Communist Party immediately occupied every inch of the area where the government troops withdrew, attacking everywhere, and never allowing any gap area to be used as a buffer zone in the process of peace talks between the two sides. The rumor offensive and political offensive in our rear have also intensified and become pervasive. All of these are enough to prove that the Communist Party has no sincerity for peace and is actively deploying a larger-scale, comprehensive war, attempting to invade the Yangtze River coastline, especially the Beijing-Shanghai-Wuhan area, and plunging hundreds of millions of our compatriots in Jiangnan into the atmosphere of war and chaos.

(3) The Partial Peace in Beiping Has Become a Scam: In order to reduce losses and complete his dream of dominating China, the CCP has been arranging local peace scams in various places for the past month. From the people who recently escaped from Beiping and the reports of newspapers in various places, we can easily see that after the announcement of the local peace agreement in Beiping, everything has fallen into the shroud of the Iron Curtain. For example, what the Communist Party has been shouting about every day, such as democracy and freedom, what is being shown everywhere in Beiping today is arresting people everywhere, searching everywhere, without any democracy or freedom. Even the terms agreed upon by both sides during the partial talks, the Communist Party has not implemented any of them, and even the minimum joint office has not been properly formed. Instead, Ye Jianying was appointed as the mayor by the Communist Party to preside over all municipal affairs, and a military control committee was established, and thousands of people were arrested and dealt with in the name of "national special agents" and "war criminals." Regarding the issue of guaranteeing the safety of the National Army, which was agreed upon in advance, the Communist Party is now oppressing the National Army stationed in Ping, dividing them into several locations in the four suburbs of Beiping, and stationing them in various places, with the Communist Army individually responsible for the truth, assigning political commissars, forcing senior military officers to leave, coercing officers and soldiers to reorganize, and restricting food and water sources, making the 200,000 National Army trapped in a desperate situation where they cannot live or die. Moreover, it was broadcast that he had been referred to as General Yi and placed under guard in the name of the number one war criminal in North China, so that there was no one hundred percent guarantee. This so-called partial peace, where the people's lives have no freedom and the army has no guarantee, is a completely sinister and vicious scam, and a serious lesson of fact. It proves that the so-called promotion of partial peace and learning from Beiping, which is touted by the CCP's propaganda machine, is completely unacceptable and impossible. The military and civilians of the country have been deceived once and will not be deceived again.

(4) Preparing for War to Speak of Peace, Only by Being Able to Fight Can We Have Peace: Today, when the CCP is carrying out the war to the end and attempting to invade the Yangtze River, ignoring the government's sincerity in peace talks, in addition to adhering to the policy of peace and striving for peace, the government, in view of the terrible nature of the local scam in Beiping, in order to obtain a true peace that is equal, comprehensive, and conditional, the government can only actively prepare for war in order to speak of peace, and only by "being able to fight can we have peace." At present, the military officers and soldiers of our country are deeply aware of this, especially the Yangtze River defense troops. The morale is extremely high, and all officers and soldiers are indignant and vow to fight the CCP to the death. In addition, the Yangtze River is a natural barrier, and the army, navy, and air force cooperate in combat. It is extremely difficult for the enemy to fly across the Yangtze River with its main force. The National Army has taken the initiative in the offensive and defensive along the coast and is fully prepared. It will not fall into the same isolated and helpless situation as Jinan, Fanyang, Changchun, Jinzhou, Pingjin, and other places. If the Communist Army wants to force its way across the Yangtze River, it will suffer a tragic defeat in the middle of the river. In addition, the people in the provinces and cities south of the Yangtze River, seeing that the Communist Party has no sincerity for peace, especially the terrible and shameful nature of local peace talks, have generally aroused anger and have risen to organize self-defense, assist the National Army, and support the front line. If the Communist Party still does not restrain its heart of exhaustion and military force, then our government, while vigorously advocating peace and promoting peace, and hoping for the early realization of comprehensive peace, will not hesitate to sacrifice everything to protect the safety and freedom of life and property of the military and civilians of the country, and will deal with the Communist Party to the end, until the Communist Party realizes to cease fire and achieve true peace.

### The Four Powers Reopen Negotiations on the Austrian State Treaty; Soviet Union Supports Yugoslavia's Territorial Demands; United States Firmly Rejects Modifying Austrian Borders

[United Press London, 9th] The foreign ministers' representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union inaugurated their third attempt to draft the Austrian State Treaty today at Lancaster House in London. Soviet representative immediately proposed that the conference adopt Yugoslavia's territorial demands on Austria, which has consistently requested Austria to cede a large part of the province of Carinthia. This meeting of the foreign ministers' representatives will give Premier Stalin an opportunity to demonstrate whether his peaceful rhetoric aligns with his actions.

[This newspaper's report] London, 9th Broadcast: When the four powers' deputies met today, the Soviet Union supported Yugoslavia's territorial demands on Austria. The arrangement of this meeting was originally intended to allow the dispute between Tito and the Soviet Union and other Cominform countries to shift the situation, but when the four powers' deputies reconvened after a nine-month recess, friction between the East and West re-emerged. Within an hour of the meeting's commencement, it seemed to revert to the situation when it adjourned on May 6th of last year. The meeting adjourned without result, and even the initial agenda issue was not resolved. U.S. representative Reber criticized the Soviet Union's proposal, saying that it was useless to raise Yugoslavia's demands again, as the United States did not intend to consider changing Austria's borders again. In addition, the Soviet Union also suggested incorporating into the Austrian State Treaty the point that the four powers guarantee Austria's borders. Reber said that a general guarantee for Austria was still needed, but he was willing to abandon the clause that the four powers should convene a meeting when Austria was threatened.

[United Press London, 9th] As the four powers began negotiations on the Austrian State Treaty again, Western countries urged the Soviet Union on the 9th to show a spirit of compromise. The representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union recently held a closed-door meeting to overcome the disputes that have hindered the Austrian State Treaty for three years. Western representatives warned in advance that they had no new proposals to make, but they arranged for the Soviet Union to make a general opening statement, indicating whether the Soviet Union was prepared to compromise. There are disputes between the East and the West in all aspects of global contention, but both sides acknowledge that the most dangerous conflict concerns the border issue between Austria and Yugoslavia. The previous treaty negotiations broke down on this point. The Soviet Union had insisted that Austria should cede 728 square miles of land to Yugoslavia, but the Western countries rejected this proposal, and the four powers interrupted their efforts to conclude the treaty on May 6th of last year. At the beginning of today's meeting, U.S. representative Reber said that the United States would never accept Yugoslavia's territorial demands, and unless the Soviet Union gave way on this issue, an agreement seemed hopeless. However, the Soviet Union will probably insist on the territorial issue for the time being as a bargaining tool. The 18 points of contention in the draft Austrian State Treaty include possible guarantees for Austria's independence, the disposition of displaced persons, minor military clauses, and Austria's reparations to the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, etc.

### The Marshall Plan Achieves Significant Success; Truman Expresses Optimism; Believes the Factor of Time Favors the United States

[United Press Washington, 9th] President Truman is more optimistic about the current international situation than he was a few months ago. This hope is not based on any particular recent developments, but mostly on the gradual success of the Marshall Plan and the countries outside the Iron Curtain in Europe. This optimistic attitude of the President is expressed by his closest advisors. The President believes that any day without war is a day of peace. According to one of the President's confidential advisors, he believes that the factor of time favors the United States, and the longer the world goes without war, the less likely war is to break out.

Regarding recent incidents such as the Soviet Union's oppression of Norway, he believes that the Soviet Union is signaling rather than threatening. A well-informed source said, "He (referring to Truman) was never fooled by Stalin's 'peace offensive.' He saw from the beginning that this was clearly a propaganda offensive. Soviet officials never spoke to him about meeting with Stalin."

Sacrificing Political Gains to Avoid World War

No statement made by the President has been more sincere than his repeated affirmation that "all I hope for is peace in the world." People who have known the President for many years say that he would be willing to sacrifice any domestic political gain to avoid a world war. The President receives a highly confidential summary of the latest world developments from government intelligence officials every morning. Truman is an extreme optimist. He is well aware of the delicacy of the current situation, but he believes that the people of the countries that have received U.S. economic aid are pro-American, and he firmly believes that the United Nations must succeed. He also believes that most people in the world believe his declaration that "the United States has no territorial or imperialistic ambitions, and what it hopes for is the freedom, equality, and independence of all mankind."

### Acheson Delivers a Speech; Urges European Unity

### Acheson Condemns Hungary's Persecution of the Church

Will Submit the Mindszenty Case to the United Nations

[This newspaper's report] Washington, 9th Broadcast: Acheson today strongly condemned the Hungarian government's unjust sentencing of Bishop Mindszenty to life imprisonment at a press conference. Acheson said that this action by the Soviet-controlled Hungarian government was a disregard for conscience, persecuting the church in an attempt to remove anti-communist moral forces. Acheson said: The Hungarian people have no real freedom to speak of. Acheson also warned that the Hungarian government should bear full responsibility for this action. In addition to being submitted to the United Nations for handling, there are other ways to deal with this case, but Acheson declined to elaborate on the content of his so-called "other ways."

### Swedish Foreign Minister States: Determined to Maintain Neutrality

[Agence France-Presse Stockholm, 9th] Swedish Foreign Minister Undén told Parliament that the failure of the negotiations on the Scandinavian Defense Pact is an indication that the Swedish government is maintaining its consistent position of not participating in the Cold War. He mentioned that in 1948, he suggested to Norway and Denmark that they conclude a ten-year mutual assistance alliance, with the principle of maintaining collective neutrality, and its main purpose was also to keep the three countries out of war. He also said that the point of divergence between Sweden and Norway is that Norway wants to obtain the guarantee of Western powers. In conclusion, Sweden is determined to maintain its traditional policy of neutrality.

### United States and Canada Will Discuss the Issue of Newfoundland Bases

[Agence France-Presse Ottawa, 9th] Canadian Prime Minister St. Laurent said at the group meeting that the U.S. base issue in Newfoundland is one of the issues he will discuss with Truman in Washington this weekend. According to the treaty, the Newfoundland base was leased by Canada to the United States during World War II for a period of ninety-nine years. Now that Newfoundland is about to merge with Canada to form a federal province, this leased base will involve the issue of Canadian sovereignty.

### The Soviet Union Repeats Old Tune; Re-Proposes Disarmament Proposals; Attacks Western Defense Alliances

[United Press Lake Success, 8th] The Soviet Union on the 8th demanded that the Security Council condemn the Western network of regional defense pacts and schemes to increase armaments, and ordered the United States to publicly disclose its stockpile of atomic bombs within seven weeks. Soviet representative Malik proposed a proposal that was revived from a previous failed Soviet proposal, which called for an immediate one-third reduction in the armaments and military forces of the five powers of China, the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and the destruction of all atomic bombs, as the first important step in disarmament.

Western representatives quickly defended the Atlantic Pact, which Malik concentrated his attack on, and bluntly condemned the Soviet Union's new disarmament initiative. Malik argued that these regional pacts were "led by aggressors from certain powerful countries, whose purpose is to impose their aggressive policies on other countries, and for this purpose, they are increasing the production of weapons and establishing naval and air bases around the world, which are absolutely inconsistent with the true interests of the countries concerned." Malik charged that these "aggressors" are carrying out a new war. U.S. representative Austin replied that these regional defense pacts were fully in line with the principles of the United Nations and were for "peaceful purposes." He condemned the Soviet Union's proposal as "crude food." The Soviet Union's recent disarmament proposal was doomed to failure from the start. British representative Cadogan coldly stated that the Soviet Union's attempt to revive its failed plan was "a waste of time." At this point, the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting until next Thursday.

### Seven Countries Hold Plenary Meeting to Discuss the North Atlantic Security Pact; Denmark Hopes to Conclude a North Regional Alliance

[United Press Washington, 8th] The negotiations for the seven-nation North Atlantic Security Pact were held in plenary session with Secretary of State Acheson at the State Department on the 8th. This was Acheson's first gathering with the entire group since January 14th. Belgian Ambassador Silvercruys said, "We continue what we have not finished." It is not yet known whether the results of the meeting will be made public.

[Agence France-Presse London, 8th] According to well-informed sources, the Atlantic Pact will be signed in Washington or Bermuda. It is not yet known when this ceremony will be held, but most diplomatic observers here believe that British Foreign Secretary Bevin may continue to cross the Atlantic to participate in the ceremony in the middle of next month.

[Agence France-Presse Copenhagen, 9th] The Danish Foreign Minister told Parliament that the Danish government believes that concluding a Scandinavian defense alliance based on the principle of mutual assistance and considering whether it is possible to receive the necessary military equipment from Western countries, while not providing guarantees to other countries at the same time, is the best way to ensure the security of the three Nordic countries. It is expected that the Danish ambassador to Italy will soon meet with Acheson to discuss Denmark's possible participation in the Atlantic Pact.

### Railway Strike Once Again Suffers Setbacks; Passenger Trains on Both Lines Can Resume Today; Four Points of Agreement Reached on New Demands Made by Employees; Method of Adjusting Benefits to be Announced on the 14th

[This newspaper's report] The railway strike came to a temporary end the night before last, and after passenger trains resumed running at midnight, passenger trains from Beijing and Hangzhou to Shanghai that were blocked at various stations the day before yesterday also arrived in Shanghai one after another yesterday morning. At the same time, thirteen passenger trains left Shanghai for Beijing and Hangzhou. By 2 p.m., another setback occurred. Workers from the locomotive depot and the engineering department invited the entire staff of the transportation department and the North Station to strike and petition the Bureau of Railways, so traffic on both lines was suspended again from 2 p.m. After much mediation, the strike was quelled at 5:15 p.m., and work resumed at 6 p.m. The trains scheduled to depart this morning successively departed after 6 p.m., and passenger trains on both lines are expected to gradually return to normal starting today.

Yesterday morning, although some workers worked as usual, other workers gathered at the Workers' Club to discuss and plan to continue fighting for benefits. By 2 p.m., the plan had matured, and a large group of workers went along the tracks to the North Station and the North Station Building, inviting all the staff on the station and in the building to strike and petition the Bureau of Railways.

### Diesel Fuel Not Purchased by Deadline Reassigned to Other Users

[Our Report] News from the Transportation Management Committee's Oil Allocation Committee: Recently, the imported quantity of diesel fuel has been reduced, and supply has repeatedly been out of sync. The fuel for various industries in December of last year and January of this year was allocated together in order to adapt to the actual situation and simplify procedures, which was originally not what was desired. Currently, among various industry users, there are a considerable number who have not purchased fuel from the designated oil company after receiving the fuel allocation notice, while users in urgent need feel there is no oil to buy, resulting in stagnant oil volume and unbalanced supply and demand, which is not fair. In order to regulate supply and demand, the committee will shorten the fuel purchase deadline. If the oil is not purchased from the oil company after the prescribed deadline, the original fuel allocation notice will be cancelled, so that this quota can be reassigned to other users awaiting allocation. However, if the oil company is unable to supply within the deadline, the oil company may indicate this on the back of the fuel allocation order, allowing for an extension.

### Shanghai Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association Requests That Transportation of Cotton Yarn to the South Not Be Restricted

Recently, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce telegraphed the US Aid Cotton Yarn Joint Management Office to resume the measures implemented by the former Yarn Management Committee to restrict the transportation of cotton yarn to the south. Although the amount of yarn restricted for transportation to the south was not stipulated, the Jianghai Customs has been implementing the above order since the fourth day. Currently, the transportation of cotton yarn to the south has been completely suspended. The Shanghai Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association believes that with the current state of war and peace undecided, Shanghai is approaching the front lines, North China's transportation is completely cut off, and Yangtze River shipping has also been suspended, the only remaining sales channel for cotton yarn is the South China route. Even the cotton yarn needed by provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi must be transshipped through South China. According to South China's cotton yarn production, the amount is very small, and it has always relied on Shanghai's supply. Now that the need is even greater, the transportation of cotton yarn to the south should be encouraged to meet the needs. Now it is doing the opposite, actually implementing restrictions on the transportation of cotton yarn to the south, which is tantamount to hindering the source of cotton yarn in South China, forcing an imbalance between supply and demand, and creating market panic. Moreover, the dyeing and weaving industry in Shanghai is already facing difficulties in maintaining operations due to rising prices, increased expenses, and sluggish sales. If transportation to the south is restricted, factories will inevitably collapse immediately due to the interruption of sales. The livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of workers will be cut off, and the impact on social order is particularly concerning. Yesterday, separate telegrams were sent to Mayor Wu, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the Shanghai Industrial Association, forwarding them to the Executive Yuan, urging them to promptly instruct the US Aid Cotton Yarn Joint Transport Office and Jianghai Customs to stop implementing restrictions on the transportation of cotton yarn to the south, restore free transportation, and maintain production.

### Cotton Yarn Prices Decline

Cotton yarn sales are mediocre, and there are still many who want to sell off their goods due to the tight money supply. Those in need of funds voluntarily sell off to reduce interest burdens. With supply exceeding demand in the market, prices are slightly soft, and the market is unable to support them, fluctuating downwards. 42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 360,000 yuan and was bid up to a high of 375,000 yuan, but because buyers were all hesitant to come forward, prices declined again, closing at a low of 350,000 yuan, down 40,000 yuan from the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix fell by 45,000 yuan, and 32-count Silver Moon fell from 315,000 yuan to close at 285,000 yuan, a drop of 35,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse spot goods initially opened at 215,000 yuan, once being inflated to 245,000 yuan, but near the close, they fell again, closing at 220,000 yuan, down 25,000 yuan from the previous day. Factory orders were at 200,000 yuan, with arbitrage for one-day terms reaching a high of 13,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse dropped by 15,000 yuan, closing at 200,500 yuan. There were few transactions in remaining yarn, and prices were also depressed.

The cotton cloth market turned weak, and prices followed suit. Because direct sales were sluggish and sentiment was weak, coupled with the tight money supply, buyers were very reluctant to buy, resulting in price relaxation and market depression. However, after positive news spread, sentiment recovered, and various cloths saw progress again. Longtou fine cloth was quoted at around 1,800 yuan at noon, but there were very few transactions. Laba Tong fine cloth opened at 7,100 yuan, down 450 yuan from the previous day. B-Longtou fine cloth initially opened at 6,700 yuan, reached a high of 6,900 yuan, but then retreated to close at 6,500 yuan, down 200 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji and Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance Yuan Biji fell all the way from 7,900 yuan to a low of 7,400 yuan, and then recovered to 8,100 yuan near the close, finally closing at 8,000 yuan, down 200 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong initially opened at 7,750 yuan, fell to 7,300 yuan midway, recovered to 7,800 yuan at noon, but was still down 100 yuan from the previous day. Other cloths also saw slight declines.

### Textile Construction Continues to Dump Inventory

[Our Report] Yesterday, China Textile Construction Company continued to dump yarn on behalf of the National Bank and other institutions. A total of 51 lots of 20-count yarn were offered. As a result, 123 households were approved for purchase, totaling 610 lots, worth 119,610,000 yuan. The selling price was calculated as 195,000 yuan for each lot of 20-count Grade A cotton yarn (Double Globe, Golden Rooster, Angel, Golden City, Pisces, Red Bell), and 200,000 yuan for each lot of Gan Gan Gan Li Ma.

In addition, the company sold yarn as usual yesterday, approving purchases for 79 households, totaling 144 lots, worth 44,690,000 yuan. The selling price for each lot of yarn was calculated as 167,000 yuan for 15-count Zhuan Nian, 175,000 yuan for 16-count Red Moon, 188,000 yuan for 21-count Fairy Peach Grade B, 250,000 yuan for 32-count Yang He, 480,000 yuan for 40-count TK Sunlight, 310,000 yuan for 40-count Red Jewel Light, 325,000 yuan for 40-count Three-Strand Red Jewel Light and 42-count Double-Strand Red Li Ma, 370,000 yuan for 42-count Double-Strand Mercerized Color Ball, 480,000 yuan for 60-count Palace Maid, and 1,000,000 yuan for 80-count Double-Strand TK Color Ball.

### Tight Credit Situation Worsens

The trend of tight credit in this city was even more apparent yesterday morning. The interest rates for all industries and markets rose uniformly, averaging around 70 yuan. Only the rice market had a lower price, around 60 yuan. The rubber and cloth markets, on the other hand, fluctuated, initially high and then low, averaging 60 to 65 yuan by noon. The silk market was exceptionally high, once reaching around 75 yuan. The National Bank's rediscount and daily interest rates remained unchanged.

Amidst the recent reports of tight credit in the city, there have been strong rumors in the market that various banks and bureaus are delaying payments for remittances to Shanghai from various regions. National Bank officials formally denied these rumors yesterday morning in response to reporters' inquiries. They stated: "These market rumors are completely unfounded. All national banks and bureaus handle remittance payments according to established procedures and there are no delays. The tightness of credit in the market is a natural consequence of the government's recent dumping of large quantities of goods." They also believed that this phenomenon might continue for several days.

### Authorities Still Dumping Inventory Yesterday, Rice Prices Continue to Decline, White Indica and Thin Rice Close at 6,500 Yuan

Yesterday's off-site rice prices fell again. Due to tight credit, many cargo owners were eager to sell, but sales were slow. Although rice shops replenished their stocks, the quantities were small. With limited sales channels, prices fell. Prices initially dropped by about 200-300 yuan, and then fell further due to excess supply and sluggish demand. White indica and thin rice closed at 6,500 yuan, and early rice at 6,300 yuan, each falling by 500 yuan. The government dumped 5,000 dan of rice yesterday.

Flour

Prices initially fell and then rebounded. At the beginning of the market, due to tighter credit, dealers dumped large quantities of flour, causing panic. Old brand flour initially retreated to the 3,000 yuan level. During the middle of the market, it briefly traded at 2,850 yuan. Near the close, cargo owners were unwilling to sell and buyers became more enthusiastic, causing prices to rise slightly, with transactions at 2,900 yuan. Military Ship brand flour initially opened at 2,800 yuan, traded as low as 2,700 yuan in the middle of the market, and closed at 2,820 yuan. The prices of other miscellaneous brand flour fell below 3,000 yuan across the board.

Grains

Raw peanuts were oversupplied and undersold, falling by 25%. Nanjing raw peanuts fell below the 10,000 yuan mark. Corn and Qingbang varieties saw weak demand, falling by over 10%. Huangdu corn closed at 2,500 yuan. Red sorghum followed the downward trend. Only picked Qing saw an upward trend.

Cooking Oil

Prices fell due to tight credit. External commodity prices were uniformly lower, and market sentiment was pessimistic. There were few buyers, while sellers continued to supply. Prices fell due to oversupply and weak demand. Soybean oil fell below 30,000 yuan, closing at 29,000 yuan, a drop of 4,500 yuan. Raw rapeseed oil closed at 24,000 yuan, a drop of 3,000 yuan. Raw oil fell by 3,500 yuan. Jibao raw oil opened at 33,500 yuan. Cooked rapeseed oil and other oils fell by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Soybean cakes were oversupplied and undersold, with prices falling by 500 yuan.

### Small Silk Market

The silk market yesterday continued to hover around the same levels, with prices initially falling slightly and then rising. Credit in the market tightened, with black market interest rates reaching as high as 75 yuan. Many floating orders were sold off, while silk weavers' demand was slack. The market initially weakened and then stabilized.

No. 120 Tianqiao initially opened at 290,000 yuan. Later, loose orders were released, and prices fell again, dropping as low as 275,000 yuan. In the middle of the day, credit tightened and then eased slightly. End users aggressively bought at lower prices, and the market quickly stabilized. It recovered to 300,000 yuan at noon. Next-day settlement traded at 325,000 yuan.

The raw silk market declined yesterday, with very weak sentiment. Initially, due to tight credit, black market interest rates rose, and long positions were sold off. Later, rumors circulated that the China Trust Bureau would dump inventory again, putting further pressure on the market. There were more sellers than buyers in the market, and prices fell at the close. Superior grade raw silk initially saw 340,000 yuan, once falling back to 20,000 yuan. After the low, rumors circulated that the exchange transfer certificate trend was slightly stronger, and the silk market weakened and then stabilized. Dealers held firm, and finally closed at 330,000 yuan at noon, a fall of 20,000 yuan.

The silk fabric market saw a slight rise. Although black market interest rates were high, there were still many long positions supporting the market. The market was unwilling to fall significantly, and saw a slight rise at the noon close. Mei Ya bed covers initially traded at 193,000 yuan, fluctuating slightly in the middle, rising and falling by around 5,000 yuan. By the noon close, due to weak closing performance, stocks were sold and purchases made, and buying interest became stronger. Market sentiment saw a slightly positive sign, and asking prices gradually rose back, finally closing at 194,000 yuan.

### Tea Market Asking Prices Rise

The red market in tea, which had been holding steady for many days, resumed a stalemate yesterday after opening on the 8th of this month. Although credit tightened, market interest rates rose, and downstream materials outside the circle were weak, dealers felt that tea stocks were almost exhausted, and insisted on holding onto their goods, believing that rare commodities were profitable. Asking prices continued to rise. As a result, even if buyers were willing, it was difficult to fulfill their wishes, and transactions were difficult to complete. Market sentiment remained quiet but gradually strengthened, and the foundation remained quite solid.
