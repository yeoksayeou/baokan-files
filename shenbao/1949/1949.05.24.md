### Naval and Air Forces Assist in the Offensive: Pudong Battles Gradually Reach a Climax; National Army Advances on Three Major Fronts

[Central News Agency, This City] Navy Headquarters News: Our Navy's X Fleet (23rd) launched a fierce attack in the morning, cooperating with the Army to intercept the bandit army attacking Gaoqiao. The bandit army at important strongholds on the left and right wings of Gaoqiao, such as Chenjiaqiao and Yangjiazhai, were completely defeated. Our Army is taking advantage of the momentum to launch a fierce attack. After our Navy assisted the Army in fiercely attacking the above-mentioned strongholds, it also blocked the bandits' retreat. In this battle, our XX ship Captain Chen Qingkun and XX ship Captain Qiu Zhongming both used blitzkrieg tactics, using the most effective firepower to carry out destructive firing on the bandits at extremely close range to the river bank. The bandits suffered heavy casualties and retreated along the above-mentioned strongholds.

[Central News Agency, This City] Military News: On the 23rd, fierce battles took place throughout the Pudong district of Shanghai. In the morning, due to low clouds and rain, the activities of most of the naval air force were severely restricted. In the afternoon, the clouds were high and the weather cleared, and a large number of aircraft flew to the line of Gaoqiao, Yangjing, and Tangqiao in Pudong to assist the Army in its offensive. The stubborn bandits were immediately suppressed by us, and by evening, our army had achieved the expected progress on the above three major fronts.

[Central News Agency, This City] Military News: (1) On the Gaoqiao front in Pudong, at 11:00 am on the 23rd, after our attacking troops successively captured Chenjiadang, the right wing went straight to the line of Yinjiaqiao, Zhongzhai, Lujiazhai, and Chenjiadang. The left wing is still engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits in Chenwang Sanzhai.

[Central News Agency, This City] Military News at 9:30 am on the 23rd: (1) In the Pudong area, after two days of heroic counterattacks by the defending troops and the continuous arrival of reinforcements from our XX and other units to the front line, the battle has gradually reached a climax. At around 1:00 am on the 23rd, our main defense zone east of Lujiazhao and Yangjing Town resumed fierce fighting. More than 3,000 bandits, braving the blazing firepower, launched a fierce attack on us in the dark, dividing their forces. After three hours of fierce fighting, the bandits suffered hundreds of casualties. By dawn, the remaining bandits had all entered our pre-arranged pocket formation and are currently being encircled and annihilated by our army. (2) In the Battle of Gaoqiao, after our XX unit of reinforcements, in coordination with the local garrison, inflicted heavy losses on the bandits, the area has become the largest graveyard for the bandits attacking Pudong. The main force of the bandit's 30th Army has been almost completely lost after two days of fighting. Their subsequent units, the 31st, 20th, and 33rd armies, successively reinforced on the 22nd and 23rd, and drove many innocent civilians to act as human shields. However, due to the joint operations of our army, navy, and air force, the bandits' dream of swallowing this important stronghold in Pudong in an attempt to cut off our Songhu (Shanghai-Wusong) lifeline had to be shattered. By around 7:00 am on the 23rd, a certain unit of our defending troops had switched to an active offensive, and simultaneously launched attacks in multiple directions. The battle is still in progress.

[Central News Agency, This City] Military News: Telephone from Pudong at 12:00 noon on the 23rd: (1) From 9:00 pm on the 22nd, the bandits concentrated all their strength from the 29th, 30th, and 31st armies, as well as the Beihai, Nanjing, and Shanghai Columns, and the Zhejiang Brigade, and launched an attack on our army's positions in the direction of Huangjiazhai, Yangjing Town, Dajinzhai, and Longzheng Temple. The fighting was particularly fierce in the Dajinzhai area. (2) A group of bandits who sneaked into Dajinzhai, Huangjiazhai, and other places on the night of the 22nd took advantage of the dimness of the night to sneak into the positions of one of our units. Our mobile unit counter-encircled the bandits, putting them in a dilemma, and used fierce firepower to sandwich them, annihilating all the bandits who had sneaked into our positions, leaving more than 400 corpses behind and fleeing in a panic. Another group of bandits launched a foolish attack on our Tangqiao positions from the right wing, but were also repelled by our army's fierce firepower. The bandits, out of desperation, adopted their self-proclaimed triumphant human wave tactics, launching a full-scale wave charge on us. The fierce fighting continued until 12:00 noon yesterday, and was still taking place fiercely in the Dajinzhai and other areas. (3) Luo, the commander of our garrison in the Dajinzhai and Tangqiao area, personally went to the front line to supervise the battle in order to encourage his comrades to bravely annihilate the bandits, and decided not to easily give up the opportunity to kill the enemy. It is said that the bandits are now being encircled and annihilated.

[Central News Agency, This City] Military News: Telephone from the front line at 8:00 am on the 23rd, summarizing the battle results: After the bandit army's attack on the area north of the Yunzaobang to the Yangtze River was crushed, they regrouped the forces of four armies to attack Pudong, attempting to cross Gaoqiao and cut off the Wusong lifeline. For five days, the bandits rushed around like wild boars, and their arrogance was quite high. After our army, navy, and air force respectively inflicted heavy blows on them, they are now blocked in the area between Yangjing and Gaoqiao. Under the pressure of our various strong firepowers, more than 20,000 bandits have been annihilated. The remnants of each division of their 30th and 31st armies are less than a regiment in number. After making one last, largest struggle in the past two days, they are no longer able to attack. The battles on that line have now come to a standstill. On the eleventh day of the Battle of Shanghai, the bandits' second key point of attack was again broken, and our army is becoming more and more courageous in battle, and our confidence is becoming more and more firm. It is obvious that the foundation for defending Shanghai has been laid.

### Fierce Fighting on the Yuepu and Liuhang Line; Garrison Troops in Southern Shanghai Launch Annihilation Offensive; Communist Army Fails to Capture Jinjiazhai in Nanxiang

[Central News Agency, This City] Military News: (1) More than 2,000 bandits in Xiluqiao and Wuzhai, southwest of Yuepu, began to attack our garrison's positions at 5:30 pm on the 23rd. The officers and soldiers of a certain unit of our garrison, holding the spirit of "I will not coexist with bandits, and if there are bandits, there will be no me," heroically counterattacked. The bandits suffered heavy casualties. As of the time of this dispatch, the two sides are still engaged in fierce fighting. (2) At 8:10 pm on the 23rd, the garrison troops in Laozhai, east of Liuhang and southwest of Yanghang, engaged in fierce fighting with the invading bandits. The rumbling artillery fire heard from the outskirts of Shanghai at dusk was said to have been fired by our army.

[Central News Agency, This City] On the line from Liuhang and Yanghang to Yuepu, our army continued to send out strong troops to launch attacks in multiple directions on the 23rd in order to maintain the initiative. The bandit army was like a frightened bird and rarely resisted stubbornly. Therefore, there were only small local contacts throughout the 23rd.

[Central News Agency, This City] Telephone from the Yuepu front at 9:00 am on the 23rd: The bandits in the Yuepu, Yanghang, Liuhang, and other positions have been heavily hit by us for days, are exhausted, and no longer have the ability to fight. It is judged that their remnants may be adjusted and replenished in an attempt to attack again. Therefore, the battle situation has been very quiet in recent days, except for minor contacts. The entire night of the 22nd was also like a state of rest. Our garrison is currently taking advantage of the rare spare time to raise their vigilance, strengthen their fortifications, and review the gains and losses of this operation in order to prepare to attack the bandit remnants and inflict a fatal blow on them.

[Central News Agency, This City] Military News: The bandits in the southern Shanghai area returned in force on the afternoon of the 23rd. The fighting was quite fierce for a time on the line of Xinqiao, Qibao, and Lujia Lane. However, according to reliable reports, the combat effectiveness of the bandit army on this line is not worth paying attention to. Its strategic significance is probably to echo the offensives in Pudong and northwestern Shanghai. The garrison there had made strong preparations early on and is currently launching an annihilation attack on the four regiments of invading bandits.

[Central News Agency, This City] Military News at 9:30 am on the 23rd: After our advancing stronghold in Qibao, southwestern Shanghai, was actively evacuated by the garrison at considerable cost, the bandits were lured to the front of our main position, and with artillery and air cover, we concentrated our firepower to counterattack. In the afternoon of the 22nd, our tank unit was ordered to reinforce. The bandits, suffering heavy casualties, scurried back towards Qibao and are currently under our strict encirclement.

[Central News Agency, This City] Military News: Telephone from the Luhang front at 6:00 pm on the 23rd: A group of about 200 bandits from Nanxiang attacked the positions of a certain unit of our army in Jinjiazhai at 1:30 am on the 23rd, taking advantage of the darkness of the night. We lured them to the vicinity of Luzhai and then unleashed all our firepower, giving the bandits a head-on blow. The fierce fighting continued until about 4:00 am. The bandits gradually felt overwhelmed. We seized the opportunity and immediately dispatched elite garrison troops, with one unit flanking the bandits from the left wing. The bandits were attacked on both sides and were immediately thrown into confusion. We took advantage of the victory to break into the bandit formation and inflict a heavy blow on them. The bandits suffered heavy casualties, with corpses piled up everywhere. The remaining bandits fled in panic. In this battle, more than 100 bandits were killed, 13 were captured alive, and 12 submachine guns and more than 100 rifles were seized. Only five of our officers and soldiers were injured, and the position remained secure.

### Garrison Troops' Fighting Spirit Demonstrates Inherent Martial Virtues

[Central News Agency, This City] Military News: In the past eleven days of combat, our garrison troops have demonstrated a high degree of fighting spirit and displayed the inherent martial virtues of soldiers. For example, the position of a certain company west of Yuepu was once captured by the bandits. After a heroic battle, all the officers and soldiers of the company sacrificed themselves heroically, and no one retreated. The position was recaptured by our counterattack one hour later. Also, when the position west of Yanghang was captured by the bandits, the officers and soldiers of a certain company guarding the area vowed to coexist and die with the position, persisting to the last man and the last bullet. Later, reinforcements arrived to counterattack, and the entire group of bandits was annihilated. Furthermore, when the forward stronghold south of Gaoqiao was captured by the bandits, a certain company commander of ours resolved not to coexist with the bandits and defended it until the last minute. All the brothers in the company died for the country, and he also committed suicide to achieve benevolence. Under the power jointly exerted by the national army, navy, and air force, the bandit army uses the backward and brutal human wave charge tactic, not hesitating to use human lives as human shields, but the sacrifice is great and the success is small (the ratio of bandit to our casualties is ten to one). Their soldiers are extremely weary of war and afraid of war. Those who sneak into our pocket formations are mostly willing to lay down their weapons and surrender to the national army.

### Radio Fundraising to Comfort the Troops; All Circles Actively Contribute

[Central News Agency, This City] Yesterday was the second day of the radio fundraising campaign launched by the City Comfort Committee to comfort the troops. In addition to the participation of Weiyang Opera, ballad singers Fan Xueping, Zhu Shuizhao, Yuan Xuefen, Xu Yulan, etc., there were also broadcasts by Gu Zhenggang, Standing Committee Member of the Political Affairs Committee, Mayor Chen, Commander Chen's representative Zhang Taixiang, and Li Dasan, Chairman of the Special Party Department of the Two Routes, etc., to promote the significance of raising funds to comfort the troops. Fang Zhi, Chairman of the Comfort Committee, personally presided over and made a second appeal for fundraising broadcasts, and the situation was extremely enthusiastic.

In addition, the association will continue to entrust various radio stations to continue reporting and raising funds to comfort the troops from today onwards. It is hoped that enthusiastic patriotic people from all walks of life will actively donate. The locations for delivering funds and materials are advertised in major newspapers.

### Gu Zhenggang's Broadcast

[Central News Agency, This City] Gu Zhenggang, Member of the Political Affairs Committee of the Jinghu Hang Garrison Headquarters, broadcast to the citizens of the city yesterday to promote fundraising to comfort the troops, entitled "Encourage Morale with Popular Sentiment." The original text is recorded below:

Fellow citizens of Shanghai! In this Great Shanghai Defense War, the invading Communist bandits in Shizilin, Yuepu, Yanghang, Liuhang, and Qibao in western Shanghai, and Gaoqiao in Pudong, have encountered the heroic and firm resistance of our front-line soldiers everywhere, and none of them have been able to escape the annihilation of our front-line soldiers' predetermined fire nets. In the past ten days, the casualties of the main force of the Communist bandits have reached more than 50,000, and more than 3,000 Communist bandits have been captured, and more than 250 light and heavy machine guns of the Communist bandits have been seized, as well as many other spoils of war. The Communist bandits' crazy offensive has suffered a serious blow. This heroic spirit and brilliant record of the National Army have made this anti-aggression, anti-violence, and striving for national independence and the people's freedom of life in the Shanghai Defense War exert its great significance and supreme value in the international community and in history.

We must expand the fruits of this victory to defeat the Communist bandits and eliminate the Communist bandits. We must have not only heroic morale, but also vigorous popular sentiment. Whether soldiers or people, we should all recognize the significance of the nation above all else and the military above all else, with the goal of victory first, and encourage morale with popular sentiment, and inspire popular sentiment with morale, so that popular sentiment and morale can communicate, share the same hatred, and bravely strive forward. This is the performance of our great national spirit and democratic strength, and it is also the support force for our victory in suppressing bandits and the solid foundation for our victory in suppressing bandits.

Therefore, I want to sincerely call on the people of Shanghai to emulate the contributions of the people of European and American countries to the front-line soldiers. Our fellow compatriots from all walks of life should also do their best to do everything for the front line and everything for victory. Now the soldiers are using their flesh and blood to defend our country, defend our Shanghai, and protect our lives and property. This spirit is so great and worthy of our respect.

I now want to call on the people of all walks of life in Shanghai to be aware of the meaning of "risking your life to protect your life" and "losing your property to protect your property," and to work hard to make the following contributions in the spirit of "those who have money contribute money" and "those who have strength contribute strength":

(1) Fellow compatriots who have assets, such as factory owners, real estate owners, managers of companies, firms, banks, and money houses, and people who hold money, foreign currency, and the middle class, should donate more.

(2) Fellow compatriots who have skills, such as singing, drama, music, art, and other people with expertise, should perform art and raise money and materials to be used to comfort the soldiers, or offer art to the soldiers to appreciate, so that the soldiers can get spiritual comfort after a hundred battles.

(3) Intellectuals and young fellow compatriots should use words or speeches to elaborate the meaning of suppressing bandits, to inspire popular sentiment, or write letters to comfort the soldiers, to encourage morale.

(5) In addition to being able to do the above-mentioned tasks, female fellow compatriots should donate shoes, wash clothes, and do rescue work for the wounded soldiers.

The above-mentioned contributions are the performance of our Shanghai compatriots' love for the country and freedom, and they are also the performance of our Shanghai compatriots' popular sentiment. I hope that our Shanghai compatriots will promote our popular sentiment to cooperate with the heroic morale, to strive for the victory of this defense war.

### Mayor Chen's Broadcast

[Central News Agency, This City] Mayor Chen broadcasted on Shanghai Radio at 6:10 pm yesterday (23rd) to promote the fundraising campaign to comfort the troops. The full text of the broadcast speech is excerpted below: Fellow compatriots: In order to protect the safety of the lives and property of six million citizens, in order to protect five thousand years of inherent culture, and to strive for the independence and freedom of the motherland, in order to uphold justice and maintain world peace, in short, whether for ourselves, for the nation, or for the world, we must resolutely, with one heart, and do everything possible to jointly participate in the work of defending Great Shanghai.

Counting from the beginning of the Shanghai Defense War, it has entered its second ten days today. For more than ten days, our strong army, great air force, and navy that dominates East Asia have all fought bravely together with the spirit of having me without an enemy, regardless of rain or shine, day or night, braving the harsh weather, braving the hail of bullets, and gloriously killing the enemy. Sometimes, for the sake of a little bit of contention, we do not hesitate to take the lead in fighting, and fight bloody battles. In the minds of the general officers and soldiers, there is only success, not failure. Even if they break their arms and legs, they must heal their wounds and fight again, and those who must return to the hospital for treatment will immediately go to the front line again after they recover, fulfilling their duty to protect the country and the people. This earth-shattering, tear-jerking, indomitable, and commendable fact of loyalty and courage can be said to be the development and promotion of the spirit of sacrifice and struggle during the Xinhai Revolution and the War of Resistance Against Japan. It is expected that it will continue to exert great power, eliminate the enemy, and return our freedom, and the time should not be far away.

However, military-civilian cooperation is a necessary condition for victory. All the officers and soldiers of our army, navy, and air force have fulfilled their mission of killing the enemy on the front line. All six million citizens should jointly participate in the sacred work of defending Great Shanghai. Under the principle of contributing strength if there is strength and contributing money if there is money, we must do our best to raise, donate, transport, and supply the supplies necessary for the combat of all officers and soldiers, as well as the supplies necessary for the life and medical care of all officers and soldiers. Furthermore, under the principle of everything for the front line and everything for victory, it is not an exaggeration to unconditionally contribute all our manpower, material resources, and financial resources to the front line. There is no distinction between workers, farmers, businessmen, or students, and there is no distinction between men, women, old, or young. Everyone has a share in defending Great Shanghai, and everyone has a responsibility, and everyone's aspirations can become a city.

Fellow compatriots, losing property can protect property, and risking your life can protect your life. Now is the time for the people in the rear to lose property to defend their homes and themselves. I deeply hope that all citizens will raise and donate everything, sacrifice everything, and work together to defend Great Shanghai. Finally, I wish you all good health.

### Fang Zhi's Broadcast Speech

[Central News Agency, This City] Fang Zhi, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, broadcasted to the citizens of this city yesterday to promote the fundraising campaign to comfort the troops, entitled "The Communist Bandits' Attack on Shanghai Has Failed." The original text is recorded below:

Yesterday, my brother made a broadcast to the city to report that "the Communist bandits dug their own graves in Shanghai," and reported the situation of the Communist bandits' disastrous defeat. Today, I am even more excited to tell you that the Communist bandits' offensives in Pudong and Liuhang Yanghang have now completely collapsed.

The strength of the Communist bandits is really nothing remarkable. The achievements in Pudong, after two days of heroic counterattacks by our army and the reinforcements of our XX and other units to the front line, the battle entered its climax. In particular, the Battle of Gaoqiao gave the attacking bandits the greatest blow. It can be said that most of the main force of the bandits' 30th Army has been lost. The bandits' dream of swallowing this important stronghold in Pudong in an attempt to cut off our Songhu lifeline had to be shattered. Now I can report to you that the casualties of the Communist bandits have increased from 50,000 to 70,000, and the number of prisoners has increased from 3,000 to 5,000. Tonight, I believe we can achieve great results. These glorious and great victories are all due to the enthusiasm of the people from all walks of life in Shanghai to comfort the soldiers. The front-line soldiers, with the enthusiastic support of our city's compatriots, have made them encouraged and happy, and have strengthened their brave spirit in combat. What is especially valuable is that some innocent children take their saved candy money to comfort the troops, and there are also some enthusiastic "anonymous people" who only want to donate money and do not want to leave their names. They have donated many materials and funds, which is really very commendable. And what is most worthy of our praise is that friendly people also generously donated money enthusiastically, which shows that the interests of this Shanghai Defense War are not only in maintaining the freedom, property, life and happiness of Shanghai citizens, but also that international people are giving it great sympathy.

Under the major premise that everything is for the front line, everything is for the soldiers, and everything is for suppressing bandits, the enthusiastic labor army performance of our rear personnel is deeply moving the hearts of the brave soldiers fighting on the front line. When we went to comfort the troops, their simple and powerful response to the people in the rear was only one sentence, that is, to "annihilate more bandits to repay the enthusiasm of the citizens of Shanghai." How can we not be encouraged and happy when we hear it? I believe that the Shanghai citizens who love freedom and love the country will show more and greater enthusiasm to continue to comfort the soldiers in order to repay their spirit of bravely killing the enemy for the country.

Fellow compatriots, starting from today, we are preparing to organize a committee to specifically handle and distribute the funds and goods raised for this army of labor. I hope that our six million compatriots in the city will mobilize unanimously and participate in this comfort movement more actively and in unity. Now, when we receive the continuous good news from the front line amidst the rumbling of cannons, we know that the Communist bandits' attack on Shanghai has failed.

### Commander-in-Chief Tang Allocates Another 20,000 Silver Dollars to Reward Officers and Soldiers of Various Ships; Citizens Enthusiastically Comfort Wounded Officers and Soldiers

[Central News Agency, This City] Navy Headquarters News: Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo, in view of the outstanding military achievements of the naval fleet stationed in Shanghai in defending Great Shanghai, has specially allocated another 20,000 silver dollars to reward the meritorious officers and soldiers of various ships. The naval officers and soldiers were extremely excited and vowed to annihilate the bandit army with the greatest determination, so that no one would escape.

[Central News Agency, This City] In recent days, the battles on the front lines have been fierce. In addition to the various joint logistics hospitals in the urban area, Shanghai citizens have spontaneously initiated comfort efforts for our loyal and wounded officers and soldiers. Shen Chunhao, an apprentice at the Fuxing Tobacco Shop in the Yimiao District, was extremely moved by the broken arms and limbs of the wounded officers and soldiers. He specially used his lifetime savings to buy more than 200 baked wheat cakes and personally sent them to the wards to distribute to the wounded. Also, a lady who did not want to reveal her name and address donated biscuits and candies to comfort the wounded officers and soldiers, and personally distributed them clinically. The wounded officers and soldiers were extremely inspired after receiving them, which shows the utmost care and respect of the Shanghai citizens for the wounded soldiers.

### Tokyo American Naval Spokesman Denies Sending Troops to Qingdao; MacArthur's Spokesman Also Denies Equipping Japanese Troops

[United Press Tokyo, 23rd] The Chinese Communists on the 23rd accused the U.S. government of repeatedly sending "warships, aircraft, and troops" to Qingdao to assist the Nationalist forces, but this was directly denied by American naval officials here. At the same time, General MacArthur's spokesman also denied the Chinese Communist accusation that the United States was secretly training and equipping the Japanese army and navy.

[Associated Press Tokyo, 23rd] A spokesman for the U.S. Far East Fleet Command today denied the Chinese Communist radio's claim that 1,500 U.S. Marines had landed in Qingdao on the 14th of this month, calling it "routine propaganda."

[United Press Hong Kong, 22nd] Chinese Communist radio announced on the 22nd that the Chinese Communists do not recognize the U.S. announcement to cease seeking reparations from Japan as valid. Referring to the U.S. government's "illegal activities" in Qingdao and Japan, the Chinese Communist radio accused the U.S. of sending troops, warships, and aircraft to Qingdao, which it called an "act of aggression" against China.

Regarding the statement by Mr. McCoy, chairman of the Far Eastern Commission, to cancel the Japanese reparations plan, the Chinese Communist radio denounced such "barbaric behavior" as harming the interests of China and other countries entitled to reparations.

The radio also denounced MacArthur's headquarters for approving the expansion of the Japanese police force, stating, "MacArthur is covering up the secret training and equipping of the Japanese army and navy, and these actions threaten peace in the Far East."

### New Deployment in Guanzhong; Hu Zongnan Still Commanding in a Certain Location

[Central News Agency Nanzheng, 22nd] Amidst the tense situation in the Northwest, Xi'an, due to strategic considerations, has proactively evacuated various institutions and materials. On the 18th, a portion of the Communist bandits took the opportunity to break through our Jingwei River defense line, causing disturbances in Xianyang, Lintong, and other places. National forces are intercepting and engaging them on multiple routes, and the fighting is fierce. On the morning of the 20th, the National forces made a strategic retreat, concentrating in favorable areas to continue resisting. The urban area of Xi'an was captured by the bandits at 1:00 PM on the 20th. However, the National forces in the Guanzhong area have strong troop strength, and General Hu Zongnan is currently commanding operations in a certain location in Guanzhong, with new deployments already in place for the Guanzhong military.

### Jinghu-Hangzhou Headquarters Issues Letter to Army, Navy, and Air Force Officers and Soldiers

[Central News Agency, This City] The Political Warfare Department of the Jinghu-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters has recently issued a letter to the army, navy, and air force officers and soldiers in the Songhu area for the defense of Shanghai. The full text is as follows:

To all brave officers and soldiers,

The defense of the great city of Shanghai, which has attracted worldwide attention, has already begun. We are extremely excited and overjoyed. We are excited that we are the ones defending this anti-communist base of China, and we are overjoyed that we are the ones defending this democratic fortress of the world. This is the best opportunity for us to demonstrate our skills and serve the country. Our highest authorities have a firm will to defend Shanghai, and our commander-in-chief has an all-encompassing plan to defend Shanghai. For the sake of the independence and survival of our nation, and to avoid the tragedy of national subjugation, for the free way of life of our 450 million compatriots, and to avoid becoming cannon fodder in a third world war, and even more for the safety of our lives, families, wives, and children, and to avoid enslavement and dismemberment, we must fight these red traitorous Soviet dogs to the death!

Comrades! Our will is firm, unwavering, and unyielding. Our integrity is steadfast, unchanging, and non-surrendering. Our military virtue is upright, not greedy for wealth and not afraid of death. In the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, democracy and totalitarianism, freedom and unfreedom, we are not alone. We have the fervent sympathy of the peaceful and democratic countries of the world. We have the sincere support of the 6 million compatriots in Shanghai and the vast majority of peace-loving and democratic people in China. We also have millions of loyal and brave comrades in the army, navy, and air force who have experienced hundreds of battles. Under the wise leadership of Commander-in-Chief Tang, we must, and we certainly can, fight well, defend firmly, and hold tightly, making Shanghai a base for revitalizing the nation and rebuilding the country, thereby recovering Nanjing, restoring the Central Plains, liberating the Northeast, eliminating the bandits, and celebrating victory!

In these past few days of fierce fighting, we have fully demonstrated the glorious tradition of revolutionary soldiers, dealing a heavy blow to the arrogant and shameless bandits who have insulted our national army to the point of being utterly disgraced. We have made these red traitors taste the flavor of the national army's incomparably strong iron fist.

Comrades, let us work hard! Victory is based on struggle, glory comes from sacrifice, and success requires progress. We must all strive harder, uphold righteousness for the nation, fight for the dignity of the country, wash away the shame of the country, and avenge the blood of the martyrs!

### Qingbai Guard to Undergo Intensive Training Soon

[Central News Agency Qingdao, 23rd] Qingdao's 20,000-strong self-defense force will soon undergo intensive training. In addition to current military, police, military police, district heads, and students, employees of other public and private institutions, groups, factories, and citizens (excluding women) aged 18 to 35 will be specially selected and trained.

### Regarding the Case of the Murder of Qiu Dingkun's Entire Family, Sheng Shicai Analyzes the Inside Story, Believing It Was a Robbery-Homicide with No Other Reasons

[Central News Agency Taipei, 23rd] Mr. Sheng Shicai, the former governor of Xinjiang Province and currently a general advisor to the Ministry of National Defense, believes that the murder of his brother-in-law Qiu Dingkun's entire family of eleven, including servants, was a robbery-homicide case. Mr. Sheng told the Central News Agency reporter exclusively on the morning of the 23rd: Qiu Dingkun arrived in Xinjiang three years after Sheng Shicai came to Xinjiang from the Northeast. He served as an instructor and deputy director of the Xinjiang Military Academy and is currently a major general advisor to the Northwest Military and Political Office. He had no enemies in normal times. The "twenty years of grievances settled in one night" written on the wall, according to normal reasoning, the criminals would not have had time to write this while committing the crime. It must have been written by the criminals' accomplices afterward to create a mysterious atmosphere in an attempt to cover up their robbery-homicide act. At the same time, it was a pre-emptive measure so that if they were arrested in the future, they could use revenge as an excuse to reduce their sentences. According to Sheng Shicai's judgment, this case is definitely not a political conspiracy. Sheng Shicai believes that one of the main culprits in this case must be the runaway Deputy Officer Qi. The planning of this case must have been a long-term, organized robbery group, and at least one-third of its members must be acquaintances who often visited Qiu's residence. Therefore, during the commission of the crime, they were afraid of being recognized by the servants and killed them all together. Sheng Shicai judged that Deputy Officer Qi must still be hiding in Lanzhou City or the nearby suburbs after committing the crime and has not yet fled. The stolen goods must also still be hidden in Lanzhou, and the hiding place must have been carefully selected in advance. Sheng Shicai said: Deputy Officer Qi is also from the Northeast and has been following Qiu Zongjun for eight years. He appears loyal on the surface, but his relatives and friends think that Qi is very cunning and have suggested replacing him. Sheng Shicai judged that after Qiu Dingkun returned home from watching a movie, Deputy Officer Qi must have immediately let the murderers into the house. Qiu's residence had three self-defense pistols, which must have been taken away by the criminals after being designed by them. Regarding Sheng Shicai's letter to his father-in-law Qiu Zongjun, according to Sheng Shicai, this letter was sent on May 5th. Because Taiyuan had already fallen, Sheng Shicai was deeply afraid that Qiu Zongjun and others would be trapped inside the Communist bandits' iron curtain in the future, and their lives and property would be difficult to protect. Therefore, he advised Qiu Zongjun to quickly fly to Taiwan or Guangzhou and Hong Kong to live. As for the phrase "must keep secret, do not love property, do not take cars" in the letter, it was because he was afraid of being ambushed by bandits on the way. Sheng Shicai also said: The US$40,000 that Qiu Dingkun deposited in a New York bank was remitted from Chongqing to the United States during the Anti-Japanese War. At that time, Qiu Dingkun's wife had kidney stones and planned to fly to the United States for surgery. Later, his wife had surgery in Lanzhou instead and did not go to the United States. The money has been stored until now. Sheng Shicai received a telegram from the Lanzhou Northeast Association on the 22nd regarding the report of this case. He immediately planned to telegraph Ma Bufang, commander of the Northwest Military and Political Office, and Guo Jiqiao, chairman of Gansu Province, to arrest the criminals and solve the case as soon as possible. Sheng Shicai arrived in Taiwan in January of this year and currently resides in Taipei with the fourteen guards who came with him from Xinjiang.

### Badger Arrives in Hong Kong to Discuss Evacuation of U.S. Nationals from South China

[United Press Hong Kong, 23rd] Vice Admiral Badger, commander of the U.S. Navy in the Western Pacific, arrived here aboard the flagship Eldorado on the morning of the 23rd. He will discuss the evacuation of U.S. nationals from South China with officials from the U.S. Embassy.

[Associated Press Hong Kong, 23rd] The commander of the U.S. Western Pacific Fleet, Badger, arrived here today and immediately went to Guangzhou to convene U.S. consuls stationed in Hong Kong and Guangzhou to discuss the plan for evacuating U.S. nationals from South China. According to Mr. Hoppe, the U.S. Consul General in Hong Kong: The evacuation of U.S. nationals from Hong Kong may also be discussed. There are currently four to five hundred U.S. nationals scattered throughout South China. More than a dozen U.S. women and children from Kunming have recently evacuated here. Most of the U.S. nationals in Sichuan, Yunnan, and other places have accepted the advice of the U.S. consuls and gathered in Guangzhou to await evacuation, but some still remain in the interior.

### Hong Kong Government Formulates Plan to Prepare for Preventing Unrest

[Reuters Hong Kong, 23rd] A spokesman for the Hong Kong government's defense department said that the authorities have formulated a plan to deploy troops to support the police in the event of internal unrest in Hong Kong and the Kowloon leased territories. He declined to say whether there is currently an internal threat in the Hong Kong and Kowloon areas or to compare the situation in Hong Kong and Kowloon with Malaysia, but said that although the authorities do not want to use troops to patrol the Kowloon border, the army is ready at any time so that it can be dispatched to assist the police in a short period of time upon notification. He also said that the issue of building a new airport in Kowloon is still under consideration. Currently, the air force in Hong Kong has a squadron of Spitfire fighter planes, a squadron of Sunderland flying boat reconnaissance planes, and a squadron of Auster air observation planes. Some of these planes are suitable for assisting the police and army in reconnaissance in the event of internal unrest.

### Central Government Decides to Reform Currency System; Stored Xiamen Gold and Silver Coins to Be Used as Foundation; Huang Xuchu Returns to Guangxi After Attending Finance and Food Meeting to Discuss

[Central News Agency Guilin, 23rd] Guangxi Chairman Huang Xuchu flew back to Guilin from Guangzhou yesterday. When reporters visited him and asked about his impressions of the trip, Huang first explained the proceedings of the food and finance meeting and said: Currency reform is imperative, and the central government has decided to use the stored gold and silver coins in Xiamen as the foundation for currency reform, which is expected to be implemented in the short term. He continued: The central government is determined to stop the war with war and suppress the rebellion to the end. The Chinese Communists have no sincerity in seeking peace, which has led to the expansion of the war. They should be held responsible for the war. The entire people must rise up to fight, etc.

### Fujian Issues Silver Dollar Subsidiary Coin Notes; Market Gradually Stabilizing

[Central News Agency Fuzhou, 23rd] Due to the recent slight easing of the situation in Fujian and the circulation of silver dollars, silver coins, and copper coins, the market here is gradually stabilizing, but transactions have not yet returned to normal. The Fujian Provincial Bank began issuing silver dollar subsidiary coin notes on the 23rd, with denominations of 1 fen, 5 fen, 1 jiao, 2 jiao, and 5 jiao. The central bank allocated silver dollars and provincial government materials as reserves for full redemption. The difficulties encountered in small-sum transactions in the market in recent weeks have been resolved, and social and economic activities have become more flexible. However, commodity prices in the market are still not uniform. In addition to those priced in silver dollars, many are still calculated in gold and white rice. The rice market is short of rice due to the loss of northern Fujian and the lack of food sources. The black market price of rice is above two qian of gold. The ratio of gold to silver dollars has been set by the authorities at five silver dollars for one qian of gold. The salaries of provincial government employees are also paid in silver dollars.

### The Truth About Peace in Beiping (Continued from Yesterday)

Secondly, let's talk about the general public education personnel. As early as the beginning of the siege, leaflets from Lin Biao, the commander of the front line, were discovered in the city, outlining eight articles of agreement. Articles four and five concerned public education personnel. Article four stated that after the People's Liberation Army (PLA) entered the city, all school faculty, cultural and educational institutions, health organizations, and other social welfare institution staff would continue to serve, and the PLA would protect them from violation. Article five stated that all officials at the provincial, municipal, and county levels, as well as baojia personnel, who had no reactionary behavior and possessed special skills would be selectively employed. At that time, many public education personnel, who had been oppressed by life for many years, saw some wealthy officials and rich people fleeing south with gold, and while envious and sighing, they suddenly saw this leaflet. Many said that we rely on our mental efforts to eat, and fortunately, we are all Chinese. There is no question of being a traitor. Since people protect and employ us, whoever comes, we will work for them. As the hope for peace intensified, it was rumored that after the Communist Party entered the city, the administrative organs would only replace one head, and the rest would remain unchanged. Even the heads of academic or technical organs would not be replaced, and the treatment would all be paid in kind. Regardless of rank, the quantity would be determined by the number of family members. At that time, the general public education personnel secretly wished for the PLA to come quickly, and some so-called stubborn elements even worried about losing their integrity.

Although time passed slowly, the PLA finally entered the city. The first administrative organ to be taken over was the Hebei Provincial Government, and the military organ was initially the Garrison Command. The method of takeover was to take all the property and furniture, and all the officials, high and low, were swept out the door, even the workers were not left. It is well known that the Hebei Provincial Government, from Chairman Chu Xichun down, was honest and hardworking and employed people with integrity. However, the receivers all looked at people through the lens of "all officials are corrupt." Therefore, they were picky and made things difficult during the takeover. After finally clearing the handover, it was said that on February 24, they received another notice stating that the Hebei Provincial Government should hand over to the North China People's Government, and new rosters should be created, with an attached explanation that after the rosters were created, each supervisor must personally explain and report orally. At that time, officials at all levels had already dispersed, and no one created the rosters. Secretary-General Tao and the heads of the various departments reported the truth, but the answer they received was, "Can't you write yourselves? Why must you rely on others?" Helpless, this group of lonely ministers and remnants had to put on their reading glasses and create the rosters themselves. As for what happened when the North China People's Government took over, there was no way to know. Now, Chairman Chu is living in seclusion at home. When he moved to Beiping, he was acting as the Pan Yang city defense commander and filled out his household registration accordingly. Even after becoming chairman, he did not change it. Therefore, the South Chang Street chief and the public security bureau agents have repeatedly talked to him, asking him to go to training with other scattered military officers. Although he has repeatedly asked Jiao Shiqi to intercede, they still often trouble him. Also, his house at No. 74 South Chang Street was bought from Hu Bohan when he arrived in Beiping. Now the Communist Party also wants to take it over. After asking someone to intercede, he was only allowed to live there temporarily. All the officials of the provincial government have lost their jobs. It is said that Yao, the secretary-general, is planning to earn a living by selling silver ("buy two, sell two," which is the cry of silver traders in Beiping) after the handover is completed. Lower-level officials are not worth asking about.

Following the provincial government was the municipal government. On the day of the takeover, Ye Jianying said: They have no experience in urban work and must learn everything from the old people, but they must learn revolutionary theory from them. Therefore, section chiefs and below can only be temporarily retained. However, in addition to the eight-hour office hours each day, they must also study revolution for two hours, read the People's Daily, Marxism-Leninism, and New Democracy, and listen to the lectures of those old cadres who cannot read half a bushel of large characters. How they will be arranged in the future is still unknown.

As for the academic and technical institutions, they were indeed left untouched, but each unit was assigned three liaison officers from the Military Control Commission, which is equivalent to the liaison officers during the Japanese occupation, that is, the supreme emperors of this institution. Everything, big and small, must be reported to them for instructions, even buying a few sheets of ten-line paper must be approved by them. The liaison officers in the Japanese era were all experts in their fields and were admirable, but these liaison officers were all standard party members who had received strict training from the Communist Party since they were five or six years old. They are all around twenty years old. When it comes to Marxism-Leninism, they only have a smattering of knowledge, but they know nothing about the business of the institutions they are in charge of. The suffering of those experts under the rule of this group of children is imaginable. But that's not all. The most painful thing is learning revolution. Imagine this group of experts, every day like the aforementioned civil servants, being asked to read the superficial and incomprehensible People's Daily and New Democracy. The pain is even more unimaginable. As for the living conditions, the hospital directors, presidents of specialized schools, or chairmen of the school affairs maintenance committees receive 400 to 450 catties of millet, university professors and high school principals receive 300 to 400 catties of millet, middle school teachers or elementary school principals receive 200 to 300 catties of millet, elementary school teachers receive about 200 catties of millet, and the other retained civil servants receive their salaries in similar proportions. Now Beiping is a millet world. Since the public education personnel are all paid in millet, millet is naturally cheap, and other prices are very high. The exchange rate between millet and white flour is said to be three to one. Also, the earnings of an average public education worker are only enough for one person to eat. To support a family, one must come up with another idea.

When it comes to the spirit or emotions, it is even more unspeakable. At the beginning of the victory, governments at all levels also retained personnel from the puppet organizations. Now, those who are retained are even more distressed than they were. Those who were retained in the puppet organizations were just listening to a few more harsh words of "traitor." Now, in addition to often hearing the no longer harsh words "puppet," "reactionary," "counter-revolutionary," and "Chiang bandit," the most distressing thing is the liaison officers' visits. From the age of six or seven to the present, their actions every year are questioned in detail. One person asks, and then another asks. Those who have not experienced it cannot know this kind of bitterness. If it is discovered that you have been involved with so-called reactionary political parties, there will be even more trouble. Now everyone is uneasy and cannot live in peace.

As for the county-level civil servants, most of them had arrived in Beiping when the counties were abandoned. The central task of these people was to suppress the rebellion. How could they not directly or indirectly offend some Communists? Now that Beiping has become a Communist world, it is truly a case of "those with grievances will be avenged, and those with grudges will be repaid." Communists from various counties have come to Beiping to find them and send them back to their counties to be purged. The threat they face is even greater than those originally in Beiping. Now many are terrified all day long and do not know what to do. As for the baojia personnel, although they have repeatedly expressed their loyalty, after the district chief is replaced, they begin to hold district people's congresses for purging. Even if the purge is flawless, they are forced to read a pre-printed letter of repentance in public. The main points are that they should not have helped the reactionary government to do things, should not have helped the reactionary government to conscript soldiers and laborers, and should not have been corrupt. Those who are honest and self-disciplined also have to read it while swallowing their grievances. As for how they will be dealt with after repenting and being dismissed, it is still unknown. Now the baojia system in Beiping has been abolished and replaced by the street neighborhood system. Each street has a street chief, who is filled by a Communist Party cadre. There are street chiefs in the northern and southern parts of Xiaonanhai. Below the street is the neighborhood, and the neighborhood chief is appointed by the street chief, who considers them to be loyal and reliable. (To be continued)

### Shanghai Stands Firm; Whether It Can Be Defended for Long Depends on the Government's Determination

[Central News Agency Guangzhou, 23rd] The defense of Shanghai is currently underway fiercely. This is a matter of international concern. Whether Shanghai, a large city with 6 million citizens, can be defended for long depends entirely on the central government. It is reported that the Communist army originally planned to capture Shanghai on the 17th of this month. However, due to the resistance of our heroic defenders, they have not succeeded. The Chinese Communists then broadcast that in order to facilitate the withdrawal of the National army, they would occupy Shanghai on the 19th. Who knew that the Communist army's plan failed, and Shanghai still stood firm. It has recently been heard that the Chinese Communists are broadcasting again, saying that in consideration of the lives and property of the 6 million citizens of Shanghai, they have decided to postpone the offensive and temporarily delay the occupation of Shanghai, etc. This shows that the National army is capable of fighting and defending well and can truly ensure the safety of Shanghai. The consistent propaganda tactics used by the Chinese Communists have been shattered by the strong resistance of our heroic National army. According to Mr. Wang Xiaolai, who has just arrived in Guangzhou from Shanghai, the National army can definitely defend Shanghai, without a doubt. The 6 million citizens of Shanghai can unite with the same hatred and work closely with the National army. This is why the defense of Shanghai can be successful. The people of Shanghai fear that once the Communist army controls Shanghai, their lives and property will not be guaranteed, and their personal freedom will also be deprived. Therefore, the citizens of Shanghai all oppose the Communist Party. However, as the war becomes more and more intense, the consumption is increasing day by day, and it is difficult to continue. Whether the Shanghai National army can defend for a long time depends on the government's determination.

### Editorial: From Silver Dollars to Prices

——Establish a Public Silver Dollar Market As Soon As Possible

The exchange rate for silver dollars was initially set by the Central Bank at 9.6 million (in the local currency). It was then adjusted to 13.2 million on the 21st of this month, and again to 36 million starting yesterday. This kind of dynamic adjustment is a commendable response to natural economic trends. Given the substantial amount of Gold Yuan being issued, especially to cover military and government expenses, the market is effectively flooded with these new notes, which inevitably drives up prices. Therefore, the current surge in prices is not caused by the prices themselves, but rather a passive consequence of the monetary policy. This is something that should be clearly understood.

In essence, silver dollars are a financial commodity, and their fluctuations are naturally linked to the overall price level. Especially in the current environment, silver dollars are not only a common commodity but also function as currency due to their intrinsic value, smaller denominations, and flexible use. People hold silver dollars to preserve value and purchase daily necessities. In fact, they are happy to collect them. Consequently, silver dollar transactions are particularly active whenever government employees or other salaried workers receive their pay. This trend underscores the correctness of the aforementioned theory. However, on the other hand, the price of silver dollars is not controlled by the Central Bank, which holds a large quantity of silver, but rather determined by speculators, which is somewhat perplexing.

Recently, the Central Bank has also recognized that the price of silver dollars is being manipulated by speculators, and that silver dollar transactions are scattered throughout the streets, which negatively impacts normal economic development. Therefore, it decided some time ago to establish a public silver dollar market. However, this plan has not yet been implemented, making one question the effectiveness of our Central Bank. In the modern world, central banks in various countries generally stabilize markets through open market operations. Although our current situation is quite dire, it is still necessary for the Central Bank to implement an open market policy.

The purpose of establishing a silver dollar market is to allow the Central Bank to control the market through this channel in the future. Furthermore, the listing of silver dollars should enable dynamic measures to be taken daily, moving prices toward a more reasonable level. As for the type of silver dollars, we believe that different prices may be initially set when they are first listed. However, with the exception of "boat dollars" (ship-image coins), all other silver dollars should be gradually withdrawn and sent to the Central Mint to be recast into new coins. This would eliminate the various kinds of foreign silver coins from the market. All of the "big head," "eagle," "dragon," "Hong Kong," and miscellaneous silver dollars would become nothing more than historical names. Matters of state should ideally be handled "with virtue and persuasion," especially in economic affairs. Moreover, today's holders of silver dollars are largely government employees and salaried workers who have saved their money. Ignoring this fact and rigidly fixing the price of silver dollars would be tantamount to depriving them of their hard-earned income. How could the authorities possibly do this?

In conclusion, it is necessary for the Central Bank to establish a public silver dollar market, whether from a legal, humanistic, or economic standpoint. Only when the Central Bank establishes a public silver dollar market will the price of silver dollars be brought back to normalcy, and the chaos in social prices will be alleviated.

### Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers Reunited at the Palais Rose Marble in Paris Thousands of People Scramble to Witness the Grand Meeting

[Special Dispatch] Paris, 23rd: The Foreign Ministers of Great Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union convened at the Palais Rose Marble in Paris at 2:55 PM (Universal Time) on the 23rd to initiate the historic Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference. Thousands of people gathered outside the gates of the Palais Rose Marble. Approximately fifty journalists and photographers stood outside the gates, eagerly awaiting the arrival of the four foreign ministers. The four foreign ministers arrived directly at the palace gates in police-escorted vehicles, followed by advisors and experts. Acheson was the first to arrive at the venue. After stepping out of his car, he entered the palace with Jessup. The Bevans arrived four minutes later in a British Embassy car, followed by Vyshinsky's car, which bore the Soviet flag. French Foreign Minister Schuman had been waiting in the palace before the other three foreign ministers arrived. Journalists busily took photographs before leaving the venue, marking the commencement of the first session of the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference.

[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] The Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference is being held in the luxurious Palais Rose Marble in western Paris. The British, American, and French Foreign Ministers held a 90-minute meeting at the French Foreign Ministry yesterday. Afterwards, State Department Press Officer McDermott stated that the three foreign ministers had discussed the German issue for quite some time and should know how to handle it. After attending the meeting, Acheson walked back to the American Embassy instead of taking a car. He then had lunch with Ambassador-at-Large Jessup and Republican foreign policy advisor Dulles. Among the four foreign ministers attending this conference, only Bevin has participated in previous Foreign Ministers Conferences. Acheson and Schuman are attending for the first time, and Vyshinsky is also attending as the chief delegate for the first time. The general issues facing the foreign ministers at the opening of this conference can be summarized as follows: (1) Europe is already divided. Can the Soviet Union and the Western countries agree on a solution to the German issue? (2) If the four powers agree to the division of Germany, trade between East and West will be permanently broken, which will encourage mutual suspicion. (3) If they agree on the unification of Germany, the political struggle for the future status of Germany will intensify. (4) The four powers may also agree to establish a Germany that is politically divided but economically unified, but the conditions are still subject to negotiation. The Soviet Union favors a centralized German government controlled by the Communist Party, with a government selected by popular vote based on a single list of candidates. The Western countries advocate for the establishment of a Federal Republic of Germany, with a federal government selected from various political parties through free and secret general elections. The main problem at this Foreign Ministers Conference is how to eliminate the ideological differences between these Eastern and Western powers.

[United Press, Paris, 22nd] After Acheson arrived here yesterday, the three foreign ministers immediately convened to review the 32-page report prepared by the Deputy Foreign Ministers, which was completed and approved today. It is reported that the Western foreign ministers approved the Deputy Foreign Ministers' report with the following two points: (1) Oppose any suggestion from the Soviet side to end the military occupation of Germany early. (2) Agree in principle that Germany should be unified, but insist that it should not be unified under conditions that would make Germany a Soviet vassal. The last preliminary meeting of the Western foreign ministers began at 10:30 AM and ended at 11:50 AM. Those who accompanied Acheson to the meeting included Dulles, Jessup, and State Department Counselor Bohlen. The three foreign ministers appeared quite pleased at the time. Bevin criticized Dulles' remarks, saying, "There will also be a gathering this afternoon, as the French and British football teams will face off." Bevin then went to the venue to watch the game, while Acheson and Dulles took their wives to visit Versailles. Acheson then convened his advisors at the American Embassy in the afternoon to discuss matters.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd] The Foreign Ministers of Great Britain, the United States, and France held their final meeting this morning at the French Foreign Ministry. They approved the preliminary talk reports submitted by the representatives of the three countries and experts on German issues, and agreed on a method of announcing the progress of the Four Power Conference. They prepared to suggest to the Soviet Foreign Minister to use the methods used in the past, namely that after each meeting, the spokespersons of each delegation would hold a press conference to announce the proceedings of that meeting.

### Bonn Constitution Officially Announced and Implemented West Germany Republic Born Elections for Government and Parliament to Be Held Within Three Months

[Special Dispatch] London, 23rd: Bonn News: The German Constitutional Assembly announced the implementation of the new constitution on the 23rd, officially marking the birth of the Federal Republic of West Germany. The West German Federation will include the states within the American, British, and French occupation zones, but the door remains open for the states in the Soviet occupation zone to join. However, it is expected that as long as the Soviet occupation continues, East Germany will remain outside. The seventy politicians who drafted the constitution will announce the dissolution of the assembly. Elections for the new republic's government and parliament will be held within the next three months. Berlin is not included in the new federation, but it may send representatives to attend parliamentary sessions as observers. Eighty-eight non-Communists signed the new constitution in a simple and solemn ceremony.

[Agence France-Presse, Frankfurt, 22nd] The Bonn Constitutional Assembly will hold its final meeting on Monday to officially announce the constitution, stipulating the establishment of the Federal Republic of West Germany. The chairmen of the local councils and the leaders of the three Western allies will attend. German political figures attach great importance to this move. They emphasize that the West German constitution has been unanimously approved by the states of West Germany except Bavaria, and is supported by all West German political parties except the Christian Social Union in Bavaria and the Communist Party. This demonstrates the unity of West Germany.

### Relations Between the United States and the Soviet Union May Improve Clay Gives Radio Address in the United States

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 22nd] General Clay, former commander of the American forces in Germany, declared in a radio address here today that relations between the United States and the Soviet Union may improve, but believes that Soviet leaders are not currently prepared to abandon their desire to "dominate the world." Clay continued, "As for the Cold War, we can reach an agreement and improve the situation. But we should not forget that the real goal of communism is to dominate the world, and this goal will never be abandoned."

### British Newspaper Publishes Commentary Indicating Soviet Policy Remains Unchanged

[British Information Service, London, 23rd] Regarding the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference to be held in Paris on May 23rd, "Time and Tide" commented: Regardless of the Soviet leaders' true motive for requesting the convening of the Foreign Ministers Conference, it would be a grave error if we were to believe that they have decided to make significant changes in their foreign policy. We must assume that their fundamental policies remain unchanged, and that they will continue to strive to achieve the following objectives: to prevent West Germany from forming a political and economic life based on Western principles, and to prevent the Western countries from achieving solid security through the North Atlantic Treaty. "Time and Tide" concluded: The Western countries must not deviate from the path they have taken, and should reach an agreement with the Soviet Union without sacrificing important principles. "The Economist" also emphasized the difficulties and dangers in this Foreign Ministers Conference, and stated that the Western countries should first make a clear statement on their policy towards Germany. The newspaper pointed out that the only wise approach is to announce at the opening of the Foreign Ministers Conference that the Western countries desire a unified Germany, the withdrawal of occupying forces, and the submission of appropriate conditions. The newspaper continued that in addition to guaranteeing the protection of Germany's political freedom, the Western countries should also reaffirm the suggestion previously made by Byrnes to conclude a fifty-year treaty between the four powers, in order to maintain the demilitarization of Germany and prevent the resurgence of German military power. If the Soviet Union is truly as peace-loving as they claim, then this suggestion should be able to become the first step in a policy of reconciliation between the Western countries and the Soviet Union.

### De Gaulle Speech Attacks Bonn Constitution Believes It Is the Restoration of Germany

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd] General de Gaulle, speaking at the adjournment of the French People's Rally today, emphasized that France should restore sufficient strength to balance the power of Germany. De Gaulle attacked the West German constitution in Bonn, believing this is the restoration of Germany, and said that the Atlantic Treaty should not be approved before supplementary measures are taken. De Gaulle hopes that France and Germany can reach an understanding, but said that this understanding requires certain conditions. And the main condition is that France should become strong again with the help of French North Africa, in order to balance the power of the new Germany and make economic understanding between the two countries possible. De Gaulle emphasized that France should restore its economic and financial strength within its resource capabilities. At the adjournment of the conference, it was announced that the party's foreign policy, defense policy, and policy toward French alliances are different from those of the French government, and attacked the government for its repeated failures in financial, economic, and social aspects.

### Burmese Army Recovers Insein

[Reuters, Rangoon, 22nd] The city of Insein, which had been occupied by the Karen forces for sixteen weeks, was recovered by government forces today. The city is ten miles north of Rangoon. When the Burmese government forces entered, the Karen forces had completely withdrawn north, and the Karen President Ba Yi Ji, who was originally in the city, had also escaped. When the Karen forces withdrew, the residents of the city immediately raised white flags. The city originally had 20,000 residents, and 10,000 of them had evacuated to Rangoon during the temporary truce. The Insein Central Prison, known as the third largest prison in the world, is intact and undamaged, with about 500 prisoners still inside. The government's announcement also announced that government forces were simultaneously advancing towards Taikkyi, another Karen stronghold seventy miles north of Rangoon.

### U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Creates a Laughingstock Senators Demand His Immediate Resignation

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] Republican Senator Hickenlooper today demanded that Mr. Lilienthal resign from his position as chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, believing that this committee is the cause of many jokes. Two recent examples are the missing uranium-235 and the awarding of bonuses to some people who should not have access to the committee's secrets. Hickenlooper previously served as chairman of the Congressional Atomic Energy Committee.

### New Cabinet of Colombia Personnel Determined Former Police Chief Appointed Prime Minister

[Reuters, Bogota, 22nd] The new Conservative military cabinet took over the government today. The resignations of the six Liberal Party cabinet members in the coalition cabinet ended the National Union government that had been formed since the revolution of April 1948. The new cabinet has been appointed by President Perez, with former Police Chief Zambrano as Prime Minister and the former Minister of War, Angulo, as Minister of Foreign Affairs.

### Number of Japanese POWs in the Soviet Union Should Be Over 300,000 MacArthur's Advisor Doubts Soviet Reported Figures

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 23rd] Civil Adviser Sebald, Allied Supreme Commander MacArthur's political advisor, stated that according to careful estimates, the number of Japanese prisoners of war still in Soviet hands "should" be over 300,000. Sebald made this statement in response to an official statement reported by Moscow's TASS News Agency from the Soviet War Prisoners Repatriation Administration, which claimed that all Japanese war prisoners remaining in the Soviet Union would be repatriated to their home country within the months of May and November this year. TASS News Agency released a total of only 97,000 of these prisoners of war. Sebald pointed out that the number of 95,000 is the first estimate released by the Soviet government since World War II. Before departing from Tokyo on May 3rd to report to duty here, he personally protested to the Soviet representative on behalf of MacArthur, arguing that the Soviet Union did not provide sufficient information regarding the number of Japanese prisoners of war. In April of this year, Sebald wrote to the Soviet representative, requesting the publication of reports on the deaths, disappearances, and serious illnesses of Japanese war prisoners. The Soviet Union has never provided such reports to the Allied Headquarters, but Sebald pointed out that such reports are extremely important to the Japanese people, especially to the families of the individuals involved. There were no reports on the prisoners of war acquired by the Soviet Union, not only in the East, but also in the West. The United States has twice requested the Soviet Union to report on the situation of German prisoners of war this year. The number of German prisoners of war is estimated to be around 500,000, and their fate remains shrouded in secrecy. Since November of last year, the Soviet Union has not repatriated Japanese prisoners of war. The suspension of the repatriation work at that time was said to be due to climate and ice conditions. Although the Allied Headquarters has repeatedly expressed its willingness to assist in overcoming these difficulties, it has still been ineffective. The list of the last repatriation in November of last year also shows that the Soviet Union had not fulfilled the agreement between the Allied Headquarters and the Soviet Union to repatriate 50,000 prisoners of war per month for 18 consecutive months.

### U.S. House Appropriations Committee Decides to Cut Foreign Aid Funds Total Reduction Reaches Over $770 Million

### Forrestal's Death Shocks the World British and American Leaders Express Condolences All U.S. Military Facilities Fly Flags at Half-Mast

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] President Truman issued a written statement today regarding the death of former Secretary of Defense Forrestal, expressing his unspeakable shock and grief upon learning of the death of his friend Forrestal. The death of this capable and loyal public servant is no less than the death of a soldier on the front lines. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, in Paris, said that all those who were close to Forrestal, including himself, were worried about Forrestal's illness. We deeply know the weight of the responsibilities he bore during the difficult years of war and after the war. I originally hoped that rest could restore his health, but unfortunately it did not go as expected, which makes the whole country feel regret. British Defense Minister Alexander, in London, also said that Forrestal was a great servant of the United States and its fighting forces, as well as the entire democratic system.

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] The new Secretary of Defense Johnson, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Eisenhower, and former President Hoover all sent condolences.

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] President Truman and all officials in Washington were shocked on the 22nd by the news of former Secretary of Defense Forrestal's suicide. All military facilities and naval vessels in the United States today flew flags at half-mast.

### Forrestal Attempted Suicide Three Times Before Jumping From Building American Radio Commentator Reveals

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Radio commentator Pearson was one of the first to publicly disclose that former Secretary of Defense Forrestal was seriously ill. In his regular broadcast on the evening of the 21st, he said that only two weeks ago, the fourth suicide attempt was prevented by employees of the Bethesda Naval Hospital. He did not specify how Forrestal attempted suicide, only saying that Forrestal had attempted suicide by hanging, cutting his veins, and taking sleeping pills in Florida. Forrestal was transferred to Bethesda because of these three suicide attempts.

### U.S. Navy to Conduct Thorough Investigation

[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] After former Secretary of Defense Forrestal committed suicide by jumping from a building at the Navy Hospital today, a volume of ancient Greek poetry was found in his bedroom. On one of the opened pages, the poem said: "When the days of reason are without light and joy, it is better to die and sleep forever." Forrestal jumped from a sixteenth-floor window, falling to his death on a third-floor balcony, with a bathrobe belt tied around his neck. The Navy Department immediately organized an investigative committee to thoroughly investigate the reasons and why no one was guarding the room at the time. Forrestal had been suffering from overwork and had been in the hospital for seven weeks, but he ended up in this situation.

### Former British Representative to Allied Control Council Condemns U.S. Assistance to Japan Will Allow Japan to Threaten the World Again

[United Press, New York, 22nd] "Japan—Enemy or Ally?", a book written by former British Commonwealth representative to the Allied Control Council for Japan in Tokyo, Bower, has recently been published. The book expresses that the United States may allow Japan to become a threat again. Bower said that fear of the Soviet Union has caused the United States to view Japan as a "highly hopeful ally" rather than a "hated enemy." During the three and a half years of occupation, there have been no fundamental changes in Japan's social institutions or the political situation of its neighbors. Bower also said, "It may be true that if the United States maintains its current strategic interests in the Far East for a long time, the United States will easily suppress any signs of Japan's future re-aggression, or the United States' maintenance of its military and political control in this area will continue to consume a large amount of American resources. And the commercial compensation is insignificant, so we cannot determine whether the United States will be prepared to maintain these obligations indefinitely. The economic assistance that Japan currently receives from the United States is more likely to cause international disputes. Isn't restoring Japan as the workshop of East Asia helping Japan to re-establish its economic imperialism? During the war, we shed a lot of sweat and blood and spent a lot of materials to destroy Japan's economic imperialism."

### Japanese Parliament Adjourns

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] The Japanese Parliament will temporarily adjourn as planned from the 23rd. Most of the important bills will be passed by this parliament.

According to indications, a huge commercial agreement may be in progress. Castelli arrived here ten days ago, had a secret two-hour talk with Tito on the 21st, and took a car back to Milan on the morning of the 23rd.

### Serious Situation of Railway Workers' Strike in Berlin: US, British, and French Commanders Meet to Discuss Countermeasures Against Soviet Conflicts with Workers

[United Press, Berlin, 23rd] On the third day of the Berlin railway workers' strike, the situation remains serious. US military commander Howley has convened a meeting of British and French military commanders this morning to discuss countermeasures. According to Howley, "This embarrassing situation requires our attention. This is no longer a dispute between the Soviet-managed railway bureau and the workers. The bureau has used armed personnel and police to suppress the strike and threatened workers with permanent dismissal." Currently, railway services in all Berlin occupation zones have mostly returned to normal, with only the elevated railway yet to resume operation.

[United Press, Berlin, 22nd] Communist anti-strikers and armed police departing from the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin clashed with German striking workers on the elevated railway today, fighting over the main lines of the elevated railway in Berlin, resulting in bloodshed. German police under Soviet control opened fire during the melee, killing one person and injuring eighteen. This is the second day of riots caused by the strike. Police estimate that the total number of injured has reached one thousand. Today, in addition to minor skirmishes, at least nine bloody battles occurred, with both sides accusing each other of attempting to start a civil war on the eve of the Four Powers Foreign Ministers' meeting in Paris tomorrow. At the Charlottenburg station in the British sector of Berlin, control changed hands four times during the day. British armed police later occupied the station, with orders to shoot to kill if the Communists fired again. A leader of the independent UGO railway union, to which the strikers belong, threatened to launch a general strike unless an agreement is reached. However, late on the 22nd, the strike leaders decided against this, only reiterating the demand that all German police controlled by the Soviet Union leave the three western districts of Berlin. According to international agreements, the elevated railway of Berlin, including those in the western districts, is under Soviet control. The German railway workers launched the strike at midnight on the 20th, demanding payment in marks issued by the Western Allies, rather than the less valuable marks issued by the Soviet Union. Fighting broke out immediately after the strike was launched, and has gradually intensified over the past forty-eight hours.

### French President Auriol Encourages National Effort

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd] French President Auriol stated today that France is progressing on the road to recovery. However, he said that the Marshall Plan will end in 1952, so the French people must not relax. The President said, "We are very close to our goal, but we must not allow the passions of political parties or unreasonable fantasies to destroy everything. We must set aside political ideas, forget political disputes and differences, and work together under the premise of the Republic and the premise of political, economic, and social stability."

### South Irish Government Opposes Irish Bill

[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] The Irish Foreign Ministry today opposed the British government's recent passage of the Irish Bill, protesting that Britain will guarantee the continued division of Ireland. The South Irish Government Information Bureau issued a lengthy statement, stating that the unilateral and ineffective arrangements made by the British government in the Irish Bill are not in line with the policy of mutual friendship and cooperation between Britain and Ireland. The British government did not notify the Irish Foreign Ministry or consult with Ireland before discussing the Irish Bill in the House of Commons.

### American Experts on Aid to Backward Countries Plan Propose Steps Must Be Taken: Creating a Favorable Environment is Essential for Economic Development

Regarding the global technical and financial assistance cooperation program proposed in President Truman's inaugural address, one of the four points in the plan, preparatory work has revealed how underdeveloped countries must establish their higher living standards and how other countries can assist them. One of the latest developments is that Mr. Morse, Chairman of the Governing Body of the International Labor Organization, announced here that the International Labor Organization has established technical training centers in four major locations around the world. Meanwhile, spokespersons representing various institutions such as the World Bank, the United Nations Economic and Employment Commission, and the US State Department and Department of Agriculture, stated that the following steps must be taken. Countries that require economic development must obtain most of the necessary funds from their own people, and the rest should be used to attract private investment from other places. To succeed, each country must create a favorable "environment," ensuring that investors have reasonable guarantees to prevent financial losses and obtain reasonable profits. In most underdeveloped countries, agricultural development must be prioritized, and this requires modern transportation, electricity, and irrigation. Industrial development must be second. The overall plan is as follows: More food, improved sanitation, and disease prevention programs will produce healthier people, which in turn can produce stronger workers. Technical training must cultivate sufficient technical and management personnel capable of using modern methods. Stable government and stable currency, and guarantees to investors, will attract more investment for development projects. Before any development plan begins, thorough scientific research must be conducted to first determine whether the country has sufficient natural resources and can guarantee sufficient production, and that the products produced can be sold in the world's dollar area to repay the necessary imports of modern equipment, while still keeping the country in a good balance of payments position. After underdeveloped countries take these steps and meet these conditions, they will be able to move steadily towards a better standard of living, increasingly comparable to more fortunate countries. Experts agree on this point. Mr. Ma Fuli of the International Chamber of Commerce stated at Success Lake on Thursday, telling the United Nations Economic and Employment Commission that the economic development of underdeveloped regions depends on creating a "more favorable climate for investment." American representative Lu Ping told the committee that the reason why American capital cannot reach urgently needed areas is not the desire for huge profits, but fear. Fear arises from political and monetary instability, the inability to convert profits into other currencies, complicated taxes, and the risk of investment. The United States is now preparing to negotiate treaties with other countries to eliminate the reasons for fear. In a memorandum to the committee, the World Bank stated: "The Bank's lending is limited to sound and productive projects, and this decision will not waver." But it pointed out: "The development of underdeveloped countries depends on the continuous inflow of capital, and this capital should be invested in a series of orderly plans." The Bank's continued investment at a fixed investment rate can help countries avoid sudden changes in business conditions. According to the Bank's experience, "the best way to achieve higher real income is to invest in agriculture." This goal often needs to be supplemented by investment in light or heavy industry to achieve. However, for extreme industrialization that emphasizes industry while ignoring heavy industry, underdeveloped countries may only have the appearance of development without the substance." US Secretary of Agriculture Brannan recently stated in a speech: "Two-thirds of the world's population depends on agriculture for a living, and the percentage is higher in underdeveloped countries. Despite these efforts to produce food, the vast majority of the world's people are still unable to eat enough." Brannan reported to President Truman's Economic Development Committee on the prospects for the implementation of the World Technical Assistance Program. It is said: "This program is not something that can be done overnight. Even if we jointly use the resources of various countries through the Food and Agriculture Organization and other United Nations agencies, this will not be achieved overnight. One of the reasons is the lack of sufficient trained personnel to do this work. Furthermore, we have found that the real work must be completed by the local people themselves. We must be able to assist in training a large number of local personnel to spread scientific knowledge and technology in their own countries. Then our efforts will have a significant effect on world production. In a world that is two-thirds agricultural, this program must focus on improving the production of food and fibers. However, at the same time, we should keep in mind that as we increase the application of science to agriculture, many industrial developments must also go hand in hand. If there are no roads to transport products to the market, increasing food production is of little value. Therefore, railways and trucks, refrigerators and warehouses, canning factories and distribution agencies are necessary. Fertilizers, pesticides, and tools are also indispensable. In short, the various benefits that our country's agriculture has benefited from industry must also be popularized in these countries, because our country's agriculture, without the assistance of industry, would not be more effective than the agriculture of the countries we intend to assist." Morse said that the International Labor Organization has just established the International Labor Organization's Asian Technical Training Center in New Delhi, India, with Anderson of San Francisco as the director. Anderson is an expert known for developing the wartime training system for Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. Morse said that the International Labor Organization's European Technical Training Center has also been established in Rome, led by British Deputy Labor Secretary Ross. The training center will temporarily focus on the needs of Italy, but will later turn its attention to the technical assistance needs of the entire Europe. The Latin American Technical Training Center is in the planning stage, and the Near East Technical Training Center is in the investigation stage. These regional training centers will provide guidance and services to countries that need economic and technical assistance for development. (US News Service)

### Yiyuan's Accumulated Water Makes It Unusable: Dongqing Changes to Today's Decisive Battle; Thousands of Fans Made Futile Trips Yesterday

[Reported by this newspaper] The Dongqing final battle of the Three Strong Football Invitation Tournament was again postponed by one day due to continuous rain. The Yiyuan field was covered in accumulated water and was too damp. To protect the field, it had to be postponed for one day and rescheduled to be held at Yiyuan at 3:30 PM today. Thousands of fans waited anxiously and made futile trips yesterday. The organizers deeply apologize. All tickets today are 10,000 yuan. To improve the order at the entrance of Yiyuan, tickets will be sold in advance at the Municipal Gymnasium from 12:00 noon. Tickets will not be sold at the entrance of Yiyuan. In addition to military police maintaining order, the Siwei Boy Scouts will be at the venue to assist. Qingbai team announces that all team members will gather at the Shuanglong Bathhouse at 2:30 PM to depart, and those who are late will not be waited for. Today's referee is Fang Rongfu, and the linesmen are Chen Fubao and Xu Guoliang. The lineups of the two teams are listed below:

Donghua

Zhang Banglun

Wu Qixiang, Xie Xichuan, Zhang Lingen

Chen Lianglian, Li Kongjin, Hannibo, Yu Zhixing

Li Yao, Gao Xiuqing, Han Longhai, Chen Mingzhe, Qian Yuanqing, Guan Yongchang

Qingbai

Huang Shijie

Yan Shixin, Jiang Qing, Qiang Yuanzhi

Zhang Renyi, Qian Changrong, Meng Yiliang, Fu Naitang

Jin Lusheng, Luo Shoufu, Liu Longxin, Liu Tiyin, Gu Yi, Fei Chunhua

Historically, the Dongqing battle has always been a sensation in Shanghai, and this time is no exception. The two teams encountered each other last Thursday. Because they were fighting in heavy rain, it was temporarily changed to a friendly match. Donghua only had ten players to play, and the result was a 1-1 draw, which shows that Donghua's strength has not diminished. The team's goalkeeper is Zhang Banglun, our World Games representative, who is steady and extraordinary, and has a good grasp of the upper, middle, and lower routes. On the defensive side, there are three brave generals: Wu Qixiang, Zhang Lingen, and Hannibo, who are able to cope with the group of new players from Qingbai. Chen Lianglian received high praise for his role in the match against the railway team. The four forwards, Han Longhai, Chen Mingzhe, Gao Xiuqing, and Li Yao, are skilled, especially Longhai's skills, which are most admired. Today, when playing against Qingbai, they will surely exert their power.

Qingbai, the newly crowned champion of this year's league, is the pride of the current football scene. In addition to the original team members, Yan Shixin, a former national team player who has been retired for a long time, is returning to the field, which shows the team's importance to this match. The team's offensive lineup is complete. Jin Lusheng and Luo Shoufu are quite fierce, and Liu Longxin is as still as a tiger cub and as agile as a rabbit. He has received good reviews in the previous two performances. Fei Chunhua, after returning to Shanghai from Hong Kong, has made rapid progress in his skills. When he flies with Jin Lusheng on both wings, he will definitely pose a threat to Donghua. Meng Yiliang will be in charge of the center defense line and will do his best to organize Han Longhai's rapid breakthrough. Whether Meng can stop Longhai will be the key to the victory or defeat of both sides today. In short, it is inevitable that there will be a fierce battle between the two heroes. Which of the three teams will win the championship depends on today's battle.

### First Division Table Tennis League: Hualian Plays Postal Today

In the fourth table tennis league, there were originally two first-division matches today (24th): Postal B vs. Silk White, and Hualian vs. Postal. We have received a notice from the Silk White team that the silk industry ball room has other uses and cannot compete. Therefore, the Postal B vs. Silk White match will be rescheduled. All matches scheduled in the silk industry ball room in this week's schedule will be rescheduled.

Hualian has won three out of three matches. This is their fourth time playing. If they can pass this test against Postal, they will continue to face the three strong teams of Silk White, All Green, and United Star, to compete for the championship. Postal has performed four times and although they have three losses and one win, their strength is not inferior to Hualian. They will definitely go all out to win. Today's schedule is as follows:

Hualian - Postal (First Division) 6:00 PM, Jingfen

(Hualian) Zhang Zhihong, Deng Xiurong, Li Zhen, Lu Wenliang, Zhong Zhihui, Pan Rixi, Yang Zhixiong.

(Postal) Liu Zaoshi, Wang Xianzhang, Wang Chuanyao, Jiang Chunshan, Zhuang Kunrong, Yang Peitian, Dong Wenshao.

The other day, Lingyun in the Second Division B put in a lot of effort. Lingyun was greatly threatened by Yongwu due to the loss of veteran players Wang Weirong and Hu Yangshu. Fortunately, Yang Shixiang defeated Yongwu's Deng Bingyi with two wins and one loss, leveling the score to 2-2. In the final match, Yongwu's veteran Zhong Huiquan fought fiercely against the opponent's young player Gu Yunfang. The two fought fiercely for three games. Zhong was physically exhausted and had to retire. Gu Yunfang won with two wins and one loss. As a result, Lingyun defeated Yongwu with three wins and two losses. In addition, due to Shanbao's withdrawal, the previous one point loss was cancelled out. Currently, with a record of seven wins and seven losses, they are at the top. The results of both sides are recorded as follows:

(Lingyun) Score (Yongwu)

Wang Genlin 2-0 Lin Yonglun

Wang Weirong 0-2 Chen Zhenan

Hu Yangshu 0-2 Guo Maozhi

Yang Shixiang 2-1 Deng Bingyi

Gu Yunfang 2-1 Zhong Huiquan

### University Joint Football Team Established: Will Arrange Matches with Strong Teams Soon

### British Foreign Secretary Bevin's Emerging Prominence

The most important conference in postwar Europe—the Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference—opened in Paris on the 23rd. Among the four foreign ministers attending the conference, the most prominent is British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin (1881–). He is now a very important figure in the British House of Commons and throughout British society. However, just nine years ago, when he was fifty-seven years old, he had not yet directly participated in political circles, let alone becoming a minister or member of parliament.

He originally devoted himself to the trade union movement. Prime Minister Churchill personally promoted him to the cabinet and arranged a position for him in parliament. When he first took office as Minister of Labour, Britain was busy mobilizing for war. Because he had a thorough understanding of his work, his subordinates' loyalty to him was unparalleled. He was a close collaborator with Prime Minister Churchill. In 1945, he began to serve as Foreign Secretary. By then, he had a thorough understanding and skillful technique of diplomacy, could handle things smoothly in parliament, and had very close contact with the general public. So it can be said that he didn't need to "fear" anyone.

Speaking of Bevin's background, it is very pitiful. He came from a poor family, and his parents died when he was not yet eight years old. When he was eleven years old, he ran to Bristol alone and worked as a servant in a hotel. Later, he worked as a railway escort, a grocery store assistant, and a driver. Because he was a driver, he began to contact the workers at the Bristol Docks. At this time, he joined the drivers' group of the Docks Union. From this time on, he truly participated in the trade union movement.

In 1920, he delivered his famous eleven-hour speech at the Transport Workers Inquiry Office, and as a result, he won a fixed minimum wage standard for dockworkers. In this way, he was given the honorary title of "Dockworkers' Advocate." In September 1936, he was elected chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions. He continued to hold this position in the following year. In May 1940, he became Minister of Labour, and in October of the same year, he joined the wartime cabinet.

From 1945, Bevin became Foreign Secretary. There are a few great men in the world who come from humble backgrounds, who are inferior to the middle class in terms of money and education, but who finally achieve everlasting success through their own efforts. Bevin is one of them.

### Looking Westward at Xikang

— Wang Jiaqi

[Kangding Dispatch] Going westward from Kangding, after climbing over a mountain four thousand meters above sea level, one discovers a different world. The boundless grasslands also contain sparse hills. Everywhere you look, you see a vast green wilderness, which immediately freshens and broadens your horizons. When the party's warm sun shines on the earth, this tranquil frontier, like Iceland in the Arctic Circle, is filled with a very strong religious atmosphere. The towering buildings constructed from granite on the plains, from a distance, resemble Western architecture. The groups of leisurely cattle and sheep, and the tall, sturdy, and simple shepherds, evoke the style of ancient Greece.

Maintaining Chinese Courtesy

Most of the residents of Xikang Province are Tibetans. Although they do not pay attention to material civilization, their exquisite craftsmanship in residential buildings, embroidery, Buddhist statues, murals, reliefs, clothing, and utensil decorations is not inferior to that of our inland areas. In social aspects, they retain the courteous manners of ancient China and often perform chivalrous deeds. They value politeness more than modern Han Chinese. This can be seen from the presentation of "Hada," which means "joyful silk," similar to the ancient practice of "presenting silk." The etiquette includes bowing, kowtowing, sticking out the tongue, and a head-touching ritual, similar to kissing in Western culture, implying intimacy. Social interaction between men and women has a Western flavor; their interactions are completely open and free, without any feudal restrictions. Formal unions between men and women also involve very solemn and interesting rituals. Wedding ceremonies vary from place to place, but the expression of emotions is very humorous.

Lamaism prevails within the region because the residents are Tibetan. Their lives are as beautiful and peaceful as the natural environment. They all devoutly believe in religion and worship lamas. If a family has one son, he must be sent to a lama temple; if they have three sons, they must send two. Can you say this is a foolish thing? They believe in their hearts that this is a sacred and honorable act. Their faith in lamas is as incomprehensible as Westerners' faith in Christianity.

Special Ethnic Groups Coexisting

Within Daofu and Ganzi, gold deposits are extremely abundant. Everywhere, you can see locals digging gold mines. Unfortunately, they lack new exploration tools and methods, burying these countless valuable mineral resources! The production of furs and medicinal materials is also a major export of Xikang. If our government can actively develop Xikang, it will be a limitless source of wealth.

Xikang's industry has also made significant progress in recent years. In Ya'an, there is a provincial woolen mill that exports products to various provinces in China. Tanneries can produce shoe leather, leather clothing, and patterned leather. The newsprint produced by paper mills is sold to Chengdu and other places. The scale and effectiveness are quite impressive. In addition, there are also timber mills and alcohol factories, all of which have achieved good results.

Mongols who migrated south to Xikang have been completely assimilated by the Tibetan Muslims. Those who remained in the "Horzhang" area, not developing southward with the majority, have assimilated into the Donggan Hui, but like their counterparts on the banks of the Xianqu River, they have only been partially assimilated. They live on the east bank of the Daxia River between Lanzhou and Linxia, under the jurisdiction of Linxia County, only twenty miles from Linxia County. Centered in Suonanba, they fully believe in Islam, and their living habits are completely indistinguishable from those of Muslims. From the white hats worn by men and the headscarves worn by women, and their strict adherence to Islamic rules, one would undoubtedly be convinced that they are Donggan Hui people. This can also be called a unique ethnic group within Xikang.

Agricultural Products No Less Than Jiangnan

On the edge of Xikang, there is also a very unfamiliar area, Ningxia. Although it once had a period of brilliant historical memories, for thousands of years, Ningxia has been buried in the mountains on the frontier, silently failing to attract the attention of the Chinese people. It was not until the end of the Anti-Japanese War that its strategic importance, the rapid changes in the world situation, and the shifting of the domestic war situation, along with the completion of the Leixi and Xixiang highways, that it became an important rear military and political area. Xichang, the capital of Ningxia, became the center of military and political affairs on the southwestern border, rivaling Chongqing, Kunming, Chengdu, and Guiyang, becoming a cornerstone of the anti-Japanese war in the rear. Therefore, it can be seen that it occupies a very important position in the southwest's national defense, industry, and transportation, especially with its large population and endless mineral resources. Geographically and in terms of national defense, it serves as the boundary between Sichuan, Xikang, and Yunnan provinces, and connects India and Burma, becoming the throat of international transportation lines. Ningxia was originally part of Sichuan. When Xikang Province was established in the 28th year of the Republic of China, it was placed under Xikang under the principle of "Sichuan assisting Xikang," becoming one of the most essential parts of Xikang along with Ya'an. Most of the residents are Lisu, with Han Chinese and Tibetan interspersed among them. Ningxia's agricultural products are no less abundant than the prosperous areas of Jiangnan provinces. Due to the mild climate, all kinds of products are available, and the sericulture industry, in particular, has a very promising future.

How to Develop Xikang

From a cultural perspective, one cannot entirely praise this overly religious culture with bias, but one cannot deny its inherent beauty. For example, in recent years, border education has always tried to instill our set of values into a nation with different tastes, neglecting their inherent values. Therefore, the effort is doubled, but the result is nil!

Looking at the overall situation of Xikang, although their material civilization is far inferior to other provinces, their spiritual civilization has undeniable greatness. Today, we must no longer close our eyes and say that the Tibetan culture of Xikang is inferior; we can only say that their culture is somewhat different from ours. They are also cells of the great Chinese nation. In the future, how to integrate and exchange the cultures of this large group of people, and how to develop and prosper this uncultivated virgin land, is a matter that cannot be ignored.

### Inside Story of Fujian-Southern Clan Fighting (Continued)

Legend has it that during the Qing Dynasty, a county magistrate used the method of "killing to stop killing" to curb clan fighting, killing more than a dozen troublemakers at once. As a result, those who were fond of fighting changed their colors upon hearing this and dared not cause trouble again. Unfortunately, there were few officials of this kind. More often, when an official took office or when clan fighting was brewing, they would post a strict prohibition notice as usual. Afterward, they would either close their eyes and ignore it, or act tough or soft, pretending and feigning, taking the opportunity to make a "clan fighting fortune." The ignorant people saw through the weaknesses of the officials, despised the power of the law, and acted recklessly. This method of indulging evil and fostering trouble is one of the reasons for the rampant clan fighting.

After clan fighting occurred, public mediators would come out to run around and mediate as usual. Even if they controlled the official's residence, or the officials took the initiative to investigate and arrest people, in the end, every case was settled by the public mediators. These people who acted as public mediators were mostly "fan" figures (those who are good at inciting), unscrupulous gentry, and the like. Once they became clan fighting mediators, both sides had to send straw sandal fees, activity fees, and thank-you money. Moreover, no matter which side they went to, they could enjoy sincere offerings, often including large dishes, meat, old wine, opium, mahjong, prostitutes... Because the benefits were great and they enjoyed a lot of happiness, they almost became "professional mediators." For every clan fighting incident, they not only hoped that it would last for a long time or become bigger and bigger, but they would even create waves out of nothing, or make a mountain out of a molehill, deliberately provoking. These people, nominally mediators, are actually criminals, and they should bear part of the responsibility for the inability to eradicate clan fighting.

Clan fighting is a business with the purpose of killing people, but it is also an expensive business. Money is no less important than manpower in clan fighting. Having more men means daring to fight, and at the same time, having more money means being able to launch a clan fight with confidence. Weapons and equipment require money, dealing with public mediators requires money, compensating for injuries and deaths requires money, hiring people to go to jail requires money, and bribing the government requires money... and a huge sum of "life money" must be prepared to kill people. Money is indeed the guarantee of victory in clan fighting. In Fujian-Southern, because there are many overseas Chinese and many remittances from abroad, many people who like clan fighting think this way: "Violating the national law can be dealt with by national currency. If money is spent, people will be fine. What's the big deal with continuing!" Whenever clan fighting occurs, they levy funds heavily in the villages (in fact, most of this is overseas remittances), and telegraph their relatives in Southeast Asia to report an emergency. In their minds: "We who are in the village work hard and risk our lives, and you who are abroad should provide the money." And because overseas Chinese have a strong sense of homeland, they cannot bear to see their hometown suffer losses, so they often respond to every request. In this way, "overseas Chinese money" and "Eastern and Western Buddhas" become the left and right arms of clan fighting.

Clan Fighting Revived

In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, Qian Dongliang, the brigade commander of the garrison in Fujian-Southern, was a tough guy. He always adopted the method of "using heavy punishment in times of chaos" to maintain social order. Once, when "Eastern and Western Buddhas" in Jinjiang were brewing a conflict, he had all the idols, large and small, in the county's temples gathered and burned. For clan fighting, there was also a warning of "no mercy." At that time, the people's patriotic enthusiasm was high, and they paid less attention to personal disputes. Then, overseas remittances were cut off, prices soared, and society generally became impoverished. Without fuel, clan fighting naturally could not ignite.

However, after the victory, clan fighting "revived." This, of course, has its reasons.

First, eight years of wartime life were really too depressing. Now that everyone has taken a breath, they are in the mood to recall the past. As a result, trivial hatreds and disputes accumulated during the war are all brought together, wanting to make a big deal out of a small matter through clan fighting.

Second, overseas remittances are flowing smoothly, and life is relatively stable, so there is no shortage of capital for clan fighting. And with the prevailing wind of welcoming gods and temple fairs, disputes between Eastern and Western Buddhas become more frequent.

Third, returning overseas Chinese have brought back a lot of American weapons. These things are good Pipa hanging on the wall. If they are not played, they feel unwilling. Taking them to fish, hunt birds, or shoot into the sky is really unbearable, so they have to find an opportunity to perform and show off. And the heroes who like to fight feel even more confident about these weapons, so they have more confidence in launching clan fighting.

The Fu and Huang families in Yanshanbao, Huizhou Town, Nan'an, had a clan fight due to cowherds grazing their cattle across the border. Both sides borrowed guns, dug trenches, and sent out posts to their clan villages and allied villages for help. At one point, they opened fire, and gunshots were heard everywhere. The Fu family also accidentally detonated a self-made bomb, injuring two people.

The two villages of Panhu and Jiupu in the southern suburbs of Jinjiang also had a clan fight because cattle unintentionally trampled on some crops. It was extinguished several times, but then revived due to trivial matters. Incidents of intercepting and beating people were frequent. The last time, it involved more than a dozen villages of "Eastern and Western Buddhas," full of murderous intent, and the situation was turbulent. Traffic in the southern suburbs was cut off until the commissioner and county magistrate heard the news and brought a large number of county defense forces and police to the countryside to suppress it.

The Jiang and Wu families in Shishi District, Jinjiang, had a falling out because they thought that opening a tombstone was harmful to "feng shui." This not only involved the entire Jiang and Wu families in southern Jinjiang and "Eastern and Western Buddhas," but even the Wu family in the neighboring county of Nan'an sent representatives to participate, causing a "city-wide disturbance." On the most tense days, even the upstairs of the shops in Shishi Street was fitted with machine guns, which was truly terrifying. It was about to break out. Fortunately, the authorities sent personnel and troops to suppress the situation and persuaded them to stop fighting, so there was no major chaos.

The Zhang and Wang families in Luoyang Town, Hui'an, had a dispute over land encroachment caused by the relocation of ancestral graves, which also brewed into a battle from the destruction of graves with weapons. Later, the government sent a team to arrest some people on the ground, and the fighting spirit was thereby extinguished.

The Su and Chen families in Tong'an also had repeated clan fighting because they thought that building an ancestral hall was harmful to "feng shui." A month ago, the situation escalated, involving four or five townships, mobilizing tens of thousands of men to prepare for war. Even when the commissioner's office sent troops to suppress the situation, the villagers' sentries shouted passwords at the officers and soldiers, preventing them from advancing. The entire Tong'an was in a state of high alert. The authorities in Tong'an, fearing that bandits would take the opportunity to cause trouble, implemented a night curfew and ordered shops to close early under police supervision. This state of affairs took half a month to calm down under the active handling of the authorities.

Cow grazing, tomb sites, ancestral halls, "feng shui"—these extremely small or insignificant things actually stir up clan fighting, which is resolved by means of bloodshed and murder. How can this not make people laugh and cry!

### Folk Song Laboratory - Performance Notes of the Suixing Society

— Chen Shufeng

[Guangzhou Dispatch] The spark of folk songs was initially ignited by the Anti-Japanese War. Before this, due to the advocacy of Xia Libin, Chinese-style tunes gradually appeared in the Chinese music scene. However, what was called Chinese-style at that time mostly referred to composing with a pentatonic scale. Liu Xue'an wrote the most works of that time, such as "Fallen Petals," "Spring Night Sounds of Flutes in Luoyang," etc. But the tunes that time, apart from the pentatonic scale (although "Hearing the Flute" has a seventh note) still used the Western concepts of major and minor scales. The termination of the music still ended on the tonic of the major scale, not daring to write things in the Re mode, or other modes. Therefore, the things written in the early stage sounded a bit like Chinese tunes, but they were not authentic enough, or they could be said to be only like very elegant recitations by literati. "Hearing the Flute" is in this style.

At the same time, rhythm is of course also included. Huang Jinwu's "Three Wishes of the Rose," "Farmers' Joy," Xue Ting's "Fallen Petals," "Spring Night Sounds of Flutes in Luoyang" were essentially Western rhythms, so the Chinese flavor was diluted.

After this period passed, the Anti-Japanese War came, and folk songs exploded in the masses, or it can be said that they blossomed again. "Lugou Answering" used the Little Herdboy tune (arranged by Tian Cong), "Qin Qiong Visits Friends" (lyrics by Tian Cong) used the Pear Syrup Candy tune, and spread very quickly. The work of exploration deepened even further. In the third year of the Anti-Japanese War (1939), the Guangxi song "Pomegranate Green" was also notated. These coming to the Chinese music scene were of course like fresh fruits, full of sweet juice.

Folk Songs in Concerts

But before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, folk songs were mostly used by political work teams for propaganda. In the year approaching victory, some unconventional vocal music students took folk songs to study (that was still during the Qingmuguan era of the Conservatory of Music and its branch). At that time, the professors did not show much interest in folk songs. The "inner ears" of the vocal music professors were filled with sounds like opera, and they had not yet discovered the beauty of the sounds of folk songs. Until one time, a folk song concert was held, and almost every song was well received and asked to be sung again. The vocal music professors then began to pay attention to folk songs. Later, the students held many singing method seminars, slowly looking for their own national form of singing. Last time, Huang Yuanyin's work in the Northwest was one of his own efforts to discover singing methods. (To be continued)

### 20,000 Tons of Rice Arrive in Shanghai Today - Determined to Complete the Emergency Transport in Four Days - Allocate 300 Trucks to Transport and Store in the Racecourse

[Our Report] Although Shanghai's food problem is serious, fortunately, the Municipal Government's Food Purchase and Storage Committee, the US Economic Cooperation Administration, the US Aid Committee, the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee, and state-owned banks have closely cooperated and worked together to overcome various difficulties. The total amount of rice and flour currently held by the government in Shanghai is more than 50,000 tons, and private grain reserves also reach about 40,000 tons. It can be seen that the city's grain reserves are still sufficient. The city's food supply has not been interrupted. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haitian vessel, loaded with more than 8,754 tons of rice from Bangkok, the Haile vessel, loaded with 8,875 tons of rice from Yangon, and the Hongzhang vessel, loaded with 2,141 tons of rice from Bangkok, are coming to Shanghai separately. The Haitian and Hongzhang vessels contain US aid rice from the Economic Cooperation Administration, while the rice loaded on the Haile vessel was purchased by the China Trust Bureau and is also rationed rice. The Haitian and Haile vessels are scheduled to arrive at Tongsha at 6:00 PM yesterday, and the Hongzhang vessel is expected to arrive at Tongsha this morning. The three vessels will enter the port together this morning. The Haitian and Haile vessels will dock at the Zhanghuabang Railway Wharf for unloading, and the Hongzhang vessel is scheduled to dock at the Wusong Naval Wharf for unloading. After discussions between the Food Purchase Committee, the US Economic Cooperation Administration, the Municipal Government, and the Garrison Headquarters, it was decided to dispatch approximately 300 trucks to Wusongkou. Under the protection of the military and police and the supervision of representatives from various agencies, they will be transferred to the urban area and stored in the racecourse. This work will begin this afternoon and will continue day and night, and it is expected to be completed in four days. In addition, the Ministry of Finance has approved the Food Purchase Committee's grain funds, most of which have been paid by state-owned banks, so the committee has been able to purchase and store a portion of flour. Furthermore, the relief rice shipped from the United States by the Economic Cooperation Administration has also set off for Shanghai and should arrive in Shanghai if the situation does not change. The large amount of food controlled by the government is a guarantee that the city's household rations will continue uninterrupted. Currently, the expectation of all parties is that government agencies will continue to work hard to purchase and store food while the supply is still open, and implement fair distribution when necessary so that all six million citizens can be free from the fear of shortage, and especially provide practical guarantees for the poor people who are unable to hoard food.

### Preventing Rationed Rice Fraud - Dispatching Personnel to Intensify Supervision

[Central News Agency] According to the People's Livelihood Investigation Office: the second phase of rice rationing per capita in May began on the 23rd of this month and ended on the 26th. The rationed food is divided into three types, and the rationed prices are different, which makes it easy for unscrupulous rice shops to commit fraud, embezzle public property, and exploit citizens. At this time of crisis, it must be strictly investigated and dealt with. In addition to the supervisory committee members, district commissioners, and field investigators of the office intensifying supervision, a public notice has been issued asking citizens to pay attention to reporting at any time, and it is hoped that all rice shops will abide by the law and refrain from committing crimes.

### The Second Half of This Year's Land Value Tax - Scheduled to Begin Collection on the 26th

After receiving the payment notice, businesses should pay within five days. If the tax is paid after the deadline, a fine of 5% will be added every day, and the adjustment will be made according to the index at the time of payment.

### Fixed-Amount Banknotes Recalled; National Bank Begins Redemption Yesterday

[Our Report] The redemption of fixed-amount banknotes issued by the Central Bank began yesterday. The bank believes that its existing cash and silver dollars are sufficient to meet the needs of currency circulation. Furthermore, counterfeit 500,000 yuan fixed-amount banknotes have been discovered. Therefore, since last week, the bank has only been accepting but not issuing these banknotes, and yesterday it began a comprehensive redemption program. It is reported that the total value of fixed-amount banknotes issued by the bank is around 3 trillion yuan, with the highest denomination being 5 million yuan. The purpose of starting the redemption is to expedite the return of the fixed-amount banknotes, not to indicate that these banknotes have been taken out of circulation.

[China United Press] The address for redeeming banknotes at the Central Bank is on the third floor of the Central Bank vault at 15 The Bund. A large number of people went to redeem the banknotes, but due to the curfew on The Bund, people entered and exited through the side door of the Central Bank next to Er Ma Road. The Central Bank had considered moving its office to the Bank of Communications building on Nanjing West Road due to the inconvenient traffic on The Bund. However, because the structure of the Treasury and two other bureaus are too massive and difficult to move, the bank continued to operate at the original address yesterday.

### Postal Transport Relies Entirely on Air; Citizens Urged to Affix Sufficient Airmail Postage for Mail Sent to Various Locations

### Panic and Scarce Trading; Gold Market Declines

[Our Report] In yesterday's gold market, due to heavy pressure from the authorities, all parties were wary and dared not act rashly. Most firms temporarily suspended trading due to tight rumors. However, because there was no off-exchange price, and the difference was significant, the price was nominally raised to the 11.4662 billion ceiling, with trade not done. Off-exchange trading was delayed until around 10:00 AM before it began. Initial bids were 22 billion and 25 billion, with no transactions. In an instant, the price fell three levels. At 10:15 AM, the price retreated to the 20 billion range, as low as 19 billion and 22 billion. Around noon, due to rumors that the Central Bank would sell again, morale was weak. Amid a wave of selling, the lowest price fell to 13 billion and 16 billion. The price rebounded slightly to 16 billion and 19 billion at noon.

[Our Report] The Central Bank's silver dollar exchange rate was adjusted again yesterday, with the new price being 36 million Gold Yuan Certificates per silver dollar.

[Our Report] The Political Affairs Committee of the Jinghu-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters made three important resolutions yesterday to eliminate the silver dollar black market in the city: (1) Merchants in the city who hold silver dollar trading licenses may also engage in the trading of silver coins. The buying and selling prices must strictly adhere to the Central Bank's exchange rate. In addition to a 2% handling fee, no other fees may be charged.

(2) When customers pay for goods in silver dollars or silver coins, all stores in the city shall convert the price according to the Central Bank's exchange rate. (3) Violators of the above regulations will be punished for disrupting financial order.

Trading is Quiet; Prices Decline

[Our Report] Yesterday's silver dollar market was quiet because all parties were wary. Street trading has become quiet. Silver "bulls" generally dared not trade, and bidding has declined. Around noon, the Central Bank's listing rose again to 36 million, gradually approaching the black market. At noon, Sichuan dollars were being sold at 36 million. In the afternoon, the situation stabilized, and general businesses resumed listing prices, with all versions being 33 million for buying and 36 million for selling.

### The Market Still Has No Transactions; Retail Rice Prices Decline

The north and south rice markets still have no transactions. Most goods owners have no goods for sale. Rice shops, because retail sales have household registered rice supplied, are not taking on inventory, so transactions have not been done. Market price lists have not yet been issued. Retail rice prices also declined following the fall in gold and silver.

### All Citizens Unite to Fight Against the Invisible Enemy; Mayor Broadcasts the Significance of Expanding the Cleanliness Campaign

[Central News Agency] Mayor Chen broadcasted to the city's citizens at 6:00 PM yesterday on Shanghai Radio, titled "The Significance of Expanding the Cleanliness Campaign." The full text of the broadcast is recorded as follows:

Fellow Citizens: The Battle for Shanghai has entered its second ten days. At this time and place, advocating for a cleanliness campaign is of great significance. We know that the invisible enemy and the visible enemy must both be defeated. With the cooperation of our military and civilians, we are very confident in defeating the visible enemy. But there is also an invisible enemy that the naked eye cannot see, which is germs. They can also destroy our lives and property. Therefore, we must defeat them and eliminate them. Therefore, this expanded cleanliness campaign is undoubtedly a part of defending Greater Shanghai. I hope that all 6 million of our citizens will work hard to participate, so that it can be coordinated with the fighting and killing of the enemy in the war, and achieve great success. Shanghai, is the fourth largest metropolis in the world, and is the center of industry and commerce in our country. Its current status is even more important, but because the population is too dense, some citizens have not yet developed public health habits, so in terms of cleanliness, it is not yet comparable to major cities in various countries. Every year, as summer approaches, germs multiply, which easily causes epidemics, and the lives of citizens are seriously threatened. According to statistics, sometimes more people die from diseases than from the battlefield, which is no exaggeration to call them invisible enemies. Germs are produced by unclean drinking water, food, and air environment, and the most important reason is the improper disposal of garbage, feces, and sewage. Shanghai has a population of 6 million, and produces more than 3,000 tons of garbage every day. In addition, during the Anti-Japanese War, the enemy and puppets swept but did not transport the garbage, and more accumulated. After the victory, although a lot of money was spent to remove more than 600,000 tons of accumulated garbage, due to manpower, material resources, financial resources, and the inconvenient transportation on the Suzhou River, the cleaning work was difficult to achieve the intended ideal. Since then, expanding the cleanliness campaign, the first goal is to clean up the garbage, the main base of these germs. This matter is of great importance, and it must be completed with the full cooperation of all citizens. The second goal is to have everyone pay attention to the hygiene of one person and one family, and pay more attention to public health, and develop good cleaning habits. Because the uncleanliness of one person endangers the lives of most people, their sin is unforgivable. In short: The purpose of this expanded cleanliness campaign is to hope that all our citizens will unite to put out our invisible enemies. The municipal government will do everything possible and work together. In addition to mobilizing the Sanitation Bureau, the Police Bureau, the Civil Affairs Bureau, and the Public Works Bureau, and launching a large-scale cleanup through Baojia leaders, it also requires all citizens to pay attention to cleaning and hygiene automatically and persistently in order to achieve our intended hope. Cleanliness is a necessary condition for obtaining health, and health is the greatest wealth of people, which everyone should strive for. Compatriots, work hard, work hard to defeat the visible enemy, and work hard to defeat the invisible enemy, work hard to win victory, work hard to win health, and finally wish you all good health.
