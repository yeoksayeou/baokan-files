### The Chinese Communists Brazenly Order a General Offensive; Communist Troops Land Near荻港; Major Battle Unfolds Between 蕪湖 and 銅陵

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] The peace talks, which had been underway in Peiping for twenty days, have broken down due to the Chinese Communists' declaration of a general offensive at noon on the 21st. The Chinese Communists did not consider the government's reply to their proposals. Instead, using the government's rejection of their harsh terms as an excuse, Mao Zedong and Zhu De ordered an attack on the government-controlled areas. In fact, the offensive north of the Yangtze River, which began on the 20th, intensified on the 21st. Communist troops, disregarding everything, forcibly crossed the Yangtze River near 荻港 in pursuit of their ambition to conquer the entire country by force. The war has thus resumed. The government is now preparing to fight back, aiming to deliver a blow to those who believe in force.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] After Mao Zedong and Zhu De officially issued the order for a general offensive, the situation south of the Yangtze River suddenly became tense. General Commander-in-Chief of the 京沪杭 region, Tang Enbo, in order to strike at the Communist forces and protect the area south of the Yangtze River, specially flew from Shanghai to the Xiaolingwei area of Nanjing by plane at 8 AM on the 21st to take command and direct all operations. Furthermore, Air Force Commander-in-Chief Zhou Zhirou flew by special plane from Nanjing to inspect the front lines along the Yangtze River at 2 PM on the 21st, returning around 4 PM.

### Sketch Map of the Area Between Nanjing and 安廣

[Our Newspaper, Wuhu, 21st dispatch] The largest battle since the Chinese Communists issued the general offensive order began on the night of the 20th in the river area west of Wuhu, from San Shan Zhen, through Youfang Zui, Huali, and 荻港, to Tongling, a distance of approximately one hundred 里. The 24th, 25th, and 27th divisions of Chen Yi's forces, stationed on the north bank of the Yangtze River in that area, first occupied the sandbars in the river, including Heisha, Xuehua, Taiyang, Baima, and Wenyu, near Tuqiao and Jia Du. Then, starting at 5 PM on the 20th, they concentrated artillery fire on the south bank, heavily damaging most of the fortifications of the National Army along the river. Starting at 11 PM on the night of the 20th, they used over a hundred various types of vessels to transport seven or eight thousand Communist troops, who landed on the south bank. After fierce resistance from the National Army, by dawn on the 21st, the entire central area from Tongling in the west, through Shunan and Fanchang, to Hengshan and San Shan Zhen in the east, had fallen. Currently, the National Army on the south bank is urgently dispatching large forces to block and counterattack with all its might.

[Our Newspaper, Wuhu, 21st dispatch] Day and night on the 21st, the National Air Force dispatched planes to bomb and strafe the Communist troops who had landed between San Shan, 荻港, and Tongling. Besides some casualties, most of the Communist troops dispersed and hid in the villages and fields. All the vessels used by these seven or eight thousand Communist troops to cross the river were bombed and destroyed by the Air Force. However, tonight, taking advantage of the darkness, the Communist troops on the north bank continue to cross the river stealthily, disregarding the bombing. At the same time, the Communist troops who had been hiding also began to launch attacks southward from areas such as Fanchang and Shunan, attempting to consolidate and expand their bridgehead on the south bank that they have already occupied. After the arrival of reinforcements, the National Army is now counterattacking.

[Our Newspaper, Wuhu, 21st dispatch] According to reliable sources, the 88th Army of the National Army, which was responsible for the defense of the area near 荻港, except for Army Commander Yang who escaped with a special service battalion, the whereabouts of the rest remain unknown as of the evening of the 21st. It is reported that the 88th Army was formerly reorganized from the Parachute General Headquarters, and its equipment is better than that of ordinary units. The previous army commander was Ma Shigong.

### Order from Mao Zedong and Zhu De

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] According to a broadcast from the Peiping Xinhua Radio Station, the full text is as follows: "Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De issued the following order to the People's Liberation Army today:

Comrades Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, and Zhang Jichun of the First Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, comrades Chen Yi, Su Yu, and Tan Zhenlin of the Third Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, comrades Lin Biao and Luo Ronghuan of the Fourth Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, comrades Xu Xiangqian, Zhou Shidi, and Luo Ruiqing of the People's Liberation Army on the Taiyuan front, all field army commanders and fighters, comrades of the People's Liberation Army in the southern guerrilla areas, the domestic peace agreement drafted by the delegation of the Chinese Communist Party and the delegation of the Nanjing Kuomintang government, after a long period of negotiations, has been rejected by the Nanjing Kuomintang government. The responsible personnel of the Nanjing Kuomintang government rejected this domestic peace agreement because they are still obeying the orders of American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek, attempting to prevent the advancement of the Chinese people's liberation cause and to prevent the resolution of domestic problems by peaceful means. The eight articles and twenty-four clauses of the domestic peace agreement drafted through the negotiations between the two delegations provide lenient treatment for officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army and the armed forces of the Kuomintang government, and all other issues are based on the interests of the nation and the people, and appropriate solutions have been made. Rejecting this agreement means that the Kuomintang reactionaries are determined to fight their launched counter-revolutionary war to the end. Rejecting this agreement means that the peace talks proposed by the Kuomintang reactionaries on January 1 this year were merely an attempt to prevent the People's Liberation Army from advancing, so that the reactionaries could gain a respite and then stage a comeback to extinguish the revolutionary forces. Rejecting this agreement means that the Nanjing Li Zongren government's so-called recognition of China's eight peace conditions as the basis for negotiations is completely false. Since it recognizes the punishment of war criminals, the reorganization of all Kuomintang reactionary armies in accordance with democratic principles, the takeover of all powers of the Nanjing government and its subordinate governments at all levels, and other basic conditions, there is no reason to reject the specific measures drafted on the basis of these basic conditions, which are extremely lenient. Under these circumstances, we order you:

(1) Advance bravely, resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate all Kuomintang reactionaries within China who dare to resist, liberate the people of the whole country, and defend the independence and integrity of China's territorial sovereignty.

(2) Advance bravely, arrest all war criminals who are stubbornly unrepentant, and pursue the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek no matter where they flee.

(3) Announce the final revised version of the domestic peace agreement to any Kuomintang local government and local military group. If they are willing to stop the war and resolve the problem by peaceful means, you may sign a provisional agreement with them based on the general outline of this final plan.

(4) After the People's Liberation Army surrounds Nanjing, if the Nanjing Li Zongren government has not yet fled and is willing to sign the domestic peace agreement, we are willing to give the government another chance to sign. Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, April 21, 1949."

### The Capital Remains Calm as Ever; Troops Heading to the North Bank for Reinforcement Are in High Spirits

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] After the breakdown of the peace talks, the flames of war are gradually approaching the capital. Since the afternoon of the 20th, the sound of artillery fire has continued throughout the night, gradually ceasing at 10 AM on the 21st. The general situation here remains extremely calm. The riverside of Xiaguan was filled with people all day on the 21st. They knew that the artillery fire last night was from the fleet, so they were admiring the heroic posture of the ships along the river. Order at the railway station and in the streets remains as usual. There has been no panic or rush to evacuate as there was during the previous evacuation. When reporters inspected the riverside at 9 PM on the 21st, they still saw everything calm, with only faint sounds of gunfire. Some officers and soldiers were lined up by the river waiting to cross the river to reinforce the front lines. They were in excellent spirits. One of the junior officers told reporters that there were no problems at the front and that they were going to reinforce. The officer's attitude was very optimistic.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 21st dispatch] Although there has been a constant rumble of artillery fire here all day, the people remain calm, and business continues as usual.

### Full Text of the Government's Reply to the Chinese Communists

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] The text of the government's telegram to the peace delegation to be forwarded to the Chinese Communists on the 21st is as follows:

Immediately received, Chief Representative Zhang Zhizhong of the Government Peace Negotiation Delegation at the Six Nations Hotel in Peiping, and forwarded to Representatives Shao, Zhang, Li, and Liu. Representatives Huang Shaohong and Advisor Qu Wu have returned to the capital and have given a detailed account of the progress of the peace talks and brought back the full text of the "Domestic Peace Agreement" proposed by the Chinese Communist delegation. I have learned one or two things about it. Today, the country is so devastated and the people are suffering so deeply. After winning a glorious victory in the eight-year war of resistance, our international status has plummeted. All of this is due to the endless wars. As long as we can completely eliminate the scourge of war and achieve true peace, so that the people can have the opportunity to recuperate and the country can embark on the path of construction, we should spare no sacrifice to achieve this goal, so that we do not betray the original aspirations of the revolution, can answer to the ancestors of the Chinese nation above, and can give an account to future generations below. The government's side, from President Chiang's New Year's Day message advocating peace to all the measures taken after Zongren and Yingqin took charge, none of them have failed to follow the wishes of the people of the whole country for peace, and have taken the highest interests of the country and the people as the premise, seeking complete solutions, enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens, opening our hearts and minds, and painstakingly seeking peace. President Chiang's resolute resignation and Zongren's previous telegram to Mr. Mao Zedong on April 7 were all intended to sacrifice oneself to achieve the overall situation. This sincere heart should be recognized by all compatriots. However, looking at the full text of the agreement proposed by the Chinese Communists, its fundamental spirit is nothing more than the disposition of the conquered by the conquerors. Resolving the dispute of brothers fighting each other is even worse than the form of surrender of an enemy country, and a deadline for a reply is set, resembling an ultimatum. It sees the beginning of peace talks as the eve of war. Even if the government is willing to sign it under humiliation, it is feared that this narrow and coercive style will stimulate morale and public sentiment, and cause deep grief and anger. Not only are the various terms beyond the government's ability to guarantee implementation, but the adverse effects and consequences caused by this are also beyond the government's ability to remedy. If this kind of agreement is once signed, it will not give the people true peace, but a more cruel and large-scale long-term war. The people who are eagerly hoping for peace will certainly not want the government to accept this agreement, which is nominally "peace" but actually "war," leading the people of the whole country to suffer a catastrophe and betraying the original intention of seeking peace. It will inevitably create a tragic situation of revenge and eternal killing. The original preamble is full of defamation and condemnation of the government and the Chinese Kuomintang, which is equivalent to a judgment against criminals. How can it be called a peace agreement? Taking the item of reorganizing the army as an example, the armies of both sides should cease fighting and make peace, and should be reorganized at the same time to realize the principle of nationalization of the army. However, the agreement stipulates that all armed forces of the government, including all army, navy, air force, general headquarters, transportation police forces, local forces, all military organs, schools, factories, and rear service institutions, should be reorganized into the "People's Liberation Army." All military equipment and all military supplies of the government should also be handed over to the "People's Liberation Army" for acceptance. The so-called "democratic principle" has become a system of exclusive occupation by the Communist army.

Regarding the reorganization procedures, it is stipulated that there are two stages: centralized reorganization and regional reorganization. The so-called centralized reorganization means that the reorganization committee controlled by the Communist side orders the National Army to first transfer the defense zones and warehouse materials to the "People's Liberation Army" for acceptance, and then go to a place considered appropriate by the Communist army for centralization, so as to be reorganized into the "People's Liberation Army." The day when this reorganization work is completed is the time when the entire National Army is eliminated.

In the political aspect, before the establishment of a coalition government, although the government is allowed to temporarily exercise its powers, it actually acts on the orders of the Communist Army Headquarters, and its main task is to assist the Communist Army in "handling the acceptance and transfer of matters in various places." The Chinese Communists not only want to take over the government's army and the national regime, but also want to form a terroristic rule through the Military Control Commission, so as to "accept all local rights and national industrial wealth."

Regarding the issue of the Political Consultative Conference, which decides the fate of the country and the people, according to Article 23 of the agreement, "After the delegation of the Nanjing Kuomintang government signs the domestic peace agreement and the Nanjing Kuomintang government implements it, the delegation of the Chinese Communist party is willing to be held responsible to make a proposal to the preparatory committee of the new political consultative conference that the Nanjing Kuomintang government shall send a number of patriotic people as representatives to attend the new political Consultative Conference and that after the approval of the preparatory committee of the new Political Consultative Conference, the representatives of the Nanjing Kuomintang government can attend the new Political Consultative Conference." In other words, the government's participation in the CPPCC must wait until the Chinese Communist party examines the government's performance in implementing the "peace agreement," deems it satisfactory, and then agrees to be held responsible for making a proposal, pending "approval." Even if the government is "approved" to participate in the CPPCC according to the agreement, whether it can participate in the coalition government must still await the proposal of the Communist Party, and the number and candidates of the government's participation in the CPPCC and the coalition government must all be decided according to orders. The above is only a brief enumeration of several items as examples. In fact, the full text of the agreement is full of the meaning of the Chinese Communists' desire to control the whole country by force. One says "People's Liberation Army" enters, and the other says "People's Liberation Army" accepts. The so-called peace agreement is actually to make the government recognize the Chinese Communist's conquest of the entire Chinese government by force. The government's army is equivalent to a complete surrender, and the social organization and the way of life of people in all cities and villages across the country will also be completely changed according to the wishes of the Chinese Communist Party. This will inevitably arouse the anger of the military and the people. If the Chinese Communist troops march into various places and Chinese Communist personnel infiltrate various places, it is almost inevitable that they will encounter resistance from the military and the people. As a result, war and slaughter will spread to every city and village across the country. The suffering of the people will become deeper and the losses of the country will become heavier, which is inevitable and needs no deep discussion. If the matter evolves to this unfortunate point, then seeking peace will only create a source of chaos, and stopping the war will instead expand the scourge of war. This is not what those who are loyal to the country and care for the people should do or tolerate. In short, if we can truly recognize the desire of the people of the whole country for peace today and all have the sincerity to seek peace together, then we must eliminate all hostility and thoughts of revenge, and based on facts, adapt to the environment, and jointly plan reasonable and effective methods to achieve the goal of completely eliminating war and achieving true and lasting peace. Therefore, in addition to expressing the above-mentioned opinions in principle on the domestic peace agreement proposed by the Chinese Communists this time, the government still hopes that the Chinese Communist side will determine the principle that the interests of the people are above all else, and reconsider the basic spirit and content of this agreement. As for the fact that since the beginning of this year, the government troops have tried their best to retreat whenever they encountered an attack by the Communist army, the facts are all there for all to see. However, not only has the Communist side failed to stop the attacks, but since the government peace delegation arrived in Peiping on April 1, the offensives in some places have become more fierce than before, which is very regrettable. In order to foster a peaceful atmosphere, it is hoped that a temporary ceasefire agreement can be established as soon as possible, so as to show the determination and sincerity of both sides to seek true peace, so that the peace talks can proceed smoothly. This telegram is issued to express this hope. It is hoped that the above opinions will be forwarded to the Chinese Communist side and that a reply will be sent. Li Zongren, He Yingqin, April 20.

### Jiangpu Falls to the Communist Army; The Twelve Fort Bridgehead Is Also Abandoned; The National Army, Surrounded by Artillery Fire on Three Sides, Reinforces and Counterattacks

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] Jiangpu City, across the river from Nanjing in Pukou, was officially captured by the Communist army at 9 AM on the 21st. The invading Communist troops of the 35th Army, disregarding heavy casualties, launched a night-long fierce attack on the city. Although one regiment of the defending troops of Liu Bingzhe's department had the assistance of both naval and air forces, the disparity in strength was ultimately too great. By the morning of the 21st, although the cost of 5,000 Communist troop deaths and injuries had been secured, the defending troops had suffered casualties to the point where they were less than one battalion. They were ordered to retreat towards Pukou at about 8 AM this morning, and the city was captured at 9 AM. Also, the Communist forces on the Jinpu southern section of the Dongxi Ge Huachi Battalion are also constantly attacking the National Army in the two Pu areas, but they have all been repelled by the National Army.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] The 12 Fort bridgehead southwest of Yangzhou fell before dawn on the 21st after the defending troops were almost completely annihilated by the continuous four-day and four-night attacks by the 34th Army of the Communist Army. Guazhou and Liubao, across the river from Zhenjiang east of Twenty Fort, have been fiercely attacked by the 36th Army of the Communist Army since the night of the 20th, and fierce fighting is still underway as of noon on the 21st. Also, after nightfall on the 21st, the Communist Army launched an artillery battle from 12 Fort to Shiyezhou in the river, attempting to land on the island. The National Navy and Army are currently resisting.

[Another dispatch] Yangzhong Island, isolated in the Yangtze River east of Zhenjiang, is now facing artillery fire from three sides: Yong'an and Beisha Islands to the east, Laozhou to the west, and Sanjiangying and Kou'an to the north. The National Army believes that this location is strategically important and has recently reinforced its forces and launched a counterattack against the Communist Army. On the night of the 21st, several groups of Communist troops attempted to land, but were all repelled.

[Another dispatch] It is reported that the Second Third Army of Chen Yi has sneaked to Tianxingqiao in the southeast of Taiyu, attempting to cross the Yangtze River.

### The Communist Army May Launch a New Offensive Against the Outskirts of Hankou; Fierce Fighting Erupted Southeast of Huangpi Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Hengdian, 21st dispatch] Military sources: More than 3,000 troops of the 13th Army of Chen's department of the Communist Army in eastern Hubei, and more than 2,000 troops of the 43rd Army of Lin Biao's department north of Huangpi, advanced in several groups from Songbu, Huang'an Changxuan, and Dian towards the Liuzigang Balidian positions of the National Army in the southeast of Huangpi at dawn on the 21st. After the National Army joined forces with the local teams to fight bravely, the Communist Army was unable to resist and retreated to the northeast of Huangpi. According to military analysis, after the Communist Army on that line completes its assembly, it may launch a new offensive against the outskirts of Hankou within a few days.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 21st dispatch] According to what Li Pinxian declared to his colleagues at the Political Committee today, the Communist Army on the outskirts of Wuhan is moving eastward, and there will be no major battles in central China in the short term.

### Taiyuan Has Entered Street Fighting; The Defending Troops Continue to Fight Bitterly

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] According to military estimates, the offensive launched by the Communist Army against Taiyuan City in the past week has resulted in more than 50,000 casualties, and the National Army has also suffered more than 20,000 casualties. Although street fighting has begun on the evening of the 21st, the defending troops are still fighting bitterly under the narrow leadership of Generals Wang Jingguo and others.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] Regarding the Battle of Taiyuan, on the evening of the 21st, the Communist Army had infiltrated Yongyu Fort, Shangbeiguan in the northern suburbs, Wohushan in the east of the city, Shuangta Temple in the southeast of the city, and Fenqiao in the west of the city. More than 200,000 Communist troops, led by Nie Rongzhen and Xu Xiangqian, launched a face-to-face attack again starting on the evening of the 20th. Most of the forts and fortifications outside the city were razed to the ground, and most of the main buildings in the city were also destroyed by shelling. As of 6 PM on the 21st, the Communist Army launched attacks from multiple locations under the cover of artillery fire, using cloud ladders to climb the city walls. At the same time, some gaps in the city walls that had been destroyed by artillery fire were also breached. The heroic street fighting has officially begun.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th dispatch] Military sources: Zhao Xi, commander of the 61st Army of the National Army in Taiyuan, led his troops in a bloody battle with five times as many Communist troops for three days and nights in the area of Nanyidong Yijinggou southwest of Jingcheng. The Communist Army suffered more than half casualties. Ultimately, due to the disparity in numbers, Army Commander Zhao died heroically.

### Some U.S. Marines Evacuate from Nanjing to Shanghai

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] Forty-three U.S. Marines were originally stationed at the U.S. Embassy for security. Except for six who remained, the rest were ordered to evacuate to Shanghai by plane on the 21st to avoid accidents when the Communist Army captures Nanjing.

### Peace Talks Ultimately Break Down; Government Agencies Move to Guangzhou; Emergency Evacuation Begins in the Capital Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] In order to cope with the situation after the breakdown of the peace talks, the presidents and vice presidents and secretaries-general of the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, and Control Yuan held a joint meeting at 9 AM on the 21st. He Yingqin, Yu Youren, and Tong Guanxian all attended, and Acting President Li also participated. The participants all believed that after the breakdown of the peace talks, the capital would be threatened by artillery fire, and the government would have to move to Guangzhou. It was decided that an emergency evacuation would begin today. Except for the Ministry of National Defense, which would temporarily move to Shanghai, all other ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan would move to Guangzhou. The Legislative Yuan also decided to move to Guangzhou. Except for legislators who would go to Taiwan, Guilin, and Guangzhou according to their wishes, the staff of the Secretariat would all gather in Guangzhou. The date of resumption of the meeting would be decided by the president of the Yuan and then notified. The Control Yuan would also move to Guangzhou. As for the Presidential Office, it was prepared to move to Shanghai first and then to Guangzhou. All staff of the various Yuan ministries and commissions would be handled in three ways: (1) those who wish to stay in Nanjing would receive an evacuation allowance of 5 million yuan per person; (2) those who voluntarily evacuate to designated locations would arrange their own transportation and receive an evacuation allowance of 3 million yuan per person; (3) those who move with the government would have their transportation arranged in a unified manner and receive an evacuation allowance of 500,000 yuan per person. The evacuation work would begin today and was expected to be completed within three to five days. The meeting adjourned at 11 AM.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] The government began to move on the 21st after the peace talks broke down. There were not many people staying in Nanjing in various agencies, so this relocation was much easier than the previous one. It is reported that Acting President Li and President of the Executive Yuan He Yingqin will leave Nanjing after the evacuation is completed. Their departure date will depend on the development of the military situation. Presidents Yu and Tong have chosen to fly directly to Guangzhou within three or four days. Legislators and members of the Control Yuan have begun to leave Nanjing in recent days, and the rest will depart in succession at 11 PM on the 22nd. The meeting of the Legislative Yuan originally scheduled for the 22nd has been cancelled. A chartered plane of the Ministry of Finance flew from Nanjing to Shanghai at 4 PM on the 21st. Many staff members of various agencies also traveled to Shanghai by car on the afternoon of the 21st.

### Government Spokesman Comments on the Chinese Communists' Terms; They Are Expanding the War and Destroying the Nation and the People; A Surrender Document from the Victorious Country to the Defeated Country

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch] The government spokesman recently made the following preliminary comments on the so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement" proposed by the Chinese Communists: The so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement" proposed by the Chinese Communists is not a peace agreement at all, but an agreement that expands the war, harms the people, and destroys the homeland and the nation. It is completely a surrender document from the victorious country to the defeated country. In the preamble of the "agreement," all the responsibility for the war is first placed on the government's head, insisting that the government has violated the revolutionary position of the Three Principles of the People and violated the will of the people of the whole country, writing off the revolution of the past 50 years and the history of the eight-year war of resistance, and completely slandering the personality of the revolutionary martyrs and the heroic and patriotic soldiers and civilians of the whole country. These go far beyond the so-called "eight principles." What is especially bizarre is that the government only agreed to take the eight principles as the basis for negotiations, but the preamble falsely accuses us of having already recognized the eight basic conditions. In short, not a single word of the entire agreement resembles a peace agreement. Now, let's make a very fair analysis of the so-called "domestic peace agreement":

(1) In terms of the spirit of the original proposal and the revised proposal proposed by the Communist side, it is exactly the same as the surrender documents signed by Japan with the Allied countries after its defeat and the so-called local peace agreement in Peiping signed by General Fu Zuoyi with the Communist Party.

Editorial

### Zhu and Mao Expand the Scourge of War!

The Chinese Communist Party radio broadcast yesterday that Mao Zedong and Zhu De have ordered the Communist troops on the front lines to attack the Nationalists. This is their response to the government's request the day before yesterday that they reconsider the conditions they proposed. The Communist troops have indeed launched a larger-scale war, and the government has been forced to respond.

Regarding the harsh conditions of the "Peace Agreement" proposed by the CCP, the government instructed the peace talk representatives the day before yesterday that they were unable to accept them. However, it still hoped that the CCP would prioritize national interests and reconsider the harsh conditions they proposed, so that peace talks would not break down. At the same time, the Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang also issued a statement, in addition to refusing to accept the responsibility for the civil war as pointed out by the CCP, it also expressed its sincerity in seeking peace and still hoped that the CCP would rein in at the edge of the cliff and immediately issue a ceasefire order so that the Beijing peace talks, which the people of the whole country urgently hoped for, would not be interrupted. The government and the Kuomintang's sincerity in seeking peace can be said to be extremely sincere in the eyes of the common people. Knowing that the situation has reached the final critical moment and that the prospect of peace is on the verge of despair, they still place a glimmer of hope on the CCP and wait for the CCP's reply at all times in order to "turn the tide."

But on the CCP's side, let alone the harshness of the "Peace Agreement" and its high arrogance; even in terms of its attitude towards peace talks, it has not had the slightest sincerity from beginning to end. The ultimate breakdown of the Beijing peace talks was within our expectations; but no one expected the CCP to be so daring and reckless, defying the great disapproval of the world, and repeatedly acting as the leader of the war. During the process of peace talks, it not only transferred its troops in the Northeast and North China southward, deploying troops along the Yangtze River, in an attempt to strengthen its position in the peace talks through threats and force the government peace talk representatives to sign an alliance under the city; moreover, sporadic battles have never stopped. This kind of peace talk, fighting while talking, is really unprecedented. To increase the difficulty of peace talks, we had to swallow our anger and wait silently for its development. Today, the CCP's war-mongering face has been exposed without limit. The CCP not only ignored the government's request for "reconsideration," but also replaced the reply with a crossing-the-river offensive. Zhu and Mao's issuance of a general attack order to the Communist troops yesterday clearly proves who should bear the responsibility for the war.

The CCP's belief in the omnipotence of force has been fully exposed; from now on, the people of the whole country should no longer have any illusions. The issue of responsibility for the war has been clearly defined, and there will be no more ambiguity. During the era of the Political Consultative Conference, the people were influenced by the CCP and its fellow travelers, and perhaps some people who did not understand the truth were confused and could not figure out the issue of responsibility; but now the ironclad facts are placed before our eyes. Who is war-mongering? Who believes in the omnipotence of force? Who is the leader of the civil war? Can everyone still not tell the difference? Now that the government is forced to respond to the war, the people of the whole country should support the government with all their strength to fight to the end. The CCP's warmongers cannot be realized for a day. If you want peace, you can only rise up and overthrow this warmonger who believes in the omnipotence of force. Before this goal is achieved, even if we encounter any hardships or difficulties, we can only grit our teeth, endure the hard support, and never seek peace halfway, otherwise it is surrender, which will inevitably plunge the country into a situation of eternal doom, and the people will suffer all the hardships within the iron curtain.

The CCP's military development can be said to be completely accidental. All kinds of propaganda it has made to the people of the whole country can only deceive the people for a while, but it cannot permanently cover up its views. In the past, the areas controlled by the CCP were mostly in remote rural areas, and all the policies it implemented were not easy to penetrate its iron curtain, so that outsiders could see its true face. But now it has moved from the countryside to the city. Although Beijing and Tianjin have also hung up its "bamboo curtain," its weaknesses have been revealed from the loopholes. Not to mention that people's lives are not free, even in terms of all social and cultural facilities, they have to go back fifty years. We talked to a Hong Kong businessman who was deceived by the CCP and went north to exchange materials and returned. He even said, "The CCP's success is unreasonable." Although this is a statement of indignation, it can be said to be the most appropriate criticism of the CCP. Therefore, we believe that the CCP is not really terrible. The most terrible thing is the government and the Kuomintang's failure to strive for progress. If the government can learn a lesson from this and make a firm determination to reform and regenerate, then the war against the Communist Party is a war for the people's freedom and a war for the country's independence, and it will be able to win the final victory, which can be guaranteed.

In short, since the CCP has ordered a general attack, the government naturally has no choice but to be forced to respond to the war, and the war will inevitably gradually intensify on both sides of the Yangtze River, and the local devastation will be unavoidable. This is of course the misfortune of the country, but the people must know that in the face of the scourge of war, only by holding the determination to die can we seek life from death. If we still hold the mentality of seeking temporary safety and avoiding the war, we will inevitably suffer the evil consequences of self-destruction. We hope that all compatriots who do not want to be enslaved will adhere to the principle of "those who have strength contribute strength, and those who have money contribute money," and work together with one heart and one mind to support the government in this forced response to the war until the warmongers are also willing to make peace. The power of the people is great and irresistible. Since the government is fighting for freedom, fighting for independence, and fighting for peace, and has the support of the people, the final result will surely be to win true freedom and peace for the people of the whole country.

### Communist Artillery Fire Fierce on the North Bank of the Yangtze River, Two British Warships Damaged Again, "London" and "Black Swan" Return to Shanghai, 15 Communists Killed, 25 Wounded

[Report from this newspaper] According to the British Information Office, the British heavy cruiser "London" and the "Black Swan," which sailed to the scene of the incident on the morning of the 22nd to rescue the "Amethyst," were bombarded by artillery fire from the north bank when they arrived at Bateas Point and Beaber Island near Jiangyin. The two ships were slightly damaged. They retaliated at the time, but in order to avoid serious conflicts, they decided to temporarily abandon the attempt to rescue the "Amethyst" and returned to Shanghai, berthing at the Blue Funnel Wharf. The British "Sunderland" flew from Hong Kong to Shanghai with war medicines yesterday afternoon. At 4:00 PM, it flew from Longhua Airport to the scene of the incident. There were two doctors and some medicines on board. It is reported that there is a square near the Shayao River, near where the "Amethyst" is stranded, which can be used for seaplanes to land. From there, it can be used to rescue the ship.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 21st] The British 10,000-ton cruiser London telegraphed Nanjing today, stating that the ship was also damaged by Communist artillery fire from the north bank while attempting to rescue the British ship Amethyst and has returned to Jiangyin. The London telegram also stated: The Communist artillery fire is fierce and does not allow any ships to approach the Amethyst to rescue the wounded on board.

[Reuters, This City] The British naval authorities here have just announced that the British cruiser London and the destroyer Black Swan returned to Shanghai at 6:00 PM tonight. It has been verified that there are 15 dead and 20 wounded on the London, and 5 wounded and no deaths on the Black Swan. The U.S. Navy is fully assisting in transferring the seriously wounded to the U.S. Naval Hospital here. The Autolycus seaplane, which left Shanghai this afternoon, has landed on the Amethyst with a military doctor and morphine and other medicines, and has taken an officer from the ship back to Shanghai.

[United Press, This City] The British Consulate General issued a statement by Ambassador Steven stating: He did not protest to the CCP, but instructed the British Consulate in Beijing to "inform the highest authorities of the CCP by all possible means about the bombardment of the Amethyst and her sister ship, and request them to immediately instruct the military commanders along the river to stop firing." The statement continued: Steven knew that the Beijing Consulate had received the order, and said that in view of recent developments, "the troops along the river obviously have not received the order to stop the bombardment, so it can be assumed that contact with the Beijing authorities has not been successful so far. Mr. Yuite of the Beijing Embassy has volunteered to try to contact the Communist commander north of Pukou in the hope of obtaining the necessary order to stop the bombardment. Without this order, it is currently impossible to reach the wounded on the Amethyst and provide them with appropriate medical treatment and relief."

[United Press, London, 21st] A British Foreign Office spokesman said today: British ships are authorized by the Chinese government to enter China's inland waterways, just as Chinese warships are authorized by Britain to enter the Thames River. A reporter asked if the Communist authorities knew that the British ship was sailing to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River? The spokesman said: The Communist side knew about this long ago.

[Reuters, Ottawa, 20th] A Canadian Navy headquarters spokesman said today: The Royal Navy has sufficient warships to cope with any incidents in the Nanjing-Shanghai area. He also said: The Canadian destroyer Crescent, which is currently berthed in Hong Kong, is not expected to be involved, as the ship's main task is to protect British nationals in the Hong Kong area, and he does not believe that any Canadian people are at risk from the Yangtze River war.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 21st] The Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Fleet announced here that the gunboat Amethyst, which was bombarded by the Communists and ran aground on the Yangtze River yesterday, resurfaced today and is currently anchored at its original location.

[United Press, Hong Kong, 21st] The British Navy announced here on the 21st that the British destroyer Crescent will go to Shanghai to strengthen the naval strength there, and the heavy cruiser Belfast may also be dispatched.

[United Press, Greenwich, England, 20th] Admiral Fraser, Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy, said today of the British ship bombardment incident: "The most important thing is to think about how to deal with it. Our principle is to leave everything to the local personnel to handle, except for what we can assist, and notify the Foreign Office, the Prime Minister, and the Minister of Defense, and then wait for developments."

Amethyst Floats on its Own

[Reuters, Nanjing, 21st] The British ship Amethyst reported to the British naval authorities here this morning that the ship had managed to float on its own and had sailed three miles downstream from where it was stranded and anchored temporarily.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 21st] A telegram from Dagang said that four rescuers, including two doctors, had boarded the British ship Amethyst to rescue the wounded. At the same time, a plane flew over the ship at 5:30 PM and dropped medicines. Artillery fire started again on this shore, but the ship had sailed upstream to Daluzhen. Those who boarded the ship were Lieutenant Colonel Doolittle, British military attaché, Lieutenant Colonel Cullens, British assistant naval attaché, Paca, a visiting doctor of the U.S. Navy, and another doctor.

Yuite Goes to Communist Area to Negotiate Ceasefire

[Reuters, Nanjing, 21st] Yuite, First Secretary of the British Embassy, has volunteered to cross the Yangtze River from Beijing to Pukou to contact the Communist authorities to stop the shooting so as to rescue the 26 British naval personnel on the Amethyst who have been wounded for 36 hours without medical treatment. Yuite crossed the Yangtze River to Pukou around 6:00 PM on the 21st and went to the Communist area to negotiate. He only carried a toothbrush and 50 silver dollars and planned to enter the Communist line at dawn on the 22nd. He was wearing a naval uniform.

British Officials Express No Opinion

[Reuters, New York, 21st] A New York Times London correspondent said: British officials in London are unwilling to express opinions on the central ship bombardment incident on the Yangtze River before receiving detailed reports. The British Foreign Office declined to issue a statement, only confirming that Ambassador Steven had sent a preliminary report to London. British officials also revealed that since October last year, British ships have been frequently berthed in the Beijing-Shanghai area in order to evacuate British officials and residents if necessary. The Amethyst sailed from Shanghai to Beijing this time on a peaceful mission to transport supplies to the British Embassy in Nanjing. The British side had notified both the Chinese Nationalists and Communists in advance that British ships would undertake such missions in the Yangtze River during the period when British lives and property were at risk from the Chinese civil war.

A Glimpse of British and American Reports and Comments

[United Press, London, 21st] The London Liberal Party News reported on the 21st: The British want to ask why the British ship that was bombarded by the Communists on the 20th was sailing on the Yangtze River at this time, and want to know why our warships were involved in the Communist crossing-the-river offensive. Was it absolutely necessary for the "Amethyst" to go to Nanjing at this time? The Conservative Party's Daily Mail stated: British warships have the right to protect the lives of British people in the Yangtze River. It is gratifying that British sailors retaliated against the shore. Asians should not think that the British flag and everything it represents can be insulted arbitrarily. The British ship's artillery fire has issued a warning to the entire Asia. The Communist Party's Daily Worker stated: Why are British troops stationed in China? It is nothing more than to oppress the corrupt and despicable Chinese government and protect the investment of large enterprises. All British army and navy ships should withdraw from China at this time.

[United Press, New York, 21st] The Vanguard Forum editorial on the 21st stated: The Communist bombardment of the British ship on the Yangtze River will definitely be transformed into an "accident" and will not cause British intervention in the Chinese civil war, just like the United States' non-interference in the Chinese civil war. Therefore, in the short term, unfortunate China can only rely on its own people. If the civil war resumes, it is a tragedy for China and a tragedy for the entire Western world. (More news on page 4)

### The Economic Cooperation Aid to China Program Will Continue to be Implemented, Deciding to Retreat with the Advance of the Communist Army

[United Press, Washington, 21st] The Economic Cooperation Administration announced on the 20th that the Economic Cooperation Program will continue to be implemented despite the resumption of the war in China. However, the General Administration has been clearly ordered by Congress not to assist Communist areas, and its activities will be greatly reduced in areas reached by Communist forces. Congress recently passed a bill extending the aid to China period to February 15 next year, and using the remaining aid to China funds of $54 million for non-Communist areas. The General Administration plans to retreat with the advance of the Communist army, but it will continue to provide goods and carry out rural reconstruction work in China's non-Communist areas and before its economy is exhausted. Within the scope permitted by the military and political situation in Shanghai, the General Administration plans to supply food rice worth $7 million per month until the funds are exhausted. Other items such as cotton, oil, and fertilizers, which have been ordered until June, will also continue to be shipped to China, but aid will be immediately stopped in areas that fall into the hands of the Communist army.

### Whether the United States Recognizes the CCP, Acheson Does Not Want to Comment

[United Press, Washington, 20th] Secretary of State Acheson refused to speculate at a press conference on the 20th whether the United States will recognize the CCP if they win the civil war. A Chinese reporter asked, "If the CCP occupies China, will the United States recognize them?" Acheson reiterated his statement in a letter to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, saying that although the United States has provided $2 billion in aid since the victory, the Chinese military situation has deteriorated rapidly. He said that military assistance accounted for about half of the total.

[United Press, Washington, 20th] Secretary of State Acheson said on the 20th that to his knowledge, there were no American ships berthed in the Yangtze River area where the CCP bombarded the British ship.

### Taiwan Cracks Down on Underground Banks, Seven Seas Trading Company's Criminals and Assets are Confiscated, National Goods Worth NT$80 Billion

[Our Taipei Dispatch of the 21st] Chairman Chen Cheng, in view of the extremely large fluctuations in the financial market in Taiwan in recent days, and according to reports of unscrupulous merchants speculating and manipulating the market, specially ordered a strict crackdown on underground banks on the 20th. After receiving the order, the Police Department sent police to search and arrest the largest underground bank in Taipei, "Seven Seas Trading Company," at 7:30 PM on the 20th.

### No Pedestrians, Shops Closed Tightly, Chongqing Became a Dead City Yesterday, Representatives of 19 Colleges Visited Xu Siping, More Than a Thousand Students Paraded in the Shaci District, Fortunately, Nothing Happened

[Our Chongqing Dispatch of the 21st] Chongqing, a city of millions of residents, has become a dead city today. There are no pedestrians in the morning, shops are closed tightly, the streets are heavily guarded, and the work of various agencies is suspended. Housewives are crying because they cannot buy vegetables and meat. No newspapers have been seen by 9:00 AM. The government police are working as usual. Students from major colleges in Shapingba broke through the cordon and arrived at the Hanyu Highway at 10:00 AM on the 21st. Relevant parties are making final persuasion. Qian Dajun and Liu Yuxi gathered at 10:00 AM to deal with the emergency.

### Government Spokesperson Comments on CCP Terms Continues from page one

(2) The emphasis of the preamble is to confirm that the government should bear full responsibility for undermining the truce agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, for launching the war; to confirm that the government's policies and measures are contrary to the revolutionary stance of the Three Principles of the People and the will of the people nationwide; to confirm that the government and the National Army are already in the position of the defeated; and to confirm that Mao Zedong's "eight basic conditions have been agreed to by the Nanjing Nationalist Government," so the signing of this "Domestic Peace Agreement" is merely a necessary preliminary procedure for the government to fulfill the eight peace conditions.

(3) Regarding the so-called "war criminals" issue in Article 1, the first item of the first clause, which mentions "genuine repentance," "concrete factual performance," "conducive to the advancement of the cause of liberation of the Chinese people," and "conducive to the peaceful resolution of domestic problems," is intended to divide the government internally and entice government civil and military officials to surrender individually. The scope of its "leniency" is limited to those who have proven their loyalty to the Communist Party through concrete facts and surrendered. The second item of the first clause is intended to indicate that all government officials and Kuomintang members who hold firm positions will be regarded as "incorrigibly wicked" and obstructing the advancement of the Communist Party's policies, and will be "severely punished." Moreover, the so-called "cause of liberation of the people" and the so-called "peaceful resolution of domestic problems" have no clear scope, and anyone and any issue can be included.

(4) Regarding the reorganization of the military, the various clauses of Article 4 explain that all armed forces belonging to the government, including the army, navy, air force, military police, local armed forces, military organs, schools, factories, and logistics agencies, should be transformed into the Communist army, while the Communist army is not subject to reorganization. The so-called "based on democratic principles" in points one and two of the second clause of Article 8 both explain that the original "democratic system and organization of the People's Liberation Army," the national reorganization committee, is nominally a committee system, but the Communist members are both directors and hold a majority of the committee members. Whether by order or by vote, our side can only be dominated by them and can hardly argue reasonably or implement its own propositions. The articles repeatedly mention the "areas reached and received by the Communist army" and explain that when the Communist army advances into the areas currently under the government's jurisdiction, the armed forces belonging to the government must not resist. If there are troops that resist and fail to implement the reorganization plan, the government should also assist the Communist army in forcibly implementing it. In other words, the government should order this part of the National Army to join forces with the Communist army to eliminate that part of the National Army. The areas and times that the Communist army wants to reach and receive are entirely determined by the reorganization committee and its branches controlled by the Communist Party, because all military organs belonging to the government (from the Ministry of National Defense to the agencies, schools, factories, and treasuries under the General Logistics Headquarters), all military equipment (military ports, fortresses, air force bases, etc.), and all military materials are included in the Communist army's takeover. Therefore, the Communist army can not only cross the river based on the agreement but also advance to Hainan, Taiwan, and any location under the government's jurisdiction without any restrictions. Many people attach great importance to the issue of the Communist army crossing the river peacefully. In fact, if the government accepts the clause of reorganizing the National Army into the Communist army, crossing the river is not a problem at all. As for the procedures for reorganizing the National Army, Article 8 divides it into two stages: centralized reorganization and regional reorganization. The so-called centralized reorganization means that the reorganization committee controlled by the Communist Party orders the National Army to first peacefully hand over defense areas and warehouses of materials to the Communist army for takeover and then go to locations deemed appropriate by the Communist army to concentrate, so as to be reorganized into the regular troops of the Communist army according to the Communist army's "democratic system" and "regular organization." The navy and air force are also reorganized according to the same principles. Once the reorganization work is completed, the National Army will be completely eliminated.

(5) Regarding the government's tasks after the signing of the peace agreement and the government's future status in the New Political Consultative Conference and the coalition government, Article 8 also has clear provisions. Before the establishment of the coalition government, government agencies can temporarily exercise their functions, and their functions are to handle matters instructed by the Communist Army Military Commission. In reality, they are carrying out orders from the Communist Army Headquarters. The main task is to assist the Communist Army in handling the takeover and handover of various places, in areas not yet reached and taken over by the Communist Army. Governments at all levels should be responsible for maintaining law and order, preserving property, protecting anti-government so-called "people's democratic forces and their activities," and "organizations and activities of peasants gathering in crowds" manipulated by Communist Party members. When the Communist Army's takeover work is completed and the coalition government is established, our government will finally handle its own handover and announce its end. The government needs to wait for the Communist Party to examine the performance of the new government in implementing the "Peace Agreement" and deem it satisfactory before it is responsible for "proposing" to the preparatory committee of the New Political Consultative Conference to allow the government to send so-called "patriotic elements" as representatives. Only after the preparatory committee of the Political Consultative Conference "approves" can the government representatives attend the Political Consultative Conference. This means that the government is not qualified to participate in the preparatory committee of the Political Consultative Conference. Whether the government is qualified to participate in the Political Consultative Conference and who it sends as representatives to participate in the Political Consultative Conference must first be determined after the Communist Party's assessment. The so-called patriotic elements are the figures liked by the Communist Party, and the so-called "reactionary elements" most hated by the Communist Party are absolutely not allowed to be representatives of the Political Consultative Conference. Even if government representatives are allowed to participate in the New Political Consultative Conference, whether the government can participate in the coalition government also needs the Communist Party to "propose" to the New Political Consultative Conference. How many seats the government representatives will occupy in the New Political Consultative Conference and the coalition government in the future must be determined by the Communist Party. Government representatives cannot obtain equal speaking and voting rights in the conference. If the Communist Party is dissatisfied with the performance of the government or the candidates sent by the government, it can revoke the proposal to allow participation in the coalition government at any time. As for the arbitrary and unilateral abolition of the constitution without legal procedures and the destruction of the legal system, it is especially well known to everyone. Summarizing the above points, it can be seen that the signing of the "Domestic Peace Agreement" proposed by the Communist Party is the government's unconditional surrender, the fundamental abandonment of the revolutionary stance of the Three Principles of the People, and the thorough destruction of the constitutional democratic government and all the army, navy, and air forces belonging to the government. From the perspective of the country and the nation, there is even greater danger, placing the whole country under the military control of the Communist army, and any region will become a terrifying zone of military control. The people of the whole country will naturally have absolutely no way to accept it.

Fu Bingchang Arrives in Hong Kong, Transfers to Guangzhou

### Commonwealth Conference Opens Today Attlee Continues to Consult with Various Prime Ministers Seeking Ways to Include India in the Commonwealth Mountbatten in Private Talks with Nehru

[United Press, London, 21st] It was reported on the 21st that Sir Mountbatten will participate in the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference opening at 10 Downing Street on the 22nd. Mountbatten and his wife arrived at London Airport from Malta on the evening of the 21st, ostensibly to attend the naval staff exercise at the Greenwich Royal Naval College. Indian Prime Minister Nehru arrived at London Airport before midnight, where he was greeted by the Indian High Commissioner and others. They then drove to Mountbatten's private residence. The Indian Office announced this morning that Mountbatten had held secret talks with Nehru. Mountbatten has often been referred to as "India's best friend" and is known to have more influence on Nehru than any other Indian politician. The Duke of Windsor, then Prince of Wales, visited India in 1931 and chose Mountbatten to accompany him. Since then, the two have maintained a close relationship. However, he will participate in various informal meetings in an advisory capacity. Meanwhile, with the exception of Canada, which is sending its Foreign Minister as a representative, the prime ministers of the other self-governing dominions are now gathering in London to attend the conference that will determine the future of the British Commonwealth. The prime ministers and their wives will attend a banquet at Buckingham Palace hosted by King George VI today. Sir Mountbatten and his wife will also attend. British Prime Minister Attlee is also hosting the politicians at his official residence and will hold informal talks before the banquet.

[United Press, London, 20th] Prime Minister Attlee began a series of extremely secret meetings with other leaders of the British Commonwealth on the 20th to find a way to keep independent India within the Commonwealth. Attlee has secretly met with Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson, Ceylonese Prime Minister Senanayake, South African Prime Minister Malan, and Australian Prime Minister Chifley. Before the eight Commonwealth leaders begin their secret discussions on world affairs on the 22nd, he plans to meet with Pakistani Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru. When he met individually with the Commonwealth leaders on the 20th, secretaries and other assistants were not allowed to enter Attlee's office. The general assembly of the Commonwealth Conference will be held in a similarly secret manner. No official press releases will be issued on the progress of the conference, at least until after the general assembly closes at the end of next week. Britain insists that every Commonwealth country should recognize the British monarch, although each country can effectively govern its own affairs completely. At the same time, Britain is trying to find a compromise solution so that India does not completely leave the Commonwealth.

[British Information Service, London, 21st] The King and Queen will host the Commonwealth Prime Ministers at Buckingham Palace tomorrow. Queen Mary, Princess Elizabeth, the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester will also attend.

### Whether Soviet Peace Overtures Are Sincere Depends on Future Attitude Western Anti-Blockade Suffocates East German Economy

[United Press, Washington, 20th] A qualified official stated on the 20th that the U.S. government has not yet been able to determine whether the Soviet Union's "peace overtures" in Fubu are sincere or a propaganda tactic. After agreeing with reporters not to disclose his surname and the department he represents, he read a statement, carefully analyzing the noisy "peace" reports. He went on to say that the government does not intend to deny or confirm these messages in order to "avoid public misunderstanding."

[Associated Press, Berlin, 20th] U.S. Military Governor Clay declared today that he had not heard of the Soviet proposal to lift the Berlin blockade. The Soviet side also kept silent, but an official from a small country's consulate claimed to have heard of the statement. The economy of the Soviet-occupied zone is suffocating, and the steel, electrical materials, and precision instruments needed for manufacturing are all subject to an embargo by Western countries. A German railway administrator who recently escaped from the Soviet zone told the West Berlin city government that the East Berlin city government could not maintain itself for more than a month. Railway vehicles are in disrepair, trains are delayed, and locomotives that should be repaired have to work twice as hard. East German police, with Soviet permission, have slightly relaxed border surveillance today, but Berlin Communist police have blocked off most streets. The U.S. military is implementing new tariff controls on U.S. citizens and allied nationals in the occupied zone to prevent smuggling to Austria and Czechoslovakia. According to recent U.S. official estimates, goods smuggled across the West German border amount to approximately 200 million U.S. dollars per year.

Lifting the Blockade Soviet Adds Conditions

[Associated Press, Berlin, 20th] A German official stated today that the Soviet Union intends to propose a plan to the U.S. and Britain to lift the Berlin blockade, but only on the condition that Germany be prohibited from joining the Atlantic Treaty, U.S., British, and French troops withdraw to the banks of the Rhine River, and a German central government be jointly established by the U.S., Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. In addition to lifting the Berlin blockade, the Soviet Union also agrees to withdraw its troops to the banks of the Oder River. U.S. and British authorities neither confirm nor deny this statement.

Germans Eager for Resumption of Trade

[United Press, Berlin, 21st] Heinrich Rau, chairman of the German Economic Commission in the Soviet-occupied zone, suggested today that if Western countries end their anti-blockade against the Soviet-occupied zone, the Soviet Union should lift the Berlin blockade. Rau made the above suggestion in a question-and-answer session with Chang, a reporter for the Communist Party newspaper "Neues Deutschland." He said, "If Western countries lift their ban on trade between the zones, the exchange of goods between the eastern and western zones may resume." He confirmed that German officials from the eastern and western zones had discussed the issue of lifting trade restrictions but said that this was initiated by German officials in the western zone and that the negotiations were held several weeks ago. He also denied that he had told his Economic Commission that the Berlin blockade must be lifted to prevent the economic collapse of the Soviet-occupied zone.

### Germans Should Have Political Self-Determination Rights Unwilling to Be Interfered with by Allied Powers Social Democratic Party Participates in Constitution-Making, Presents Six Conditions

[French News Agency, Hanover, 20th] The Social Democratic Party Congress, meeting here today, refused to agree to any West German constitution unless consideration is given to the six conditions determined by the party to enable Germans to obtain autonomous rights. The congress believes that the six conditions are the "last possibility" for the Social Democratic Party to continue to participate in the Bonn Constituent Assembly. The six conditions are: (1) Germans have the right to self-determination and are free from foreign interference; (2) the "Basic Law" (constitution) should be reduced to the minimum; (3) the powers of the second chamber should be reduced; (4) economic and political unity should be maintained in all aspects, especially in legislation; (5) the financial problem should be resolved so that the parliament can complete its tasks; (6) a single social law should be implemented in all parts of the federation, both domestically and abroad. The temporary constitution drafted by the Social Democratic Party will be announced in a few days after being approved by the party congress. The congress also passed a resolution, recalling that the German parties had reached an agreement on the constitution, but due to foreign interference, the attitude of the Christian Democratic Party has been destroyed. The resolution believes that the intervention of the Allied powers has "endangered the concept of democracy." It also stated that the free expression of the German people's political aspirations, rather than the directives of the Allied powers, can prevent the rise of nationalist or communist forces. The Christian Democratic Party's Ehard, Prime Minister of Bavaria, said tonight that Hanover's decision "is tantamount to an ultimatum" and will increase the internal divisions of the Bonn Constituent Assembly.

### Churchill Urges Unified European Economy to Avoid Becoming Beggars or Slaves

[Reuters, London, 20th] Churchill addressed the European Movement Economic Conference of 21 nations today, reiterating his call for a united Europe. He said that as Europe will have to either sink or swim together, we must think, plan, and strive for the sake of our country and Europe if we do not want to be beggars or slaves. Churchill said that the old system of Europe with twenty-odd countries and its economic units is a stupid system. If Europe attempts to revive in the traditional way, it will never succeed. The evolution caused by the two world wars in 35 years has surpassed the evolution in an average of 100 years. Considering the developments of the late nineteenth century, unless Europe firmly and unifies its economic strength, it will inevitably fall into economic difficulties. We must have currencies that can be freely exchanged as before 1914, and we can go to any place without passports, and there will be no inconvertible money. This seems like a utopian world, but by that time, it will not be surprising. In short, this is the goal we must strive for. Jouhaux, the head of the French General Confederation of Labor, said that the Social and Business Committee of the European Movement should cooperate with the International Labor Organization to prepare for the effective unification of European labor legislation. Jouhaux also advocated collective implementation of important industries and the construction of sluices, tunnels, housing, and atomic power plants to provide homes for the unemployed. The conference is divided into six committees: currency, social and commercial affairs, basic industries, agriculture, overseas territories, and constitutional affairs, which will begin separate discussions on the 21st.

### Paris Peace Conference Passes Resolution Protesting France's Withholding of Passports Black Singer Robeson Elected to Presidium

[United Press Paris 20th] American black singer Paul Robeson said in a speech at the World Congress of Supporters of Peace today that American black people would never fight against the Soviet Union. Mr. Robeson's loud voice broke the monotonous atmosphere of the conference that only criticized the North Atlantic Treaty, the U.S. atomic policy, the Marshall Plan, and Anglo-American capitalist imperialism for the first time. Robeson said, "I bring good news from the American black people, stating that they do not want a war to send them back to a new kind of slave life. We only want to strive for the friendship of the Soviet Union, Eastern democracy, and free China." At this point in Robeson's speech, all 2,000 delegates rose and cheered. Robeson also said that President Truman's colonial development plan would plunge Africans into a new kind of slavery. It is inconceivable that American black people would shed blood for those who have oppressed us for generations, and fight against those who have raised our status in one generation to enjoy the full dignity of mankind. American wealth is created by millions of colonial workers and millions of black people in Eastern Europe. We are now determined to enjoy this wealth.

### Italy's Pre-War African Colonies Should Be Placed Under UN Trusteeship: China Proposes a Plan Similar to the Soviet Union

[United Press Lake Success 20th] China proposed a plan on the 20th to dispose of the former Italian colonies, which is similar to the Soviet plan in some respects. Chinese representative Dr. Wellington Koo said in the UN Political Committee that although many representatives advocated that each relevant territory should be placed under trusteeship by a separate country, there was little agreement on the details. He suggested that the Italian colonies be placed under UN trusteeship, with the exception of a part of East Eritrea. He said that it should be merged into Abyssinia because its residents are of Abyssinian race and culture. Dr. Koo suggested: (1) The United Nations should place Cyrenaica, Tripolitania, and most of Eritrea, Masori Land, and other places under trusteeship. (2) The Trusteeship Council should appoint an administrator for each region and submit it to the General Assembly for consideration, and establish an advisory committee composed of five to seven people to assist the administrator. (3) If the immediate independence of Libya is deemed impractical, the trusteeship of Libya should end after five years, and independence should be granted immediately. Somaliland should become independent after ten years, or in other ways according to the free will of the local residents. The Political Committee has ended the initial discussion on the Italian colonial issue, but there are so many conflicting suggestions on how to dispose of the Italian colonies that it may be difficult to resolve during this session of the General Assembly.

### Secretary-General Chen's Speech: To Cope with the Future Situation, This City is Fully Prepared; There is No Fear of Shortage of Food and Fuel; Meeting Today to Discuss Raising Security Donations

The peace talks have suffered another setback, and the Communist army has threatened to cross the Yangtze River to invade the south.

He said that Shanghai is the economic center of our country, and the government is determined to protect it with all its strength. Now it is fully prepared. If it is invaded, it will strike those who strike. Mr. Chen also stated the various points that have been prepared as follows: (1) In terms of military affairs, Shanghai is now stationed with many elite troops, and the four-effect defense project has been completed, which is enough to protect Greater Shanghai and defend against any invasion. (2) In terms of politics, the government has the greatest determination to maintain the security and order of the city, so that all citizens can share the joys and sorrows and overcome the difficulties together. The military camps that protect Shanghai and maintain security will be given generous treatment so that they can be secure in their work and fulfill their duties. The government will also find ways to enable the general public to maintain their livelihoods. (3) In terms of economy, the daily necessities of the general public will be properly resolved one by one. For example, the most important food and fuel are stored very abundantly and can be continuously supplied by sea, so there is no fear of shortage. In addition, in order to stabilize the lives of the military and police in this city, it is scheduled to convene various trade associations in this city this afternoon to hold a meeting to discuss raising security donations. Because current prices are soaring, it is proposed to increase the security donation from one percent to two percent in order to solve the problem of non-staple food for the military and police, and to achieve the goal of contributing strength and money. Finally, Mr. Chen said that we are still praying for peace, but in case of emergency, we have to make full preparations.

If any conspirators instigate trouble, spread rumors, shake people's hearts, or speculate and manipulate, disrupt finance, strike and slack off, gather crowds for riots, and other behaviors that disrupt security, they will be severely punished and executed on the spot in accordance with the provisions of military-period martial law.

### Labor-Management Assessment Committee to Meet Today: After the Index is Published, the Issue of the Discounted Price of Silver Dollars

[This newspaper's report] This afternoon, the Labor-Management Assessment Committee will hold a meeting to discuss the core issue of how to convert wages according to the price of silver dollars on the day after the cost of living index is published. Because the prices of silver dollars are different in different places, the conversion must be agreed upon by labor and management to avoid disputes. It is possible that one representative each will be sent by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, and the Federation of Trade Unions to jointly agree. The date on which the cost of living index is based should be the average daily, the highest price day, or the day before the cost of living index, which will also be discussed in the Labor-Management Assessment Committee. According to Director Cao of the Social Affairs Bureau, he supports calculating the highest daily price each month. Other issues such as the date of payment of wages and the issue of cash notes will also be discussed at today's meeting.

### The Method of Calculating Wages in Silver Dollars is Not Paying Wages in Silver Dollars

Zhou Xuexiang, Chairman of the Municipal Trade Union Council, issued another statement on the issue of calculating wages in silver dollars as follows: "Due to the soaring prices, the lives of employees who calculate wages according to the cost of living index are severely threatened. In order to thoroughly solve this problem, this association has suggested to the authorities to calculate wages in silver dollars in order to stabilize the lives of employees and maintain production order. Although the discussions from all parties in recent days have gained sympathy, there are still many misunderstandings, such as the acting Mayor Chen said that paying wages in silver dollars is difficult to achieve for a while because the Central Bank is afraid of not having huge amounts of silver dollars. It must be known that what this association proposes is to calculate wages in silver dollars, not to pay wages in silver dollars. A word of mistake makes a big difference. The second item of the resolution of this association on calculating wages in silver dollars clearly stipulates that when factories pay wages to employees, if they do not have silver dollars, they should convert them into gold yuan notes at the market price on the day, and employees shall not refuse. It is sufficient to prove that the method of calculating wages in silver dollars suggested by this association does not involve the issue of the gold yuan note's monetary standard and has nothing to do with the Central Bank's possession of silver dollars. The news report may have some misunderstandings, so I hereby declare the above again."

### Assisting Military Service with Achievements: Xie Dahuang and Others Received Certificates of Merit

### The National Products Manufacturers Association Cables to the Acting President, Requesting the Issuance of Fully Prepared Silver Dollar Notes

The China National Products Manufacturers Association telegraphed to Acting President Li, President He, and Minister of Finance Liu yesterday on the currency system, saying: "It has been found that the gold yuan note has depreciated continuously and has no end in sight, which has led to soaring prices. Although the Central Bank has sold gold, silver, foreign exchange, and materials, it still cannot stop the competition between interest chasing profits and profits chasing interest. In terms of currency, although the gold yuan note is an infinitely legal currency, the actual pricing unit is gold, U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, silver dollars, customs dollars, and public utility base numbers. The gold yuan note has become a subsidiary coin and is inferior to others. Considering human nature, for the sake of value preservation and storage, people mostly go to silver dollars. It can be said that what the people like is silver dollars, and what the people hate is gold yuan notes, which is undoubtedly the case. Under this situation, it is difficult to avoid repeating the mistakes of August 19 last year if we speak lightly about reforming the currency system. However, weighing the situation and considering the reasons, it is imperative to use silver dollars as the unit for calculating wages. At the same time, based on the full preparation of gold, silver, and foreign exchange, issue silver dollar notes for circulation and carrying, and use them together with gold yuan notes as infinitely legal currencies, so that industry and commerce can easily operate, social life can be slightly stabilized, and the mutual competition between interest and profit can be slightly weakened, and the economic crisis can be slightly averted. I hereby submit this by telegram, hoping to hear your instructions."

### The Wounded and Dead Soldiers of the Two British Warships Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday in Two Batches: The Hull of the Arriving Partner Ship Showed No External Damage

[This newspaper's report] Soldiers who were killed and wounded when the British warships Amethyst and Partner were shelled by the Communist army in the Yangtze River arrived in Shanghai in two batches yesterday. In the morning, the Partner brought 10 dead, 15 seriously injured, and 12 slightly injured. In the afternoon, the 5th train on the Beijing-Shanghai line brought one seriously injured and four slightly injured, all of whom were sent to Hongen Hospital on Zhongzheng West Road for treatment. More than 50 uninjured officers and soldiers from the Amethyst also came to Shanghai on the train. They were in a very difficult situation, mostly wearing only undershirts and shorts, and draped in the yellow cotton military uniforms of the National Army soldiers.

The Partner fought with the Communist army's shore artillery for two hours. There was no external damage to the hull, but the interior was in a mess. The Communist army's artillery fire came from 105mm guns, machine guns, and direct-firing guns. According to the personnel on the ship, they returned fire more than 300 rounds and believed that they had destroyed eight Communist army artillery fires and killed about 60 Communist army soldiers. Later, the ship's rangefinder room was destroyed, the engine room was also hit, the steering wheel was damaged, and the helmsman was killed, so they managed to drive to Jiangyin and anchor with great difficulty, and then continued to Shanghai. The ship originally had seven British flags. Unless the Communist army did not recognize the British flag, they would not know that it was a British warship.

The Bodies of the Dead Soldiers Will Be Buried Today

[This newspaper's report] The bodies of the 10 dead soldiers from the Partner who were transported to Shanghai yesterday were sent to the International Funeral Home for embalming and will be buried at Hongqiao Cemetery at 2:30 pm today.

[United Press Shanghai 21st] Fifty-nine soldiers from the stranded British warship Amethyst escaped and arrived here by train this afternoon. According to Officer Hayes, at least 20 sailors were killed on the ship, the captain was seriously injured, and another 34 sailors were injured.

The Shanghai British Naval Authorities Issued a Statement

[British Information Office This City News] The British Naval Authorities stationed in Shanghai issued the following statement at 7:00 pm (21st): The British warship Amethyst reported again by radio last night (20th) at 10:00 pm that the ship's personnel are doing their best to repair the damaged areas so that it can re-float. It is said that 60 of the crew members have left the ship and gone to a large town nearby because they were unable to return to the ship through the mine-laying area at night. Four of them were injured. According to reports, the Communist army continuously fired on the ship with medium-sized artillery fire until noon, and sporadic artillery fire did not stop until the afternoon. As a result, about 17 crew members were killed and about 20 were injured. Therefore, most of the crew members were forced to temporarily leave the ship to avoid greater casualties, but by the evening, those who were able to return to the ship had all returned to the ship. A report was received at 6:15 am this morning that the Amethyst had repaired itself late last night and had now re-floated. It was also reported that the Partner departed from Nanjing at 11:50 am yesterday and drove downstream at full speed until it saw the Amethyst also sending a signal to notify the Partner to turn around and retreat to avoid artillery fire. However, the Partner thought it was safer to continue forward at full speed. After the artillery fire subsided, it was two miles downstream from the Amethyst before turning back to the Amethyst to approach and pull, but it was forced to retreat due to the fierce artillery fire and continued to drive downstream. On the way, it was attacked by active artillery fire from Penzhu Island (Xuewen Island). Most of the casualties of the ship were suffered at this time. The helmsman was killed, and the driving engine could not be used for a while. The crew members died. A total of nine people were killed and three were seriously injured. The ship had effectively fought back with all its weapons. In addition, measures have been taken to send medical aid from Hong Kong by the Royal Air Force Sander Gate seaplane.

Officer of the Amethyst Talks About the Experience

[Reuters This City News] Fifty-nine British sailors and four Chinese cooks from the British warship Amethyst arrived in Shanghai from Changzhou by train at 4:00 pm today. After leaving the ship, they swam to the shore under artillery fire, and then walked seven miles to Changzhou. National Army soldiers tried their best to take care of them along the way. Most of the people who arrived in Shanghai were wearing yellow cloth cotton military uniforms, which were allocated to them by the National Army. Everyone was extremely tired. Some were bandaged, some were carried off the train on stretchers because of injuries, some were barefoot, and some were wearing slippers. They were in a very difficult situation. British and American naval personnel took care of them at the station. After getting off the train, they went to the British Consulate to rest temporarily, and then moved to the British Overseas Chinese residence in Shanghai to stay temporarily. According to Mr. Heath, the leading officer among them, he told reporters that the crew members were ordered to prepare to respond at 8:30 am yesterday. At about 9:00 am, several artillery shells passed by, but did not touch the hull, but the artillery on the shore continued to fire. The helm room and the ship's tower were hit first, and the captain and several others were hit by bullets. The situation was chaotic afterwards, and the hull soon ran aground, and the steering rudder also malfunctioned. At that time, the shore was still firing artillery fire, and the crew members decided that if the Communist personnel tried to board the ship, they would resist with rifles, so they distributed rifles to each member. However, the Amethyst was hit by artillery shells again, and the resistance plan was finally abandoned. Captain Robertson, who had been injured, was hit by a bullet in a corner of the hull and ordered two white flags to be raised. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party seemed to be color blind and continued to fire artillery fire. Then he lowered the ladder, and Heath and his party swam 200 yards to the island. The Communist army still did not let go and swept the water with machine guns, and there were continued deaths and injuries. The Chinese on the island pointed out the path where no landmines were laid. After walking for half an hour, they encountered the National Army firing signal guns, so the Chinese cook on the ship swam to the National Army position on the other side and sent a small boat to pick them up across the river. Led by an officer, they walked seven miles and then changed to three trucks and arrived in Changzhou at 5:00 am this morning. After arriving in Changzhou, a National Army major personally took care of them and contacted the railway bureau to arrange a special train to Shanghai.

### Comforting Officers and Soldiers of the Yongxiang Warship: Representatives Sent Today to Present a Flag

The naval warship Yongxiang has recently been stationed in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, performing river defense duties and guarding against the activities of the Communist forces north of the river. It was once bombarded by Communist artillery, and the ship retaliated with powerful counterattacks, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. A small number of officers and soldiers on board were also injured. The warship has now been recalled to Shanghai for rest, allowing the injured officers and soldiers to recuperate in peace. The Shanghai municipal committee for comforting the troops, recognizing the warship's outstanding contributions in defending the river, has specially requested Committee Member Xu Mingya to represent the committee at 3:00 PM today, to take a "National Hero" banner and some comfort goods to the naval dock to express their respect and comfort to the officers and soldiers on board.

### Socialite Accidentally Kills Adopted Daughter: Corpse-in-Suitcase Case Cracked on Julu Road

Xu Qin Fang Confesses Her Crime After Arrest

[Report from our newspaper] On the morning of the 9th of this month, a discarded yellow old leather suitcase was discovered at the entrance of Lane 556, Julu Road. After the patrolling police brought it back to the Jing'an Temple branch of the Public Security Bureau, an examination revealed a horrifying sight: the corpse of a girl, approximately four years old, covered in bruises. The body was wrapped in cotton, indicating that she had been severely beaten to death before being discarded. The chief of the Fifth Branch reported the case to the Criminal Division of the General Bureau. Division Chief Zheng Tingxian ordered Fifth Section Chief Yao Kai-Ru, Section Officer Wu Liangqian, and Senior Officer Sun Shilin to work with judicial officers from the Jing'an Temple branch to investigate, and the case has now been solved. The perpetrator is a well-known socialite named Xu Qinfang, who was arrested at 6:00 AM yesterday. Following the incident, police officers investigated the scene and determined that

the location of the crime was not far away. Thus, they began a door-to-door household investigation. Soon, Xu Qinfang, the resident of No. 7, Lane 6, Xiangyang North Road, became a prime suspect. Xu's household registration showed two daughters and one maid: one daughter named Wenhua, and the maid, Wang Ma. During the investigation, the girl was not seen, and Xu appeared extremely flustered. However, lacking sufficient evidence, the officers remained calm, but secretly monitored her movements. The following day, Xu left home and did not return, entrusting all household affairs to a female friend. On the third day, Xu went alone to the Wenyong Shou Nunnery on Zhongxing Road in Zhabei to pray for the deceased. Afterwards, she would return home briefly every three to five days, then leave again. By this time, the police had learned from neighbors that the girl had disappeared the night before the incident. Xu's erratic behavior further aroused suspicion. Eventually, they found a way to contact her maid, Wang Ma, and after questioning, she

revealed the truth, bringing the case to light. It was discovered that the deceased girl was actually Xu's adopted daughter, named Wenhua, aged four. When she was adopted (at only one year old), Xu loved her as if she were her own child. However, in recent years, due to financial difficulties, Xu's temperament became volatile, and she often beat the girl. In particular, on the morning of the 6th of this month, the girl had an accident and was severely beaten. On the morning of the 8th, the girl had another accident, leading to another brutal beating, which resulted in her being thrown from the bed, causing fatal injuries. Fearing punishment, Xu placed the body in an old suitcase, wrapped it in cotton, and instructed the maid to take it out and dispose of it in the suburbs late at night. However, halfway there, fearing scrutiny, the maid abandoned the suitcase at the entrance of Lane 556, Julu Road. Upon receiving this information, the police secretly dispatched detectives to watch the house around the clock. At 6:00 AM yesterday, Xu returned and was promptly

arrested and taken to the station, where she confessed everything under interrogation. Xu is thirty years old and a native of Ningbo. In her statement, she recounted her life story, saying that she had received no education in her youth. At the age of fourteen, she followed her father to North China to engage in commerce. At eighteen, she married a wealthy merchant in Tianjin, but they divorced shortly after due to differences. At twenty-four, she came to Shanghai alone and opened a room at the Jinmen Hotel. She once worked as a dance hostess, and later became a socialite, frequenting various social venues, where she met a certain well-known figure in the city. They became intimate and initially rented a house together in Lafayette Terrace on Fuxing Middle Road. Later, she returned to No. 7, Lane 6, Xiangyang North Road. Recently, the well-known figure had lost interest and stopped visiting, causing her financial distress. Deeply frustrated, her temper became volatile, leading to the accidental killing.

### Ancient Tomb Outside the South Gate of Changzhou: First Stage of Excavation uncovers Chamber of Burial Goods

— Our reporter Li Tianhang

[Report from our newspaper, Wujin, 20th] Inadvertently, during construction of fortifications, a certain Yun family in Qinglong Bridge just outside the south gate of our county discovered an ancient tomb. The unusual style of its bricks and the tomb door’s unique construction have caused it to be rumored near and far, and archaeologists from the Beijing-Shanghai area have come to Changzhou to inspect it one after another, all agreeing that it has value in excavation. Following a local recommendation, the county government invited representatives from all sectors to organize an excavation committee. Just as they prepared to excavate, they suddenly received a directive from the Jiangsu Provincial Government stating that according to the regulations on ancient tomb excavations, it should be overseen by an academic institution above the provincial or municipal level, and local authorities should not excavate it arbitrarily. The province then sent a telegram to invite the Shanghai Tongji University and Shanghai Municipal Museum to oversee the matter. Subsequently, Mr. Jiang Dayi of Tongji University, Yang Kuan, Director of the Municipal Museum, Zeng Zhaoyì of the Central Museum and other Shanghai representatives negotiated with local figures, deciding that because the ancient tomb had already been exposed to the surface by the construction of fortifications, the work would be a cleaning and tidying operation, rather than an excavation. Therefore, the excavation committee was renamed the Ancient Ruined Tomb Cleaning and Preservation Committee. The county government appointed known academics such as Jiang Weiyi, experts like Jiang Dayi and Yang Kuan, as well as local figures. Tongji University and the Shanghai Municipal Museum were tasked with submitting the work for registration, field clearing, and academic research. Local authorities would be responsible for maintaining order and providing supplies. It was decided that all excavated cultural relics would be entrusted to the local authorities for safekeeping. With the agreements in place, work gradually began.

As soon as things got underway, trouble arose everywhere. The field workers' location, accommodation, food, and work, all required a lot of preparation and arrangement. Finally, Wang Peiqin, the principal of Qinglong Bridge Elementary School, lent a hand by providing the auditorium as a workspace. The township head, Pin Fuchang, helped by finding workers, borrowing tools, and building fences. The preliminary work was quite a bother.

On the 13th, Mr. Yang Yourun rushed to Qinglong Bridge early in the morning. On the 14th, Jiang Dayi of Tongji University arrived with two technicians, all enthusiastic. The clearing officially began on the 15th. Workers were first employed to remove the accumulated soil in front of the ancient tomb. One hoe, one hoe, one load of mud, one load of mud at a time, on the first day, the foundation of a tomb that had been completely dug out by villagers taking bricks was rediscovered. The length, width, and height were roughly determined. Work was delayed by a spring rain that fell all day on the 17th. On the 18th and 19th, the bottom of the ancient tomb was dug to. Under the loose soil, broken ancient coins and shattered ironware were found. Most of the coins were wuzhu coins, some green with copper rust, some quite complete, some fragmented and difficult to collect. The ironware was also in a decayed state, unlikely to be salvaged. These have now been collected and preserved by the field workers! The area around the ancient tomb has now been enclosed by bamboo fences, and the city defense department has posted a notice prohibiting all visits during the work period. As for the work inside the tomb, as of this writing, it has not yet started and will likely be possible to enter in a day or two.

As the fieldwork unfolded, Jiang Dayi and Mr. Yang Yourun, about five or six zhang to the north of the tomb that was first discovered, that is, directly above the Yun family pier, on the north wall of a deep pit dug out for city defense works, noticed that the bricks were neatly laid. Mr. Jiang and Mr. Yang believed that there was something there, so they assigned one or two workers to excavate there. After digging in only five or six chi, they discovered another pit, full of bottles, large and small, six or seven of which became visible! The objects of the investigation intensified their enthusiasm. Six bottles were taken out, and there were still bottles below, seven, eight, more than ten… until more than ten were excavated on the 19th, continuing until after 2:00 a.m., but there were still many bottles to be excavated. A portion of bronzeware has already been discovered, and for the sake of careful work, it was temporarily stopped, with the area still covered with a board door and sealed with mud. In the early morning of the 20th, a bamboo fence was erected around this area as well, and it was decided that a detailed cleaning would be carried out on the 21st. Mr. Jiang, Mr. Yang, and local figures are all very excited, as another ancient tomb has been discovered.

The ancient tomb pit is completely filled with burial objects. According to the usual practice of Han, Wei, and Jin ancient tombs, there is often a separate chamber for storing utensils. This chamber is undoubtedly a storage room for burial goods. The bricks of the tomb have no patterns, unlike the bricks of the first tomb, which also indicates that these must be two tombs, not from the same family. The burial goods that have been unearthed (before the 20th) are all pottery. The largest one is about one chi five or six cun high and one chi two or three cun wide.

The patterns are extremely beautiful. The upper half is monochrome light yellow oil paint with black brush lines. The mouth of the bottle is decorated with overlapping herringbone patterns, delicate and uniform. A bunch of patterns adorns the neck of the bottle as well. Three lines encircle the bottle’s shoulder and body. In the upper two bands of space, there are patterns of flying birds and harmony. Simple and interesting. The lower half is dark purple in color without oil glaze. There are two rings on the bottle’s shoulder. Tiger hoof feet. Very elaborate. One side of the bottle mouth is broken, full of mud (see picture). The other is a huge shape, about one chi two or three cun high and wide, taking a round shape, most of the upper part is painted with oil glaze, light tea yellow in color. Decorated with overlapping horizontal lines, and vertically with small groups of vertical lines, staggered up and down, the pattern is also simple and lovely. The lower half has no oil glaze, and the color is like mud. This is complete and undamaged, and the inside is all real soil. There are eight or nine other small ones, similar in shape to the big ones, only smaller. There are horizontal lines interspersed with lines on the body. One color is all red, and the other is sauce color. The sizes are also slightly different (see picture). According to informal sources, these kinds of things are generally from the period of the Six Dynasties. The unearthed s have been brought to the county party headquarters, one by one, for safekeeping, to be studied in detail. It seems that there are too few research staff.

The unearthed pottery from the Yun family pier outside Changzhou South Gate: (Top) Approximately one chi five or six cun high, and over one chi wide. (Middle) Approximately five cun high. (Bottom) Approximately one chi high, and over nine cun wide. (Drawn by our reporter Li Tianhang)

### Important Town in Sichuan: Jianyang - The City of Tobacco and Sugar

— Our Correspondent, Zhou Xueduan

[Special Dispatch from Chengdu, 17th of this month] American tobacco is a newly emerging specialty of Sichuan during wartime. Jianyang, the American tobacco capital of Sichuan, is famous throughout the country, rivaling Xuchang in Henan. Jianyang—with Longquan Mountain as its left pillow and the Tuo River as its right belt—boasts flourishing commerce and abundant specialties. It is an important newly emerging city in Sichuan this year. With a gentle spring breeze, I, the reporter, took advantage of a ride to this town, known as the essence of Sichuan's specialties, to see firsthand the current state of production, transportation, and sales of tobacco and sugar specialties.

The Prosperity of Shiqiao in Jianyang is Typical

Jianyang is over two hundred li east of Chengdu. Its waterways are connected to the Tuo River, reaching Jintang to the north and Luxian to the south. Land routes serve as the throat of Chengdu and Chongqing, heading west to Ya'an and east to Wanxian. Leaving Chengdu East Station and crossing Longquan Mountain, you arrive at Shiqiao, the largest town in Jianyang. This is the main water and land terminal in central Sichuan. The exchange of goods between southwestern and northeastern Sichuan takes place here. It is densely populated and the market is prosperous. Education is developed, with twenty-one middle schools and nearly one hundred primary schools. Specialties include American tobacco, sugar, salt, and cotton. The streets in the town are wide and the buildings are neatly arranged. Boats and vehicles are like clouds, and factories stand in rows, creating a scene that is no less impressive than a major county in Jiangnan. Forty li west of Shiqiao is Jianyang City, which is the first important gateway to Chengdu from the east. The Chengdu-Chongqing and Luxi (　) highways intersect. The urban area is magnificent and grand, with numerous new and old factories. The county spans over one hundred square kilometers and has a population of over one million. Half of the residents are tobacco or sugarcane farmers, or workers in sugar factories or salt fields. The rest are mostly tobacco merchants or those involved in the transportation and sale of goods. The reasons for the prosperity of this small town are: firstly, the development of emerging rural industries—such as the export of American tobacco, sugar, and salt; and secondly, convenient transportation. Specialties from northwestern Sichuan, such as tobacco leaves from Jintang and Shifang, and mountain goods from Zhongba and Jiangyou, are all handled here. Its economic position in Sichuan, apart from major ports such as Chengdu, Chongqing, and Wanxian, is arguably second to none.

Production and Sales of the Tobacco Capital

As a special product of Kaiyang, American tobacco has a short history. Although successful trial cultivation has only been around for a few years, its superior varieties and early market appearance (about three months earlier than the rest of the country) have allowed it to catch up and surpass others, selling throughout the country, reaching Beijing and Shanghai in the east, and Guangdong and Guangxi in the south. In total, the county has over 1.4 million mu of tobacco fields, with an annual output of about 160,000 dan. Quality: The leaves are wide, even, and thin, with fine veins, golden color, and a refreshing aroma, making them top-grade among American tobaccos in the country. Cultivation: Seeds are sown in early spring, using bean cake as fertilizer, mixed into the soil of the tobacco fields. After plowing, earthen ridges are built, and then the tobacco seedlings are transplanted. By summer, tobacco plants are formed, and they can be harvested after a short period. Sales: The quality of Jianyang American tobacco is comparable to imported products, with sales extending overseas. Every harvest season, famous cigarette factories in Shanghai and Guangzhou send specialists to Jianyang to purchase tobacco. Local tobacco merchants also have warehouses throughout the country. Transportation to Shanghai and Guangzhou follows the Chengdu-Chongqing highway, transferring to ships in Chongqing to go east. To the northwest, it is transported via the Sichuan-Shaanxi highway to Xi'an and Lanzhou. Within the province, most of the transportation is done by boats and vehicles to various counties. In addition, there are several modern cigarette factories in Jianyang City and Shiqiao. Larger ones have their own drying rooms and nurseries, and manufacture cigarettes by machine. Smaller ones are purely handmade cigarettes. Due to their low cost and excellent quality, sales are very high and demand exceeds supply. Currently, the sales of various brands are limited to the northwestern Sichuan area.

Production and Sales of Sugar, Cotton, and Salt

In addition to American tobacco, Jianyang's specialties also include sugar, salt, and cotton. In Sichuan, Neijiang, Zizhong, and Shiqiao are all renowned for sugar production. Shiqiao alone has 854 sugar houses, and the county has about 200,000 mu of sugarcane fields, with an annual output of over 45 million kilograms, second only to Neijiang and Zizhong. Unfortunately, Jianyang's sugar production is stuck in old-fashioned ways. It is difficult to find a modern sugar factory in Shiqiao. The sugar-making process: The first step is for the sugar houses to press sugarcane into juice and boil it into sugar syrup. The second step is to process and refine it in the "leaking sheds" to produce refined sugar. The process relies entirely on stone mills, iron pots, earthen vats, mud, and pressure, plus the experience of "sugar-boiling masters" to create sugar. This represents three stages of the sugar industry: sugarcane farmers, "leaking sheds," and sugar houses. Limited by old habits and unwilling to change, despite Jianyang's mild climate, progress is still slow. In terms of sales, the sugar is collected in Shiqiao and transported to northern Sichuan, mainly to the northwest, especially the Shaanxi and Gansu areas, which largely rely on Jianyang sugar for supply. In addition, Jianyang's salt has over eighty salt wells in the county, with an annual output of 3.4 million kilograms. However, due to the outdated production methods, the salt quality is not excellent. The production method: "Well households" dig salt wells and extract brine. "Aqueduct households" transport the brine to be boiled. "Stove households" are responsible for manufacturing, boiling the water into salt. This represents three stages of Jianyang salt production. The salt is divided into "flower salt" and "Ba salt." Flower salt is white and granular. Ba salt is black and solidified into blocks. Sales are divided into "wall merchants" and "traveling merchants." Wall merchants specialize in mediation, while traveling merchants transport and sell. Jianyang salt is part of the northern Sichuan salt field and is designated for sale in Chengdu and surrounding provinces. Cotton: The county has about 750,000 mu of cotton fields, with an annual output of over 20 million kilograms, which is transported and sold to southwestern Sichuan.

American tobacco, sugar, salt, and cotton constitute the prosperity of Jianyang and represent the wealth of the Land of Abundance. Here, there are vast green fields of endless tobacco, interspersed with dense sugarcane forests, towering chimneys, and numerous wells and stoves. This place contains boundless wealth and resources. Building Jianyang is the prelude to building Sichuan. After visiting Jianyang, I indeed felt a sense of optimism about the future of Sichuan's development.

### Agricultural and Forestry Undertakings in Guizhou Province: "Facing the Yellow Earth, Back to the Sky" - Strengthening the Development of Ground Production

— Our Correspondent, Liu Mengchi

[Special Dispatch from Guiyang, 17th of this month] The impoverished Guizhou province relies on central government allocations for over 96% of its annual provincial budget. In today's situation of empty national coffers and ever-growing fiscal deficits, not only does the central government find it difficult to bear, but Chairman Gu Zhenglun and the Guizhou provincial people's representative bodies also believe that this is a crisis that will inevitably arrive one day. Under these circumstances, both the central and local governments require Guizhou to quickly strive for economic development, believing that self-reliance through diligence is the only way to overcome the fiscal crisis.

When discussing economic development in Guizhou, whether it be industry or commerce, historical and economic conditions are insufficient, so no matter how much effort is put into "reviving all undertakings," it is definitely impossible to achieve the ideal state of self-sufficiency and surplus exports within three to five years. In the short term, the only economic development undertaking that can "yield results immediately," make up for the difference between provincial fiscal revenue and expenditure, and allow the people to enjoy the fruits of their labor is to develop ground production, in other words, to encourage the eleven million people to further strengthen their "facing the yellow earth, back to the sky" efforts in agricultural and forestry undertakings.

However, given Guizhou's limitations in climate and soil, and the large number of agricultural and forestry projects, undertaking them one by one would be beyond the capacity of the current manpower and financial resources of each county, and would also be limited by the natural environment, ultimately leading to wasted effort. Last year, the Guizhou Provincial Government stipulated that in addition to the production of food crops suitable for universal development in each county, which should be universally carried out by each county, and efforts should be made to adopt methods such as reclaiming wasteland, selecting improved varieties, and paying attention to fertilization in order to achieve self-sufficiency, for crops with economic value, each county should select one or two items that are endowed with unique conditions, suitable for the natural environment, and within the reach of manpower and financial resources, and work together to achieve practical results. In particular, it is hoped that attention will be paid to tung oil, rapeseed oil, and American tobacco, which are commonly planted in the province and yield substantial profits, as the focus of efforts, with the aim of using the production of American tobacco to offset the salt supply from Shanghai, and exporting tung oil and rapeseed oil to exchange for foreign currency, cloth, and other goods.

Regarding the cultivation of American tobacco, since its introduction and promotion in Guizhou, it has achieved results and has become a common cultivation phenomenon in various counties. However, due to the tobacco seeds being introduced for too long, the purity has been lost, resulting in a decline in quality, making it impossible to continue planting. The relevant departments of the provincial government have stipulated that starting from the 38th year, the entire province will universally replace seeds, and the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Politics will massively propagate the Special Character No. 400 tobacco seeds that have been effectively promoted in Guizhou in previous years, and distribute them to each county in a timely and sufficient manner. In addition, with the approval of the Tobacco Production Improvement Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, a large batch of 2,000 city catties of pure Fuguang seeds were transported to Guizhou and distributed to tobacco farmers in each county at a price of one corner of gold yuan per gram for universal replacement. As of now, a total of over 7,900 city catties of Special Character No. 400 tobacco seeds and over 1,450 city catties of Fuguang tobacco seeds have been promoted. More than eight city catties of pure seeds that Dean He Jingzhi used in the United States last year are also continuing to be promoted. According to the estimate of the Provincial Department of Construction, the actual harvest of American tobacco in Guizhou Province in the 37th year is about 500,000 city dan, most of which have been transported and sold outside the province, and the tobacco farmers have made substantial profits. Although the cultivation and production increase of American tobacco in Guizhou Province has achieved great results in recent years, tobacco farmers are not familiar with the technical work of baking, grading, and packaging, and some are even short-sighted and engage in various unethical behaviors, affecting export reputation and causing significant losses to tobacco farmers. Last winter, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Politics established an American Tobacco Technology Training Class, transferring and training agricultural technicians from various counties, providing short-term professional training in American tobacco, with a total of over 90 graduates, who were assigned to continue their work in various counties. The Guangxi Provincial Government also sent seven students to the class for training, and the results were satisfactory. At the same time, the Guizhou Enterprise Company set up collection sites in Guiyang and Guiding, strictly engaged in grading and packaging, etc., to show advocacy and take advantage of the sales reputation. Since its implementation, it has achieved considerable results. The Tobacco Production Improvement Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry also sent personnel to Guizhou last winter to assist due to the vast area of American tobacco cultivation in the province and its great future development. The Guizhou Tobacco Improvement Farm has now been established in Guiyang, and recently a rural supervision group has been jointly formed with the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Politics to go to various counties and districts to actually supervise the sowing and fertilization of American tobacco. Rapeseed is one of Guizhou's economic crops, and rapeseed oil is an important export product of the province. If production can be actively increased and exports can be purchased as much as possible to exchange for foreign exchange, it can not only increase rural income, but also make up for the province's fiscal deficit. Therefore, the Guizhou Provincial Government has designated the promotion of rapeseed as the central task of each county and city, assigning technical personnel to go to each county and township to earnestly guide farmers to use winter fallow land to plant in large quantities without hindering the principle of increasing food crop production. At the same time, it has also formulated assessment methods for increasing rapeseed production in each county and city, in order to strengthen the promotion of this work. During the period when warlords controlled Guizhou, farmers in each county and township were ordered to plant the opium drug that harmed the country and the people in winter. To this day, there are remnants of this poison left everywhere. The provincial government also ordered the anti-smoking supervisors to go to each county and township to supervise the ban on planting and eradication, and at the same time, to urge the county governments to intensify publicity and plant a large number of rapeseed crops that are beneficial to the country and the people. At present, the farmers in each county and township are generally able to abide by this purpose. This is also a wise measure to replace destruction with construction and to drive out bad policies with good policies. According to the report of the Provincial Department of Construction, the total rapeseed production in Guizhou Province in the 37th year is estimated to be over 1.5 million city dan, 19 of which are exported to Guangzhou and Hong Kong. Unfortunately, the past pressing of rapeseed has mostly followed the local method, resulting in Poor oil yield affects exports, which should be improved in order to expand export markets. The Provincial Department of Construction ordered Guizhou Enterprise Company last winter to set up a machine oil pressing factory in Zunyi first to show advocacy and improvement. The new oil pressing machine purchased by the company in Chongqing has now been transported to Zunyi for installation. After the factory building is completed, it can start work by June of this year at the latest.

Most of the vehicles leaving Guiyang to the south are transporting tung oil out of the country, and those who pay attention to the Guiyang market quotations first pay attention to the daily tung oil opening price. The reason is very simple, because tung trees are distributed throughout the province in Guizhou. According to the survey and research of the China Agricultural Research Institute, the tung tree cultivation area in Guizhou Province in the 36th year was about 400,000 city mu, and the tung oil harvest reached more than 260,000 city dan. In recent years, Chairman Gu Zhenglun has always encouraged the people of the province to increase the production of tung oil in this province to exchange for cotton cloth from Hunan and Guangdong, and hopes to plant 50,000 tung trees in the province within three years as the highest ideal, and the speed of production increase can be imagined. The Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute has specially proposed in the work plan that all counties suitable for planting tung trees should adopt the principle of planting tung trees as a means of moving forests. According to the report, the number of tung trees planted in the 37th year in the Wujiang River Basin, a famous tung-producing area in Guizhou, such as Xiuwen, Yanhe, Sinan, and other 12 counties, and other counties suitable for tung trees, is estimated to have reached more than 20,000.

Since its establishment in January of this year, the Guizhou Provincial Products Transportation and Sales Company has mainly focused on tung oil in its exchange and transportation work with Guangdong. More than 1,000 tons have been transported to Guangzhou, and another 500 tons are waiting for the Guangdong Provincial Material Adjustment Committee to resume work before they are loaded and shipped. The 7,000 dan of salt and a large number of telecommunications equipment transported back to Guizhou from Guangdong Province are all injected and exchanged from tung oil trade. The economic value of this is not difficult to estimate.

In addition to American tobacco, rapeseed, and tung oil, which are the most famous economic crops, the climate and soil of the lower reaches of the Hongshui River, Chishui River, Nanpan River, Beipan River, Wujiang River, Jisui River, and Dujiang River in Guizhou Province are all suitable for planting cotton. Since the promotion of planting in the 28th year, the annual output has gradually increased. However, due to the central government's cessation of subsidies last year, the funds were not available, resulting in a failure to substantially improve the promotion policy. The Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute prepared a large number of excellent cotton seeds and massively promoted them in the 38th year. At the same time, it formulated cotton planting precautions and distributed them to each suitable cotton county to widely publicize and urge farmers to plant a large number of cotton in suitable cotton areas in order to gradually achieve self-sufficiency and solve the problem of clothing raw materials in the province. The cotton seeds required by each county are now being prepared by the Shibing Cotton Farm in this province at 10,000 city catties, and 40,000 catties of excellent Xiang-produced De and Tuo cotton seeds are being purchased from Hunan and distributed to suitable cotton counties for promotion, and are now being actively processed. Guizhou's agriculture has a glorious and brilliant future with the unified efforts of all levels. However, due to the 75% self-defense special donation for foreign exports, internal traitors are causing trouble, and they are calling on the rural fools to arm themselves and plant tobacco in the remote areas at any time, so the problem of public security has not yet been ideally resolved, and there are still many difficulties. Recently, due to the convening of the 7th session of the 1st Guizhou Provincial Assembly, some provincial senators secretly weighed the current situation and the current situation in the province, advocating considering whether banning smoking and governing the character are "the first" thing. This is really a major turning point in the future. Because the province's finances are really exhausted, and the central government's assistance is slow, and the security problem is becoming more and more serious. In order to "put out the fire first," Guizhou may have to re-evaluate the anti-drug policy. If so, the agricultural and forestry undertakings in Guizhou may suffer a major setback in the future. This method of drinking poison to quench thirst depends on whether the authorities have the courage to weigh it.

### Full Text of the Kuomintang Statement on the CCP's "Domestic Peace Agreement" - Hoping that the Communist Party will Turn Back from the Brink and Immediately Issue a Ceasefire Order

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 20th] The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang passed a statement on the so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement" of the Chinese Communist Party on the 20th. It is said that it was immediately telegraphed to Acting President Li and President He. The full text is as follows:

Statement of the Chinese Kuomintang on the So-Called "Domestic Peace Agreement" of the Chinese Communist Party

The Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, regarding the eight articles and twenty-four clauses of the "Domestic Peace Agreement" proposed by the Chinese Communist Party, hereby makes the following solemn statement to all compatriots in the country:

1. The damage suffered by our compatriots across the country due to the turmoil caused by the Chinese Communist Party over the past twenty years is actually greater than the damage caused to our country and people by the Japanese invasion, or even greater than that. However, since the government advocated peace, it has endured humiliation and borne heavy burdens, and has not yet discussed the issue of responsibility for the internal turmoil, originally hoping to express sincerity and inspire peace. In fact, after leading the country to complete unification in 1928, we should have devoted ourselves to national construction, which could have been restored long ago. It was only because the CCP constantly launched rebellions, destroying the unification that the people of the country longed for, that the great cause of national construction was obstructed. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, on September 22, 1937, the CCP declared four points to the country: (1) Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are necessary for China today, and the CCP is willing to strive for their thorough realization; (2) Cancel all riot policies and red movement policies that overthrow the Chinese Kuomintang regime, and stop the policy of forcibly confiscating the land of landlords; (3) Abolish the Soviet government, implement civil rights politics, in order to unify the national power; (4) Abolish the name of the Red Army and reorganize it into the National Revolutionary Army, subject to the command of the Military Committee of the National Government. Our party originally hoped that the CCP would repent and jointly devote itself to the War of Resistance and national construction. However, before long, it broke its promise again, harassed everywhere, and repeatedly raised troops. If it were not for the tolerance and magnanimity of our government, the War of Resistance would have been destroyed halfway, and the national lifeline would have been cut off without leaving any residue. After the victory of the War of Resistance, we should have sought the rehabilitation of the people, without remembering old grievances, and first advocated peace, convened the Political Consultative Conference, formulated a peace plan, and convened the National Assembly based on the spirit of the Political Consultative Conference to formulate the Constitution of the Republic of China, seeking domestic peace and unity, in order to implement civil rights advocacy and establish a democratic government. However, the CCP has always insisted on its strategy of seizing power by force. In the past two or three years, it has constantly launched widespread internal turmoil, resulting in countless lives and properties sacrificed by our people in the eight-year War of Resistance. The fruits of victory, the international glorious position, the free life of the people, and the achievements of the national revolution led by the Father of the Nation over the past fifty years have all suffered ruthless losses. All these obvious facts are known to the people of the country. If it were not for the CCP's attempt to blame the responsibility for the civil war on our central government in the preamble of its so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement," our party would have been able to endure all internal and external slanders for the sake of ending the war and seeking peace. However, since the CCP has so distorted the facts, trying to cover up the eyes and ears of the world, our party cannot accept a responsibility that completely violates the truth for the sake of justice, truth, and the history of future generations.

2. The eight articles and twenty-four clauses proposed by the CCP, according to their content, completely lose the nature of agreed peace clauses, but are a cruel punishment and slaughter of the people and government of our Republic of China. The purpose of the CCP's proposal this time is only to establish a one-party dictatorship of the Communist Party, destroying the democratic constitutionalism that our party has been committed to promoting over the years. It has not considered the people's demands for peace and the guarantee of free life and stability, but has only trapped the entire country and people in its iron curtain, following the example of Poland and Czechoslovakia. Therefore, in order to safeguard the independence of the country and the freedom of the people, the CCP should discuss and revise the peace clauses in accordance with the principles proposed in our party's statement on the 18th of this month.

In January of the 35th year of the Republic of China, when the National Government convened a legitimate consultative conference, the CCP stated that before the peace talks were held, both sides must issue a ceasefire order, otherwise it should be regarded as a sign of no sincerity in the peace talks and refuse to participate in the meeting. Before the first gathering of the consultations, a ceasefire order was issued. At this critical moment of peace, our party still hopes that the CCP will turn back from the brink and immediately issue a ceasefire order, so that the nationwide people's eagerly awaited peace talks will not be interrupted, and a comprehensive and permanent peace can be achieved. Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, April 20, 38th year of the Republic of China.

### Touching the Ancients of Three Dynasties, Wearing the Mud of Six Dynasties - Ming Artifacts Unearthed in Changzhou, Jiang Dayi Writes Couplets to Describe Himself

[Our Correspondent, Wujin, 20th] A newly discovered ancient tomb in Yunjia Dun has recently contributed countless archaeological data. See our special report for details. Mr. Jiang Dayi is in a happy mood, and his face is full of smiles in the spring breeze. "Touching the ancients of three dynasties, wearing the mud of six dynasties." This is a couplet he proudly wrote to describe himself. Today, he told the reporter, pointing to the mud stains on his clothes, and said, "Isn't this the mud of the Six Dynasties?" However, he had a very hard night last night.

During the short working process, some professors from Tongji University came together to take many photos. Secretary-General Xu Daolin of the Provincial Government and Commissioner Hu Tieming of the Sui District Administrative Office also visited the tomb.

### Secretary of the Wuxi County Government Watching Free Plays - The Storm Has Eased and is Expected to be Resolved

[Our Correspondent, Wuxi, 20th] Feng Puren, the Chief Secretary and Head of the Social Affairs Section of the county government, and six or seven others went to the Queen Grand Theater in Shuyuan Lane to watch a movie at about 3:00 pm on the 17th of this month. Because the seats were full and the show had been playing for a long time, the gatekeeper Fan Qingshan did not open the door in order to maintain order in the theater. Secretary Feng and others entered the theater from the side door, but the gatekeeper refused, which caused dissatisfaction among Feng and others. In a fit of anger, they hit Fan Qingshan on the head. Afterwards, Ding Heling, the General Affairs Officer of the theater, went to the county government to explain the misunderstanding and apologize, but was detained by Secretary Feng, beaten, and suffered injuries all over his body. At the same time, Fan Qingshan was also detained and tortured in the county, resulting in a great uproar. The theater industry, the trade union, and the workers' union published notices in the local newspapers, pleading with all sectors to uphold justice, and invited the labor community to the park to express their support and demand severe punishment for the culprits, and demanded that Secretary Feng be dismissed and handed over to the judicial authorities for handling. The dispute gradually escalated. Yesterday, Staff Officer Li of the City Defense Department and Police Chief Miao visited the injured Ding Heling and Fan Qingshan at the public hospital. At the same time, the two soldiers who assisted in the crime (county government guards) were sent to the City Defense Department for severe punishment. At present, this storm has eased and is expected to be resolved.

### Five Bandits Arrested in Jiaxing

[Our Correspondent, Jiaxing, 20th] Li Changren, the military training officer of the Self-Defense Squadron stationed in Nanhui Town, led the team to search and suppress Hu Bolong's party on the 16th. Hu's nephew, Hu Yongxiang (alias Lin Chao), was captured, and a letter of appointment was found on him, stating that Lin Chao was appointed as the colonel manager director by Long Longfei (i.e., Hu Bolong), the commander of the Second Brigade of the People's Liberation Army of the Special Commissioner's Office of the Soviet-Zhejiang-Anhui People's Border Area Government of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou District. A number of bullets and a diary were also found, recording the salary and rice paid to Bu Songsheng (the current deputy mayor of Changxing Town and the former secretary of the Kuomintang District Party Department), Chu Jiliang, Ji Mingying, Wang Daming, and others. All the criminals were arrested separately and interrogated by Deputy Commander Lang of the General Team. Bu and others confessed that they were all responsible for intelligence and other work. The five criminals have now been transferred to the County Military Law Office for interrogation. In addition, the Nanhui Police Station arrested a suspected bandit, Ji Hongrong, who has now been sent to the General Bureau for handling.

### Market Stroll

— Mr. Jun He Ke

Terror and Tension Reach Extremes; Markets Jump Uncontrollably

Yesterday's market development was marked by an atmosphere of extreme terror, reflecting the current situation and the anxieties of the people.

The demand for "survival" has pushed rice, flour, and coal briquettes to unprecedented heights.

Gold prices have surged at an unparalleled rate, and silver dollars are also rising rapidly and fiercely. Strangely, the US dollar remains sluggish, while securities have even hit a limit up, which is truly incredible.

The situation, as the authorities say, has indeed become clear. The market fluctuations have also become clear from now on. The first things that people are concerned about are food and fuel. White rice is already selling for three million per door.

The social bureau issued an order in the market to limit prices, but like a wildfire, prices soared to double the limit in just a few minutes.

Isn't that right? To defend Shanghai to the death, asphalt roads and cement courtyards cannot produce food. In order to cooperate with the defense of Shanghai to the death, all citizens should step up hoarding rice and storing food. Therefore, now is not the time for price limits, but rather for allowing prices to rise wildly.

In fact, whether there are price limits or not, the rice market is already in a process of wild price increases, actively developing.

Following the sharp rise in rice, oil and flour are also working hard to catch up.

Cotton cloth and silk are also jumping wildly. The facts could not be clearer.

If the situation continues to develop, the time to stop and shut down machines is approaching. Moreover, the wage issue has now entered a new stage, and there is no room for hesitation on either side.

The wage burden is rising wildly in response to the price of grain and silver dollars. The price of manufactured cotton cloth will naturally leap forward at an even more rapid pace.

Especially silk; just imagine that the spring cocoons are about to hit the market. If the situation changes, there is a risk that this year's cocoons will be completely wasted. Without cocoons, there is no silk. The current small stock of silk naturally has special reasons to command high prices.

The sources of coal, wood, and firewood need not be mentioned.

Petroleum, which was lagging behind in the past, will also advance rapidly from now on.

Interestingly, export specialties such as tea, tung oil, and bristles have also risen sharply.

However, there are also some markets that have grasped the consequences of a major change in the overall situation, and have shown foresight. For example, industrial raw materials such as fuel and pigments, although they are also rising, are only rising, and are far behind the leaps and bounds of other markets.

However, their temporary compromise will not be a problem for them to overtake later.

Gold, US dollars, and silver dollars will undoubtedly become the darlings of the future.

Silver dollars have real sales, and gold dollars are easy to carry.

Future developments will unexpectedly reflect on the US dollar.

Yesterday's foreign exchange transfer certificates rose by more than double alone, which shows that a lot of funds are fleeing in large quantities. The main stream of the flight is foreign merchants. If the Central Bank does not quickly guard against this, it will be too disadvantageous to let this large source of foreign exchange be cheaply given to others.

### Militia from Qidong Flee by Sea

[Report from this newspaper] According to refugees from Qidong who recently arrived in Shanghai, after Qidong fell into communist hands, all the grain stored by the people was requisitioned by the communist soldiers, and the people were forced to subsist on sweet potatoes. Recently, in response to the CCP's crossing of the Yangtze River, the local communist authorities dispatched cadres to the countryside to promote conscription. Militiamen in areas from Nanyang Village to various joint towns were unwilling to leave their homes and rose up in resistance. The communist cadres were caught off guard and many were killed. Fearing retaliation from the communist forces, the militiamen, along with their families, used wooden cabinets as boats and fled by sea.

### Poppy Eradication in Wangcang County, Northern Sichuan

[Report from this newspaper in Chongqing, 20th] Wang Lingji telegraphed the Commander-in-Chief's Office on the 20th, stating that in the six townships of Yingcui, Dadao, Wucao, Kuancheng, Fuqing, and Guohua in Wangcang County, Northern Sichuan, all mountainous areas except for those along transportation lines were planted with poppy seedlings. The township chiefs, Yu Shiyi and He Shulin, colluded with unscrupulous gentry to protect the planting and transportation. He secretly dispatched County Magistrate Li Jimin to personally lead troops to eradicate the poppies. Yu and He have fled to the border between Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, and are currently being pursued. Their land has been confiscated to subsidize defense expenses.

### News in Brief

Jiangyin

[Report from this newspaper] Tan Bingkun, a native of western Jiangyin County, has committed numerous crimes. After being detained, he escaped from prison during a heavy rain last autumn. He was recently arrested in Wujin by the city defense department during a household registration check and will be returned to Jiangyin for trial soon.

Songjiang

[Report from this newspaper] This county was originally a rice-producing area, and straw was used for fuel, so there was no shortage. However, various military units individually went to the countryside to requisition straw, without unified allocation by cooperative stations. As a result, there is a shortage of fuel for the people, and the price of straw has risen to 100,000 yuan per city dan. Furthermore, some vagrant soldiers and lawless outsiders collude together, buying straw from the villages at a very low price (less than 3 or 4 percent of the market price) and selling it in the city at a high price. The straw in the countryside has been depleted, and there is a risk of food shortages for the people. Therefore, some people have petitioned the authorities to take effective and forceful measures to ban this practice.

Pinghu

[Report from this newspaper] Starting on the 19th, all teachers and staff of the Provincial Jiaxing Normal School took two days of leave to support the provincial secondary schools' efforts to seek reasonable treatment from the Department of Education. They also sent representatives to Hangzhou to take unified action with other schools. Xia Ding and another person were sent as representatives of the school, departing on the 2nd.

Social Services Reader Consultations Legal Clarifications

### Marriage Engagements Made by Parents in Childhood Can Be Deemed Invalid by the Individuals Involved (Answered by Lawyer Tang Mingshi)

Question from Huang Zihe

(1) Are marriage engagements made by parents through matchmakers when the individuals involved were underage and did not know the details valid? (2) If someone was forced to marry due to a lack of self-sufficiency as a minor and already has children, can they still deny the marriage engagement? (3) Under what circumstances can grounds for divorce be established? (4) If an old-fashioned, unreasonable marriage is declared dissolved, is alimony required?

[Answer] (1) Marriage engagements made by parents are not necessarily considered invalid, but if the individual involved was a minor at the time of the engagement and lacked capacity, they must express their disagreement in a timely manner upon reaching adulthood. (2) Once married, the law considers the individual to have capacity, and the act of marriage is considered an expression of agreement. (3) Divorce requires grounds for divorce. Article 1052 of the current laws of our country stipulates various situations, and these are the only circumstances that qualify. If both parties agree, a divorce by agreement is also possible. (4) In a divorce, the party without fault has the right to demand compensation from the other party, whether the marriage is old-fashioned or modern.

Globus Newspaper Boston Reader Seeking Chinese Friend

To Whom It May Concern: Mr. Aefeo Ever, a reader of this newspaper in Boston, sent a letter in April, requesting assistance in finding his Chinese friend, Guo Pingfang (or Fang Guoping). This gentleman once studied at Northeastern University and previously resided on Shigaota Road in Shanghai. He may now be engaged in the jewelry import and export business. His cousin once worked as a sports instructor somewhere in Shanghai. We would like to use a corner of your newspaper to help locate him. We would be grateful for your assistance! Sincerely, Globus Newspaper Agency.

### Seeking Sun Guiying

To Whom It May Concern: My younger cousin, Sun Guiying, also known as Xiao Gang, is twenty years old and a native of Xinghua, Northern Jiangsu. She is short, with a round, dark face, two gold teeth (front teeth), and two small braids. She was wearing a short jacket with a yellow background and red stripes, black trousers, and red shoes. She speaks with a Jiangbei accent. She has an elderly father at home. Due to being unable to endure abuse from her stepmother, she came to Shanghai for the first time in March and worked as a maid at Zhang's residence at 11 Fuyin Village, Xiaoshadu Road. On April 15th, she accompanied her aunt to the Yumin Egg Store on Madang Road and got lost on the way back. Because she is young and ignorant, unfamiliar with the area, and could not remember the address of Zhang's residence, she has not returned for five days. We are extremely worried! Kind-hearted people, if you know her whereabouts, please send my cousin back or inform us so that our family can be reunited. We will be eternally grateful and never forget your kindness. I have always admired your newspaper's tireless efforts in serving society and hope you can publish this letter to help us find her and reunite our family. I am deeply grateful. Sun Huayuan, April 21st. (Contact at Liu's residence, 1 Xinkang Garden, Fuxing Middle Road)

### Rice Limited to 1.7 Million per Stone Yesterday, Trading Halted in North Market, Cooking Oil, Flour, and Grains All Up Over 50%

The rice market has been experiencing a sharp rise due to the easing of credit and surging international prices. In the South Market, white polished rice initially opened at 1.7 million yuan, then rose to 1.85 million yuan, and today's spot price is 2.2 million yuan. Early indica rice spot price is 1.9 million, and dry land rice is 1.8 million, with a futures price of 2.16 million today. At 10:30 AM, the Social Affairs Bureau ordered the trading price to be limited to 1.7 million yuan, but it was difficult to contain the rise due to the soaring gold price. The market closed higher again. Due to the 1.7 million limit in the North Market, trading could not be conducted, and the market was halted. In the afternoon, the retail price of white polished rice was as high as 2.8 million yuan.

Cooking Oil

The price surge has been raging like wildfire. With credit suddenly loosening, all commodities are racing forward. The oil price jump is even more violent. Soybean oil opened at 15 million yuan, and rapeseed oil peaked at 12.5 million yuan. However, due to the excessive rise, it slightly retreated by 2 million yuan. Soybean oil closed at 13 million yuan, and rapeseed oil closed at 11.5 million yuan. Peanut oil closed at 13 million yuan. Each rose a staggering 70%. Soybean cake is in short supply, skyrocketing by 70-80%.

### Baseball Begins Two-Week Postponement, Sino-American Strong Teams Will Have a Friendly Match Tomorrow First

[Report from this newspaper] The Racetrack Softball League, originally scheduled to open on May 1st, has now been resolved by the organizers to postpone it for two weeks, and it will begin on May 16th (Monday).

There are already twenty participating teams. The organizers, according to the strength of each team, and in imitation of the World Professional Baseball method, divided them into Group A and Group B to compete. The Panda, Xiqinghong, US Air Force and other eight teams are in Group A; the remaining twelve teams are in Group B.

The games will be held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons, with no games on weekends. The venue is inside the racetrack, but if each team can provide transportation for the opposing team's players and obtain the other team's consent, they may request that the game be held at another venue. The sports equipment needed for the game will be provided by the US Navy Sports Department to lend to each team.

According to the person in charge of the league, after the league was announced to open on May 1st last week, they received letters, telegrams, and verbal protests from all parties, all of which considered the start of the softball season to be too early. Except for the US military, other Chinese and foreign teams were mostly unable to concentrate on training due to the fact that the basketball, football, and track and field seasons had not officially ended, which would inevitably affect the strength of each team. After several meetings and consultations, it was decided to postpone it by half a month. The league will be held twice this season. The one that starts on May 16th is the first, adopting a single round-robin system. It is expected to end at the end of June. The second league will begin in early July, and will be changed to a double round-robin system.

The list of teams in each group of the league is as follows:

Group A

Panda, Sheraton, Dichzhenge (warship), St. Ride A, Texaco A, Country Club, Xiqinghong, Aviation.

Group B

Tiyun, Military Officer, Texaco B, Dragon Tiger, Meteorology, St. Ride B, Portuguese Merchant A, Portuguese Merchant B, Red Star, Wild Duck, Tiger Team, Xiqinglan

In addition, the Racetrack Authority believes that the only formal ball game competition with a significant scale is rugby, and the rugby season ended at the end of February. Softball practice began in early April. In order to facilitate the practice of each team and provide a reference for beginners, the authorities intend to do their best to arrange friendly exhibition matches before the league begins. Tomorrow (23rd) may be a good show, with the strongest teams from China and the United States competing. On the Chinese side, the Panda will be led by the 19th, and the US military will be represented by the Sheraton warship. (For time and location, please pay attention to tomorrow's newspaper).

### Mayor's Cup Basketball Tournament: Dagong and Huili Advance; Women's Group: Ying Team Wins Narrowly Over John

[Our Newspaper Report] The Mayor's Cup basketball night featured three matches. Due to exams at Hujiang University, the Ying team (composed of female students from Hujiang University) started at 6:00 PM. Over 2,000 fans were enthusiastic. (1) Huili defeated Maoxun 41-23, with a halftime score of 23-15. (2) The women's Ying team defeated John 32-25, with a halftime score of 15-10. (3) The Dagong team defeated the Pu team 82-47, with a halftime score of 37-22. The winners advance to the second week of the tournament.

Maoxun started strong but faded later. Initially, they surprisingly led Dafei Huang 11-3. Huili dared not slack off, and Cao Zhiji and Wei Xu entered the game, leading to a turnaround. Their AB team combined forces, creating a formidable presence. In the showdown between the two university women's teams, Yang Shujun of the Ying team showcased her skills. However, at the beginning of the third quarter, the score was recorded at 17-16, and they were almost overtaken by John. John was not as fast-paced as their opponents.

In the final match, the Dagong team performed to their fullest. The Pu team seemed fragmented at the beginning, appearing vulnerable. Due to Dagong's excessive emphasis on performance, the Pu team managed to struggle somewhat. Cai Wenhua's entry in the second half was well-received by the audience. Wenhua, Zhongqiang, and Boling scored the most points.

### Huili Defeats Maoxun

The first match, Huili versus Maoxun, began at 6:00 PM. The five players for Huili were Shang Chongyu, Chen Zhengmiao, Yu Dinghou, Bai Baokang, and Shang Chongling. The opposing team consisted of Wang Rongsen, Sun Jiashuang, Zhuo Guanzheng, Zhu Jianxiong, and Chen Hongyi. Gongsen took the lead, but Huili's Chong and Dinghou scored three consecutive points. Unexpectedly, Maoxun displayed great power, briefly leading 5-3, and then called a timeout to strategize. Huili replaced Lu with Shu Yuan, and Maoxun's Jiawen played aggressively, quickly making it 11-3. Chen Kan replaced Jianxiong, and Chongyu began to "respond" slightly, gradually showing vitality. At 15-10, Zhiji and Wei Xu simultaneously "went into the water" replacing Baokang and Shu Yuan. The old generals' tactics were indeed effective, and the cooperation between Cao and Chongling resulted in a 15-15 tie. Wei scored on a free throw to take the lead, and Zhengmiao "added fuel to the fire." Huili scored thirteen points in one go. Maoxun went from active to passive, and at halftime, Huili led 22-15, turning the tide.

In the second half, both teams made significant changes to their lineups. Maoxun's players were Chen Kan, Songyi, Gangzhen, Zhaocheng, and Hongyi, while Huili also rotated players. The Shang brothers, Zhengmiao, Shuyuan, and Baokang kept the game balanced. Maoxun's attacking movements seemed slower, and their short-range passes were too strong, making it difficult for their teammates to catch them. Huili's Fuhai came on as a substitute for Shuyuan. At the end of the match, Huili won 41-23, advancing to the next round.

### Ying Team Defeats John

The women's teams from John and Hujiang (Ying Team) took the field, "refreshing the eyes" of the audience. For five minutes, everyone was chasing and running, and because they lacked experience playing men's rules, every time they dribbled the ball, they seemed startled. Wang Shan of the Ying team missed three free throws, but Huang Pinzhen and Yang Shujun successively scored six points. Yang's "braking" was quite good, but John seemed unable to run. Zhang Luoluo repeatedly attempted shots but missed. Wei Meijin pulled through, and Han Yun scored again. In the first quarter, the Ying Team took a 6-4 lead by two points. Lin Jingyi's score brought the score to a 6-6 tie at the beginning of the second quarter, then 8-8. Jingyi's free throw put John ahead by one point. In the university league, the two teams were evenly matched champions. Today, these rivals met on a narrow path, becoming particularly fierce. Yang Shujun of the Ying team demonstrated extraordinary talent and potential. Wang Shan scored a basket, making the halftime score 15-10.

Judging from the posture of several players on the Ying team, outsiders speculated that there might be students from the Municipal Sports Academy "integrated within." At the beginning of the third quarter, the score was 17-16, with John only half a point behind. However, joy turned to sorrow, and the Ying team became rampant again, scoring eight points in an instant. At the end of the quarter, the score was 25-18. In the final quarter, John made frequent adjustments, still attempting a desperate move. Han's momentum was fierce, bringing the score to 26-23. Yao Huijuan was penalized for her fifth foul and sent off, and Meijin filled her place. The active members of the Ying team were all "sleeves damp with sweat," ultimately defeating John 32-25.

### Tonight's Table Tennis Group A Competition: Hualian Takes on Bank of China; Bank of China Defeated Post Office B by 3-2 the Night Before Last

In the fourth session of the Table Tennis League, the night before last, Group A's Post Office B faced Bank of China at the Postal Affairs Table Tennis Room. Bank of China had suffered a crushing defeat to the Post Office before. Since then, when facing the Post Office team again, everyone fought desperately, putting in their utmost effort. As expected, with determination, they finally relied on the valiant resistance of Gao Zhonglin, Zhu Yongkang, and Zhu Guozhen to achieve the final victory. Post Office B unwisely abandoned the steady stroke of Shen Airen, replacing him with the chopper Gu Hehua as the lead-off, a poor strategy. The erroneous arrangement of the five-game list allowed Bank of China the opportunity to win. Gu Hehua happened to face Gao Zhonglin, also a defensive player. Gu could not bear it and changed his strategy, switching from chopping to stroking, repeatedly touching the net and losing two straight games. The other third and fourth games were extremely intense. Veteran Zhu Yongkang of Bank of China was narrowly troubled by Zheng Yongquan, the chopper from Post Office B, in an extremely close score, but ultimately remained calm and forced back Yongquan, a victory snatched from danger. After Dai's loss, the full burden fell on the shoulders of team captain Zhu Zhongsun. Zhu's psychological tension led to an abnormal performance. Zhu Guozhen, the stroker from Bank of China, became increasingly brave, winning two straight games after losing the first, laying the foundation for Bank of China's victory. As a result, Bank of China defeated Post Office B by 3-2, which can be considered fortunate. The records of both teams and the results of each game in Group B are recorded below:

Group B Results

Agricultural Machinery won Guansheng (B3) 5-0

Lingyun won Er Ma (B1) 5-0

Post Office 3 won Star (B3) 4-1

America Asia won New Asia (B3) 4-1

Post Office 4 won Shu Ping (B1) 3-2

Lingyun won Textile 4 (B1) 5-0

Tonight (the 22nd), starting at 7:00 PM, there will be one more Group A game and five Group B games. In Group A, the strong Hualian team will face Bank of China. The latter, riding the momentum of victory over Post Office B, will fight Hualian again tonight, with the entire team displaying vigorous spirit and redoubled energy. Hualian is known as one of the top five teams in Shanghai, with its strong reputation spreading far and wide to the capital. Its roster includes versatile players such as Zhang Zhihong, who qualified as a Chinese team member in international competitions ten years ago, and stroker Deng Xiurong, who was selected as a representative of the Shanghai United Team and defeated Ma Hanrong, a champion from the Hong Kong Confucian Society, bringing glory to Shanghai. Others, such as chopper Li Zhen and stroker Lu Wenliang, are also experienced players. All eight players on the team are Cantonese athletes, but tonight is their first time on the field, so their condition is uncertain. It is expected that the two teams will meet in full force, with upper-level coordination, and will definitely threaten Hualian. The competition will take place at the Hualian Table Tennis Room, No. 194 Nanjing East Road. The venue has been repaired and arranged to be very spacious, accommodating up to a thousand spectators. There will be no tickets sold. The organizers welcome guests of the opening ceremony to come and watch the game to express their gratitude for their previous efforts. The order of each game tonight is recorded below:

Hualian vs. Bank of China (Group A) 7:00 PM Hualian

China Merchants vs. Fansheng (Group B2) 7:00 PM Jinmen

### Dagong Defeats Pu Team

The starting five for Dagong were Cunzhong, Wenlong, Zhongzhang, Zhan Chen, and Boling. The Pu team consisted of Lin Yongsheng, Tian Zhaoqi, Chen Song, Huang Wencheng, and Wang Kai. Boling scored the first point, and Zhaoqi of the Pu team also scored. Dagong's Huang and Zhong threw left and right, easily making it 10-3. Cunzhong broke his nose, and Gengsheng came on as a substitute. At halftime, the score was 37-22.

In the second half, Wenhua and Wenlong replaced Boling and Gengsheng. Wenlong remained calm and composed, scoring baskets with ease. The Pu team fought hard but could not resist. Zhaoqi and Wencheng's shots also did not "rebound," but the score was still about twenty points apart. At 64-45, Boling was replaced by Zhan Chen. Zhan, due to a stomachache after dinner, lamented his condition, not yet recovered, and unable to exert himself. Resting and waiting, he did not score last night. Tu Wenlong then roamed freely for a while, ultimately winning 82-47.

### Table Tennis Knowledge (13)

X. The Art of Serving

Serving is the beginning of the battle.

When serving, first hold the ball with the thumb, index finger, and middle finger of the hand that does not hold the racket. Raise the ball about three or four inches above the table surface, then make the racket perform a 75-degree bow and strike downward on the ball. When serving, first release the ball, then strike the ball with the racket onto the table, and then from your own table surface into the opponent's table surface.

When serving, the server should stand outside the end of the table, and both hands should be slightly behind the table when serving.

Lin Sheng's Note: This year's Table Tennis League adopts the International Table Tennis Federation's rules, so serving should be done according to the above serving method.

The served ball must bounce once on your own table surface before passing over the net and landing on the opponent's table surface. If the ball does not bounce once on your own table surface first, but is directly hit onto the opponent's table, or bounces off something on the side, etc., these are all illegal and are considered "lost ball" according to the rules.

When serving, being too far away from the table will be exploited by the opponent. But when learning, it is difficult to serve far away from the table, so you can only stand close to the end of the table. After practicing, you can gradually increase the distance from the table.

The strength of the serve depends entirely on the striking force of the racket. If the striking force is heavy, then the power is strong and the ball goes far. If the striking force is light, then the power is weak and the ball is light.

Some people often look at the opponent's standing position and use the serve to gain victory. For example, if the opponent is far away from the table, then serve lightly, so that the ball's bounce is small and it lands near the net on the opponent's side. The opponent will often be unable to move forward to return the shot. If the opponent is very close to the table, serve with force, so that the ball's bounce is strong, crossing the net and reaching the opponent's far end quickly and high, trapping the opponent in a situation where they cannot retreat. However, if this shot is too light, it is easy to hit the net. If it is too heavy, it is easy to go out of bounds. Therefore, without considerable experience, it cannot be easily attempted. Furthermore, it is difficult to compare each person's true ability when winning in this way, so some table tennis players are unwilling to adopt this strategy.

Serving postures are also very different. Some put their bodies far back, with both hands completely in front of the body. Others put the hand holding the ball in front of the body and pull the hand holding the racket behind the body before moving it forward. The latter method is easier to use than the former.

When practicing returning the ball, at the moment the ball leaves the opponent, you must calmly prepare to receive the ball. Because when preparing, raising your spirit naturally gives strength to your wrist and tightly grips the racket. The returned ball must cross the net or go around the net post to reach the opponent's area.

XI. The Art of Defending

What is blocking? What is chopping? How is a brush shot played? What is a lob shot?

Some people advocate that when playing table tennis, you only need to be bold and just hit the ball, without necessarily learning this first and then learning that. In fact, although this method of learning may produce one or two good shots, it is an accidental coincidence and there is no guarantee. When playing table tennis, you must first learn to defend, and competitions should be the same. An experienced table tennis player often uses retreat as a way to advance, patiently defending first to explore the opponent's weaknesses, and then deciding on the strategy for attack.

Skillfully using defensive techniques, both left and right, can often tire the opponent out and prevent them from having the opportunity to attack fiercely.

There are many ways to defend: "blocking" is defending, "slowing down" is defending, and "brushing" is also defending. When practicing, patiently defending allows you to hit the ball many times and get more opportunities to practice. When competing, patiently defending allows you to avoid losing. Sometimes, you may also return the shot appropriately and get the opportunity to win.

First, we will discuss the methods of defending in detail:

### The Story of Man

— Hong Qi

When God created the donkey, He said to it, "I give you twenty years of life. Are you satisfied with this number?"

"Ah! Dear Father in Heaven, please have mercy on me. If I live in this world for twenty years, I will always have to carry extremely heavy things, people will ride on my back, and the whip will always fall on my back like raindrops." Twenty years is too long! Because of the donkey's plea, the merciful God agreed to reduce it by half.

The second creature God created was the dog. He gave the dog twenty years of life. But the dog cried and barked,

"How can I live so long? I will become old and useless," and eventually be kicked out the door to freeze and starve. "God, half the days are enough." The merciful God again granted the dog's request.

Then God created the monkey, giving it twenty-five years of life, and telling the monkey that it did not need to work and had no worries. But it would be born very ugly, and everyone would make fun of it. As a result, the monkey said it did not want to live so long, and ten years of life was enough. God agreed.

Finally, God created the most intelligent of all creatures—man. He specially gave him thirty-five years of life, fully expecting the same phenomenon of rejection. Unexpectedly, the opposite happened.

Man said in a dissatisfied tone, "Dear God! Thirty-five years is such a short time. I just got comfortable, married a wife, and had children, but I'm going to die!" So, God agreed to give him the ten years that were left over from the donkey, but he was still not satisfied. As a result, God also gave man the twenty-five years that were left over from the dog and the monkey.

So, man began to live happily and painlessly. He ate, drank, played...and lived like this for thirty-five years. In the next ten years, man worked like a donkey, increasing his wealth. In the following ten years, man guarded his property like a dog, often getting angry and unable to sleep at night. In the next fifteen years, man was made fun of like a monkey and slowly became old and ugly. This is the life that man himself requested when God created him. Only after seventy years of age did he quietly die.

### Random Thoughts on Chopsticks

— Chen Zuogao

I recently attended a banquet hosted by a friend from Fujian and saw ten pairs of lacquer chopsticks made by Shen Shao'an of Fujian. They were green like apples and coated with a very thick layer of gold mud, painted with plum blossoms, orchids, bamboo, and chrysanthemums, each flower with a different color. The craftsmanship was exquisite. (It is said that these are old heirlooms, with excellent color and quality, completely different from the counterfeit goods sold at sea today.) It makes one think that in the peaceful days of the past, in addition to fine clothes and delicacies, people would make this "lacquer chopsticks and jade plate" as an embellishment, simply for "pleasure and enjoyment." But in these days of poverty and hardship for the people, even those who have the means are concerned about the difficulties of the times. How can they bear to use lacquer chopsticks and a jade plate alone? However, the widespread and long-standing use of chopsticks in our country is something that can be discussed.

Chopsticks were commonly referred to as zhu in ancient times, or zhu, or jia. They were made of various materials, such as gold lacquer, ivory, bamboo, or wood. Details can be found in the classics, histories, and various notebooks. Chopsticks were referred to as zhu, as in the "Historical Records: The House of Song Weizi," "Tao began to use ivory chopsticks." "Explanation of Names: Li Shizhen said, 'Ancient chopsticks were made of bamboo, but in recent times, people also use various woods and ivory to make them.'" "Book of Han: Biography of Zhang Liang," "Your minister asks to borrow chopsticks to wish him well." Zhang Yan said, "Borrow the chopsticks used for eating to draw with one's fingers." Chopsticks were referred to as zhu, as in Wang Renyu's "Kaiyuan Tianbao Anecdotes," "Song Jing was the prime minister, and the court and the public praised him.... The emperor赐ed Jing with the gold zhu he used." Yuan Li Kan's "Bamboo Manual" also records bamboo zhu, which I will omit here. Chopsticks were referred to as jia, as in the "Book of Rites," "...for soups with vegetables, use jia." Note: "Today, some people call zhu jia." Duan's commentary on "Shuowen" states, "Zhu, the Book of Rites calls it jia, borrowed as zhu." As for the popular name of chopsticks, kuai, it probably did not arise too early. Ming Lu Rong's "Soybean Collection of Miscellaneous Records" states, "Commonly, zhu are called kuai, similar to quick. The custom in Wu is to avoid saying 'zhu' when traveling by boat. Zhu is homophonous with dwell, so zhu is called kuai."

Today, people often have the habit of throwing down their chopsticks in times of worry and anger. Examining historical records, there are precedents for this. The "Book of Jin" records that Wu Yin cried sadly when his mother died and threw down his chopsticks. Jian Sheng's "Wild Tales" records that during the Hongwu period, Song Lian was convicted, and the Empress Dowager prepared a solemn fast, making offerings to protect him. The emperor angrily threw down his chopsticks and stood up. This shows that the nature and habits of people, both ancient and modern, are similar, even down to their underwear.

### Strange Customs Overseas

— Zhu Cangyi

In northern England, when each child is born, the parents give him (or her) a small box containing a pinch of salt, a sixpenny coin, and a box of matches. This symbolizes: salt for health, money for wealth, and matches for lighting the path to heaven.

The American Industrial Association recently created a robot. With its metal arms and rotating head, it realistically makes various gestures and lively speeches. The robot's abdomen contains an electrically powered machine, whose complex structure resembles the human internal organs. When the robot speaks, its hips, arms, and head move simultaneously to show realism.

In post-war Japan, marriage for young men and women is quite problematic, especially for women. A certain magazine社 unexpectedly came up with the unprecedented "Group Partner Finding Meeting." Anyone without a partner can participate. Upon joining, a detailed personal history is filled out, and a numbered badge is issued to be worn on the chest. Afterwards, the desired person is sought in the designated park. If the loved one is found, they go to the office located in the park to investigate the history of the number on their chest. If it is considered acceptable, they go to chat with him (her) and finally submit a marriage proposal.

The place with the most bridges in the world is Venice, Italy. There are more than four hundred bridges in the entire city.

### Scam

— Pei Jing

At the intersection of Jiujiang Road and Fujian Road, a small group of people were engaged in a transaction.

"Who wants yarn? Only 300,000 yuan per pound."

The one shouting was a skinny, short, veteran scammer, wearing a tattered overcoat, holding a ball of red Bee Brand yarn.

"Selling for 300,000 yuan?"

The question came from a barefoot man passing by.

"Still saying it's expensive? Look at the goods, it's Bee Brand!"

"Can you make it cheaper?"

"Heaven knows! The shops are selling it for 700,000 yuan!" the veteran scammer said.

The barefoot man knew this price was very cheap, but he still wanted to bargain. Hearing his reply, he remained silent.

The veteran scammer continued, "This is slightly inferior goods, otherwise, it wouldn't be this cheap."

"How much are you sincerely offering?" a young man interjected.

The barefoot man timidly said, "I only have 200,000 yuan in my pocket, will you sell it?"

"Nonsense, people from Suzhou kill the price by half, go ask around the market and come back."

At this point, the barefoot man realized the tone of his speech was unfavorable and walked away, disappointed.

Seeing the deal fall apart, the veteran scammer made a concession.

"Hey! Come, come, come over here." He raised his hand and beckoned, gesturing for him to return.

Hearing his call, the barefoot man came back.

"I'll add a little to whatever you have, and sell it to you."

"I really only have 200,000 yuan," he replied.

"Okay, I'll sell it to you," he said firmly.

A middle-aged man in a long gown walked past and said to the veteran scammer:

"Watch out for the police! Be sensible."

The veteran scammer quickly hid the ball of red yarn while saying to the barefoot man.

"The police are coming! Let's go to the alley, okay?"

He nodded and followed behind the veteran scammer. They turned a corner and walked into a filthy alleyway, where they all went inside. Out of curiosity, I followed them in as well.

"Sir, can you help me?"

Suddenly, a rough, hoarse voice rang out, and a man stood before me, tall and burly with thick, dark arms. His face was extremely menacing. I realized that he was one of the people standing next to the veteran scammer earlier.

Why did he approach me? I couldn't help but feel suspicious. So, I slowed my pace and watched from a distance.

I saw the veteran scammer in the alley wrap a ball of yarn in paper. Then, he hid it in the tattered coat under his left arm. The barefoot man took out a stack of banknotes, which the veteran scammer took and placed in his pocket. At the same time, he took out a package from under the right arm of his tattered coat, this package was the same as the paper package under his left arm. The barefoot man received the package and walked out triumphantly. The group of scammers quickly walked away as well.

He hadn't walked far before he excitedly opened it to look. Oh no! How could it be a package of filthy rags? It seemed the barefoot man couldn't restrain himself from anger, turning around and angrily chasing after them.

"Hey! What are you doing?" a young man in a suit walked over and asked.

"Look, they sold rags as yarn! Scammers...!" He said as he chased.

"I'll chase after them for you, you go report it to the police first," the young man in the suit said.

The barefoot man chased after them hastily. Seeing that he ignored him, the young man in the suit walked away on his own.

I suddenly understood. It turned out these people were all accomplices! The barefoot man had fallen into their trap.

### The Effect of Color

— Sang

Before going to the market, my wife took a few thousand-yuan bills and said to me, "The paper quality of these thousand-yuan bills is the worst!" But after comparing them with other denominations of banknotes, I didn't think that was entirely true. The reason why people feel the paper is poor is simply because the color printed on the thousand-yuan bill is an unpleasant grey.

People's vision is indeed easily deceived, especially in response to color.

For example, the Blackfriars Bridge in London used to be painted a dark, somber black. Later, because there were frequent suicides on the bridge, the government repainted it a bright green. After the repainting, the number of suicides decreased by a third.

Since an American butcher shop painted its walls green instead of white, its sales have increased significantly. The reason is that white walls leave a grey afterimage in customers' eyes, which also casts a dismal, deathly color on the fresh beef. The green color after the repaint not only does not detract from the beef, but enhances its bright red color.

Another well-known example is that in an American factory, female workers often felt cold while eating in the cafeteria, but the automatic thermostats installed in the cafeteria were not damaged. It seemed that the feeling of cold was impossible. Later, the factory authorities tried repainting the blue walls of the cafeteria a lively orange, and the feeling stopped happening.

Color does have a significant impact on people's psychological feelings. Many factories in the United States have used this color effect to increase worker efficiency and reduce waste in the workplace. In this way, not only are the factory's losses reduced and profits increased, but workers are also spared many possible illnesses due to the improvement of the working environment.

### Tianping and Lingyan

— Zhu Yan

People who visit Suzhou generally have a common problem: they focus too much on the urban area. Watching flowers in the soft, bustling world and seeking fun in the lively scene, this problem is especially prevalent among "Shanghai-style" tourists. This time, due to a chance opportunity, I arrived at this "Venice of the East" garden city, which I had longed to revisit for more than ten years. My first impression was that Suzhou was originally beautiful and quiet, but it had been ruined by those hurried travelers, destroying its charm.

Suzhou is indeed a beautiful city, but its beauty requires living there, slowly appreciating, and enjoying it. True tourists should look for seclusion and leisure in its outskirts. Although Tianping and Lingyan are limited in scope, they still exude a bit of elegance, which is enough for ordinary mortals like us to soothe our emotions and indulge our nature.

After arriving in Mudu by car, there is naturally no need to accept the solicitations of those who say "Do you want a sedan chair?". Just buy a bamboo cane – inexpensive and of good quality – and walk slowly by yourself. This is going up Lingyan. Find a suitable place to sit on the top of the mountain, and in the gentle breeze, look at the rivers, mountains, and green fields below. Taihu Lake is like a mirror, wheat fields are like velvet, and the city of Suzhou is faintly visible with two or three pagoda tops in the hazy smoke. This clear picture and sound will penetrate your heart, unless you truly fall asleep.

I feel that this is enough for enjoying Lingyan. The "Old Site of Wu Palace" is originally the most attractive place, but when we see that it is not "old" at all, our interest is inevitably diminished. As for the temples with walls full of advertisements, and many signs that say "Tourists Keep Out", it is easy to be disappointed.

From Lingyan to Tianping, there is no need to walk the brick-paved slope. Those with strong feet can walk as they please. Everywhere you look are red camellias and white roses. You hop and skip to the foot of the mountain, and you will inevitably pick a large bunch with reluctant to let go of them.

When you arrive at Tianping, you feel the meaning of the words "scenery". Tianping's stones are not dry but fertile, not particularly strange but quite beautiful. Under the pine forest of Fan Zhongyan's tomb, look up at the Baiyun Hermitage on the mountainside, the tourists in the distance, the soaring eagles nearby, and the slight sound of waves brought by the pines... At this time, if you are a poet, you will naturally create poetry; a painter will naturally leave behind his visual beauty; and a fool like me will also feel gratitude and joy in my heart.

There is no need to climb Tianping, because it is suitable for viewing. There is no need to seek out famous scenic spots such as Parrot Stone and A Thread of Sky. In comparison, Tianping is better than Lingyan. The former seems to be a natural beauty, while the latter has traces of makeup everywhere. For the beauty of nature, "natural" is a basic condition.
