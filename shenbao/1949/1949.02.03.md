### Gan Jiehou Ordered to Come to Shanghai Again to Urge Yan Huiqing and Others to Go to Beiping; Shao Lizi Returned to Nanjing Yesterday and Immediately Visited Acting President Li to Talk; Beijing People's Delegation Left Qingdao and Flew North

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Second Dispatch] Gan Jiehou flew to Shanghai again at 1 PM on the afternoon of the second. On the second, Acting President Li ordered him to urge Yan Huiqing and the other five to go to Beiping as soon as possible to promote peace talks.

[Our City News] Gan Jiehou arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon by plane from Nanjing.

[Our Newspaper News] The peace envoy delegation of Yan Huiqing and the other five still had no new developments yesterday. According to Yan's words to reporters: Nanjing has not yet issued an order to depart. The five were entrusted to work for peace. The five envoys themselves generally do not have any problems. The main thing is to see whether the CCP will receive them. Regarding this question, the personal representatives of Acting President Li are currently making preliminary contacts. Once there is a clue, the departure date can be determined, but it is expected that it will be difficult to make the trip in the next three to five days. As for the rumors that the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation came to Shanghai to contact us, that is not the case. According to Zhang Shizhao's words to reporters: He was entrusted to work for peace, and his mind is like a blank sheet of paper. He does not have any preconceived notions. Therefore, if he goes to Beiping, whatever is written on the blank sheet of paper, he will bring it back and submit it to the authorities for reference.

[Central News Agency Our City News] Jiang Yong (one of the five representatives), who is preparing to go to Beiping in a private capacity to make contact with the CCP, denied yesterday the rumors that they would bring a concrete peace plan to conduct important negotiations with the CCP, and stated that the news reported that the delegation held a meeting on the morning of the second to assign duties was inaccurate. Jiang said: Their purpose is only to urge the CCP to quickly appoint representatives for peace talks and decide on the time and place for holding peace talks. There are no other tasks. Regarding the five representatives, it is reported that Jiang Yong, Zhang Shizhao, and Yan Huiqing are eager to work for peace and have no problems. Yan is old and frail and will invite a doctor to accompany him. Chen Guangfu is still considering it and generally has no problems. Only Leng Yuqiu, Speaker of the Jiangsu Provincial Council, is unsure whether he can get away to go to Beiping because the Provincial Council is about to hold a meeting.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Second Dispatch] Shao Lizi flew from Shanghai to Nanjing on a China Aviation plane at 10:10 AM on the second. After taking a short rest at his residence, he went to visit Acting President Li for talks. The content is unknown. In the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by President Yu of the Supervisory Yuan. According to Shao's words to reporters, Yan Huiqing and others had invited him to go to Beiping first. He has not yet made a definite reply, but if he goes with Yan and others, it will be temporarily in a personal capacity, not as a government representative to formally negotiate with the Communists.

[Associated Press Nanjing Second Dispatch] The government is now waiting for the CCP to designate its peace representatives and decide on the time and place for peace talks. It is generally hoped that this will be realized in the near future, possibly within this week, because the Communist army has entered Beiping and completely occupied the urban area. In the past, it was generally believed that the military occupation of Beiping was the CCP's so-called "complete liberation of Beiping."

[Our Newspaper Qingdao Second Dispatch] Qiu Zhizhong and others of the Beijing People's Peace Delegation flew from Nanjing to Beiping on the first. Because the Beiping airport was unable to be contacted during the transition period, they landed in Qingdao midway at 5 PM. They left on the morning of the second.

[Central News Agency Qingdao Second Dispatch] Qiu Zhizhong, head of the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation, and delegation members Wu Yuhao, Deng Jiyu, Zeng Zisheng, Mo Guoshu, and Xia Yuanzhi, along with eight people and 16 accompanying reporters, flew from Nanjing to here on a special plane at 5 PM on the afternoon of the first. Because it was too late, they stayed in Qingdao overnight and flew to Beiping from Cang kou Airport on the afternoon of the second. It is said that the delegation will stay in Beiping for about two days and return to Nanjing on the fourth.

### The Government Seeks Peace, Its Sincerity Has Always Been Consistent; Responsible Leaders Can Return to Nanjing from Guangzhou at Any Time

[Central News Agency Our City News] Recently, there has been much speculation about the government's move to the south, with various rumors circulating. Our agency reporter specifically visited the government spokesperson, who told us the following:

The government seeks peace with the greatest sincerity, consistently and tirelessly. The Executive Yuan meeting on January 19 decided: "The CCP and the government are willing to cease fire unconditionally first and appoint representatives to conduct peace talks." This shows that the government has further advocated peace in order to respect the wishes of the people of the whole country and has proven the government's sincerity in hoping to achieve peace as soon as possible. However, according to the Xinhua News Agency's broadcast on the evening of the 21st, the CCP spokesperson said that this proposal was closing the door to peace and accused the government of being unwilling to send representatives to discuss specific methods for stopping the war. The government's enthusiasm for peace was not diminished by this. On the 22nd, the government appointed representatives and waited for the CCP to propose a date and place for negotiations. The CCP's response was that the Communist army was advancing steadily and there was no sign of ceasing operations. Although the government leaders sincerely hoped for peace, they could not sit idly by and be coerced for half a year. Therefore, the Executive Yuan's 41st meeting on January 26 resolved that the government would move to Guangzhou and begin working in Guangzhou on February 5. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs formally notified the embassies of various countries and asked them to move south together. Acting President Li came to Shanghai on January 31 and convened a meeting with the heads of various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan who were passing through Shanghai to Guangzhou. It was decided that the government would continue to devote itself to the pursuit of peace with the utmost sincerity in order to eliminate the scourge of war and relieve the suffering of the people as soon as possible. After the government moves to Guangzhou, responsible leaders can return to Nanjing at any time to continue to work towards the realization of peace talks.

### Large Detachment of Communist Cavalry Continues to Enter Beiping

Beijing Hotel Has Been Taken Over; Gold Yuan Notes Have Started to Be Exchanged

[United Press Beiping Second Dispatch] The Beiping People's Government started working on the second. This institution was founded a month ago and its headquarters are in Shijiazhuang. The new institution is under the jurisdiction of Ye Jianying, who thus became the mayor.

[Also Electric] Communist troops continued to enter Beiping on the second, including a large detachment of cavalry that entered along Yongdingmen Avenue. Most of the cavalry rode good Japanese horses, while others rode strong Mongolian horses.

[Also Electric] The Communist army took over the Beijing Hotel, the bustling center of the ancient capital, on the second. The hotel is a six-story building that overlooks Dongjiaominxiang and is the tallest building in Beiping. The Communists intend to use it as a military hotel. The guests in the hotel rooms have been ordered to move out.

[Also Electric] The Military Management Committee announced on the second that the Renminbi is the legal basic currency in Beiping. Gold Yuan notes should be banned immediately, but for the convenience of the public, they are allowed to continue to circulate for 20 days. Starting from February 2, workers, students, factory workers, and the poor can exchange Gold Yuan notes for Renminbi at a rate of three to one, up to 300 yuan. Amounts exceeding this will be exchanged at the ordinary exchange rate. The ordinary exchange rate will be set later. Moving Gold Yuan notes out of the Beiping area requires special permission.

[Associated Press Beiping Second Dispatch] General Ye Jianying entered the city in the dark on the evening of the first, rather than with a triumphal entry as everyone had speculated. It is reported that the Beiping "Temporary Mixed Committee" met in the city on the second, but there is still no real news about what was discussed. One of the most likely issues discussed was the currency system. The currency system is still in a state of chaos. According to a newspaper report, Gold Yuan notes will be allowed to circulate for another ten days, and the exchange rate between them and Renminbi and foreign currency will be announced on the third.

[Also Electric] The Beiping edition of the People's Daily was launched on the second, and the Xinhua News Agency branch was established on the same day.

### Gathering of Generals in Lanzhou

Zhang Zhizhong Convenes Officers for Instructions

[Our Newspaper Lanzhou Second Dispatch] Generals are gathering in Lanzhou. Ma Hongbin, Deputy Commander of the Northwest Military and Political Office, also arrived in Lanzhou at 10:30 PM on the evening of the first. At noon on the second, Commander Zhang Zhizhong convened officers above the level of section chief and staff from the Northwest Military and Political Office and the troops in Lanzhou for instructions. Ma Hongkui, Ma Bufang, Guo Jiquiao, Li Tiejun, and others were all present.

[Our Newspaper Lanzhou Second Dispatch] Ma Bufang expressed his views on the current situation in Lanzhou, saying: Peace is certainly good, but whether the Communist Party is sincere is worth questioning. Commander Zhang has now returned, which is just right for strengthening the unity of the Northwest provinces. The Qinghai troops are currently responsible for part of the defense of Gansu and Xinjiang provinces, and the burden is quite heavy.

### Soviet Ambassador Roshen Arrives in Guangzhou, Becoming the First Member of the Diplomatic Corps to Travel South

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Second Dispatch] Soviet Ambassador Roshen left Nanjing on a China Aviation special plane at 10:10 AM on the morning of the second with 12 members of the embassy. Before taking off, Shao Lizi happened to arrive from Shanghai on a plane landing. Shao boarded the Soviet plane after getting off his plane and had a brief conversation with Roshen for a few minutes before saying goodbye. Gao Helu, counselor of the British Embassy, and secretarial staff of the embassies of India, Burma, and other countries also flew to Guangzhou on another China Aviation special plane on the morning of the second.

[United Press Nanjing Second Dispatch] Soviet Ambassador Roshen flew to Guangzhou on the second, becoming the first member of the diplomatic corps to move south with the government. Other envoys, except for Czechoslovakia and Poland, only sent a small number of representatives to the south.

[Central News Agency Guangzhou Second Dispatch] Soviet Ambassador to China Roshen and his entourage of 36 people flew from Nanjing to Guangzhou on China Aviation special plane No. 532 at 10 AM on the morning of the second and arrived at Baiyun Airport at 2:30 PM in the afternoon. Guo Dehua, special envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, and others went to the airport to welcome them. Ambassador Roshen and others are now staying at the Aiqun Hotel.

### Spokesperson of the Capital Garrison Headquarters Talks, Emphasizing Overall Peace; Yangtze River Defense is Solid; Martial Law is Strengthened in Areas Close to the War Zone

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Second Dispatch] At a press conference held by the Capital Garrison Headquarters on the morning of the second, Luo Chunbo, Director of the Political Warfare Department and spokesperson of the headquarters, said regarding martial law: Although Acting President Li ordered the lifting of martial law, exceptions were made for areas close to the war zone. Therefore, martial law is still enforced along the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou line. Especially in the capital, where public security is important, the headquarters is responsible for strengthening its implementation. Luo also formally refuted the rumors about "partial peace" in Nanjing and Shanghai. He said: Wang Yidong, who claims to be a representative of Li Jishen, used to be the executive director of the pawnshop industry association and is now everywhere flaunting and inciting so-called partial peace. He emphasized that the peace that the government is sincerely striving for is overall peace, equal peace. In order to achieve peace, the national army has withdrawn south from the Huaihe River line to the final Yangtze River defense line. It is not that they cannot fight, but to show the government's sincerity and determination to seek peace. If the Communist army attempts to cross the river and continue to attack, the national army will counterattack. The Yangtze River is a natural barrier, and the capital is stable. The talk of partial peace is ridiculous.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Second Dispatch] Yi Peixun, Director of the Third Department of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, reported on the war situation in Jiangbei at a press conference on the second, saying: The current situation is extremely stable. As of now, there are no signs that the Communist army intends to cross the river immediately. Although the national army has taken the initiative to withdraw from some areas, only local Communists are active in these areas. The main force of the Communist army urgently needs to be reorganized after the Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign. The national army on the Yangtze River line is strong and the river defense is solid. There is no need to worry about the defense along the Nanjing-Shanghai line.

[Associated Press Nanjing Second Dispatch] Acting President Li convened a meeting of generals above the division commander level on the first and instructed them to remain in their original defenses and continue to prepare for war, pending the outcome of the peace talks. According to people close to Acting President Li, the government's policy is to do everything possible to reach a peaceful solution with the Communist Party, but "if the Communist army attempts to cross the river, they will be repelled." A military spokesperson on the second absolutely denied the news from a certain foreign news agency (not the Associated Press) that "the national army will abandon the Yangtze River defense line, Shanghai, and Nanjing and defend the line from Hangzhou to Hankou if the peace talks fail."

[Our Newspaper Puzhen Second Dispatch] The southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway remained calm on the second with no fighting. The national and communist armies are still facing each other north and south of Wuyi Town.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Second Dispatch] According to a spokesperson for the Capital Garrison Headquarters, Yizheng City is indeed still held by the national army. Although Liuhe City has been abandoned, the Liuhe County government continues to operate somewhere within the county. The situation was tense at the end of last month, and there were rumors that three or four hundred local Communists were attempting to cross the river, but it has been learned that these were all false rumors. Furthermore, Jiangpu and Chaoxian are also still firmly held by the national army.

### Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng Will Be Released Soon

[Associated Press Nanjing First Dispatch] It was learned on the second that Chen Cheng, Chairman of Taiwan, and Yang Sen, Mayor of Chongqing, recently sent a telegram to Acting President Li, saying that they will release Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng soon.

### Legislators Remaining in Nanjing Write to President Sun, Requesting that Executive Yuan Leaders Return to Nanjing; Where the Legislative Yuan Meets Will Be Determined by the Overall Situation

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Second Dispatch] Legislators remaining in Nanjing, including Lu Yuwen, Fan Yushui, Luo Mengce, Wang Hongshao, Rong Zhao, and Li Feng, wrote jointly to Executive Yuan President Sun on the second, pointing out that the Executive Yuan had only decided to relocate part of the ministries and commissions to Guangzhou for office work, which did not affect Nanjing's position as the political center. They asked Sun to convey that the leaders of the ministries and commissions should still return to Nanjing, and the Executive Yuan meetings should continue to be held in Nanjing to make decisions on political affairs and seek peace. The fourteen legislators have also sent their letters to Legislative Yuan President Tong and Acting President Li and asked Acting President Li to preside over the matter so that Executive Yuan meetings can still be held in Nanjing to reassure the public and benefit peace.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Second Dispatch] Chen Kewen, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, took a night train to Shanghai on the second. In addition to carrying the letter from the fourteen legislators in Nanjing to Executive Yuan President Sun, he also carried President Tong's order to contact legislators in Shanghai and Hangzhou to inquire about their opinions on the location of the third session. It is reported that there are currently about 30 legislators remaining in Nanjing. They all believe that the Legislative Yuan should still reconvene in Nanjing. They have expressed this intention to President Tong, but whether this can become a reality depends on the evolution of the situation and the public opinion of legislators in various places.

[Central News Agency Nanjing Second Dispatch] According to the Constitution, the third session of the Legislative Yuan should convene this month. The government has now moved to Guangdong. Whether the Legislative Yuan will convene in Guangdong and when it can convene are matters of great concern to society. Yesterday, the reporter asked President Tong Guanxian, who told us the following: The government is now partially working in Guangdong and has not clearly ordered the relocation of the capital. The political center is still in Nanjing. As for the Legislative Yuan convening, the legislators are legally required to convene automatically. Where it will convene and when it will convene in the future will depend on the opinions of the majority of the legislators and the situation of the overall situation. Although this Yuan has dispatched personnel to Guangzhou to make necessary preparations, it is only a preparation for emergencies.

### Nantong Command Post Moves to Yu County; County Government Moves to Changyinsha

[Our Newspaper Changshu Second Dispatch] The Nantong Command Post of the First Pacification Zone has been ordered to move. Commander Gu Xijiu and others have arrived. The Nantong County government and part of the local defense forces have also moved to Changyinsha (under Nantong jurisdiction) to work.

### Evacuation Trains Pass Through Jiangxi One After Another

[Our Newspaper Nanchang Second Dispatch] Evacuation trains from various central agencies are passing through Jiangxi one after another and heading to Hunan. The Legislative Yuan's special train passed through Nanchang and transferred to Guangzhou on the afternoon of the second.

### President Chiang Travels to Yueling

[Central News Agency Hangzhou Second Dispatch] Xikou News: President Chiang visited Ningbo on the first and returned at noon. On the morning of the second, he went to Yueling, a scenic area in Fenghua, for a short trip. Chiang Ching-kuo and Yu Jishi accompanied him. Chen Yi, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, went to Xikou from Hangzhou on the afternoon of the first to pay his respects to the President and inquire about his health.

### US Fleet Will Leave Qingdao; Badger Plans to Come to Shanghai in Two Weeks

[Associated Press Qingdao Second Dispatch] Vice Admiral Badger, commander of the US Western Pacific Fleet, revealed on the second that he will sail to Shanghai within two weeks on the flagship USS Eldorado. When the flagship leaves Qingdao, the headquarters of the Western Pacific Fleet will also move away at the same time.

He made it clear that regardless of whether the flagship sails to Shanghai, Hong Kong, or any Chinese seaport, the Western Pacific Fleet will continue to carry out the State Department's mission of protecting American citizens and major assets. He reiterated that this is a policy that the United States has already decided on and has not changed in the current situation.

Vice Admiral Badger told the Associated Press reporter alone on the flagship: The changing situation in Qingdao and other coastal areas of China may lead to some adjustments to the Navy and Marine Corps under his command, but based on the position of national interests, he refused to provide detailed figures on personnel transfers and reductions, but he pointed out: The Marines currently stationed on ships anchored in Qingdao may be transferred to Shanghai to replace the Marines stationed on the Pfeiffert in Shanghai, and some may be sent back to Guam, the Ryukyu Islands, and other Pacific regions, because the normal service equipment there is much better than Qingdao. He said: "Qingdao is an ideal place for us, but now that the evacuation of American citizens has been completed, the need for naval service no longer exists. We are making adjustments to suit the needs of the situation. We will still leave some military force in Qingdao, but only enough to perform the tasks we are responsible for. The excess personnel will be transferred to places with better training facilities, and we will maintain a patrol team on land in Qingdao."

[Associated Press Washington First Dispatch] The State Department refused to comment on the first whether the US naval strike team stationed in Qingdao is preparing to withdraw due to increased military pressure on the city from the Communist and national armies. Any information will be released by Vice Admiral Badger. The National Defense Security Council has authorized Badger to withdraw the Marines stationed in Qingdao in an emergency. Although there is a lack of information here about the future plans of the Marines, it is speculated that they will not stay in Qingdao, which is surrounded by the Communist army, for long.

### Our Two Warships Visit San Francisco

[United Press San Francisco First Dispatch] The Chinese warships "Taihe" and "Taishan" are scheduled to arrive here on the fifth of this month. After visiting for some time, they will return home. Each ship has 200 officers and soldiers. The two ships were given to China by the United States and have been training at the Norfolk Naval Base for three months.

### National Army in Southern Henan Returns to Defend Queshan; Zhang Zhen Rushes Back to Xinyang to Command Troops to Move Northward; Jiangxi Defense in Southern Jiangxi is Strengthened and Northern Jiangxi is Tranquil

[Our Newspaper Xinyang Second Dispatch] Military News: Liu Bocheng's troops, who had infiltrated Queshan, retreated southwest across the railway on the first due to the national army's strict defense in Xinyang. The national army returned to defend Queshan that night.

[Our Newspaper Xinyang Second Dispatch] Commander Zhang Zhen led his troops back to Xinyang on the second to command the northward advancing army to launch a sweep of Zhang Tixue's local Communist troops in the Guangshan and Huangchuan areas on the east side of the Pinghan Railway. The tense situation in southern Henan for three days has stabilized slightly. Furthermore, military transport on the Pinghan Railway between Han and Xin is frequent, and passenger and freight transport can return to normal. The Railway Bureau is actively repairing the railway between Xinyang and Queshan.

[Our Newspaper Hankou Second Dispatch] Military News: The situation in southern Henan has stabilized. A force of Liu Bocheng's troops has fled from Luohe and Queshan to Fangcheng and Nanyang Xipu. The national army is on guard.

[Our Newspaper Nanchang Second Dispatch] After the Communist Party reported the military situation in Jiangbei and the provincial government's relocation and other news based on a report from a Hangzhou newspaper reporter stationed in Jiangxi, the provincial government denied it and investigated the source of the news. According to the information obtained by our newspaper reporter from the authorities on the second, it has been confirmed that Huangmei, Guangji, and other cities in Jiangbei are still held by the national army. Only Zhang Tixue and other local Communists are stepping up their conscription of troops and food in the area north of the county seat. Judging from the current situation, there is no sign of a southward invasion. Since a certain army was dispatched to Southern Jiangxi, the river defense has been strengthened. A certain commander will be stationed in Jiujiang. The Jiangbei and Northern Jiangxi areas are now tranquil, and the Jiangxi Security Corps still has local troops stationed on the Jiangbei front line.

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou First Dispatch] Since the national army withdrew to the south, many troops have stayed in Hangzhou. According to various signs, the national army has begun to deploy defenses. Transportation construction in western Zhejiang has generally stagnated, while the construction of bridges on the eastern Zhejiang highway is actively underway. The newly built bridges can carry a load of 10 tons. The Zhejiang-Fujian and Zhejiang-Jiangxi lines are ensured to be smooth. The coastal highway will be open to Yongjia by the end of February and to Lishui by the end of March. The city of Hangzhou also shows signs of wartime everywhere.

### The Frustration of Statesmanship

— February 2nd, Editorial from the English-language "Ta Mei Wan Bao"

On January 24th, we published a jubilant editorial entitled "The Best News So Far." At the time of writing that editorial, Acting President Li had just announced a number of decisive reform measures, and the Chinese Communists had also issued peace terms from Beiping that appeared to be quite lenient.

These two things combined offered China a real opportunity. Although many disappointing events have occurred in the past few days, we still feel that our claim at that time was correct.

Following the aforementioned editorial on January 24th, we also published another editorial on the same day, entitled: "The Time to Show Statesmanship." At the time, no one seemed to pay attention to this second editorial, and now it seems that everyone has completely forgotten it. However, this one should have been given attention along with the previous one. China has faced a good opportunity – but statesmanship is simply nowhere to be seen. As a result, as things stand, this good opportunity is rapidly fading away.

On January 24th, we thought that perhaps Vice President Li had already consulted with the Chinese Communists while President Chiang was still in office. On this point, we seem to have been completely wrong. Not only is there no sign of prior consultation, but every hour of delay has undermined any opportunity for negotiation. The disintegration of the National Government (original text – translator) is accelerating, and this disintegration, after a considerable period, may make the peace that Li and his confidants can achieve only of a partial nature, not a national one.

To Chinese people accustomed to domestic division, this development may not be a terrible disaster, but it is certainly not worthy of statesmanship.

When Li took power, he assumed the position of the "de facto" leader of a "de jure" government. What we mean is that although President Chiang only "withdrew," and in reality, still seemed to be remotely directing affairs, the power taken over by Li was diplomatically recognized by the world powers and had representatives in the United Nations organization. Even if this regime was bogged down and suffering setbacks, it was still legitimate. However, after Li took over, his subordinates did not cooperate to realize his reform measures, and some military commanders apparently refused to accept orders, so their troops quickly moved away. From these places, it seems that Li has not been able to fully control the institution. However, in the eyes of the world, Li is now the leader of a generally recognized Chinese government, so if the Chinese Communists can quickly sign a peace treaty with him now, it would be in the interest of the Chinese Communists, also in Li's interest, and also beneficial to China, because any agreement and unification would be better than all the situations that have occurred in the past or may occur in the future.

As things stand now, we don't think Li is wrong. The mistake was made by the Chinese Communists, and perhaps they deliberately made this mistake. If this is indeed the case, we think their vision is too short-sighted. This mistake will cause China to encounter a longer period of struggle before any signs of unification can be obtained, and the people will suffer for a longer period of time – and causing the people to suffer is completely contrary to the claims that the Chinese Communists have always advocated.

Perhaps their reason for doing so is to obtain unconditional surrender, and they believe that a partial unconditional surrender is more beneficial than negotiating peace with the government represented by Li—because after negotiating peace with the government, it is necessary to immediately eliminate uncooperative elements. However, these uncooperative elements, which may even include President Chiang himself, can be called rebels, and the Chinese Communists themselves have long been given this title.

Other than that, we really don't understand why there is such a lack of statesmanship in insisting on handing over war criminals. In the past, when President Roosevelt faced this situation in the war against Japan, his attitude was exactly the opposite of that of the Chinese Communists; admittedly, he also demanded unconditional surrender, but he never made a big fuss about the war crimes issue first, and he especially exempted the head of state from the war crimes punishment, because Emperor Hirohito assisted in the surrender. Li should of course receive this treatment immediately, and if Chiang Kai-shek's name can be permanently removed from this list, it will definitely receive the support of the people of the whole country. Mayor Wu of Shanghai should not be included in this list at all. In fact, since international law does not apply in civil wars, the entire idea of punishing "war criminals" is untenable.

It is not too late to clean up now. However, in such events, time will quickly disappear. Soon, the opposition within the Kuomintang may make any peace that Li can achieve as localized as Chuan Zuoyi's peace. In this way, various difficulties will be prolonged, and it will also cause many unnecessary or even malicious diplomatic recognition issues. In short, everything will be messed up. We are not as happy as we used to be. More and more important people in Chinese history have the same feeling, and undoubtedly they feel it more deeply than we do.

Editorial

### Starting with Stalin's Peace Posture

Stalin recently answered questions from a reporter from the American International News Service and put forward four opinions on current world problems: (1) The Soviet government is prepared to consider issuing a joint declaration with the US government stating that neither the US nor the Soviet government has any intention of resorting to force; (2) The Soviet government is clearly cooperating with the United States to implement this non-war treaty and leading countries to gradually reduce armaments; (3) If the governments of Britain, the United States, and France can agree to temporarily suspend the establishment of a West German government and wait for a meeting of foreign ministers to review the entire German issue, then the Soviet government is willing to lift its blockade of Berlin, provided that the governments of Britain, the United States, and France also lift their restrictions on transportation and trade at the same time; (4) I have repeatedly stated that I am willing to meet with President Truman to directly discuss the possibility of this peace treaty.

These four opinions can be said to be Stalin's new peace posture. Regardless of whether Stalin's remarks can become a reality, in today's suffocatingly low international atmosphere, they are still a glimmer of light in the darkness, and to peace-loving people around the world, they feel like exciting tidings of peace. Therefore, diplomatic figures in London and Washington heard Stalin's statement and rekindled hopes for world peace, which had reached an impasse. However, the reaction of the British and American governments was not as enthusiastic as ideal.

Washington was not only very cold, but also believed that Stalin's statement was a kind of "peace offensive" to divert the attention of Western countries that are currently focused on the North Atlantic Treaty. President Truman read the full text of Stalin's statement and did not comment on it. His secretary, Ross, told the press that President Truman had repeatedly stated that Stalin was welcome to come to Washington at any time and that he would be willing to talk to him. However, diplomatic figures in general hope that the Soviet Union can show concrete actions after displaying its new peace posture.

In Britain, diplomatic figures were very shocked by Stalin's new peace posture, but the Foreign Office remained indifferent. According to a Foreign Office spokesperson, Britain will consult with the United States and France on Stalin's remarks to study the possibility of improved relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, before Stalin made his remarks, the Soviet Foreign Ministry published a white paper fiercely attacking the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty, accusing Britain and the United States of moving towards a new international war. Based on this, it is clear that Britain cannot fully trust Stalin's true intentions.

Looking back at international politics since the end of World War II, it is not difficult to prove that the crux of today's international problems lies in the irreconcilable differences between the United States and the Soviet Union. If these two world powers can reconcile and repair their relationship, then all current international problems, whether European or Asian, may be solved easily. Based on this view, we believe that if the world is to achieve true peace, it is necessary to first seek understanding and coordination between the United States and the Soviet Union. Any actions that can truly promote improved relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, no matter where they originate, are welcomed by us peace-loving people. I remember that the Soviet Embassy in the United States published an article in mid-last month advocating "mutual understanding to promote friendship between the United States and the Soviet Union." At that time, we attached great importance to it and hoped that it could become an opportunity for a change in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, the US attitude was cold, and it burst like a soap bubble. Acting Secretary of State Lovett also expressed welcome to the Soviet Union's peaceful intentions at the time, but still insisted that the Soviet Union should show concrete actions to prove its sincerity for peace. Now, although the US Secretary of State has changed, the US attitude towards the Soviet Union remains the same. For this reason, the hope for peace sparked by Stalin's remarks may also disappear like a soap bubble.

Standing in the position of a third party, observing US-Soviet relations, whether in terms of ideology or interests, they are in opposite positions. Today, if we want the two countries to improve their relations, dispel suspicions, and reconcile, it cannot be achieved overnight. However, the opportunity to improve Soviet-American relations, like other opportunities, is fleeting. Now that there is a new brewing in the international community, the United States and the Soviet Union should especially cherish this good opportunity. On Stalin's side, now that he has displayed a new peace posture, he should show more concrete actions to prove that he is truly sincere; and on the American side, it should also seize the opportunity to eliminate the hostility between the two countries and reverse the adverse currents in the international community.

However, President Truman said during the campaign, "We all need peace," so why can't he wholeheartedly embrace Stalin's suggestion at this time and meet in a certain place immediately? And why do American diplomatic circles hope that the Soviet Union can show significant concrete actions? In a word, judging from the actions of the Communist International, the United States cannot easily believe in the sincerity of the Soviet Union's peace overtures. By analogy, China hopes that they will have some concrete actions, and not just a "command" posture in the broadcast. What are the concrete actions? First of all, both sides agree to an immediate ceasefire!

### Wuhan Implements Emergency Measures; Two Rice Robbers Executed by Firing Squad; Gold and Silver Dealers Also to be Executed; Black Market Plummets

[Our Newspaper Hankou 2nd Dispatch] After the Wuhan Garrison Command submitted a request to the Central China authorities for the promulgation of four emergency punishment measures to severely punish those who create rumors and cause trouble, a large number of officers were dispatched today to resolutely take action. Tan Jialiang and Wu Ying, the ringleaders who deliberately made alarmist remarks and gathered crowds to rob rice, were escorted through the city at 3 p.m. and executed by firing squad. Nine accomplices were tied up at the execution ground as a warning. In addition, many silver dealers who created a black market for gold and silver will also be sentenced to death.

We had to prepare in the past, and we must prepare even more today. (2) Peace cannot be sought on one side. If there is war in the future, the responsibility lies entirely with the Chinese Communists. (3) In order to crack down on bizarre rumors and prevent disruptive behavior, the public security authorities have promulgated emergency measures, which will be implemented immediately. (4) The military and police live a hard life. It has been decided to issue silver dollars for food expenses immediately.

(6) The media should promote justice, distinguish right from wrong, and I respect freedom of speech. I hope you will conduct your own checks and not let others check you. After Bai finished speaking, Commander Chen announced the emergency measures: (1) Those who rob property in groups will be killed. (2) Those who spread rumors and disrupt public order will be killed. (3) Those who engage in black market activities and disrupt the currency system will be killed. Chen also said: Killing people to save people is compassion, not cruelty. Our purpose is to maintain order, so we only kill bad people and never kill good people. In addition, Commander-in-Chief Bai expressed his approval of Hunan Province's issuance of silver-based subsidiary coins and ordered the Political Committee to invite financial circles and experts to form a seven-member group to announce reasonable and effective measures as soon as possible.

### McCarran's Aid to China Plan; Will Be Submitted This Month; Denounces Stalin's "Peace Movement"

[Central News Agency Washington 1st Dispatch] Democratic Senator McCarran, Chairman of the US Congressional Oversight Committee on Foreign Aid, today denounced Stalin's "peace movement" as one of his old tricks, attempting to divert American attention from the Communist gains in China. McCarran proposed a $1.5 billion economic and military aid to China plan on the 31st and issued a statement today stating that Stalin's new offensive shows that a realistic US aid to China plan should be passed as soon as possible, because "this move is related to the safety of Asia." He also warned that in order to prevent China from falling to Communist conquest, aid to China is urgently needed, and if the United States wants to achieve President Truman's goal of assisting backward countries, which he announced in his inaugural address, then "We must maintain a "firm foothold" in China." If we do nothing in China, our position will be determined by others. If it is unfortunate, the master of that decision is undoubtedly the Chinese Communists. Also, if we do not provide China with assistance today, and know that the assistance can save the Chinese government from complete disintegration, then we will lose some resources in the future. The resources are not only necessary for the national defense of the United States, but also necessary for our way of life. So far, McCarran has not drafted his aid to China plan and sent it to Congress to be passed into law. He told a reporter from the Central News Agency that he will submit it this month and is waiting for the government's response.

[US Information Service Washington 1st Dispatch] The State Department recently announced that as of last Friday, under the $122.5 million additional aid to China plan, $122,977,994.27 has been paid out.

Of this amount, $275 million is purely economic aid, which is implemented by the Economic Cooperation Administration. The remaining $122.5 million is additional aid, which is designated by the Chinese government for the purchase of military supplies.

### Extraordinary Results in Promoting Benefits and Eliminating Evils: The Achievements of the Female Magistrate of Xifeng County - A Dispatch from Guiyang, January 26

— By Our Reporter Liu Mengchi

Xu Fangyuan, the female magistrate of Xifeng County, had only been in office for a short time last summer when Gu Zhenglun, known for his emphasis on law, practicality, and lack of levity, returned to Guizhou to take charge. At the time, everyone assumed she would likely be replaced. However, she managed to hold onto her position and even seemed to have "quite a reputation for effective governance."

After taking office as the provincial chairman, Gu Zhenglun met with county magistrates in batches. When Magistrate Xu paid her respects to the chairman, the attendants mistook her for Magistrate Xu's wife and asked Gu Zhenglun whether or not to grant her an audience. This became a well-known anecdote. Because she had received higher education and engaged in women's movements for many years, she relied on her persuasive skills to discuss everything from local grassroots politics to her life aspirations. It is said that her initial audience with Chairman Gu lasted about two hours, exceeding the speaking time of any other county magistrate. Gu had a "very good impression" of her, and her position as county magistrate was thus secured.

Unanimous Praise from All Quarters

In winter, Lü Chao, a supervisor from the Supervisory Yuan's Guizhou Supervisory Committee, came to Guizhou for inspection. He spent a week in Xifeng, inspecting the work of the female magistrate. After returning to Guiyang and Kunming, he repeatedly praised her verbally to newspaper reporters, and newspapers published articles praising her. Recently, the Guizhou Provincial Government's year-end county administration inspection team set out in different directions to inspect the administration of various counties. Xie Boyuan, director of the Provincial Food Bureau, who was responsible for inspecting Xifeng County's administration, reported back to the province, highly commending Xifeng County's administration, especially its food administration and conscription. The Provincial Military Control Area Headquarters also believed that she was able to comply with laws and regulations and complete tasks legally and on time, giving her a major commendation. After these several "praises" and "evaluations," the female magistrate not only secured her position but also "rose to prominence."

This reporter recently conducted a personal inspection of Xifeng's administration. From the Provincial Government's year-end county administration inspection team and the Military Control Area's conscription inspection personnel, I obtained considerable information about the female magistrate's administration. Coincidentally, yesterday (the 25th), I met the female magistrate herself at the provincial government while she was returning to the province for "both official and private" duties. Because the Lunar New Year was only three days away, the female magistrate requested a week's leave from the provincial government to return to the province for a family reunion. Yesterday, she spoke with the reporter at length about her "sense of reassurance," showing a sense of accomplishment. The facts prove that the female magistrate is indeed different from male magistrates.

According to the female magistrate's response to the reporter, what policy implementation has been most effective since taking office? After a brief consideration, she said frankly, "In Xifeng, I have been striving to implement the chairman's will to reduce the burden on the people, earnestly promote benefits, and eliminate evils. Due to limited financial and human resources, I dare not claim any achievements in policy implementation, but I have indeed made some gains in reducing the people's burden and promoting benefits and eliminating evils. I have personally witnessed it, and it can be said that I have some sense of reassurance." She then recited the theory from "Chairman Gu's Collected Sayings," which she had memorized thoroughly, to the reporter. She said that in the less than ten months since taking office, she had completely visited all seventeen townships in the county once, and every month, she also made special inspections to various townships in different directions, each lasting about a week, to personally see the difficult lives of the people. She pointed to her light gray tweed jacket and cotton cloth trousers and told the reporter, "I only changed into this tweed jacket when I came to the province. In the county, I usually ride a horse to inspect various townships." She replied that she rides her horse very well, traversing mountains and valleys with ease. The female magistrate's body was originally very healthy, and the training of the past nine months has made her even stronger.

Three Key Policies: Food, Conscription, and Salt

She talked the most about Xifeng's food administration. Regarding public grain, she absolutely prohibited the practice of selling it at a low price under false pretenses and then depositing the money into the treasury, while in reality, private individuals bought it and sold it at a high price for personal gain. She said that this kind of "low-price sale and requisition" benefited private individuals at the expense of the public, which she would not allow. Secondly, she strictly prohibited reporting inflated collection figures to superiors and collecting late fees and fines from subordinates, and then using these late fees as "private burdens" for food officials. She said that the collection of land taxes in Xifeng has now truly reached 90%, which can be confirmed by Director Xie of the Provincial Food Bureau. Chairman Gu does not allow land tax officials in various counties to collect taxes under false names and requires the people to assess and collect taxes themselves. The remaining grain underground should be allowed to be disposed of by the people. When she strictly implemented this in Xifeng, the people who delivered grain all praised Chairman Gu endlessly.

After the female magistrate finished talking about how she handled conscription reasonably and legally, conducting open lotteries and strictly prohibiting substitutions, I asked her whether the method of collecting two liters of rice per household per month for self-defense, collected three months at a time, could be said to reduce the burden on the people. She thought for a moment before replying to the reporter, "Xifeng has not yet started collecting it. Collecting two liters of rice per household per month, collected three months at a time, may be difficult. It would be best if it could be determined according to the tax amount, with those who have more money contributing more and those who have less money contributing less, to be fair and reasonable." She indicated that this must be decided by the provincial government, and Xifeng did not dare to make its own decision.

When the reporter talked to her about the abuses of salt administration, she said, "There are no more abuses in Xifeng's salt administration. All that exists is a shortage of quotas." She absolutely prohibits collusion between officials and merchants to profit from salt. Every month, she requires the Salt Industry Association to supervise the wholesale merchants to transport the salt to the county within the specified time and quantity, report the accounts publicly, and then distribute it to various townships, selling it to the people at the prescribed price, and registering it for future verification to check the salt transportation and sales situation from the county to the townships. She said that she had partnered with someone to do salt business in the past and knew that there were many abuses, but since becoming the county magistrate, she had never been involved and had dismissed an official in the county government who held an important position because he was suspected of colluding with salt merchants to do business.

Promoting Education and Growing American Tobacco

Next, the female magistrate talked about her policies for promoting benefits. Xifeng's education, such as township and village national schools, only emphasized quantitative development in the past, forgetting qualitative improvement, especially the funding for education, which was the biggest problem. After taking office, she significantly reduced the number of village national schools, reducing the 54 village national schools in the county's seventeen townships after weighing the pros and cons and concentrating financial and human resources to operate the remaining 27 schools. Because the dispute over temple property being donated as school property had never been resolved over the years, she held a county-wide Buddhist conference, publicly reducing and exempting all donations from the temples, asking them to complete the procedures for the temple property that had already been donated according to their original intention, and inviting the heads of the temples that donated property to the County Education Funding Management Committee to jointly be responsible for safeguarding the property. At the same time, she also numbered and copied all the title deeds of the education property, sending them to the Provincial Department of Education and the County Council for record-keeping. The county's education funding was thus able to operate independently, and there was no need to worry about development in the future.

"Xifeng is too poor, and the people are struggling. When I took office, I advocated planting American tobacco. County government employees also had to participate in planting. At first, everyone was dissatisfied because the price of American tobacco was too low at that time." Magistrate Xu smiled and continued, "Soon, the price of American tobacco rose every day, and now it has reached 1,300 to 1,400 Gold Yuan per hundred catties, and the people are all overjoyed. The total production of American tobacco in the county was less than 50,000 catties last year, and this year it will be at least 300,000 catties. County government employees also harvested 4,000 to 5,000 catties, which I completely handed over to all employees for distribution as a reward for their labor." She also added that the people are short-sighted, and it is easier to eliminate evils, but it is really difficult to promote benefits. However, as long as the government has the determination, after the people receive some benefits, it will be easier to promote policies that benefit them in the future.

The Glory of the Women's World

The female magistrate has won the hearts of the people in Xifeng and has gained confidence in the province. Men have unanimously praised her both in person and behind her back, and especially the women's world feels even more glorious when they mention her. According to people close to the female magistrate, the problem is very simple: she not only does not want to mess with money but is also willing to lose money. Her political desires are very strong, and being a county magistrate is only the starting point of her political life. In addition, she is willing to work hard and is more willing to adopt the opinions of the people, so her position as county magistrate has been secured and has "risen to prominence"! Besides, her "husband," Sun Botao, is a landlord in Dading County and a wealthy man in Guiyang, and he respects her opinions very much.

### Stalin Reiterates Willingness to Meet with Truman, but Avoids Long-Distance Flights on Doctor's Orders; Location in Eastern Europe at the Discretion of the United States

[Report from this newspaper] Washington, 2nd: The full text of Stalin's original letter to Smith of the Paris branch of the American International News Service, as transmitted by a certain London telegraph agency, is as follows: "I am deeply grateful for Mr. Truman's invitation to me to go to Washington. I have long intended to go to Washington. I mentioned this intention to Mr. Roosevelt at Yalta, and I also mentioned it to Mr. Truman at Potsdam. Unfortunately, I am currently unable to fulfill this wish, as my doctor has formally warned me that I should no longer make long journeys, especially by air or sea. If Mr. Truman can come to the Soviet Union, the Soviet government would be most welcome. As for the meeting location, please choose one of the three locations: Kaliningrad, Odessa, or Yalta, at the President's discretion. However, if the aforementioned locations I suggested are not approved, then the President may also choose to explore Poland or Czechoslovakia. Sincerely, Stalin." According to the news agency, little is known about Stalin's health. He has indeed taken many long vacations since the end of the last war. However, foreign envoys who have seen Stalin said that he is energetic and quite healthy. In the recent photos of Stalin, his appearance is really no different from before, except that his temples are more gray. Today, Stalin's letter stated that he is not suitable for flying. Flying is especially unsuitable for patients with certain heart conditions and those with high blood pressure, but most doctors believe that sailing is actually beneficial to patients.

[Report from this newspaper] Washington, 2nd: White House Press Secretary Ross stated that President Truman had not received any invitation from Stalin suggesting what kind of talks he would like to have, and said that, as far as he knows, Truman's most recent statement on this suggestion was that he was willing to meet with Stalin in Washington. Ross stated that Truman only knew of Stalin's recent suggestion from broadcasts and newspapers. When a reporter asked if President Truman was willing to go to Poland or Czechoslovakia, Ross interrupted before the reporter could say the word "Soviet Union," replying, "No comment, that's all."

[Report from this newspaper] Washington, 2nd: A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department stated that he had informally heard rumors of Stalin suggesting a meeting with Truman in the Soviet Union, Poland, or Czechoslovakia, but had no comment on the rumor. Three days ago, Stalin had stated his willingness to sign a "non-aggression" pact with the United States. According to radio reports, one noteworthy point in Stalin's recent statement is that Stalin did not mention locations behind the so-called "Iron Curtain" by Western countries as possible meeting places. Stalin's statement shows that he has no intention of leaving the Soviet-controlled area to discuss peace issues with Truman. The reaction in Washington and London to this statement is that Stalin is merely launching a "peace propaganda offensive." This statement allows Stalin to maintain a position that, if Truman refuses to accept the meeting suggestion, Stalin can announce to the world that the United States is unwilling to discuss peace. Secondly, if Truman accepts the suggestion, it forces Truman to hold talks within the Soviet-controlled area. Although there has been no official statement from London, there is fear that the Soviet Union's "peace offensive" may lead to bilateral talks without the participation of British representatives.

[Report from this newspaper] Washington, 2nd: State Department spokesperson McDermott revealed that no official report had been received regarding Stalin's recent statement, so he did not intend to make any comments for the time being. Washington believes that Stalin's new suggestion to meet with Truman at a time when the details of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are being drafted undoubtedly indicates that the Soviet Union intends to prevent the signing of the treaty. If the Soviet Union can achieve bilateral talks, it will inevitably cause suspicion and distrust of the United States among other Western countries such as Britain and France, and the Soviet Union will achieve a diplomatic victory.

### Royal to Meet with Barr in Japan to Discuss Issues Related to China; U.S. Military Deployment in the Far East Not Expected to Increase

[United Press, Tokyo, 2nd] U.S. Secretary of the Army Royal and his party arrived here yesterday. Today, they reviewed the U.S. occupation forces' First Cavalry Division at the Imperial Plaza. Royal, along with Eighth Army Commander Walker and Division Commander Chase, reviewed the troops from an armored vehicle. When Royal got out of the vehicle, he twisted his ankle and went to the Army Hospital for treatment. He left after twenty minutes.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 2nd] U.S. Secretary of the Army Royal told the press today that the United States currently has no plans to increase the number of troops in the Far East significantly. Although Royal emphasized that the China issue is not the main purpose of his trip, he admitted that the China issue is one of the issues he will be discussing. Royal, who came to Japan with China expert Wedemeyer, will meet with General Barr, the former head of the U.S. military advisory group in Nanjing. When reporters asked if he planned to transfer the Japanese occupation affairs to the U.S. State Department, as with the German occupation affairs, Royal avoided answering directly, but pointed out that his personal opinion is that the Army should return to its military duties and should not manage railways or provide relief. He also said, "I hope the Army will one day return to missions within the military scope." Royal continued to declare that the purpose of his visit to Japan was to understand issues within the military scope, and clarified that the main purpose of his visit was to inspect the U.S. defense operations in the Pacific, and not to deal with economic issues. He also said that Dodge, a banker from Diderick, who came with him, will serve as Mac's special economic advisor and stay in Japan to deal with economic issues. When reporters asked if he was carrying a new economic plan or new instructions from Washington to Mac, Royal replied, "No, I didn't bring a plan. I only brought 'budget and economic stability expert Dodge.'" When reporters asked what his opinion was on the increased power of the Japanese Communist Party in the recent general election results, Royal replied that the people of various countries do not support the left more than before, and even if this is the case, this is probably mostly due to the psychological state of the Far East.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 2nd] The Far East Headquarters announced on the 2nd that the U.S. Military Advisory Group in China will be temporarily located in Tokyo. The office is on the second floor of the Tokyo Imperial Building. The head of the group is Major General Barr, assisted by Rear Admiral Olt and Brigadier General Bilk. The Chief of Staff is Colonel Chamberlin.

### Wallace's Remarks Acknowledge that Stalin's Statement Opens the Door to Peace Talks

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 1st] Former Progressive Party presidential candidate Wallace said today, "For the first time in two years, Stalin has suggested that the United States and the Soviet Union should hold negotiations on various important issues. I am confident that the U.S. government will give a favorable response." Wallace continued, "Stalin has now reopened the door to negotiations, and the conscience of mankind requires that this door must be kept open forever. This is the best moment to hold peace talks to replace military alliances. At this moment, we should continue to move forward and not adopt suicidal policies. At the same time, we should use billions of dollars for military equipment and military alliances such as the Atlantic Treaty. These actions are only enough to cause a final conflict in which no one can win. We should accept Stalin's suggestion and start negotiations to resolve years of disputes." Wallace added that he believes that differences on the German issue can be resolved and insisted that Stalin and Truman should hold consultations before it is "too late."

### Norway Decides to Join the Regional Defense Alliance; Reply to the Soviet Union is Eloquent but Firm

[United Press, Oslo, 1st] Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange presented a reply to Soviet Ambassador Afanasyev today, explaining Norway's attitude toward the North Atlantic Treaty. It stated: Norway will not enter into any agreement with other countries to provide bases for foreign troops unless it is attacked or threatened with aggression.

Norway had hoped that the United Nations would provide the necessary strength to maintain peace and security for all countries in the world, but this hope has not yet been realized. For its own security, Norway firmly believes that it is necessary to promote security through regional defense cooperation. The Norwegian government believes that this regional treaty is in accordance with the United Nations Charter and aims to prevent aggression. Norway will further study in what ways and conditions it may participate in the regional security system. Norway has a long-standing friendship with its neighbor, the Soviet Union, and firmly believes that the Soviet government will recognize Norway's peaceful intentions and its willingness to maintain friendship with all peace-loving countries. The Soviet Union had recently questioned Norway on whether it would join the future North Atlantic Treaty and whether it would provide military bases to Western countries. Semi-official sources said that Norway's reply was firm.

### U.S. Decides to Invite Norway, Italy, and Other Countries to Discuss the Atlantic Treaty

[United Press, Washington, 1st] The U.S. State Department expressed its satisfaction with Norway's decision today to join forces with the Atlantic countries despite Soviet pressure. The department announced that Norway and several other countries will soon be invited to participate in negotiations on the North Atlantic Mutual Defense Treaty.

### The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance in Eastern Europe is Shut Out; Yugoslavia Protests, Alleging that the Soviet Union's Actions Violate the Agreement

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 2nd] Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj declared to Tanjug News Agency today that the Yugoslav government had protested to the Soviet government and other countries convening the conference on cooperation and mutual assistance in Moscow because the Yugoslav government was not invited to participate in the conference, which clearly violated the existing agreements concluded by these countries with the Yugoslav government. However, Kardelj also said that if the current anti-Yugoslav movement stops, Yugoslavia will still participate in the Moscow conference based on the agreements reached at this conference. Kardelj explained that the Yugoslav government had not been informed in advance about the Moscow consultations and had not been invited to participate. He added that the Yugoslav government was quite surprised by this move because Yugoslavia had repeatedly suggested maintaining closer economic cooperation and mutual assistance with various people's democratic countries, while these countries also had mutual assistance and cooperation treaties with Yugoslavia in various aspects. He also said that Yugoslavia would undoubtedly abide by these treaties. After expressing satisfaction that all countries could participate on an equal footing in the resolutions reached at the Moscow conference, Kardelj said that Yugoslavia was prepared to participate based on these conditions. He announced that Yugoslavia had notified this attitude to Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia.

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] U.S. Secretary of Defense Forrestal said today that the strength of the U.S. Air Force may become the most powerful force in the world in the next five or six years, just as the British Navy once held a position in the world. Before that time, in the event of a war, our army, navy, and air force will still have to be mixed. I especially support the establishment of 70 peacetime air groups.

[Associated Press, Washington, 1st] Forrestal revealed on the 1st that the Army, Navy, and Air Force requested $30 billion in the 1950 budget last summer. This amount was proposed last summer when the Berlin blockade and the Czech coup turned the Cold War into a spark of fire. He declared at a national press lunch that it had been reduced to $16.9 billion before being submitted to the Bureau of the Budget, and President Truman had reduced it to $14.4 billion. Forrestal also revealed that General Eisenhower is studying the system of training Army, Navy, and Air Force officers in order to end inter-service competition and complete unification.

### Jiang Tingfu Takes Office as Chairman of the Security Council

The Soviet Union Requests Postponement of the Disarmament Debate

[U.S. News Agency, Lake Success, 1st] Jiang Tingfu has taken office as the Chairman of the Security Council for February, succeeding Canadian McNaughton.

This is the third time the Soviet Union has requested a postponement of the debate, which some sources at the United Nations believe is related to the new spirit of Soviet policy. The same sources believe that Malik's new attitude may be due to his uncertainty about any changes in the Soviet Union's attitude on the basic issue of disarmament.

### South Korea Formally Applies to Join the United Nations

Soviet Opposition Inevitable During Security Council Discussions

[Report from this newspaper] Broadcast from Lake Success, New York, 2nd: The South Korean Foreign Minister formally applied to United Nations Secretary-General Lie to allow South Korea to join the United Nations organization. When this application is submitted to the Security Council for discussion, it seems inevitable that it will be vetoed by the Soviet Union. The South Korean government has been recognized by the United Nations General Assembly as the legitimate government and has received diplomatic recognition from Britain, the United States, and the Philippines. However, the Soviet Union claims that the communist government of North Korea is the only legitimate government, so the Soviet Union may prevent South Korea from joining the United Nations.

### Satisfactory Results of National-Communist Postal Service; Postal Administration Sends Urgent Telegrams to Various Regions Ordering Trial Implementation Based on Local Conditions

[Our Newspaper] After the trial implementation of the National-Communist postal service by the Shanghai Postal Administration, initial results have been satisfactory. It has been learned that the Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications has sent urgent telegrams to the postal administrations of Jiangsu, Anhui, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Hubei, and Shanxi provinces, ordering them to find ways to implement postal services locally. At the same time, it also issued a notice to postal employees in areas where war breaks out, allowing them to temporarily seek refuge in nearby safe locations, and to return to their original locations and resume operations when there is no danger to life, and to communicate with various places. As for the methods of communication, the situation in each district is different, and at present, it can only be adapted to local conditions and individual methods, and some key points are suggested: (1) Those who have transportation passing through or directly reaching should request to carry mail. (2) When no transportation is available, organize postmen to deliver mail, detouring when necessary. This method is purely experimental, and if the results are good, the General Post Office will find a way to standardize the regulations.

### Shi Meiyu Issues Statement on the Declaration of Innocence for Okamura; Japanese War Criminals Escorted to Sugamo Prison in Tokyo is an Emergency Evacuation, Not a Release

[Our Newspaper] After the declaration of innocence for Okamura Neiji, the Communist side broadcast a great deal of criticism. In addition, Okamura, along with more than 200 other Japanese war criminals who had been sentenced, was escorted from Shanghai to Sugamo Prison in Tokyo on the 28th of last month, causing even more discussion from the outside world. Shi Meiyu, the presiding judge of the military tribunal, specially met with reporters yesterday to issue a statement, saying: This court is ordered to try Japanese war criminals, purely based on legal grounds, so those with conclusive evidence of guilt, such as Tani Hisao and Sakai Takashi, have been clearly executed and not tolerated in the slightest. Those who only participated in combat and did not violate international law or the atrocities listed in our country's war criminal trial regulations should be declared innocent according to the law, and they cannot be treated differently because of their status or relationship to show revenge. In this case of Okamura Neiji, although the defendant was the commander-in-chief of the enemy army, he was appointed at a time when Japan was about to surrender. All the major atrocities in the Nanjing Massacre and other war zones occurred before the defendant's tenure and were originally unrelated to the defendant. As for during his tenure, after detailed investigation by this court, no atrocities for which he should be responsible were found. Therefore, after a joint trial, it was deemed that he should be declared innocent according to the law. However, this judgment must be submitted for approval before it can be finalized. This point was clearly declared at the time of the judgment. As for this time, the defendant, along with Takahashi Toyoichi, Katayama Sadao, Yoshida Kensho, Nakayama Ryoichi, Matsuyama Toyoaki, Miyakawa Jōzō, Sakuraba Shirō and seven other defendants who were declared innocent in other cases, and 253 convicted criminals such as Isogai Rensuke, were temporarily escorted to Sugamo Prison in Japan due to the proximity of the Jinghu-Kunming war zone and as an emergency measure to evacuate the prison. War criminals are common war criminals of the Allied nations, and Tokyo is a safe area under the jurisdiction of the Allied nations, so evacuating and transferring them is not the same as releasing them. Moreover, the above-mentioned cases of innocence have not yet been approved by the Supreme Commander. If a retrial is issued, the criminals should still be escorted back to China for retrial, which our delegation in Japan can definitely accomplish.

### Ticket Booth of French Tramway Company in Xieqiao Smashed; Five Injured; Vehicles on All Routes Temporarily Stop Operating

[Our Newspaper] At 5:25 PM yesterday, the ticket booth of the French Tramway and Public Bus Company station in Xieqiao, Nanshi, was suddenly smashed by more than 50 people in uniform. The 43rd ticket seller, 17th ticket inspector, and 399th, 409th, and 648th ticket sellers, who were working in the booth, were dragged out and beaten severely, causing them to be seriously injured and fall to the ground. The perpetrators then dispersed in a crowd. When the vehicle employees saw this, they immediately reported to the union and the responsible police branch, and sent the injured to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At the same time, all the French trams on Route 18, the French buses on Routes 23 and 20, and the buses of the Traffic Company of the Municipal Public Utility Bureau on Route 20, which were running on the machine, were successively suspended. The French employees demanded that the perpetrators be punished, that the medical expenses of the injured be compensated, and that the safety of their work be guaranteed in the future. After negotiations with relevant parties by Xu Bingshan, a representative of the industry union, an agreement was reached at about 7 o'clock on the payment of medical expenses, so the trolleybuses on Route 18 and the buses on Route 23 resumed operation at 8 o'clock. However, the buses on Route 20 only drove back to the factory because no definite statement was received on the punishment of the perpetrators and the guarantee of safety, and are waiting for a solution today.

[Further News] According to nearby eyewitnesses, the incident was caused by a misunderstanding between a uniformed person and a ticket seller at the Route 20 bus station of the Traffic Company at around 2 PM yesterday over a bus ride. The uniformed person then quickly left. At 5:25 PM, they gathered their companions and returned. Mistaking the French Company's ticket booth for the same system, they smashed it without asking questions and beat up five staff members in the booth.

### Bodies of Two Sunken Ships May Have Drifted Away; Families of Victims Handle Aftermath; Charter Plane Reconnaissance Yields Nothing

[Our Newspaper] After the sinking of the Taiping and Jianyuan Wheels, the families of the victims have organized an office in the China United Company to register according to the class of the passenger cabin. Eleven family representatives from Taiwan have also come to Shanghai to actively plan for the salvage and demand for compensation and other aftermath matters together with the Shanghai representatives. Yesterday, the families chartered a plane at their own expense to fly to the islands near the scene of the accident for reconnaissance, but the results were still fruitless, and the "Haichuan" Wheel stationed on the sea surface also had no specific report. According to observations from all sides, the sinking of the two Wheels this time was a complete capsize, and all passengers and crew members were concentrated on the top floor at the time, rather than being confined in the cabin, so the bodies may have drifted away in all directions, making the salvage work very difficult. Moreover, the exact location of the sinking of the two ships has not been accurately determined by any party so far, and the survey work cannot be started. If there were still those who escaped danger at the time and had reached the nearby deserted islands, the consequences of starvation and cold over the past week would be hard to imagine. It is also said that Chen Zhengyu, a former special correspondent for this newspaper in Fuzhou, was among the passengers who died in the Taiping Wheel disaster. Mr. Chen was on the Wheel to spend the New Year in Taiwan. Unexpectedly, he was selected for the tragic disaster. Now his younger brother, Chen Shoulian, has rushed to Shanghai to handle the aftermath.

According to the China Xinglun Steamship Company, the passenger said in the report that a giant wheel sailed past after the accident, but did not come to rescue, and that the wheel seemed to be the China Xinglun, which is not true. At that time, the position of the China Xinglun was far away from the scene of the Taiping accident by more than 110 nautical miles.

From the start, Lan You's defense was weak and full of openings, which Gong Jiao exploited with aggressive attacks, consistently taking the lead. At halftime, Gong Jiao led with a score of 28 to 14. After switching sides, Lan You improved their organization and the game became closer, but their initial deficit was too large and time was limited. By the end of the match, Lan You was eliminated with a score of 59 to 42.

The subsequent match was between Tian Zhang and He Zhong, refereed by Liu Hesheng and Di Xianzhang. He Zhong demonstrated superior skill and immediately took the lead. Tian Zhang's defense was ineffective. At halftime, He Zhong led with 23 points to Tian Zhang's 14, a difference of nine points. After the break, He Zhong's players continued to be active, and their score climbed steadily. Tian Zhang fought hard, but their gains were insufficient. In the end, He Zhong won with a score of 41 to 26, advancing to the next round.

### Winter Vacation Nears End: Student Aid Must Be Timely; Hope for Generous Donations to Reach Target

The Lunar New Year came and went in a flash. We recall that in the days leading up to New Year's Eve, we earnestly appealed to readers to economize during the holiday and donate the savings to student aid, helping impoverished youth avoid dropping out of school.

As of yesterday, we have not received a substantial donation. With the winter vacation drawing to a close, countless poor students are eagerly awaiting our assistance. Kind-hearted readers, if you sympathize with these students, now is an opportune time to donate funds for rice purchases. Here is a brief report:

On January 27th, with donations totaling $28.80 (including the previous balance), we purchased 18 shi of Zhongbai rice at a market price of $1600 per shi.

On January 28th, with donations totaling $9.60, we purchased 4 shi at a market price of $2400 per shi.

On February 2nd, we purchased 2.5 shi at a market price of $4500, totaling $11.25. (Detailed accounts will be available in tomorrow's social services section.)

In recent days, prices have been rising at an alarming rate. If we do not take measures to purchase and store rice, our entire plan will be in jeopardy when school starts. Therefore, we promptly purchase and store rice as soon as we receive donations. Finally, we hope that readers will continue to donate, so that the student aid fund can reach its intended target soon.

### Brandy at $10,000 a Bottle: Post-Spring Festival Prices Alarming; After Welcoming the God of Wealth, Most Stores Still Half-Closed

[Report from this newspaper] After the Spring Festival, prices are like a spring dream; when you wake up, everything has changed. Among them, black market gold and silver have risen the most fiercely. The silver coins that could be heard clinking everywhere in the alleys have jumped three times in the five days of the Spring Festival. Most other things to eat and wear have risen by one to two times. According to custom, stores should have opened for business yesterday after eating the God of Wealth the night before, but strolling through the streets, only half of the stores were open. Those that were open had their doors half-closed, with only a few goods sparsely displayed in the windows, as if they were reluctant to sell them.

The four major public utilities opened for business yesterday, but they were sparsely attended. Everyone admired the new high prices of various goods with a curious expression. A pair of short children's cotton socks was priced at $140. The most basic men's shirts cost at least $900 each. Small towels cost about $200 each. Most of the biscuits in the confectionery section were already gone, with only the salted soda crackers left, priced at $240 per pound. Sausages were affected by the soaring meat prices, costing $640 per catty. Good mushrooms cost $2,000 per catty. Other luxury goods such as tobacco and alcohol were even more shockingly priced. A bottle of high-end brandy was priced at $10,000. A flat box of 25 Cuban or Manila cigars was priced at $8,800. A gentleman's Haden felt hat was priced at $13,000. Furthermore, the otter fur coats worn by ladies and wives cost $320,000 each at Hongxiang Company. To order one, you had to pay the full price in advance. The clerks in the company said, "There's no way around it, the prices fluctuate every day."

The prices of rice and vegetables, which are of most concern to citizens, were simply in a state of unprecedented anarchic chaos during the Spring Festival. Yesterday, premium rice opened at around $4,300 to $4,400. However, during the Spring Festival, rice shops were asking for as much as $6,000 to $7,000. Many rice shops were still not open yesterday, and even those that followed the opening price had already risen by two times compared to New Year's Eve.

Pork and Mutton Soar; Cabbage is Highly Valued

Although the prices of vegetables varied in different vegetable markets, the trend was consistently upward. Pork and beef rose the most. For example, pork was priced as high as $400 per catty the day before yesterday, with retail lean meat priced from $300 to $360 per catty. Yesterday, prices recovered slightly, from $280 to $320 per catty. Beef remained at the $300 mark per catty. Chicken was priced from $240 to $300 per catty, depending on the leanness. Egg prices also doubled, from $80 per catty on New Year's Eve to $220 per catty yesterday. Wholesale egg shops sold large eggs for $22 to $25 each, but street vendors were selling them for $40 each. Other items included fresh shrimp at $360 per catty, grass carp at $10 per catty, and green fish at $15 per catty.

Among the vegetables, cabbage was highly valued at $40 per catty. However, during the Spring Festival, Tacco cabbage was priced at $35 per catty. Yesterday, the market stabilized, and small pond vegetables, Tacco cabbage, spinach, and Xue Li Hong were priced from $15 to $20 per catty. Yellow bean sprouts cost $25. Tofu cost $20 per square, potatoes cost $30 per catty, and tomatoes cost $80 per catty.

A Long Snake Line is Seen Again in Front of the Zhong Fang Company

Other daily necessities such as fuel, cotton cloth, cigarettes, soap, galoshes, and sneakers all increased in price. Coal briquettes were adjusted to $900 per load yesterday, a twofold increase. The Texas Oil Company's kerosene was priced at $3,000 per can (5 gallons), a more than twofold increase. Fine Longtou cloth was priced at $5,000 per bolt, and a long snake line appeared again at the second sales department of Zhong Fang. Soap cost $60 to $70 per bar. Yuanbao-style galoshes cost $400 to $500 per pair. Long galoshes cost $2,000 per pair, and basketball shoes cost $800 to $900 per pair. Even the spiritual food of the masses—newspapers—still maintained their old price of about $5 per copy, but street vendors were charging $10 per copy.

With such prices, merchants still spoke eloquently, believing that the prices of goods were not rising in proportion to the prices of gold and silver, and always feeling that the goods in their hands were particularly cheap. However, in the eyes of the average citizen, these unprecedentedly high-priced goods could only be appreciated as decorations!

### Shanghai's Spring Market Soars 150%; Authorities to Dump Materials Today; Gold Control Bureau to Crack Down on Gold and Cash Black Market

[Report from this newspaper] After the market opened yesterday after the New Year holiday, prices were stable in the morning because merchants were concerned that the authorities would dump a large number of materials. At noon, however, dumping was seen in practice, causing prices to rise sharply. By the time the market closed in the evening, prices had risen by more than 150% compared to when the market closed last year. According to the observation of people concerned, the main reason for the surge in prices this New Year was the tense situation, so the price increase was across the board. The rise in prices was seen in various places, including Hankou, Chongqing and Guangzhou, and was not limited to Shanghai alone, especially in Tianjin, where prices were more than twice as high as in this city. It is estimated that there is currently over 10 billion in floating capital concentrated in Shanghai. The creator of this amount of floating capital is the unlimited inflationary policy. The issuance of new banknotes is concentrated in Shanghai, and the area where gold yuan notes are circulating is decreasing daily. Major cities such as Beiping and Tianjin have been "liberated", and silver dollar transactions are popular in various provinces and cities in Central China. Gold yuan notes have been expelled, so each new issue is only active in Shanghai. In terms of dumping materials, the authorities only dumped a small amount of sugar yesterday, which was a small amount. The authorities in charge of food said that it would be dumped when necessary. The sale of gauze was discussed at a meeting of the Textile Construction Corporation yesterday, and a decision was made. The company will only take action when the price increase is fierce. The application procedures for various items from the Material Supply Bureau take time. In summary, the authorities have adopted a realistic policy regarding the dumping of materials, that is, to recognize the market price and dump them at high prices, rather than dumping them at prices far below the market price, so as to consume materials and still be unable to stabilize prices in the end. It is heard that the authorities have decided to dump a large number of materials starting today to combat speculation; at the same time, the Gold Control Bureau will take coordinated action to crack down on black market gold and cash transactions.

### Rice Prices Soar

Northern Market Special Rice $4,600; Flour, Grain and Oil Cakes Increase by More Than 100%

The rice market opened high yesterday, due to the sharp rise in prices of various goods in the industry during the New Year holiday, and the already high prices outside the market, resulting in a sharp increase of more than 150% compared to last year. White rice in the Northern Market cost $4,400, a sharp increase of $2,800 compared to the closing price last year. Thin rice was $4,300, early rice was $3,900, and special high rice was $4,600, all with sharp increases of $2,600 to $2,700. The Southern Market opened higher, and the market later softened. White rice closed at $4,200, and early rice initially cost $4,000, closing at $3,900, each with an increase of $2,500 to $2,600. There were very few goods arriving yesterday, with a total of 3,221 stones in the two markets.

Flour

Prices jumped 100% due to strong fluctuations in various goods during the New Year holiday, and people were generally optimistic. The initial market opened with a large distribution at $1,350, and then the military ship was traded at $1,400. The old car initially opened at $1,450, and the cargo owner in the middle of the market raised the price, once shouting to do $1,500. After persuasion by a person in charge of the market, people's hearts calmed down, and the market was not seen to open. The prices of Hongfeng and Jiancheng all increased by 100%. Bran was firm first and then returned, and Fuxin's large package was traded at $1,100 near closing.

Grains

The market opened with a fierce surge in prices. Due to the unstable situation and the sharp reduction in goods from the producing areas, the market could not meet the demand. Soybeans rose the most sharply, with oil factories absorbing a lot. Hankou's Zhadou quickly rose by $1,000, and was traded at $1,900. Later, the holders held on, and the asking price broke through the $2,000 mark, but there was no formal transaction. Che Dou was made for $2,400 yesterday, and the asking price was $2,500 at the close. Raw peanuts also rose more than 100%, and sesame, corn, and red grain all rose by about 100%.

Cooking Oil

The market opened for trading yesterday, and prices rose sharply. Because other items had risen sharply during the New Year holiday, prices also rose sharply. Although exports were temporarily suspended, prices rose sharply due to the small amount of inventory and the scarcity of goods. Soybean oil closed at $18,000, raw oil reached $20,000, and raw vegetable oil closed at $1,600, each with a sharp increase of 200% compared to the closing price last year. Soybean cake closed at $1,400, but still could not be bought.

### Cooking Oil and Its Raw Materials Temporarily Banned from Export

According to Jianghai Customs, cooking oil and its raw materials have been ordered to be temporarily suspended from export or re-export from Shanghai from now on.

### Monetary Policy Eases; Cash Funds Abundant

Yesterday was the first day of the New Year market, and the markets in various industries in the city have resumed operations. After a short break for several days, business is booming. The floating capital accumulated by various parties around the end of the year has flowed into the market in large quantities, resulting in an unusually loose monetary policy. The highest secret interest rate in the market was $40, but mostly between $30 and $35. The government has plans to dump materials and withdraw monetary policy, so people are quite wary. However, it is generally believed that there is too much capital in the city, and it is extremely difficult to withdraw it for a while.

Cash funds were very abundant yesterday, and the banknotes that had been dispersed among the people before the year were returning in large quantities. The counters of the banking houses were unusually busy, which was rare in recent times. There are no longer any restrictions on withdrawals, and the phenomenon of discounts has completely disappeared.

### Tung Oil Asking Price Soars

The tung oil market yesterday: The association's listed price was not opened until the afternoon, and the asking prices of the same industry were soaring because the sharp increase in prices of the eight major public utilities affected the cost greatly, so they all followed the soaring prices. Full-sized white oil and genuine Xihong reached $12,000, and the rest, such as deputy Xihong and Qing oil, all increased by about 200% compared to Lunar New Year's Eve. Transactions lacked actual value, and generally had to be returned to normal today to open the market.

### Tea Market Process Calm

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the tea market was still as quiet as water, because there was a shortage of tea in stock, and the prices of goods outside the market had skyrocketed, so those who held the goods were unwilling to give up, and they were reluctant to give up on various varieties. However, no transactions were seen, and the process ended quietly. According to the current situation, the tea market will definitely become more and more prosperous.

### Silk Rises More Than 100%

Man-made silk opened high yesterday, and the market rose sharply. After the market opened, the money in the market became more relaxed, and buying was extremely strong. No. 120 Tianqiao opened at $155,000 and shouted, but later, due to the soaring black market price of gold, people were restless, and the table was re-raised, and the rise was very strong. The asking price soared to $185,000, and the trend was still strong at the close, and the appetite was not weak. As a result, it was $5,000 better. More than 100% higher than the Lunar New Year.

Because the exchange transfer certificate rose, the shouting prices of various items outside the market were chaotic and the rise was unclear during the closure of the market, so people were also stimulated. After the premium retail market opened high yesterday, the market rose all the way, and the asking price approached the peak of $210,000. Afterwards, the rise was too violent, and the appetite turned sluggish. At noon, it recovered slightly by $20,000, but it also rose sharply by more than 100%.

The cloth market opened high and closed low yesterday. Initially, the money was very loose and people were firm. The Meiya quilt surface was opened at $138,000, a high price, and the transactions were frequent. The selling trend was still strong, and the table was mostly watching. The price fell back and hovered around $115,000. Near noon, various items outside the industry rose together, and the market stood firm. Until the close, there was no significant rise or fall.

Man-made Silk Listed Price Decided

The Central Trust Bureau held a man-made silk meeting yesterday and decided that the price of man-made silk from January 31 to February 5 would be 152,000 yuan per box of Italian goods No. 120 Grade 3 with light.

Woolens Rise Sharply

Yesterday, both buyers and sellers of woolens and the market opened for business. Hongxiang flannelette opened at $3,600 per yard, Zhanghua flannelette $3,500, No. 55 and Shuangmao brand medium-thick Serge opened at $2,800, and Yinfeng Huada tweed $3,000. Compared with the closing prices of old stocks, the average increase was more than 50%. Although there were many red flags, the reality was not so. Because only the prices were mutually consulted, there were no importers. It was found that the high opening of this market was not related to the cost of woolen production and sales, but was completely driven by the general price of goods.

Wood is Stable

The wood market is about 150% higher than last spring. The actual sales have not moved, and business must be after the Lantern Festival. However, there has been a large purchase of fir in recent days, so the market is still stable.

### Cotton Yarn Trend Vague; Cloth Market Rises Sharply

Cotton Yarn Prices opened. The closing prices of both coarse and fine yarns fell. Although there was talk of a sale by the authorities, no sales were seen on the market yesterday, so people raised prices and the market turned sharply for the better.

The blue Phoenix 42 was initially called $165,000, and the purchasers were very indifferent due to concerns about sales by the authorities, and the market was soft. Later, the American Aid Association did not list prices for sale yesterday, and the buying trend in the market suddenly arose, and the price was shouted up to $210,000 in an instant.

The price of Shuangwei 21 was initially called $120,000, and velvet was traded at $115,000. In the middle of the transaction, the staff member came to the market and was about to start listing prices, and the people's hearts softened, and the buying was very light. The price was called $110,000, but no one asked. Afterwards, the yarn dumping work was delayed and not started, so the market changed sharply and the price rose. Today, the price was $142,000 at the close.

The cloth market yesterday rose sharply. Prices of all commodities rose sharply, and the market continued the asking price of the previous tea party. The market opened at a high price. Although there was talk of restricting the transportation of cloth to the south again, the prices of all commodities have been boosted sharply, and the market is booming. The four gentlemen opened at $4,200 and the price rose and stabilized, rising to $4,900, and the price returned slightly to $4,750 at the noon closing. Fine Longtou cloth hovered around the $5,000 mark, and medium-grade fine cloth, trumpet boys and Longtou B fine cloth, all closed at $4,200. Da Shuanglong fine cloth rose from $3,850 to $4,100, and Shifeng Tower Yuan Serge was made for $4,500, which was about 150% stronger than the market price before the close. Selin cloth hit the $10,000 mark, and private factories have adjusted prices one after another. There are not many who have opened, and the people are determined and the trend is bullish.

China Textile Sales Yarn

[Report from this newspaper] The Textile Construction Corporation sold yarn for the first time after the New Year yesterday, opening a total of 14 types. As a result, 28 households were approved to purchase, and 53 pieces were approved to purchase, with a value of 9,314,000 yuan.

The opening prices of each type of yarn included Red Moon 16 count at 95,000 yuan, Yang He 32 count at 152,000 yuan, Shuanggu Fengnian 32 count at 180,000 yuan, Red Real Light 40 count at 166,000 yuan, TK Sunlight 40 count at 285,000 yuan, Shuanggu Hong Lida 42 count at 185,000 yuan, and Gong Nü 60 count at 285,000 yuan.

In addition, the company did not sell yarn on behalf of the National Bank, etc. yesterday. It is said that after observing the market dynamics, it was considered that there was no need to dump yesterday.

### Last Week's Retail Price Index is 294 Times Higher than Before the War

### Business Briefs

Cigarettes: The trading of "Red Plate" cigarettes was brisk, with prices soaring uniformly. Each grade has risen approximately twofold compared to before the Lunar New Year.
