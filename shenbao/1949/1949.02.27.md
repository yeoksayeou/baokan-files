Tang Enbo's Interview with Foreign Reporters

[United Press, This City] General Tang Enbo believes that Chiang Kai-shek has completely abandoned China's military and political affairs. Tang told United Press reporters on the 26th that rumors that Chiang Kai-shek is still "commanding affairs" through daily contact with military and administrative officials are incorrect and unfounded. At the same time, General Tang pointed out that there may be some basis for believing that President Chiang has not completely retired in some respects, but Tang emphasized that this is not due to President Chiang's personal actions, but due to some of his subordinates. Some of President Chiang's subordinates may maintain contact with some parties in Nanjing to stay informed.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] It is reported that Zhang Qi's unit of a certain division of the National Army, which crossed the river and surrendered to the Communist Army, was recently transferred to the vicinity of Wuwei, where they were completely disarmed by the Communist Army, and their food supply was insufficient.

### The National Army Has No Intention of Destroying the Tunnels and Bridges on the Pinghan Railway

The CCP Radio Broadcast Is a Misrepresentation

[Our Newspaper, Xinyang, 26th] The statement, broadcast three times by the CCP, that "the National Army will destroy the Wushengguan Tunnel (173 kilometers south of Xinyang to Hankou) and the Changtaiguan Huaihe River Bridge (329 kilometers north of Xinyang to Hankou) on the Pinghan Railway" is now reported by the railway authorities to be a misrepresentation. About a week ago, a small team of National Army engineers was active on the Huaihe River Bridge, trying to take defensive measures in case of emergency, but they left immediately. As for Wushengguan, no explosives have ever been planted there, because there is no need for it at present, and it will not be done in the future.

### President Sun Advocates Continuing Military Reduction; The Key to Stabilizing Prices Lies in Whether There Can Be Peace; The Balance of Power Between the Central and Local Governments Must Be Promoted to Realize It

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 26th] Premier of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, said at a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters at 11 AM on the 26th that the new financial and economic reform plan has been announced, but some important issues related to financial improvement are still under active discussion, such as: (1) The issue of military reform. The original National Army had 6.3 million people, which was later reduced to 5 million, and finally decided to reduce to 4.2 million. However, this number is still difficult to bear given the current financial situation. Therefore, reducing the army and saving military expenditure is an urgent matter. What is currently under discussion is the issue of military service reform. Some people advocate abolishing the conscription system and changing it to a voluntary system, but it needs to be studied in detail before a decision can be made. (2) The new financial and economic plan is only a temporary measure to stabilize prices, but to cure the root cause, there are still many problems that are being actively discussed and gradually implemented. Whether the current price fluctuations and inflation can be curbed depends on whether there can be peace. If peace is hopeless, there will naturally be greater difficulties. However, both sides have now expressed their intention to negotiate. Although no reports have been received on the progress of Shao Lizi and others, he believes that the prospects for peace must be very optimistic. On this trip south by President Li, preliminary decisions have been made on the above-mentioned important issues, especially on the issue of conducting peace talks. Sun also immediately stated that he would go to Nanjing in a day or two to discuss in detail with all parties again.

### If the Legislative Yuan Resumes in Nanjing, Sun Will Attend to Report

As for the issue of the Executive Yuan moving back to Nanjing, no decision has been made yet, because peace has not yet reached a suitable time. In response to reporters' inquiries, he finally said: (1) The accusation against Minister Liu Weichi for corruption is a rumor and is currently under investigation. (2) He has not yet seen Liu's letter asking him to resign and cannot answer. (3) If it is determined that the Legislative Yuan will resume in Nanjing, he will attend to report. (4) The Executive Yuan's move to Guangzhou was with the consent of Acting President Li and was not done without authorization. (5) Wu Yuhao and others went to Beiping purely out of their own initiative. The Executive Yuan did provide them with hospitality expenses, but they cannot represent the government or himself. (6) He (Sun) does not advocate that the Legislative Yuan hold meetings in both Nanjing and Guangzhou at the same time. He believes that if this is the case, it would be an unfortunate event. (7) If a decision is made on military reform, military construction will be stopped. Even if the peace talks break down, he personally still advocates continuing military reduction, otherwise there will be no way to improve the treatment of soldiers.

### Hope to Improve the Treatment of Civil Servants Starting This Month

(8) The treatment of civil servants will be paid according to the cost of living index in various places in the current month, which is much better than before. He hopes to implement it starting in February, but it still needs to be approved by the Ministry of Finance before a decision can be made. (9) Regarding political reform, he believes that the past centralization of power was unwise. The powers of the central and local governments should be divided. The constitution also stipulates that the central and local governments should have balanced power, and it must be promoted to realize it. Except for certain areas that belong to the central government, such as justice and national defense, other local facilities should be implemented by the local government after being approved by the legislative body of public opinion. The central government should not interfere in order to realize democratic politics. The announcement of the new financial and economic reform plan is to start this trend. Starting from the next grain year, the 30% of the land tax originally paid to the central government has been allocated to the local government. This can make local funding abundant, and military construction can reduce the burden on the people.

### Congressional Figures from Silver-Producing States in the United States Are Paying Attention to Our Use of Silver Coins; Officials of the International Monetary Fund Are Not Commenting

[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] Officials of the International Monetary Fund are avoiding criticism of our country's fiscal and financial reform plan announced yesterday before receiving formal notification. Since our government has once again cast and issued silver dollars, financial circles here generally speculate that China is requesting silver assistance from the United States. IMF officials expressed considerable surprise at China's action and expect to receive formal notification from our government soon. It is reported that our government did not consult with the IMF on this reform, which is not necessary. Congressional figures representing silver-producing states in the United States are paying attention to our country's restoration of free trade in silver and the use of silver coins. Senator McCarran, who proposed lending $1.5 billion to China, said that China's adoption of silver measures is suitable for his previous proposal to buy and sell silver for $500 to $700 million to stabilize the currency system, but his proposed bill did not specifically specify this point. Senators and representatives from silver-producing states are willing to sell silver at a so-called legal price of 29 cents per ounce, but the US Treasury Department buys newly mined silver at a price of 90.5 cents, while the market price is about 70 cents.

### Construction Funds Have Not Been Used, No New US Aid Has Been Contacted

(10) The Sino-Soviet Commercial Treaty has already been signed and is still valid. The recent negotiations in Xinjiang are only about the trade between Xinjiang Province and the Soviet Union. Due to problems in Yining and other places two years ago, trade was suspended. Now Xinjiang Province is seeking to resume trade on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and the conditions are under negotiation. (11) Of the $275 million passed by the US Congress last year, more than $70 million is earmarked for construction, but this amount has not been used yet, and how to use it has not been decided. The deadline for use was originally set for April 3, but in principle, it can still be extended at that time. As for new US aid, no contact has been made.

### Changzhou Jailbreak Case

[Taibao, Wujin, 26th] The detention center of the District Court is located under the Xiong City in Sanpailou, a slightly remote place. A new prison was specially built. At 9:30 last night, five plainclothes bandits suddenly arrived. The leader used a gun to call out to guard Pan Guoxing, ordering him to hand over his pistol. Two bandits monitored, while the other three bandits rushed into the bedroom of Warden Huang Weihan, forcing Huang to hand over two pistols and one rifle, along with more than 20 rounds of ammunition and 30,000 gold yuan notes, all of which were looted. They then tied Warden Huang and guards Wang Qinghui and Wu Enze, who were on night duty, and locked them in the security room, cut the telephone line, and forced Chief Guard Guo Fufu to point out the prisoners Wu Jian (30 years old), Huang Ming (30 years old), and Sun Xiaohai (27 years old) (all of whom were sentenced to 15 years in prison for jointly robbing the public office by the Wuxi Command). They opened their fetters and released Cao Liqing, the former Benniu tax director who was sentenced to three years in prison for corruption, Chen Pinzhang, a drug offender sentenced to seven years in prison, Ye Caitan (sentenced to six and a half years in prison), and Jin Fang, a traitor (sentenced to seven years by the Sui District). After releasing the above seven prisoners, they took guard Pan Guoxing with them and fled together. Afterwards, Warden Huang flew to report to the Military Police Corps, which dispatched military police and gendarmerie to leave the city late at night, but found nothing. According to people inside the prison, of the three bandits who entered the prison, two were former prisoners who had been released, one was the traitor Fei Guoxiang (from Wuxing), who was released on January 8, and the other was Ni Defang (from Hutangqiao in this county), who was released in December last year. They were extremely familiar with the prison, so their actions were smooth. After the incident, the whole city was shocked. This morning, a team was sent to guard the prison, and Warden Huang and Chief Guard Guo Fufu, and guard Wang Qinghui were arrested for thorough investigation. The city defense department and the police局 were tightly investigating the case. Ding, who is also the Commander of the Pacification, is paying close attention to this and ordered a strict investigation to solve the case.

### The Beiping World Daily Evening News Was Shut Down by the CCP Authorities

[Our Newspaper] According to a broadcast by the CCP Shaanbei Radio Station, the Beiping World Daily and World Evening News, organized by legislator Cheng Shewo, were shut down by the CCP Military Control Commission on the 25th. The reason for the shutdown was that "this newspaper harbored a hostile attitude towards the cause of people's liberation." The CCP referred to Cheng Shewo as a "KMT CC element" and said that the two newspapers had "obvious evil deeds." It is reported that the newspaper had the largest circulation in Beiping. Note: Cheng had already left Beiping and came south before Beiping changed hands and is currently in Shanghai.

[United Press, Beiping, 25th] Before Beiping was besieged, there were more than 20 daily newspapers. There were still 12 newspapers at the time of "liberation." Now there are only two newspapers left, Xinmin Daily and People's Daily. The People's Daily was established after the liberation, so the only original newspaper left is Xinmin Daily.

[Another Telegram] The Telecommunications Bureau announced that starting today, reporters must pay cash for telegrams. Reporters whose press passes have expired are only allowed to send telegrams at ordinary telegram rates. Ordinary telegrams are four times more expensive than news telegrams. The Telecommunications Bureau does not allow reconsideration.

### The Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu Is Rushing to Build a Large Number of Wooden Boats; Preparations for Crossing the River Are Becoming More Active; The Highway Between Taixian and Jingjiang Has Been Repaired

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The Communist Army in Jiangbei is becoming increasingly active in preparing to cross the river. In Yangzhou alone, it is said that they plan to build 2,000 wooden boats, some of which are equipped with car motors or engines dismantled from diesel-powered rice mills. They have also requisitioned more than 20,000 pieces of wood from various places to build a large number of wooden boats. In addition, the highway between Taixian and Jingjiang has been repaired, and the highway between Taixian and Rugao is being rushed to repair.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] More than a thousand local bandits in the southeast of Longtan, Liuhuo, crossed the river and harassed Donggou and its vicinity on the 22nd. After the National Army on the Dahekou Bridgehead counterattacked, the Communist Army retreated to Liuhuo City.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 26th] The Jiangsu Provincial Security Department today announced the movements of the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu: (1) The sixteen columns of the Communist Army's field troops are actively reorganizing and replenishing in various parts of northern Jiangsu. (2) The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Regiments of the 1st Military Sub-district of the Communist Army and the Taixian Independent Regiment infiltrated the area of Diaojiapu, Dasizhuang, and Tangwan on the 16th of this month, actively rushing to repair the Liangtai Highway. (3) The Communist Army in northern Jiangsu seems to be still preparing to cross the river. Rice mills and various types of diesel engines in counties such as Dongtai and Xinghua have all been requisitioned to convert civilian ships. More than 300 sailboats are gathered near Gaoyou and Baoying Lake. Shipbuilding is also being actively carried out in Nantong and Tiensheng Harbor.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 26th] It is reported that the Communist Army in Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui has recently launched a campaign for women to rush to make 3 million pairs of military shoes. 1 million pairs are being made in northern Jiangsu alone, with a deadline of one month.

It is reported that after the training is completed, they will be sent to the Jiangnan area to do underground work. In addition, more than 1,000 public and educational personnel from Rugao have been sent to Dongtai for training.

### The Soviet Consulate in Beiping Quietly Stopped Working; The Soviet Consul and Staff Are Still in Beiping

[United Press, Beiping, 26th] The Soviet Consulate here quietly stopped working a week ago, but Consul Tichvinsky and other staff are still in Beiping. The reason for the Soviet Union's move is unclear. It is generally believed that the Soviet side wants to show that it has no relationship with the CCP. Another theory is that the Soviet Union anticipates that the CCP will establish a temporary Chinese government in Beiping. If the Soviet Union does not recognize it, Soviet officials should not stay in Beiping, but this theory cannot be confirmed. Tichvinsky did not participate in the recent consular corps meeting convened by French Consul Ballereau. Tichvinsky also did not appear at the Washington's Birthday Memorial Dance on the 22nd of this month, but other consuls all participated. The Communist side announced the exchange of car licenses, but did not stipulate how foreigners should obtain licenses. Tichvinsky was among the first foreigners to stop using cars. The bronze plate outside the Soviet Consulate was removed a week ago, causing general doubts, but the Soviet Consul and other staff of the consulate did not want to explain the reason. Later, Soviet nationals went to the consulate to exchange passports and discuss other matters, only to find that it had stopped working.

[Another Telegram] The situation outside the consulates of various countries has eased. CCP guards allow people to enter and exit freely, and do not prohibit people from carrying packages, nor do they force people to get out of the car and walk.

### The People's Peace Terms

— Meng Gongliang

Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have always claimed to represent the people and have loudly proclaimed the implementation of democracy. In this wave of peace movements, both sides have put forward conditions. These conditions can be said to be the conditions of both parties, or the conditions representing the people. However, the peace terms in the minds of the people must not be fully encompassed by the above-mentioned conditions. Therefore, in addition to the conditions they have put forward, both parties should humbly accept the conditions put forward by the people as the highest principle of peace, which is a manifestation of democracy. If reasonable conditions of the people are ignored altogether, and everyone thinks they are the only one that matters, demanding the people to regard their proposed conditions as imperial edicts, golden rules and jade laws, then that is too undemocratic.

I am the most ordinary Chinese person, without power or courage, without rights or influence. I am willing, in good conscience, to put forward two conditions that I believe will be supported by the vast majority of the people. I urge the people of the whole country to criticize and discuss them and give them their support. At the same time, I urge those who are engaged in the peace movement, whether in power or out of power, to include these two conditions in the scope of "peace talks" as the people's conditions.

These two conditions are:

(1) After the cessation of domestic war, a national thirty-year construction plan must be implemented, that is, six consecutive five-year construction plans: in this construction plan, livelihood construction should account for more than 60% of the achievements.

(2) During the implementation of the national thirty-year construction plan, under any difficult circumstances, civil war must not occur, and participation in world wars is even more forbidden.

The first condition mentioned above can of course unconditionally win the support of the whole country. As for the first condition, some people may ask: "Aren't wars forced by the enemy? For self-defense, are we not allowed to have wars?" I want to solemnly tell all parties in power: Chinese people, except those with special status, all resent war. However, the ability to control political power varies, and the public's expression of anti-war sentiment also varies. I have always been among the people and deeply know that the public's hatred of war and fear of war emerge anytime and anywhere, and cannot be suppressed. Therefore, I advise you, gentlemen, not to be complacent about military achievements, but to listen more to the opinions of the people and be considerate of the people's wishes.

The rulers of a country, if they sincerely want to avoid war, are not absolutely unable to achieve their goal. For example, Turkey, in World War II, openly received aid from Britain and the United States, and also signed the Anglo-French-Turkish agreement, which made it seem inevitable to participate in the war, but in the end, it did not participate. The establishment of Franco's regime in Spain was entirely due to Germany and Italy, but when World War II broke out, Franco stayed out of the war and did not even bother to recover Gibraltar. It can be seen that as long as the rulers of a country have sincerity and perseverance, and are not seduced or oppressed by external forces, they can indeed avoid war. The above two examples may be insignificant and not worth learning from. Please turn over the history of the Soviet Union's nation-building.

The founder of a political force does not need war even more; because the shock and upheaval of foreign wars can affect the strength of politics and destroy years of hard work. Lenin, the great founder of the Soviet Union, after the success of the revolution, strongly avoided foreign wars despite territorial cuts and encirclement and hostility from the great powers, and devoted all his efforts to internal consolidation. Finally, the grand plans and magnificent achievements of the Soviet Union's construction shone brilliantly. The example is not far away, and I deeply hope that our country will rise up and follow suit, so that China, which has lost the four major construction opportunities of the late Qing Dynasty's reform, the Revolution of 1911, the completion of the Northern Expedition, and the victory in the Anti-Japanese War, can strive for construction after the cessation of civil war, and make the people forget the pain that political reforms have given them in the past century, and taste some of the happiness of the revolution.

Regarding the second condition, a clearer interpretation can be made, that is: if a war breaks out between the Soviet Union and the United States, China will never participate in the war on either side, and China will still proceed with the thirty-year construction program according to the planned procedure. People's representatives must participate in the peace conference, and the people's representatives must solemnly state this point and record it, so that the United States and the Soviet Union will understand China's aspirations and dare to provide bold assistance to China's construction, at least; continuously transport technical personnel, machinery, and raw materials to China or exchange goods to accelerate China's construction. If China's declaration of non-participation in the war gradually eases the tense emotions between the Soviet Union and the United States and eliminates war, it would be our greatest hope and the greatest happiness for all mankind. Unfortunately, if the United States and the Soviet Union engage in a war, China will of course continue construction, and both sides will need Chinese machinery, materials, and raw materials. Trade between the warring countries will definitely become more prosperous, which may be more beneficial to China's construction. However, China's foreign trade must be based on national interests. If one party's barter conditions are more favorable, then that party's transaction can be given priority. This point should be clearly stated at that time to avoid suspicion of partiality from both sides.

It is expected that if a third world war unfortunately cannot be avoided, it will be very cruel. Whoever brings China into the war will be a sinner in the eyes of the people. China has decided not to participate. If foreign forces invade China, it must adhere to the spirit of not participating in the war and use all possible methods to reduce the major events to minor ones, so that it does not lead to a formal war. Many people predict that the next world war will break out closest to the Chinese border. The Chinese government should first declare that no matter which country invades Chinese territory, China will definitely drive it out of the country, but after the invading army withdraws from the country, China will consider the "incident" to have ended. Before and after expelling the invading troops, China will not break off diplomatic relations or declare war on that country, so as to maintain China's attitude of not participating in the war. The above is just my personal assumption, but I firmly believe that it will be supported by the people of the whole country. During World War II, Turkey and Spain maintained their neutrality by adhering to their attitude of not participating in the war. If China adheres to the principle of not participating in the war and announces this belief to the world, we can believe that the warring parties will respect China's opinions and will not infringe upon China's neutrality.

Not participating in a world war is the wish of the Chinese people and the urgent need of the Chinese nation. Western culture has been introduced into China for nearly a century. The Chinese people hoped that it would bring some happiness, but this goal has not been achieved. Instead, they have suffered a century of civilized disasters! Please, gentlemen, show your loyalty to the country! Build the country for thirty years, and do not participate in any world war during the thirty-year construction period. This is beneficial to the regime itself, the Chinese people, and all of humanity, and there is no harm.

Peace must be thorough, and the people's peace conditions must be placed first!

### The Chinese Communist Party Plans to Take Over Hong Kong; Hong Fang Will Rely on Our Government for Support

[French News Agency, Hong Kong, 26th] Although Chinese Communist leaders have not made any definite statements to the Hong Kong government regarding the Hong Kong issue, it is rumored that they have hinted that the CCP currently does not intend to make any demands on Hong Kong. According to reliable sources, the semi-official representative of the CCP in Hong Kong has assured the British authorities that the CCP authorities do not intend to launch any public movements to demand a solution to the Hong Kong issue, nor do they intend to support any covert operations (such as strikes) to undermine this prosperous commercial port. The source also stated that although the Communist Party reserves full freedom of action at an appropriate time in the future, they hope that the Hong Kong issue will be resolved through diplomatic channels. This issue has attracted considerable attention from the Hong Kong and London British authorities, because the takeover of Hong Kong, although currently a theoretical issue, may become a de facto issue this year. Hong Kong, whether internally or externally, is vulnerable to attack and must rely on the support of the Chinese government.

### "China's Ernie Pyle" Active on the Central China Front Line

— Special Correspondent Fang Canglang

[Our Newspaper, Xiaogan, 16th] Ernie Pyle was a true American war correspondent. During World War II, he followed the army across the ocean to work in the Southeast Asian war zone. He initially lived with American soldiers and eventually died in action during a landing operation. He has been dead for more than four years, but we are still stuck in the Chinese civil war, neither dead nor alive. Thinking about it, I feel ashamed and pathetic. Therefore, when the Wuhan colleagues group stepped towards the Central China front line, I was happy to follow this group of "China's Ernie Pyles," taking a step forward to emulate Ernie Pyle, who lives eternally in the hearts of the UN soldiers and civilians. Let's see if there is a "people's army" appearing at this time and place to listen to the voices of the people.

Listening to the Voices of the People on the Hunger Line

At ten o'clock in the morning on February 21st, I followed fourteen colleagues from Wuhan, took a special first-class sleeping car on the Pinghan Railway from Hongkou Dazhimen, and happily headed north. It was early in the heavy snow season, and the cold wind was piercing. Fortunately, Chief Zhang Ping from the Railway Bureau, who was taking care of us on the train, Liaison Staff Sui, Commissioner Chen, Section Chief Zhang, and Secretary Zhang, who was sent by the Liang Corps upon hearing the news, provided extra care and warmth. The enthusiastic atmosphere made the train car feel even warmer. Before the train departed, we saw the passengers crammed into the second-class carriages and piled up on the open wagons, shivering in the wind, and expressed our concern. After inquiring with Chief Zhang Ping in detail, we learned about the serious coal shortage of the Pinghan Railway Bureau and could not help but express our sympathy for these passengers running their own businesses. It is pitiful that this Pinghan Railway, which runs north and south across the Chinese mainland for 1,200 kilometers, has only 308 kilometers left (from Hankou to Zhumadian). Due to the coal shortage, the line is short, expenses are high, and income is low, resulting in low salaries, so the locomotives cannot get enough black coal, and the employees cannot get enough white rice, turning it into a cold hunger line. Yet it still has to shoulder the arduous task of military and public transportation. This kind of work ethic is truly rare and should be attributed to Director Xia Guangyu's ability to lead by example. According to the workers on the train, it has been difficult to transport the Pingxiang coal and Yangmei Mountain coal that the railway relies on. Fortunately, the General Planning Office is very concerned about the railway's coal shortage and order, alleviating their pain a little.

People struggling on the hunger line are most concerned about the issue of peace. We heard people from the Communist-controlled areas north of Luohe say that people there are not allowed to talk about peace, which everyone found strange, feeling that the god of peace is still far away from us. In fact, on this hunger line, the distance between the two sides is only 56 kilometers (Zhumadian is 56 kilometers from Luohe, and the Communist-controlled area of Zhengzhou has opened to traffic to Luohe). If a ceasefire could be achieved and the tracks connected, it would not take more than a month to open the line without fighting, and it would be a great thing to "lay down the butcher's knife and become a Buddha on the spot." Tell the warmongers, the wisdom God gave you, the body your parents left you, and the strength you gained from eating, should only be used to kill demons, not to harm living beings!

Walking Through Snow to Hengdian to See Military-Civilian Trade

From Hankou to Hengdian, which belongs to Huangpi County, it is 30 kilometers, and the journey takes one hour. This is our first destination. After we got off the train, we stepped through mud and snow and were invited to attend a tea party held by people from all walks of life in the town to listen to the voices of the people. From the mouths of Township Head Peng and Chairman Lin of the Chamber of Commerce, as well as from the oil and meat rationing certificates purchased by the troops under the Political Work Department, we first understood the origins of the harmonious relationship between the military and civilians in this area. Here, whenever troops from a certain military corps purchase oil, meat, and other items, they must first go to the Political Work Department to obtain purchase certificates according to their actual needs, and then go to the stores with the certificates to purchase goods at preferential prices, about 20% off the market price. This is an enlightened approach that avoids military-civilian disputes. The political work colleagues here have obviously abandoned the outdated style of selling snake oil, and are wholeheartedly engaging in bridge-building work between the military and civilians. The main reason for their success is that officers and soldiers have a better interest in political work, the troops have strict discipline, and the economy of the entire corps, from the headquarters to the companies and platoons, can be made public. Officials do not exploit the soldiers, which is the iron discipline set by General Zhang Gan. Violating this creed means kneeling in front of the soldiers and being shot at as a target.

Hengdian is the third largest town on the Pinghan Line in Huangpi, belonging to Xiaoyou Township, and governs 14 Bao. There are less than 1,000 residents in the town, and the rural population is more than 50,000. Rice and oil are the main agricultural products, and the specialty is cattle and sheep hides. Although the place is close to the Jiangcheng city, the people are still quite honest. Our group left the town at 3 p.m. and took the train to the location of the Corps Headquarters.

### Army Vice Chief of Staff Solemnly Announces: U.S. Determined to Defend the Far East Defense Line; Decision to Maintain 127,000 Troops in the Far East; Troops in Alaska to Be Doubled

[United Press, Washington, 25th] The Department of the Army announced tonight that the United States has decided to maintain the number of troops stationed in the Far East at 127,000, the same as a year ago. The number of troops in Alaska will be doubled. In response to recent rumors that the Army Department intends to reduce the number of troops stationed in the Far East, Army Vice Chief of Staff Collins hosted reporters and reiterated the statement of Secretary of the Army Royal, stating that the United States intends to defend the Far East defense line. When asked by reporters whether the U.S. military in the Far East is responsible for a so-called "strategic mission" and whether it means that it will not hesitate to fight if attacked, Collins replied, "If Japan is attacked and the U.S. military is still stationed there, I can guarantee that the U.S. military will do its duty." When asked by reporters whether 127,000 troops are sufficient, Collins did not answer directly, only saying that the answer depends on many factors. The reporters' questions to Collins focused on the discrepancy in the number of combat troops in the Far East and Europe in the summary of the Army Department's report. Strategic troops account for 88% of all troops stationed in the Far East, while only 72% in Europe. The summary stated, "After the end of the war, MacArthur was ordered to take on the strategic mission of defending Japan. For this reason, MacArthur maintained a strategic organization with the maximum number of combat troops. However, most of these troops are currently used to protect the duties of military institutions in various places and can be immediately mobilized to take on strategic missions in the event of an emergency. General Clark, commander of the U.S. military in Germany, did not have this mission until recently." According to President Truman's budget, the number of U.S. armed forces should not exceed 667,000, of which 258,000 are stationed abroad, which is the same as a year ago. Last November, the number reached 230,000. The distribution of overseas troops for the next fiscal year is as follows:

Far East: Projected 190,000, 130,000 in November last year, 127,000 a year ago.

Alaska: Projected 13,200, 5,991 in November last year, 7,000 a year ago.

Pacific (mainly Hawaii): Projected 7,000, 8,274 in November last year, 9,000 a year ago.

Europe: Projected 92,000, 85,734 in November last year, 96,000 a year ago.

Trieste: Projected 5,000, 4,898 in November last year, 5,000 a year ago.

Caribbean: Projected 14,000, 14,489 in November last year, 14,000 a year ago.

According to this plan, the U.S. military will station five divisions domestically and five divisions abroad, including four divisions in the Far East and one division in Europe, but the strength of each division is not fully staffed.

[United Press, Washington, 25th] U.S. Army Vice Chief of Staff Collins said on the 25th that the United States will reduce the number of troops stationed in Korea and the Philippines. Alaska is the only area where the Army wants to increase troops.

### U.S. Secretary of the Army Royal Says: Soviet Union Unlikely to Attack Japan; He Believes Current Situation is More Relaxed Than a Year Ago

[United Press, Washington, 26th] Secretary of the Army Royal said on the 26th that the U.S. military will rise up and fight if Japan is attacked. At the same time, he believes that the U.S. military will be able to resist the Soviet Union or any country and defend Japan. But he immediately said, "I don't think the Soviet Union will attack Japan. At the same time, I don't think war is imminent. On the contrary, the current world situation is more relaxed than a year ago."

Royal expressed the above views during a question-and-answer broadcast shortly after Army Vice Chief of Staff Collins announced that "the U.S. military will definitely fight if Japan is attacked." Royal said that he "completely agrees" with Collins' statement.

[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] According to diplomatic observers here on the 26th, the United States has taken a stronger stance in Asia than before the "Royal Controversy," and MacArthur's position in Japan has also been strengthened. A diplomat pointed out that in the past, due to differences between officials in Washington and Tokyo, the United States' policy toward Japan was hesitant. However, the statement issued by U.S. Army Vice Chief of Staff Collins in Washington today has clearly pointed out that the U.S. military will rise up and fight if Japan is attacked. Collins' statement has relieved many Japanese people here who were worried that they would be abandoned in distress in the event of war and would be punished by the Communist Party for cooperating with the American occupation forces.

[Our Newspaper] London 26th Broadcast: An outsider said that the conference of nations scheduled to be convened by Nehru on the 28th will discuss whether the Commonwealth countries can assist in resolving the Burmese civil war. British officials revealed that the British government has provided economic assistance to the Burmese government, part of which is for the purchase of military supplies, but officials believe that given the current precarious situation in Burma, economic assistance alone is not enough to solve the problem. British officials believe that at the New Delhi conference, India and Pakistan may suggest taking more direct action.

[United Press, New Delhi, 25th] The Indian government announced today that the five British Commonwealth countries—Britain, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, and Australia—will meet here next Monday to discuss the issue of whether to provide military aid in response to the Burmese civil war.

Australian Foreign Minister Evatt and British Overseas Trade Minister Bottomley have come to New Delhi this week, so the Indian government has proposed "considering the Burmese situation."

[United Press, London, 25th] Foreign Office officials said on the 25th that the New Delhi conference to discuss the Burmese issue is scheduled to be convened on February 28. This conference is a consequence of Burma's request for economic assistance to carry out its anti-communist movement. The official said that Burma made a request for assistance to Britain several weeks ago, and the British government immediately discussed the matter with other Commonwealth countries. As far as we know, this conference will only deal with economic matters. Diplomatic circles say that this New Delhi conference is unlikely to be the prelude to the establishment of an anti-communist agreement by the Commonwealth countries, but the Commonwealth countries are determined to drive communism out of Southeast Asia.

Strong Answers Reporters' Questions After Trial

[United Press, New York, 25th] Pro-Soviet American writer Strong, who was expelled from the Soviet Union for espionage, said on the 25th that he was apparently suspected by "minor Soviet officials" for asking questions as a journalist.

He said that he had never been a spy for any country, and he enthusiastically maintained his American citizenship. When asked if he had ever sworn to renounce his American citizenship, he said, "I am very careful about my nationality. What I am most proud of is the American citizenship my parents gave me." He was accompanied by his lawyer Rogers. Rogers said that Mrs. Strong would give the jury "full cooperation." When asked if he was happy to return to the United States, Mrs. Strong replied, "I like to go anywhere I can sleep. I think America is the most comfortable country we have ever lived in, but not the most touching country. After a period of rest, maybe after a period of writing, I think I will go to a country where there is war." (Note: Strong has expressed his willingness to come to China.)

### Netherlands Advocates Convening Round Table Conference; Indonesia's Response is Not Enthusiastic; United Nations Spokesperson Calls it Irrelevant

[Our Newspaper] New York Broadcast Batavia News: The Indonesian and United Nations sides did not respond enthusiastically to the news that the Netherlands intends to convene a round table conference to discuss the Indonesian issue. A United Nations spokesperson denounced the proposal as empty and irrelevant. Another senior United Nations official criticized the restoration of freedom to the Indonesian Republic leaders, saying that although the Dutch have decided to lift restrictions on the freedom of action of Indonesian leaders, they do not necessarily allow them to return to Yogyakarta or recognize them as government officials. The Indonesian Republic stated that the Dutch statement did not guarantee an independent and autonomous Indonesia in accordance with the United Nations plan. The spokesperson said that if the Republic leaders accept the invitation to participate in the round table conference, the result may be that they will be abandoned to the guerrillas who are currently engaged in combat.

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 26th] The Dutch government issued a communique today stating that the Dutch government has decided to take the initiative to convene a round table conference in The Hague on March 12.

### British Labour Party National Executive Committee Meeting; Drafts Outline of Future Government; Prepares for 1950 Election

[United Press, London, 25th] Prime Minister Attlee and key cabinet members will hold a secret meeting over the weekend. They will decide in a country villa in southern England whether to seek national consent for a plan for comprehensive socialization or to adopt a "gradual" policy. All members of the Labour Party National Executive Committee will participate in the discussion. The weekend meeting, convened by Attlee, will draft the Labour Party's plan for the next five years for the future Labour Party Congress. This plan will form the basis of the Labour Party's platform in the next general election. A fierce struggle will inevitably occur at the meeting between proponents of nationalization, led by Minister of Public Health Bevan, and moderates, including Prime Minister Attlee and Deputy Prime Minister Morrison. According to current indications, the moderates in the cabinet will prevail. Proponents of comprehensive nationalization advocate that shipbuilding, the chemical industry, the insurance industry, sugar and other food production and distribution should all be nationalized. Moderates believe that they have already taken comprehensive nationalization measures, including railways, coal mines, electricity, medicine, and road transport, and are currently promoting a plan for steel nationalization. If this bill is passed by Congress, the Labour Party can declare to voters that they have fulfilled all the guarantees they made to voters in the 1945 election. If the Labour Party wins again, it will focus on consolidating these socialization efforts. They believe that the best winning strategy in the next election will be an attack on prices and a guarantee of improved services for children's well-being.

After Director Cao consulted with Mayor Wu and contacted the Gold Control Bureau, he believed that there was no such thing as reopening or not for the silver shops, and agreed to the request. However, because no central government order has been received yet, if the central government makes any changes to the regulations on the sale and purchase of jewelry in the future, it should be followed.

An executive of a department store said: Yesterday's total door sales were not even enough to purchase food for all the employees, which shows the decline in the purchasing power of the citizens.

### Jiang Tingfu's Reply Regarding Corruption of Foreign Personnel

It was reported in the city's newspapers a few days ago that in a United Press dispatch from New York on the 23rd, Dr. Jiang Tingfu, China's representative to the United Nations, said when speaking to members of the Overseas Press Club that "when he was the Director-General of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), 90% of the 300 foreigners working for him were Americans, and they were more corrupt than the Chinese personnel." American personnel who are still working for the Custodial Committee of the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission were very surprised to read the report, and Colonel An Yanshi, the current Deputy Director of the Fishery Administration, who used to be the Deputy Executive Director of CRRRA, telegraphed to inquire whether Mr. Jiang had made such a statement.

### Order for Collection of Commodity Tax in Kind Not Yet Received; Bureau Says Still Handled According to the Old System

Before the formal order has been received, the tax will still be collected according to the old system. However, it is believed that when the implementation details are issued, they will be followed immediately.

### Mayor's Monthly Salary is Six US Dollars; Low Salaries for Government Employees; Strong Hope for Government to Announce Improvement

[Our Own Report] With the continuous rise in the cost of living, the lives of salaried people are already on the verge of collapse. The gap between the salaries of government employees and the cost of living has become a reality. Before the measures for adjusting the salaries of government employees are decided after the announcement of this new economic plan, reporters made a statistics on the salaries of officials and employees of the Municipal Government for this month. The result showed that Mayor Wu's monthly income is 17,400 yuan, equivalent to 11 yuan and 6 cents in silver coins, which is equivalent to 6 US dollars and 3 cents according to yesterday's market price. In addition, the salaries of other bureau chiefs vary depending on their base salaries, with an average monthly income of more than 16,000 yuan, deputy bureau chiefs an average monthly income of more than 15,000 yuan, and division chiefs about 10,000 yuan. The meager salaries of lower-level employees are evident from this.

The above salary figures are the result of multiplying the base salary by the government employee cost of living index. Those with base salaries above 60 yuan must also be discounted according to the measures announced by the government. Mayor Wu's base salary is 680 yuan, which is only equivalent to 232 yuan after the discount. Multiplying by 75 times the Jinghu area government employee cost of living index announced this month, the result is more than 17,000 yuan. In addition to their due salaries, government employees also receive monthly in-kind allocations, including two coal balls, five dou of rice, three catties of cooking oil, and two and a half catties of salt. If they do not receive in-kind items, they can convert the difference into cash, calculated according to the market price of the day, which is worth about 20,000 yuan. However, due to delays in distribution, it is of little practical benefit. Therefore, as this new economic plan is announced and the government is about to readjust the salaries of government employees, all government employees in Shanghai are eagerly awaiting a reasonable improvement in their lives.

### Scholarship Fundraising Ends; Donation Figures Being Calculated

[Our Own Report] During the City Education Week, the Shanghai, Asia-America, and Victory Radio stations mobilized personnel from the city's entertainment industry to hold an on-air scholarship fundraising broadcast for two days, which ended at 2:00 a.m. this morning. The predetermined goal was 50 million yuan. In order to achieve this goal, the Education Bureau sent letters to all public and private radio stations in the city, requesting their cooperation in suspending other commercial advertising programs on the fundraising day to support the cause and achieve greater results. The Garrison Headquarters Radio Monitoring Section and the Telecommunications Bureau also notified the public and private radio stations accordingly. However, public radio stations such as United, Tiansheng, Shengli, Xinwen, Yuanzheng, Tiefeng, and Xinsu, as well as private radio stations such as Wanchang and Jindu, continued to broadcast their commercial programs as usual on the fundraising day, which greatly affected the scholarship fundraising work. The organizers expressed their regret over this. The detailed figures of the funds raised are still being collected and calculated, so they could not be known yesterday.

### Ministry of Education Personnel Remaining in Shanghai Telegraph Guangzhou for Instructions on Four Points

[Our Own Report] Because Acting Minister Chen telegraphed from Guangzhou, urging members in Shanghai to leave by the end of February and report to the affiliated agencies by March 15, otherwise they would be considered as resigning, without answering the salary issues of the colleagues.

### Fire at Dongbinxing Road Destroys Six Houses

### Tenants' General Federation Posts Slogans Opposing Landlords' Unauthorized Rent Increases; Draft Rent Standard Being Formulated by the Land Administration Bureau

[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Tenants' General Federation posted slogans on the streets yesterday, publicizing opposition to landlords' unauthorized rent increases, opposing rent calculations based on physical gold, foreign currency, or cost of living index, and demanding that the Land Administration Bureau promptly announce rent standards. A reporter visited Shen Zhenjia, the acting director of the Land Administration Bureau yesterday. It is understood that the bureau is widely soliciting opinions from all parties and drafting reasonable standards, preparing to submit them to the municipal council next week, and then send them to the municipal council for discussion and approval before implementation. This draft rent standard will stipulate several calculation methods, which will be selected by the municipal council and the municipal council. As for the issue of calculating rent based on physical objects or gold, the Executive Yuan has already issued a ban. If rent is calculated in foreign currency, the new financial reform plan prohibits the circulation of foreign currency, which is also a violation of the law. However, in fact, this phenomenon is widespread. However, from a judicial point of view, the lease contract is agreed upon by both parties, and if there is no dispute, it is actually impossible to prohibit it. Regarding the issue of calculating rent based on the cost of living index, the base number is extremely difficult to reasonably determine, and the authorities are still studying and considering it.

(1) The prohibition of calculating rent in foreign currency has already been resolved by this meeting and has been clearly stipulated in Article 6 of the Municipal Housing Lease Management Regulations. The Municipal Government should strictly implement it and send a letter to the Shanghai Local Court for strict handling. Resolution passed. (2) The Municipal Government was previously urged by the General Assembly to revise the maximum amount of rent in this city as soon as possible, but it has not yet been drafted. Should it be urged again? Resolution: A letter should be sent to the Municipal Government to promptly draft and complete it, and submit it to the meeting for review. (3) The Municipal Government's request to amend Article 3 of the Regulations on Penalties for Late Payment of Land Value Tax to increase the fine was approved. Resolution passed. (4) Single regulations implemented in this city that relate to the rights and obligations of the people should, in accordance with the law, be reviewed and approved by this council. The Municipal Government has not paid enough attention to this. How should it be handled? Resolution: A letter should be sent to the Municipal Government for strict implementation. (5) It is heard that the Municipal Police Bureau will increase the multiple of the fine for violating police regulations according to the cost of living index. Is there a legal basis for this? Resolution: A letter should be sent to the Municipal Government for inquiry.

### Tightening of Credit to Suppress Prices; Authorities Have Control Power; Separate Measures to Handle How to Price Gold and Silver; The Issue of Silver Dollar Exchanges by Banks and Firms Still Requires Detailed Study

[Report from this newspaper] Finance Minister Xu Kan and President of the National Bank Liu Gongyun were originally scheduled to return to Shanghai yesterday afternoon, but due to weather unsuitable for flying, the return has been rescheduled for today and are expected to arrive at 4 p.m. The new financial plan will be implemented gradually starting tomorrow, after the two have consulted with the financial community. According to a person in charge of the National Bank: (1) The authorities have considerable control over tightening credit and suppressing prices. Whether it is materials or gold and silver, they can decide to sell large quantities at any time based on market conditions to suppress rising prices, so there is a sense of vigilance in the market, and speculators are somewhat intimidated. (2) The issues of how to control the buying and selling of gold and silver, and how to make the exchange rate between gold and silver dollars and Gold Yuan coupons reasonable, may be handled by other means. (3) The issues of how to handle foreign currencies and how to open up the method of importing foreign exchange will be implemented after consultation between the Import Management Committee, the National Bank, and the Finance Department. (4) The possibility of silver dollar deposits and exchanges by banks and firms still requires detailed study due to technical difficulties. There must be proper measures for the National Bank's silver dollars circulating among the people. (5) Whether the Gold Yuan coupons will continue to be issued in the future needs to be requested for instructions. Even if they continue to be issued, a principle of contraction will be adopted.

Around 9:20, the price reached a minimum of 133,000 yuan to 135,000 yuan. Before 11:30 a.m., insiders were afraid that the National Bank would sell large quantities, so they hesitated to trade, and the gold shops were particularly deserted. However, by noon, there was still no news of the National Bank selling, and credit turned looser, and the exchange rate for settlement continued to rise, so the market rose sharply, closing at 140,500 yuan to 142,500 yuan at 12:30 p.m. There was no trading in the afternoon due to the weekend.

### Cotton Yarn Continues to Rise Sharply

Cotton yarn is trending firm. Because traditional tariffs will be slightly collected on books and documents, people's expectations are high, and holders are unwilling to sell, resulting in high asking prices. However, buyers are mostly taking a wait-and-see approach, so transactions are not seen as robust. As a result, the prices of various yarns continue to rise. 42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 770,000 yuan, once reaching a high of 825,000 yuan, before falling back to close at 800,000 yuan, up 60,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose 70,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon initially stood at 580,000 yuan, reaching a maximum of 610,000 yuan, and finally fell back to 590,000 yuan, ultimately rising 20,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse spot goods were bid up all the way from 475,000 yuan to close at 530,000 yuan. Factory orders rose 50,000 yuan, closing at 490,000 yuan. Trading on Monday opened at 520,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse initially opened at 440,000 yuan, closing at a high of 475,000 yuan at noon, a rise of 45,000 yuan. Other grades also generally rose by about 10%.

### Tung Oil Weakens

Tung oil, after several days of frenzied and rapid increases, suddenly turned soft on the market yesterday, with prices falling across the board by more than 5,000 yuan. The reason is that the positions of fellow traders showed a slight tightening, and the foreign exchange transfer certificate also fell sharply, causing people to suddenly lose momentum, and the process was difficult to sustain.

### Owners Take Advantage of High Prices to Sell: Rice Market Momentum Turns Back: Flour Rises, Coarse Grains Increase, Oil Market Stable

The rice market is precarious at high prices, and prices are falling from their peaks. Because they had risen too much the previous day, owners took advantage of the high prices to sell, and the selling pressure was very strong. The market initially opened down 500-600 yuan, and at closing it was even weaker, finally falling 700-800 yuan. High-quality white japonica rice fell 800 yuan, opening at 13,800 yuan, medium-grade goods fell 1,000 yuan, and early rice fell 800 yuan. In the North Market, white japonica rice fell 600 yuan, closing at 14,000 yuan, and early indica rice fell 600-700 yuan. The total arrivals in the two markets were 8,104 piculs.

Edible Oil: Initially opened steadily, and after a slight fluctuation, it rose because taxpayers actively participated. Soybean oil opened at 55,000 yuan, and slowly rose in the afternoon, reaching a maximum of 58,000 yuan. The closing price fell slightly to 57,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil closed at 54,000 yuan, each rising 3,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Jiangbei Jiton raw oil was 62,000 yuan, and old-barrel cooked rapeseed oil rose from 46,000 yuan to 48,000 yuan. Other oils generally rose by 3,000 yuan. Soybean cake was purchased by the Qingdao gang, rising 600-700 yuan. Changzi cake once reached 6,800 yuan, closing at 6,400 yuan.

Flour: Slightly increased. Initially, it once fell due to the decline of various items, but because credit was stable, the northern gang made considerable purchases. Although rice prices fell, people's confidence remained firm, and the market momentum finally rebounded. The warship initially fell 200 yuan, and at the close rebounded to 5,670 yuan. After the close, retail investors remained active, and owners raised prices, pushing the market higher again, finally trading at 5,750 yuan. Lao Che rose slightly by 100 yuan, and there was very little trading in the afternoon. Bran followed the rise, with large bags of Fuxin rising slightly by 250 yuan, closing at 4,600 yuan.

Coarse Grains: Market momentum fluctuated upwards. At the beginning of the market, due to the decline in rice prices, the sales of soybeans were quite sluggish, and they fell slightly. Later, upon hearing of the rise in oil cake, they rebounded. The initial opening of Zha beans fell below the 10,000 yuan mark, but at the close rebounded to its original level. Holders of raw peanuts were unwilling to sell, and held on firmly, and there was no trading. The Qing gang actively purchased corn, and it rose again by more than 10%. Red sorghum sales were extremely sluggish, falling by about 10%.
