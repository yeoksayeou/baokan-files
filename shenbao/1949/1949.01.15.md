### Mao Zedong Officially Issues Statement Proposing Eight Conditions for Peace Talks; Government Side Is Studying Them in Detail

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 14th (Broadcasting): The Chinese Communist Party Radio Station officially released today the "Statement on the Current Situation" signed by Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, on January 12, proposing for the first time eight conditions for peace negotiations. The full text of this statement is more than 1,500 words long, and the eight conditions are: (1) Punish war criminals; (2) Abolish the existing constitution; (3) Abolish the existing legal system; (4) Reorganize all government troops based on democratic principles; (5) Confiscate bureaucratic capital; (6) Reform the land system; (7) Abolish "traitorous" treaties; (8) Convene a political consultative conference without the participation of "reactionaries" to establish a democratic coalition government to take over all powers of the Kuomintang government and local governments.

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 14th (Broadcasting): According to a broadcast by the Chinese Communist Party Radio Station on the 14th, CCP leader Mao Zedong issued a statement on the current situation today in the name of Chairman of the Central Committee of the CCP, first attacking the government and the United States, saying that they should bear full responsibility for the civil war. The statement began by saying: "Since July 1946, the reactionary Kuomintang government in Nanjing, with the extravagant help of American imperialism, has violated the will of the people, torn up the truce agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and launched a nationwide civil war, which has been going on for two and a half years. During these two and a half years of war, the Nanjing Kuomintang government, against the will of the people, convened a pseudo-National Assembly, promulgated a pseudo-constitution, elected a pseudo-president, and promulgated so-called decrees for the suppression of disturbances. It also sold out national interests to the United States, colluding with the US navy and air force to occupy China's territorial waters and airspace, and signed a large number of traitorous treaties. It also colluded with the US military advisory group to participate in the civil war, obtaining aircraft, cannons, rifles, shells, and all military supplies from the United States to slaughter and oppress the people. Based on a traitorous domestic and foreign policy, the Nanjing government commanded its millions of troops to launch a large-scale offensive against the People's Liberation Army. The people of Northeast, North, and Central China were all subjected to the ravages of the National Army. The people of Yan'an, Zhangjiakou, Changchun, Siping... and other places were all plundered and massacred by the National Army. They oppressed the broad masses of people from all walks of life in various places, demanding money and food to be used for the so-called suppression of disturbances. The Kuomintang government also constantly suppressed the just movements of various democratic parties and young students against the civil war and against hunger, and at the same time, it issued legal tender indiscriminately, leading the broad masses of the people to the brink of bankruptcy. All wealth was concentrated in the hands of bureaucratic capital, plunging the people into dire straits. The Kuomintang government cannot escape full responsibility for launching the civil war. On the contrary, since the Japanese surrender, the Chinese Communist Party has made every effort to avoid civil war. In October 1945, it conducted peace talks with the Kuomintang, and in January 1946, it signed a truce agreement. At the Political Consultative Conference, it signed a joint agreement with the Kuomintang. The CCP has also constantly worked for these agreements. Unfortunately, these agreements were all disregarded by the Kuomintang government, which launched a domestic war. Under such circumstances, the CCP had no choice but to rise up for the interests of the country and the interests of the people, and led the People's Liberation Army to resist the offensive of 4.3 million Kuomintang troops, turning itself from weak to strong, recovering all lost territories, and occupying major cities such as Zhengzhou and Xuzhou... The People's Liberation Army overcame unparalleled difficulties and strengthened itself. Now the People's Liberation Army is stronger than the reactionary Kuomintang army in terms of numbers, morale, and equipment. The People's Liberation Army has sufficient reason and full confidence that it can completely eliminate the remaining forces of the Kuomintang in a short period of time. As long as the People's Liberation Army launches a few more major offensives, it can cause the remaining forces of the Kuomintang to collapse and be eliminated. Now the Kuomintang has reached the point where it cannot sustain itself, but in order to gain a respite so that it can regroup, President Chiang Kai-shek proposed on January 1 that he could conduct peace negotiations with the Communist Party. The CCP believes that this proposal is hypocritical because the proposal still insists on maintaining the pseudo-constitution, the pseudo-legal system, and protecting the reactionary army. The CCP believes that these are not conditions for peace talks, but conditions for continuing the war. For more than ten days, although the people have longed for peace, they do not approve of the hypocritical peace proposed by the Kuomintang. Under these circumstances, the Central Committee of the CCP issued a statement: Although the CCP can eliminate the remaining forces of the Kuomintang in a short period of time, in order to quickly end the war and reduce the suffering of the people, the CCP is willing to conduct peace negotiations with the reactionary government in Nanjing and other local governments and military groups under eight major conditions (see separate item). The CCP believes that these conditions reflect the public opinion of the people of the whole country. If the people in the Nanjing government sincerely want peace and not a deception, and do not make hypocritical calls, they should abandon their hypocritical conditions and implement the eight conditions proposed by the CCP. It is hoped that the democratic parties of the whole country will rise up to strive for democratic peace. In addition, please all combatants of the People's Liberation Army pay attention: Before the conditions for democratic peace are realized by the Nanjing government, you must never slacken your combat efforts! Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the CCP, January 12, 1949."

[Our Dispatch] Nanjing, 14th: The CCP radio's broadcast of Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation has been transmitted to the capital. However, as of the night of the 14th, political figures had not yet been able to see the full text of the statement, so they did not make any positive comments. However, judging from the main points of the statement, since the Communist side said that it could still negotiate with the government side, it seems that the door to peace has not been closed. However, there is also another feeling, which is that regarding the first condition of the eight conditions proposed by the Communist side, which is to punish war criminals, and the eighth condition, which is to convene a political consultative conference and reject the so-called reactionary elements from participating, it is obviously doubtful whether it has the sincerity of peace talks. The government and all relevant parties are currently studying the content of the CCP broadcast in detail.

### Reception for All Circles in Wuhan; Bai Chongxi Briefly Describes the Current Situation; Encourages Military and Civilians in Central China to Prepare for War and Seek Peace

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 14th] Bai Chongxi, Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in Central China, invited the heads of various agencies and groups in Wuhan, supervisory committee members residing in Hubei, and gentry to a tea party in the auditorium of the Political Committee on the 14th. More than 150 people attended. First, Bai made a brief report on the current situation, and then Kong Geng, Yu Zheng, Xu Kuizhi, Xia Guangyu, Ai Yuying, and others expressed their opinions. The meeting adjourned at around 5 o'clock. Bai's remarks at the tea party were as follows:

"Gentlemen, leaders of the party, government, and military circles, in recent months, Chongxi has been suffering from bronchitis and has not fully recovered, so I have not been able to meet and talk with you. Recently, the current situation is brewing peace, and the issue that everyone is most concerned about is the current situation, especially during this major turning point in the overall situation, rumors are rife, causing widespread bewilderment and anxiety, which is enough to shake morale and will. Some people think that peace is about to be realized, and they can release their horses and let the cattle graze, being overly optimistic and showing slackness in their will. Conversely, some people are pessimistic and seem to be in dire straits, falling into despair. Both of these mentalities are not accurate. Therefore, I have specially invited you to this tea party today, taking this opportunity to make a brief report on the current situation.

Since the victory of the War of Resistance, the Central Government has adhered to the goal of peaceful construction in order to realize democratic constitutionalism and build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, there was political consultation, and all parties and factions jointly formulated a program for peaceful construction, hoping to resolve the disputes between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party through political means and jointly build a prosperous and happy Republic of China. Unexpectedly, mutual trust was not established, and the political consultation lasted for a year without any results. The government was forced to take military measures, which have been going on for three years, but national unity and peace have not yet been achieved, and the suffering of the people has been increasing. Recently, local public opinion organs, in order to seek national stability and construction, and for the military and civilians to recuperate, have spontaneously called for peace and advocated a ceasefire between the two sides, pending resolution by a peace conference. In his New Year's Day message, the President also proclaimed the advocacy of peace, preserving the nation's vitality and relieving the people's suffering. Now that the people long for peace, and the government is willing to realize peace, public opinion and the government, both at the top and at the bottom, have reached a consensus, and the door to peace has been reopened. Whether peace can be realized depends on the main key, which is that both sides respect public opinion and conduct open and honest consultations. However, the CCP has not yet officially and clearly expressed its position, and it is still launching fierce offensives against the National Army in Pingjin and Huaibei. Xiangfan in northern Hubei is now being attacked again. In such a situation, peace, which is hoped for by the people of the whole country, still relies on all parties to make the greatest efforts. We must recognize the seriousness of the current situation and deeply understand that peace cannot be achieved by chance. We should recognize that we can only have peace if we can fight, and we can only have peace if we are prepared to fight. We should prepare for war to seek peace, and not forget war while seeking peace. We should still stick to our posts, fulfill our duties, and be highly vigilant without any slackness. No matter how the current situation evolves, I hope that the military and civilians of Central China will be united in their hearts and work hard together to save us from the unprecedented crisis in the 5,000-year history and strive for the realization of true peace."

### Zhang Qun Reports on His Trip to Hubei and Hunan

[Our Dispatch] Nanjing, 14th: Kuomintang legislators and supervisors, as well as national representatives, held a current affairs symposium at the Central Party Headquarters on the morning of the 14th. Chairman Sun Ke attended, along with Yu Youren, Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, Ju Zheng, Wu Zhongxin, Zhang Lisheng, Hong Lanyou, and dozens of others. First, Zheng Yanfen, Secretary-General of the Central Standing Committee, reported, saying that there were many rumors from the outside world recently, especially misunderstandings about Hunan and Hubei. He specially invited Zhang Yuejun, who had just returned to Nanjing from Wuhan, to attend the meeting to report, so as to help everyone understand. Then, Zhang gave a detailed report on his trip to Hunan and Hubei. Zhang first read Bai Chongxi's telegrams to the President at the end of last year and the beginning of this month. According to the content of the two telegrams, each of which was several hundred words long, the first was to explain the current war situation, and the second was to ask the central government to make a clear decision on peace or war so that it could await orders and obey. There was no suggestion from Bai as rumored by the outside world. In his report, Zhang specially pointed out the inaccuracies in the Associated Press report, especially the so-called "ultimatum" was inappropriate. Zhang also reported that the opinion of Chairman Cheng Qian obtained during his trip to Hunan Province was: "The central government and local governments should have consistent opinions and unite sincerely." After Zhang finished his report, the attendees spoke separately, including Zhang Daofan, Duan Jianmin, and more than a dozen others. They had some inquiries, but there were no concrete opinions. Then, some people raised the importance of consistent unity, and after many people expressed their support, the meeting ended successfully. Shao Lizi also attended the meeting on the 14th, but did not express his opinion.

### Legislators and Supervisors Concerned About Peace Exchange Views at Separate Meetings in Nanjing

[Our Dispatch] Nanjing, 14th: Legislators in Nanjing held another discussion meeting at 3 p.m. on the 14th to exchange views on the peace issue. More than 100 legislators attended, and Zhang Jingyu was elected as the chairman. First, Huang Shaogu gave a comprehensive report on the reactions from all parties since the President's New Year's Day message and the development of the situation. Then, a wide-ranging discussion began, and the legislators spoke enthusiastically. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m. Although there were still no concrete resolutions on the 14th, it was very different from the previous discussion meeting, in that no one openly opposed peace anymore. Only some legislators explained that the President's New Year's Day message was to clarify public opinion's misunderstandings about peace and eliminate the atmosphere of defeatism, and did not mean abandoning the policy of suppressing the rebellion. Another group of legislators, a larger number, pointed out that the President's New Year's Day message clearly stated that if the CCP was sincere, the government was willing to negotiate peace with it. If it was said that it had no sincerity to negotiate peace before the CCP made a formal response, and then to make an ambiguous interpretation of the President's message, it would be tantamount to saying that the President also had no sincerity. Therefore, the government's peace policy was not in doubt. Moreover, in fact, peace was what the people of the whole country longed for and needed. The Legislative Yuan and the government were inseparable. Today, what should be done was to conform to the situation, represent the people, and assist the government in seeking the ultimate realization of peace. Some legislators also put forward concrete opinions on promoting peace talks. Some advocated that the government should issue a ceasefire order, some advocated that the government should send officials to the CCP area to negotiate peace, some advocated re-electing national representatives, amending the constitution, and implementing the constitution for the second time, and some advocated using international assistance to achieve fair peace. However, as it was a discussion meeting, all opinions were regarded as personal opinions and were not considered by the assembly to make a resolution.

[Our Dispatch] Zhenjiang, 14th: Su Sheng's legislator Niu Jianchu, based on Article 69 of the Constitution, sent a letter to the Legislative Yuan requesting it to send a letter to solicit the consent of one-fourth of the legislators to convene a temporary meeting of the Legislative Yuan in the near future to jointly discuss the major plan for peace.

[Our Dispatch] Nanjing, 14th: In order to promote peace talks, the supervisors sent representatives to visit Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Qun, and Shao Lizi on the 13th. They also invited Zhang, Shao, and the other three to lunch at the International Friendship Club at noon on the 14th, and asked the three to report on the peace issue and exchange views. The three all reported one after another. Then, Supervisors Tang Honglie, Sun Yulin, and others also spoke and exchanged many views. The meeting adjourned at around 3 p.m. It was heard that during the meeting on the 14th, the path to seek peace and the key to not achieving peace were discussed in detail, and there were many gains. After the three left the meeting, the supervisors decided to convene a temporary secret meeting on the morning of the 15th to further discuss the results of the meeting on the 14th in order to decide on concrete and feasible measures.

However, in North China, the troops under his command were being beaten, so he had to fight back in some places. At present, people in Peiping and Tianjin are calling for peace. As long as the other side does not fight, he will not fight hard, and he said that he neither seeks war nor submits.

[United Press, Peiping, 14th] Here, it is planned to send civic leaders to ask the Communist army to cease fire in the Peiping area, which has gradually taken shape today.

The activities of Zhang Dongsheng, a professor at Yenching University, are also attracting attention.

### Increasingly Urgent Situation in Tianjin - Communist Army Shells City, Many Shells Landing - Fierce Fighting from Noon Yesterday Until Late at Night

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Beiping, 8:15 PM on the 14th] According to a late-night newspaper here reporting Tianjin news: The battle situation in Tianjin is extremely tense. Shells are landing everywhere in the city, and the people are panic-stricken. There are few pedestrians on the streets, and businesses are all closed. At 12 noon today, the Communist army launched a dense artillery assault on the Nationalist army's positions along the eastern and western lines. There was extremely fierce hand-to-hand combat in the Dongjuzi and Xiyingmen areas. The Beiping-Tianjin United Exchange telephone line malfunctioned and was out of service this afternoon.

Editorial

### Starting with the Holy Land Problem

The most intractable problem after the war, the Palestine problem, has been handled by the United Nations for almost two full years. This problem is like a tangled mess; the more you try to unravel it, the more tangled it becomes. Not only has no "dead knot" been untied, but the "dead knots" have become tighter and tighter. No wonder the great scientist Einstein would blame the United Nations for its incompetence. At the end of November last year, there was a strong hope for a truce between the Jews and Arabs, and the restoration of peace in the Holy Land. But in the blink of an eye, an unexpected twist occurred. Differences of opinion arose within the Arab League. Jordan demanded the annexation of the eastern part of the Holy Land, while Egypt, Syria, and other countries jointly opposed it. As a result, the flames of war in the Negev rekindled. The British Cabinet then decided to prepare for military action. Two thousand British troops landed in Aqaba in case of emergency, and there were also rumors that the Mediterranean fleet would be dispatched to blockade the Israeli coast. As a result, the situation in the Middle East became tense again!

The resurgence of the Holy Land problem not only caused a great uproar in the British Cabinet, with Foreign Secretary Bevin being criticized and threatening to resign several times, but also almost caused friction between Britain and the United States internationally. According to analysts from the United Nations at Lake Success, it is believed that the divergence of opinion between Britain and the United States on the Holy Land problem may develop into a competition between the two countries for political position in the Middle East. Britain hopes that Jordan can obtain greater benefits, so it strives to find a peaceful solution to the Holy Land problem that is favorable to Jordan, while the United States supports an immediate truce, which would allow Egypt to gain more. Therefore, under this international backdrop, the Holy Land problem has become even more complex, and the situation in the Middle East has become even more serious.

Palestine was transferred by the old League of Nations to British trusteeship after the First World War, but the problem itself was never resolved. After the Second World War, Britain submitted it to the United Nations General Assembly in April 1947 and requested the next General Assembly to make recommendations on the future government of Palestine. The first General Assembly established a Special Committee on Palestine, composed of representatives from eleven countries, to conduct preliminary research on the Holy Land problem and submit reports to the regular session at any time. In November of the same year, the Second General Assembly of the United Nations passed the recommendation of the Special Committee on Palestine by a two-thirds majority, advocating the division of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states, economically interconnected, and internationalizing the Holy City of Jerusalem, under the direct jurisdiction of the United Nations.

This plan to implement partition in the Holy Land is theoretically unobjectionable, but it is problematic in practice. The Arab countries were the first to reject this recommendation, and Britain was unwilling to assume responsibility for implementing a plan that had not been agreed upon by both sides. So the problem remained unresolved. The Special Committee on Palestine reported to the Security Council in February 1948, requesting the United Nations to take swift action to assist in the implementation of this proposal in order to prevent bloodshed in the Holy Land. The Security Council then requested the General Assembly to hold a special session to discuss the situation in the Holy Land, resulting in the appointment of a mediator, Count Bernadotte of Sweden, to personally mediate the dispute between the Jews and Arabs in the Holy Land. However, the British Mandate over Palestine ended on May 15, and the Jews opportunistically declared the establishment of the State of Israel, and the Arab Allied Forces then rushed into the Holy Land, thus the flames of war in the Holy Land broke out. Since then, although the Security Council has repeatedly called for a truce, and the mediator has run around and appealed, even sacrificing his life, the situation has been one of talking and fighting, and fighting and talking. It was not until the end of November last year that a ray of hope for peace was revealed, but unfortunately, it was ruined by an unexpected twist. This is really unfortunate for the Holy Land, and it is also unfortunate for the whole world!

The protracted nature of the Palestine problem is due to the inherent incompatibility between Jews and Arabs, but looking at the course of its development, it is not difficult to see that Britain and the United States cannot shirk their responsibility for the Holy Land problem being trapped in a stalemate. Although Britain has announced that the mandate over the Holy Land has ended, it still cannot forget the Middle East and is reluctant to give up its vested political position in the Middle East. The United States has also never had a "firm and unwavering" stance on the Holy Land problem. One moment it sympathizes with the Jewish "restoration movement," and the next moment it is afraid of offending the Arab countries and losing their goodwill. Therefore, it goes back and forth, wandering on a fork in the road. Under the contradiction of these two forces, the Holy Land problem can only be trapped in a stalemate and cannot be opened.

This problem seems to have taken a turn for the better in recent days. We hope that British and American diplomats can broaden their vision and should focus on peace in the Middle East, quickly abandon the self-serving power politics, and immediately take diplomatic action to jointly seek a century-long plan for peace in the Middle East.

### Literary Writer's Case of Betraying the Country Sentenced - Luo Binji Sentenced to Two and a Half Years of Imprisonment - Accomplice Meng Shirong Sentenced to One Year and Ten Months

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The case of literary writer Luo Binji betraying the country has been concluded by the Special Criminal Court of the Capital, and the sentence was pronounced yesterday, sentencing him to two years and six months of imprisonment. Luo has been detained in Changchun since his arrest on March 11, 1943, for a total of one year and ten months and three days. After the verdict, he will be able to be released after serving another eight months of imprisonment. Luo is currently detained in the Tiger Bridge Prison in this city. Another accomplice, Meng Shirong, was sentenced to one year and ten months of imprisonment, which has already been served and he has been released. The facts are recorded as follows:

Luo Binji, also known as Zhang Junpu, was friendly with Zhou Jingwen. Because the standing committee members of the Democratic League were persuaded by Zhou during the political consultations, Luo had agreed to be nominated as a National Representative by the Democratic League. After the victory, he was introduced to Chen Jianzhong by Zhou, and they agreed to go from Shanghai to Tianjin, then to Changchun. He carried a draft of Zhou Jingwen's "Letter to Armed Comrades in the Northeast and Letter to Compatriots in the Northeast" and agreed to represent the so-called Preparatory Committee of the Northeast People's Autonomous Committee. On March 8, 1947, he signed an agreement with Chen Cang (Chen Jianzhong), representative of the so-called Northeast Youth Association, and Li Kaizhou (Kong Zhiming), representative of the Northeast People's Patriotic Aid Association, advocating the establishment of a local joint government for the autonomous region of the Northeast, planning to seize territory and organize local political power in areas of the Northeast not yet recovered by the National Army, naming it the "Temporary Northeast People's Autonomous Committee," with the Central Executive Committee as the highest authority, and establishing the Northeast People's Self-Defense Army Headquarters. Meng Shirong served as a shock team member in the Northeast in 1942, was injured and unemployed, and met Chen Jianzhong several times. He mistakenly recognized him as a member of the Ministry of National Defense and, understanding his conspiracy plan, also did not withdraw, but followed along and echoed. On March 11, 1947, he set off from Changchun by car, first to Nongan, then to Harbin, when he was discovered by the Northeast Security Command and captured en route. The prosecutor investigated and prosecuted him. The presiding judge believed that the defendants illegally called for local autonomy, violating the National Constitution, and committing the crime of internal rebellion. Therefore, he ruled in accordance with the law.

### US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Approves Acheson as Secretary of State, Acheson Determined to Maintain Consistency in US Diplomacy, First Measure Will Be to Purge Pro-Communist Elements Within the State Department

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Washington, 14th Broadcast: The Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously approved Acheson's nomination as Secretary of State.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th Dispatch] Acheson, who has been nominated as the US Secretary of State, stated in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today that his foreign policy would not deviate significantly from President Truman's policies, and that he is not an appeaser of the Soviet Union. Acheson's appointment as Secretary of State requires approval from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Foreign Relations Committee did not publicly question his foreign policy stance today, partly because it is related to US interests and security, and also because the US foreign policy will be determined by the President himself. The Foreign Relations Committee today asked Acheson, based on his past experience, to conduct a comprehensive review of US policy towards the Soviet Union. Acheson clearly stated that US foreign policy should be decided by the President, and the President has made it clear that he has no intention of changing foreign policy. Regarding his experience in the State Department, Acheson said, "From my past experience, I have learned that US foreign policy needs to be stable and consistent." He said that some people believe he favors the Soviet Union, but this is contrary to the principles he has adhered to throughout his political life. He is determined to do everything possible to prevent those who seek to subvert the government from infiltrating the State Department. Former Secretary of State Stettinius strongly advocated that the Senate should approve Acheson's nomination, and praised Acheson as an intelligent and wise man who will surely make the honor and security of the nation the goal of his work. Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expects that the Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate will approve Acheson's nomination.

[United Press, Washington, 13th Dispatch] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee questioned Acheson today about his views after taking office as Secretary of State. Acheson assured that he would continue to implement the "non-appeasement" policy towards the Soviet Union after taking office as Secretary of State, and said that he would see to the purging of pro-communist elements within the State Department. Senator Vandenberg asked Acheson to clearly state his "basic attitude" towards the Soviet Union. Acheson replied, "The decision on foreign policy rests with the President. The President has declared in the clearest terms that he does not intend to make any changes." Acheson's remarks reinforce the general impression that Truman himself will be the primary figure in the future decisions of US foreign policy, and that Acheson, as Secretary of State, will serve as an advisor and executor, not a policy planner.

US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith is currently resting in the United States. The President pointed out that Smith does not wish to return to Moscow due to health reasons, but stated that he would still be willing to return if needed. Truman also said that because Smith's health condition is uncertain, he did not want to comment on Smith's plans at this time.

### Additional Balancing Fee for Deposits and Exchanges - Minister of Finance Explains to Assembly - Aims to Avoid Profiteering from Arbitrage - Genuine Compelling Reasons

The Municipal Assembly previously resolved at its eighth meeting of the first session to suggest that the Ministry of Finance improve the method of depositing and exchanging gold and silver and stabilize prices. Yesterday, a reply telegram was received from Minister Xu of the Ministry of Finance, explaining the gold and silver deposit and exchange policy in detail. The original telegram stated: "To Speaker Pan Gongzhan and Deputy Speaker Xu Jijing of the Shanghai Municipal Assembly, greetings. I have received and noted your telegram. I am grateful for your Assembly's concern about the deposit and exchange of gold and silver and the stabilization of prices. As for your instructions to the Central Bank to sell a large amount of materials to suppress prices, we have already complied. As for the gold deposit and exchange method, it is intended to consolidate the currency and contract the currency in circulation. At the beginning of the program, there was no limit to the amount of deposit and exchange. Later, due to large-scale arbitrage and manipulation by major players, the gold that was exchanged fell into the hands of a few, and ordinary people lost the opportunity for equal savings. The government accepted the suggestion and set a limit of one tael per person for deposit and exchange. Not long after the implementation, because the deposit and exchange price and the market price were vastly different, depositors could obtain huge profits in a single transaction and rushed to purchase, making it impossible to maintain order. In order to reduce deposit and exchange congestion, implement the original purpose of contracting the currency in circulation, and prevent depositors from obtaining excessive profits, a decision was made to add a balancing fee. The internal value of the Gold Yuan is dependent on the deposit and exchange of the Gold Yuan, while the external value is dependent on the price of foreign exchange trading. In order to encourage exports and attract overseas remittances, the government has adopted a linked system for import and export trade, using foreign exchange transfer certificates to make foreign exchange prices suitable for natural levels. At the same time, in order to absorb overseas remittances, the price of overseas remittances should not be too low. Therefore, a huge difference arose between the foreign exchange price and the amount of Gold Yuan paid for the deposit and exchange of gold and silver, causing the internal and external values of the Gold Yuan to lose their equilibrium. Therefore, we had to adjust it. All these measures are in fact a need to weigh the pros and cons and adapt to the facts, and there are compelling reasons. Your Assembly represents public opinion, and you lead public discourse. I hope you will explain it well so that everyone can understand and empathize. I am very grateful. Xu Kan."

### Balance Fee for Depositing and Exchanging Gold - Reduced by Another 500 Yuan Yesterday

Yesterday, a total of 1,564 application forms were issued by various deposit and exchange banks and treasuries, including 364 from national banks, 300 from the Bank of China, 150 from the Bank of Communications, 200 from the Central Agricultural Bank, 100 from the Central Trust Bureau, 150 from the Postal Remittances Bureau, and 300 from the Central Cooperative Treasury. In addition, temporary receipts issued on the 7th of this month are scheduled to be exchanged for gold and silver today. Regarding the widespread rumors of a suspension of exchange, responsible parties revealed that the current deposit and exchange policy has indeed lost its meaning, and the competent authorities are discussing whether to continue this policy, and a decision will be made within days.

The soldiers returned to the team and gathered dozens of soldiers, carrying grenades to the dormitory of the special service company soldiers to seek revenge. One of them pulled the trigger of the grenade and intended to throw it at the entrance of the first- and second-class ticket offices. At that time, Beizhan was the time when various trains were concentrated for departure, and there were thousands of passengers lining up to wait for tickets in the hall. Just as the soldier was about to throw the grenade, his major officer rushed to the scene after hearing the news and bravely stepped forward to snatch the grenade. The grenade was already smoking and about to explode. At this critical moment, the major gently placed the grenade in a place with fewer passengers. There was a loud explosion, and several workers and passengers fled in panic, causing great chaos. After the incident, Chief Huang of the Unified Inspection Office immediately reported by telegram to Director He Longqing of the Inspection Office, who personally went to the station to suppress the situation. By then, the soldiers who caused the incident had already fled. Director He ordered Zhong Wei, the leader of the army, to be responsible for punishing the perpetrators. At the time of the grenade explosion, Ge Demin, an employee of the Ordnance Maintenance Experimental Factory of the Ordnance Department, and two porters were slightly injured. Train No. 41, which was originally scheduled to leave for Hangzhou at 1:10 p.m., was delayed until 4:15 p.m. The officers and soldiers of the 63rd Army took that train to Hangzhou.

### Surge in Lines to Buy Rationed Rice - Many Rice Shops Hanging Sold-Out Signs - Generally Believed That Before the New Rationed Price is Announced, All Rationed Grain Should Be Urgently Allocated and Closely Supervised

[Our Newspaper] The original regulations for the population-rationed rice for January in this city stipulated that each certificate would be allocated 15 市斤 catties at a price of 63 yuan, and the priority-rationed price was 42 yuan. However, on the 12th, the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration 美經合分署美援運用會 announced that the price of population-rationed grain would be adjusted every two weeks or ten days according to a new method, and Mayor Wu explained on the 13th that it might be implemented at any time starting this month. After hearing the news, citizens in various districts rushed to the rice shops to buy rice, but were rejected by most rice shops on the grounds that "rationed rice is sold out." This reporter visited various districts in the afternoon yesterday and found that there were at least twenty or thirty people lining up in front of each rationed rice shop, but about seven out of ten had already hung out "sold out" signs, and the crowd was still waiting. According to the Civil Food Allocation Office, more than three-fifths of the rationed rice for each rationed rice shop in this city for January has been allocated, and all of the rice that should have been rationed last year has also been allocated. Currently, 25,000 to 30,000 piculs continue to be allocated every day. With 2,000 rationed rice shops in this city, each shop should be able to supply at least 10 piculs of rationed rice per day. In theory, the shops should not be sold out so quickly, and the office has supervisory commissioners stationed in each district, so it is believed that there should not be any malfeasance. However, it is heard that the office will allow each rationed shop to report the portion of the rationed rice that has been allocated at the old price in the future. Therefore, the current claim of "rationed rice sold out" by some rice shops is obviously a disguise to hide the rice and wait for the announcement of the new price in order to seek profits. At the same time, rumors have been circulating in the market for the past two days that the new price of rationed rice will be adjusted within days, and it is said that it will increase several times, which has further increased the psychological anxiety of citizens. According to the opinions of the majority of citizens, they believe that the authorities responsible for allocating civil food were ill-advised to announce the news that the price would be adjusted at any time before all the rationed rice was allocated and before the rationing work for this month was completed. The result will only add to the endless turmoil. Is it true that the "rationed rice is sold out" claimed by the rice shops is true? Are the supervisory commissioners in each district fulfilling their supervisory responsibilities? Can the allocation of rationed rice for this month be completed as soon as possible? How can the rationing be improved or restored before the new price is announced? The general public hopes that the authorities will thoroughly investigate and announce the results to dispel public doubts.

Pricing Calculation for Rationed Grain - Sino-American Discussion of Methods

[Central News Agency] The decision to adjust the price of urban rationed grain at any time has obviously attracted widespread attention, but reporters have learned from various sources that the exact standards to which the sales price will be adjusted has yet to be agreed upon. After repeated discussions by relevant parties last month, it was proposed to stipulate that the average market price for the last five days of each month would be the basis for adjustment, but since then, market price fluctuations have increased, and this method is no longer feasible. The U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration 美經合分署美援運用委會, the Grain Purchase Association, and the Municipal Government will hold a meeting soon to discuss and reach a final decision on the calculation method.

Therefore, the major gold shops in the city are still in a state of semi-suspension. However, a small number of gold shops have resumed the sale of savings gold in order to maintain their livelihoods, and the Gold Shops Association finds it difficult to restrict them. As for various rumors, such as gold shops listing prices for ornaments, they are all false rumors, because the price of gold ornaments can only be calculated and listed after the official resumption of business.

### The Grain Market Tends to Be Quiet; Rice Prices Are Weak; White Rice in the Southern Market Drops by 40 Yuan

The rice market turned weak yesterday, and transactions became quiet. Although the arrival of goods was small yesterday, the sales were even slower, because the underground interest rates were still high, and the rice shops had limited appetite and did not accept much. The prices in the Southern Market were similar to the previous day when it opened in the morning, but the Central Market gradually showed weakness. The closing price was slightly lower than the previous day by 30 to 40 yuan. White rice was 1,360 yuan, a decrease of 40 yuan. Thin rice was reduced to 1,400 yuan, and early rice was 1,360 yuan, each down 20 yuan. White yuan and Yin yuan were stable.

Wheat Flour: Initially fell and then rose, resulting in a slight increase compared to the previous day. The opening trend was very weak because the underground interest rates were still high, and the owners were very willing to sell. The old trucks opened below 500 yuan, at 495 yuan.

Corn rose slightly after being flat due to purchases by the Qingdao gang taking advantage of the low prices, eventually rising by 50 yuan. Red sorghum was slightly weak by 20 yuan. Sesame sales were sluggish, falling by 50 yuan. Raw peanuts rose by 200 yuan due to absorption by the Guangzhou gang.

### The Tea Market Is Apparently Flat but Covertly Firm.

[Our Newspaper] According to tea industry insiders, the varieties of red and green tea are rare due to both production and inventory shortages. High-quality teas are even harder to find, so although there is a supply currently, the body is not as exquisite as in the past. However, tea households also regard them as treasures and are reluctant to part with them, so the trend is unmatched. Prices have not shown significant progress due to the disparity in the quality of the goods compared to the past, but they are apparently flat but covertly firm, and the bottom is quite solid. Transactions are still narrow as buyers hesitate.

### Sugar Prices Retreat

The sugar market was inactive yesterday, and the trend was weak. Most commodities fell more than rose, and people's confidence could not be boosted, so prices turned down in the afternoon.

The stock of Xingbai packaged Zhenji ice flakes was scarce, and the buying appetite was weak, so the asking price rose by 100 yuan, but the rest were sluggish.

### Money Market Gradually Stabilizes, Cash Is Still Tight

Market dismantling interest rates vary depending on the needs, with the highest still reaching 70 yuan for daily dismantling, but generally 60 yuan, and as low as 50 yuan for supply. Cash funds are still very tight, and premiums are still high.

The money market showed slight easing near noon, and the supply of orders was also strong, but market dismantling rates still held steady. Financial experts agree that this is a hidden danger for the future of commodity prices.

### Overseas Remittances Still Listed at 200 Yuan; Foreign Exchange Certificates Stop Rising and Fall

The opening price was 200 yuan with supply but no demand, and then fell to 196 yuan, before the Bank of China absorbed a small amount. Later, because the buying interest was scarce, the market price was called lower all the way, with the lowest seen at 180 yuan. After the National Bank came out to maintain it, it stabilized slightly, selling at 181 yuan, resulting in a drop of 16 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Silk Market Trading Is Small

The silk market trend fluctuated yesterday, and trading on the market was not strong.

Heavenly Bridge No. 120 opened in the morning at 80,000 yuan. The trend in the middle was stable, and the asking price rose and fell slightly. The afternoon closed at 82,000 yuan, still flat with the previous day.

Due to the low market conditions for foreign exchange certificates, foreign companies were unwilling to absorb the export of raw silk, and the asking price was stagnant. Transactions were quite slow. Superior grade single lot spot goods were still called for 90,000 yuan in the morning. After calling, the buying appetite declined, and the market situation was bleak. People were unable to boost their spirits, and the market closed at 87,000 yuan, falling slightly by 3,000 yuan.

### The Yarn Market Is Unable to Rise

The yarn market continued to be weak yesterday, because most items outside the circle tended to decline, and the lunar New Year was approaching, and the buying appetite of customers seemed to be thin. Moreover, the underground interest rates in the market were high, and the multi-party was forced to come out due to the pressure of high interest rates, so the momentum to rise was weakened. 42-count Blue Phoenix rose from 78,000 yuan to 80,000 yuan, and the noon closing price fell back to 77,000 yuan, 2,000 yuan lower than before. 40-count Blue Phoenix fell by 3,000 yuan, and 32-count Blue Phoenix also fell slightly by 3,000 yuan.

The factory order was finally made at 45,000 yuan. One-day interest rate arbitrage was 2,500 yuan. 20-count Double Horse rose slightly by 500 yuan, and Jin Cheng and other majorities stayed at the original prices. The 16-count presented a situation where honor and disgrace were mutually visible. All 10-count tended to move downstream.

### Cotton Market Continues to Shrink

The cotton cloth market trend was still high when it first opened, but the money market on the market was still tight, and there were few buyers, so the market was unable to rise. The result was finally smaller than before. The extraburial asking price for the leading fine cloth remained around 2,000 yuan. Loose-packed trumpet boy fine cloth was made at 1,750 yuan, and the original packing stepped down from 1,850 yuan to a result of 1,825 yuan. Leading B fine cloth initially opened at 1,680 yuan, the highest reached 1,700 yuan, and near noon, the needs of all parties were relaxed, and the market fell back to 1,650 yuan, and the closing slightly returned to 1,670 yuan, a final frustration of 90 yuan.

### Shen Bao Sponsors the Second (Summer of 1948) Free Tuberculosis Prevention X-Ray Examination

In June and July of last year (1948), this newspaper jointly organized the second free tuberculosis prevention X-ray examination with the city's Lung Disease Center Clinic and 15 hospitals, including Guangci, Sino-American, Gongji, Municipal Second, Third, Fourth, Zhongshan, Hongren, Renji, Pingmin, Nanyang, Sino-Western, Chinese, and Hongqiao. A total of 2,139 readers applied for the examination before and after. Afterwards, the Lung Disease Center Clinic was entrusted with statistical work. After the experts of the clinic carefully studied, the following results were obtained:

(1) Among the 2,139 people who were examined, a total of 1,783 people (more than 83%) were completely healthy, 356 people (less than 17%) had tuberculosis, and 60 people had other conditions.

(2) According to the gender distribution, 313 men had lung disease, and 1,598 men did not have lung disease; 43 women had lung disease, and 185 women did not have lung disease.

(3) According to the occupation distribution, businessmen had the most cases of lung disease, followed by students, and farmers had the fewest cases.

(4) According to the age distribution, the 15-25 age group had the most patients, followed by the 25-30 age group, and the over 55 age group had the fewest patients.

Looking at the above figures, we can learn that men have more cases of lung disease than women, businessmen and students have more cases than farmers, and young people have more cases than old people.

At the same time, because only more than 1,000 people participated in the examination, accounting for one in 250 of the city's population, and because the occupations, ages, and genders of the examinees were mixed, the results obtained could not be accurate, but they are sufficient for medical reference.

### Strengthening Mental Defenses: A Discussion with Hu Jiafeng

[Our Newspaper Nanchang, 10th] Hu Jiafeng's governance of Jiangxi as a Jiangxi intellectual is a new cloak of "intellectual governance" on Jiangxi politics in recent decades. People who generally care about Jiangxi's political situation pay more attention to how this new policy will turn out. This reporter has been in Jiangxi for many years and deeply feels that Mr. Hu is serving his hometown with a scholar's character - public service and law-abiding. He is indeed working for his fellow villagers in the spirit of "doing practical work."

When this reporter interviewed Jiangxi Chairman Hu Jiafeng yesterday to talk about Jiangxi politics, he also discussed the suppression of the rebellion and the construction of mental defenses. Mr. Hu deeply felt that the success of today's peace talks depends on the sincerity and vision of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

He said: "President Chiang's New Year's Day message shows us that the government is seeking peace with the utmost sincerity, fully demonstrating its sincerity and vision. The solution to China's problems today requires mutual understanding and concession between the two sides. True peace cannot be achieved solely by one side's 'unrequited love'."

Defeatism Has a Serious Impact

When discussing the issue of suppressing the rebellion, Mr. Hu solemnly stated that he was concerned about the "defeatism" and "ambiguous attitude" that are currently widespread and deeply rooted in the hearts of some people. He felt that in today's war against the Communist Party, our mental defenses have been broken through, and if we do not recover in time, we will fall into an unmanageable situation. This phenomenon will inevitably affect the progress of the entire suppression of the rebellion, and may even be unable to support the continuation of the war to suppress the rebellion.

He gave a detailed analysis of the psychology of "defeatists" to this reporter, saying: They saw the "defeats" of today's suppression of the rebellion, and thought that it was due to the poor fighting of the front-line troops, or improper command. They believed that the overall situation had evolved to today and could not be reversed.

Ambiguous Attitude Is Poisonous

People with an "ambiguous attitude" are intentionally or unintentionally poisoned by Communist propaganda, believing that the Kuomintang's governance is for the benefit of the people, and that the Communist Party will also work for the benefit of the people when it comes, and even have greater expectations for the poor, who can "turn over" and the targets of the liquidation are the wealthy, which has nothing to do with the people.

Now, many people are unaware of being poisoned by such toxins, and they also spread rumors and pass them on, unknowingly acting as propagandists for the Communist Party. Communist Party members use deception and tricks in this kind of toxin to deliberately render the sins of war on the Kuomintang, disconnecting the people from the government, and creating a deep gap, which is the most terrible social phenomenon.

Be Vigilant and Strive to Correct Mistakes

Mr. Hu emphasized: "We must be vigilant about the mistakes of the past, strengthen the construction of mental defenses, so that every Chinese people can be united in the great cause of suppressing the rebellion and building the country, and recognize that today's war to suppress the rebellion is against aggression and for freedom." Because the Communist Party's rebellion in China has its international background, its goals, and its doctrines. On the other hand, we must now understand that we are fighting for the survival of the nation and the country, and even for world peace. Therefore, our suppression of the rebellion today is a war against aggression. It is neither a civil war nor a war to protect the privileged class.

Mr. Hu further discussed that the people under the rule of the Communist Party have no freedom and no equality. He cited the facts in the Soviet Union and the areas in China controlled by the Communist Party as evidence, believing that the Communist Party is higher than everything, and everything belongs to the Party. As long as the minority of Communist Party leaders think it is in their interest, then the people must unconditionally obey. Therefore, the Communist Party's governance is a centralized dictatorship, with no freedom for the people.

Strive for Freedom and Achieve Equality

Dr. Sun Yat-sen showed us that the Chinese national revolution is to seek freedom and equality for China. Therefore, we demand freedom for the survival of the nation and the country, and we also demand freedom for our own survival. The freedom we seek is true freedom, not false freedom.

Mr. Hu also talked about the Communist Party's revolution is to seize power by violence, and to use "land reform," "turning over," etc. as slogans, but the Kuomintang's revolution is to achieve the goal of the revolution - people's livelihood - by peaceful means. Therefore, the Kuomintang is the most suitable political party for China's national conditions, and the Three People's Principles are a revolutionary doctrine that aims to solve people's livelihood as its ultimate goal.

Mr. Hu concluded: "Wake up the 'defeatists' and those with an 'ambiguous attitude,' quickly strengthen the construction of mental defenses, and complete the great cause of suppressing the rebellion and building the country."

### The Pulsation of Rong City

— Special Correspondent Zheng Shizhu for this Newspaper

[Airmail Dispatch from Fuzhou, This Newspaper, 12th] Among the provincial capitals of the coastal provinces, Fuzhou is the most backward. Since the evacuation began from the Beijing and Shanghai area, Fuzhou has been regarded by the general public as a land of ease and comfort. Prices here are lower, transportation is still relatively convenient, and the climate is also relatively mild. Although it is the season of severe winter, as long as it is a sunny day, it is as warm as spring.

Since the evacuees flocked to Rong, the housing shortage has become even more severe. Renting a house is very difficult, and buying a house is not easy either. A wooden house is priced at twenty taels of gold. Fuzhou has insufficient electricity, no running water, and no sanitary facilities to speak of. The relatively decent houses are pitifully few, but most of the petty officials and common people, as long as they have relatives and friends in Fuzhou, have come here. Important figures such as the families of Gu Zhutong, Hang Liwu, Fan Hanjie, and Lin Wei have all arrived in Rong. The agencies relocated from Beijing to Rong include the Air Force Fourth Supply Sub-Bureau and a portion of the Navy. Personnel and equipment are continuously arriving in Rong via special ships.

The Fuzhou Airport during the evacuation period has suddenly become extremely busy. On the 10th alone, 26 special planes arrived, and on the 11th, 14 planes arrived. However, the Fuzhou Airport is small, and the extent of damage has gradually become unusable. The Air Force Headquarters has decided to expand it, expanding the original 226 mu of area to 798 mu, building cement runways, hangars, hardstanding, barracks, etc. However, due to the excessive requisition of nearby paddy fields, villagers are greatly alarmed. A village woman named Huang Lin committed suicide out of despair because only a few mu of her farmland were requisitioned. Also, Yi Huang, because of this, became mentally disturbed, and cursed at the airport all day long. The villagers are now actively requesting subsidies for the requisitioned land, but there are no concrete results at this moment.

Fuzhou Yiting Airport has seen frequent takeoffs and landings of planes passing through in recent days. However, the airfield is small, the facilities are rudimentary, and the runway is scattered with rough stones, which is unsuitable for both takeoff and landing. The authorities, recognizing the current importance of Fuzhou Airport, have transported a large batch of cement and construction personnel, and it is expected that construction will begin within the month to rebuild the cement runway, and it is planned to expand the runway to 1,800 meters, so that giant aircraft can take off and land without hindrance in the future.

The locals are inherently more conservative, and because of the unique language, the city and countryside are adding many out-of-town visitors, resulting in many amusing incidents. However, there are also many wounded and sick soldiers in Rong, scattered throughout the city and countryside, causing the locals to be infinitely worried and fearful.
