### Cheng Qian Flies from Hunan to Nanjing

[Ta Kung Pao, Nanjing, 2nd] Cheng Qian, Director of the Changsha Pacification Headquarters and Chairman of Hunan Province, arrived in Nanjing at 5:15 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd on the special "Zhuiyun" plane in response to Acting President Li's invitation.

Li Yuqing, Acting President Li's personal representative, Liu Shiyi, He Yingqin's representative, Bai Chongxi, Gu Zhutong, He Yaozu, Qiu Changwei, Huang Xuecun, Cheng Siyuan, Fan Yushui, Zhang Yaoming, Teng Jie, Zhang Zhen, Wei Yongcheng, and dozens of Legislative and Supervisory Committee members, National Assembly representatives, and Hunan natives welcomed him at the airport. After disembarking, Cheng Qian shook hands with the welcomers one by one and, at the request of reporters, gave a speech in the airport lounge. He began by saying that peace was the hope of the people of the whole country, and as Hunan was a part of the country, he of course hoped that peace could be achieved. When a reporter asked if now was the time for peace talks, Cheng Qian replied without hesitation: "Now is a very good time to talk peace." However, when asked about the Communist Party's eight conditions, Cheng Qian avoided criticism. According to Cheng Qian, Hunan is currently very stable. There have been occasional disturbances by small groups of bandits in western Hunan recently, but these are local bandits and not Communists. Cheng Qian denied the rumor that Hunan Province had issued provincial currency, saying that he had not brought any suggestions or reform plans with him. When asked about the issue of unity, Cheng Qian said that they should have united long ago. Finally, Cheng Qian said that it had been a long time since his last visit to Nanjing, and that the situation had changed and was now much better than the last time he came. After the speech, Cheng Qian went to the Capital Hotel to rest.

### Partial Government Reorganization Soon to Become a Reality

[Our Newspaper Report] A partial government reorganization is soon to become a reality, as the Ministries of Education, Judicial Administration, and Health in the Executive Yuan are currently without ministers, and the Ministers of Agriculture and Forestry, Social Affairs, and Transportation have firmly resigned. There are also political committee members who have resigned or are unable to perform their duties, such as Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, and Lin Keji. Therefore, reorganization is a factual necessity. It is also heard that the newly appointed replacements may be mostly figures from the Gui clique. Gu Mengyu has also been invited. Huang Shaohong may take over as Minister of Social Affairs. The Youth Party's ministers and political committee members Zuo Shunsheng and Lin Keji have previously resigned, and no final decision has been made yet. Zuo is scheduled to go to Nanjing on the 3rd for discussions.

[Our Newspaper Report] When Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, and Jiang Yong arrived at Longhua Airport yesterday afternoon, Mayor Wu also went to meet them. After Yan got off the plane, he immediately said to Mayor Wu: "I have the Shanghai problem and your problem to discuss with you." The Mayor smiled and asked: "What problem do I have? How is Shanghai?" Yan replied, "That's your business." Wu then asked, "Are there any specific solutions?" Yan said: "Very good." At 12:20 PM, they each got into cars and returned to their residences. Mayor Wu then drove to Yan Huiqing's residence in the afternoon at 3 PM for a long conversation, leaving only after half an hour. Ling Xianyang of Shanghai University also visited in succession. Another peace representative, Zhang Shizhao, visited Du Yuesheng to exchange views. It is generally speculated that the topic of discussion was centered on the future of Shanghai.

### Three Elders, Yan, Zhang, and Jiang, Arrive in Shanghai, Saying the Door-Knocking Mission Has Been Completed but They Are Not Concerned with the Peace Negotiation Terms. Zhang Qun and Yu Youren Had Long Conversations With the Four Gentlemen.

[Our Newspaper Report] The group of three peace elders, Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, and Jiang Yong, flew back to Shanghai from Nanjing on the afternoon of the 2nd. The envoys responsible for the door-knocking mission have finally completed their task. Those who went to Longhua Airport to meet them yesterday included Mayor Wu Guozhen, representing Acting President Li, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Gu Chunfan, and the families of Yan, Jiang, and Zhang. After Yan Huiqing got off the plane, he said to reporters: "If both sides can be open and honest, they can definitely talk. As the ancient saying goes: 'Do not do unto others what you would not want done unto yourself.' If we adhere to this principle and treat each other with sincerity, we will definitely succeed." Yan seemed satisfied with his trip to Beiping, but still emphasized that "there are still many difficulties, but there is great hope." When asked about the Communist Party's attitude towards punishing war criminals, Yan said: "We don't care about these conditions. Our mission is to knock on the door. Now we have accomplished our mission and opened the door. It is up to both sides to conduct peace talks." When asked if Yan would go to Nanjing or Beiping again, Yan replied: "No. After this, it's a matter for the government." Yan also said that the people hope for peace, so we conveyed the people's opinions to the Communist Party, and the Communist Party also understands. When asked if the Communist Party's views on peace were consistent, Yan said: "I don't know. In Beiping, we met all the important people of the Communist Party, and we have heard all their opinions. Now we have reported this situation to the government." Yan and others declined to disclose any other details about their time in Beiping.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] Yan, Jiang, and Zhang returned to Shanghai from Nanjing on the morning of the 2nd. Shao Lizi did not travel with them. Zhang Qun visited the four members of the peace delegation on the morning of the 2nd to exchange views on the peace issue, engaging in a conversation for almost two hours. In addition, Yu Youren, Gan Jiehou, Cheng Shewo, Cheng Cangbo, and others also visited. After the talks, Yan and others went to the airport. Before boarding the plane, Zhang Shizhao said to Shao: "Please take care of everything." This confirmed that the continued contact between the delegation and the government would be Shao's responsibility. Yan Huiqing also repeatedly said to Shao Lizi before leaving: "Please take care of everything, I beg you! I beg you!" Yan also told reporters that "we must slowly walk towards the road to peace. If the government needs us to come to Nanjing, we can still come at any time." It is said that after Yan, Jiang, Zhang, and Shao returned to Nanjing this time, only two or three government officials were able to learn about the content of their conversations with the Communist Party, in addition to the report to Acting President Li. Therefore, rumors that the delegation brought back the Communist Party's conditions, such as concessions on the issue of war criminals but insistence on reorganizing the army, are mostly speculations. In fact, the Communist Party would not present specific conditions to the peace delegation. Their greatest achievement was to communicate the views of both the North and the South on peace. The number of representatives from both sides will be the same in future negotiations. The Communist Party's representatives have already been determined, and the government's representatives are currently being discussed. Huang Shaohong is still firmly resigning and has already gone from Nanjing to Hong Kong. The government will find a suitable replacement, and the other three may not be changed.

### People's Representatives May Also Be Present

[Our Newspaper Report] According to sources close to the Shanghai peace delegation: The Communist Party has agreed that in future peace talks, in addition to official government representatives, people's representatives may also be present. Gan Jiehou will come to Shanghai in the next day or two to discuss this matter with people from all walks of life in the city. Yan Huiqing is also scheduled to hold a press conference in the next two to three days to report on his trip to the north.

### Communist Party Monitoring Taiwan

[Our Newspaper Report] In its radio news broadcasts, the Communist Party has repeatedly mentioned the Taiwan issue in recent days, which is enough to show its monitoring trend. Yesterday's broadcast also announced that Taiwanese compatriots in Beiping held a "February 28th" Revolution second anniversary commemoration meeting in Beiping on February 28th. Zhao Yimin, Minister of Propaganda of the Communist Party's Beiping Municipal Committee, as well as Chen Qiyuan, Zhang Naiqi, Tian Han, An E, and others attended. The conference passed a resolution to pay tribute to Mao and Zhu and issued a letter to compatriots across the country, stating that the Kuomintang is signing secret agreements with American imperialism in an attempt to sell Taiwan to the United States and turn Taiwan into an American colony. "If we want to smash the reactionary rule of the last bastion of the Kuomintang reactionaries, only under the leadership of the Communist Party can Taiwan be liberated, and only then can the people of Taiwan obtain true democracy and freedom."

[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 1st] The "Taiwan Liberation League" issued a statement today, reiterating its appeal to the people of Taiwan to unite and establish "a democratic Republic of Taiwan." A spokesman for the League said: When the United Nations General Assembly meets in April, the League will send representatives to Lake Success to raise the issue of Taiwan's independence. People from the Nationalist government said that the League only represents "a very small number of elements who previously cooperated with Japan." However, well-informed observers believe that its foundation is more extensive. Recently, General MacArthur announced that Taiwan is still subordinate to the Allied Supreme Command and is only "occupied" by China until a peace treaty with Japan is signed, which has a stimulating effect on the League's activities. Neutral parties attach great importance to the recent trip to Japan by some members of the League.

### Economic Cooperation Administration to Submit New Legislation to the US Congress for Aid to China; Estimated Monthly Need is US$20 Million

[United States Information Service, Washington, 1st] Lapham, Director of the China Division of the Economic Cooperation Administration, told reporters on the afternoon of the 1st: The Economic Cooperation Administration will "soon" submit new legislation for economic aid to China to Congress, but the Administration has not yet made any requests for the necessary funds or made any estimates.

Lapham said: The Economic Cooperation Administration currently needs approximately US$20 million per month for its aid program in non-Communist-occupied areas where the Administration is working, but he denied rumors that he had told the Supervisory Committee that the Economic Cooperation Administration would need US$240 million per year to continue aid to China. He explained that this was only an estimate based on the current level at the request of the members of the Committee. He also said: "If our policy stipulates that we will not continue to work in Communist-occupied areas, we will not need as much as US$240 million."

He said that he supports continuing economic aid to China, but he believes that the "smartest thing to do" at present is to extend the legislative authority to allow the current plan to be implemented until the end of June this year (currently, according to Congress's approval, this plan can only be implemented until April 3rd).

Lapham also said that the Chinese Communist Party "at least for the time being" seems to be staying on the north bank of the Yangtze River north of Shanghai, but "if they really want to move forward, there is no way to stop them." He said: If they really take over Shanghai, "I believe that our work in that area will largely be suspended." He also said that the goods stored by the Economic Cooperation Administration in Shanghai are mainly raw cotton, which can be used for about six weeks. He also estimated that when the Communist army took over Beiping and Tianjin, there were more than US$4 million worth of Economic Cooperation Administration supplies in those two places, including more than US$3.5 million worth of cotton textiles, and the rest was wheat and flour.

Lapham also said that before leaving China, he had suggested allocating US$500,000 from the Economic Cooperation Administration fund specifically for helping Chinese students in the United States. This suggestion has been agreed to in principle by the State Department, and the Economic Cooperation Administration and the State Department are currently discussing detailed implementation plans.

### Garrison Headquarters and Police Headquarters Separately Announce Details of the Conspiracy to Subvert the Government Case; Masterminds Wang Baozhen, Lin Difie, and Wu Rong are Apprehended

[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday, the Garrison Headquarters announced the details of the shocking case of a conspiracy to incite riots and subvert the government as follows: "The Shen Bao published on March 1st that the Nanjing and Shanghai security agencies cracked a major case of conspiracy to incite riots, attempt to create chaos, and subvert the government. After inquiring with relevant parties, we learned that several key criminals, including Wang Baozhen, Lin Difie, and Wu Rong, were also arrested in Shanghai. Wang Baozhen studied in Japan, participated in the Tongmenghui, and served as a member of the war zone party and government committee during the July 7th Incident. He is the mastermind behind the major case of conspiracy to incite riots and subvert the government. All the criminals arrested in Nanjing, as well as Xu Zhiyuan, Lin Difie, Wu Rong, and others, were under his command. Xu Zhiyuan was responsible for the organization and training of the reactionary organization, Lin Difie was responsible for propaganda, and Wu Rong was the secretary. Other conspirators are still under investigation."

Mastermind Wang Baozhen Travelled Between Hong Kong and Shanghai

The headquarters did not disclose the source of the leads and the circumstances of the case, nor did they reveal the specific plans of the reactionary organization's conspiracy. However, it was learned that during the arrests, the headquarters seized some documentary evidence such as documents and telegrams. The mastermind, Wang Baozhen, is from Shenze, Hebei Province, is 70 years old, and is a graduate of Waseda University in Japan. He joined the Tongmenghui in his early years. In the early years of the Republic of China, he was elected as a senator from Zhili Province. He founded the Minzhu Bao in Tianjin and strongly opposed Yuan Shikai's attempt to become emperor. In 1928, he served as a member of the Legislative Yuan and resigned soon after. Later, he joined the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee led by Li Jishen and held the title of Military Commissioner. He was also one of the representatives of the New Political Consultative Conference. This person came to Shanghai from Hong Kong in June last year to preside over a secret organization and has since frequently traveled between Hong Kong and Shanghai. After the case broke out, he and Lin Difie were first arrested in a private residence. It is said that the garrison personnel went to great lengths to find their address. In addition to Wang Baozhen, Lin Difie, and Wu Rong, there are two other suspects arrested in Shanghai in this case who are considered more important, but the Garrison Headquarters did not disclose their names yesterday.

Spokesman Luo Chunbo of the Garrison Headquarters Speaks

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] Luo Chunbo, Director of the Political Work Department and spokesman for the Capital Garrison Headquarters, said: (A) This headquarters did indeed crack a conspiracy to incite riots in the capital earlier this month. On February 5th, this headquarters received a tip that Meng Shiheng, Director of the Central Committee and Nanjing Branch of the Chinese Revolutionary Committee, was holding a secret meeting with a liaison officer from the Communist Jianghuai Military Region at Wu Shiwen's home at 2 Daguang New Village, Daguang Road, Nanjing, at 8 PM on February 6th, plotting a riot in the capital. This headquarters then arrested the key personnel in charge of the case and captured Meng Shiheng in Shanghai and brought him to Nanjing for interrogation. According to his confession: The plan was real. The methods were as follows: (1) Control the airport, (2) Cut off traffic arteries, (3) Detain Acting President Li and important military and government leaders, (4) Establish the Nanjing People's Liberation Committee, (5) Establish the Nanjing People's Government, (6) Meet the Communist army crossing the river, and use various hometown associations, fraternity associations, and other methods to carry out military transport, constitution transport, and police transport work plans, colluding with 5,000 people, with 2,000 people rioting in the city and 3,000 people meeting the Communist army crossing the river, and sending someone to contact the Communist army for internal support. Other prisoners also admitted to participating in the organization. For example, Xia Benying, a female National Assembly representative, was the director of the organization's women's committee.

Meng Shiheng is the Person in Charge in Shanghai

(B) According to Meng Shiheng's confession, it was learned that there was also such an organization in Shanghai. Xu Zhiyuan, Commissioner of the Supervisory Committee of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, was an important person in charge of the Shanghai organization. This headquarters then sent personnel to Shanghai to arrest Xu and bring him to Nanjing in conjunction with the Songhu Garrison Command. He is currently being secretly interrogated. (C) This case is a case of conspiracy to subvert the government through military riots and is not a political party or political prisoner issue. This headquarters is responsible for defending the capital and had to take emergency measures to arrest the necessary personnel, but it acted very cautiously and did not want to implicate anyone who was not an important member of the organization. The rumor that 70 or 80 people were involved is completely untrue. This headquarters did not arrest Qin Xiuqing and her friends. (There are some discrepancies between the report in our newspaper the day before and the facts). (D) This case is still under investigation. Once the investigation is completed, it will be reported to the higher authorities for approval. After the case is closed, if it is deemed necessary, it will be announced.

Qin Xiuqing Has Already Regained Her Freedom

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] Meng Shiheng's wife, Qin Xiuqing, bought a copy of our newspaper at our Nanjing office on the afternoon of the 2nd. According to her, she was only under surveillance once, but she regained her freedom in a few days. However, according to Director Luo of the Garrison Headquarters, she was not arrested.

Tao Hongzhao of Zhenjiang Has Also Been Arrested

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 2nd] Tao Hongzhao, former Zhenjiang Garrison Commander, who was dismissed and placed under surveillance for corruption, was also involved in the conspiracy to subvert the government. It is said that he had secretly contacted the Communist army in northern Jiangsu, plotting to use his authority to detain the party and government leaders of Jiangsu Province when the Communist army launched a crossing-the-river offensive, causing the local order to fall into chaos and cutting off the Jinghu traffic, so that the capital's riot would succeed in one fell swoop. However, due to the secrecy of the matter, he was arrested, which affected the progress of his entire plan.

Editorial

### The Brewing of a Southeast Asian League

The crisis in Southeast Asia is deepening daily, and there is hardly a country that is not in turmoil. The Indonesian problem remains unresolved, and the newly independent Burma has recently experienced a rebellion by the Karen people, who are currently attacking Mandalay, Burma's second-largest city, with military force. If the central government of Burma cannot obtain substantial and effective foreign aid, it will be difficult to control the national situation. At the same time, a so-called "rebellion by reactionary elements" has also occurred in the capital of Siam, disrupting all external transportation in Bangkok. Judging from the trend of this situation, it can be seen that the situation in Southeast Asia is deteriorating. If there is no way to reverse it, it may develop to an irreversible point. In view of this, Indian Prime Minister Nehru convened a Southeast Asian British Commonwealth Conference on the 28th of last month to discuss the Burmese problem, hoping to start with resolving the Burmese problem and then seek the stability of the entire Southeast Asia. Therefore, the British Commonwealth Conference held in New Delhi will not only thoroughly resolve Burma's internal problems and seek political and economic stability for Burma, but also take concrete and effective measures, such as organizing a Southeast Asian anti-communist alliance, to protect themselves, resist foreign aggression, and seek the stability of the entire Southeast Asia.

In addition to the British representative, Southeast Asian High Commissioner MacDonald, and the Minister of Overseas Trade, Bottomley, attending this British Commonwealth Conference, there were also representatives from five Commonwealth countries: India, Ceylon, Pakistan, Australia, and New Zealand. The conference was chaired by the initiator, Indian Prime Minister Nehru. The main agenda items were: one, the Burmese problem, and two, the issue of organizing a Southeast Asian anti-communist alliance.

Regarding the Burmese problem, the representatives attending the meeting expressed their regret that a rebellion occurred soon after Burma's independence. However, because the safety of Burma has a profound and significant impact on the interests of Britain and India, and also has a major relationship with Southeast Asia, the representatives of the various Commonwealth countries particularly raised awareness of the Burmese problem in Southeast Asia, so they unanimously agreed that a way should be found to achieve a peaceful solution to the Burmese problem. However, the representatives' opinions were not entirely consistent on what steps should be taken to resolve the issue. Some advocated that Burma should cancel its independence and return to the embrace of Britain. Australian Foreign Minister Evatt once publicly pointed out that Burma's severance of ties with the British Empire was a mistake. However, others believed that economic aid alone was not enough to restore peace and prosperity to Burma, so they advocated some form of mediation. After the debate, a moderate approach was adopted, namely, to send a telegram to Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu in the name of the Southeast Asian Commonwealth Conference, proposing to seek a peaceful solution and frankly stating that economic aid to Burma would be conditional on the Burmese government reaching an agreement with the Karen people. This resolution is appropriate, and Burma's internal strife can be expected to be resolved peacefully as a result, adding another factor to the stability of Southeast Asia.

As for the issue of organizing a Southeast Asian anti-communist alliance, because the content is complex, it cannot be achieved overnight. But what is most noteworthy is that the threat of communist forces felt by Southeast Asian countries is already a clear and obvious fact. Since the rise of the Chinese Communist Party, the southward invasion of Asian communist forces has intensified day by day, which no one can deny. Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaya, Siam, and Burma need not be mentioned, even the Philippines and India have already felt its threat. Recently, Indian Prime Minister Nehru reported to the parliament, also sternly criticizing the Communist Party for attempting to conspire a rebellion in India, he said: "The Indian Communist Party, taking advantage of the rise of the Chinese, Malayan, and Burmese Communist Parties, also wants to disrupt order in India and wants to overthrow the government by force. Fortunately, the government has taken decisive measures, and the Communist Party's conspiracy has failed. In the past ten days, as many as 870 people have been arrested for riots that were close to open rebellion." This is the real situation in India, and it is also a true reflection of the turbulent situation in Southeast Asian countries. If the situation in India is like this, it goes without saying that the situation in other countries is even worse.

As mentioned above, communist forces have long infiltrated Southeast Asian countries, and recently, due to the military success of the Chinese Communist Party, their arrogance has increased like a prairie fire. Indian Prime Minister Nehru initiated the Southeast Asian Commonwealth Conference, ostensibly for the internal turmoil in Burma, but in reality, wasn't it for the Southeast Asian anti-communist alliance? At the same time, for the sake of its own sense of security, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt also strongly advocated that Southeast Asia should establish an organization similar to the Western European Union to resist foreign aggression. According to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 28th, it is very likely that a Southeast Asian defense plan will be established. One is that everyone believes that India alone has the strength to become an anti-communist bastion; the other is that the Australian Foreign Minister is not to be outdone, believing that since Britain is busy with European affairs and has no time to look east, Australia should come out to lead the various Commonwealth countries in anti-communist self-defense. Based on this, it is highly probable that this Southeast Asian British Commonwealth Conference will decide to organize a Southeast Asian anti-communist alliance. In the past, it was often said that China was a stabilizing force in East Asia, and the world should pay attention to ensuring that this stabilizing force does not waver. It is a pity that there were too many short-sighted people, and now they may gradually feel that the wildfire is about to burn over. For the sake of peace and prosperity in Southeast Asia, we certainly hope that Southeast Asian countries will be able to establish this kind of self-defense alliance, but we still need to awaken all countries in the world that if China is not stable for a day, and China is invaded for a day, then Southeast Asia will not be stable for a day, and there will be a danger of being invaded for a day. Looking afar at Southeast Asia, we cannot but look back at how China's overall situation will evolve.

### Finalizing Revenue and Expenditure to Stabilize Finance - Further Improvement in Import and Export Trade - Minister of Finance Hsu Clarifies the Hopes for the New Financial Plan in Shanghai

[Report from this newspaper] Minister of Finance Hsu Kan arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 2nd. In the afternoon at 5 o'clock, he received reporters. Mr. Hsu said: The purpose of the reception is "to frankly explain to everyone the intention and future hopes of this promulgated financial reform plan."

Mr. Hsu first stated: The new plan is divided into: (1) Finance, (2) Finance, (3) Import and export trade, (4) Material adjustment, (5) Material production departments. Departments (4) and (5) are not under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance, so only the first three departments will be explained. Briefly stated: The main purpose of the first department, finance, is to seek the verification of income and expenditure, thereby reducing the imbalance between income and expenditure. The revision of tax collection methods can be exemplified by the fact that tariffs are now paid in Customs Gold Units. The use of Customs Gold Units to pay import taxes does not reduce the use of Gold Yuan Certificates. After the implementation of Customs Gold Units, as long as the Yangtze River shipping remains smooth, it is estimated that tariffs can generate at least US$30 million per year. This greatly helps to balance financial revenue and expenditure. Excise taxes on five items, cotton yarn, cement, matches, cigarettes, and sugar, will all be levied in kind. After the government collects them in kind, it will have a large amount of materials to adjust market supply and demand. However, it will not increase the burden on each factory. Among the direct taxes, the profit-seeking enterprise income tax is now determined to adopt an assessed package payment system to achieve the principle of simple tax collection. Regarding salt tax, recently, due to insufficient capital turnover for some salt merchants and distributors, it has been decided to conduct official collection and transportation of a portion of edible salt. As for the expenditure side, it also seeks verification. The largest expenditure now is military expenditure. Because the country cannot afford it, the impact is on the corruption of discipline. After the military expenditure is increased, the morale can be expected to be boosted. Since there are many public and educational personnel and organizations, the national treasury bears a heavy burden. Therefore, in the future, it is determined to reduce and merge redundant organizations as much as possible. At the same time, efforts will be made to improve the treatment of public and educational personnel so that they can work with peace of mind. Also, in order to make the financial resources of local governments abundant, the central government has decided to assign the land tax to the local governments starting from October 1, 1949. Without hindering the central tax system, local governments can also determine their own tax systems.

The main aspect of the second department, finance, is to open up the free trading of gold and silver and allow silver dollars to circulate. This move is not to restore the silver standard, but to respect reality and facilitate the people. It is believed that after the free trading of gold and silver, the Central Bank can use greater strength to stabilize the market. At the same time, it is planning to increase the casting of silver dollars.

Regarding the third part, import and export trade, it has been improved compared to before since the Executive Yuan announced the new measures in November last year, and now it is further improved. (1) Exporters can handle imports themselves without restrictions. (2) Regarding imports, except for six items, cigarettes, petroleum products, food, cotton, and fertilizers, which still maintain a quota system, all others are relaxed as much as possible. (3) Imports with self-provided foreign exchange are also relaxed as much as possible. In the future, overseas remittances will not have a difference from the listed price of US dollars, and overseas remittances will not be evaded. However, the opening of gold and silver is still a kind of commodity trading, so import duties are still collected on the import of gold and silver.

Mr. Hsu concluded by saying: This new plan will never sing a high tune, and it is hoped that the current financial situation can be relatively stabilized. However, to demand that this plan be fully effective today, we must still see whether the peace talks can achieve reasonable results and whether there is a solution to the overall situation. Whether the implementation of the new plan is effective is the main key. Regarding the detailed rules for the implementation of the new plan, Mr. Hsu said that they are still being drafted and will be completed within days, and will be announced and implemented after being approved by the Executive Yuan.

### The Whereabouts of the Cruiser "Chongqing" Are Unknown: It Sailed from the Whangpoo River on the 26th of Last Month, Destination Unknown; Gui Yongqing Claims It Has Reached Bohai Bay

[Report from Our Newspaper] The whereabouts of the cruiser "Chongqing" remain a mystery. The relevant authorities have yet to determine whether its departure was an escape, a purely political act, or due to other reasons. According to reliable sources, the "Chongqing" sailed from the Whangpoo River on February 26th, likely beginning its action at dusk. February 26th was a Saturday, also a weekend holiday. That afternoon, some officers and soldiers of the ship went ashore to enjoy the weekend, but to their surprise, when they returned to the dock that night, they could not find the ship. The Shanghai office of the Naval Headquarters telegraphed Nanjing on the morning of the 27th to report this. Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing rushed to order the handling of the matter. It is said that the ship carried 500,000 silver dollars prepared by the Naval Headquarters to pay the officers and soldiers and serve as emergency funds. In addition to the ship's captain, Deng Zhaoxiang, there was also a certain head of the Operations Department of the Naval Headquarters on board. The Naval Headquarters is now trying to establish telecommunications contact with the ship. The "Chongqing" is the newest and best-performing warship in our country's navy. The Naval Headquarters authorities are extremely distressed by the ship's disappearance and are now doing everything possible to find it. Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing will also broadcast to the ship's officers and soldiers in the coming days, explaining the importance of national interest and urging them to return soon.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Naval Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing came to Shanghai on official business. When asked by reporters about the whereabouts of the warship "Chongqing," Gui replied, "The ship has now sailed to Bohai Bay, and I have telegraphed the captain to sail back here immediately." He refused to disclose anything further. In the evening, Gui and the director of the Jiangnan Shipyard visited Liu Gongyun, the president of the National Bank of China, to discuss loan matters for the shipyard.

[United Press Report from This City] A government naval spokesman admitted tonight that the cruiser "Chongqing" had sailed from the mouth of the Yangtze River on the 24th of last month and has not been heard from since. However, he neither confirmed nor denied the rumor that the ship is now under the control of the Chinese Communists in Yantai. The spokesman did not mention that government air force had spotted the ship in the waters of North China.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 2nd] A government spokesman admitted on the 2nd that a naval transport ship had sailed to the Communist area, but he said that he had not learned the name or tonnage of the ship. Regarding the rumor that the 5,000-ton cruiser "Chongqing" had sailed to Yantai to surrender to the Communist army, he said that he had not received such a report.

[Report from Our Newspaper] In recent days, a senior official of the British Far East Fleet has been in frequent contact with Commander-in-Chief Gui, and it is widely believed that the two sides must have discussed the disappearance of the "Chongqing" and may have also touched on the issue of the destroyer "Lingfu." The "Lingfu" was leased to us by the United Kingdom for five years when they gave us the "Chongqing."

### A Former Crew Member of the "Lingfu" Is Now a Department Store Clerk: Recounting the Past with Tears of Resentment

[Reuters Report from This City] A former crew member of the destroyer "Lingfu," which was transferred from Britain to China at the same time as the cruiser "Chongqing," told this agency about the disappearance of the "Chongqing" two days ago. He believed that the main reason for the disappearance of the "Chongqing" was the immense disappointment caused by the meager treatment after the excellent young naval officers of the two ships received two years of training in England and enjoyed the same preferential treatment as their British counterparts. After the two ships sailed across the ocean from England to Shanghai, half of the crew members of the two ships requested permission from their superiors to return to their hometowns to visit relatives. Most of those who made such requests expressed their determination to leave the Chinese Navy regardless of the tasks assigned to the two ships by the naval authorities. When the personnel of the two ships left England to return home, they were full of enthusiasm, but as soon as they arrived at the country's gate, it was like having a bucket of cold water poured over them. When they arrived in Shanghai, it was during Chiang Ching-kuo's strict enforcement of the currency restriction policy. The issue of treatment was the first thing that made the young officers on the ship feel dissatisfied. During their training in England, their treatment was equal to that of the British naval personnel. After arriving in Shanghai, each person's monthly salary was only 17 gold yuan. Their skills and experience were completely ignored. As soon as the two ships entered Chinese territorial waters, the distribution of British clothing and cigarettes was immediately cancelled, although there was still plenty of such inventory on board. The crew member also told this agency: "When I requested permission to go to Qingdao to visit relatives, I was not allowed to take British-made wool socks and blankets ashore, but afterwards, these wool socks and blankets were sold publicly on Beijing Road." The crew member also said: When the two ships arrived in Singapore and Hong Kong, the local Chinese gave them a warm welcome. When they arrived in Shanghai, the bad traditional atmosphere of the Chinese Navy was immediately brought into full play, making people feel that the two years of training in England were completely wasted. The crew member finally told this agency in a painful tone: I spent two years in England training to manage the boilers of warships, but today I am working in a department store selling ties. Is this where Chinese talent ends up? How sad it is. It is reported that the crew member has now left the navy and found a job on his own.

### The U.S. Orders Soviet Émigré Group to Leave the Country: The Situation in Berlin Suddenly Becomes Tense; The Group Refuses to Comply and Is Trapped in the Blockade; Pro-Soviet Elements Are Active and May Launch an Incident at Any Time

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 1st] U.S. Military Governor Clay announced today that if the Soviet émigré group in the U.S. zone does not leave the country by tomorrow morning, the U.S. authorities will cut off its water, electricity, gas, telephone, and other conveniences. The U.S. authorities believe that the group's work of sending Soviet émigrés back to the Soviet Union has long been completed, so they ordered it to leave the country today.

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 2nd] The tense relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in Germany has reached a serious climax due to the U.S. military government stationing armed guards in front of the general office of the Soviet émigré group here this morning, strictly prohibiting entry. The personnel of the Soviet émigré group are actually trapped in a blockade. U.S. Military Governor Clay, considering the seriousness of the situation, has telegraphed Washington for instructions in preparation for any eventuality. Frankfurt U.S. Commander Wut met with the head of the Soviet émigré group this morning, reiterating the demand that the Soviet émigré group must withdraw from the U.S. zone because its mission has been completed. The head of the Soviet group refused this request on the spot, stating that he would not withdraw unless he received an order to withdraw from Moscow. Afterwards, the U.S. authorities immediately sent armed guards to stand guard in front of the group's headquarters, prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving. Wut then suggested to the head of the Soviet group that the U.S. was willing to escort the group's personnel to the border of the Soviet zone, but the Soviet side refused again. Clay then ordered the cutting off of the group's electricity, telephone, and gas, thus completely isolating the group. After this news spread, many Germans gathered on the streets of Frankfurt, anticipating the occurrence of chaos. Pro-Soviet elements in the crowd were eager to try and may launch an incident at any time. The U.S. military authorities have also taken emergency precautionary measures. It is reported that the group was established based on the Potsdam Agreement to oversee the repatriation of Soviet refugees in the U.S. zone of Germany. Clay ordered the group to close last week, but was refused. Last night, Moscow sent a note to the U.S. Embassy protesting Clay's order to leave the country, stating that this action directly violated the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement. This morning, U.S. Commander Wut also ordered the Soviet émigré group to remove the Soviet flag in front of its office, but as of noon today, the Soviet flag was still flying. When Wut talked to reporters about this matter. Robertson (British), Cornish (French), and Shi Qi in Berlin are all closely watching the development of this matter. Although Robertson refused to comment, citing that this matter was a U.S. affair, he expressed moral support for Clay's attitude. Cornish said that it would not be difficult for the Soviet Union to launch an incident, because there are indeed pro-Soviet elements among the German people.

### British Prime Minister to Visit Germany Tomorrow: Four-Day Stay to Inspect Airlift Measures

[Reuters, London, 1st] It was officially announced here today that British Prime Minister Attlee is scheduled to visit Germany from the 4th to the 7th of this month to inspect the airlift measures of the British authorities in Germany.

According to the planned itinerary, Prime Minister Attlee will stay in Berlin from Friday midnight to Sunday morning, and will go to other parts of the British zone to inspect from Sunday morning. It is reported that Attlee's last trip to Berlin was in July 1945, when he attended the Potsdam Conference as the leader of the opposition party, accompanying Churchill.

[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] Germans close to the Soviet military government revealed that the news of British Prime Minister Attlee's scheduled visit to Germany surprised the Soviet military government. Semanov, the political adviser of Soviet Military Governor Sokolovsky, immediately went to Sokolovsky's residence in Potsdam for a long secret talk after receiving the news.

### Clay Proposes Restoring the German Shipbuilding Industry

[Reuters, Washington, 1st] News from here: The United States and Britain will soon hold negotiations to decide whether to allow Germany to build ships that sail the ocean. Clay, the U.S. Military Governor in Germany, recently proposed restoring the German shipbuilding industry and merchant fleet. It is said that Clay specifically advocated allowing Germany to build several 10,000-ton freighters and one 35,000-ton passenger ship. The U.S. Navy Department supports Clay's proposal, but other parties strongly oppose it. Clay's proposal is tantamount to setting aside the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement prohibiting Germany from building ocean-going ships. Officials here also gradually believe that this ban will eventually be relaxed to allow Germany to build ships that sail the coast and canals.

### The Soviet Union Plans to Create a Ruble Currency Zone: A Large Amount of Gold Reserves as Collateral

[Agence France-Presse, London, 1st] It is rumored here that the Soviet government intends to give the ruble international value and will create a ruble currency zone. Within this zone, exchange rates will be completely free. The value of the ruble exchange will be guaranteed by a large amount of gold accumulated by the Soviet Union over the past 30 years.

[Reuters, Washington, 1st] Authoritative sources here: In addition to stipulating the provision of assistance to Western European countries to resist any external aggression, the North Atlantic Treaty will also stipulate the provision of assistance to Western European countries to resist internal aggression. From this perspective, the North Atlantic Treaty is nothing more than a blueprint for the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance in the Western Hemisphere. The Western Hemisphere Treaty clearly stipulates that the advisory body established under this treaty may consider appropriate collective measures in the event of a dangerous threat, and this clause has also been included in the North Atlantic Treaty. It is reported that officials drafting the bill of the treaty have realized that the United States should not only supply Western Europe with the materials necessary to resist armed attacks, but also assist Western Europe in resisting the infiltration of communist forces. When Truman first launched the aid plan for Greece and Turkey, this principle had already been established.

### U.S. Army Authorities Reveal That U.S. Troops Stationed in Japan Will Be Increased: The Number Will Increase to 100,000 Starting This July

[Report from Our Newspaper] Washington, 2nd Broadcast. U.S. Army authorities revealed that the total number of U.S. troops stationed in Japan will not only not decrease, but will also increase by 12,000. According to the spokesman, starting from the 1950 fiscal year (starting on July 1st of this year), the total number of U.S. troops stationed in Japan can reach between 95,000 and 100,000, while at the end of 1948 it was only about 75,000 to 80,000. Recently, the military department announced at a press conference that the U.S. military authorities in the Far East had requested that the number of troops stationed be increased to 127,000. The military department spokesman also said: The U.S. Department of Defense has informed the British Commonwealth countries of the defense areas of the U.S. troops stationed in the Far East in the next year. MacArthur has four complete combat divisions, which proves the absurdity of the previous rumors that the U.S. troops stationed in Japan would be reduced.

### U.S. House Resolution to Abolish Racial Restrictions in Immigration Law

[United Press, Washington, 1st] The House of Representatives today passed a bill to lift racial restrictions in the Immigration and Naturalization Act. The original bill has been submitted to the Senate for discussion.

### The Philippines Recognizes South Korea

Korea Changes Its Envoy to China

[Reuter, Manila, 2nd] The Republic of the Philippines today officially recognized the government of South Korea led by Syngman Rhee. The official document was signed by Philippine President Quirino.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] The special envoy of South Korea stationed in Japan was recently sent to the United States due to special circumstances. His vacancy has been filled by the former ambassador to China, Huan Fan. As for the South Korean ambassador to China, before a new candidate is appointed, it will be temporarily replaced by Counselor Lee Jeong-bang.

### If an Agreement Cannot Be Reached with Indonesia, the Netherlands Will Withdraw from the Western European Union: The Mediation Committee Accuses the Netherlands of Disregarding the Security Council's Resolution

[United Press, The Hague, 1st] A Dutch spokesman hinted today that the Netherlands may withdraw from the Western European Five-Nation Economic Alliance. It is said that the solution to the Indonesian question is linked to the Netherlands' participation in the Western European Alliance. The success or failure of the Netherlands' agreement on the establishment of Indonesia will determine whether it is an important member of the Western European Alliance.

[United Press, Batavia, 2nd] The United Nations Mediation Committee submitted a report to the Security Council today, stating that the Dutch government's proposal to hold a round table conference between Indonesia and the Netherlands in The Hague still acted on its own accord and disregarded the Security Council's resolution of January 28th. The Security Council resolution demanded the release of the Indonesian Republic leaders, the restoration of the Indonesian Republic, the supervision of the Indonesian Federal Council elections, and the transfer of all sovereignty to the Indonesian Federation before July 1, 1950. The Netherlands has not yet accepted it. The report also stated that no agreement has been reached on the establishment of a federal provisional government. Neither Indonesia nor the Netherlands has conducted negotiations in accordance with the Security Council resolution. Two months after the Security Council ordered a ceasefire, the war in Indonesia has not stopped and is expanding. The fundamental factor in the Indonesian political deadlock is that the Dutch government does not allow the Indonesian Republic government to resume exercising its functions in Yogyakarta.

### U.S. Secretary of Defense and Secretary of the Army Reportedly to Retire in May: Voorhees to Be Responsible for Managing Occupation Affairs

[U.S. Information Agency, Washington, 1st] The U.S. Secretary of the Army announced that the Under Secretary of the Department, Voorhees, has succeeded Draper and, under the supervision of the Secretary of the Army, is responsible for managing the occupation affairs of Germany, Austria, Japan, Korea, and the special port.

### Israel Expresses Deep Gratitude for Our Country's Formal Recognition: The Security Council Will Discuss the Jewish People's Application Today

[Agence France-Presse, Tel Aviv, 2nd] Israeli President Weizmann received a congratulatory telegram from Chinese Acting President Li Zongren today, and Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok also received a congratulatory telegram from Chinese Foreign Minister Wu Tiecheng, hoping that the two countries would have friendly relations.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 1st] Israelis here are extremely pleased with China's recognition of Israel. Israeli Representative to the United Nations Eban wrote to Chinese Representative Jiang Tingfu, saying that Israeli culture originates from the Asian continent, so the Israeli people are very willing to contribute to the revival and development of Asian life and culture. For this reason, the formal recognition of Israel by the oldest country in Asia makes us even more grateful. Your government's actions are naturally valued by all Asian nations and are of great benefit to the promotion of peace and coordination.

When Jiang Tingfu talked about China's recognition of Israel, he said that this move would be of great benefit to promoting peace and the restoration of friendly relations in the Near East. China's action is not based on material interests.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 1st] The Security Council will meet on Thursday afternoon to discuss Israel's application to join the United Nations.

### The Inside Story of the Siamese Coup: Extremely Mysterious and Terrifying

[Agence France-Presse, Bangkok, 2nd] Both the Siamese Navy and Army have laid down their weapons and returned to their barracks. Well-informed sources said that the Luang Phibunsongkhram government, in order to adopt a compromise attitude towards the Navy, would consider allowing key naval personnel to enter the cabinet. The current Siamese government is still continuing to arrest civil officials related to this incident, most of whom are followers of former Prime Minister Pridi Banomyong. It is said that the fleet commander Phong Phong, who announced the establishment of the new cabinet by telegram, has now committed suicide.

### General MacArthur Sues British Newspaper Reporter: Soviet Union Could Attack Japan, America Determined to Help Japan, But Does Not Believe the Soviets Have the Power to Invade Japan

[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] General MacArthur told Mr. Brace, a reporter for the London Daily Mail, on the 1st: "If the Soviet Union attacks Japan, we are determined to defend it." But he continued: "I do not believe the Soviet Union will attack Japan." During the meeting at General MacArthur's headquarters, he frankly discussed Japan's position in the British and American strategy in the Pacific. He said: "If there is another major war, we do not want Japan to fight." MacArthur explained: "Japan's position is like Switzerland in the Pacific." The reporter asked: "What if Japan is attacked?" MacArthur said: "Well, we will certainly defend her." But he continued: "I don't believe the Soviet Union will attack Japan. Even if the Soviet government has the belief to invade Japan, it cannot be realized unless it has air supremacy and the Soviet Far East Fleet or a way to eliminate the American fleet." He said: "The Soviet Union cannot gain air supremacy. At the end of the war, the United States built twenty-five airfields on Okinawa, which can send out a maximum of 3,500 B-29 bombers every day. The entire East Asia, from Singapore to Vladivostok, is within the range of these aircraft." When asked about Japan's role in defense strategy, MacArthur replied: "We have always regarded Japan as an ally. We hope it will remain neutral, and we will help it become self-sufficient, so that we can reduce the burden of supplying it. I believe that in three or four years, Japan can be self-sufficient in food through domestic production or exchange exports for imported food."

American Strategy Entirely Changed by War

Although the Communist Party recently won in China, MacArthur believes that the interests of Britain and the United States in the Pacific are completely safe, and he is not worried about the Japanese Communist Party gaining votes in the general election. He said: "I don't think the Japanese Communist Party has any connection with Moscow." But he said: "American strategy has been completely changed by the war. Our defense preparations are based on the mainland, believing that the Pacific is the road for a possible enemy to attack. Now the Pacific has become an Anglo lake. Our route passes through a series of islands to the Asian coast. This line starts from the Philippines, passes through the Ryukyu Islands, including the main fortress of Okinawa, and then passes through Japan and the Aleutian Islands to Alaska. Although the victory of the Communist army in China has made them on the side of this position, it has not changed the fact that our possible enemy on the Asian continent does not have a nearby industrial base to supply amphibious attacks." MacArthur said: "The Soviet Union's war industry is in the Ural Mountains. Their mass-produced weapons and ammunition must rely on a 4,000-mile railway line to be transported to Vladivostok."

The Time is Not Yet Ripe for Establishing a Japanese Defense Force

When asked about the proposal that Japan should be "allowed" to establish a defense force, MacArthur replied: "This is a premature proposal. This is a question that can only be decided when drafting a peace treaty with Japan. Before the peace treaty is signed, the occupying forces will remain in Japan. This is not to suppress Japan—this is unnecessary—but because of the unfortunate division between the Allied powers during the war, we should give priority to defense of British and American interests." MacArthur said: "If Japan is attacked, recruiting troops to 'cooperate with us' is extremely easy." He pointed out that "the Japanese are the most stubborn infantry in the world." When the reporter mentioned that the Soviet Union once said that the Japanese police are the core of the future army, MacArthur did not agree. He said: "There are now 125,000 people, and their task is to maintain domestic order, and less than 20% of them carry pistols."

Although the Communist Party recently increased from four seats to 35 seats out of the 466 seats in the Japanese parliament, MacArthur does not believe that communism is a danger to Japan. He said: "This proportion may represent their actual strength. I do not believe that the Japanese Communist Party has a direct relationship with Moscow. Communism will not expand in this country where 48% are small farmers. The land reform that transfers the land of landlords to tenant farmers allows more people to have a stake in the country. I don’t think communism is more terrible in Japan than in Britain or the United States. MacArthur believes that the Japanese are deeply grateful for the new social concepts and the greater freedom given to them by the Allied occupation. He said: "Japanese workers have been cruelly exploited. Their wages are so low that they can barely make a living. We have allowed Japanese workers to form trade unions, eight-hour workdays, collective bargaining rights, and other benefits. I fully expect that a Labour Party can be established in Japan."

MacArthur's Impression Reminds People of Foch

Although the reporter has experience interviewing the most luxurious figures in the world, few conversations have made such a deep impression as MacArthur's. He used very fluent and good words to talk about everything from the strategy of the last war in Europe to the US government's policy towards China. MacArthur's fluency reminded the reporter of Foch and Chiang Kai-shek. His ability to explain complex problems is admirable. MacArthur wore a US military battle uniform, with five silver stars in a circle on each epaulet. His office is on the top floor of a building supported by marble pillars, formerly the office of an insurance company, facing the Japanese Imperial Palace. If MacArthur's father had been born a few months earlier, the 69-year-old MacArthur could claim British nationality. He said: "My grandfather was a Scotsman who lived in Glasgow. He went to the United States in 1842 at the age of thirty. My father was born soon after, and I grew up in the tradition of the MacArthur clan. I have never been to Scotland, but if the holiday is long enough, I will definitely go." MacArthur expressed the warmest feelings for the British and Australians. He served as commander-in-chief in Australia during the war. He said: "From the Prime Minister to the soldiers, I could not have more loyal support than they gave me." MacArthur's most admired person is Churchill. He corresponded with Churchill when he was the commander in Australia during the war. The reporter asked: "The Soviet Union has repeatedly interfered with the Allied occupying forces in Germany. Why don't you have any trouble with the Soviet Union?" MacArthur replied: "Perhaps because the Soviet Union's Oriental intelligence is the same as in the era of Genghis Khan, and I have many years of experience dealing with the Orient."

The Publication of the Interview Caused Another Controversy

[United Press, Tokyo, 2nd] A spokesman for MacArthur's headquarters press office said on the 2nd that MacArthur had not authorized London Daily Mail reporter Brace to publish an interview based on their conversation. The spokesman said that MacArthur had never given a declarative interview and has always forbidden it, only using it for background reference, not for publication. He said that Brace either misunderstood or violated his covenant.

But Brace claimed that before he met with MacArthur, MacArthur and Allied headquarters personnel never told him that the interview could not be published. Brace said that he had specifically asked Colonel Iglehart, the chief of the press department of MacArthur's headquarters, to find a way for him to "meet" with MacArthur, and then he achieved the purpose of meeting with MacArthur for about an hour on Monday.

### The Body in the Box was Transported from its Original Location to the Shanghai North Railway Station, Attracting Thousands of Spectators; a Suspicious Person on the Train was Detained in Kunshan; the Body was Sent to the Coroner's Office, and the Prosecutor's Office will Conduct an Examination Today

[Our Newspaper Report] The train box murder case, as a result of the efforts of the two railway police departments, has detained a suspect. It happened that the plainclothes detective, who was monitoring the corpse box on the 74th train the day before yesterday afternoon, discovered a suspicious person at Kunshan Station. After following and secretly monitoring him for a while, he was directly detained for interrogation. The corpse box was transported back to this city by the original train from Changzhou at 11:55 yesterday morning and sent to the coroner's office on Changde Road. The prosecutor's office has scheduled to send a prosecutor to examine the corpse at ten o'clock this morning. The police authorities hope that the family members of the victim will read the newspaper, discover it as soon as possible, come to Shanghai to identify the body, and provide clues to facilitate the investigation and solving of the case.

After the "body in the box" was discovered on the 74th train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway at 3:40 the day before yesterday afternoon, the railway police department immediately mobilized all plainclothes police officers to secretly deploy a detection network at each station on the two lines. The two leather boxes were still placed on the train as they were, and five detectives disguised as passengers secretly guarded them. The 74th train departed at 4:30 pm on the same day and arrived in Changzhou at 9 pm. The passengers in the car did not know that there were foreign objects hidden in these two leather boxes. After arriving at Changzhou Station, no one took these two boxes. There was no disturbance overnight at Changzhou Station, so when the train returned to Shanghai (73rd train) from Changzhou yesterday morning at 6 o'clock, the "body in the box" was still brought back by the original train. However, the plainclothes detective on the 74th train had noticed a suspicious person when the train departed from Shanghai North Station, because the corpse box was placed on the second third-class passenger car, which was originally converted from a fourth-class car. The equipment was relatively simple and close to the locomotive, with a lot of smoke and ash. Under normal circumstances, people would not enter this car until the passenger cars in the later sections were full. At that time, there was a man who sat in the second car after arriving at the platform. At that time, there were still few passengers in the other carriages, and the man frequently stared at the two boxes on the way, and constantly looked around at the passengers. His actions and demeanor were very unnatural. The train arrived at Kunshan and got off the train. Two detectives immediately followed and monitored him. Until the evening, because his suspicion was high, he was detained for interrogation.

### The Deceased was Tall and Robust in Life, with Traces of Ropes Remaining on the Ankles

The 73rd train carrying the "body in the box" arrived at North Shanghai Station at noon yesterday. Director Jin, who was handling the case, ordered two porters to move the box to the open space behind the third and fourth-class waiting rooms for detailed research. It was found that a corner of the remaining seal was left on one box, and the word "×" could be vaguely distinguished. In addition to the cotton batting and white cloth used to cover the corpse blocks in the box, an old black woolen women's coat, a yellow army blanket, and half a newspaper (possibly the Southeast Daily published in Hangzhou) were also found. Judging from the corpse blocks, the deceased must have been a strong, tall and robust person during his lifetime. There was a deep knife mark on the upper left eye of the head, and there were still traces of rope tied on the ankles. After the corpse was dismembered, it must have been carefully scrubbed and wiped, so the corpse blocks were unusually clean. Director Jin said that before the prosecutor's examination, it was inconvenient to move too much, so at 2:10 pm, it was still loaded in the original box in its original state and sent to the coroner's office by truck.

Traffic Congestion at North Railway Station

Unexpectedly, when the truck drove to the iron gate connecting the North Railway Station building and the square, a large number of curious citizens suddenly crowded in, surrounding the truck and scrambling to see the "body in the box". Although the escorting railway police tried to dissuade them, it was ineffective, and more and more people gathered, more than 10,000 people. The entrance gate of the North Railway Station was also blocked by the crowd, and cars and three-wheeled vehicles could not enter the station. The order was very chaotic for a while. According to personnel at the station, after residents nearby read the newspaper yesterday morning and learned about the strange case on the train, they came to the station in groups to inquire about the "body in the box". When the "body in the box" arrived in Shanghai at noon, it was very secretive, and the outside world rarely knew about it. It was not noticed until it was loaded on the truck and prepared to be sent to the coroner's office. This kind of news

### Two Major Demands and Seven Proposals Approved by Acting President Li in Reply Telegram

Representatives of more than 30 units of provincial and municipal councils and national vocational groups convened the "National Peace Promotion Association" in this city from the 10th of last month. After three days of discussion, they put forward two major demands and seven proposals related to promoting comprehensive peace, and telegraphed the government and the Chinese Communist Party authorities for adoption. The association received a reply telegram from Acting President Li yesterday, believing that the above suggestions are indeed the goal sought by the government and the people, and have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for reference and adoption. The original telegram is as follows: "To Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the National Chamber of Commerce, and to the Presidium of the National Peace Promotion Association: I have read the Chouchou telegram. Your loyal words and correct arguments are admirable. The two major demands are indeed the key points that those who sincerely seek peace must fulfill, and the seven proposals are also the goals sought by the government and the people. In addition to submitting them to the Executive Yuan for reference and adoption, I specially reply. Li Zongren."

The fastest spread of information attracted so many spectators in a short period of time, even blocking traffic at the North Railway Station for more than 20 minutes, which was unexpected by the police authorities.

### A Series of Questions Worth Considering

In addition to fully investigating the murderer, the railway police authorities have also assigned several detectives and criminology experts to deduce the entire case based on the existing evidence. It is reported that they speculated from the corpse and the yellow army blanket in the box that the deceased may have been a soldier. As for which station the "body in the box" boarded the train, why it had to be transported to Changzhou, whether transporting it to Changzhou was a smokescreen, where the person who transported the "body in the box" to Shanghai is currently hiding, whether he is the murderer, what is the relationship between the women's coat in the corpse box, how to use the "×" on the remaining seal of the corpse box... a series of questions are very thought-provoking and waiting to be answered.

### Rumors of Wang Zongqing's Death Sentence for Inciting Labor Strikes on Two Railways are Unconfirmed

[Our Newspaper Report] It was rumored that Wang Zongqing, Wang Daguang and more than a dozen others who were suspected of inciting labor strikes on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways last time have been arrested and tried by the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters. Wang Zongqing was sentenced to death, and the others were sentenced to imprisonment. It was said that Wang Zongqing had been escorted to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters Military Law Office for scheduled execution. The reporter visited Sun Chongxia, director of the Military Law Office of the Garrison Headquarters, yesterday, who said that he had not heard of this matter so far. The reporter also inquired about the Shanghai Command Post of the Garrison Headquarters, but was unable to confirm it. However, the authorities have always tried to keep the disposal of important prisoners a secret in advance. It is said that Garrison Commander Chen Daqing ordered his subordinates to investigate the source of the news because the above news was published in yesterday's evening newspaper.

### Curfew Shortened, Night Market Reappears Vigorously, Dance Halls and Restaurants Extend Business Hours

[Our Newspaper Report] After the curfew time was shortened by one hour, the nightlife in Shanghai has reappeared vigorously. After learning the news the night before, dance halls, cafes, and tea houses have automatically extended their business hours to 11:00 pm.

Movie theaters have decided to re-schedule all showing times from today, with the last showing extended to start at 9:00 pm. Restaurants and restaurants have also begun to extend business hours last night.

### Strongly Invite Doctors to Make House Calls, Thugs Lurk Outside the Lane: Li Ming's Clinic is in Trouble

[Our Newspaper Report] At around 10:00 yesterday morning, a woman named Yang Yueying, a neighbor of Dr. Li Ming living at No. 25, Lane 672, Changle Road, went to the Jing'an Temple Police Branch to report that: At around 12:00 noon the day before yesterday, two strangers visited Dr. Li seeking medical treatment and insisted on entering. Yang strictly refused them entry because Dr. Li Ming was having a dispute with Zhang Xueqin and feared that there would be an accident. Unexpectedly, at around 9:00 yesterday morning, the people who came the day before yesterday accompanied another man and again invited Dr. Li to make a house call, saying that the patient had a poor appetite and was bedridden. Seeing their fierce appearance, she still refused, saying that Dr. Li had returned to Wuxi. Unexpectedly, they retreated to the back door to wait. It happened that a three-story cohabitant opened the back door without knowing what was going on, and they took the opportunity to rush in and insisted on inviting Dr. Li to make a house call. Mrs. Shu, a neighbor, negotiated with them, but they were unreasonable. When Mrs. Chen stepped forward to hold them, one of the men broke her fingernail and bled. After receiving the report, the Jing'an Temple Branch sent personnel to rush to the scene and take the above two people to the station for interrogation. According to their confession: One named Wu Xin and the other named Yang Laoba were instructed by Zhang Jinlong of the Meili Car Company to invite Dr. Li to make a house call, and they knew nothing else. Later, the police station summoned Zhang Jinlong but failed to do so. More than ten minutes later, the branch received a call from residents of the lane, saying that there were 30 to 40 thugs lurking at the entrance of the lane, intending to do something. Yan, the deputy branch director, and Yu, the section chief, personally led a large number of police officers in police vehicles to rush to the scene to round them up, but they had all dispersed. Section Chief Yu detained the suspects for seven days in accordance with the Violation of Police Law as a warning. According to the previous dispute between Zhang and Li, Zhang was released on bail by the Meili Car Company. Whether there is any other inside story in this case is currently under investigation.

### Forging Bank Drafts: Suspects A and B Apprehended One After Another

[Our Newspaper Report] When the Yu Kang Bank on Nanjing East Road exchanged bills a few days ago, it discovered that a bank draft of the bank with the serial number Shen 350457, with a face value of 2.12 million gold yuan, was forged.

After Ding, the section chief of the section, dispatched Deputy Section Chief Chen Xianrong for investigation, the principal offender Tang Tingde and Wu Yaozhen, who printed the bill, were arrested one after another. According to Tang's confession: he and another friend who is at large conspired in the Deyuan Cooperative.

Then he copied the handwriting of the person who issued the bank's draft and wrote a forged bill of the above amount. He entrusted Wu Fan Huifang, who lived at No. 18, Lane 542, Fengyang Road, to cash it out, and then it was exchanged after several turns on the evening of the same day before it was discovered by Yu Kang Bank. The case was fully investigated yesterday. The police bureau transferred Tang and Wu to the Prosecutor's Office on suspicion of forging valuable securities for interrogation.

### Garrison Forcibly Purchases Fuel: Police Department Agrees to Stop It

[Our Newspaper Report] The city government previously approved a public letter from the City Council, in which 12 retail stores, including Guangda Coal Store, reported that soldiers under the 202nd Division of the Youth Army stationed in this city forcibly purchased fuel from the store. The city government requested prompt handling of the case, and the city government sent a letter to the Garrison Headquarters to investigate and stop it. It is reported that Chen Daqing, commander of the Songhu Garrison, recently sent a telegram saying: "The headquarters has repeatedly ordered the troops and soldiers not to forcibly purchase goods. If there is any further forced purchase, it will be reported to the military police for detention and legal action. I hereby reply for verification." The city government has replied to the City Council for verification.

### The Atmosphere at Jiaotong University is Lively with Firecrackers and Drums; Student Union Election Competition is Intense

[Special Report] The campus of Jiaotong University in Xujiahui has been immersed in a fierce election atmosphere these past few days, all for the seventh student union election since the restoration. This semester, the election method has changed from individual candidates to class-based competition. Ten classes are to be selected from the 83 classes in the entire university to carry out the work of the various departments of the student union. As a result, enthusiastic election campaigns have unfolded among the various classes. Upon entering the school gate, everywhere from classrooms to dining halls to dormitories, one can see propaganda slogans of all sizes and colors plastered on the walls. Large election banners hang from the trees along the walkways, campaign manifestos are broadcast over the loudspeakers, and even the ground is covered with artistic election lettering. The campaign methods of each class are varied and unique. In addition to the common set of tactics, there are even entertaining programs such as showing movies and enjoying record music. The sources of campaign funds for each class also vary, ranging from voluntary donations from students, contributions from department associations, or equal sharing among the students of the class, with the first two methods being the most common.

Yesterday at 12:30 noon, all the classes jointly held a large election parade on campus. Everyone was scheming and showing off their abilities. The procession included foreign music bands, large gongs and drums, decorated cars, costumed performances, and various propaganda banners and slogans. The bright banner of Jiaotong University led the procession of five or six hundred people through all parts of the campus. The sounds of gongs and drums, firecrackers, songs, dances, and slogans intertwined to create a lively scene, as each class asked students to vote for them. Professors, police, and students crowded along both sides of the walkways, and as the procession passed, bursts of laughter, cheers, and applause erupted. The students had obtained permission from the university for a full public holiday for the first class in the afternoon for the election parade. At 6 p.m. in the evening, an election evening party was held at the school gymnasium, where each class gave a brief election speech and performed specially choreographed election songs and dances.

The propaganda slogan of the sophomore class of the Department of Hydraulic Engineering said, "Hydraulic Engineering II are oxen, not scalpers." And their election slogans included, "Scowling coldly at corrupt officials, we hate their lies during elections. Willing to be oxen for our classmates, we pledge to be loyal and consistent after being elected." and "The north wind kills early, jackals quickly die and get out, stop lingering and misleading the people. Spring is gradually thickening, water buffaloes diligently plow and plant, all hard work is for the masses." The meanings are all very profound.

The election propaganda of the past few days has already drawn the atmosphere inside Jiaotong University into a heated state. Today, ballot papers are distributed, and voting begins. Eighty ballot boxes have been set up throughout the university. Which ten classes will be victorious will be known when the ballots are counted next Monday.

### Investigation by the Supervisory Committee on the Matter of Top Housing by Directors of the China Textile Company Completed; Liu Weichi's Use of Public Funds Was "Public Funds for Public Purposes" and There Was No Responsibility

[Special Report] After an investigation by the Supervisory Committee Branch Office for the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Region regarding the matter of top housing by the newly appointed directors of China Textile Company, such as Deng Gongxuan, the responsibilities have been largely determined. According to the investigation, Chen Qitian, the former executive director of China Textile Company, still occupies the China Textile Company's director's guest house, and all of Chen's belongings are supplied by the company. His wife even stated to the outside world that Chen needed to stay there for recuperation due to illness, but it is true that Chen's occupation of the premises led to the top housing of the new directors. Secondly, the process of Director Sun Jiuku's top housing was entirely handled by the company, and Sun went to live there. Since Sun's wife personally went to the top housing and did not handle any funds, Sun has no responsibility. It is said that the process of Deng's top housing was not handled personally either, while Secretary Guo Ying personally received the funds and handled the matter herself, which is obviously inappropriate. However, Liu Weichi was not involved in this matter. The investigation by the Supervisory Committee Branch Office is complete, and the report will be released soon. Secondly, regarding the matter of Liu Weichi's use of 18 million yuan of public funds, the investigation by the Branch Office concluded that it was "public funds for public purposes" and that the funds had been returned in a short period of time, so Liu himself bears no responsibility.

### Research Institutes of Academia Sinica in Beijing and Shanghai Temporarily Not Considering Relocation to Taiwan; Facing Financial Difficulties and Eagerly Hoping for Solutions

[Special Report] The National Academia Sinica has thirteen research institutes, including History and Language, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Geology, Zoology, Botany, Chemistry, Psychology, Medicine, Engineering, Astronomy, Meteorology, and Physics. Currently, except for the History and Language and Mathematics Institutes, which have been moved to Taiwan, and the Social Sciences and Geology Institutes, which remain in Beijing, the remaining nine institutes are all concentrated in Shanghai. Previously, when the situation was tense, the authorities planned to move all the research institutes in Beijing and Shanghai to Taiwan. The researchers in the institutes felt that a long-distance relocation would cause damage to equipment, dispersal of personnel, and cessation of work, so most did not agree. Now that the situation has temporarily stabilized, the talk of relocation has ceased.

Like other government academic institutions and schools, the most serious problem for Academia Sinica is funding. The Legislative Yuan has not yet approved this year's budget. Apart from public expenses, the Ministry of Education has only allocated funds to each institute twice so far this year. The first time was 5,000 yuan per institute, and the second time was 50,000 yuan. This amount of funding is far from the actual expenses, so most institutes rely on overdrafts to maintain operations. Recently, the Ministry of Education sent a telegram from Guangzhou stating that a total of 5 million yuan could be remitted to the research institutes in Beijing, Shanghai, and Taiwan, but the public expenses budget for the Shanghai institutes alone, including water, electricity, gas, and telephone, requires 8 million yuan for March alone. Previously, the personnel in Shanghai had resolved to send representatives to Beijing to petition for increased funding. Later, because President Zhu Jiahua returned to Shanghai from Guangzhou, he went to Beijing to discuss solutions with relevant parties.

The Academia Sinica currently has over a hundred researchers and associate researchers. Their salaries are calculated according to a standard of 75 times, averaging about 15,000 yuan per month, excluding board and lodging within the institute. Under these difficult circumstances, they still do not give up the research work they have been immersed in for many years, hoping to achieve something. In terms of research equipment, there is still a shortage of equipment. In previous years, foreign exchange was requested to order and replenish equipment from abroad, but there has been no foreign exchange in the past year.

### Scholarships for Poor Students Expected to Reach 40 Million

[Special Report] The scholarship fund for poor students in this city, after the Bureau of Education requested radio stations and the entertainment industry to raise funds through the airwaves, has raised more than 14 million yuan. However, half of this amount has not yet been received. The Bureau of Education is urging the Boy Scouts to actively collect the funds, with a deadline of the 5th to collect all of them. Other items donated by various sectors of society will be sold at a charity sale, which is expected to raise more than 5 million yuan. Mayor Wu has promised to donate 10 million yuan in the name of the municipal government, and Mayor Wu and Director Li will also solicit 10 million yuan from the National Bank, bringing the total amount to 40 million yuan. This scholarship fund will be distributed according to the student enrollment ratios reported by each school.

### Stranded Students in Yantai are Ill and Urgently Awaiting Relief

[Special Report] The Shandong Qingdao stranded students who previously came to Shanghai and stayed at the Shandong Provincial Association on Zizhong Road in this city, including more than 200 students from Jinan United Middle School and more than 70 students from Qingdao Middle School, have recently left Shanghai in batches and have all departed as of yesterday. It is reported that the Jinan students went to Hangzhou and then to Jiangxi, and the Qingdao students went to Changsha and Hengyang in Hunan. Currently, there are still 20 students from Yantai Guohua Middle School, including Qiu Shuji, and two students from Yiwen Middle School, including Zhang Jiuke, recuperating in the Shandong Provincial Association. According to Qiu, Zhang, and others, more than 2,000 students from eight middle schools in Yantai fled to Shanghai in November of last year. Later, they all went to Lantian in Hunan, where they established the main school and the first branch of the United Middle School in Lantian, and the second and third branches in Qiaotou City and Sanjia, a few miles away from Lantian. Qiu and the other 22 students suffered from acclimatization, diarrhea, fever, blisters on their bodies, and weak limbs, so they had no choice but to return to Shanghai in December of last year. Currently, seven of them are still ill and have not recovered. Because they have nowhere to seek help, in addition to pawning their clothes and belongings, they can only eat a subsidized bowl of congee at the Pulv Society on Changle Road in this city every day, and there is no other way. Their situation is very pitiful, and it is hoped that the authorities in charge of youth guidance and relief in the Ministry of Education will find a way to provide them with relief.

### More Than Half of the Students at Shanghai Textile College are Receiving Reduced or Waived Tuition; President Zhou Raises Funds Everywhere to Support

The Private Shanghai Textile Industrial College has dedicated professors and excellent results. Most of the graduates of each class are introduced to jobs by the school. Although the school is in a very difficult situation, it did not increase tuition fees last semester, and senior students continued to attend classes during the winter vacation. Although tuition and miscellaneous fees this semester are calculated based on the price of rice, the price per stone is only 4,100 yuan. Students receiving reduced or waived tuition account for 70% of the entire school, so the tuition fees collected in one semester are far from sufficient to cover expenses. President Zhou Chengyou raises funds from textile factories to make up for the shortfall.

### Yuyou Volunteer School Established

The Yuyou Volunteer Tutoring School, sponsored by the Yuyou Friendship Association of the St. John's Alumni Association, has been established. The school is purely voluntary and everything is free. Registration is open from today until 8 p.m. on the 9th. Workers and other out-of-school youth aged 17 or above, with a primary school to middle school level of education, can bring two small half-length photos to No. 94 Haige Road (near Jing'an Temple Road) to register.

Officer Song led police officers Xu Zichang, Song Shaoke, Li Yuran, and Weng Hui to rush there, and they successfully captured the suspect. They then escorted him to his home at No. 375 Songjiazhai on Guangfu West Road, where they found a pistol and five bullets. Xu also confessed that his accomplice, Xia Qifu, was hiding at No. 370 Siming Village on Hongqiao Road. The investigating police officers escorted Xu to identify Xia, and Xia was also arrested and brought back to the police station. According to his confession, he had committed several theft cases.

### Authorities Step Up Spring Epidemic Prevention Work

[Special Report] According to sources from the Bureau of Health: The Ministry of Health has designated Shanghai as an epidemic prevention demonstration zone to strengthen immunization vaccinations for newborn infants, child refugees, and children under school age. The city's spring epidemic prevention work has been actively launched by the Municipal Bureau of Health and will be stepped up starting this month. In addition, adults who were vaccinated more than three years ago must also undergo immunization vaccinations to prevent transmission.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Sends Ships to Continue Searching for Floating Corpses from the Jiangya

[Special Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is still continuing to salvage the bodies of the victims of the Jiangya ferry disaster. The Huazi No. 208 landing craft was dispatched again, carrying representatives from various hometown associations and 30 empty coffins. Yesterday morning, they left port to search for floating corpses in the waters off eastern Zhejiang, and sailed to Huanglong and Sijiao to investigate. The coffins were brought to be used to collect and bury the bodies whenever they are found.

### Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs States that the Cost-of-Living Index Wage System Remains Unchanged; Industries Related to People's Livelihood Will Still Be Regulated; Hairdressing Prices Will Use the Cost-of-Living Index Calculation

[Special Report] Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Cao Peizi, the director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, to inquire about the possibility of employees demanding that their salaries be calculated in customs gold units, following the recent decision by public utilities to calculate prices in customs gold units. According to Cao, the cost-of-living index wage system is very scientific, and before a more perfect method is found, any request for change will not be considered. When asked about rumors of loans from the National Bank to support private factories, Cao said that there were many difficulties with this matter and it had not yet been considered. As far as he knows, there will be no problems with raw materials for each factory in March. The requests from the owners of small factories to stop work have been rejected. As for the recent rise in prices, those closely related to the public's livelihood will still be regulated. For example, the recent price increase in the hairdressing industry is too high and unreasonable. The prices have been divided into several levels based on pre-war prices, with each level having a base number, which is multiplied by the monthly published cost-of-living index to arrive at the new hairdressing price. This method has been submitted to the municipal government for review, and if it is approved at the municipal meeting, industries such as bathhouses and hotels may follow this principle.

### The Scalpers are Growing in Strength, Their Livelihood is Both Bitter and Sweet; The Foundation of Their Transactions is Built on the Vast Salaried Class

[Special Report] In recent years, there has been a noteworthy phenomenon in Shanghai: the increasing strength of silver dollar scalpers. In the gaps between the ever-changing economic policies of the authorities, this group, known as "silver dollar scalpers," has expanded from their base in the Old North Gate to Henan Road, Xinghualou, the racecourse, Jing'an Temple, Xujiahui, Tongfu Road, and Avenue Joffre, almost distributing themselves throughout all the important areas of Shanghai. The silver dollar, which had been absent for fourteen years, has unexpectedly made a comeback, and the rise and fall of the value of the gold yuan tells every citizen directly and deeply through the "silver dollar scalpers."

Although the ranks of the "silver dollar scalpers" are growing, their initial appearance was extremely accidental. Long before the decisive battle in the Yellow River flooded area in the Central Plains, the Communist-controlled areas, in order to fully absorb materials from the government-controlled areas, encouraged the people to enter and exit Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Hunan in "single-gang" style, purchasing in small quantities. Because they stipulated a relatively high discount on silver dollars, silver dollars became one of the purchasing targets. At that time, the areas near Wuhan, Sanxiang, Bangbu, and Wu, which were close to the war zone, saw silver dollars being absorbed in large quantities at high prices. How could Shanghai speculators not know? They immediately gathered floating capital, secretly established shops, and contacted areas up the Yangtze River. Under their coordination and call, a small number of "silver dollar scalpers" began to appear in the Old North Gate area. However, their initial appearance was inevitably masked, and the transactions were not very lively.

Open-Air Markets Distributed in Various Districts

It wasn't until the price controls were lifted on August 19 of last year that black market prices for silver dollars soared in Hunan and Hubei. At this time, the flames of war were raging everywhere, and the actual transactions between the Communist and Nationalist areas decreased, but the transactions between Shanghai and Hankou increased. The Hankou gang, Changsha gang, Subei gang, Anhui gang, and countless "single-gangs" all came to Shanghai to seek silver dollars. Therefore, the "silver dollar scalpers'" open-air markets opened for business, occupying land on various roads, and gradually taking shape.

In just over a month, the golden age for the "silver dollar scalpers," which emphasized light profits, quickly disappeared. Provinces and cities in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River began to exert political pressure, causing silver dollar black market prices to plummet. The number of out-of-town customers decreased. The "silver dollar scalpers'" business scope had to shrink to simply maintaining the difference between buying and selling. But what is puzzling is that the number of people "employed" by them has been increasing. Their targets naturally cannot be limited to two types of people: those who intend to save, or those who are waiting for urgent use. Because the buying and selling procedures are convenient, and the amount is not as large as gold, especially because its transaction foundation can be built on the vast salaried class, shop employees, and even rickshaw pullers, maids, etc., it is quite able to maintain a "prosperous livelihood" situation. When business is busiest, the exchange of silver and banknotes is done under the sleeves, without even taking the time to carefully examine "clipped coins" or "dull coins."

External Disturbances Occur Frequently

Having broken away from the support of speculators and going to "fight alone," the "silver dollar scalpers" can be said to have both bitter and sweet experiences in business. External disturbances and police raids can occur at any time. Once, a "silver dollar scalper" received a customer who looked like a soldier, wanting to sell. The price was settled, and the "silver dollar scalper" was counting the banknotes one stack at a time. While counting, the "customer" suddenly disappeared. The "silver dollar scalper" quickly grabbed a uniformed officer from the crowd and asked, "Officer, where's the money?" This "officer" was not easy to mess with. He rolled his eyes and said in a Shanghai accent, "What money?" But usually, things are relatively calm because the connections between them form a price, so there is no need to pay special attention to the influence of the situation or have a clear understanding. Of course, they are not absolutely loyal to the market or customers. Once, a "silver dollar scalper" raised the selling price by two grades. After a customer bought three silver dollars and discovered that he had been cheated, he went to argue. The "silver dollar scalper" simply ignored him. As a result, the customer had no choice but to complain to the police. Who knew that the police officer would answer irrelevantly and ask him a question: "Do you know what this scalper's surname is?"

Specialize in Buying Miscellaneous Silver Dollars at Low Prices

Why is it that the transaction price of silver dollars has always been led by the "Yuan Head" and has remained strong for so long? The "silver dollar scalpers" themselves do not know the reason. In theory, the silver content of the "Yuan Head" is only 90%, so the price should not be higher than the "Eagle Dollar" and "Dragon Dollar," which have silver contents of 92% to 95%. In rural areas around Jiangnan, it has recently been informally stipulated that eight silver dollars can be exchanged for one stone of rice, and the silver dollar must be the "Eagle Dollar." This is because they traditionally believe in the fineness of the "Eagle Dollar." Shanghai rice merchants who go to Songjiang and Jiaxing to purchase rice have also searched for "Eagle Dollars" on the market at one time. However, the price of the "Eagle Dollar" has never exceeded the "Yuan Head." According to the "silver dollar scalpers," some people specialize in buying miscellaneous silver dollars such as the "Small Head," "Sichuan Dollar," and "Hong Kong Silver Dollar" at low prices, because they have illusions that silver dollars will be used at the same price after the announcement of the financial reform plan.

### Spring River Waters Warm, Talking About "Crossing the River"

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Li Tian

[Dispatch from Yongkou by this Newspaper, 1st] Based on intelligence obtained by the military from various sources, and reports I have come into contact with from people of all walks of life in Jiangbei, regarding the recent situation in Jiangbei after "liberation," the following conclusion can be summarized: Although south of the Yangtze River, especially in the Nanjing-Shanghai area, the sound of peace talks is deafening, here, neither the sound of peace can be heard, nor can any atmosphere of peace be seen. What is heard and seen here is only "speedily and vigorously completing all preparations for crossing the river," "fighting to Nanjing, capturing alive ×××," and "responding to the call of superiors and carrying out the revolution to the end."

Originally From Yongcheng Eastward

Since the end of the Qinglongji battle, after the Nationalist army's Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi corps, following Huang Baitao, Huang Wei, and Sun Yuanliang's three corps, were "eaten," Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng have, in the past fifty days, reportedly completed their replenishment at an astonishing speed. Among these, excluding Liu Bocheng's main force which had already been transferred back to Dabie Mountain and the Central Plains Military Region, Chen Yi's troops, which had only fifteen field army columns during the Jinan campaign in September of last year, have, in the past five months, not only replenished their original losses, but have also expanded to twenty-five columns, totaling more than 500,000 men. Of these twenty-five columns, except for eight columns stationed in Shandong and the Xuhai area of northern Jiangsu, the remaining seventeen columns are all stationed between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, including three columns, the 10th, 11th, and 12th, along the Grand Canal line in northern Jiangsu between Huaiyin and Yangzhou; the Yangtze River Column in the Nantong-Jingjiang area; five columns, the 2nd, 3rd, 9th, Bohai, and Rapid columns, on both sides of the Tianyang Highway in the Tianchang and southwest Gaoyou Lake area; four columns, the 1st, 4th, New 8th, and Liangguang, in the Mingguang-Chuxian-Quanjiao area of the southern section of the Jinpu Railway; three columns, the 6th, New 5th, and New 6th, and the 37th Army, reorganized from Wu Huawen's unit which "took righteousness" in Jinan, in Hefei and its vicinity on the Huainan Railway; the 7th Column and the 35th Army near Chaoxian; and another 25,000 men with numbers yet to be investigated stationed in the Kongjiaqiao and Sima Town area near the port. The total strength of the above seventeen columns, two armies, plus the local Communists, should be more than 400,000 men. Their command system is as follows: in the area of the Grand Canal and its surrounding regions, it is the responsibility of Chen Yi's deputy Su Yu; in the area of the southern section of Jinpu and its surrounding regions, it is the responsibility of Xu Shiyou, commander of the Shandong Corps of the East China Field Army, with Chen Yi overseeing the whole.

In the past week, the main force of the Communist army on the Grand Canal line has all gathered in the Yangzhou, Xiannvmiao, Yiling, and Simaqiao area. The Communist army near Tianchang has also moved towards the Tianyang Highway and Liuhe. The Communist army on the Jinpu front has also been transferred south one after another. According to the military's judgment, the Communist army seems to be attempting to occupy the Jiangbei bridgehead positions of the Nationalist army with an absolute superiority in forces, attempting to invade Bawu south of Jingjiang, Kou'an south of Taixian, Shijiaqiao, Shierwu, Liuwu, Guazhou, Yizheng, and the Dahekou southwest of Yangzhou, Liangpu area south of the Hehe River, Jiangpu, Niaojiang, and Yuxikou of the southern section of Jinpu. (The Anqing and western bridgehead positions are not included.)

Is the Communist army's attack on the Jiangbei bridgehead positions of the Nationalist army a

full-scale offensive? Or is it a series of individual attacks? In the near future, the Communist army will answer us with facts. But one point that can be pointed out here is that capturing the Jiangbei bridgehead is an important item in the "preparations for crossing the river." Therefore, before the Communist army launches the offensive to cross the river, it must first occupy the entire, or at least the majority, of the Jiangbei bridgehead positions of the Nationalist army, because these bridgehead positions are also the connecting points of important rivers and the Yangtze River, or at least they are ports on the north bank of the Yangtze River that can accommodate larger ships. If the Communist army does not occupy these important ports in advance, the large number of warships it has built in the Grand Canal, Hongze, Gaoyou, Yingtong, and various lakes will have no appropriate outlet. If these many bridgehead positions are not occupied, its coastal highway will not be able to be built smoothly. If the coastal highway cannot be completed, it will be a major difficulty for the movement of its troops, especially the deployment of heavy artillery units, because its heavy weapons cannot be used flexibly to cover its river-crossing troops and inflict effective damage on the Nationalist navy. Therefore, we may as well explain in more detail here that the Communist army's preparations for crossing the river, in addition to the necessary capture of most of the Jiangbei bridgehead positions of the Nationalist army, should include: (1) completing the coastal highway, or even two or more highways, both parallel and inner and outer lines; (2) completing the Jinpu Railway: At present, the Jinpu Railway is still operating in sections. The Nationalist army removed two sections of the Luokou Yellow River Railway Bridge north of Jinan last autumn, and the materials are still stored in Jinan. The Communist army is planning to repair it. The railway south of Xuzhou only reaches Guzhen. The large railway bridge over the Huai River north of Bengbu is being actively repaired after being destroyed. In addition, three or four smaller bridges south of Bengbu are also under construction. If the railway is not repaired, the large number of Japanese, American, and German heavy weapons captured by the Communist army in the Northeast will not be able to be transported to the Jiangbei coast; (3) building a large number of ferries: It is reported that Chen Yi plans to build 10,000 various types of ferries, of which, in addition to a few rubber boats with motors and civilian ships that were captured on various battlefields, most need to be built temporarily; (4) water warfare training: The past "human wave tactics" are truly "useless for heroes" on the water! Everything from swimming, steering, rowing, how to "land in front of the enemy"? How to occupy "beachhead positions" are all new topics and all need to be learned from scratch.

Although Ye Jianying is "bragging" to the Nanjing

peace delegation, saying that "the Communist army can cross the river at any time"; although Chen Yi also claims that "wasn't it me who led troops across the river after the "Southern Anhui Incident" during the Anti-Japanese War? At that time, the Japanese navy and air force were better than today's Nationalist army, and now the strength of the Communist army is incomparable to that of the "Southern Anhui Incident"?" But before these many military and technical problems are properly resolved, such as small-scale, piecemeal sneak crossings, to enhance the strength of the local Communists in Jiangnan, so that they can accumulate little by little when necessary, and preemptively occupy some Jiangnan bridgehead, and then respond to and welcome the main force of the Jiangbei Communist army crossing the river, of course, it is possible. But if you want to talk about "crossing the river in a big way" at the moment, it is naturally "too early to say." Moreover, all levels of cadres in the Chinese Communist Party unanimously believe that the Bible, that is, Mao Zedong's book "The Current Situation and Our Tasks," repeatedly tells them, "Do not fight unprepared battles, do not fight battles that are not sure of victory!" Chen Yi and his subordinates will certainly not act rashly before completing sufficient preparations. Therefore, the conclusion here is: it is very likely that the Communist army will launch an attack to capture the Jiangbei bridgehead positions of the Nationalist army within this month. If we talk about the main force crossing the river, it will definitely have to wait until April or May of this year, after the spring river waters have warmed and the preparations for crossing the river have been completed. At that time, the "peace talk" game should naturally have yielded results. If the Chinese Communist Party believes that the "conditions are satisfactory," it may as well implement "political crossing of the river" first. Otherwise, if it believes that it is "not satisfactory enough," what follows is naturally another main force decisive battle launched by Liu Bocheng, Lin Biao (recently reported: one column of Lin Biao's troops has already gone south along the Pinghan Railway and crossed the Yellow River), Chen Geng, etc. towards Central China, and coordinated with this offensive of the Communist army, Chen Yi's troops will, under the response of the local Communists in Jiangnan, launch a large-scale crossing of the river at several points!

### Illegal Soldiers Executed in Changshu

[Dispatch from this newspaper] Two illegal soldiers in Changshu, Dai Jishan and Wu Youcai, were arrested by the city defense headquarters, sentenced to death, and handed over to their original units for execution by firing squad.

### Strict Discipline of Soldiers in Chongming: Soap in Exchange for Stamps, Postal Workers Show Sympathy and Prefer to Give It Away

[Dispatch from Chongming, 10th of this newspaper] According to reliable sources: Commander-in-Chief Gui is preparing to make Chongming one of the naval bases. After Xiao's troops are set up, it will be gradually implemented. There is a saying passed down among the people of Chongming: "When the world is in chaos, Chongming is a good place to hide from disaster!" The current situation is very different. Unless peace is achieved, I am afraid it will be difficult to do so.

The discipline of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army stationed in Chongming is strict and they do not commit the slightest offense. Their treatment is extremely low, but they are content with it and never overstep the bounds due to poverty. Once, a reporter met a soldier at a stamp agency to mail a letter. He did not have any money with him, so he took out a cake of government-issued soap that had just been used to pay for the postage. When the agency saw this, they expressed great sympathy and were willing to give it away, returning the soap to him. He was so grateful that tears streamed down his face, and he thanked them repeatedly. Two or three days later, he returned the postage perfectly. From this, we can see how strict their discipline is.

### A Small Episode in Soliciting Scholarship Funds: Donations End on Schedule, Readers Insist on Donating Funds

According to the scheduled plan, this newspaper's "Reader Scholarship Fund" will stop soliciting donations at the end of February, process the review procedures as soon as possible, and issue the aid funds in advance to avoid losses to the applying students due to price fluctuations. Yesterday, a kind-hearted reader, in the name of Zhide Tang, came to the office to donate 100,000 yuan. We told him that we could no longer accept it because the fundraising had ended. However, this reader was determined and very enthusiastic, so we had to accept it sincerely.

There was also a reader named Wang Cunjie who transferred the 5,000 yuan of scholarship funds he had applied for from the school to the Reader Scholarship Fund due to improved economic conditions. Of course, we had no reason to disappoint him, so we had to accept it as well.

### Two Monks in Yixing Died Miserably and Strangely: Clues to the Murderer Have Been Found

[Dispatch from Yixing, 28th of this newspaper] Futian Nunnery in Fangzhuang Township, Xushe District, under the jurisdiction of the county, is isolated on the bank of a bridge east of the village, about half a mile from the village. It has only twelve mu of temple land, which is enough to support the life of one monk, presided over by the monk Yuekun. Yuekun discussed with the local area to help repair the temple, which had been in disrepair for many years. Construction began last spring and it returned to its former appearance. Zen Buddhist monk Jing, the director of the Buddhist Association of Jiangsu Province, recently came to Yixing from Zhenjiang and stayed at the nunnery. Yuekun treated him like a guest, regarding it as a glory for Buddhism. At 9:00 a.m. on February 25, a daughter-in-law of Li Haofa from Xibutou village in the village went to burn incense. The mountain gate was ajar, so she pushed it open and entered. She called for the monk but could not find him, so she lit the fire herself. After finishing the worship, she glimpsed a hole dug in the east wall of the nunnery. When villagers such as Li Xingjiu heard the news, they became curious and asked a companion to enter the nunnery to investigate. Soon they went straight into Yuekun's bedroom and approached the cloud bed. They suddenly saw Yuekun dead in a pool of blood. They took a fire and saw two knife wounds on his head, which were chopped by a kitchen knife. Li Xingjiu and others immediately left the nunnery and walked to the riverbank in front of the nunnery. They saw the body of the monk Jingchan thrown in the river, with injuries all over his body, apparently caused by wooden sticks. As for the cause of death of the two monks, everyone had different opinions for a while. According to the clue of the murderer, it has been found from the hemp rope with which the monk Jingguan was tied, and it is now being hunted down.

### Bird's-Eye View of Zhumadian

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Fang Canglang

[Dispatch from Xinyang, 26th of this newspaper] Six hours before the special car of the press corps moved north (3:00 a.m.), Pengjiawan Station, 13 kilometers away from Xinyang, was suddenly looted by more than 20 bandits. Even the shoes on the stationmaster's feet were snatched away. When the news came, the atmosphere at Xinyang Station was particularly tense, but our "Paire" was not discouraged at all. After waiting for the report from the armored car on its patrol, it finally departed on time. Commander Li Benyi, out of concern for the safety of the reporters, specifically instructed the assault troops escorting the car to set up machine guns behind the two motorcycles at the front and rear of the car. Fu Guang, the deputy chief of staff of the military headquarters who accompanied the group, also held an American submachine gun and jumped into the car.

The Central Plains Is in Turmoil, Bandits Rise

Leaving Xinyang and heading north, we are heading into another realm. The impression on both sides of the railway is a picture intertwined with the scenery of desolation, desolation, eeriness, and tension. From the Huaihe Bridge, Changtaiguan, Minggang, Queshan, to Zhumadian, on both sides of the railway belonging to Xinyang and Queshan counties, we only saw three thin plows, more than ten villages burned by starvation, many new graves, and the suffering people who boiled wild grass and black noodles into a pot of soup, which looked like coriander was added to oxtail soup, and they ate it with relish. It is extremely lucky to eat a little black noodles. Otherwise, you have to become a robber and steal to eat. In the eleven years of war, on the land south of the Great River, according to official estimates, it is impossible to estimate how many of the 32.84 million people have been killed and starved to death. At least 30,000 to 40,000 people are still starving to death. Now, the Central Plains is in turmoil and bandits are rising. Who should be held responsible for this? Those who have died and are waiting to die obviously have not figured it out yet. So, the strong take the risk, and the weaker ones take the opportunity to imitate the early practices of the local Communists, holding guns and dominating a village, making pitiful eyes at both sides, and waiting to see what happens. This phenomenon is really no different from a new "copy" of the turbulent era of the Yellow Turban Rebellion in the Han Dynasty.

Yun Chang Is Stationed, the County Magistrate Bears the Burden

The light car, in the posture of a knight, crossed the Huaihe Bridge and swept past Minggang, as fast as a galloping horse. The carriage swayed like a cradle, but none of us complained of dizziness. When the car stopped at Queshan, Tu Jingtang, the current brigade commander of the 3rd Security Brigade and the magistrate of Queshan, who came from a middle school principal and led students to fight guerrillas, from southern Henan and northern Huai to northern Jiangsu, and has never been defeated, also jumped into the car and accompanied us north. Among the local armed forces, this brigade is Zhang Zhen's trump card, because the combat power and discipline of Tu's troops are all satisfactory, so they are placed on the front line of the Pinghan Front and bear the important task of defending Queshan and Zhumadian. Now that Zhang's corps has added strong troops to defend here, it shows that Zhumadian, where Guan Yunchang was once stationed, is even stronger and more solid. The car passed Queshan and arrived at Zhumadian, the forefront of southern Henan, in 40 minutes. The platform was already full of representatives from all walks of life welcoming the press corps. After we got out of the car and greeted Deputy Brigade Commander Sun, Regiment Commander Lai of the garrison, and the local gentry, we were invited to walk to the Catholic Church to rest. Along the way, we saw a post every five steps and a sentry every ten steps. Moreover, every cross street and intersection was guarded by sentries. The thoroughness of the protection and the severity of the atmosphere were unprecedented.

Dangerous Zone, Cold Guns Fired

According to Deputy Brigade Commander Sun, Zhumadian Tuzhai is about ten li in circumference, and the population inside the stockade is about 50,000. About 20,000 passengers pass through it every day. There are as many as 50 large and small institutions, and there are two administrative inspectors' offices and 19 exiled county governments, including Suiping, Runan, and Biyang. In addition to the garrison and local teams of various counties, the total number is actually 100,000. This Muir town is only seven li away from the front-line trenches at the closest point. When we arrived, the trenches not far from the railway station on both sides of the railway were already full of combat soldiers wearing steel helmets. They had to guard against attacks at all times and also had to constantly guard against the at least hundreds of plainclothes local Communists lurking in the stockade. The task was very arduous, so they specifically divided the entire stockade into five alert zones. The area from the station to Changshou Street at the Catholic Church was the most dangerous zone. Cold guns were fired from time to time. The complicated situation was far more than Jieshou during the Anti-Japanese War.

Second Day Town, Mobile Market

We rested for a while at Tiansheng Hall. At the reception, after listening to Deputy Brigade Commander Sun and President Wang of the Chamber of Commerce report on the local situation, we took advantage of the group meal to freely interview and visit the city within and outside the stockade. This is the second largest town in southern Henan on the Pinghan Line, 56 kilometers away from Luohe, the largest town, only 45 li north of Suiping County, 70 li east of Zhengyang, about 110 li southwest of Biyang, 45 li south of Queshan, 65 li southeast of Runan, 100 li northeast of Shangcha, and 140 li northwest of Wuyang. It is the lowest basin in southern Henan. During the rainy season, the water inside the stockade can be knee-deep. There are no rivers. Residents use well water, but the sewers on both sides of the street are very well made and the city is quite clean. The vendors all over the street illustrate the mobility of this market. The stationmaster of the railway often works on the train. It has become a habit for the locomotive to turn around immediately after arriving at the station. Commerce is dominated by miscellaneous grains, cotton, yarn, cloth, tobacco, paper, sugar, salt, oil, and pork.

Between Luo and Zhu, the Number of Business Vehicles Decreased Sharply

Now that the Communist army is pressing in, there is not much tobacco and cotton coming from the north and paper and cloth coming from the south. The number of business vehicles traveling between Luo and Zhu has also decreased from more than 100 per day to 20 or 30. The unified collection office, which includes twelve kinds of donations and taxes, has greatly reduced its tax revenue. Information personnel and counterintelligence activities from both sides, who are active in various forms on this candle head, have never stopped. The guys who make a fortune by smuggling contraband have come and gone again. It is really an adventurer's paradise. Material exchange stations and information exchanges are only miserable for the local poor who are struggling to survive under the scarcity of food and firewood. They are almost awakened every night by the hateful gunshots.

### After Free Trading of Gold and Silver Is Restored, National Banks Are Able to Stabilize the Market: Finance Minister Xu Said at the Reception for Reporters That National Banks Have a Set of Measures to Stabilize the Market

[Dispatch from this newspaper] Finance Minister Xu Kan and National Bank President Liu Gongyun emphasized at the press conference yesterday that the government must have the power to stabilize the current volatile market. Liu said: National banks have many ways to tighten credit. After the new plan is announced this time, the tools for National banks to sell have increased to five types: cotton yarn, sugar, state-owned enterprise stocks, foreign exchange transfer certificates, and gold and silver. National banks will sell any kind of materials at any time depending on actual needs. The purpose of selling is to absorb gold yuan, not to suppress prices. Although the number of issuances is kept confidential, according to the current U.S. dollar exchange rate, less than 20 million U.S. dollars can recover all the gold yuan that have been issued. As for how to stabilize various markets, National banks now has a set of measures under discussion. Xu also repeatedly stated that after free trading of gold and silver is restored, National banks will definitely have the power to stabilize the market. If National banks had not successively sold materials in the past few months, I am afraid that the market prices of various commodities would be more than they are today.

(Another dispatch) After Finance Minister Xu Kan flew to this city, he immediately met with Central Bank President Liu Gongyun and Bureau Director Lin Chongyong at the Bank of China that night to review the financial and price situation in this city after the announcement of the new financial plan. Yesterday afternoon, Xu held a banquet at the Bank of China to entertain leaders from the financial and industrial and commercial circles in this city, during which he explained the content of the new financial plan and reviewed the price fluctuations in this city in recent days. It is said that Xu also appealed to all parties to assist in the implementation of the new financial plan.

### Commodity Prices Are Rising Again, and Gold Notes Are in Good Demand

On the second day of the issuance of large banknotes, commodity prices rose again. Because funds from various places came again, the tight credit situation eased slightly, and the secret interest rate was 70 to 75 yuan. After public utilities were valued in Guan Yuan, the rise was alarming. Tax collection was changed to the payment of real objects, and production costs doubled. Gold notes outside the market were in good demand. Gold (9) unit price (thousand yuan)

Yesterday, the afternoon closing price of gold notes was 20% higher than the morning, and all transactions were for overnight settlements. However, due to excessively high asking prices, there was much speculation, and trading was not smooth.

The Central Bank still released them, as low as 2,850 yuan, and then raised them to 2,960 yuan. At noon, it was seen to return to a small amount, between 2,880 yuan and 930 yuan at noon, it is said.

### A Positive Outlook Across the Board Boosts the Shanghai Stock Market

The trend in Chinese stocks is one of comprehensive strength, with the market showing a momentum of direct upward movement. This is largely due to the reform of public utility prices, which are now calculated on a basic unit of currency, boosting confidence within the industry and creating extreme enthusiasm. Furthermore, the salaries distributed across various industries are flowing back into the market, so while credit remains tight, the shortage of cash is not as severe as it was yesterday. As a result, bullish investors are actively buying, and the market is soaring. At the opening of the Chinese stock market, Taiwan Sugar once again reached its ninth consecutive limit, trading at 25,930 yuan. Following closely behind were Yongye, New Asia, Hengfeng, Commercial Press, and Great China Match, each also reaching their respective daily limits. Yongsha opened at 3.61 yuan, with securities firms eagerly bidding up the price, leading to consistently high market momentum. At one point, it approached the daily limit, trading at 3.85 yuan (3.86 yuan being the daily limit price). However, due to the continued tightness of credit, individual investors were unable to bear the heavy burden and turned from buyers to sellers, causing the market to decline, reaching a low of 3.51 yuan. Near the close, news spread that the listed price of US dollars had been raised to 2,950 yuan, reigniting investor confidence and driving the price up to close at 3.76 yuan. The American-Asiatic Company also reached its daily limit. Other stocks reaching their limits included China-Feng, Sino-Russian, Zhabei, Jingfu, Rongfeng, New Light, and Franco-Chinese, totaling seven.

### Foreign Stocks Soar

The trend in foreign stocks is one of comprehensive price increases. In the Green sector, this is mainly due to the easing of credit yesterday, leading short sellers to become long buyers. Ewo Yarns traded at 7,400 yuan and 7,600 yuan, a significant increase of over 1,000 yuan from the previous day. Jardine Matheson also jumped by 1,000 yuan, trading high at 7,700 yuan. Wheelock Marden saw robust buying interest, driving the market price consistently higher, reaching a high of 22,000 yuan, an increase of 4,000 yuan from the previous day. All other stocks also reported increases ranging from 20% to 30%.

### Salt Industry Production Loans: Four Measures Approved by the Rediscount Committee

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Central Bank's Rediscount Committee has approved the following four measures regarding salt industry production loans for the 38th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1949] for various regions: (1) Salt industry production loans for the 38th year are approved based on the distribution plan proposed by the Salt Administration for seven regions (Taiwan, Guangdong-Guangxi, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Fujian, Sichuan-Kangding, Northern Sichuan, and Yunnan), with a total loan amount limited to 845 million yuan. (2) Once this plan is approved, these seven regions will not be allowed to request additional loans during this year. (3) These loans will be distributed by the five banks—Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, and China Industrial and Commercial Bank—in proportions of 35%, 30%, 15%, 10%, and 10%, respectively. The Bank of China will serve as the lead bank. The loan term is three months, with a monthly interest rate of 3.6%, and the loans may be rediscounted with this bank at 90% of their face value, with the rediscount interest rate calculated by deducting 0.3% from the original lending rate. (4) The distribution of these loans should be handled fairly and transparently by a distribution supervision committee jointly formed by the local branch of this bank, the relevant salt administration authority, the relevant bureaus, and representatives from salt producer and merchant associations in each region, to ensure proper disbursement.

### US Aid Cotton to Be Exchanged for Yarn; Consolidated Tax to Be Borne by the Committee

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The US Aid Cotton Technical Group held a meeting yesterday to discuss the ratio of US aid cotton to yarn for the third phase.

The specific measures will be finalized tomorrow morning and then submitted to a joint meeting of the US Aid Cotton Committee and the US Aid Cotton Yarn Cloth Joint Operation Office for a final decision.

### The Amount of Export Foreign Exchange Settlement Last Week Was Similar to the Previous Week

Third was cloth at US$312,573.07. Tung oil also accounted for US$303,071.80.

### Yarn and Cloth Reaching New Highs; Sentiment Unanimously Bullish Due to Price Fluctuations in Goods Outside the Industry

Due to fluctuations in prices of goods outside the cotton yarn industry, holders are in high spirits, with little intention of selling at low prices. As a result, the market is booming, with average prices for various yarns jumping by about 20%.

42-count Blue Phoenix opened at a high of 1.06 million yuan and closed even higher at 1.09 million yuan, a surge of 190,000 yuan. Other brands such as Bao Guang and Jincheng also opened above the 1 million yuan mark.

40-count Blue Phoenix initially traded at 950,000 yuan, but due to strong demand from the local market, it surged to close at 1.02 million yuan, an increase of 130,000 yuan.

32-count Silver Moon closed strong at 820,000 yuan, also up by 130,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse spot goods rose by 85,000 yuan, closing at 655,000 yuan. Factory orders closed at 615,000 yuan and were offered at 650,000 yuan for delivery the following day.

20-count Double Horse opened at 570,000 yuan in the morning and finally settled above the 600,000 yuan mark at noon. Other brands such as Jincheng and Tiannv also opened around 600,000 yuan. Prices for all other yarns reached unprecedented highs.

Cotton cloth prices rose again yesterday, with the market opening strong in the morning. This was due to a slight easing of tight credit within the industry, leading to renewed market optimism and active buying. There was also healthy retail demand from the Nanjing and Hangzhou areas.

Leading fine cloth started at 24,600 yuan and rose to 25,600 yuan. Subsequently, as some investors sold off their positions to realize profits, the market gradually eased, closing at 25,300 yuan at noon, a sharp increase of 3,300 yuan from the previous day. In the afternoon, buying interest from outside the market grew even stronger, and prices were bid up to 30,000 yuan.

Si Junzi Yuan Bi Ji fluctuated from a high of 23,000 yuan down to a low of 22,850 yuan, before rising again to 24,000 yuan near noon, closing at 23,900 yuan, also up by 3,300 yuan. In the afternoon, it continued to rise to 28,700 yuan.

La Ba Tong fine cloth surged by 3,200 yuan, closing at 23,500 yuan. Jin Lian Miao Wu finally rose by 2,500 yuan. Factory prices for other colored and patterned cloths increased by about 30%.

China Textile Corporation Yarn Sales

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The China Textile Construction Corporation sold yarn as usual yesterday, offering a total of nine types, selling 141 lots to 78 approved purchasers, with a total value of 127,575,000 yuan.

### Silk Soars

Yesterday, the artificial silk market continued its strong upward trend, with prices improving rapidly. Credit in the market went from loose to tight, and interest rates went from low to high, with prices rising across the board at noon.

120-count Tianqiao opened at 820,000 yuan with supply available. Some small investors, recognizing the tight credit and rising interest rates, sold off inventory to lend out money. Initially, there was ample supply on the market, and the market appeared weak. Later, it was rumored that additional capital from other regions had arrived, and financial goods had been suppressed for days, causing capital to flow outward. After 11:00 AM, buying surged, and the market became very active, closing high at 880,000 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, credit eased, and banknotes rose after falling. Prices of goods outside the industry were all high, so bullish investors moved forward boldly, and the market rose again, hovering near the 1 million yuan mark before settling back down to 960,000 yuan.

Yesterday, the raw silk market saw a relatively stable trend in foreign exchange certificates, and participants initially took a wait-and-see approach, with little market movement. Later, news that prices of goods outside the industry were rising across the board also drove the market upward. Superior grade spot goods first traded at 950,000 yuan, with strong local demand. Prices gradually rose, fluctuating around 1 million yuan. The upward trend did not weaken, and prices continued to rise after reaching a high, ultimately closing at 1.03 million yuan at noon.

Prices for silk fabrics also rose as raw material prices soared, boosting sentiment. Credit in the industry eased slightly, but interest rates remained high. Holders held on tightly, and prices ultimately surged. American-Asiatic opened at 560,000 yuan and briefly rose to 570,000 yuan. Later, news that gold prices were rising again caused the market to shift, and credit tightened after initially easing. Bullish investors took advantage of the high prices to sell, causing the market to fall back to 550,000 yuan. The market then rebounded and prices rose again, fluctuating around 560,000 yuan. Near noon, all goods saw good momentum, and sentiment was strong, with prices rising from 560,000 yuan to close at 568,000 yuan.

### Market Notes

The Onlooker:

As America Opens Gold Prices, the US Dollar May Jump by 50%

Regarding the opening up of gold and silver trading, the Ministry of Finance has already approved the establishment of public gold and silver markets in Guangzhou and Shanghai. The Shanghai Gold Exchange is unwilling to bear the risk of paying the resumption fee and would rather transfer its site rights to the Securities Exchange, with the old brokers following.

Of course, the urgent need to list and auction gold price bonds and the realization of a gold and silver market are both imminent.

International gold and silver trading has also begun to shift from control towards openness. Even in the United States, there are proposals to restore a free world gold market.

Recently, the New York Daily Tribune also published an article advocating the establishment of a free gold market. The gist of it is that US production has not yet become excessive, and the world's demand for US goods is increasing, so the United States can abandon its official gold price of US$35 per ounce. As a result of the world's need for US dollars, the price of pure gold may fall to US$20 per ounce.

This is equivalent to saying that the world's gold price may fall by 40% to 50% against the US dollar. That is, the US dollar will then rise sharply by 40% to 50% against the price of gold.

However, the United States is the big boss of the International Monetary Fund, and the international standard currency is denominated in US dollars. If the United States really abandons the official gold price, although a large rise in the value of the US dollar against the world's gold prices is certainly possible, a disturbance in the international foreign exchange market order is also highly likely.

When the market opened this morning, credit was very tight, but it eased significantly in the afternoon, with banks making public, large-scale disbursements.

The stock market is the most sensitive. After opening, it rose sharply despite the still-tight credit, followed by numerous limit-ups. This also greatly changed the situation in the commodity market. The excitement was even greater in the afternoon.

According to the recent movements of general speculative capital, it pulled up stocks in the morning and gold banknotes and silver dollars in the afternoon. Yesterday, the price of gold was reported to be 180,000 yuan, the US dollar rose to 3,600-3,700 yuan, and silver dollars also reached 2,300-2,400 yuan. As a result, the Western medicine market, which is most closely related to foreign exchange, also saw great activity. For example, the popular drug Vogan jumped from 850 yuan to 1,400 yuan. It can be said that this was the commodity with the biggest price increase in the market yesterday.

As Banks Disbursed Funds, Gold, Silver, Stocks, and Banknotes All Rose Together

### Credit Tightness Eases Slightly; Rice Prices Rise Again; Flour Prices Soar; Oil Prices Increase

Rice prices are rising. As the tightness of credit eases slightly, sentiment becomes more optimistic, and owners raise prices. Prices opened 500-600 yuan higher in the morning, and prices continued to rise as demand remained strong. North Market White Geng rose by 900 yuan, trading at 16,900 yuan. Thin-husked rice rose by 1,100 yuan, with special Geng rice trading at a high of 18,500 yuan. Shade-dried white rice rose by 700-800 yuan. In the South Market, white Geng rice was at 16,500 yuan, thin-husked rice and early rice rose by 800-1,000 yuan, special Geng rice was at 17,000 yuan, and Xian rice trading was very sparse. A total of 5,591 shi of rice arrived at the North and South markets yesterday.

Flour

Soaring fiercely. As the market opened, credit eased and buying interest from the North increased, leading to price increases for all goods. Lao Che flour traded at 7,950 yuan yesterday, briefly touching the 8,000 yuan mark. Bing Chuan flour jumped above the 7,000 yuan mark at the opening, reaching a high of 7,500 yuan. In the Central Market, as prices of other goods weakened, owners were wary of holding high positions and sold off a lot of inventory, causing the market to decline at one point. However, as actual sales remained strong, prices rose again at the close, trading at 7,450 yuan. Bran rose by 10%, with Da Bao Fuxin trading at 6,150 yuan.

Grains

Rising across the board. Soybean prices increased by 10% across the board. Che Dou briefly reached 17,000 yuan before falling by 1,000 yuan at the close due to the weakening oilseed cake market. Sentiment softened. Zha Dou rose sharply by 2,000 yuan, trading at 14,000 yuan today. Shelled peanuts sold well, rising by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Yangzhou Ti Zhuang surged past the 40,000 yuan mark. Sesame prices have risen too much in recent days. White sesame has become stable, while yellow sesame has risen rapidly by 10%. Red sorghum increased by 1,000 yuan across the board, and corn saw a slight increase.

Edible Oil

The market is rising. As credit has eased slightly, people are bullish.

### Tung Oil Surges

Tung oil soared yesterday. As gold and goods aligned with the surge in prices for goods outside the industry, and with prices of public utilities rising across the board, sentiment soared despite tight credit. Buying interest was sky-high, and sellers were adamant. The upward trend continued to grow, with the market constantly moving towards new peaks. By the close, prices for various brands had surged by 3,000-7,000 yuan.

### Medium-Thick Serge Sells Well

Yesterday, the trend for medium-thick dark serge was upwards, and retail prices rose again.

Merchants from Nanjing and Hangzhou were eager to buy, leading to strong sales. The game of speculative trading has therefore started again. Another reason for the strong sales is that there are many orders for Zhongshan suits and student uniforms.

### Tea Market Trends Upwards

Yesterday, the tea market continued to show its brilliance. Due to the tight credit situation, industry players faced heavy pressure. However, tea stocks were depleted, and apart from limited arrivals from various parts of Zhejiang, other areas such as Wutun had become choked off. Furthermore, stimulated by the soaring prices of everything, holders continued to struggle, unwilling to let go at low prices, and the market trended upwards. However, transactions were limited due to buyers' difficulty in absorbing the high prices, with only sporadic trading.

### Sugar Market Continues to Rise

Yesterday, the Taiwan sugar market rose before falling. Initially, due to the influx of outside capital, buying interest was strong, and sentiment was quite bullish. Later, as credit eased before tightening again, sentiment weakened slightly, and prices gradually fell. However, prices were still up significantly at noon.

No. 45 Che Bai Jing initially traded at 315,000 yuan, and coarse sand also reached 307,000 yuan. Prices rose and fell in the middle, ultimately hovering at high levels. Subsequently, as merchants from other regions sold more than they bought, closing out positions one after another, prices fell sharply. No. 4 1/2 closed at 310,000 yuan at noon, and coarse sand closed at 303,000 yuan at noon, each rising by 1,600 yuan. Other types of sugar, such as white, red, and refined, all rose by about 1,000 yuan.

### World Boxing Champion "Brown Bomber" Joe Louis Retires; Earned Nearly $4 Million from Boxing Matches in Twelve Years

"I am happy to retire. Retirement relieves me of a heavy burden. I feel I am no longer able to fight. Rather than lose the title in the ring, it is better to retire voluntarily."

[Wire Service Report] Miami, Florida, 1st - Brown Bomber Joe Louis officially announced his retirement today, and the world heavyweight boxing throne, which Joe Louis has occupied for twelve years, has been vacant from today.

Louis' retirement does not mean that he is cutting himself off from the boxing world. He has applied to the National Boxing Association to host a new championship final between Walcott, whom he has defeated twice, and famous boxer Charles. The match will be held in Chicago in June and is scheduled for fifteen rounds.

Louis and Walcott, Norris organize the International Boxing Association, with offices in New York and Chicago. The Walcott-Charles showdown will be hosted by this newly established organization. Louis said that both Walcott and Charles have signed contracts agreeing to compete and that both have agreed to accept the challenge of Saward or Lisnerovich within ninety days of the new champion's emergence.

Louis' retirement application was sent to the National Boxing Association by his secretary, Mengdaoer. After review, it was announced by Green, the person in charge. Green also said that the association has thoroughly reviewed Louis' plan to host a championship to determine the new champion and "will provide assistance." He also said: "The Walcott-Charles final is not a guaranteed seat. The winner of the match must sign a contract guaranteeing Saward or Lisnerovich the opportunity to challenge the title holder in the shortest possible time.

Louis' retirement has saddened Joe Koerner, the person in charge of the 20th Century Sporting Association, which has always been in charge of hosting the Boxing Championship. Koerner had originally planned to arrange a grand championship for Louis this summer. This sudden news forced Koerner to abandon all plans. He even declared: "I will have to retire with Louis."

After retirement, Louis still plans to travel to Central and South America for exhibition matches.

Joe Louis is 34 years old this year and has held the title of boxing champion for eleven years, eight months and seven days since June 22, 1937, when he knocked down Brad Dock in Chicago. He is the first person in boxing history to do so.

Louis is also the youngest boxing champion. He was only 23 years old when he first won the crown. Louis came from humble beginnings, born in a wooden shed in Alabama on May 13, 1914.

Louis' first professional boxing match in 1934 earned him only $50. Since then, he has had smooth sailing. As of this year, his income from boxing matches, according to "The Ring" magazine, has reached $3,887,323.

Also, Joe Louis announced tonight that he believes the Chicago Stadium venue for the Walcott-Charles fight is too small, so "no formal decision has yet been made as to where it will be held."

[United Press International, Miami, Florida, 1st] World heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis formally wrote to the National Boxing Commission today, declaring his voluntary retirement and requesting permission to create an International Boxing Federation to host boxing matches. The Boxing Commission has granted his request.

Joe Louis has maintained an unbeaten record since ascending to the throne in 1937. His resolute retirement to fulfill his long-cherished ambition has made fans sad.

According to Joe, "I am happy to retire. Retirement relieves me of a heavy burden. I feel I am no longer able to fight. Rather than lose the title in the ring, it is better to retire voluntarily."

### Crowds in the Bahamas Greet the Boxing King

[Reuters, Nassau, Bahamas, 1st] Boxing King Joe Louis arrived here today for an exhibition match. As he drove from the airport into the city, tens of thousands of people lined the streets to welcome him. The enthusiasm was even greater than when the Duke of Windsor arrived here in 1940 to take office as Governor of the Bahamas.

A thrilling shot of Joe Louis knocking down Belekang.

### HONG KONG SILVER SHIELD SOCCER: KIT CHEE DEFEATS POLICE, WILL FACE SOUTH CHINA IN THE FINAL

[Hong Kong Aviation News] In the Hong Kong Special Silver Shield soccer semi-finals, after South China defeated St. Joseph's 1-0 last Saturday, Kit Chee also defeated the Police 2-1 the next day. Now, the two teams, South China and Kit Chee, will compete for the championship.

The 90-minute match between Kit Chee and the Police was nerve-wracking. Every minute was like a wild storm, with the Police's goal area in chaos more than a dozen times. Zhao Fu, Zhang Songgen, and Huang Jingcong from Kit Chee had to leave the field due to injuries, and several players from both sides received warnings, which shows how tense and exciting the game was.

Kit Chee's victory over the Police was due to the united efforts of the entire team and their high morale. Each player moved forward bravely and showed no fear of the field. Kit Chee's center-back, You Huaxing, played the best, keeping Hou Lu and Gordon under control and not giving them an inch. The forwards cooperated effectively. "Crazy Horse" Zhao Fu played with some brains, and Ya Qi and Songgen did their duty as forwards. Yao Zhuoran has made great progress, and his dribbling and shooting skills are good. Given time, this young man has a great future. Jingcong, as the left-winger, was also able to coordinate with the center. The entire forward line was able to maintain a cohesive flow from beginning to end. It was truly remarkable to achieve victory in such a difficult and challenging match.

### FRIENDLY SOCCER MATCH: RAILWAY TIES BRITISH NAVY 1-1

[Reported by this newspaper] In a Sino-British friendly soccer match between the Railway team and the British Navy, held at Yiyuan yesterday at 4:00 PM. The British sailors were from the HMS London team. Both sides agreed to use British soccer rules, with no substitutions allowed and a limit of eleven players per team. Railway player Xiao Ziwen was late, and ultimately could not play. The British army launched fierce offensive, scoring a goal in the first half. The Railway team did not score until the last ten minutes, when Wu Binghao carried the ball into the net, leveling the score, ending the game in a 1-1 draw. The Railway team was spared the humiliation of defeat. In the second half, British center-back Bo Peiqi was injured in the eye by the ball, leaving them with only ten players to fight to the end. Only about a thousand spectators attended at Yiyuan.

This was a game of strength. The British sailors were as strong as bulls, tall and powerful, running fast, and moving quickly. The Railway team was no match in any respect, lacking the strength and size. They were at a disadvantage in every aspect of the first half, with the British army constantly attacking. Center forward Heggs was the best, but unfortunately the forwards lacked coordination and organization, otherwise they would have won by a large margin. All that was seen was running around the field and high balls being exchanged. In the second half, the British sailors fought to the end with ten players. The Railway team seemed tired in the second half because they had used their strength fiercely in the first half. Thinking that there was no hope of a comeback, they were pleasantly surprised by Wu Binghao's goal. The Railway team's avoidance of defeat was truly fortunate.

The British army attacked fiercely in the first half, with the Railway team only following behind. Because the British army adopted an offensive tactic, the defenders were too far forward, so the Railway team's several counterattacks were also quite effective. Unfortunately, Lin Dianyi was a step late on one occasion, and his shot was too accurate, hitting the goalkeeper in the hands. Wu Binghao and Qu Xigen's long shots were also ineffective. On one occasion, British center-back Bo Peiqi almost scored an own goal. Until half an hour later, British center forward Heggs dribbled past three defenders and scored a goal, opening the scoring. The score was 1-0 in the first half. In the second half, Bo Peiqi injured his eye, and the British army played with ten players, focusing entirely on defense, losing all the excitement. The Railway team also showed signs of fatigue. In the last ten minutes, Zhang Jie got the ball and dribbled straight forward, passing left to Lu Qingxiang. Lu jumped up and headed the ball, but Tetteman caught it and dropped it. Wu Binghao carried the ball and himself into the net, ending the game in a 1-1 tie.
