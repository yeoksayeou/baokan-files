### Acting President Li Tells Supervisors He Will Do His Utmost to Promote Peace; Summons Wu Yuru and Others for Detailed Inquiries About the Communist Sideâ€™s Opinions; Yan Huiqing and His Entourage Arrive Safely in Beiping

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Acting President Li formally expressed to the more than 50 supervisors who came to Nanjing on the 14th his determination to do his utmost to promote peace. He said: Although there are still many difficulties in the future of peace, he is determined to seek it with the greatest patience. He believes that he will eventually succeed. Acting President Li's confidence in the future of peace has left a deep impression on the supervisors. Acting President Li stated that peace is the current need, and the people of any region need peace. Politics lose its meaning if it departs from the demands of the people. Based on this point of view, he believes that the peace he is working for will eventually be realized. The supervisors had previously submitted a letter to Acting President Li, inquiring about the following four matters, to which Acting President Li gave oral answers: (1) Regarding the issue of the Executive Yuan moving to Guangzhou, the Legislative Yuan was not consulted in advance, nor was a presidential order obtained. The procedure was improper, and the Supervisory Yuan has filed a censure motion. Acting President Li stated: He hopes to make the Executive Yuan return to Nanjing as much as possible, or at least have the heads of the ministries and commissions return to Nanjing to work. (2) The Central Bank should be prevented from transporting its gold and silver reserves south. Acting President Li stated: After he took office, the Central Bank's gold and silver have not been transported south again. (3) Regarding the retention of troop designations and the supply of military necessities, food, and pay, since some troop designations have become nominal or the number of personnel is insufficient after fierce battles, military necessities, food, and pay should be issued based on actual needs to avoid abuse. Acting President Li stated: He will discuss this matter with Mr. He Jingzhi (Yingqin). (4) Regarding the issue of the future of peace, Acting President Li stated: The government is determined to seek it with the greatest sincerity and effort.

[United Press, Nanjing, 14th] Wu Yuru told the United Press on the 14th that Acting President Li was satisfied with the "preconditions" set by the Chinese Communists for opening peace talks and allowed him to do his utmost to meet the conditions set by the Chinese Communists. These conditions were given to the delegation by General Ye Jianying to be forwarded to the Nanjing government. Wu Yuru still refused to disclose the content, but stated that Acting President Li allowed immediate action to be taken to carry out the preconditions that he could implement without consulting the Executive Yuan in his capacity, and that he would soon discuss other preconditions with the Executive Yuan. He also stated that Acting President Li expressed optimism about the prospect of a peaceful resolution and would use various means to achieve a peaceful resolution. The acting president also hoped that the Chinese Communists would also "understand him and the government's" sincerity in politically resolving China's long-term civil war.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] At 9:00 a.m. on the 14th, Acting President Li summoned the representatives of the People's Peace Delegation who had gone to Beiping to listen to their account of the negotiations with the Chinese Communist personnel. However, due to internal disagreements within the delegation, only Wu Yuru, Wu Zhesheng, and Miao Diqing went to visit. Acting President Li inquired in detail about the opinions of the Chinese Communist side, and Wu and others reported in detail. They left around 10:00 a.m. Wu and the other two flew to Shanghai by plane in the afternoon of the 14th. Another representative of the delegation, Qiu Zhizhong, also went to Shanghai on the morning of the 14th. (Please read the fourth page for news after Wu and Qiu arrive in Shanghai.)

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 14th] The special plane carrying the Shanghai Peace Delegation departed Qingdao for Beiping at 1:45 p.m. on the 14th. On the morning of the 14th, a telegram came from the Communist side in Beiping, refusing to allow the accompanying personnel to travel with them. After the delegation telegraphed the entire list to Beiping at noon and made further contact, they finally obtained the Communist side's consent. The delegation went to Cangku Airport from the Guest House at 10:00 a.m. to wait for the plane. The tire of the special plane exploded during landing yesterday. China Airlines flight 515 flew from Shanghai to Qingdao at 7:50 a.m. to bring a new tire to repair the peace special plane.

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 14th] Gu Lecun, the telecommunications section chief dispatched by Shanghai China Airlines, accompanied the Shanghai Peace Delegation via Qingdao to Beiping to negotiate with the Communist side on aviation issues in the Kuomintang-Communist areas.

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 14th] Huang Qihan, a representative of the Shanghai Peace Delegation, met with reporters and directly denied seeking a "glorious peace." Huang said: "Peace is for the people, there is no such thing as glory or shame." This morning, the local newspapers reported that Huang had said, "What we seek is a glorious, permanent peace, not a temporary peace." Huang personally wrote a letter to correct this, saying, "I did not mention the word 'glory,' but only said 'a real, permanent peace.'"

[Our Newspaper] According to China Airlines: The special plane of the Shanghai Peace Delegation, which left Shanghai for Beiping the day before yesterday, stopped in Qingdao overnight. After the tires were replaced yesterday, it continued to take off from Qingdao at 1:15 p.m. and arrived safely in Beiping at 4:30 p.m. During their talks with the Communist side, the special plane will stay in Beiping so that the delegation can take it back to Shanghai after the mission is completed.

[Our Newspaper] Gan Jiehou, Acting President Li's personal representative, left Shanghai at noon on the 14th to return to Nanjing to report to Acting President Li on the arrangements for the Peace Delegation's trip to Beiping. It is also said that Gan will come to Shanghai again when the delegation returns south.

He denied the rumors that he would assume an important military position, but he also did not disclose what position he would hold. He met with a group of visiting reporters after arriving at his residence in Nanjing. Regarding the peace issue, He said that peace was needed by the people of the whole country, and everyone thought it was best not to fight anymore, so he intended to stay in Nanjing to assist Acting President Li in striving for peace. He also believed that peace should be resolved through negotiations between the two sides, and he apparently disagreed with mediation by the United Nations. As for his future whereabouts, he refused to express his opinion, but said that he had planned to retire after the victory. As for whether he would go to Taiwan or Guangzhou, he said he had not considered it yet. He's hemorrhoids had healed. A reporter asked if he could drink alcohol now that he was better.

According to relevant sources: Zhang did send separate telegrams to Acting President Li and Premier Sun on the 6th of this month, requesting to resign from the representative task. Acting President Li telegraphed back on the 7th to comfort and retain him, and asked Zhang to come to Nanjing immediately. Zhang believed that his responsibilities in the Northwest were important and feared that he would make mistakes, so he telegraphed again on the 10th to earnestly decline. He is currently awaiting Acting President Li's reply for approval.

[United Press, Guangzhou, 14th] A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on the 14th that China and the Soviet Union have not yet reached an agreement on the Xinjiang trade agreement. The negotiations are being held by Liu Zhirong, special envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Xinjiang, and the Soviet consul in Dihua, and are still in the exploratory stage. They have been intermittent for the past two years, and Zhang Zhizhong has personally presided over them since last month.

### Tong Guanxian Travels Between Nanjing and Shanghai; Attends Discussions of Legislators in Both Places; The Location of the Legislative Yuan's Resumption of Meetings Can Be Decided

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] President of the Legislative Yuan Tong Guanxian arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai by car around 7:00 a.m. on the 14th. After resting briefly at his private residence, he went to the Legislative Yuan to handle official business. In the afternoon, he attended a discussion meeting of legislators in Nanjing to report on his trip to the south. He then visited Acting President Li at 8:00 p.m. for discussions. He then took the night train to Shanghai and will attend a discussion meeting of legislators in Shanghai on the 15th.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] More than 20 legislators in Nanjing held a discussion meeting at 2:00 p.m. on the 14th. Rong Zhao presided over the meeting. First, President Tong, who had just returned from Guangzhou, reported on his trip to the south. Tong gave a general description of his impressions of this trip and reported that some legislators in Guangzhou advocated resuming meetings in Guangzhou, while others agreed to return to Nanjing to resume meetings, and the location of the resumption of meetings would depend on the opinions of various parties. Then, the legislators discussed the issue of resuming meetings, and they all believed that the Legislative Yuan should resume meetings within this month in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. As for the location of the resumption of meetings, they believed that since the government had not moved the capital and the Legislative Yuan had not made a resolution to convene the third session in another location, it was only natural to resume meetings in Nanjing. They also knew for sure that resuming meetings in Nanjing was the unanimous proposal of legislators from Shanghai, Taiwan, Wuhan, and Guilin, and there were still more than 60 staff members of the Legislative Yuan Secretariat remaining in Nanjing, so there were no problems in terms of business. Therefore, it is expected that after the Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, Chen Kewen, returns to Nanjing on the 16th, he will summarize the opinions of legislators from various places and make a final decision so that the meeting notices can be sent out in time.

[Our Newspaper] Regarding the issue of whether the Legislative Yuan will convene in Nanjing or Guangzhou, the Youth Party recently solicited the opinions of legislators of the Youth Party and telegraphed to Youth Party legislators in various places to gather in Shanghai to exchange views in order to discuss the location of the third session of the Legislative Yuan.

### A Major Case of Kidnapping Occurs During the Distribution of Northeast Relief Funds; Mo Dehui is Robbed of 20 Million Yuan Before Leaving Shanghai for Taiwan; The Case is Bizarre and Horrifying; Liu Zhe Requests the Supervisory Yuan to Investigate Thoroughly and Impeach

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The matter of Mo Dehui being "kidnapped" in Shanghai and robbed of 20 million yuan before going to Taiwan has been confirmed on the 14th by Liu Zhe, Vice President of the Supervisory Yuan, who arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai. Liu also jointly proposed a motion with supervisors He Jishu and Chen Lishan for this matter, and submitted it to the Supervisory Yuan's plenary session on the 15th for discussion. According to Liu: Mo distributed 60 million yuan in Northeast relief funds in Shanghai on the 6th, all in the form of Central Bank banknotes worth 20,000 yuan each. By midnight, only a few hundred people had received them. Those who did not receive them questioned the person in charge of the distribution and searched their bodies, finding 400 to 500 banknotes. The four distribution personnel were then sent to the Garrison Headquarters. On the 7th, a man claiming to be "Legislator Feng Yun" asked to see Mo in the office of the Inspector General of the Huangpu Police Bureau. He threatened Mo with a pistol, forcibly demanding a Central Bank check for 20 million yuan, and forced Mo to accompany him to cash it before leaving. This matter is extremely bizarre. Liu has decided that in addition to submitting it to the plenary session, he will also report it to Acting President Li. Liu's request to the Supervisory Yuan to send personnel to investigate the loan fraud of the Northeast Materials Clearing Committee and the robbery of funds by thugs, as well as the distribution of huge sums of money to non-Northeast refugees by people outside the committee who falsely claimed to be it, stated: "It is found that the Northeast Materials Bureau has a lot of materials stored in Tianjin and Shanghai. Zhe and Mr. Mo Liuzhen previously wrote to the President, requesting that a portion be allocated to relieve public educators and refugees in Beijing, Shanghai, Taiwan, Guangzhou, and Chongqing. The President Chiang approved it and handed it over to the Executive Yuan for discussion. Recently, I heard that someone is using the name of the Northeast Materials Clearing Committee to sell the materials at low prices without using auction procedures, planning to distribute 2,000 yuan to each Northeast refugee and 20,000 yuan to each National Assembly representative, legislator, and supervisor, totaling 70 to 80 million yuan. The remaining materials are planned to continue to be sold, worth no less than 400 to 500 million yuan. I also heard that each person in charge used a lot of money, causing public outrage and causing a stir. The Clearing Committee then sent 60 million yuan to the Huangpu Police Bureau for redistribution, but someone robbed and hid more than 30 million yuan in the middle of the night, and it is said that three people have been arrested. There was also someone who forced Mr. Mo with a pistol and robbed him of 20 million yuan, which is like kidnapping. Such a phenomenon occurred in broad daylight, which is extremely bizarre, so that real Northeast refugees could not get it. I also heard that the day after Mr. Mo went to Taiwan, someone who was neither from the Northeast nor from the Clearing Committee distributed 100 million yuan to non-Northeast refugees. I don't know what their intentions are. Please ask the conference to elect a committee to investigate thoroughly and formally impeach them to warn the stubborn."

Karny said he believed there was no immediate war crisis, but we must be prepared just in case. Karny's next destination is Tokyo, and he plans to meet with MacArthur. Karny met with Quirino twice while passing through here. The talks between the two were related to the US-Philippines military aid agreement and the US defense plan in the Philippines. [United Press, Pearl Harbor, 13th] US Pacific Fleet Commander Ramsay said today after returning from an inspection: I cannot say whether the US fleet will withdraw from Qingdao if the Chinese Communists enter Qingdao. This matter should be decided by the commander of the Western Pacific Fleet, Badger, according to the circumstances. The situation in China is changing at any time, and no one can predict it at this moment.

### National Peace Promotion Association Declaration

[This City News] The National Peace Promotion Association held in Shanghai concluded on the 14th and issued the following declaration:

We, representatives of provincial and municipal councils, national professional groups, cultural groups, and women's groups, have been meeting in Shanghai for three days since February 12 of this year to discuss ways to promote national peace. Standing from the perspective of the people, with heavy hearts, we conducted serious discussions and passed a proposal for promoting peace, consisting of two major demands and seven proposals. This proposal has already been published separately, and it has been decided to organize a permanent institution to continue to advance the peace movement based on the resolutions of the conference, seeking the enthusiastic support of compatriots throughout the country. We will not cease until the goal of a ceasefire and cessation of hostilities is achieved. Now, as the conference concludes, we respectfully summarize our beliefs and inform our compatriots throughout the country.

Eight years of war against Japan, three years of civil strife, continuous warfare, and widespread suffering. If this continues, not only will the people have no chance of survival, but the country will inevitably face the fate of destruction. Fortunately, Heaven is tired of chaos, and the violence is gradually subsiding. President Chiang issued a statement advocating peace and resolutely resigned to end the war. Acting President Li is also willing to use the utmost sincerity and effort to seek the realization of peace. Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party also broadcast peace negotiation conditions, showing his willingness to cease hostilities and negotiate peace. Although the CCP has not yet appointed a representative, so the government cannot yet begin peace talks with the CCP, it seems that peace representatives from Nanjing and Shanghai have flown to Peiping one after another to exchange views with the CCP authorities, and the dawn of peace has indeed begun to appear. We, the people who have suffered so much from the ravages of war, cannot afford to miss this opportunity for genuine and comprehensive peace.

First of all, we believe that to promote the realization of peace, there are three points that must be worked hard to achieve: (1) Demand that both sides immediately cease fire on the spot. Only with an immediate ceasefire on all fronts, with neither side attacking each other, neither side raiding each other, and neither side taking any military action, can a path to peace talks be opened, and only then can the sincerity of genuinely seeking peace be demonstrated. (2) Demand that both sides simultaneously stop propaganda attacks. Because the propaganda war and psychological warfare of mutual denigration only serve to provoke each other's animosity and hinder the opportunity to resolve disputes and make amends. Therefore, only by immediately stopping this pointless propaganda attack and eliminating each other's estrangement and doubts can a peaceful atmosphere and environment be created. (3) Demand that both sides quickly appoint responsible representatives to begin comprehensive peace talks in a mutually agreeable location. We know that the government representatives have already been appointed. As long as the CCP can also appoint representatives soon, once peace talks begin, all opinions can be discussed calmly and peacefully at the conference table, and a mutually understanding and reasonable solution can be reached based on the public will. The heavy mood of the compatriots throughout the country in the atmosphere of war can also be eliminated as a result.

Secondly, if we truly want to achieve genuine and lasting peace, rather than an interval between two periods of war, then we must have the following two common understandings as our people's methods and goals for striving for peace:

First, the people must value their own position and strength. Because it is the people who truly need to survive and earnestly desire peace. Only because the people earnestly desire peace are the government and the Communist Party willing to cease hostilities and negotiate peace. And only because the people truly want peace must genuine people's representatives take responsibility and earnestly participate in future national peace conferences, providing impartial and fair opinions, so that the peace movement can be completed smoothly as soon as possible, avoiding repeating the failures of past political consultation conferences.

Second, the purpose of peace is to save the people and to protect the people's survival and freedom. Therefore, the theme of the peace conference should focus on the future national policy and government measures. We believe that the political system can be made suitable for the times under the general principles of freedom, equality, and fraternity, and under the major premise of not changing the national system of the Republic of China. The most important national policies in the future are nothing more than: (1) political democratization, (2) economic socialization, and (3) nationalization of the military. To achieve the first point, the constitution can be amended according to law so that the people of all regions can fully exercise their autonomy. And any undemocratic measures that harm the people's free life and freedom of rights, regardless of the region, must be absolutely abolished so that the human rights that compatriots throughout the country should enjoy can be guaranteed. To achieve the second point, the policy of land reform in the countryside must be thoroughly implemented based on the principle of equal land rights, and the social ills of uneven wealth in cities must be effectively eradicated based on the principle of controlling capital. We need a bloodless social revolution so that the future economic system can achieve the task of national wealth creation through the path of social equality of production. To achieve the third point, we implore both sides to return the military to the country as soon as possible so that the reorganized government can conduct effective reorganization with an impartial attitude, so that the national military can be used to garrison and develop the borders, and those who are discharged and return to their hometowns have a livelihood to depend on. Then, China's infinite human resources can be used for production and construction, and the goal of prosperity and happiness can certainly be achieved.

In short, we ordinary people really feel that we cannot survive today, and we really need to cry out for help! We want to shout to our compatriots throughout the country, regardless of whether they are in the government area or the CCP area, to unite and use action to strive for genuine and lasting peace. Long live democracy and freedom! Long live the Chinese nation! Long live the Republic of China! National Peace Promotion Association, February 14, 38th year of the Republic of China.

Editorial

### How Can the People Realize Their Peace Proposals?

The National Peace Promotion Association held a meeting in Shanghai. Yesterday, after the conference passed the peace proposal and declaration, it has concluded, and the task of implementing the resolutions has fallen on the shoulders of the directors. Judging from the current situation, although peace is hopeful, everyone knows that the task is arduous and the road is long. Therefore, whether the demands of the Peace Promotion Association can be met and whether the proposals can be implemented depends entirely on the efforts of the directors, and especially on the degree of enthusiastic support from the people throughout the country.

On the surface, peace seems to be a matter between the government and the CCP, so everyone who wants peace first appeals and begs to both sides. In reality, peace is a major issue related to the vital interests of the people and must be fought for by the people themselves. As the saying goes, "God helps those who help themselves." The happiness of peace can never be achieved by relying on the warring parties to bestow it upon us without our own efforts. Therefore, whether peace can be obtained or not, we do not need to ask about the intentions of the government and the CCP, but only need to ask ourselves whether the people have the determination and perseverance to realize their proposals!

The two major demands of immediate ceasefire and comprehensive peace resolved by the National Peace Promotion Association cannot be said to be irrelevant and urgent. The seven proposals it resolved, especially political democratization, economic socialization, nationalization of the military, open press freedom, and protection of human rights and the people's free way of life, are all items that everyone currently believes must be done. As for the participation of people's representatives in the National Peace Conference, it is even more of a matter of course. As long as the people do not want to be lambs to be slaughtered, no one will disapprove. However, it is not easy to ensure that this eloquent declaration, urgent demands, and wonderful proposals can be cashed in. It is not about sitting and talking, but about taking action.

How can we, the people, act to realize our proposals? Without offering any profound theories, we believe that we still need to do practical and hard work. Mr. Li Rentzai, a representative of the conference, said: "I hope that everyone has the spirit of Gandhi saving India, and we will surely achieve peace and save China." Indeed, Gandhi is a suffering Bodhisattva! His non-cooperation movement is a method of doing practical and hard work. To win peace from under the clutches of warmongers who rely on international backgrounds, we must have the same sincerity and courage as Gandhi. We must first exhaust all methods to awaken the self-awareness of all the people, break the artificial "iron curtain" that separates us people from people, so that the people in the government-controlled areas and the CCP-controlled areas can freely communicate news, freely express their opinions, and freely shout out their appeals to the authorities for "peace." Until now, we have not made enough effort to convey our sincere and urgent appeals to the ears of the majority of people in the CCP-controlled areas. Until now, whenever a place is controlled by the CCP, the people cannot see a single real piece of news. The recent return of Nanjing people's representatives from Peiping said that various newspapers in Peiping have become a set of propaganda articles, which can prove this. Therefore, the first step is that we must use all methods to awaken the resonance of compatriots throughout the country for striving for peace, rather than just shouting in this one area.

When the people in the CCP area can shout "help" and "peace" as sincerely as we do, we can truly achieve "uniting the strength of the people throughout the country to promote comprehensive peace." We, the people, have also made a great determination and have many ways to force the warmongers on both sides to lay down their weapons. But these things must be done by mobilizing the people on both sides towards the same goal to have meaning. Otherwise, if one side does not conscript soldiers while the other side still joins the army, and if one side does not levy food while the other side still contributes food, the war will still be unavoidable. Therefore, the people's means of stopping the war are not absent, but the prerequisite is that we must unite the people throughout the country and use action to fight for it.

When the people throughout the country are still separated by the artificial "iron curtain" and cannot unite together, we have no choice but to seek second best in order to strive for the realization of peace. We may as well refer to Gandhi's spirit of non-resistance and non-cooperation and mobilize the peace-loving people throughout the country to organize "People's Peace Corps" to block the fire of war. The government has long said that it wants to end the war, and the Communist Party has also repeatedly said that it wants to "liberate" the people. If they do not give us peace, we can gather under the banner of the "People's Peace Corps," with tens of thousands of civilians, empty-handed, organize several detachments, and everyone go to the front line to demand a ceasefire and peace from both parties. Everyone should not think that this is a later story. It must be known that the Communist Party can use "human wave tactics" to fight. Why can't we, the people, use "human wave peace defense" to seek peace? The greatest power in the world is none other than human power. We, the people, have great human power. We can fight if we seek war, and we can obtain peace if we seek peace. Indeed, we, the people, cannot survive and have long been crying out for help! Today, we need several naive fools, self-willing suffering bodhisattvas like Gandhi, to lead countless peace-loving and unarmed people to organize "People's Peace Corps" to build a "peace wall" in the flames of war to replace the trenches of war!

### Truman Reports to Congress on Aid to China; Special Efforts Being Made to Benefit Government Areas

[United Press Washington 14th] President Truman told Congress on the 14th that American aid to China must be a supplement to China's own efforts to promote production and supply, and cannot replace China's own efforts. Truman submitted a report on the activities of the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) up to August 30, 1948, to the House and Senate committees. Truman said that special efforts were being made to ensure that ECA supplies would benefit areas controlled by the Chinese Central Government and besieged cities in North China as much as possible. In his report, the President outlined the situation of the aid to China program, listing various goals and exported goods. He said, "ECA cotton has kept the machinery of China's largest industry turning, supplying important cotton textiles not only for China's domestic market but also for export to other countries in the Far East." As of September 30, 1948, ECA had authorized the shipment of 372,349 bales of raw cotton worth US$54.7 million to China. He said that the cotton imported into China through ECA funds "is only enough to maintain the current productivity of China's textile production."

### Four Powers' Representatives Discuss Austrian Peace Treaty; Allow Austrian and Yugoslav Representatives to Present Their Views; Heated Debate Arises Over Reparations Issue

[Report from Our Agency] London, 14th Broadcast: Today, at the Austrian Peace Treaty Conference, the four powers agreed to allow representatives from Yugoslavia and Austria to present their views on the scene. It was also decided to immediately notify Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister Bebler that if Mr. Bebler has special views to express, he may attend the meeting, and Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber was also notified to come to the scene to debate. Today, when discussing Yugoslavia's demand for $150 million in reparations from Austria, the four powers had a heated debate. Representatives of Western countries believed that the Potsdam Agreement stipulated that no reparations should be forcibly demanded from Austria. Soviet representative Zaru Ping argued that the agreement stated that the four powers should not demand reparations from Austria, while Yugoslavia's demands should still be considered. Mr. Zaru's speech was quite cautious, and he tried his best to avoid the intention of favoring Yugoslavia, only expressing that Yugoslavia may revise its demands on Austria, so it is necessary to listen to its views. However, Bebler may not attend the meeting in the next few days. In addition, the Soviet Union's request for the concession of some oil fields in Austria and the request to transport a part of the German property in Austria worth $150 million to the Soviet Union, these two points will be discussed again in tomorrow's meeting.

### British Foreign Secretary Exerts Efforts to Win Over Turkey; To Become a Link in the Anti-Communist Camp; Norway's Difficult Situation Has Been Understood by Britain

[United Press, London, 14th Dispatch] Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange secretly discussed the North Atlantic Treaty and the Soviet Union's proposals to Norway with Foreign Secretary Bevin on the 14th. Mr. Lange went to the British Foreign Office at 11:30 AM for talks. This meeting may have a significant impact on Norway's search for security. Bevin plans to meet with Mr. Lange again at the Norwegian Embassy banquet on the evening of the 14th and also plans to meet with Turkish Foreign Minister Sadak in the afternoon. Turkey, like Norway, may become a link in the European anti-communist camp. Mr. Lange also wants to inquire with Bevin about his views on the possible Scandinavian alliance. It is said that Mr. Lange is increasingly expressing sympathy for this.

Norway's difficult situation is due to the pressure from the Soviet Union not to participate in any treaty on the one hand, and the pressure from Sweden to join the Scandinavian defense alliance without joining the Atlantic Treaty on the other hand. It is said that the British side has adopted an "understanding" attitude towards Norway's situation.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th Dispatch] Turkish Foreign Minister Sadak, who came to England, was invited by British Foreign Secretary Bevin for lunch at noon today and will meet with Bevin again in the British Foreign Office in the afternoon. He will leave England for Paris tomorrow.

[United Press, London, 14th Dispatch] Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange recently told reporters, "We now have some facts about the situation, and he believes that we will proceed slowly and cannot make a decision immediately." This slow-moving policy applies not only to the Atlantic Treaty but also to the proposed Scandinavian alliance and the Soviet Union's proposed Soviet-Norwegian non-aggression pact. Britain wants Norway to participate in the Atlantic Treaty but is avoiding putting pressure on it. After Foreign Secretary Bevin met with Mr. Lange today, he also received Turkish Foreign Minister Sadak. Sadak has rejected the possibility of Turkey joining the Atlantic Treaty, but he secretly implied that a Mediterranean alliance could be established, linked to the Atlantic Treaty. At the same time, the British authorities have temporarily abandoned the hope of bringing Ireland into the Atlantic Treaty because the Irish Foreign Minister has clearly stated that Ireland is not prepared to participate in the treaty until Britain agrees to the reunification of North and South Ireland, but this matter has been rejected by London.

### Significant Achievements of the US Aid to Europe Program

Truman Reports to Congress

[United Press, Washington, 14th Dispatch] President Truman today submitted the second term's COA (Cooperation Organization Administration) activity report as of August 30th, 1948, as the two-house committee is considering the $5.58 billion EU assistance. Truman claims that the communist propaganda that attempts to damage the COA has failed. He claims that he is optimistic about this plan and has provided numbers and charts to verify his statement that: "We have gained achievements in the revival of Western Europe." In his report, the president claims that the preliminary goal of the "European Revival Plan" is to ensure that Western Europe achieves a satisfactory level of economic activity as soon as possible, without relying on additional external aid. Western Europe must be self-sufficient, but it must avoid reducing people's living standards to the point of losing their original levels, as this will cause suffering and anxiety. Although the COA's report is four months behind the current revival work, it still reflects the gains in Western Europe since the Marshall Plan began last April. For example, "The total industrial and mining output in the third term of 1948 increased by 10% compared to the previous year. Except for the reduction in steel output in West Germany, steel output is far higher than the productivity in 1938. Agricultural production in Europe also had significantly high harvests compared to the previous year, although the total output is still lower than before the war. Regarding Europe's labor supply and production capacity, the report pointed out that the distribution of labor must be more effective, and the level of production capacity must also be improved.

[Report from Our Agency] The National Peace Promotion Association held its third and fourth general meetings yesterday at the Shanghai Municipal Council building on Tanggu Road, respectively in the morning and afternoon. In addition to successfully passing various motions, it also issued a declaration of the general meeting (full text recorded separately), see the first page, and sent telegrams to Acting President Li in Nanjing and Mr. Mao Zedong in Yan'an and all gentlemen of the Chinese Communist Party, calling for continued peace (telegram text attached). The conference announced its successful conclusion at 7:00 PM yesterday. The most important motion passed yesterday was the association's peace promotion opinion, which includes the following:

### Peace Promotion Opinion

Two Major Demands:

(1) Demand that both parties immediately cease fire on the spot and stop all mutually accusatory propaganda to show sincerity in seeking peace. (2) Demand that the CCP quickly send representatives to start talks with government representatives as soon as possible to seek comprehensive peace.

Seven Proposals:

(1) Peace should be based on equality and mutual understanding. (2) Convene a national peace conference with the participation of people's representatives; the signing of a peace agreement should have the participation of people's representatives. (3) Political democratization; economic socialization; military nationalization. (4) Guarantee of human rights and people's free way of life. (5) Referring to the established cases of the Political Consultative Conference, put forward opinions on amending the Constitution. (6) Both parties immediately open up freedom of the press and guarantee the freedom of action of journalists and peace advocates. (7) After the implementation of ceasefire and peace, immediately stop military service and conscription, and demobilize the army as much as possible and implement demobilization.

In addition to representatives from provincial and municipal councils and national professional groups, cultural groups, and women's groups, Wu Yuhao, Wu Zhesheng, Miao Diqing and other three representatives from the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation, who received the telegram from the National Peace Promotion Association the day before yesterday morning, specially flew to Shanghai yesterday afternoon and arrived at the meeting place at 4:30 PM. Due to time constraints, only Wu Yuhao reported (see later). Mayors of universities and vocational schools in the city, including Ling Xianyang, Ou Yuanhuai, Liao Shicheng, Zhao Xiuhong, Lu Xirong, Wang Yukai, Hu Yongyi, Wang Suichang, Situ Bo, and Xia Daming, were also invited to participate in the conference yesterday afternoon and were warmly welcomed by the conference. The proceedings of the two conferences yesterday are recorded separately as follows:

The third general meeting of the National Peace Promotion Association was held from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM yesterday, presided over by Zhou Xuexiang, Executive Director of the National Federation of Trade Unions, Wang Xiaoji, Chairman of the Business Federation, and Zhang Qiang, Speaker of the Zhejiang Provincial Council, who were jointly elected by the presidium of the conference. First, the presidium summarized the opinions of each person and asked the representatives to discuss the opinion on promoting peace at the conference item by item. As a result, it was resolved into two major demands and seven proposals.

### Revised Organizational Outline Passed; Directors to Be Assumed by the Presidium; First Meeting to Be Held Today

The fourth general meeting was held from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM yesterday, presided over by Wang Lu, Deputy Speaker of the Nanjing Municipal Council, Tang Siyao, Deputy Speaker of the Beiping Municipal Council, and Lu Xiaodao, Executive Director of the National Women's Groups Federation. First, the draft of the organizational outline of the National Peace Promotion Association was discussed and passed by the conference with amendments. The original text is as follows: (1) This association is named the National Peace Promotion Association. (2) The task of this association is to unite the forces of the people of the whole country, promote comprehensive peace, and complete national unity. (3) This association is organized by one to three representatives from the following public opinion organs and groups: (A) Councils (or temporary councils) of each province and municipality directly under the central government.

### Separate Telegrams to Both Parties Urging Peace

Then the conference passed a motion to send separate telegrams to Acting President Li and Mr. Mao Zedong, calling for peace. The telegrams read as follows: Nanjing, Respectful Greetings to President Li, Yan'an, Respectful Greetings to Mr. Mao Runzhi and Gentlemen of the Chinese Communist Party: Since the eight-year War of Resistance, the strength of the people has been exhausted. Continuing with three years of internal strife, lives have been devastated. The people are haggard and groaning, not knowing where they will die. With tears in our eyes, we earnestly seek peace. This association has specially gathered representatives from provincial and municipal councils and national professional groups, cultural groups, and women's groups to hold a national peace promotion conference in Shanghai, which opened on February 12. After the resolution of the conference, two major demands and seven proposals were put forward: (already seen above, omitted.) Recorded in the minutes. In addition to separate telegrams of appeal, we hereby telegraphically request: (1) Please adopt and implement it as soon as possible (for the telegram to President Li). (2) Supervise and follow, respectfully hoping that you will consider the overall situation, care about the plight of the people, grant adoption, quickly cease fire, and send representatives to start talks with government representatives as soon as possible to seek comprehensive peace (for the telegram to Mr. Mao). All representatives of the National Peace Promotion Association respectfully kowtow.

Closing Ceremony

Began at 6:30 PM. After the ceremony was performed as required, Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, served as chairman and read out the declaration of the conference. Liao Shicheng, acting president of Guanghua University, then made a brief speech on behalf of the university, stating: Recalling that since the establishment of the Republic of China, politics and military affairs have never been unified, causing the people to suffer. At present, peace is sought by everyone. We hope that both parties can seek it with the greatest sincerity, and they must take the will of the people as their will and the expectations of the people as their expectations. I hope that the National Peace Promotion Association will be successful so that the country and the nation can be prosperous and happy. The closing ceremony ended at about 7:00 PM.

### Nanjing Peace Delegation Arrives in Shanghai; Reports on Trip to the North

Wu Yujun, a representative of the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation, reported on the delegation's trip to the North, stating in brief: After arriving in Beiping, they were warmly received by the authorities. They rested on the first day, and the next afternoon, they were hosted at a banquet by the Joint Office. Seated with them were the mayor and deputy mayor of Beiping, as well as seven committee members. During the banquet, Mayor Ye Jianying spoke extensively, stating that if there were any peace negotiation proposals, they should first be clarified in writing so that preparations for explanations could be made. Starting at 7:00 PM on the 9th, General Ye Jianying spoke with us in batches until 2:00 AM. Unfortunately, many specific issues were evaded, stating that they had to be decided by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and that individuals could not make decisions. Regarding the issue of war criminals, I also expressed to Ye that the Chinese Communist Party was severely criticizing President Chiang Kai-shek, but I personally believed that President Chiang Kai-shek's "merits" outweighed his "faults" for China. Ye expressed agreement on this point, but also offered rebuttals.

### The Biggest Key to Peace Talks Lies in Eliminating Misunderstandings

Based on what I saw, I believe that the biggest key to peace talks lies in eliminating misunderstandings. Furthermore, the Communist Party has no extraordinary origins, so the current situation has evolved due to our own lack of competitiveness. However, I believe that the Communist side has not underestimated the government's strength, nor does it have a fixed intention to fight to the end.

### No More National Flags on the Streets

After Mr. Wu finished speaking, several representatives present at the meeting asked: (1) Why has the Chinese Communist Party not yet sent peace negotiation representatives? (2) After the Communist army entered Beiping, are national flags still seen on the streets? (3) Why did General Fu Zuoyi never meet with the delegation after all? (4) Why are news reporters not allowed to enter the city? Mr. Wu replied: (1) According to General Ye Jianying, the Chinese Communist Party wants to begin peace talks after Beiping is completely liberated. The so-called complete liberation likely refers to eliminating "Nationalist spies." They are currently actively investigating household registrations to prepare for this work. (2) National flags are no longer seen, and even the Kuomintang emblems on police hats have been removed. (3) The delegation originally intended to meet with General Fu, and we heard that General Fu had also agreed, but we never met after all, which is the biggest regret of this trip. (4) News reporters were not received because it is said that Beiping has only recently been "liberated," and everything has not yet returned to normal, so they hope that the press will postpone their visits.

### Qiu Zhizhong Issues a Statement

Qiu Zhizhong, a standing director of the China People's Peace Promotion Association, stated that the association had decided to relocate to Shanghai. He arrived here by car last night (the 14th). He met with reporters from this newspaper and informed them that there were many discrepancies in the news reports about the delegation in Beiping carried by Chinese and foreign newspapers, which had a significant impact. Therefore, corrections were issued. Now, seeing the Shanghai newspaper disseminating Mr. Wu's remarks, which seemed to have a tone of criticism, he felt compelled to offer a few more words of explanation: (1) When General Ye Jianying hosted us, Mr. Wu was barely speaking, so how could there be talk of private relations through direct telephone calls? (2) It only takes several people to deny a signature of one person, so why forge a seal? (3) Mr. Wu wanted to pay a visit to Acting President Li on the morning of the 14th, which contradicts the claim of a gathering at the Presidential Palace on the 12th and a summons at 3:00 PM on the 13th. (4) Whether Generals Lin Biao and Nie Rongzhen are in Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin) is questionable. Where did Mr. Wu see them? (5) The points Mr. Wu discussed with the Associated Press have a tone of disparagement and insult toward the Nationalist and Communist Parties, and he also deceived the compatriots in Jiangnan, which can be described as a slip of the tongue. (6) General Ye Jianying repeatedly explained to us that we must use the "Eight Articles" as the basis for negotiations, especially emphasizing the point of "reorganizing the army," and we heard no talk of concessions. (7) The Communist authorities adopted a purely explanatory attitude toward our delegation's call for peace. How could there be specific conditions to bring back and announce in a few days?

In short, the Peace Promotion Association was jointly formed by dozens of people's organizations and was originally intended to promote peace without fear of hardship, not to use it as a tool for speculation. Now, someone is arbitrarily publishing incorrect information, which affects the reputation of the organization, which is regrettable. If there are any more false statements or fabrications in the future, to save our time serving compatriots across the country, we will not waste our breath.

### 31 Citizens Petition for Bail for Arrested Children

[Report from this newspaper] Thirty-one citizens, including Huang Zhangshi, petitioned the National Peace Promotion Association yesterday to request bail for their arrested children.

### Young Man Benefits from Assistance from a Good Friend; Helps Him Find a Way to Study in the United States

[Report from this newspaper] In May of last year, a young man from this city, Xu Jingzhe, received assistance from the wealthy American automobile businessman Mr. and Mrs. Kirk to study in the United States. When Mr. and Mrs. Kirk were in China, they were close friends with Xu's father. Because their only son was killed in action during World War II, to leave a lasting memorial, they wrote to Xu, inviting him to study in the United States, and they would fund all expenses. This matter was reported in this newspaper and became a popular topic of conversation for a time. It is now learned that Xu is studying diligently in the United States, and because he has benefited himself, he is doing his best to help other young people in China also have the opportunity to go to the United States. His close friend Zhang Bang, a graduate of Dairen High School, also intends to study at Harding University. Xu helped him request funding from the school authorities, which has been approved. Both students are currently applying for passports from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and will soon be able to go to the United States to study with Xu.

### Rice Market Resumes Free Trade; Deadline for Rice Shops to Sell Rice is Extended; Violators Will Be Punished According to Three Measures

Mayor Wu, seeing that rice prices in the city have gradually stabilized recently and that deliveries have been enthusiastic, summoned representatives of rice merchants yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM and announced that the rice market would be allowed to resume free trade from the 15th, abolishing the current price limit of 4,500 yuan per shih, and also ceasing the sales policy. Regarding the issue of ordering each rice shop to sell on behalf of the government and ordering each rice shop to sell its own rice during the price limit period, according to Mr. Wu's statement to reporters, "During the price limit period, the government sold 15,000 shih, and each rice shop should also sell 15,000 shih. In other words, rice shops should hand in 300,000 copies of National Identity Card No. 5 and 300,000 copies of No. 6. Now, the deadline has been extended to the 18th. Rice shops that fail to comply by the deadline will be punished with three measures: (1) Revoking the business license of the rice shop. (2) Detaining the person in charge of the rice shop. (3) Sending police officers to sell the rice stored in the rice shop at the price limit.

### "Eating Flatbread to Satisfy Hunger is Now Considered Luxury" - The Plight of Public Education Personnel; Employees of Central Agencies in Shanghai Issue Declaration to Fight for Treatment

The Shanghai Central Government Agencies Employees' Association hosted a tea party for the press at the Customs Staff Training Center yesterday, presided over by the standing directors and employee representatives from various units. Representatives from units such as the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau, Goods Tax Bureau, Shanghai Audit Office of the Audit Department, and Industrial and Commercial Inspection Institute reported in succession that the current monthly income of a mid-level civil servant can only buy two dou of rice. They travel back and forth on foot every morning and evening. Those who eat flatbread and fried dough sticks for breakfast have become "luxurious guests." It has now been decided to submit a telegram to Acting President Li and Premier Sun of the Executive Yuan, requesting to follow the example of public officials in the capital and promptly issue family evacuation fees, employee contingency fees, and reasonable adjustments to treatment to ensure peace of mind for work. The two requirements listed in the association's declaration are recorded below:

(1) Family Evacuation Fees: Public officials and teachers in the capital had already evacuated their families in November of last year. Although there may be differences in urgency between Beijing and Shanghai, the situation is no different. Please follow the example of the capital, and base the family evacuation fees for civil servants in the capital on two months' salary, plus 1,000 yuan (which was equivalent to three months' salary at the time), and issue them according to the price index ratio at the time of payment so that they can evacuate their families and work with peace of mind.

(3) Employee Contingency Fees: Civil servants in the capital received contingency fees of three months' salary in January, plus 23,000 yuan (which was equivalent to thirteen months' salary for an appointed official). Please issue them according to the above base figure, according to the price index ratio at the time of payment, so that they can cope with emergencies.

The Shanghai Municipal Government has already issued 30 times the amount of the February salaries of the employees of various agencies under the municipal government on the 8th and 9th of this month, calculated according to the January standard.

### Bookstore Inspector Turns Out to Be a Robber; All People and Loot in Beihai Road Robbery Case Recovered Within Six Hours

[Report from this newspaper] The home of Xu Huifang at No. 221 Beihai Road was invaded by two robbers at 6:00 PM on the 8th, who stole three diamond rings and one single diamond ring and three diamond rings deposited by her girlfriend Ding Fuli. Du, the director of the Laozha Police Sub-bureau, ordered Zhang Kuidong, the chief of the Judicial Section, and his officers, including Sun Zhiming, to investigate.

### The National Bank Dumps Goods, Money Market Trends Tighten

[Report from our newspaper] The Central Bank has been dumping goods for days to stabilize prices.

The money market is tight, and the unofficial interest rate is very high. The daily interest rate in the morning was 70 yuan per 1,000 yuan.

### Overseas Remittance Income Declines

[Report from our newspaper]: Overseas remittances have been suspended from listing for half a month now. During this period, overseas remittances are calculated based on the market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates, but the market price of transfer certificates is often at a low level. Even in the last two days, although the market has suddenly improved, it is still about 30% lower than the black market price, so overseas remittance income has decreased. This year, the daily overseas remittance income is only about US$10,000, while last year, after the implementation of the listing method, the daily income reached more than US$50,000. Therefore, if we want to increase the number of overseas remittances, the fundamental method must focus on the exchange rate.

Gaobu indica rice was 8,000 yuan, and Yinbai yuan rice fell by about 1,000 yuan, but all rice was still not traded at the limited price.

Edible oil prices turned downward. As the money market continued to tighten, cargo owners were selling off, and retailers were hesitant to enter the market. With the prices of all non-industry commodities falling across the board, the market became even weaker, and prices generally fell by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan.

### Yarn and Cloth Stop Rising and Fall

Cotton yarn merchants were reluctant to sell, sales were sluggish, and market prices were unsustainable, fluctuating and declining. The morning opened with 42-count Yefeng yarn at 510,000 yuan, but with the tight money market, buyers were unable to make progress, transactions became cold, and the trend suddenly became weak, ending at 495,000 yuan, a drop of 15,000 yuan. 32-count Yin Yue yarn fell all the way from 380,000 yuan to 360,000 yuan at the close, a drop of 40,000 yuan. 21-count Shuangma spot yarn initially stood at the 300,000 yuan mark, once rising to 320,000 yuan in the middle, but finally fell back to 296,000 yuan, a drop of 24,000 yuan.

Other brands such as Jinxi and Jincheng also fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan each. All grades below 16-count were also sluggish.

Cotton cloth stopped rising and fell, because black and red were weakening, market sentiment was weak, and the money market was tight. Local customers had reached saturation and turned to a wait-and-see attitude. Merchants were eager to sell, and retailers were also less active, so the market turned flat and tired. Longtou fine cloth was initially quoted outside the market at 11,000 yuan, and rose again to 12,000 yuan at noon.

### Estimated Amount of Cotton in Stock in This City

[Report from our newspaper]: Since the war front is approaching day by day and the transportation lines are becoming narrower day by day, the supply of domestic cotton to the cotton mills in this city has virtually stopped. The largest source of foreign cotton supply, the US aid cotton of the Economic Cooperation Administration, has 300,000 bales that have been shipped to China in batches last year, and there are 100,000 bales remaining. The Economic Cooperation Administration has announced that it will stop shipping to China, which has a significant impact on the supply of raw cotton in this city. Moreover, due to the unstable situation, the foreign exchange earned by the yarn and cloth exported by the yarn mills in this city is used for ordering foreign cotton, and they all adopt a wait-and-see attitude.

According to the survey, the current stock of cotton in the city is estimated to be sufficient for the mills to operate for two months. The monthly consumption of raw cotton by the city's yarn mills (including the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai areas) is about 150,000 dan. The national yarn mills need about 250,000 dan of raw cotton.
