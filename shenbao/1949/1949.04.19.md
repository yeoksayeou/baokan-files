### The Negotiations Face a Showdown: Government to Decide Today, Firmly Rejecting the Communist Army's Demand to Cross the Yangtze River

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The peace negotiations have reached a critical stage, and the draft domestic peace agreement proposed by the Chinese Communists has caused unprecedented difficulties for the government. All day on the 18th, Acting President Li, Premier He, and other key officials held separate contacts to exchange opinions, which continued until after midnight. A general consensus has been reached, and it was decided that He Yingqin would invite the Acting President, Yu Youren, Tong Guanxian, Zhang Qun, Ju Zheng, Bai Chongxi, Zhu Jiahua, and others to hold an important meeting on the morning of the 19th to discuss and make a final decision on the government's response to the Chinese Communists. It is also reported that the government may issue a statement on the afternoon of the 19th to clarify its position. Based on the results of the exchange of opinions among key officials throughout the 18th, almost all believe that the eight articles and twenty-four clauses are actually terms of surrender. An authoritative official source stated: "The He Cabinet is a peace cabinet, and it is genuinely seeking peace. What the people need is true and fair peace, not peace through surrender." The official source's remarks included the possibility that the government would find it extremely difficult to accept such conditions.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The government will make a final decision on the Chinese Communists' demands at an important meeting to be held on the 19th, convened by He Yingqin. Ju Zheng, Wu Tiecheng, and Zhu Jiahua will also return to Shanghai from Xikou on the morning of the 19th, change planes, and fly to Nanjing to attend the important meeting. On the evening of the 18th, official sources attached great importance to the meeting, believing that it would be key to determining whether the area south of the Yangtze River would be surrendered.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Among the Chinese Communists' eight articles and twenty-four clauses, the demand that the Communist army cross the Yangtze River from eight strongholds after the signing of the peace agreement, station troops in major cities, and supervise the reorganization of the army has become the most difficult issue in the negotiations. As a result of the exchange of opinions among government officials over the past two days, the 17th and 18th, it is generally considered unacceptable. The meeting convened by He Yingqin on the 19th will further discuss this matter. According to well-informed sources on the evening of the 18th, the government has decided to reject the Chinese Communists' demand for the Communist army to cross the Yangtze River. However, the manner in which the government will express its rejection will be discussed at the meeting on the 19th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Huang Shaohong went to the Central Hospital on the 18th for a medical examination. His return to Beiping is undecided and will reportedly be determined at the meeting on the 19th.

### Content of the Ten Most Important of the Twenty-Four Clauses Proposed by the Chinese Communists; Acting President Li Denies Sending a Telegram to Mao Zedong

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] A local evening newspaper reported on the 18th that Acting President Li sent a telegram to Mao Zedong on the morning of the 18th, requesting an extension of the signing date of the peace agreement proposed by the Chinese Communists. On the evening of the 18th, a government spokesperson officially denied this. It was stated that Acting President Li did not send a telegram to Mao Zedong on the 18th requesting an extension.

### Wu Tiecheng Returns to Nanjing

[Our Dispatch] Wu Tiecheng arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 16th and went to eastern Zhejiang the next morning to visit Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in Fenghua. He did not meet with Huang Shaohong before his departure, nor did he learn the full text of the twenty-four clauses proposed by the Chinese Communists. Wu Tiecheng returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the night train of the 18th.

### Third-Party Figures' Trip to Beiping Undecided

[Our Dispatch] As of last night, the number of people and the departure date for the third party's trip to Beiping at the invitation of the Chinese Communists have not been determined. According to Luo Longji, he only learned about this matter from the newspapers, and the government has not yet sent anyone to discuss it in person. He plans to consider it further after clarifying the situation. Zhang Lan's opinion is the same as his.

### Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee Rejects the Proposal to Simplify the Organization of the Examination Yuan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee reviewed the proposal by Zhou Jieren and others to "revise the Organic Law of the Examination Yuan, abolish the Ministry of Examinations, and have its business directly handled by the Examination Yuan, and reduce the Ministry of Personnel to a Personnel Department to simplify and save public funds." Tian Jiongjin, Minister of Examinations, attended the meeting to report. The committee members spoke one after another, believing that combining examination and personnel administration was unreasonable, and that the Examination Yuan having two ministries under it was not too large and should not be abolished. Most advocated retaining the original proposal, and the result of the vote was to reject it.

### Joint Meeting of Two Committees of the Legislative Yuan Reviews the Internal Organization Law; Li Han-hun Attends and Reports

### Kuomintang Central Executive Committee Issues a Statement on the Current Peace Negotiations: National Independence and Freedom Are Not to Be Changed

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th] The Kuomintang Central Executive Committee issued a statement on the current peace negotiations on the 18th. The full text is as follows:

"In January of this year, President Chiang issued a proclamation, willing to re-discuss with the Chinese Communist Party the cessation of war and the restoration of peace, and revealed specific methods for peace. As long as the peace agreement does not harm the independence and integrity of the country, and helps the people recuperate, as long as the sacred Constitution is not violated, democracy is not undermined, the national system of the Republic of China can be ensured, the legal system of the Republic of China will not be interrupted, the army has real protection, and the people can maintain their free lives and current minimum living standards, then individual advances, retreats, and positions will not be taken to heart, and all the public opinion of the people will be followed. His painstaking efforts to plan for the country and his open attitude have aroused a unanimous response throughout the country.

On January 21 of this year, President Chiang, in order to achieve the goal of eliminating war, resolutely issued a statement, deciding to take the lead in retiring and, in accordance with the Constitution, Vice President Li would act as President. He hoped that the military and civilians throughout the country and governments at all levels would unite and assist Acting President Li in working together to promote lasting peace. At the same time, he reiterated his advocacy of saving the people from fire and water, preserving the nation's vitality, ensuring the integrity of territory and sovereignty, preventing the destruction of history, culture, and social order, and ensuring the people's lives, freedoms, and rights.

President Chiang is the Director-General of our party. The above two proclamations were issued after obtaining unanimous agreement from the Central Committee of our party. The consistent aim of the Founder of our Party is to realize the Three Principles of the People in order to establish a solid foundation for the country and seek world peace. President Chiang's advocacy truly represents the traditional spirit of sacrifice and loyalty to the country for the past fifty years. Therefore, all comrades of our party are working together to support this advocacy.

Relying on the Public Opinion of the People and the Party to Support Acting President and Premier He

Since Acting President Li assumed the duties of President, he has actively engaged in seeking a path to peace negotiations with the spirit of enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens, based on the inspiration of the above two proclamations. Ultimately, relying on the urging of public opinion and the support of national discourse, both sides' representatives were able to begin peace negotiations in Beiping on the first of this month. From then on, a glimmer of peace began to appear, and domestic compatriots and friendly countries around the world unanimously focused their attention on the results of these peace negotiations as a key to the importance of the governance and security of China and the world.

During the peace negotiations, the most regrettable or obstructive factor was the smog of rumors. These rumors are largely due to the arduousness of the peace negotiations, and those responsible for the peace negotiations have a cautious and fearful attitude, unwilling to disclose information casually. In order to remove obstacles to the peace negotiations, our party will once again state its consistent position on the peace negotiations in order to correct the views of China and foreign countries.

First, we want to make it clear to the people of the country that the tasks currently shouldered by Acting President Li and Premier He are based on the Constitution of the Republic of China, and their tasks to our party are to implement the decisions of the party. What Acting President Li and Premier He rely on to negotiate peace with the Communist Party is the public opinion of the people and our party. The people and our party support Acting President Li and Premier He based on their advocacy of peace negotiations. Therefore, the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of our party made a resolution on peace negotiations on the seventh of this month, with five principles:

Five Principles for Sincere Peace Seeking, Maintaining the Spirit of Independence and Autonomy

(1) In order to show sincerity in seeking peace and demonstrate credibility to the people, both sides should immediately order a ceasefire and have their troops remain in their original defenses at the beginning of the peace negotiations.

If the Communist army crosses the Yangtze River during the peace negotiations, it will indicate that they have no sincerity in seeking peace. The government should immediately recall its representatives and declare that the responsibility for the breakdown of the peace negotiations lies with the Communist Party.

(2) In order to maintain the spirit of national independence and autonomy and fulfill the responsibilities entrusted by the United Nations Charter, foreign policies aimed at promoting international cooperation and maintaining world peace should be maintained.

(3) In order to effectively safeguard the people's free way of life, all policies of using violence should be stopped, and the people's freedoms, rights, and property should be protected by law.

(4) The armies of both sides should reorganize themselves in their respective defense zones under equal conditions. The reorganization plan must have guarantees that both sides respect each other and implement them simultaneously.

(5) The organizational form and composition of the government should ensure the implementation of the above-mentioned principles 2, 3, and 4.

On the 14th of this month, the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of our party made a supplementary resolution on the fifth of the above-mentioned peace negotiation principles. The resolution stated that before the constitutional amendment procedures are signed, both sides should agree to demarcate jurisdictional areas and engage in peaceful construction separately. After the Constitution is amended, the government should be organized in accordance with the Constitution.

This is the position of our party on the current peace negotiations. It is hereby issued to clear up social confusion.

Our party believes that the outcome of the peace negotiations is of great importance to the future of the nation and the people. No political party can weigh it solely based on the rights and interests of its own party. On the contrary, those who do so will be spurned by the people of the whole country. Since the founding of our party by the Founder of the Nation, its permanent belief has been the Three Principles of the People, and its ultimate goal is to seek national and people's welfare and lasting world peace. The struggle for more than fifty years, through all kinds of hardships, has not deviated from this goal. What our party seeks is only to ensure the survival of the nation and the people and the realization of the Three Principles of the People. It has never had the idea of monopolizing national power by one party. If the nation, the people, and the Three Principles of the People cannot be ensured, then sacrifice and struggle to fulfill its divine duty to save the country and the people will be worth dying for, without complaint. This is our party's inescapable responsibility to the history of the Republic of China. If it is not done in this way, it will be a traitor to the Founder of the Nation and a criminal to the martyrs. This heart is clear and can be questioned by the world. Now that our party has led the War of Resistance to success, the country's vitality is greatly damaged, and the people's livelihood is difficult. They all hope to recuperate. We should strive to promote the implementation of the Three Principles of the People by peaceful means. What our party comrades are fighting for is only the advocacy of national affairs, and we will never care about the rights of parties or individuals. What we hope that the Communist Party members should understand is that the details of the peace negotiation conditions should be carefully drafted by the representatives of both sides with great patience, so that they are feasible and must be implemented. No matter what, there are things that cannot be done hastily, such as the name of the Republic of China must not be changed, the basic freedoms and rights of the people granted by the Constitution must not be deprived, the integrity and independence of national sovereignty must not be harmed, so that the Chinese nation becomes cannon fodder for others, and the reform of the social economy must not be carried out by violent means, so that a moribund society replays the tragedy of liquidation. All these minimum limits are clearly and obviously stated to the whole country. People have the same heart, and the criteria for national affairs are based on this. If this limit is exceeded, not only will there be no way to face the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in creating the Republic of China, eliminating warlords, and resisting Japanese invaders, but also our 450 million compatriots will be plunged into an abyss from which they can never escape. Not only our party should not remain silent, but also the compatriots of the whole country must have a collective expression of justice. The Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang."

### Proposal to Reasonably Adjust the Treatment of Public School Teachers and Civil Servants to Be Submitted to the Legislative Yuan for Discussion Today; The Establishment of the Military Expenditure Budget Has Also Been Included on the Agenda

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] At the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 19th, the following will be discussed: the draft Organic Law of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; the proposal to reasonably adjust the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants; the proposal to abolish and merge military organs, strictly prohibit vacancies in the army, establish the military expenditure budget, increase the treatment of soldiers, and ensure actual expenditures; the proposal to establish special articles to sanction market monopolies, so as to avoid unreasonable price fluctuations and stabilize people's livelihoods; and the proposal to request the government to protect industries throughout the country and prevent damage from war, so as to maintain national vitality and facilitate production.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The National Defense Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting on the afternoon of the 18th, chaired by Zhang Zhijiang. They reviewed the administrative guidelines of the Executive Yuan and the military-related parts of the political reform outline proposed by committee members Zou Shuwen and Tang Jiyao. The committee members spoke enthusiastically, generally believing that current military expenditures were huge and the treatment of the national army was very poor. This was actually due to the large number of personnel attached to the army. In the future, a policy of elite troops should be adopted, salaries should be paid in full, non-combatant personnel in the army should be reduced as much as possible, and military expenditures must be gradually reduced to the lowest possible level. The budget should not exceed 50% of the total budget. The revised draft prepared by the seven-member group elected at the previous meeting was passed item by item and will be submitted to the next meeting of the Yuan for discussion.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Finance and Banking Committee and the Legal System Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a joint meeting on the morning of the 18th to review Wang Lihang's proposal to "reform the national financial institutions," Wu Shiheng's proposal to "reform the banking system," and Zhang Jingyu's proposal to "revise the Organic Law of the Central Bank." Zhang Jingyu, the chairman, first explained the significance of reforming the Central Bank and other financial institutions, and put forward a written opinion on the legislative principles for revising the Organic Law of the Central Bank. Wang Lihang believes that the bureaucratic habits of the Central Bank must be thoroughly reformed, and a supervisory and review committee should be established with the participation of people's representatives. Personnel should also be reorganized, and it is advocated that state-owned banks and financial institutions should be nationalized, unified, socialized, and democratized in the future. The proposal to abolish commercial banks was then discussed. The committee members generally believed that commercial banks had many drawbacks, but due to constitutional provisions, it was inconvenient to abolish them. However, they should be strictly managed in the future and their units should be reduced as much as possible. At the afternoon meeting, the committee members advocated that, except for the name of the Central Bank, which should be retained, the Bank of China should be merged with the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China should be merged with the Cooperative Bank. As for whether to retain two or three state-owned banks, the number of committee members present did not meet the legal quorum. The matter was left for discussion at the next meeting.

### A Subcommittee Decides on Eight Principles for Issuing Special Public Bonds

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Regarding the "issuance of special relief public bonds" proposed by Legislative Yuan member Yang Baodong and others, the review subcommittee of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting on the afternoon of the 18th and passed eight principles: (1) The name of the public bond is set as special public bonds, and its purpose is to subsidize the balance of the national budget; (2) The amount of the public bond is set at 2 million taels of gold; (3) The public bond is compulsorily allocated to wealthy households and merchants in large cities with a population of more than 100,000. Those who voluntarily subscribe will be given preferential rewards; (4) The public bond is interest-free, and repayment will begin after three years, with the bond being cleared in five years; (5) The public bond can be used to offset property taxes; (6) If those assigned to subscribe do not pay, the government may sell their property to offset it; (7) In addition to gold, the public bond can be paid in foreign currency, silver, silver dollars, or gold yuan coupons converted at market prices, and the government will repay in the same way; (8) The issuance of public bonds should be as fast as possible. The above review opinions will be discussed at a meeting of the Finance and Banking Committee before being reported to the Yuan meeting.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The fierce fighting in Taiyuan has increased unabated. The invading Communist army has increased to twelve regiments and an artillery division. The fighting on the 18th was fiercest in the east and northwest of the city. In the east, the Communist army, under the cover of artillery, launched a fierce attack on the national army positions in the direction of Sanershu throughout the day, but were repelled. In the northwest, the Communist army, with a force of one division, under the cover of more than twenty artillery pieces in the mountains, attacked strongholds such as Wu Jiabao and Nanbeiyin, about forty li from the city. One fortress of the national army was captured due to excessive shelling and fire. There were no other changes.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Taiyuan pacification director Yan Xishan moved from the Capital Hotel to the Lishi Society Guest House at No. 6 Yihe Road on the morning of the 18th.

The amount of food being airdropped to Taiyuan has now decreased compared to before, with only about twenty planes transporting food each day.

Also, Tang Enbo, Huang Xuchu, Tong Guanxian, and others paid visits one after another.

### The Situation North of the Yangtze River Increasingly Urgent; Communist Army Vows to Cross the River Before the 25th; Yong'anzhou Southeast of the Port Captured

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 18th] The Communist army of Chen Yi and Su Yu north of the Yangtze River has been continuously attacking several bridgehead positions of the Nationalist army on the north bank, such as Shierxu and Tuqiao (southwest of Yangzhou), and Yuxikou (opposite Wuhu). At the same time, they have also declared that they will launch a large-scale crossing of the Yangtze River before the 25th with three army corps. According to reports, they will use Gaoqiao (opposite Taigang, east of Zhenjiang), Yong'anzhou (south of the port), and Tiexin, Peiwen, and Shangguan islands in the middle of the river near Anqing as springboards for advancing south of the Yangtze River. The Nationalist army is on high alert. Furthermore, the Communist army has recently dug up and destroyed the original embankments in various low-lying areas on the north bank of the Yangtze River. According to aerial reconnaissance reports over the past two days, the most extensive damage is to the embankments from Tuqiao opposite Tongling in central Anhui, through Liujiadu to Wuwei, and from Wuwei southeast to Yaojiawan, totaling over a hundred li in length. The remaining scattered excavations have not yet been listed. According to reports, the Communist army's digging is intended to raise the water level during floods, divert water into the fields, and facilitate the entry of boats, thereby facilitating their attack on the south of the Yangtze River. They disregard the farmers' livelihoods and crops, causing the farmers in these areas to lament endlessly.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 18th] From the night of the 17th, the Communist army's 34th Army of the Chen Yi's faction attacked the Nationalist army's bridgehead strongholds Shierxu and Tuqiao, northwest of Zhenjiang, opposite the river. After the Nationalist army, led by Wang Zuohua, with the assistance of the navy, made every effort to resist, fierce fighting continued until the evening of the 18th. Furthermore, Yong'anzhou, southeast of the port, was attacked on the night of the 17th by two regiments of Chen Yi's 27th Army, who took advantage of the heavy fog and artillery cover to land from Longxiaogang, Madian, and Longwo, north of Taiyu. After the Nationalist army inflicted heavy casualties on them in Shangqiao, Laowei, and Shiwuxu, they were eventually forced to retreat under the cover of the air force and navy after dawn on the 18th due to the disparity in numbers. As for Beishazhou, south of Yong'anzhou, aerial reconnaissance reports this afternoon indicated that the Communist army that landed on Yong'anzhou had increased to one division. A large number of ships were also gathered in the Sanjiangying, Gaoqiao, Kou'an, and Xingang areas. Over twenty ships were sunk. In the Sanjiangying area, over 500 Communist soldiers crossed the river to invade Xinbaizhen, northwest of Yangzhong, but were completely repelled by the defending troops.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch on the 18th] Parts of the Communist army's 20th and 23rd Armies launched attacks on the Nationalist army's positions in Yong'anzhou (northeast of Zhenjiang, across the river) from Sima Town and Ximadian in two routes on the night of the 17th. Currently, the Nationalist army has partially retreated to Maoshan.

[Our Wuhu Dispatch on the 18th] Recently, over a thousand local communists, carrying over 800 rifles and over ten machine guns, were suddenly discovered in the Mujiating Shizishan Chishazhou area (bordering Fanchang County) in the northwest of Nanling, attempting to seize Nationalist army positions along the Yangtze River when necessary, establish bridgeheads, and welcome the crossing of the Yangtze River by the Communist army from the north bank. The Nationalist army has now dispatched troops to encircle and suppress them.

[Our Wuhu Dispatch on the 18th] There were only minor skirmishes in the suburbs of Anqing on the 18th. However, a large number of Communist troops have recently gathered on the islands of Tiexin, Shangguan, and Peiwen, south of Shankouzhen, west of Anqing, declaring that they will concentrate three army corps, approximately 100,000 men, to cross the Yangtze River in a large-scale operation before the 25th. The 16th Army of Chen Geng's faction, with two divisions, will be in the first line, with the remainder in the second line. The Communist army is currently strengthening fortifications on various islands and setting up artillery positions along the riverbank. Their headquarters are located in Hongjiapu, approximately 30 kilometers west of Anqing.

[Our Hengdian Dispatch on the 18th] Military sources: The Communist army in the Huangmei and Guangji area of eastern Hubei is now actively preparing to cross the Yangtze River. They have already printed various maps of the areas along the river in southern Hubei, and have conducted particularly detailed surveys of the terrain around Wuhan. Furthermore, Chen Geng's faction has also established a Yangtze River crossing training class in Huangchuan, southern Henan. The main courses are practicing swimming and rowing. The Communist soldiers in training must take turns practicing in the Huai River every day. According to reports from returned prisoners, the Communist army in eastern Hubei and the Dabie Mountains area numbers approximately three armies, totaling less than 100,000 men, including local communists on the border of Henan and Anhui. (2) Over a thousand Communist soldiers west of the Pinghan Railway attempted to attack Xiaogan last night. After being intercepted by local militia forces ten li from the city, they immediately retreated.

[Our Hankou Dispatch on the 18th] During the lull in the fighting on various fronts, many generals who had come to Hankou have recently left Hankou one after another to return to their defense posts.

Editorial

### The Test of Whether to Surrender

The Chinese Communist Party's attitude towards peace talks was revealed in its entirety the day before yesterday. In a nutshell, it is to order the National Government in Nanjing to surrender unconditionally.

The current question is simply: Are the civil and military officials of the National Government, from Acting President Li down, willing to meekly obey orders and instruct their peace representatives to sign the surrender agreement? In essence, it is making the National Government face the test of whether to surrender.

No one does not desire peace; no one wants to continue or expand the war. However, to have the National Government sign a surrender agreement without the consent of the people, forcing all 450 million people of China into the Iron Curtain to become slaves of the Communist Party and cannon fodder for the Soviet Union, is highly questionable whether people are willing and eager for such a thing. Those who unconditionally echo and American friends who are scratching an itch from afar seem to be right in saying that the Chinese people are tired of war, but they have overlooked one point: that the Chinese people are particularly averse to being controlled by the Communist Party and fighting for the Soviet Union. Rather than surrendering for the sake of temporary peace and being forced to fight for the Soviet Union in the future, we believe that the Chinese people would rather not have this temporary peace.

Mao Zedong, representing the Chinese Communist Party, broadcasted on January 12 in the posture of a victor, putting forward the so-called eight conditions, namely (1) punish war criminals, (2) abolish the constitution, (3) abolish the legal system, (4) reorganize government troops, (5) confiscate bureaucratic capital, (6) reform the land system, (7) abolish traitorous treaties, and (8) establish a democratic coalition government. This was originally a response to the five principles mentioned by President Chiang in his New Year's message. On January 27, Acting President Li, without going through the decision of the Executive Yuan, suddenly telegraphed Mao, saying that "the government has recognized that these eight conditions can be used as the basis for peace talks." As a result, the atmosphere of peace talks suddenly became hot and cold. After many twists and turns, the CCP finally delivered the so-called "Revised Draft Agreement" of eight articles and twenty-four clauses to the Nanjing delegation on the 15th of this month, and set a deadline of the 20th of this month for signing. Huang Shaohong, this enthusiastic peace talk representative, spared no effort to fly back to Nanjing for instructions. At the same time, the CCP suddenly broadcasted in Beiping, announcing the process of the peace talks, but the so-called "Nanjing delegation" and the National Government in Nanjing dared not reveal the contents of this ultimatum of eight articles and twenty-four clauses until 6:00 p.m. yesterday, deeply fearing that unilateral disclosure would offend the CCP.

However, from what Chinese and foreign reporters have learned from various sources, the harshness of the CCP's conditions is unimaginable. For example, (1) overthrow the constitution, (2) change the name and flag of the country, (3) abolish the Six Codes, (4) dissolve the National Assembly and the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans, (5) all levels of government, central and local, will be taken over by the coalition government (anti-communists in the Kuomintang will of course have no part), (6) the chairman and members of the highest decision-making committee of the coalition government will be selected by the CCP, (7) government military forces will be reorganized in accordance with the Beiping reorganization method, (8) the Communist army will "peacefully cross the Yangtze River" in Jiangyin, Zhenjiang, Wuhu, Anqing, and Jiujiang to supervise the reorganization of the troops, (9) the navy and air force should be handed over within a time limit, (10) in addition to confiscating the property of the four major families, all places with active funds of more than 10,000 silver dollars should be confiscated at different levels and in proportion, (11) the land of all large and middle landlords should be liquidated, (12) all treaties and agreements between China and the United States should be regarded as traitorous treaties and should be repealed, and (13) the United States "should return all rights and interests that have been historically infringed upon in China to the United Government of China," etc., are all important clauses. In addition, there are two additional clauses: (1) the Communist army must be stationed in ten places, including Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Changsha, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, and Kunming, and (2) President Chiang must leave the country immediately. After reading these clauses, most people believe that the arrogance of the CCP is so great that it cannot be compared with the attitude of the government at the Political Consultative Conference when the CCP was propagandaed to be oppressed by the government.

We believe that under the major premise of sincerely seeking peace, what the National Government in Nanjing should consider is not the issue of war criminals, nor should it be the issue of President Chiang's personal residence, but should focus on how the people will suffer in the future and what the country's future situation will be. In other words, do the people have freedom, and can the country be independent? If the above two key elements are sacrificed in order to accept these conditions, then it is surrender. This surrender, although it may allow for temporary (?) peace, will ultimately plunge China into the Iron Curtain and cause the Chinese people to suffer greater war disasters in future world wars.

The "Republic of China" and the "Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth" national flag, which were formed by the blood of countless martyrs and compatriots who have flowed through more than 30 years of revolution and resistance, are now to be wiped out with a single stroke. The Japanese and Wang Jingwei and others did not dare to completely fabricate this, but now they are actually trying to do it. This indicates, on the one hand, that it is full of feudal ideas of "changing dynasties," and on the other hand, that it must follow the Soviet Union step by step. Moreover, a coalition government chaired by CCP personnel and manipulated by the CCP will inevitably implement the statement they broadcasted on the 3rd of this month, "Unite the people of the whole country... and join hands with China's ally, the Soviet Union, to defeat the invaders." Then, the future of China, in addition to being dragged into the "sickle and hammer" group by the CCP, making the people of the whole country cannon fodder for the Soviet Union, will have no other path. Compatriots, please think about it: Under such a coalition government, can China still be considered an independent country? Can China still have "true peace"? No wonder all treaties and agreements between China and the United States should be abolished, while the Sino-Soviet Treaty, which ceded Outer Mongolia and the rights and interests in Northeast China, is regarded as sacred and inviolable, and not a word is mentioned!

Furthermore, the old laws are abolished before the new laws are promulgated, and the civil, criminal, and commercial laws are all thrown into the toilet, making China a "country without laws" in name and in reality, not to mention the constitution. The National Assembly, the source of political power, and the legislative and supervisory agencies are all dissolved. We do not know who will dissolve them. Is it Acting President Li? Acting President Li himself was elected by the National Assembly. What power does he have to dissolve the National Assembly? What power does he have to amend the constitution? If the name is not correct, then the words will not be smooth. In addition to revolutionizing himself, Acting President Li has no authority to do these things. With all laws abolished, the freedom of the people and the inherent human rights are naturally completely unprotected. The liquidation and confiscation of property goes without saying. How can many people who used to tout democracy and freedom still protect their freedom under a government without laws? The compatriots who "fled south" from the Communist areas in Northeast China, North China, Northern Jiangsu, and Northern Anhui, including intellectuals, business people, and even distressed farmers, all say that in those places, the CCP leaders "say and follow the law" (because there is no law, so their words are the law), which has made people lose all "interest in life" and have the spirit of "if you hear the Tao (the Communist Tao) in the morning, you can die in the evening." "When will you perish? I will perish with you." This is the unspeakable mood of the people in the Communist areas today. If the Communist army crosses the Yangtze River and controls all of China, no matter what their rural policies are or what their urban policies are, it is certain that the people will lose all freedom. Many people who now consider learning to twist the Yangge dance fashionable and who echo and criticize the Kuomintang and the National Government as "progressing" will not be able to breathe the air of freedom at that time, or they may not be able to regret it.

Therefore, the country's situation today is very simple, and can be decided in one word. Those who run the government, if they are great statesmen, should consider the long-term interests of the people and the country, and decide on this one word. Then what is this "one word decision"? It is: when the CCP is unwilling to withdraw its excessive demands of eight articles and twenty-four clauses and insists on crossing the Yangtze River, the government and the people only have to choose between "surrender" and "war," and there is no such thing as "peace." Unless blessed by the heavens, the CCP changes its attitude and calmly renegotiates, the government can continue its peace talks. In the next two days, the government is indeed facing the test of whether to surrender, and what will our people do?

### The Northeast After the "Eastern Iron Curtain": Eating Has "Class" Distinctions – Small Stove, Medium Stove, Large Stove; Residents Cannot Travel Beyond a Hundred Li, No Freedom of Speech

[Report from this newspaper] Hu Yucai, Deputy Manager of the Shenyang Branch of the Central Bank, Shen Muqian, Chief of the Issuance Department, Zhou Zhenhao, and others, departed Shenyang successively after its capture. Zhou Zhenhao left Shenyang for Ping on February 11th, a journey that lasted more than twenty days. They arrived in Qingdao on the 14th and spoke at length with a reporter from this newspaper, allowing a glimpse into the recent conditions of the Northeast after the Eastern Iron Curtain. The valuable information regarding economic life is worthy of reference by all parties. The content of their conversation is as follows:

Mr. Zhou described the hardships he experienced leaving Panjin. The Communists issued travel passes. Captured Nationalist soldiers were issued "Liberation Certificates." Production personnel in Communist organizations (i.e., those engaged in business) could travel with "Production Travel Passes." Aside from these, ordinary people had absolutely no freedom of movement. From the Communist army's entry into the city on November 2nd of last year until February 11th, the travel passes they issued did not allow travel beyond one hundred and twenty li from Panjin. People who obtained travel passes had to have them stamped by the Communist army's law enforcement team at the train station before being allowed to buy tickets. However, automobile drivers did not need to carry travel passes. Mr. Zhou managed to obtain a driver's position and drove a 1939 Ford truck out of Shenyang on February 11th. It is said that after the Shenyang branch of the Central Bank was renamed the Northeast Bank branch, Central Bank personnel were given five to fifteen days to report. Those willing to stay were promised their original positions and salaries. Those unwilling to stay also had to complete the handover. Those who engaged in destructive acts without orders from the Nationalist government would be punished. At that time, the Communist takeover work was so chaotic it was beyond description. Therefore, they used all sorts of tricks to retain old personnel. Trainees from the Harbin Bank training class arrived successively. Their cultural level was extremely low; they were full of terms but did not understand their meaning, creating endless jokes. The majority of them probably only had a primary school education and did not know many Chinese characters. At that time, the exchange rate for Northeast circulating currency was 300,000 to 1.0, and the exchange had to be completed within one week. Later, they claimed that the Military Control Commission had not yet been established, and those who wished to resign still could not leave. Immediately, they began forced training to change their thinking. Every day, from 6:30 to 7:30 AM, they sang songs. At 8:00 AM, they ate. From 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, they studied (or held small group meetings). From 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, they had discussion sessions. At 3:00 PM, they ate again. After repeated requests to honor their promises, most personnel finally received "Departure Certificates" on December 19th. Just as they were about to set out to the south, they were detained by the Public Security Bureau. Obtaining a travel pass was almost as difficult as ascending to heaven.

Within the Northeast Bank, food was divided into three grades (the meaning of this "grade" is not the class in Communist theory but the salary grade of the Communist Party, which is also the lifestyle promoted by the Communist Party). The same was true in other organizations. It was divided into small stove, medium stove, and large stove. The small stove was called health-care meals, enjoyed by the bank's general manager, Cao Juru, deputy general manager, Huang Qizhi, and section chiefs. Each table had four dishes (three meat and one vegetable) and one soup, with chicken, fish, and meat, and they ate rice, which was extremely lavish, incomparable to the government and banking sectors. The medium stove was much worse, used by the bank's section heads and former Central Bank personnel from deputy director upwards to deputy manager. It had two dishes (one meat and one vegetable, the so-called meat dish containing about two or three taels of meat at most) and one soup, with six people per table, two meals a day, one meal of sorghum and one meal of rice. As for the large stove, both meals were sorghum, and each meal was white cabbage and tofu soup, sometimes with vermicelli, called "standard dish," with no changes at all. It was used by former personnel below the deputy director level and ordinary colleagues, with no special meals or treats. The Communist Party's treatment was that its high-ranking personnel were on a supply system and did not need to submit expense reports. The Central Bank's three cars were used very frequently by them, consuming much more gasoline than in the Central Bank era. For example, the general manager, Cao Juru, had an old nanny in his home, but she was renamed "babysitter." According to the Communist Party's so-called new lifestyle and theory, Mrs. Cao had to serve the people, and the "babysitter" would take care of her children at home. It seems that in principle, each child should have one "babysitter." Since General Manager Cao had four or five children, he also needed the same number of "babysitters." This was in fact how it was done. However, such measures did not seem to be stipulated in the Communist Party's various pamphlets.

Their consumption of gasoline (left over from the past government) seemed unlimited, and they did not cherish it, which was surprising. At the beginning of this year, Soviet gasoline began to appear. It was estimated to be less than 70 octane, with extremely weak explosive power, a foul odor, and thick smoke. With one gallon of American gasoline, the 1939 Ford could travel twelve kilometers. With the red Soviet oil used by Mr. Zhou (seen in the rear during the War of Resistance), it could only travel six kilometers. The road surface was also slightly related. Under the worst road conditions, it sometimes only traveled eight li.

The only business of the Northeast Bank was as a public treasury. It had no accounting regulations and no business policy decisions. The Northeast was completely closed off in terms of finance, independent as a group, with no business contact with the People's Bank, and no exchange of currency. Northeast banknotes circulated up to Shanhaiguan, and People's banknotes circulated up to Qinhuangdao. Initially, it was set at 10 yuan of People's banknotes to 10,000 yuan of Northeast banknotes. Later, the exchange rate between Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao gradually changed, and People's banknotes had to be discounted. It has now fallen below 60%, that is, 10 yuan of People's banknotes can only be exchanged for more than 5,000 yuan of Northeast banknotes. Relatively speaking, Northeast banknotes are more stable. The cost of living in Beiping is appropriately twice as high as in Shenyang. The Northeast Bank opened the Dongxiang Gold Store in Shenyang. Although gold was freely traded, it was a monopoly and also sold jewelry. People were allowed to hold gold. The US dollar had no significant relationship to the Northeast banknote. On one occasion, US Vice Consul Hu Baode contacted them about this matter. At that time, it was temporarily decided to use gold as the standard, at 35 US dollars per tael, and then converted into Northeast banknotes.

Regarding transactions with the Soviet Union, according to direct information obtained, the Shenyang International Trade Company was established in early February, located opposite the South Railway Station, and was headed by purely Chinese merchants, supported by the Soviets. Its only export was food, and Soviet goods were crude industrial products, including colored cotton cloth and machine screw parts as the two major items. According to extremely reliable news from someone from Harbin, the transactions in northern Manchuria involved exchanging grain for military supplies (all "war booty" of the Soviet Union in the Northeast), with some machinery as well.

Comparing the three kinds of materials—gold, coal, and sorghum—in early November, gold was 45,000 yuan of Northeast banknotes per tael, coal was 60,000 yuan per ton, and sorghum was 2,500 yuan per jin. In early February, gold was 110,000 yuan per tael, coal had already soared to 120,000 yuan in December, which was related to the season, and sorghum was 6,000 yuan per jin in early February, an increase rate equal to that of gold. Soybeans had no market at all, with no trace of soybeans to be seen. North Korean merchants also came to Shenyang to exchange for grain, bringing mostly American lighters and other light goods brought in from South Korea, which shows that the Soviet Union and North Korea must have needed Northeastern grain.

### Cheng Qian Writes to Chen Quzhen, Hoping He Will Come Out of Retirement to Clean Up the Current Situation in Western Hunan; Local Militia in Baojing Recapture the County Seat

[Report from this newspaper, Changsha, 18th] Chairman Cheng recently sent a handwritten letter of over a thousand words to Chen Quzhen of Fenghuang, expressing his sincere intentions, hoping that Chen would come out of retirement to clean up the current situation in western Hunan, and expressed his willingness to listen to Chen's opinions as the basis for the government's future resolution of the Hunan problem.

However, the "heroes" gathered in Wangcun, planning to bypass Yuanling to the north and attack Cili and Taoyuan in the east, joining forces in Changde. The rebel army's only concern was that Qu Bogai's troops in Dayong had not been able to reach a compromise, so they did not dare to attack Changtao rashly. The government army has now attached importance to the defense of Citao, and a unit of the National Army in Yuan is stationed in Taoyuan.

### Bandits in Yunnan Province Expand Towards Western Yunnan; Commercial Vehicles on the Yunnan-Guizhou Road Pass Through; The Bandit Forces in Southeastern Yunnan Are at the End of Their Strength

[Report from this newspaper, Kunming, 18th] Bandit activity in Yunnan Province has gradually expanded towards western Yunnan.

### Four-Power Talks Impossible Before Complete Lifting of the Berlin Blockade; State Department Reaffirms U.S. Stance; Reports of Soviet Special Envoy to Washington Still Unconfirmed

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 18th, broadcast: Lake Success News. The Soviet Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Malik, today denied reports that he had suggested a peaceful solution to the Berlin issue to U.S. Representative Jessup. When asked if the above-mentioned news report by American radio commentator Pearson was accurate, Malik replied, "Pearson often fabricates news." When asked if the numerous peace messages coming from Berlin were all unreliable, Ma laughed in reply, "Sorry, no comment." When asked if there was any truth to the reports that the Soviet Union had sent a special envoy to Washington to discuss the entire Berlin issue, Ma shrugged his shoulders and did not answer.

[United Press, Washington, 17th] The State Department on the 17th refused to comment on radio commentator Pearson's report that the Soviet Union had requested a comprehensive four-power conference on the German issue. State Department spokesman McDermott said that the State Department's position had been explained by Secretary of State Acheson in a statement last week, that the United States was always prepared to listen to any peaceful suggestions from the Soviet Union in the East-West Cold War. According to Pearson, the Soviet Union's suggestion was put forward through its representative to the United Nations, pointing out that they were willing to discuss the lifting of the Berlin blockade. The German currency issue. The separate West Germany and the withdrawal of the occupying forces of the four powers from Germany. Acheson salt said that the importance of this suggestion had been discussed with British Foreign Minister Bevin and French Foreign Minister Schuman. It is said that the State Department's reaction to the simultaneous withdrawal of troops by the four powers was particularly cold, because once the Western Allied forces withdrew from West Germany, the thousands of well-trained armed police in East Germany would pose a serious threat to West Germany. At the same time, Acheson and other American diplomats have repeatedly stated that the Berlin blockade must be lifted before the United States agrees to discuss any future issues in Germany.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 18th] According to conservative newspapers here this morning, Malinin, who advised the Kremlin to adopt a blockade policy against Berlin, is currently on his way to Washington. When he arrives in Washington, he will participate in the negotiations between the Soviet Union and the U.S. Department of State regarding the lifting of the Berlin blockade. The newspaper said that Malinin's visit to Washington was under the pseudonym General Georgiev.

[United Press, Berlin, 18th] East Germans hope to resume trade with West Germany and are now urging the Soviet Union to lift the Berlin blockade. According to the Hamburg-based "World B" newspaper, which is sponsored by the British army, the former Soviet ambassador to Germany, Dekanozov, has been in Berlin for several days persuading the Soviet military authorities to accept his proposal to restore trade and transportation between the eastern and western occupation zones, and this matter is approaching a decisive stage. Dekanozov has a major task in the Soviet policy of occupying Germany.

According to Wilson, the economic advisor to U.S. military governor Clay, the Soviet zone's Economic Commission has informally notified Frankfurt German officials, asking them to work together to restore trade between East and West Germany. However, the U.S. side has not responded to this posture of the Soviet zone with action, because there can be no talk of restoring trade until the Berlin blockade has been completely lifted.

### U.S. Plans to Change Relations with Japan; Seems Intended to Implement an Agreement Similar to West Germany in Japan; Feels the Problem of Allied Control is Quite Tricky

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] American officials here said today that the complexity of the Allied occupation forces control system in Japan would hinder the Allies from reaching an agreement with Japan similar to the one recently concluded with West Germany. It also said that although the U.S. Department of State and the Department of the Army have advocated a similar movement in Japan in the past few months, the conclusion of this agreement would necessarily involve the dissolution of the Far Eastern Commission, including eleven countries, and the cancellation of the Moscow Agreement of 1945.

(The Far Eastern Commission of Eleven Countries was established according to this agreement. The Commission has the right to decide on the general occupation policy towards Japan, and it also stipulates that the Soviet Union has a veto power in the Far Eastern Commission. Although the United States does not need to consult the Far Eastern Commission on certain urgent issues and has the power to instruct MacArthur to handle them, only the Far Eastern Commission has the right to change the regulations for the occupation of Japan or to modify the organization of the occupation authorities.) Diplomatic circles believe that this situation, such as the United States wants to change its relationship with Japan as it did with Germany, in order to open the door to a future peace treaty with Japan, there are the following three ways: (1) The United States obtains the consent of the other ten countries of the Far Eastern Commission, including the Soviet Union; (2) The United States avoids the Far Eastern Commission and gradually achieves an invisible change in its relationship with Japan; (3) Appeals to other Pacific countries to take action regardless of Soviet opposition. It is also pointed out in diplomatic circles here that, although the Soviet representative to the Far Eastern Commission, Pan Youxin, has repeatedly attacked the U.S. Department of State's policy of occupying Japan, taking the second of the above methods, there is still no indication to date that the United States is now prepared to put any of the above three methods into practice.

### Doolittle Delivers a Speech, Atomic Bomb is Enough to Subdue the Soviets

[United Press, Galveston, Texas, 18th] Former commander of the Eighth Air Force, Lieutenant General Doolittle, said tonight that the only thing that can stop the Soviet Union today is the United States' possession of the atomic bomb and the means to transport the bomb to any location. Once the Soviet Union has the atomic bomb, we must have better weapons and better means of delivery. I believe that the Soviet Union already knows the secret of making the atomic bomb, but it does not yet have the tools and factories to make it.

### President Syngman Rhee Announces to Reporters: US Troops Prepare to Withdraw from South Korea; Both Sides are Discussing Withdrawal Dates

[United Press International, Seoul, 18th] South Korean President Syngman Rhee confirmed on the 10th that the South Korean government is discussing the early withdrawal of US troops stationed in South Korea. During a press conference, Rhee stated, "Korean and American representatives are discussing the issue of determining the date for the withdrawal of US troops." However, after the withdrawal of US troops, the US military advisory group will continue to work, "with its mission being to improve and expand our defense capabilities."

He stated that the withdrawal of US troops does not indicate a reduction in the US's obligations and interests in Korea. On the contrary, "the United States will reaffirm its continued economic, military, technical, and other assistance for the happiness and security of Korea." He stated that the Korean army, trained and equipped by the United States, "has rapidly reached the standard of ensuring the security of Korea, assuming that Korea does not encounter external aggression." At the same time, authoritative foreign sources here believe that the South Korean army, numbering approximately 100,000, is sufficient to cope with any provocations by the Soviet-backed North Korean People's Army.

[United Press, Seoul, 18th] President Syngman Rhee of Korea told reporters today that if Korea is not subjected to external attacks, its defense forces will quickly reach the point of guaranteeing security. The US occupation forces were reduced in December last year, and Korea's agreement to withdraw troops is related to the current request for US military supplies. However, the US military mission assisting in training Korean troops is not related to the troop withdrawal negotiations.

He predicted that the United Nations could only become an effective and comprehensive institution including the Soviet Union when the United States and other Western countries alienated the Soviet leaders and the Soviet people. He advocated that the United States should dispatch long-range aircraft to "bomb" the Soviet Union with paper bombs (propaganda).

### Along the West German-Czech Border, US Troops Conduct Offensive and Defensive Exercises; Deploy Zoda Network to Detect Enemy Air Raids

[United Press International, Nuremberg, 18th] 7,088 US troops advanced towards the Czech border for spring exercises, confronting a hypothetical "aggressor" gathering in the east. "Aggressor" is the standard military term for the enemy during exercises. During the last war, Hitler divided his troops into three routes to invade Czechoslovakia. Two brigades of US tank forces are now rapidly approaching the Czech border along the southern route. The First Infantry Division followed closely behind the tanks, intending to resist the "aggressor" who will attack from Czechoslovakia on the 19th. Fighter groups, including jet aircraft, were ordered to take off from permanent bases near Munich and quickly fly to the previously abandoned former German airfields. The heavily guarded "living eyes" also scanned the east with radar, detecting incoming enemy aircraft. In fact, all US troops stationed in Germany have been dispatched from Bremerhaven. The military is now seeking to answer a question: can the United States completely supply the US occupying forces on the battlefield only from the US-occupied zone in Germany? Senior staff officers have stated that communist revolts in other ports in Western Europe could easily disrupt supplies during the most critical days, let alone during a conflict.

### History of Southern Ireland's Struggle for Independence; Finally Achieves Its Wish to Break Away from British Rule

[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] Starting at 00:01 this morning, Ireland has freed itself from centuries-old ties with the British monarch and declared itself the Republic of Ireland outside the British Commonwealth, bringing a new stage to the long political struggle between Ireland and Britain. The first batch of British people to set foot on Irish soil were Norman adventurers from South Wales who invaded Ireland in 1167 AD.

By the end of the Middle Ages, the English immigrants gradually tended to unite. By 1607, Ulster was densely populated with immigrants from England and Scotland, which still retains a majority advantage today. The Act of Union in 1800 meant that Ireland was no longer regarded as another kingdom. Ireland gained one hundred seats in the British House of Commons and thirty-four seats in the House of Lords, but soon after, the struggle to break away from British rule immediately began. British Liberal Prime Minister Gladstone attempted twice in the late 19th century to propose a bill granting Ireland Home Rule, but both failed. Prime Minister Asquith tried again in 1921, but it also failed. However, the people of Ulster were determined and formed the Ulster Volunteer Force to realize their demands. The outbreak of the First European War temporarily shelved this plan, but in 1916, the "Irish Republican Army" then announced the establishment of the Irish Republic, but it did not last long. Within a week, the British forcibly suppressed the rise of the Irish, and sixteen revolutionary leaders were executed by British military tribunals by firing squad, and more than a thousand people were exiled abroad. During the European War, the Irish members of the House of Commons agreed not to raise the issue of autonomy during the war, but a Fale Oireachtas Unity Party emerged in Southern Ireland, launching a difficult political struggle. However, in 1921, the Irish people finally signed a treaty with Britain, allowing Ireland to obtain the status of a dominion, but the Irish riots did not end there. Irish people who opposed and supported this treaty fought each other endlessly, until it ended in 1924. The constitution of 1922 stipulated the establishment of a Senate and a House of Representatives. The first government was formed under the leadership of Cosgrave. De Valera initially refused to participate in parliament because he was unwilling to swear allegiance to the British monarch, but soon agreed to join. In 1931, De Valera jumped from the opposition party to become the leader of the ruling party, which he retained until last year. Last year, Costello organized a coalition government, whose first action was to break away from Ireland's ties with the British Commonwealth, and it has now achieved its wish. However, the Irish have not given up the demand to end the division between Northern and Southern Ireland. They believe that the Irish struggle for independence has not been completed until Northern Ireland is merged with Southern Ireland.

Britain's Status is Not Weakened

[Reuters, New York, 18th] New York newspapers prominently published the news of the independence of the Republic of Ireland and published commentaries. The newspapers generally believe that Ireland's independence does not weaken Britain's status. On the contrary, based on the treaties to be concluded between Britain and Ireland in the future, it can better help Britain's strategic position. Ireland has long been equal to independence politically and practically. Now that it has formally broken away from the British Commonwealth, it can eliminate the suspicion between Britain and Ireland and move towards genuine cooperation.

Leaders of Various Countries Send Congratulatory Telegrams

[Reuters, Berlin, 17th] King George VI of England recently sent a telegram to Irish President O'Kelly, congratulating the establishment of the Republic of Ireland. The telegram specifically mentioned the achievements of the Irish people in assisting the Allied forces in defeating the enemy during the Second World War, and wished the Republic of Ireland a prosperous future and national fortune. President Truman's congratulatory telegram to President O'Kelly stated that he, on behalf of the American people and government, congratulated the Irish people on their future happiness and prosperity. Prime Minister Attlee, Pope Pius XII, South African Prime Minister Malan, New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser, Canadian Prime Minister Laurent, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Italian President Einaudi, and Burmese President Sao Shwe Thaik all sent similar congratulatory telegrams to President O'Kelly.

### Social Affairs Bureau Convened Meeting of Relevant Groups Yesterday; Decided to Adopt a Weekly Salary System; Publish Index Weekly; Discuss Today at the Index Compilation Review Committee

[Our Reporter] The living cost index salary system has aroused extreme dissatisfaction among workers. Because prices have risen wildly recently, rising by an average of 20% to 30% every day, and the living cost index is published every half month, it already feels like a slow remedy. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Social Affairs Bureau invited relevant groups such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Industrial Association, and the Workers' Welfare Association to discuss this issue. Lu Jingshi, Yan E'sheng, Tian Heqing, Pan Shihao, Hong Nianzu, Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xianggao, Fan Cai, and Shen Ding and others attended. Director Cao of the Social Affairs Bureau chaired the meeting. Two opposing opinions arose during the meeting. One faction believed that the living cost index can no longer adapt to the current daily price increases and advocated that it should be abolished and replaced with silver dollars or rice as the basis for salaries. The other faction believed that the living cost index salary system is still a scientific method. The recent depreciation of gold yuan and soaring prices have many reasons, but the blame does not lie with the living cost index, and it can be improved instead of being abolished rashly. Therefore, there were three opinions at the meeting: (1) Improve the twice-monthly living cost index salary system to a weekly salary system, that is, publish the living cost index once a week and pay salaries once a week. (2) Calculate salaries in gold yuan converted from Yuan head silver dollars. According to the method when the currency system was reformed, 2 gold yuan can be exchanged for 1 silver dollar. For example, a base salary of 100 yuan would mean paying 50 Yuan head silver dollars per month. (3) Calculate salaries in rice. When the currency system was reformed, the price of rice was 20 gold yuan per stone. For example, a base salary of 100 yuan would mean paying 5 stones of rice per month, and then converting it into gold yuan based on the market price of the day for salary payment. After detailed discussion at the meeting, most people still advocated adopting a weekly salary system, and the resolution method is as follows: (1) Improve the living cost index to be published once a week, (2) The index should be published every Wednesday morning, (3) The seven days' salary from last Thursday to this Wednesday must be paid off every Thursday, and it must not be delayed for more than two days. If it is overdue, compensation for workers' losses will be made according to the daily interest rate announced by the Central Bank. (4) Piecework and daily wage workers will close their accounts early on Tuesday or Wednesday. If calculation difficulties arise, they will be calculated according to the base salary earned by each worker last week. The Social Affairs Bureau will submit the above resolution to today's municipal government's Living Cost Index Compilation Review Committee for discussion. It will also be studied at the Labor-Management Assessment Committee to be convened tomorrow to see if there are any problems for the employer with paying salaries weekly and not delaying payment for more than two days after the weekly index is published. After they are all passed, they will be submitted to the municipal government meeting for approval and implementation.

### Workers' Lives Threatened; General Labor Union to Discuss Countermeasures Today

The unprecedented soaring of prices for several consecutive days is an even greater threat to workers' lives. According to the person in charge of the Municipal General Labor Union, who told reporters yesterday: As the leading organization for 800,000 workers in the city, the union is very concerned about this serious issue. An emergency standing council meeting will be convened at the union at 4:00 PM today to specifically discuss this issue. In addition to requesting the government to thoroughly and strictly control prices, it will also request the Social Affairs Bureau to advance 50% of the wages of workers in each factory to avoid the impact of devaluation due to severe price fluctuations.

### Newly Appointed Vice Minister of Finance Yang Zhuoan Answers Questions on Finance, Food, and Other Issues

[Our Reporter] Yang Zhuoan, Director of the Emergency Food Procurement and Storage Committee, was recently appointed by the government as Permanent Vice Minister of Finance. He officially assumed office yesterday and is stationed in Shanghai for office work. The reporter made a special visit yesterday to inquire about various current financial and food issues. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:

Q: What is the central task of the Ministry of Finance at present?

A: At present, the fierce fluctuations in prices have greatly affected people's livelihood. How to stabilize the currency value and stabilize finance should be the central task of the Ministry of Finance. The government is actively planning specific methods, and I, as the permanent vice minister, will only follow the government's decisions.

Q: What is the current situation of food sources?

A: For the past six months, we have been planning food sources and funds in extremely difficult circumstances. Since the establishment of the Food Storage Committee, there has never been a fixed budget for food funds, relying purely on temporary fundraising; even if there is a fixed budget, it is equivalent to nothing under the circumstances of continuous price increases. Fortunately, with the full assistance of all parties, the food sources allocated to each department were finally able to reach 60% of the predetermined amount, coupled with 40% of US food, to complete the task of supplying two-thirds of the people's food. There is no problem with Shanghai's household food quota before the end of June. After July, we have already started planning.

Q: How is the process of Shanghai exchanging wheat flour for coal from North China progressing?

A: Because Shanghai is short of coal, the severity is far above food. The Central Bank and the Municipal Government initially believed that it was necessary to exchange coal, so the Food Storage Committee supplied 300,000 bags of wheat flour and entrusted the China Trust Bureau to purchase 15,000 tons of Canadian wheat, which was also allocated for coal exchange. Although the committee has spent a lot of effort in raising food sources, in order to take care of the more urgent needs of the local area, it provided assistance regardless of everything.

Q: Someone accused you of corruption in purchasing food when you were in the Northeast Materials Adjustment Committee. What is the truth of this matter?

A: This matter is still under investigation by the court. The purchase of food was carried out under orders, and everything was approved by the Northeast Headquarters and the Ministry of Food. The food funds were directly remitted by the Central Bank to the governments of Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces, and the provincial governments designated agencies to handle it. The purchased food was handed over to the China Trust Bureau for collection and transportation. I did not handle any money or materials. Even if there are problems, it has nothing to do with me. Fortunately, the court attaches great importance to this matter, and it will not be difficult to find out the truth.

### Social Affairs Bureau Obtains Preliminary Resolution on Cost-Based Pricing of Daily Necessities

[Our Reporter] The Social Affairs Bureau yesterday invited the Garrison Command, the Police Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Industrial Association, the China Textile Corporation, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, and the Coal Adjustment Office to discuss the issue of cost-based pricing of daily necessities. As a result, no concrete decision was made. The Industrial Association hopes that cost-based pricing can take into account the reproduction of factories, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce hopes that cost-based pricing can take into account the restocking of stores. After consultation, a preliminary resolution was made and will be submitted to the Economic Conference convened by the municipal government today for review.

### Economic Meals Rise in Price Again; Now Sold for 40,000 Yuan per Meal

In the midst of the announcement of the living cost index and soaring prices, the economic meals, which were just adjusted on the 16th, were adjusted again yesterday, with the selling price rising to 40,000 yuan per meal. All public employees and salaried workers are extremely anxious about this.

### China Trust Bureau Sells Materials by Tender; Few People Inquire Due to Turbulent Situation

The various woolen fabrics and sundries sold by tender by the Government Materials Sales Committee of the Central Trust Bureau have received little attention. Only one or two people bid for each item, and their bids are often lower than the reserve price, so it is often impossible to sell them. According to the bureau's analysis of the reasons, all of this is because, in the turbulent situation, merchants are unwilling to purchase because they have no definite guarantee.

### Finance Bureau Changes Weekly Meeting to Mondays

[Our Reporter] The Municipal Finance Bureau's weekly bureau affairs meeting, which has been held every Wednesday, will be held every Monday starting this week. The first Monday bureau affairs meeting was convened yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in the bureau's conference room. More than 20 people, including the heads of various sections, attended, presided over by Acting Director Qian Jianfu. In addition, Shen Shangping, the newly appointed Chief of the Slaughter Tax Section of the bureau, officially reported for duty yesterday.

### Evening Edition of the Freedom Forum Newspaper Suspends Publication and Dismisses Employees, Causing Disputes

[Our Reporter] The Chinese evening edition of the Freedom Forum in this city suddenly announced its suspension of publication and reorganization on the 13th of this month. The newspaper has neither dismissed nor terminated the employment of all employees, including editors, reporters, proofreaders, and laborers, nor has it indicated whether it will continue to retain them. The employees of the newspaper's editorial department, because the newspaper company treats employees' lives as a joke, negotiated with the company yesterday. The company's President Shu Quanbao only said: During the probation period, they can be dismissed unconditionally. The employees then sent representatives to the municipal government to meet with Secretary-General Chen to present that the president of the newspaper company had told his colleagues when it was founded that there would be no economic problems within three months. Secretary-General Chen expressed deep sympathy and immediately instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to handle it seriously.

### Sugar Ration for Workers This Month Set at Half a Catty per Person

[Our Reporter] The Social Affairs Bureau decided yesterday that the sugar ration for workers this month will be half a catty of sugar per worker's family member, starting from the 25th of this month and ending at the end of the month, at a price one-third cheaper than the market price.

### Two Rounds of Ships Bring Large Amounts of Mail; North-South Mail Service to be Temporarily Suspended

Will Resume After the Second Phase of Barter Contract is Signed

According to postal sources: Currently, north-south mail service relies solely on coal-carrying ships for transportation. After the first phase of the powdered coal barter contract signed by the China Trust Bureau and the Kailuan Coal Mine expires, there will be an interruption of ships going north for a period before the second phase of the contract is signed, and north-south mail service will also be temporarily suspended. The Tangshan ship arrived in Shanghai on the 16th, carrying 432 bags of mail. The Dasheng ship arrived in Shanghai on the 17th, carrying 241 bags of mail, mostly small packages. These two ships are transporting the last batch of Kailuan coal south under the first phase of the contract. As for using airmail, it is also because there are no scheduled flights, and it is only entrusted to personnel of the Peace Delegation to carry it on special planes, so the quantity is extremely small. The airmail sent by the Shanghai Post Office to the China Aviation Corporation's special plane No. 531 a few days ago has not yet flown out.

### Tuberculosis Center Clinic Actively Promotes Work

In order to carry out group tuberculosis prevention work in this city, the Tuberculosis Center Clinic has organized group health checkups.

In order to review the past and develop future work, the clinic invited representatives of various groups entrusted to handle group tuberculosis prevention checkups to hold a symposium at the YMCA in Baxianqiao at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. They exchanged opinions on how to expand publicity and how to gather social and economic forces to actively promote tuberculosis prevention work. The situation was very enthusiastic, and the meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.

### During the Prosperous Season for Yellow Croaker Fish, Facilitate Customs Clearance Procedures as Much as Possible

The yellow croaker fish, known as one of the four major fish runs, arrived in Wusong yesterday with four ships. This is the beginning of the official listing of yellow croaker fish this year. The Garrison Command previously stipulated that the entry and exit time for fishing boats was from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM in order to control ships. However, the entry and exit of fishing boats and fishing vessels must go through customs clearance procedures. The Shanghai Fisheries Association, considering that the fishing season is at its peak and there are many fishing boats, in order to save time and avoid rushing and affecting the entry and exit order, sent a letter to the Wusong Branch of the Jianghai Customs, requesting that it leave a part of its staff on duty from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM every day to designate the handling of entry and exit procedures for fishing boats, in order to maintain the livelihood of fishermen and promote service efficiency. It is reported that the staff of the Wusong Branch of the Customs has agreed to do so.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Due to the pervasive war and soaring prices, students are experiencing extreme difficulties in their lives, leading to school dropouts, illness, malnutrition, academic decline, and anxiety, among other serious issues. There are over 30,000 university students in the city, about one-third of whom come from remote provinces. Now, due to the interruption of their economic resources, they are living in extreme poverty. Furthermore, due to poor nutrition, many are suffering from the terrible disease of tuberculosis. The Shanghai Student Relief Committee, organized by the Shanghai YMCA and YWCA, has launched a fundraising campaign to help needy students solve their living problems, aiming to raise five thousand silver dollars. The fundraising period is set from April 24th to May 6th. A charity bazaar will be held at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA from May 4th to 6th, along with a student life exhibition. The slogan for the fundraising is "The more talent we cultivate, the more construction power the country has!" The fundraising methods are as follows: (1) One Friend, One Dollar Movement: Anyone who donates one silver dollar at a time will be a "Friend of Students." Donors of ten silver dollars or more will be honorary "Friends of Students." The goal is 2,000 people. (2) Donate Items for Charity Bazaar: Donations of clothing, daily necessities, food, artwork, and any other items for the charity bazaar to be held at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA from May 4th to 6th are welcome. The committee is also willing to help arrange direct delivery of large quantities of goods to schools for students to eat if desired. (3) Special Project Donations: (A) Tofu Supply Station: A donation of 500 silver dollars can maintain a tofu supply station that provides tofu for 3,000 students for half a year. (B) Pig Raising: A donation of 200 silver dollars can establish a pigsty at a school to raise ten piglets, which can continuously supply the student dining hall with food after half a year.

Negotiating with Cheng Chung Hospital to Treat Students with Tuberculosis

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Student Relief Committee, in order to enable needy students with tuberculosis who are enrolled in universities and colleges to have the opportunity to receive treatment, has recently obtained the support of the China International Relief Committee and the cooperation of Jiangwan Cheng Chung Hospital. Starting from the 20th of this month, Cheng Chung Hospital will allocate two additional wards specifically for the hospitalization and treatment of sick students referred by the Student Relief Committee. The initial quota is set at thirty students. In addition to being responsible for subsidizing all medical and hospitalization expenses for these thirty sick students, the Student Relief Committee will also regularly provide the sick students with various educational books, newspapers, magazines, and recreational equipment to adjust their lives while sick, so as to achieve spiritual treatment effects.

Keeping Sick Students in School, Providing Soy Milk and Eggs

In addition, for needy students with milder conditions who do not require surgery or hospitalization, if the school authorities can allocate a portion of their dormitories as isolation and treatment rooms for these students with tuberculosis to live in, and agree to reduce their class time according to the doctor's instructions, the Student Relief Committee will provide nutritional subsidies, responsible for subsidizing the supply of soy milk, eggs, cod liver oil, or various vitamin supplements. The Shanghai Tuberculosis Center Clinic will cooperate in the medical care and treatment. The initial quota for this item is set at 120 students, with national universities having priority.

### Over Fifty Northern Students to Go to Hangzhou Today to Discuss Resumption of Studies

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yu Xiaoci, Deputy Leader of the Ministry of Education's Committee for Guiding the Resumption of Studies and Employment of Youth, has returned to the General Association in Hangzhou. The Jiangsu Guidance Office of the committee, located in Suzhou, remains in Suzhou and has not moved to Shanghai.

### Representatives of Municipal Primary School Principals' Association to Petition the Municipal Education Bureau Today, Demanding Improved Treatment and Maintenance of Livelihood

The Municipal Primary School Principals' Association held a members' meeting the day before yesterday. Due to heavy rain, it was changed to a discussion meeting, and it was decided that Hu Huai-tian, Wang Li-ben, Pan Jie-mei, and three other representatives from the welfare group would go to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Education Bureau at 10:00 AM today to request improved treatment in order to maintain teachers' livelihoods. The main points of the petition decided at the meeting are recorded below:

(1) The minimum living standards of teachers and staff should be maintained. 1. Previously unpaid rations in kind should be fully paid by the 25th of this month. 2. The in-kind rations for April should be cancelled and converted into silver dollars at market prices for prompt payment. 3. Employees' monthly salaries should be paid in full according to their base salary, without any deductions, and calculated according to the city's cost-of-living index, to be paid on the 1st and 16th of each month. 4. Please follow the precedent of paying employees of national colleges and universities in advance and pre-pay the salaries of teachers and staff for May, June, and July for three months. 5. Please pre-issue employee welfare rice for May, June, and July for three months to meet urgent needs. 6. The water and electricity subsidies for April should be paid before the 25th of this month and then paid by the 5th of each month thereafter. (2) For principals of schools in the Pudong district traveling back and forth across the river, please issue free ferry passes as usual as a gesture of preferential treatment. (3) School building rents should be based on the schools' requests, whether calculated in terms of rice prices or the cost-of-living index, verified and released early. (4) Requests for temporary fees from various schools should be promptly investigated and verified for release, and there should be no bureaucratic delays that hinder progress and cause devaluation losses. (5) School operating expenses are far from sufficient. Please adjust them to a base of 20 yuan per person per month and issue them at the same time as employees' salaries according to the cost-of-living index.

[Additional Report] The Municipal Primary School Principals' Association has decided to adopt a postal voting method for the re-election of the current board of directors and supervisors. The voting ballots for each member will be issued immediately and will be counted by the supervisors at the No. 1 Center in the Fifth District of Yingshi Road on the 24th of this month (Sunday), it is said.

### First Spring Art Exhibition; Displayed Works Give a Fresh Impression; Outstanding Young Artists to Be Awarded Certificates by the Education Bureau

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, this reporter walked to the French Association on Nanchang Road, behind the Fuxing Park, to visit the First Spring Art Exhibition organized by the Preparatory Office of the Shanghai Art Museum. In fact, Shanghai has held many art exhibitions in the past, but this one is labeled as the "First" because its exhibition style is said to adopt the "Salon" method of the spring and autumn seasons in Paris, France, to encourage young artists and improve the level of art. This type of art exhibition is the first of its kind in Shanghai, and has therefore attracted close attention from the cultural community.

The First Art Exhibition opened on the 15th of this month and is scheduled to last for nine days, closing on the 23rd. It includes over 400 works from various departments of the visual arts. Among the works, traditional Chinese paintings are still the most numerous, which is an inevitable phenomenon. Based on the characteristics of national traditions and the convenience of Chinese painting tools and materials, works are naturally easy to produce. The distinction between good and bad Chinese paintings lies in whether the painter can express a new spirit and a new look in the work. In this exhibition, many famous painters have participated with fresh works, such as Chen Zhifo, Liu Haisu, and Zhang Shulv's flower and bird paintings, Qi Baishi's figure paintings, and Xiao Quan and Wu Hufan's blue and green landscapes, all of which give visitors a fresh impression. However, it cannot be said that a change of subject matter is necessarily superior. There are many works here that still express infinite new interests in the old style, such as Zheng Wuchang, Tang Yun, Yu Shaosong, Zhang Zhongyuan, Wang Geyi, and Zhu Meicun, whose skills and interests all show a sense of courage and progress. In addition, young artists such as Fang Xutong and Huang Zhenglun can also be given great hope.

Relief Carving and Ivory Carving Worth Promoting: In addition to Chinese paintings, Western paintings, oil paintings, and watercolors are about half and half, among which most are entries by young artists in the competition. In general, they are all very meticulous and conscientious, and the paintings are very particular, which is an advantage. The general shortcoming is that the influence of Western color printing is too great. Since there are many differences between the original and the printed matter, if scholars exaggerate further, many drawbacks will arise and the main points of natural beauty will be lost. In this exhibition, there are works by Yan Wenliang, Fang Junbi, and Ma Xuncao, whose rich experience gained from painstakingly depicting nature is worth observing and referencing.

In addition to paintings, there are round carvings and reliefs by Hua Tianyou, Teng Baishi, and Liu Kaiqu, as well as ivory carvings by Zhou Xianchu. Although the quantity is small, they are very exquisite and worth promoting. It is hoped that artists will cheer up and work hard to create, so that the quantity of finished products in the next exhibition can be comparable to that of paintings.

Hoping to Create a Glorious Page: The First Spring Art Exhibition, after the hard work of Shi Chongpeng, director of the Art Museum Preparatory Office, and others, was finally opened at a time when the situation and public sentiment were extremely turbulent. This is a miracle, and their contributions cannot be erased. On the other hand, it is also sufficient to reflect the Chinese people's love of art. The art world does not succumb to troubled times. On the contrary, times of hardship can produce brand new masterpieces, which is a common occurrence in art history.

Conservatism is enough to hinder progress, and the art world is certainly no exception. This Spring Art Exhibition aims to discover new young artists. After strict criticism of the displayed works, those deemed to have outstanding achievements will be awarded certificates by the Education Bureau to encourage them, the significance of which is very profound. It is hoped that young artists can take this as the starting point of a milestone, move forward without limits, and create a more glorious page for the history of Chinese art. The First Spring Art Exhibition is rich in educational meaning, and this reporter is introducing it with special solemnity.

### Qualifications for Navigating Ships: Shipping Association Resolves Three Points; Those Originally Sailing the Northern Routes Should Have Priority for Going North

The North-South Navigation Group of the Shipping Association held a meeting on the afternoon of the 18th to discuss the qualifications that ships going north should possess. Shen Qi, Li Yunliang, Zhong Shandao, Dong Haoyun, and others attended. Three key points were resolved: (1) Business Standard: If the ships of various shipping companies have always sailed the northern routes, then those ships should have priority for navigating north. (2) Performance Standard: The performance of ships going north should have a draft of no more than 15 feet and a hull length of 300 feet. These types of ships have priority to participate in navigation. The next priority are ships with a draft of more than 18 feet and a hull length of more than 300 feet. (3) Request Government Approval: If the ships of a shipping company that have been approved to participate in navigation encounter major accidents such as annual repairs that make them unable to sail, other ships that meet the standards may be dispatched to replace them. The replacement ship does not need to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval again. It only needs to be reported to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and the Shanghai Customs for record before the replacement ship raises anchor.

### Accused of Extortion in German Doctor Case; Baden and Others Declared Not Guilty

[Report from Our Newspaper] German overseas doctor, Stoller, accused former Municipal Police Bureau Foreign Affairs police officers Baden, Grassiner, and Soviet real estate developer Van Xue Lieff of colluding to threaten and extort him. The District Court has concluded its trial after several hearings, and yesterday announced that due to insufficient evidence, all three defendants were declared not guilty.

### The Northeast Behind the "Oriental Iron Curtain"

(Continued from page two) In early February, the Communist government ordered all residents of South Jiutiao and South Batiao in Shenyang to move out, reportedly to provide housing for Soviet troops. The presence of Soviet Railway Protection Police along the Chinese Changchun Railway, and Soviet engineers repairing the Dalinghe Railway Bridge, were all witnessed by those on the scene. The rapid increase in the number of Soviet overseas residents in Shenyang is also noteworthy. Particularly noteworthy is the relationship between the Communist government of Dalian and the Northeast Administrative Committee (the highest administrative body of the Communist Northeast). Personnel from the publicly-owned production organizations of the Communist Northeast, holding travel permits to travel to Pulandian in order to enter Dalian were turned back by Soviet troops and not allowed to enter. On one occasion, Mr. Zhou Zhenhao accompanied two Korean merchants attempting to travel to Hainan via Dalian, and was also stopped at Pulandian, while the Koreans were allowed to pass. From this, the relationship and nature of the Northeast Administrative Committee and the Communist Democratic Government of Dalian can be seen. The impression of the Soviet troops obtained is different from those previously seen in Shenyang and Changchun. They are cold and stern, and not moved by watches, pens, or money. Dalian is clearly within the scope of a Soviet-style iron curtain.

As for the large-scale dismantling and transportation of machinery and materials by the Soviet army in the Northeast, the explanation of Huang Qizhi, deputy manager of the Northeast Bank, is: "Suppose my home is occupied by thieves, and now a neighbor drives them away for me, and takes away a chopstick and a bowl, what attitude should I take?" This popular explanation is overly forced, but there seems to be no better public explanation besides this. It can be proven that the Soviet Union has no possibility of returning the dismantled machinery to the Northeast.

A week after the Communist army entered Shenyang, Mayor Zhu Qiwen convened a meeting of consuls from various countries stationed in Shenyang and announced three handling steps: (1) Confiscate radios, (2) Stop the supply of water and electricity, and (3) Request to leave the country. According to Zhou's eyewitness account, in early February, the British Consulate on Erwei Road was still surrounded and guarded by the Communist army, cutting off traffic, just like a plague-stricken area.

Daily necessities in Shenyang, such as matches and soap, are of extremely poor quality. Soap is reddish-brown and black. Caustic soda, bleaching powder, and industrial fats are extremely lacking. The matches used in Shenyang all come from Andong, which is produced by the Andong Match Factory that the Communist Andong Radio has always promoted. The matchsticks are uneven in thickness, and the black medicine on the head varies in amount. Less than half of each box can be used. This shows that the matchstick cutting machine lacks repair parts, and at the same time lacks refined ordinary chemical raw materials.

Residents of Shenyang without household registration are called "black people," suspected of counter-revolution, and their situation is extremely dangerous. The Communist Party has always believed that it has failed to capture personnel from the Central Unification Bureau and the Military Unification Bureau. According to a Shenyang newspaper in February, a certain Red Army cadre (who participated in the 25,000-mile Long March) was sentenced to death for releasing a Central Unification Bureau personnel after accepting a bribe of twenty taels of gold. Shenyang has not carried out large-scale arrests, but residents are ultimately not allowed to leave more than 120 li outside the city after signing for travel permits, so it is equivalent to a complete detention. It is not as free as moving in and out of Peiping. It is naturally not easy to predict what the future situation of Peiping will be. However, comparing the current situation of Peiping and Tianjin with Shenyang, the people's freedom of life is one in the depths of the earth and the other in the clouds. In Shenyang, if you stay overnight at a friend's house, you must report to the Public Security Bureau. You cannot talk for long when visiting friends, the content of the conversation will be investigated, and you cannot whisper, otherwise the Communist Party members will open their suspicious eyes, revealing a nervous glimmer, and ask questions, but the whispers of party members are not subject to this restriction, as if it were a privilege they could be proud of. The food situation at home is also the subject of investigation. If the diet is better, their economic sources will be questioned. The three key points of the personal investigation in the Baojia organization are: (1) The economic source for maintaining life, (2) Friends' contacts and the content of their conversations, and (3) Why they have not worked in the democratic government system. Donations are not called "donations," but "voluntary contributions." The Communist Party believes that "apportioned donations" are a product of the Kuomintang. The Communist Party only has "voluntary contributions," but in reality, it is still a "donation," which is the so-called style of "wanting to have an affair but also wanting to erect a chastity arch."

Shenyang's commerce is declining, and merchants have the slogan "sell it all, eat it all." Taxes are extremely heavy, and purchasing power has collapsed. Except for grain and gold, which are relatively stable in price, nothing else is cheap. For example, tax tickets such as liquor tax have a time limit of one month. If they cannot be sold after one month, another tax will be levied, to infinity. This method is called liquor monopoly and does not exist in other parts of the Northeast except Liaoning Province. Zhang Xueshi, chairman of Liaoning Province, has great military and political power. What is not stipulated by the highest institution, the Northeast Administrative Committee, Zhang Xueshi has his own unilateral measures. He is actively recruiting old subordinates of Zhang Zuolin, but none of Zhang Zuolin's old people have responded. On the contrary, they advised Zhang Xueshi not to do it. Another Northeast cadre, Lü Zhengcao, has been relieved of his military duties and appointed Minister of Railways of the Administrative Committee. He seems to be frustrated.

The former chiefs of the various offices of the Northeast Suppression Headquarters are still in Shenyang. Zhou Fucheng is also there, Zhang Baochi is in Harbin, and Zheng Dongguo is freer in Harbin, and is not treated the same as other captured military officers. People from Harbin said that Zheng often appears on the streets in a car.

### Batch of Political Prisoners to Be Released on Bail Today

[Report from Our City] The City Prosecutor's Office was ordered to handle the issue of releasing political prisoners on bail. Chen Shoutao and Wang Daozhou, two prosecutors, and Zhong Xianda and Zhu Yuhuang, two court workers from the District Court, conducted a joint review at Shanghai Prison the day before yesterday. After a meeting to discuss the results yesterday morning, the office decided to release twenty political prisoners on bail today. Those who met the political prisoner release regulations included Hua Defang, Lu Zicheng, Gong Shaomin, Chen Zemin, Jiang Haiqiu, He Zhongwen, Wang Zhongyi, Zhou Yunlong, Fang Shenghong, Luo Zhizhong, Tang Xinyu, Gong Boder, Yu Chengxin, Yao Haigen, Wang Mingyuan, Yang Guangming, Su Fukang, and Zhang Zhiming. Zhou Jinlong and Yang Changmin were not purely political prisoners but met the ordinary bail methods (the above twenty people were sentenced by the former Special Criminal Court and detained in Shanghai Prison). In addition, there were Qiu Yiqing, Feng Mingliang, Ying Zhenzhong, Xu Zhenyuan, Gu Sanmao, Wang Qiuping, Zhu Fusheng, Shen Pengjie, Yu Qinxue, Xu Kuijun, Wang Changming, and Zhang Qingde, who were detained in the prison. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters was asked to investigate and release them. Furthermore, Zhang Nianen, Huang Ganren, Yu Defu, and Fu Jiajun were temporarily not allowed to be released on bail because they violated the Emergency Crime Punishment Act Endangering the Nation and committed murder. Their cases will be submitted to higher authorities for decision.

[Additional Report] The District Prosecutor's Office sent letters to relevant parties last week requesting investigation and release of detained political prisoners, but no response has been received as of yesterday. However, over twenty cases of applications for bail have been received by the office yesterday, including over forty detained political prisoners. The office is currently verifying with the relevant parties.

They dispatched officers and seized a large revolver and fifteen bullets at his residence. In addition, a Jinling brand pistol that had been sold to Ding, a material shop owner in Gaoqiao, Pudong, was retrieved. The criminals Sun Quantai and Su Ciping were arrested successively and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation on suspicion of endangering public safety.

### Rickshaw Owner with a Black Heart; Charging Rent in Rice; Destroying the Union

General Labor Union News: Jin Zhixian, the owner of a rickshaw, in the midst of soaring prices, actually intends to calculate the rickshaw rent in rice, stipulating six liters of white rice per day, to be paid according to the market price of the day. The rickshaw pullers Chen Zhenggui, Li Senlin, and Shen Chengfu, believing the burden to be too heavy and unreasonable, reported to the Southern District Branch of the Rickshaw Workers' Union, requesting mediation. However, the rickshaw owner refused to attend the meeting and instigated over twenty unidentified thugs to destroy the writing desk, photos of directors and supervisors, and the portrait of the founding father in the union hall. The three rickshaw pullers have now taken the rickshaw owner Jin Zhixian to the Songshan Police Station, requesting legal action.

### Guangci Orphanage Hopes for Donations from All Sectors

The Guangci Orphanage was founded in the seventh year of the Republic of China. The orphanage is located in Minhang Town, Shanghai County, with 45 acres of land and over 160 orphanage buildings. Over 1,200 orphans have been cultivated over the past 30 years. When the August 13th Shanghai Battle broke out, all the buildings and equipment in the orphanage were destroyed. It then moved to Shanghai. After the victory, with the assistance of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, 11 simple orphanage bungalows were built on the original site, and it moved back to continue its educational work. Because of the lack of land rent income and few donations, it currently only accommodates over 50 orphans. However, with soaring prices and huge expenditures, even the education of these dozens of orphans is in danger of running out of food from time to time. It urgently hopes that all sectors will donate generously so that the educational work can continue.

### General Shi Jue Arrives in Shanghai to Intensify Military Deployment

### Instigating Disciples to Rob and Murder, Yang Zaichao Sentenced to Twelve Years

[Our Report] Yang Zaichao, who runs the Xi'an Theater in this city, instigated his disciples Ye Baoshan, Liu Jincheng, and more than ten others on December 4th last year, at approximately 9:00 PM, to take axes, iron bars, and other weapons to the New China Cinema at 1754 Nanjing West Road to rob Gu Jinxiaomei and Xian Jinfu of their property.

### Water Inspection Station Police Officer Accused of Corruption, Trial Begins

[Our Report] Zhou Xiulu, a native of Chaozhou, came to Shanghai from Shantou on the China Merchants Bureau's Haihang ship in January of this year, carrying sixteen gold bars from Hong Kong, each weighing six ounces, totaling ninety-six ounces. After the ship arrived at port on January 13th, Zhou, being new to Shanghai and aware of the many criminals at the Shanghai docks, entrusted Fu Arong, a third-class steward on the ship, to carry the gold ashore. Unexpectedly, as Fu was carrying the gold and intending to hire a sampan to go around the long way, he was spotted by Shen Long, Li Yiren, and Chen Liangcai, volunteer inspectors from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters' Water Inspection Station, and Zhu Bomao, a police officer from the Security Police Brigade. Seeing that he was in a hurry, they immediately ordered him to be inspected. Fu then returned to the ship and requested to return to the cabin for inspection. The gold bars were then seized. Shen and the others, blinded by greed, threatened him with charges of smuggling gold and disrupting the financial order, intending to confiscate all of it and pocket it for themselves. After Fu pleaded bitterly, they returned six bars and took ten bars. They then found forty silver dollars in Fu's drawer in the cabin, issued a receipt, and told him to contact the Water Inspection Station to claim them, but did not specify the number of gold bars confiscated. Afterwards, Fu truthfully told Zhou, who then reported the matter to the Water Unified Inspection Team of the Garrison Headquarters, who arrested Shen and the other three. Fearing that Fu had swallowed the gold in private and made false accusations, they were also detained together. After investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office, Shen and the others were prosecuted on charges of corruption. Yesterday morning, the District Court, presided over by Judge Meng Tingke, heard the case and questioned Fu in detail. The defendants only admitted to taking forty silver dollars and denied confiscating the gold bars. The plaintiff, however, recounted the details of the extortion in court, and filed an incidental civil suit, demanding that the court order the return of sixty ounces of gold. As the case still needed further investigation, the hearing was adjourned.

### Hanging and Poisoning, Three Suicide Cases

### Murder for Money, Russian Woman's Bloody Case in Qingdao, Solved in Less Than Sixty Hours

— Our Reporter Lei Ming

[Our Report from Qingdao, 13th by Airmail] The Qingdao City Police Department today solved a case of a Soviet man robbing and murdering a Russian woman. The circumstances of the murder were extremely brutal. The case was discovered at 9:00 PM on the 10th. From the on-site investigation, situation assessment, case pursuit, to the arrest of the murderer and the search for stolen goods and weapons, the entire case was solved in less than sixty hours. The entire case was based on physical evidence, not relying on confessions. It should be a model case in police investigation. The speed and smoothness of the case's resolution can be attributed to extensive preliminary investigation and preparation work. Liu Guozhu, the director of the City Police Department, personally supervised the police officers and deployed them day and night, which greatly contributed to the capture of the murderer before he could escape to Shanghai and solve the case.

Husband Returns Home, Wife Murdered

The discovery of the case is as follows:

At approximately 9:00 PM on the 10th, the Russian musician Ba Qianzao (50 years old), residing at 8 Zhanshan Third Road, returned home after finishing work in the city and discovered that his wife (45 years old), Ao Wugusi Zhi Ba Qianzao, had been murdered in their private residence and their property had been stolen. The elderly couple, Ba Qianzao and his wife, had been married for many years and had lived there for a long time, without any children. Ba Qianzao immediately reported the incident to the South Branch Police Station. Upon learning of the incident, Director Liu Guozhu, Deputy Director Ma Xiang, Criminal Police Captain Chen Hongju, and others immediately rushed to the scene to investigate and completed the investigation at 4:00 AM the next day. The investigation work included taking photos, taking fingerprints, observing and recording the scene, registering the lost property, and interviewing nearby neighbors.

Hands Tied Behind Back, Upper Body Prostrate

The murdered Russian woman's hands were tied behind her back with window curtains, and her head and neck were also tied with window curtains. Her head was struck with an iron instrument in nine places, two of which were struck with a pistol butt. Her face was covered in blood. Her upper body was prostrate on a sofa bed placed in the corner of the wall, her knees were kneeling in front of the bed, and blood was splattered all over the wall. The scene was extremely tragic. The murder site was the room on the right upstairs. The cabinets and boxes in the downstairs bedroom were ransacked, and clothes and supplies were scattered. Items that ordinary people would consider valuable embroidery and utensils were not lost. Only 60 US dollars, a fox fur coat (worth 500 US dollars), a yellow coat, a navy blue suit, and some gold-plated jewelry were lost, including a gold cross, leaving only the base, and the cross had been pried off, worth about 1,000 US dollars in total. According to a white Russian woman neighbor: She went to the house at about 7:00 PM, intending to chat with the murdered woman (the two usually had a good relationship, and visited each other every day). She knocked on the door, but no one answered. She looked inside through the glass window and saw that the bedroom door was closed. She realized that she had heard the deceased say she felt slightly unwell during the day, and thought she might have fallen asleep. She came to visit at about 8:00 PM. When she knocked on the door, no one answered. Looking through the glass, she saw that the door was open and felt puzzled, never expecting that she had been murdered.

Scene Situation, Three Judgments

Based on the various situations at the scene, Director Liu Guozhu remained silent for half an hour, then made three judgments and instructed his subordinates to solve the case within a time limit.

(1) This case is a murder for money, with no political motives, nor is it a revenge killing or a love killing. The incident occurred between 5:00 and 7:00 PM.

(2) The murderer is a foreigner. (Chinese bandits usually only seek money and do not kill, and would not abandon items that are commonly considered valuable, nor would they pry off a cross). The method of binding is foreign. The brutality of the murder is Russian. Among the Soviet and White Russians, some people live in hardship, and other foreigners would not take such risks. It should be a Soviet or White Russian.

(3) The murderer may be familiar with the deceased, so he must kill to silence her. There is more than one murderer.

Investigative Scope Quickly Narrowed

Therefore, according to the foreign resident registration form, eight Soviet and Russian residents with bad behavior were immediately put on a blacklist. The murderers, Babunov and Isay, were actually listed as first and second. According to daily investigations, these two were originally well-known ruffians. As a result of the four-way investigation, the investigative scope was quickly narrowed by comparing the time of the incident with the people on the blacklist one by one. It was believed that Babunov and Isay were the most suspected, and a separate pursuit began.

Babunov (25 years old), a Soviet citizen, has no regular job and often resides in Chinese and foreign brothels. He usually resides at his girlfriend's house at 34 Zhengyangguan Road. On the night of the incident, he changed into a new set of clothes and resided at his girlfriend's house at 39 Rongcheng Road. He usually gets up at 11:00 AM, but the next day he got up very early, and tidied up his luggage, looking like he was leaving. Isay (19 years old), a Soviet citizen, his father has declared to the police that he has severed his father-son relationship. He is currently a waiter at the Zhongxing Bar and resides at his girlfriend's house at 7-4 Nanhai Road. He has not been to work at the bar since the night of the incident.

Two Criminals Captured, Confessed After One Interrogation

On the morning of the 13th, Dong Zuolin, a patrol officer from the Criminal Police Division of the South Branch Police Station, Police Chief Li Bin, and criminal police officers Wang Jingyan and Huang Jiashu, took photos of Ba and Yi and went to the Dongfang Market area on Longkou Road to search separately. They found Ba and Yi walking side by side out of the market. Criminal police officer Huang Jiashu went forward alone and captured Isay. Babunov escaped. Isay was brought to the police station for interrogation. Isay was still wearing the grassy green woolen coat and gray velvet trousers he was wearing when he committed the crime. There were 26 bloodstains on his upper body, which had been wiped, but were still visible. He initially hesitated, but the police station planned to chemically test the bloodstains on his clothes. He then revealed the truth and demonstrated the process of the murder. The police station believed that it was consistent with the results of the on-site investigation and provided the possible whereabouts of Babunov. At 1:30 PM, Babunov was captured at 34 Zhengyangguan Road. Ba was wearing the stolen navy blue suit and a stolen item was found. Isay's bloodstained trousers were found at a friend's house on Qidong Road, with 15 bloodstains on them. The iron bar used as a weapon was found in the soil in the racetrack. The stolen goods and evidence were complete. He confessed after one interrogation.

Lacking Money for the Festival, Intended to Commit a Crime

According to the confession, Babunov met Isay at the Dula Camp Bar on Guanxian Road in the spring of last year. They often visited each other afterwards. A week ago, the two met at the Sannada District's home on Rongcheng Road. Sa and his mistress were not at home. The two talked about the upcoming Easter on April 24th and needed money to celebrate the festival, so they had to use their brains. Three days later, they met at the Soviet Club. Ba said that the new house being built at 8 Zhanshan Third Road was the residence of Ba Qianzao, who works as a musician in various bars. Ba Qianzao must have money, so they planned to rob him. On the afternoon of the 5th, Yi borrowed a pistol with 52 bullets and handed it over to Babunov near the United Hotel. The next day, he fired a shot at the racetrack to check its effectiveness. It was also decided to do it on the 9th. On the 9th, Ba hid the gun and went alone, but saw a Chinese working in the yard and returned.

Pretended to Rent a House, Threatened with a Gun

On the afternoon of the 10th, the two first met at the Zhanshan Haishan Bathing Beach. Ba, holding the gun, went first. Seeing that the room was quiet, he whistled to call Yi forward to knock on the door together. It was about 6:00 PM. When Ba Qianzao's wife opened the door, the two claimed that they wanted to rent a house. Ba's wife did not suspect anything and welcomed them in. When entering the room on the right upstairs, Babunov still said that he was willing to rent this house for one month for 10 US dollars a month. Before he finished speaking, he pointed the gun at Ba's wife, forbade her from making any noise, and said that if she took out the money, he would not hurt her, otherwise he would kill her. Ba's wife was shocked and wanted to shout, and said that she had no money. Ba quickly covered her mouth with his hand, and Yi tore off the window curtain to tie Ba's wife's hands and stuff her mouth, strangling her head. Ba first planned to wrap her head with a window curtain, and then put the gun into her mouth to shoot Ba's wife to death to reduce the volume, but ultimately found it inappropriate. He decided to use a pre-buried two-headed pointed iron bar, and Yi smashed her head to death. Babunov went downstairs to rob, and Yi still held the gun to guard Ba's wife.

Escape to Shanghai Failed, Murder Case Solved First

According to the murderer, when committing the crime, they heard someone knocking on the door outside, so the two hastily robbed and escaped from the kitchen to the back door. They did not expect to get only 60 US dollars, so they were very disappointed. Babunov sent two coats to the post office to be sent to Shanghai. The sender was "Bruguov, 34 Zhenghai Customs Road", and the recipient was "Bi Lov, French Concession, Shanghai." (The police station immediately filed a claim with the post office.) The two planned to escape to Shanghai first, and then to Yantai. If the investigation work was delayed by one day, the two murderers might have boarded a ship south on the 14th, making the complete resolution more difficult. It is still under study whether the entire case will be sent to the court or the garrison headquarters. Director Liu Guozhu rewarded the police officers, including South Branch Director Zang Maqi, for their quick case solving and outstanding efficiency. The police station has sent a letter to the Shanghai Police Department to assist in the investigation of Ba and Yi's suspected crimes in Shanghai.

### "Emperor's Tomb" Causes a Sensation in Yixing City, Preliminary Excavation Report of the Ancient Tomb in Gaocheng Town

— Our Reporter Zhu Xianggao

[Our Report from Yixing, 17th] There is a large tomb in the Dadaqiao area of the first Bao of Gaocheng Town, Heqiao District, this county, commonly known by the locals as the "Bao Emperor's Tomb." The reporter searched through the county annals of this county, but could not find any such record. However, the locals have recently been talking about it suspiciously, saying that they discovered a divine light emanating from the tomb at night, and that the tomb contains rare treasures. The rumors are diverse and the stories vary.

On the morning of the 13th, the farmers carried their farming tools to excavate this "Emperor's Tomb." After a day's effort, they only discovered the stone gate and stone threshold of the tomb. Now they have also made a big hole in this stone gate, because there is no sunlight entering inside, and it is pitch black. The villagers, who had seen little of the world, began to spread rumors that there was a magnificent building inside, with two iron coffins hanging on iron hooks. After the news spread, it caused a sensation far and wide. Residents from dozens of miles away also came to visit. The reporter, accompanied by Zhou Piyue, a director of the local Reporters Association, went to interview them.

The special car went directly to the Tianzhutang. Guided by the local guide, we walked two Huaili to the northwest. From dozens of feet away, we could see thousands of men, women, and children surrounding the mound, which was about two Zhang high. Three huge earth mounds were arranged in a character-shaped formation. A large area was planted with many tombs, trees, flowers, and plants, which appeared to be very old. The reporter first inspected the outside of the mound, front, back, left, and right, for half an hour, which shows the large scope of the tomb.

After asking an elderly farmer who was nearly 90 years old, it was said that the Bao Emperor's Tomb was likely a relic of the Jin Dynasty. As for the origin of the popular saying that the interior was the burial place of Bao Long, Bao Hu, and Bao Sanniang, there was no way to explore it. In the past, the local area was inhabited by descendants of the Bao family, but unfortunately, they have now disappeared, so there is no way to investigate it. As a result, the tomb has also lost its caretakers and has gradually fallen into disrepair.

The excavation site was in the southern mound. After a day's work, it has been dug down from the horizon to a depth of more than two people. Two white stone doors appeared in the depths of the tomb, about three feet and five inches long, one foot and five inches wide, and four inches thick. There were two stone thresholds, more than one foot thick, above and below the stone doors. The four sides were made of green ancient bricks, each of which was more than twice the size of a city brick and weighed more than thirty Jin. Because the volume was too bulky, there was no way to pick it up and hide it. The bricks were flat and intact, and there were no patterns or ancient characters on them, so there was no way to rub them for publication for archaeologists to study. According to a scholar in the village, he speculated that they were Han bricks, but in the reporter's opinion, they seemed more like Jin bricks, because the Yixing group was set up only during the Jin Dynasty. The tomb bricks piled on the ground are now being freely transported by the villagers, and the town office does not interfere. In fact, they do not know how much value they have. Only a few bookworms who were watching the excitement were shaking their heads and sighing. The villagers who were excavating were so enthusiastic that they thought that the self-defense team soldiers who were protecting the reporter were going to interfere, and they were so scared that they ran away. They probably thought that they would come to excavate again after we left. Therefore, the reporter repeatedly reminded the mayor of Gaocheng Town that if they were allowed to transport it naturally again, it was likely that the objects with archaeological value would be lost in a short period of time, and it was urgent to send someone to protect them and seal them up as soon as possible. Mayor Chen has already promised. The reporter and his party returned to the city today and heard that the local people have submitted a request to the government for protection and to order a special agency to formally excavate it. Once the government approves it, it can be formally excavated. It will be clear what was left behind, whose tomb it is, what is contained inside, and whether it has historical archaeological value.

On this trip, the reporter was given detailed instructions by Zhou Shouyue, the interviewing director of the Yongyan Newspaper. I hereby express my gratitude.

### Market Stroll

— Watching the Guests

Yesterday the Central Bank Didn't Move; Today's Trend Will Be Nebulous

Yesterday, the market was filled with caution, so the morning was weak.

The Central Bank didn't take the bait immediately, so the sentiment changed, and the afternoon saw a recovery of lost ground, regaining interest, and then rising further. As long as this trend continues daily, it will be difficult for the Central Bank to "steal a chicken" (make a quick profit).

The payday period has passed, and the big spenders are now despondent. The bloodsucking friends have already left fully loaded, shifting their battlegrounds. What remains are the wage earners, who lose a few drops of their blood and sweat every time they spend a dollar.

This is the world of capitalism!

If you want to ask about conscience, you have to look for it in another world.

Today seems to be a turning point for the overall situation; market dynamics are bound to be nebulous and unpredictable.

Those who are astute should calmly observe the changing situation.

Those who are adept should find this a most interesting day.

General prices are still going crazy.

This is due to interest costs and the illusion created by the stock market's limit-up situation.

In fact, the stock market's limit-up, calculated according to the limits, is only about equal to the interest rate.

High interest rate policies have this benefit.

Market makers in the stock market have begun new activities.

Of course, given the overall situation and future card plays, new activities may be revised.

However, the possibility of no revision is currently equal to the possibility of revision.

The "selling" policy seems to have become the target of public criticism.

With Pei Tsu-yi's past experience as a lesson, Liu Gong-yun's courage is admirable.

A little over a month ago, some people expressed approval of Pei Tsu-yi's policies.

But Liu Gong-yun, who copied Pei's style, was "liquidated" after playing for a month. This seems contradictory, but it was actually expected.

In this society, people are only allowed to make excessive profits. Bearing the blame for artificially inflating prices is absolutely not allowed to hinder others' excessive profits or to attempt to control prices.

Since the Hong Kong authorities announced the gold ban, the Chinese community has been actively launching an offensive against the Hong Kong government.

Given the difference between the market price of gold in Hong Kong (320 HKD per ounce) and the theoretical official price (200 HKD per ounce), wealthy individuals are afraid of buying at a price that is too low and losing out, so they are currently adopting two major strategies to threaten the Hong Kong authorities:

(1) To promote in Guangzhou that large amounts of Hong Kong gold are being smuggled into Guangzhou, undermining the credibility of the Hong Kong customs' anti-smuggling efforts, so that the Hong Kong authorities will set a high purchase price.

(2) To sell off Hong Kong dollars in large quantities in Guangzhou, lowering the value of the Hong Kong dollar, in order to threaten the credibility of the Hong Kong dollar and create a de facto devaluation.

### Important Figure in Changzhou Grain Embezzlement Case: Former County Magistrate Weng Cheng Sentenced

[Our newspaper's Wujin 17th dispatch] During his tenure, Weng Cheng, the former county magistrate of this county, had his confidant Lu Pinjin serve as secretary of the Grain Bureau and head of the Third Section. Lu Pinjin held excessive power and engaged in corruption and embezzlement in countless ways. Later, he colluded with Wu Shuchun, the director of the Caoqiao Office warehouse, and employees like Shou Xuefan and Sheng Rongxiang to transport tax grain to Wuxi for processing and profit. When the case was exposed, Lu Pinjin, Shou Xuefan, and others were arrested and imprisoned. At the time, Weng, in his capacity as county magistrate, provided much protection. In the end, he had them released on bail, conveniently allowing them to escape without a trace. The District Prosecutor's Office repeatedly summoned Weng to court for investigation. After a year, it was concluded that Weng Cheng was indeed suspected of the following four main points:

(1) Lu Pinjin and Shou Xuefan were Weng's henchmen, and Weng acted as a guarantor for Lu, leading to their escape.

(2) Lu Pinjin colluded with Wu Shuchun to transport tax grain to Wuxi for processing, embezzling more than 40 shi of rice. After the case was exposed, only Wu Shuchun was dismissed from his position, without further investigation.

(3) An investigation by the Grain Department revealed that Lu, Shou, and others converted surplus rice into 25 shi of rice and embezzled 30 million yuan, which was divided with Weng for their own use. They also altered the seven customs declarations without authorization, substituting粳 rice for 秈 rice, and dispatched Sheng Rongxiang, an employee of the Grain Bureau, to release Shou Xuefan during transport, allowing him to escape.

(4) The failure to handle the Lu-Shou case properly demonstrated collusion and conspiracy between superiors and subordinates. …Therefore, a public prosecution was filed with the criminal court. On the morning of the 15th, President Zhang of the District Court summoned Weng Cheng to court and invited Prosecutor Tao to conduct a public trial together.

Based on the above points, the court sentenced him to three years and six months of imprisonment, five years of public censure, and ordered the recovery of the price difference between 2,057 shi and 2 dou and 7 sheng of unprocessed粳 rice and 秈 rice. Weng Cheng was immediately taken into custody and sent to the detention center. Weng is a native of Zhejiang and has served as the county magistrate of Yongjia, Qingtian, and other counties. This imprisonment serves as a warning to corrupt officials, and it is unknown what Lu, Shou, and others who are still at large are thinking.

### Gold Found While Digging on University Hill in Zhenjiang: Ancient Burial Objects Divided Equally Among Seven Workers

### Service Briefs

Where is there help in need? Reader Mr. Su, 22 years old, from northern Jiangsu, with an elementary school education, worked in a small cloth factory, is extremely loyal and conscientious, and comes from an extraordinarily poor family. He recently lost his father and has an elderly mother in her seventies. Recently, he unfortunately became unemployed, and his clothing and food are threatened, causing him much grief. He is now urgently seeking employment, just like a dried fish waiting for water or a severe drought hoping for rain. He urgently needs benevolent, righteous, and enthusiastic compatriots with a spirit of human mutual aid and cooperation to sympathize and help him, arouse compassion, and bestow or introduce him to any job that provides food and lodging, in order to continue a glimmer of hope. Then, he will turn despair into life and will never be able to repay you. Please inform Zhu at No. 313, Damu Road, Shanghai (16).

Seeking Publication of Books

(1) Mr. Wang Boming recently compiled "A Chronological Table of Births and Deaths of Famous Chinese Figures," totaling fifty pages. If any major bookstores are willing to publish it on behalf of the author, with the goal of promoting culture, he is willing to transfer the copyright. Those interested can contact him through the Central National School of Wanshi Township, Yixing.

Selling Books

Mr. Zhou Haikun intends to sell his collection of "Jiaxing Prefecture Records" in forty-eight volumes and the imperially approved "Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government" in sixteen volumes.

Claiming Funds

He hopes that the person who asked him to buy the tickets will go to the First Dormitory of the Qianghua Technical School on Datongmen, Zhonghua Road, this city, to claim the money.

### Price Limit Not Approved by Social Bureau, Rice Market Still Closed Yesterday, White粳 Sold for as High as 1.14 Million Yuan Off-Site

[Our dispatch] The Social Bureau stipulated yesterday that the price of rice should not exceed 1 million yuan per shi. The North City market did not open, and only 500 shi of low-quality rice were traded in the South City market, all below 1 million yuan per shi. Yesterday, Director Cao of the Social Bureau reported, based on reports from rice merchants, that the price of rice in Wuxi yesterday was around 1.46 million yuan per shi. Director Cao was asked if the price today could be based on this price as a standard. Director Cao instructed that the maximum price of rice today should not exceed 1.2 million yuan. However, according to a personal investigation by our reporter at rice stores last night, the retail price had reached 1.5 million yuan per shi.

[Another dispatch] The Social Bureau relaxed the price limit for rice to 1 million yuan, but trading in the market still could not open because the price at the place of origin was high, the cost was high compared to the price limit, and the price of rice in Zhoupu and other places had reached 1.4 million yuan. Therefore, cargo owners are all waiting and watching and not trading, and the market is still closed.

In off-site transactions, white粳 was selling for 1.2 million and 1.4 million, thin rice for 1.4 million, and early rice for 1.3 million. The market outlook has weakened. If credit tightens again, prices are expected to fall today.

Cooking Oil initially rose and then fell, but ultimately rose again. At the opening, the rise in rice prices made people very bullish. Shengrong oil reached a high of 7 million yuan, and soybean oil reached a high of 8.5 million. At the close, due to tight credit, prices fell rapidly. Shengrong oil fell to 6.2 million, and soybean oil fell to 7.8 million. Crude oil was at 7 million, a rise of 500,000 and 1 million respectively. Soybean cake trading was scarce, and Changzi cake was 350,000 yuan.

Flour prices continued to rise sharply. At the beginning of the market, influenced by the issuance of large banknotes and the surge in prices in off-site markets in recent days, people were extremely bullish. Those holding goods were unwilling to sell easily, fearing that they would not be able to replenish them after selling. At the start of the market, prices jumped by 30-50% across the board. Midway through, news of the Central Bank's large-scale release of funds caused credit to tighten immediately. At the close, interbank interest rates were high, and cargo owners were forced to sell off, causing the market to collapse. Lao Che once broke the 500,000 mark but retreated to 450,000 at the close. Bingchuan traded at 425,000 at the last transaction.

### Large Denomination Banknotes Supplied to Meet Needs in Other Cities, Credit Tightens Sharply in the Market, National Bank's Efforts to Sell and Withdraw Funds Become More Active

[Our dispatch] Although the Central Bank announced yesterday the start of issuing three types of 50,000 yuan banknotes, a responsible person from the bank told reporters: At present, these large banknotes are still mainly supplied to meet urgent needs in other cities and are not expected to circulate in Shanghai in the short term. Yesterday, credit in various markets continued to tighten as it had over the weekend and showed no signs of easing. On the one hand, the Central Bank's efforts to sell and withdraw funds became more active, with gold, cotton yarn, foreign exchange transfer certificates, sugar, and other commodities all being offered at the same time. Although the quantities offered were large, the market was unable to absorb them due to tight credit.

For example, only 208 bars of gold were requested, and only 208 of the 1,245 bales of cotton yarn offered were requested. Therefore, although the prices of various commodities were eager to rise upon hearing the issuance of large banknotes, they were ultimately constrained by credit and unable to rise, resulting only in a sideways market.

It is also rumored that the security authorities will begin today to strictly control transactions in various markets, such as limiting the range of price increases and decreases and temporarily suspending trading if the limits are exceeded. If this is indeed the case, then the frantic speculation and price increases of the past two weeks may be slightly curbed.

### Gold Prices Continue to Rise

[Our dispatch] Yesterday, in the gold market, rumors of crossing the river spread, and people were unsettled. The issuance of 50,000 yuan banknotes created a bullish environment, and buying interest remained strong. Due to limited restrictions in the market, trading remained suspended, with prices shouted as high as 7.258 million, the upper limit, resulting in a market with prices but no trading. In off-site spot trading, prices opened as high as 9.5 million and 10.5 million in the morning. Due to unrelenting pressure from the Central Bank, Da De Cheng and Zhao Feng Chang gold firms were commissioned to gradually sell off at 9.3 million, down to 9 million. Due to tight funds and few buyers, only a little over 100 bars were sold. As spot goods flowed in from Hong Kong, prices retreated to 8.8 million and 9.1 million, and the market closed at noon at 9.1 million and 9.4 million.

### Potential for Squeeze Still Strong, Chinese Stocks to Rise Sharply

[Our dispatch] The Chinese stock market is still showing potential for a squeeze. After the major players aggressively entered the market last week, the strength of the bullish momentum has been unexpected. Such a performance has made it impossible for the shorts to fathom the depths of the market.

Yesterday, news of the situation worsened, and credit tightened in the market, with most factors being bearish. However, many players have already made a covert exit to avoid reversals. After pushing up prices in the morning, they gradually sold off, and the market finally retreated at the close. In the afternoon, due to the convenience of deferral, it is expected that credit will ease after tightening, and although there will be twists and turns in the situation, the reality will not be as simple as the rumors suggest. Therefore, major players are still mostly absorbing shares, and the market will rebound again.

Yong Sha opened in the morning and immediately hit the upper limit of 110 yuan and 5 jiao. Various parties successively sold off, retreating to 101 yuan. Off-site, it was even pushed down to 97 yuan. Later, the shorts covered their positions, and the price rose to 106 yuan and 5 jiao at the close.

Small and medium-sized stocks were also spurred by Yong Sha at the opening and initially reported limit-up. Xinhe, Meiya, Xinguang, Jingfu, Qinxing, Huafeng Department Store, Guohuo, Rongchang, Tongyi, Yonggong, Lianan Department Store, Zhabei, Shangwu, Zhongyi, Zhenhua, Zhonghuo, Shangni, Taitang, and 19 other stocks all opened at the upper limit. Prices retreated in the middle, and the market recovered slightly at the noon close.

In the afternoon, Yong Sha opened at 110 yuan and 05 jiao, still opening at the upper limit and remaining unchanged at the close. Applications for sales were first made at 107 yuan and 5 jiao, and the price once lingered around 100 yuan. However, it then rebounded as it was resisted at the low, and buying suddenly surged. After fluctuating, it rose again to 110 yuan at the close. Many of the other stocks also reached their limits. A total of 2.8825 billion shares were traded.

### Gold Bonds at Limit Up, Foreign Stocks Continue to be Popular

Yesterday, credit tightened, and Chinese stocks first rose and then retreated, with the gold public bond following the trend. Prices fluctuated greatly in the middle and hit the limit-up several times. The market closed slightly lower at noon. It opened at 3.2 million and rose to 3.456 million, hitting the limit. After buying at the previous day's limit-up price in the afternoon, trading immediately became quiet and there was not much activity, with very few transactions. There was a squeeze of 576,000 yuan.

Foreign stocks continued to be strong. In the morning, the sharp rise in foreign exchange certificates and the briskness of Chinese stocks made people feel good. Various parties continued to absorb shares, and the market closed with another squeeze. Yisha was 235,000 yuan and 245,000 yuan, up 5,000 yuan. Yinglian was 260,000 and 280,000. Yi Chang was 46,000 yuan and 48,000 yuan. Yazhou was 26,000 yuan and 28,000 yuan (there were no transactions on Saturday). Yaoguang was bought at 90,000 yuan, and Huidong was bought at 1 million yuan. Neither was sold.

### Exchange Rate of Gold to Silver Dollars Still One to Fifty-Two Yesterday

[Our dispatch] The Central Bank's exchange rate of gold to Yuan Datou silver dollars remained unchanged yesterday at the old price of one liang to fifty-two yuan. About 4,000 liang of gold were exchanged yesterday, resulting in the release of about 200,000 yuan in silver dollars.

[Our dispatch] Yesterday, at the Stock Exchange Building, the exchange ratio of gold to silver was initially 47.50 for Datou and once rose to 48.51. It then fell to 47.50 near noon. In the afternoon, it fell further to 45.50. Xiaotou was at 58, with only selling and no buying. Yinglongyang had no market.

### Silver Dollar Arbitrage Not Active, Street Trading Initially Firm but Then Weak

[Our dispatch] Yesterday, silver dollar arbitrage was not active, and the exchange rate was stable. About 100,000 sets were sold to the Hua North area, while trading with Hua West was sluggish, with only a few tens of thousands of yuan being traded.

Street trading was initially firm but then weak. In the morning, the market was chaotic due to the efforts of individual buyers, and Datou once hit the 200,000 mark, reaching as high as 210,000 and 230,000. At noon, because the rise in gold prices was relatively stable, various parties sold off at high prices, falling to 190,000 and 210,000. In the afternoon, the shorts covered their positions, and the price rose again to 200,000 and 220,000. Xiaotou was quoted at 160,000 and 180,000, and Yinglongyang was quoted at 120,000 and 140,000.

### Cotton Yarn Price Increase Slightly Controlled, Cloth Market Closes at Low Prices

Yesterday, the rise in cotton yarn prices was somewhat controlled. Due to the continued tightening of credit, people were quite worried, and purchases were rare, so the result was still an increase, if you include the interest, not enough for the costs.

42s Lanfeng opened in the morning at 66 million and once briefly hit the 70 million mark, closing at noon at 63 million, 6 million higher than the previous week. 32s Yinyue fell from 47 million all the way to 44 million at the close, and closed 6 million higher.

21s Shuangma spot was initially 33 million, reaching a high of 36 million, and finally traded at 34 million, up 4.5 million. 20s Shuangma broke through the barrier and closed at 30.5 million, 4 million higher than the weekend. Other yarns, such as Jincheng Tiannv, were traded at around 30 million. 16s Guangming also approached 30 million, and 10s Children's Army was at 24 million. Trading in other yarns was quiet, and all parties adopted a wait-and-see attitude.

The trend of cotton cloth was vague. In the morning, people were still hoping for higher prices, and purchases continued to be enthusiastic, with new high prices emerging one after another. However, after 9:30, news that the opening price of gold was not enough to cover interest costs and that credit was still tight, with overnight interest rates between 20 and 30 yuan, caused sentiment to turn bearish. Retailers began to sell, and prices fell from high levels, with prices near noon mostly leveling out with the previous off-site prices.

Longtou Xibu rose from 1.23 million to a high of 1.26 million, but then fell to 1.05 million near noon, closing at 1.08 million, still 180,000 higher than the noon closing price on Saturday.

Sijunzi Huaji opened initially at 1.2 million, reached a high of 1.215 million, fell to 1.02 million before the close, and finally traded at 1.04 million, an increase of 170,000. People in the aftermarket are again considering action, raising prices by 30%, opening Longtou Xibu at 1.38 million and Sijunzi Huaji at 1.36 million. With limited trade, it may be difficult to stabilize today.

### Silk Initially High then Retreated

The rayon market yesterday was initially high but then softened. 120s bright new goods opened at a high of 31.6 million for spot settlement and were immediately bid up to 32 million. However, after news of a sharp drop in foreign exchange certificates and tighter credit, off-site hoarders began to close out their positions, falling to 31.2 million, and closing at 31.6 million. Next-day delivery initially traded at 37.5 million but then softened to 36.5 million at the close.

Raw silk opened in the morning with 78 degree white factory silk for spot settlement at 48 million, then rose to 52 million. However, due to the sharp rise and fall of foreign exchange certificates, the market softened, closing at noon at 48.5 million. Next-day futures initially traded at 61 million but finally closed at 59 million at noon.

### Encas and Shanghai Police, Two Seeded Teams, to Battle Dolphin and Donghua Tonight

[Report from Our Newspaper] In the Mayor's Cup basketball tournament, two seeded teams in Group Three, Encas and Shanghai Police, will battle Dolphin and Donghua respectively this evening. The two winning teams will meet next week to compete for the final spot in the round-robin finals. Tickets for the municipal gymnasium are still divided into three categories: 5,000 yuan upstairs, 10,000 yuan downstairs, and 20,000 yuan for reserved seats inside the court. The schedule is as follows:

Encas - Dolphin 6:00 PM

Shanghai Police - Donghua 7:00 PM

The Encas players are mostly veterans who have lived in Shanghai for many years and are very familiar with the strategies and strengths of the various Chinese teams. In addition, they possess superior physical attributes. Their strength is such that they can threaten any team. In this league, they recruited Boto, the main player from the American Meteorological team, with great ambition. Although for various reasons, they did not win the league, they defeated the runner-up Renyu in the first week and put on a spectacular performance in the final game against the league champion Hualian. Now joining the Mayor's Cup, they have also invited giant mainstay Tao Bolinji to help them, with the intention of compensating for their losses. Dolphin is one of the top teams in Group Two. Tao Yingshi, Huang Tianlie, Lu Miaosheng, and Hou Yongkang are all young and strong. Recently, they defeated the champion of Group Two, Section D, the Shan team, and are at their peak. Facing the strong Encas tonight, although victory is unlikely, they will certainly pose a considerable threat to the foreign troops.

In the Shanghai Police versus Donghua match, the latter is making a guest appearance in the basketball arena with a soccer player's style. Although they started late, their style is fierce and they are extremely brave. In addition, they have veterans like Zhou Dayun, Chen Xianglong, and Cai Yanxiong, who are intelligent and brave. However, Shanghai Police is one of the top teams in Group One, with strong strength and particularly sharp fast-break skills. Recently, they have been training hard. In comparison, Shanghai Police is more likely to win.

### Dagong Basketball to Fight McLeans Tomorrow

After returning from their expedition to Nanyang, the defending Mayor's Cup champion Dagong basketball team has not yet officially revealed their skills. It is reported that they will make their first public performance tomorrow night at the gymnasium, and their opponent will be the McLeans team. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.

### Shocking Hong Kong: A Good Game, South China Wins by Two Goals, Buses Regret Leaving the Field

[Hong Kong Aviation News] "During the Qingming Festival, the rain falls in torrents; on the road, the souls of the travelers are broken." This ancient poem seems to be a sharp portrayal of the weather in recent days and the Buses fans who lost to South China yesterday!

Similarly, the Buses heroes, who adjusted their lineup to cope with this important game related to the future of the runner-up position and worked hard throughout the game, even experiencing several unfortunate situations where victory was possible but not achieved, inevitably felt frustrated. Even more unbearable was the fate of the thousands of fans who squeezed in the rain to buy tickets, endured the pushing and shoving of "scalpers," and were still turned away because the stadium was full. They sighed that it was not worth it!

In this shocking "South China vs. Buses" battle, both sides lived up to the expectations of the fans. South China's two-goal victory was not accidental, and Buses' loss, although it affected their future, was the result of their best efforts. Their performance was no worse than their opponents, and they could take comfort in their spirit.

Many "critics" believe that Buses' experience was not as good as South China's in the rain. Ma's sprints were useless! In other words, Buses' defeat is all included in this sentence. In fact, this view only applies to ordinary times. Judging from the wise and brave performances of Deng Yijie and Li Chunfa in yesterday's game, with their wonderful passing and rushing, it is enough to prove that this is a "clichéd" view.

In fact, both sides are seasoned veterans. In terms of experience, Buses is not weaker than South China. They were able to see in yesterday's game that under the slippery conditions caused by the rain, they could not use high, long passes and long-distance quick attack tactics. This is because South China's defenders have a defense line that combines both strength and flexibility. It is impossible to break through with just fierce quick attacks without clever infiltration. Buses' forwards had such a "knowing the enemy and knowing yourself" mindset yesterday. In addition to consistently maintaining Wenzhi as the center of command for passing, Yijie and Chunfa also had skillful and agile dribbling skills. When appropriate, they did not give up the opportunity to rush forward for profit, which is commendable. Dahui and Shijin were also able to cooperate with this tactic, creating a lively advancement of the entire Buses forward line. The reason they could not succeed was due to Yu Yaode's repeated saves and the bad luck of several shots hitting the crossbar.

People's criticisms also attribute Buses' loss of two goals to Tan Junqian's poor saves. In fact, if Buses had not had Lao Tan guarding the goal yesterday, displaying all his skills, South China would have won by more than just two goals. Because what Buses lost yesterday were not easy goals, but "center balls" from close range, as fast as lightning. We saw the mischievousness of South China's three inside forwards, which showed that their victory was not accidental. Fei Chunhua also played well. Only He Yingfen lacked vitality, which may be due to "Blackie" being unaccustomed to the left position, which seems forgivable.

In short, in this "good game," the offense and defense of both sides were balanced, and both sides were able to grasp the time and did not let go of any opportunity. The fact that South China's forwards won and their defense remained unbeaten was the reason why Buses' forwards could not succeed. The lineups of both sides in this game are as follows: (Fifteen Lang)

South China

Zhang Shuling, Liu Songsheng, He Yingfen, Zhu Yongqiang

Yu Yaode, Xie Jinhong, Zhang Jinhai, Feng Jingxiang

Hou Rongsheng, Xie Jinhe, Fei Chunhua

Buses Team

Tan Zhenhui, Feng Kunsheng, Zhuo Shijin, Zou Wenzhi

Tan Junqian, Kong Qingyu, Deng Yijie, Li Chunfa

Mai Linfu, Deng Sen, Li Dahui

Under the whistle of "Referee King" Aoma, the ball launched the offensive under the feet of Deng Yijie, but soon South China gained the advantage. On this side, "Second Uncle" shot twice from long range, both over the crossbar. Zhu Zai also used a hundred-step piercing Yang, and "Blackie" and Jinhai's two headers were all cleared by Junqian. However, after a long attack, He Yingfen forced two corner kicks. In the last one, Second Uncle intercepted it and handed it over to Yongqiang. Zhu Zai did not hesitate and lifted his feet to shoot. Junqian could not save it because it was a sudden cold arrow. Therefore, South China laid the foundation for victory in the sound of firecrackers lit by the supporters.

The second half continued to face off. In the early stage, South China still had the upper hand. Once, Liu Songsheng took advantage of a free kick outside of Buses’ offense and took a fierce shot at the goal. Zou Zhiwen desperately headed the ball to break the crisis, but he fell to the ground and fainted and had to be taken off the field for treatment. South China took the opportunity to heavily surround and attack. Songsheng received the ball in his heart and handed it to Zhu Zai. Yongqiang darted forward and shot, as fast as a shooting star, creating another great achievement for South China (two to zero)

Not long after, Wenzhi reluctantly returned to the game and launched a fierce offensive. Especially Li Dahui’s several crosses and Shijin’s several timely headers were saved by the well-positioned “Liangde”. Afterwards, the momentum was still strong, but there was still no way to break the egg. In the 70-minute battle, Buses finally left the field with a loss of two goals.

### Group B Table Tennis League: Six Matches Today

Yucai Young Players Overwhelm Agricultural Machinery the Night Before

The fourth Table Tennis League has been underway for a week since its start. The results of each game will be announced in the order they are received. The organizing authority recently reviewed the schedule for the first week and found that the record sheet for the match between Guansheng and Agricultural Machinery in Group B3 on the 14th has not been submitted. It has not been reported whether the game was held or whether both parties agreed to postpone it. Failure to comply with the regulations shows a lack of spirit. It is now limited to two days to notify the meeting of the details. If it is overdue, both parties will be considered to have forfeited. Tonight (the 19th), starting at 7:00 PM, there will be six more Group B matches in the table tennis rooms of Jing Zong, Chouye, Shanbao, and Deng. The strong Zhaoshang team in Group B2 won a big victory over Lianqing with a score of five to zero in the first game. It is worthy of being a seeded team. This is the second time they have played and they meet Shanghai Police. Although the latter is led by educator Ma Qingzhi, the team's experience is not as good as Zhaoshang's, and it is expected to be more dangerous than auspicious. In the next scene, Lianhe will face off against Jiaotong. The former won the Insurance Cup runner-up. Last week, the new force of the debut, Tiemai, was weakened due to the absence of veteran Shi Jianzhang. It only won a narrow victory with three teams to two. Jiaotong has strong player Sheng Risheng participating. If Lianhe does not send its full force, it is afraid of being threatened by the opponent. Among the other four groups, the match between Nongji and Jingwei in Group B3 will be a fierce battle. Jingwei are all young players who have just debuted. They are physically flexible and willing to fight and run. If Nongji treats them lightly, they will undoubtedly suffer a poisonous hand. The schedule for each night and the results of the previous day are recorded as follows:

Today's Schedule

Zhaoshang - Shanghai Police (Group B2) 7:00 PM Jing Zong

Lianhe - Jiaotong (Group B2) 8:30 PM Jing Zong

Jiaolong - Chouhong (Group B3) 7:00 PM Chouye

### Table Tennis Strong Team Hualian Team Participates in Group A Competition and Wins Championship

The Hualian Table Tennis Team has participated in the first and second Group A Table Tennis League, ranking among the best and being known as one of the five strongest teams at sea. In the previous competition, the team split into two groups and joined the competition under the names of Hualan and Nanhua, which affected their strength and their results were not very good. However, Hualan still relied on the efforts of veterans Zhang Zhihong, Deng Xiurong, and Li Zhen to win the fifth place. This year, they are still registered under the name of Hualian, and held a team member meeting at 7:00 PM last night at Dekang Lane, Luofu Road. The list of staff members is as follows:

Liang Jintang (Advisor), Chen Linsheng (Instructor), Huang Qingtang (Leader), Zhang Zhihong (Captain), Li Ziping (Clerk), Yang Zhixiong (Secretary), Deng Xiurong, Li Zhen, Lu Wenliang, Zhong Zhizhi, Pan Rixi, Zheng Jiakun.

### Table Tennis Knowledge

— Written by Wang Xinjing, Edited by Chen Linsheng

The limit is the representative of the heart. Skilled table tennis players do not pay attention to watching the ball, but measure the opponent's face with their eyes, according to the direction of their own counterattack. Therefore, skilled table tennis players often observe the opponent's eyes to judge the direction of the opponent's return. However, this decision is often easily fooled. Some people focus their eyes on a certain direction, but hit the ball in the opposite direction. This kind of playing style is more likely to confuse the opponent and make it impossible to cope.

(8) General Practice Steps

To improve at table tennis, you must go through the appropriate steps and practice step by step, and you will improve quickly. For example, children learning to run must first learn to stand, and then learn to walk. When they are walking steadily, they can learn to run. If they can't stand yet, it is impossible to ask them to walk, and it is even more impossible to ask them to run.

To practice table tennis, you must first lay the foundation for defense. That is, when competing with others, you must first defend and maintain not losing, and then look for opportunities to attack.

There are many ways to defend. The first thing to learn is "close blocking." Regardless of whether the opponent's ball is lightly drawn or heavily hit, you must return the ball with the most honest attitude, only seeking to hit it a few more times to prolong the opportunity to practice. After practicing hard like this, after a certain period of time, you will gain more experience, become familiar with the nature of the ball, and be able to respond to any kind of ball. Then practice "far blocking" and "chopping." After practicing various defensive methods, take it a step further and practice "light drawing." Although this kind of light drawing does not have much power, it is more powerful than "chopping," and can prevent the opponent's fierce attacks or fierce chopping, and can make the ball more accurate and less hard. After practicing light drawing with considerable certainty, gradually increase the power of "drawing" under accurate conditions, reaching the point of fierce attack and hard knock.

"Close blocking" is the basis of "far blocking" and "chopping," and "light drawing" is the basis of fierce attack. Therefore, to practice the ball, you must practice defense. To defend, you must first practice "close blocking." After practicing "close blocking," "far blocking," and "chopping" well, you can take it a step further and practice light drawing and fierce attack. This method is like building a house and laying the foundation first. If the foundation is deep-rooted, the danger will naturally be less.

### Thoughts Inspired by the Cheongsam

— Suo Bei

Observing the styles of women's cheongsams, one finds them truly interesting.

Their styles have not fundamentally changed in over thirty years, yet they are constantly evolving, and the frequency of these changes is accelerating. Consequently, when the patterns become exhausted, the gimmicks have been fully exploited, and there is no room for further ingenuity, they simply revert to the old styles of several years ago. In short: it is nothing more than from old to new, from new to old, from wide to tight, from tight to wide; sometimes long is popular, sometimes shorter is popular, or zippers replace buttons, then zippers return to buttons. Moreover, because the time of change is becoming faster and faster, the materials of cheongsams are also becoming more and more inferior, because a cheongsam can't be worn for very long anyway. And precisely because of this, the number of cheongsams made is increasing, and the number of pattern changes is becoming even greater.

The reason women do this is simply to gain the attention of passersby with astonished eyes. However, after changing back and forth, the cheongsam is still a cheongsam after all. Therefore, the style of the cheongsam is gradually failing to attract people's favor.

Ladies, please don't misunderstand! The purpose of this article is not about cheongsams, but to use them as an analogy to describe our "financial policies." Because the financial measures of recent years are doing the same job with different approaches, just like the cheongsams on your bodies.

For example: the legal tender has been in circulation for too long, and one inevitably feels that its "generous" style is too rigid, so it is replaced by the petite and exquisite "gold certificate." But the tone of the gold certificate is also tiring to look at, so one wants to try the "silver certificate."

According to the law of evolution of women's cheongsams, the style of the silver certificate will either be the same size as the debased currency or even smaller and "cuter" than the gold certificate. The latter is more likely, because the time the gold certificate was popular was more than twenty times shorter than the legal tender, so how long the silver certificate will last is difficult to determine. Therefore, it is better to make it small and thin.

Although the legal tender is not called a "certificate," its essence is indeed just a "certificate." It must be known that this "certificate" is the crux of the problem, so gold certificates and silver certificates are bound to share the same fate as the legal tender. From gold certificate to silver certificate, to copper certificate, to lead certificate, to "foreign lead skin certificate," this is a natural trend of one certificate being worse than another, which is no different from the principle that the more patterns women's cheongsams change, the more the material "deteriorates."

From the cheongsam to the "silver dollar certificate" is just an association of real life. I hope gentlemen and ladies will not read this article with a stern face, just laugh it off.

### ### The Candidate Who Made a Fortune

— Mao Yi

In any country, those who participate in local or central elections are either famous or wealthy and powerful. Otherwise, lacking any appeal or confidence in the election, they would not only waste time, energy, and money, but also make themselves look foolish. However, in the history of US presidential elections, there was an unknown and powerless young man who participated in the election. Although he was not successful, he actually made a fortune.

This person who used the election to make money was named George Francis Train. He was originally an unknown commoner who suddenly announced in 1870 that he would participate in the 1872 US presidential election. Train had no political background and no sponsors. He simply said that he was a Democrat and wanted to be nominated by the Democratic Party.

He actively campaigned throughout the country for several months before the nomination convention. However, at the Democratic nomination convention, Train's name was not even mentioned.

Everyone felt quite sorry, because such efforts had been wasted. But Train himself was not discouraged after the election failure. Several years later, everyone realized that his participation in the election had another purpose: not for fame, but for profit.

He gave hundreds of campaign speeches, and people who attended the speeches had to pay for tickets. Because his participation in the election was different from others, without background or momentum, although admission tickets were required for each speech, many people still came out of curiosity. After hundreds of speeches, Train actually received about 100,000 US dollars in ticket revenue. From then on, he "withdrew from the political arena" and lived comfortably in the countryside.

### ### Odds and Ends of the World

— Chen Qiji

A professor at the University of California in the United States said: Every kiss between a man and a woman shortens life by three minutes. Because every time you kiss, the chest beats, and the blood circulation in the heart is uncoordinated, so 484 kisses will shorten one day of life, and 75,000 kisses will lead to death one year earlier.

Baharah of New York can be called the Sherlock Holmes of the fur industry. If you give him a hair plucked from a fur coat, after his scientific examination, he can tell you not only the species that produced the hair, but even the location where the animal lived, the season when it died, and the food it liked when it was alive.

The United States has recently invented a typewriter that can be called the smallest in the world. Its volume is only three cubic inches, and its function is the same as that of daily use. This machine is most useful for travelers.

### ### Advance Preview of "Middle-Aged Woes"

— Li Ruiyun

By chance, I saw a secret preview of "Middle-Aged Woes." After seeing "Fake Phoenixes" and "Long Live the Wife," the audience unanimously recognized that Sang Hu is a master of comedy, whether he writes or directs; in this new work, Mr. Sang Hu has taken a further step in his handling of comedy. He has already passed the stage of "making comedy" (that is, so-called gimmicks), and let the play itself give the audience a "feeling of joy." Therefore, the development of the whole play is smooth and light, like a beautiful poem, but every shot and every foot of film has a deep connotation, which makes people smile knowingly.

From "Fake Phoenixes" to "Everyone is Adulterous," Shi Hui's acting skills have undoubtedly become fixed. Someone once said that the Shen Yang he directed in "Mother" is Shi Hui's own shadow. The elementary school principal in "Middle-Aged Woes," with the help of the script and director, also broke through the stagnant line and caught up with Mr. Sang Hu. The heroine Zhu Jiachen is said to have been seen by the director as the third sister in "Big Reunion," and he asked for her help out of friendship. The character of Liu Minhua has been powerfully visualized under her superb performance, especially the scene where Shi Hui proposes to her, which is the climax of the whole play, and also the climax of the performance. She exposed the enthusiasm latent in her heart without any forced or excessive feeling. We should have great expectations for the rise of this new screen star.

The story of "Middle-Aged Woes" is about the joys and sorrows of a middle-aged man. He has abundant vitality, but his environment forces him to be an old man enjoying his old age. This forcibly suppressed emotion finally erupts, and he gives his remaining vitality to society. The playwright sarcastically explains here that the general attitude of middle-aged people to spend their years in leisure is a waste of life. He uses Liu Minhua's dialogue to convey his idea: "At your age, you have knowledge and experience, which is the most mature stage of life. It is a pity not to make good use of this stage!" (General idea) Finally, "Chen's Cemetery" was changed to "Chen's Elementary School," and a new little life was born at the same time. Chen Shaochang said: "I feel that my life has just begun, just like him." This is an even more powerful revelation.

"Middle-Aged Woes" is a refreshing, fluent, connotative and powerful good play.

### ### Silver Dollar Inscription

— Pi Ji

A currency is not judged by its size (referring to the gold yuan certificate), but by its value; a head is not judged by its newness (referring to the Sun Yat-sen small head), but by its ability to be large. This is a silver dollar, only its quality lasts long. After many years of not showing its whiteness, it suddenly meets Qing again; there are wealthy people who manipulate it, and no poor people who collect it. It can tune the zither and strengthen the nerves. It sounds pleasant to the ear, and saves the trouble of devaluation. It is used to being close to doors like the sea, and fears seeing rooms like pavilions. Scholars say: What silver is there! (Moved to help education)

### ### Bleeding

— Xin Xiu

People who have money to speculate often say: "Out with silver, in with gold," or "Out with gold, in with banknotes." Between this buying and selling, silver and gold yuan roll in "without any effort."

We poor people are unlucky, we have neither gold nor silver, we have nothing to take out, only bleeding, sweating. All day long, we bury our heads in exhausting our minds, this is invisible blood; even more pitiful are those milkmaids who abandon their own children to feed other people's children; and those who give blood to patients in hospitals are truly bleeding.

Wedding and funeral invitations fly to your desk one after another, forcing you to take out your wallet to "give gifts as etiquette." That is also a kind of hard injury bleeding!

### ### Various Lighthouses

— Zhang Qing

Working in a lighthouse myself, I happened to read the erroneous descriptions of lighthouses by writers and poets, and I often laugh to myself when I recall that I used to have such errors. This is probably because the institution of the lighthouse is too unfamiliar to the general public.

In the imagination of ordinary people, the light emitted by the lighthouse at night is enough to illuminate the dark sea around it like daylight. In fact, this is not accurate. Although the light emitted from the lighthouse has a luminous power of hundreds of thousands of candlepower, it is only a "signal." You probably don't believe it, but in the lighthouses on remote islands, they only use a few ordinary kerosene lamps to spend the night. The establishment of the lighthouse was originally for the navigation of ships traveling on the distant sea, so the light emitted by the lighthouse is parallel to the sea surface, neither upwards nor downwards, so the people inside the lighthouse cannot share any light.

Since the lighthouse is a navigation mark, although there are many lighthouses in the world, the shape, height, and color painted on the exterior of each tower are different. For navigators, these differences are a great convenience. At night, the light emitted by each tower is also different, not only the time of flashing light and dark is different, but some lighthouses also emit several colors of light to increase the vigilance of navigation. Navigators use these individual characteristics of the lighthouse to measure and calculate the accurate position of their ships.

When we open the map, we can see that almost all routes pass through many large and small islands and headlands, as well as reefs and bright rocks scattered around. These are the biggest enemies of maritime traffic, they are like lurking demons and sea monsters, with the ambition to devour ships at any time. In the daytime, navigators can avoid dangerous places by the different shapes of the islands, but at night, it is like "a blind man riding a blind horse," without any guarantee, and there is danger of causing trouble everywhere. If a navigator cannot find an expected lighthouse when sailing at night, his anxiety is beyond words. Because "a miss is as good as a mile," one mistake could be the end of the ship. Therefore, the lighthouse is nothing less than an angel of navigators, and these angels guarantee the safety of navigation. Some lighthouses are equipped with radio, radar, fog horns, signal cannons, and other devices. When the fog rises and navigation is dangerous, they immediately sound an alarm to warn passing ships, so that they will not be at a loss and cause a major disaster.

Because most lighthouses are located on dangerous and remote islands, the staff who work on these remote islands to release light and send out warnings on time live a rather lonely and arduous life. These remote islands are rarely visited by people in peacetime, and once the wind and waves rise, the transportation between the remote islands and the outside world is completely cut off. At that time, what the staff face day and night are the turbulent waves in front of them and the ruthless sand and rocks under their feet. —Written at the North Island Lighthouse in Penghu
