### Mao Zedong's Reply Telegram to Acting President Li, Clarifying Standards for Peace Negotiations, Expressing Wish for Early Agreement to End War and Restore Peace, Premier He States Government is Currently Considering

[This Newspaper's Report] Communist Radio last night at 10:00 PM broadcast the exchange of telegrams between Li Zongren and Mao Zedong. This is the first time the Communists have released news regarding peace negotiations since the government's peace delegation went to Peiping on April 1st for peace talks. The broadcast first relayed the full text of Acting President Li's telegram to Mao Zedong from Nanking, followed by: "Xinhua News Agency Commentary: Li Zongren's telegram still contains many self-aggrandizing tones, boasting about his own influence, which is quite amusing. The so-called 'Kuomintang-Communist cooperation' is nowhere to be seen, which makes people feel uneasy. But fundamentally speaking, under the supervision of the people of the whole country, Li Zongren seems to have increased some sincerity in hoping for the success of peace. Whether this is the case, we shall see in the future." Afterwards, Mao Zedong's reply telegram to Li Zongren was released. The original text is as follows: "To Mr. Li Delin of Nanjing: I have received your telegram of the seventh (April). The Chinese Communist Party's position on the current situation is fully expressed in the statement of January 14th this year. Since your side agrees to take the eight conditions as the basis for negotiations, then it is not difficult to obtain a correct solution by seeking concrete realization based on these eight principles. The issue of war criminals is also the same. The standard is whether it is conducive to the advancement of the Chinese people's liberation cause and whether it is conducive to resolving domestic problems through peaceful means. Under this standard, we are prepared to adopt a lenient policy. When I met with Mr. Zhang Wenbai (Zizhong) today, I told him this. For the liberation of the Chinese people and the independence of the Chinese nation, for an early end to the war and restoration of peace, so as to facilitate the great work of starting production and construction on a nationwide scale, and to enable the country and the people to steadily enter a state of prosperity and happiness, it is urgent for both of us to establish a peace agreement as soon as possible. The Chinese Communist Party is very willing to join hands with all patriotic elements in the country and strive for this great goal. Mao Zedong, April 8, 1949."

[This Newspaper, Nanking, 9th] After Mao Zedong's reply telegram to Acting President Li was broadcast by the Communists at 7:00 PM on the 9th, Acting President Li read the full text at 10:00 PM and expressed great satisfaction.

[Central News Agency, Nanking, 9th] After Xinhua News Agency broadcast the news of the Communist Mao Zedong's reply telegram to Acting President Li on the 8th, Premier of the Executive Yuan He Yingqin, when asked by the press on the evening of the 9th about his feelings on the reply telegram, said: "It is still under careful consideration."

### Frequent Meetings in the Capital, More Personnel to be Sent to Peiping, With Zhang Qun and Yu Youren as Most Likely Candidates

[This Newspaper, Nanking Dispatch, 9th] In order to promote the rapid success of the peace talks, the government may continue to send high-ranking officials to Peiping to assist the peace work from the side. It has been learned that the candidates and the number of people for this position were initially mentioned in the important consultations at the Acting President's official residence on the afternoon of the 9th. However, the opinions of each individual still need to be formally solicited separately on the 10th. It is said that the number of people is two, with Yu Youren and Zhang Qun being the most likely candidates. Tong Guanxian and Ju Zheng are also candidates under consideration and whose opinions will be solicited. As for the speculation that the Acting President will go in person, sources close to the President stated: This is not possible.

[This Newspaper, Nanking, 9th] High-ranking officials are gathering in the capital, and meetings are frequent, indicating that the overall situation will have new developments in a day or two. Related sources revealed on the evening of the 9th that what government officials are most concerned about at present is not only the situation of the peace talks in Peiping, but also the attitude of Guangzhou towards the peace talks. Zhang Qun returned from Xikou, and the opinions he brought back are also being given special attention. Although the Central Standing Committee held in Guangzhou agreed to establish a Peace Negotiation Steering Committee in Nanking, it is still questionable whether the committee has the power of final decision. In view of this situation, Acting President Li urgently summoned high-ranking officials in various places to return to Nanking. He Yingqin and Bai Chongxi arrived in Nanking on the 8th and immediately participated in the gathering at the Acting President's official residence. On the morning of the 9th, Yu Youren, who was in Shanghai, was invited to return to Nanking in a hurry. Zhang Qun, who went to Xikou to seek instructions, also rushed over at noon on the 9th. On the 9th, Acting President Li had individual talks with various high-ranking officials in the morning and afternoon. At 3:00 PM, he convened important consultations with high-ranking officials in Nanking. He Yingqin reported on the trip to Guangzhou on the spot, particularly emphasizing the resolution of the Central Standing Committee, the attitude of high-ranking officials in Guangzhou, and the general situation in Guangzhou. Zhang Qun reported on the situation of his trip to Xikou, and then discussed the peace talks and related issues for a long time. The content is unknown. Those who attended the meeting refused to disclose any information, but the content of the meeting was indeed very important. In addition to He's report, the Acting President also discussed the peace talks in detail, and Xu Yongchang and Gu Zhutong gave detailed reports on the Jiang Defense. It is said that the meeting was mainly studying Zhang Zhizhong's report in recent days. Those who attended the meeting included Yu Youren, He Yingqin, Tong Guanxian, Ju Zheng, Wu Zhongxin, Zhang Qun, Zhu Jiahua, Bai Chongxi, Xu Yongchang, and more than a dozen others.

### One of the Three Mysterious Guests, Liu Ziheng, Arrives in Shanghai

[This Newspaper, Nanking, 9th] The three mysterious guests from Peiping who once aroused the interest of political figures in the capital have been identified by reporters after days of interviews. Their names are Liu Ziheng, Li Minxin, and Zhu Yunshan. Li and Zhu were both listed in the statement on the current situation issued by Li Jishen and 55 others on January 22. They have added great mystery due to various objective conditions. However, after the reporter learned their names, everything became clear. Moreover, Liu Ziheng, the most mysterious of the three guests, took the Nanking-Shanghai night train to Shanghai at 11:00 PM on the 9th. According to Liu, before his departure, he told reporters that this trip was "visiting friends" and would return to Nanking after staying in Shanghai for one day. According to the English broadcast of the Communist Radio on the evening of the 9th, Li Jishen will be the mediator for any comprehensive peace talks.

### Difficulties in Reporting on the Progress of Peace Talks in Peiping, Zhang Zhizhong Replies to Reporters in Nanking and Shanghai

[This Newspaper, Nanking, 9th] The peace talks being held in Peiping are the focus of attention across the country, but because the Communists have declined reporters' requests to go and cover the event, and there are no news reports or broadcasts, little is known about the progress of the peace talks. Reporters in Nanking and Shanghai have, through the government delegation, requested the Communist representatives to provide news for daily publication, to be telegraphed to Nanking for announcement. It has now been learned that Zhang Zhizhong has replied by telegram to Nanking, stating that "there are many difficulties," so in the short term, there will be no direct reporting on the progress of the peace talks.

### The Communists Criticize Zhang Yaoming

[This Newspaper Report] In last night's Communist Radio broadcast, the Nanjing April 1st incident was used to vehemently criticize Zhang Yaoming, the commander of the capital garrison, pointing to Zhang as the direct person responsible for this bloodbath, and saying that he was slaughtering students under the instructions of President Chiang. It also pointed out that the recent statement issued by the Garrison Command was "utter nonsense, creating slander, and should be punished with an even heavier crime." Finally, it stated that if Zhang Yaoming did not immediately "redeem his sins by meritorious service," the new Communist troops would cross the Yangtze River and advance south, and would "execute the will of the people" and punish Zhang. In addition, it also claimed that Chiang's "reactionary clique" continued to persecute students in Nanking, Taiwan, Wuhan, Fuzhou, Chengdu, and other places, prohibiting parades and demonstrations. Students are still being threatened with slaughter. At the same time, it was also said that Xinhua News Agency reporters had interviewed democratic figures in Peiping, who expressed serious protests against this incident. Li Jishen stated: "This incident has made the people of the whole country greatly doubt the Nanjing reactionary government's sincerity in seeking peace. If some figures in the Nanjing reactionary government really hope for peace, they should immediately and completely break away from the Chiang Kai-shek clique, severely punish the murderers of the people, release all political prisoners, and side with the people." Shen Junru of the China Democratic League stated: The Nanjing April 1st incident proves that the government lacks sincerity in peace talks.

### Peace Talks Haven't Started Yet, Zhang Zhizhong and Mao Zedong Had a Long Talk the Day Before Yesterday

[This Newspaper, Nanking, 9th] The formal meeting of the peace talks had not yet started on the 9th, but extensive exchanges of opinions before the meeting were frequent. This action also had a significant effect on the formal meeting, and some problems that could become a deadlock were also sought for a unified approach during this exchange of opinions. On the evening of the 9th, reports were received here in Peiping, confirming that there had been considerable progress in recent days.

[This Newspaper, Nanking, 9th] Zhang Zhizhong, the chief representative of the government's peace delegation, had his first long talk with Mao Zedong on the 8th, with very good results and a good meeting. Zhang sent a detailed telegram of the contents to Acting President Li on the 9th, but this telegram had not been received by noon on the 9th. The above situation was reported by Zhang Zhizhong in a telephone call from Peiping to the Acting President on the afternoon of the 9th.

### Bridgeheads North of the Yangtze Continue to Fall, Dagger Island Pier Once Lost then Recaptured, Communist Troops in Southern Section of Peiping-Hankou Railway Continue to Advance South

[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 9th] The situation at Sanjiangying, facing Zhenjiang, is unclear after two days and nights of artillery fire on the 9th. On the Yangliu Line, from Zhujiaqigan to Laosiwei, the Communist troops continued to fire from morning to noon on the 9th, seemingly with the active intention of seizing Liuwei. After the Guazhou on 12th Island were reinforced by the National Army, the situation turned stable, but about 10,000 troops from the 207th and 209th detachments of the Communist 8th Corps, which had gathered in Yizheng, formally attacked 12th Island on the 9th. The defending troops have joined forces with the Weihai warship stationed at 12th Island to fire back. Also, the Communist troops who occupied Shijiaqiao and Sanmeihe on the 8th and launched a fierce attack on Liuwei are the Bohai Column and the 7th Garrison Brigade, totaling about 10,000 people. The air force has been constantly flying low along the northern bank of the Yangtze River for reconnaissance on the 9th.

[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 9th] Official news: The Communist Bohai Column recently sneaked from the Tianchang area to the area south of Yangzhou and north of Sanmao River. The Communist troops are still in the Jiaojiadang and Xiannvmiao areas north of Sanjiangying. The 23rd Army is in the area south of Taixian and north and east of Kou'an. The main force of the 28th, 29th, and 31st armies have sneaked to the area around Nantong, Rugao, and Hai'an. It is judged that the Communist troops on the opposite side seem to be in conspiracy to cooperate with the Communist central political offensive, and will exert extensive pressure on the bridgehead positions on the north bank of the Yangtze River to increase their momentum.

[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 9th] The military authorities stated: The offensive launched by the Communist troops in northern Jiangsu this time is a planned action. Although bridgeheads such as Yizheng, Siyuangou, Sanmao River, and Shijiaqiao have been captured, the National Army has close cooperation and defense by the army, navy, and air force, so it is still impossible for the Communist troops to cross the Yangtze River.

[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 9th] The Zhen-Gua line resumed navigation on the 7th, with two ships per day, carrying more than 3,000 passengers and refugees to Guazhou. When proceeding towards Yangzhou, the Communist troops attacked the National Army, and more than 30 civilians were killed or injured under the ruthless artillery fire.

[This Newspaper, Changshu, 9th] The battle situation in northern Jiangsu is extremely tense, and all bridgeheads are under increasing pressure. Siyuangou and Shijiaqiao, south of Yizheng, have also successively withdrawn. It is reported that the Communist Bohai Detachment has arrived in Yangzhou, Jiaojiadang, Xiannvmiao, and other places. The 28th and 29th armies have been transferred to Nantong, Rugao, and Hai'an. The 23rd Army is gathering in the area south of Taixian and north of Kou'an. The frequent mobilization seems to have the intention of crossing the Yangtze River. The National Army on the south bank has made all preparations. There is no concern about the Yangtze River defense.

[Central News Agency, Nanking, 9th] Military News: (1) The 36th Army of the Chen Yi's Communist troops in Jiangbei attacked and captured Yizheng on the evening of the 7th, and then attacked and captured Dahekou on the evening of the 8th (Northwest direction of Longtan across the Yangtze River). Since these two places were captured by the Communist troops, the Communist artillery fire will threaten the safety of the Nanking-Shanghai railway traffic. However, at present, under the close surveillance of the National Army's army, navy, and air force corps, the Communist troops have not been able to exert the power of their artillery fire. (2) Near Gaowang, north of Jiangpu, there were continued small battles on the morning of the 9th. A small group of Communist troops, about 500 people, attacked and harassed the south, but were quickly repelled. (3) The Communist troops who captured the Sanmao River north of Guazhou on the 8th have now been identified as the 7th Garrison Brigade of the Communist troops. The Communist troops continued to attack Shijiaqiao at about 7:00 PM on the 8th, and are currently fighting the National Army north of Guazhou. (4) The 20th Army of Chen Yi's Communist troops attacked our Sanjiangying bridgehead position at dusk on the 8th, and then captured it at 8:00 PM. Currently, the National Army in that area is holding near Longwo and fighting fiercely with the attacking Communist troops. Also, Gaoqiao (Sanjiangying South across from Dagang) was attacked by more than 3,000 Communist troops at 12:00 noon on the 9th. The defending troops fought bravely and are still fighting fiercely.

[Central News Agency, Nanking, 9th] Military News: (1) The 30th Army of Chen Yi's Communist troops attacked the Liangshan, Yuxikou, and Erba areas across from Wuhu to Jiangxi on the evening of the 8th. The fierce battle continued all night. By dawn on the 9th, the Communist offensive had been slightly thwarted. Currently, each bridgehead is standing firm, and the National Army is still firmly defending the original position, confronting the Communist troops. (2) The Dagger Island pier was captured by a part of the 27th Army of the Communist troops, about 1,000 people, at 4:00 AM on the 9th, and was recaptured by the National Army's counterattack at 6:00 AM. They are currently still confronting each other.

[This Newspaper, Jiujiang, 9th] The 11th Army of the Communist troops suffered heavy losses in the Anqing battle and is undergoing readjustment and replenishment. The Communist troops taking over the defense are the 10th Army of Liu Bocheng's troops, which moved south from Tongcheng. There are no changes in the 15th Army originally in Susong and Taihu.

[This Newspaper, Jiujiang, 9th] The Yong'an warship returned to Jiujiang from the Anqing front line on the 9th for refueling and will return to the front line within days to cooperate with the Anqing garrison. The reporter visited the warship immediately after it arrived at the Xun shore and learned that a total of × warships from the Navy participated in the Anqing battle this time, commanded by Commander ×× in the command warship, achieving brilliant results. However, the naval soldiers were slightly injured due to fighting on the deck. When the reporter visited the Yong'an warship, there were no less than 20 places on the ship that were damaged by heavy Communist artillery. Because the Jiang surface near Anqing is narrow, the widest Jiang surface is only 2,000 meters. In particular, the Anqing Xia Yangjiatao and Baota had no less than 30 machine gun battles with the Communist troops, inflicting heavy losses on the Communist troops.

### The Actual Work of Agricultural Loans

— Zhang Huamin

Although the government is currently facing significant financial difficulties, it still plans to issue substantial funds this year to continue providing agricultural loans. To the impoverished farming masses who believe the government has historically only "taken" from farmers and never "given," this is indeed a piece of heartening good news. On the eve of the imminent opening of these agricultural loans, the experiences and lessons learned from past work in this area should be thoroughly studied to avoid repeating past mistakes. Based on my personal observations in practical work, I offer some suggestions for the consideration and reference of those concerned about agricultural loan issues.

First and foremost, the simplification of procedures is essential. In the pre-war period of stable prices, rural farmers often purchased goods using a "credit system." Farmers and shops had frequent dealings, and regardless of the amount owed, everything was recorded in a ledger. Debts were usually repaid on time, and "bad debts" were as rare as "phoenix feathers and unicorn horns." The extent to which farmers emphasized credit can be seen from this. Currently, the complexity of procedures and the multitude of forms involved in agricultural loans focus entirely on formality, neglecting the farmers' actual needs and rigidly adhering to unrealistic principles set by superiors. This improper tendency can be bewildering even to the educated, and how can the so-called "illiterate" common people, when they go to the "magnificent" agricultural loan offices and face the "arrogant" bank staff, not "hesitate" and "shrink back" when confronted with the dazzling array of forms? Moreover, when agricultural loan groups receive loans, they must prepare seals and business plans, and the seals must be signed by key personnel. Most farmers are so-called "blank slates," unable to recognize even basic characters like "man," "hand," "foot," "knife," and "ruler." How can they "sign" on exquisitely printed seal papers using snow-white laid paper? How can they draft grand plans? The only option is for the guidance staff to create and draft them on their behalf, resulting in repetitive and useless documents.

In addition to the above forms, there are also application forms, contracts, detailed lists of member loans, registers of members' cultivated land, and copies of member loan agreements. How can these complex forms not give a headache to the so-called "simple-minded" farmers? If agricultural loan institutions claim to be "financial institutions for the common people," they should adopt a style that reflects this. Agricultural loan forms should be reduced as much as possible to provide convenience for farmers!

We believe that if agricultural loans are used by individual farmers, only a contract and a detailed list of loans are needed. The official seal on the seal paper and the signature of the key personnel at the back of the detailed list are sufficient. The group seal is already affixed to the detailed list of the agricultural loan group; why is a separate one needed? The "loan amount" on the application form is already in the "total" column on the detailed list, and a column can be added to the detailed list for the "loan term," thus rendering the application form unnecessary.

As for agricultural loans for collective management, except for larger-scale operations that require a realistic and feasible plan and loan documents, a simple letter stating the type of operation, method, and amount needed, with the official seal of the key personnel at the back, is sufficient for small-scale operations in rural areas after a thorough investigation and the drafting of a loan agreement. All seal papers, application forms, registers of cultivated land, etc., should be eliminated.

Secondly, the loan amount must meet the farmers' needs. In the past, agricultural loan personnel were welcomed in rural areas because of the large loan amounts. When agricultural loan institutions handled the last batch of agricultural loans last year, some loans were as low as ten-odd yuan in legal tender per mu (at the time, about five cents in alloy coins). The maximum loan amount per person was over two million yuan in legal tender, only about seven jiao (seventy cents) in alloy coins, which was less than one percent of the farmers' actual needs at the time. Therefore, agricultural loan personnel were scolded everywhere they went. Even if agricultural loan groups such as cooperatives and farmers' associations still nominally existed, farmers would demand the return of shares and membership fees and immediately dissolve the agricultural loan groups as soon as agricultural loan personnel explained the loan amount per mu. This was nominally for the development of farmers' groups and cooperative organizations, but in reality, it was destroying cooperative businesses and farmers' groups!

According to farmers, they could earn about six million yuan in legal tender for a day's work, which was enough to buy meat and alcohol. However, to receive agricultural loans, they had to attend meetings for the establishment of cooperatives today, committee investigations tomorrow, and loan disbursement the day after. They had to pay for their own food at the meetings, did not receive wages, and had to pay membership fees. In the end, they only received a few hundred thousand yuan in legal tender, which was not even enough for half a day's work. It was simply a joke. At the time, agricultural loan personnel were truly embarrassed and ashamed and had no words to say. It was a major satire on agricultural loan institutions. We believe that during periods of inflation and unstable prices, agricultural loans must be adjusted according to local needs to adapt to farmers' actual production costs, using reasonable methods.

Thirdly, there is the issue of interest rates. Financial institutions must rely on deposits to exert their power. The interest rate on agricultural loans was determined by the former Fourth Joint Office to be 7.5 per cent per month, but the interest rate on deposits is still only 3 per cent per month. Now, interest rates on the black market sometimes reach 1.5 to 1.6 yuan, making agricultural loan interest rates seem too low! We know that before the war, most of the agricultural loan funds came from absorbing idle funds from various places. In the current situation of rampant inflation, why would people deposit funds, which are practically "gifts" obtained from printing institutions, for a negligible profit of about 3 per cent per month? As a result, agricultural loan funds largely rely on issuance as a source, which is a serious mistake!

The level of interest rates depends on the supply and demand of funds in the market and the coordination with current economic conditions. If supply exceeds demand, it will inevitably decrease; conversely, if demand exceeds supply, it will inevitably increase. Forcing restrictions through political power may be effective for a time, but it cannot be sustained for long. Currently, agricultural loan institutions should consult with the competent authorities to offer deposits in silver dollars, gold, and other commodities, determine interest rates based on market realities, absorb large amounts of idle social funds, and provide them with safe guarantees and reasonable profits to give them legitimate outlets and avoid their use for hoarding, speculation, and manipulation. This would increase the source of agricultural loan funds!

The issue of agricultural loans is originally part of the entire China problem. It cannot be separated from the influence and control of the actual social environment we face and must be coordinated and developed in conjunction with the reform of the entire political economy for it to be smoothly and successfully executed. In the current environment of constant artillery fire and widespread conflict, where everything is not on track, we have no reason to demand that agricultural loans be handled to the point of perfection alone. The promotion of any work cannot be segmented; it requires vertical continuity and horizontal links. However, if the shortcomings of the past are not corrected when handling a matter, how can we talk about overall reform or progress?

### Rising Prices Intensify, Markets in Various Regions are Chaotic, Liu Gongyun Summoned to Beijing Tonight

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Amid the soaring prices and gold notes, Finance Minister and President of the National Bank Liu Gongyun has been summoned by Premier He and is scheduled to take the night train from Shanghai to Beijing on the 10th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The prices in Nanjing suddenly skyrocketed on the 9th, and the market was extremely chaotic. This phenomenon was due to the fall of Yizheng, which tightened the military situation, and the issuance of salaries by a certain transportation agency on the 9th, which also promoted the rise of gold notes and silver dollars. The price increase on the 9th was led by gold notes, reaching its peak around noon. Gold reached a maximum of over 3.7 million per tael, US dollars 86,000, silver dollars 80,000, and rice also broke the 400,000 mark. The Wuyang market was also full of rising prices. At that time, most shops were unable to grasp the situation and found it difficult to operate, so many closed. The situation eased slightly after 4 pm and only slightly recovered by the evening.

[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 9th] Prices were affected by the spread of the war on the north bank of the Yangtze River, rising sharply across the board, and the markets became even more chaotic. The grain market was closed and lacked supplies. Outside the market, white japonica rice has broken through the 300,000 mark. Cotton yarn also set a high of 10 million, a rise of 40 to 50 per cent compared to yesterday. The common people are crying out in hardship. Flour is 90,000, soybean oil is 1.8 million, wheat is 320,000, and white wheat is 371,000.

[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 9th] The Fuzhou market was unprecedentedly turbulent on the 8th, and prices were frightening. Shops refused to use bank drafts. By 6 pm, the entire city had become a dead market. Fortunately, Zhu Shaomin took emergency measures with an iron fist, selling rice and China Textile cotton yarn to recover bank drafts, instructing the Chamber of Commerce to maintain the circulation of bank drafts, and strictly ordering the military police stationed in Fuzhou to restrain their subordinates and ensure public order. By noon on the 9th, the market gradually recovered, and prices began to fall.

[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 9th] Here, in the past three days, due to the flooding of bank drafts, the market continued to soar on the morning of the 8th after the previous two days. Rice opened at 260,000 and broke through the 300,000 mark at noon. The situation changed dramatically in the afternoon, and asking prices reached as high as 500,000 to 600,000. Most rice shops hid their rice, and those holding bank drafts could not buy rice. However, those holding gold to buy rice could still exchange one qian (approximately 3.125 grams) of gold for one shi (approximately 100 liters) of rice. Other markets were also like the buying frenzy of last October. Before 3 or 4 pm, it was still possible to buy goods with bank drafts, but the prices of goods priced in gold changed rapidly. After 3 pm, most shops refused to accept bank drafts or gold yuan notes, so many shops closed early. Gold opened at 2.67 million per tael in the morning, reached 3.5 million at noon, and 4.5 million in the evening. Gold shops only bought and did not sell. Silver dollars were quoted at 100,000, but there were no transactions. Citizens ran around in fear and could not describe their feelings. It is reported that national and provincial banks issued salaries for civil servants, teachers, military police, and employees for March starting from the 6th at 2,700 times the original amount, due to the shortage of currency. The issuance of 5,000, 10,000, and 50,000 bank drafts was temporarily printed, and by today, the banks have issued approximately 7 billion to 10 billion in total. This immediately flooded the market,搶購gold,钞票, and物价, triggering涨风and escalating into an unmanageable situation within three days.

[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 9th] The Chengdu market has entered a state of madness, and the rise in prices is extremely rampant. On the 9th, rice was 240,000, gold was 2.45 million, and silver dollars were 35,000. Other goods such as yarn, cloth, general merchandise, tobacco, and sugar are also increasing rapidly, with an average increase of more than ten times the beginning of the week and 10,000 times that of August 19th. The price of living essentials changes almost ten times a day.

### Lanzhou's Monetary Conditions Tighten, Embezzlement and Escape are Frequent

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 9th] Lanzhou's monetary conditions are tightening, and the market is unusually chaotic. Spot cash is discounted at 250 yuan per day, and silver dollars are discounted at up to 1 per cent per day, but they are still not easy to obtain. Dozens of cases of embezzlement and escape occur every day, and some people are even committing suicide by drowning. The money position is particularly tight. Banks and financial institutions are issuing excessive cheques, leading to frequent disputes. The Central Bank will investigate and restrict this. In the past ten days, the Central Bank has transported approximately 5 billion in cash to Lanzhou, and another 7.5 billion has been allocated to Xining, Jiuquan, Tianshui, and other places. However, the payment needs of public and private institutions and the national treasury will require more than 40 billion. The cash transported is less than one-eighth of the total needs, so bank drafts can only be used to cope with the situation. If no cash continues to arrive in the coming days, the currency shortage will become even more severe.

### Yunnan Provincial Government Resolves to Borrow Silver Dollars to Pay Salaries

[Our Kunming Dispatch, 9th] Since the Yunnan Province approved the free circulation of semi-minted silver dollars, the price of silver dollars has been rising every day.

[Our Kunming Dispatch, 9th] A major corruption case has recently occurred at the Kunming Branch of the National Taxation Bureau. The newly appointed Director, Lan Wei-de (younger brother of Lan Ni), after being ordered to adjust the tax rates, contacted the Da Yun Tobacco Factory and sold them a large number of tax stamps. The factory then sent a reward fee of 11,000 silver dollars, which Director Lan personally withdrew from the Guangyu Bank. After the Regional Bureau's supervisor noticed this, the branch staff was deeply indignant. The staff requested an emergency loan, but it was denied, causing widespread anger. They requested a thorough investigation and strict punishment. The newly appointed Director of the National Taxation Bureau of Yunnan and Guizhou, Zuo Zhisheng (nephew of Xu Kan), did not express his attitude towards this, and many believed that this case had strong backing and would be difficult to resolve satisfactorily.

### East-West Cold War Enters New Stage - Acheson Emphasizes Three-Power West German Agreement - Does Not Close the Door to Four-Power Agreement

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 8th] U.S. Secretary of State Acheson declared at a press conference tonight that the signing of the Atlantic Pact and the Three-Power Agreement on Germany are attempts to establish a foundation. We hope to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union on this basis. Acheson pointed out that the Atlantic Pact and the Agreement on Germany have greatly strengthened the position of the Western Allies, not only in their attitude towards Europe as a whole, but also in international issues related to the Soviet Union, which will have a significant impact. Acheson declared that the U.S. attitude towards the Berlin Blockade has not changed. The U.S. does not intend to start negotiations with the Soviet Union until the blockade is lifted. He emphasized that there is nothing secret about the Three-Power Agreement on Germany from the Soviet Union, and it does not prevent the Soviet Union from eventually joining the agreement if it wishes.

[Reuters Washington, 8th] French Foreign Minister Schuman hosted reporters today and emphasized that the possibility of a Four-Power Agreement on the German question still exists. It is now the Soviet Union's turn to show whether the West German example can be applied to all of Germany. He believes that the Three-Power Agreement on West Germany provides a perfect basis for future action on Germany. He repeatedly emphasized that the agreement does not conflict with the possibility of a Four-Power Agreement, and the next step in this regard will be taken by the Soviet Union.

[Reuters Washington, 8th] Secretary of State Acheson stated at a press conference today that the U.S. government advocates that the High Commissioners stationed in Germany after the establishment of the German Federal Republic should be non-military personnel, and the number of occupying forces will also depend on general security needs.

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 9th] U.S. diplomatic circles here are optimistic about resuming Four-Power negotiations on the German question in the near future. Their reasons are based on the moderate attitude taken by Soviet representatives at Lake Success, and the remarks made yesterday by French Foreign Minister Schuman and U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, emphasizing that the Three-Power Agreement on Germany does not conflict with the Four-Power Agreement, and only requires the Soviet Union to lift the Berlin Blockade. Another factor that makes people optimistic is that the three powers are limiting the use of veto power by the High Commissioners stationed in Germany to important issues. This indicates that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France do not want the Soviet Union to feel that once a Four-Power High Commissioners Council is created, it will still be monopolized by the veto power of the Western countries. Finally, U.S. officials pointed out that Soviet representative to the UN, Gromyko, seems to be trying to hold informal contacts with U.S. diplomats at Lake Success. They believe that the main content of these informal talks will be the German question and the Atlantic Pact question.

### Key Points of the Three-Power Agreement on Germany - Military Administration to be Abolished Upon Establishment of German Government - High Commissioner's Office Established to Supervise

[United Press Washington, 8th] The Foreign Ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France issued a joint statement this afternoon stating that complete agreement has been reached on German issues. As soon as the new German government is established, military administration will be abolished in the occupied areas, and the three countries will only retain limited administrative power. The military governors will be replaced by High Commissioners, but the occupying forces will continue to be stationed.

The agreement was reached during what British Foreign Secretary Bevin called "one of the most important weeks," indicating that the long-term dispute between the three powers over Germany is coming to an end, and Germany will soon return to the international community. The key points of the Three-Power Agreement on Germany include the following: (1) Revise the occupation regulations to simplify the original regulations. The new regulations stipulate the relationship between the United States, the United Kingdom, and France and the new German government. The full text has not yet been published and will be submitted to the West German Constitutional Assembly in Bonn. (2) As soon as the new German government is established, the military government will be abolished in West Germany, and a High Commissioner's Office will be established, consisting of one High Commissioner from each of the three countries, responsible for supervising the new German government. The occupying forces will continue to be stationed, each under the command of its own commander. (3) The German government can freely handle national affairs, except in certain circumstances where the three countries retain power, such as preventing the revival of German militarism and maintaining basic relations between Germany and foreign countries.

In addition, the three Foreign Ministers also agreed on methods for dismantling factories, restricting industries, and internationally controlling the Ruhr area. Unless the Allied powers retain power, any resolution passed by the German government can be implemented three weeks later, unless it is rejected and disapproved by the three High Commissioners, in which case it will be invalid.

### Judd Agrees with - Stassen's Advocacy of Aid to Asia - Accuses Washington of Consistently Prioritizing Europe

[United Press Washington, 9th] Representative Judd, a Republican who is a strong advocate for aid to China, came out on the 9th to preside over Stassen's "MacArthur Plan for Asia." Judd agreed with the opinion expressed in an editorial in the Minneapolis Star Tribune that the plan should not be named the MacArthur Plan, but rather the "Marshall Plan for Asia." Judd told United Press that regardless of the name of the plan, its content is the most important thing. He said: "MacArthur has always advocated treating the Asian problem as a whole, but Washington has always ignored it and, on the contrary, instructed MacArthur to pay attention to Japan." He said: "However, the success or failure of MacArthur in Japan will depend on the situation in Asia. If Asia becomes communist, Japan will also become communist. I know that MacArthur is eager to make the State Department recognize that East Asia must be seen as an organic whole, just like Western Europe, but the State Department seems to think that the same theory does not apply to Asia. They value Europe but abandon Asia, adopting different policies in Europe and Asia."

### On Handling Italian African Colonies - Soviet Representative Explains Position - Still Insists on Adopting Joint Trusteeship System

[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 9th Broadcast: In today's UN Political Committee, Soviet Representative Gromyko explained the Soviet Union's position on handling Italian African colonies, still insisting on adopting a joint trusteeship system. Gromyko said that this move is in line with the suggestion made by U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes at the Four-Power Conference in 1945. According to the views of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France at the time, the distance between opinions was very far, except that a part of Eritrea should belong to Abyssinia. Gromyko also suggested that Libya be allowed to gain independence after ten years. During this period, the region should be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations, with an administrator to manage it. In addition, a consultative committee composed of European and Arab residents from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, Italy, and Libya should be organized to assist the administrator in handling all administration. Gromyko then severely criticized the United Kingdom's unilateral decision to hand over the Mellaha Air Base in Tripolitania to the United States for use, believing that the United Kingdom had no right to make this decision.

### Soviet Union Exercises Veto Power for the 30th Time - Prevents South Korea from Joining the United Nations - South Korean Representative Accuses Soviet Union of Malicious Action

[United Press Washington, 8th] The Soviet Union today vetoed South Korea's application to join the United Nations in the UN Security Council. Soviet Representative Malik pointed out that the South Korean government is a U.S. puppet and violates the will of the people. U.S. Representative Austin replied that South Korea is actually a peace-loving country. Representatives from China and Canada also supported South Korea's membership. The result of the vote was nine to two, with the Soviet Union and Ukraine voting against. The Security Council resolution requires only seven votes for legal voting, but the entire case was rejected due to the Soviet Union's veto. This is the 30th time the Soviet Union has exercised its veto power.

[United Press Lake Success, 8th] Zhao Bingyu, South Korea's chief representative to the United Nations, issued a statement immediately after the Soviet Union exercised its veto power to prevent South Korea's application to join the United Nations, denouncing the Soviet Union's "abuse and improper use of veto power." The statement said, "I believe that this action by the Soviet Union insults the Korean people and is another malicious fact that obstructs the activities of the United Nations." He continued, "The only reason is that the Soviet Union is determined to control and occupy the Korean peninsula in order to make it a strategic base for the Communist Party's policy of conquering the world."

[United Press Lake Success, 8th] South Korean representative Zheng Huanfan said today that the Soviet Union's exercise of veto power over South Korea's application to join the United Nations organization is a malicious action and insults the South Korean people. The Soviet Union's motive for this move is nothing more than to use and occupy all of Korea as a military base to carry out the Communist Party's policy of conquering the world.

### Royal Points Out My Situation - Hinders Japan's Restoration - Situation in Korea Also Increases Difficulties in the Far East

[United Press Washington, 9th] Former Secretary of the Army Royal recently reported to the House Appropriations Committee, mentioning the situation in China. The original statement was released today, stating that the situation in China makes our country's problems in the East more complicated. China's raw materials are used by Japan less and less, and the sales of Japanese-made products in the Chinese market are shrinking. This situation will hinder Japan's economic restoration, which we are working hard to achieve. The unstable situation in Korea also increases difficulties in the Far East. Under these circumstances, MacArthur hopes to send more troops to the Far East, but we cannot effectively increase the number of troops stationed in the Far East. The U.S. occupying forces in Japan, Korea, and Okinawa number about 135,000. The morale of the U.S. military is generally very high.

### Cominform Maliciously Slanders - Southern Leader Sternly Reprimands

[Reuters Belgrade, 9th] Southern Prime Minister Marshal Tito delivered a speech to the Third Congress of the Yugoslav People's Front today, stating that Yugoslavia cannot follow in the footsteps of the imperialists. The Southern country is building socialism and has achieved great success. It is a mistake for all war profiteers and reactionaries in capitalist countries to speculate about Yugoslavia because of the status of the Southern country today and the attitude of Eastern European countries towards the Southern country. On this point, the attitude of the Southern country has always been consistent. Tito talked about the Cominform's attacks on Yugoslavia, saying that the more intense these attacks, the more resolute the Southern people's revolutionary will to resist. The Cominform's propaganda is not Marxist, and it not only harms the reputation of socialist methods, but may even have unimaginable consequences for the world's revolutionary development.

The Republican Party's attempt to cut the original plan's funding in half was first rejected.

[United Press Washington, 9th] The $5.8 billion aid to Europe reconstruction bill, after being passed by the Senate by a vote of 70 to 7, was transferred to the House of Representatives today, which will hold a special meeting to discuss it. Leaders of both the Democratic and Republican parties have predicted that the bill will be quickly passed and is expected to be put to a vote next Monday or Tuesday.

The House Committee reduced the first item by 50 million yuan and rejected the third item, totaling a reduction of 200 million yuan, but the government can guarantee private investment of 272 million yuan.

[United Press Moscow, 8th] A Labor Daily editorial today stated that the Philippines is still a U.S. colony. The United States inspects Philippine newspapers, and U.S. films and propaganda spread throughout the Philippines.

### Railway Bureau Automatically Adjusts Fares: To Be Implemented from the 13th: Increase of Approximately Five Times More Based on Approved Calculation Method

[Our Dispatch] The Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) Railway Bureau will, starting on the 13th of this month, following the Yuehan (Guangzhou-Hankou) Railway Bureau, automatically adjust fares (Note: the Yuehan Railway already automatically increased prices on April 4th). The extent of the increase is still under final consideration. It is reported that if calculated according to the calculation method approved by the Legislative Yuan, the basic passenger fare will be 208 yuan and 37 fen per kilometer, and the freight fare will be 277 yuan, 8 jiao, and 5 fen per kilometer, an increase of more than five times compared to the current fares.

This is the second time the two railways have automatically adjusted fares. The last time was after the major strikes on both railways, because the salaries of the employees of the two railways were changed to be converted from the market price of rice, and they had to increase fares to maintain a balance of payments. Subsequently, in February, a formulaic adjustment began to be implemented. Although there were repeated coal shortages, the railway bureau was able to purchase in batches or ask the Central Bank for advances to manage, barely maintaining operations. However, since April, the Legislative Yuan has stipulated that railway fares be adjusted monthly, making it impossible for fares to keep up with rising prices. In recent weeks, prices have risen wildly. The gap between the railway bureau's income and expenses has widened. Since March 11, coal prices have risen twelve-fold, rice prices have risen seven-fold, while railway fares have risen only two-fold, making it impossible to purchase coal for daily train operation. The salaries of employees for March have not yet been settled. The director of the bureau, Wang Zhaohuai, went to Nanjing the other day to report the current situation of the two railways to the Ministry of Transportation and the necessity of automatically increasing prices.

### Wang Zhaohuai Issues a Statement: Describes the Difficult Situation

Wang returned to Shanghai yesterday and told reporters: "Although the fares of our railway have been adjusted repeatedly, they are still difficult to compare with general prices. The recent adjustment on April 1st was only approved to increase by one time, which was already inconsistent with reality. It has not been ten days yet, and prices have risen even more wildly, making the gap even greater. The two most important items for transportation costs, coal and rice, are particularly severe. Our bureau needs at least 21,000 tons of coal per month, which is coordinated by the Fuel Management Committee, with foreign coal, Kai-luan coal, and Taiwanese coal supplied in batches. Foreign coal was 99,864 yuan on March 11, and today (April 9) it is 1,270,800 yuan, an increase of 12.7 times. Kai-luan coal was 91,542 yuan on March 11, and today it is 671,500 yuan, an increase of 7.4 times. Taiwanese coal was 83,220 yuan on March 11, and today it is 415,720 yuan, an increase of 5 times. Our bureau's passenger and freight fares have only increased by two times for passenger transport and 2.4 times for freight transport from March 11 to today. In order to maintain the livelihoods of employees and keep the railway running smoothly, our bureau, following the orders of the Ministry of Transportation, calculates salaries based on rice units. Although the burden is greater, it is a necessary burden to ensure that employees can work with peace of mind. However, the price of white rice was 36,500 yuan on March 11, and today it has reached the 300,000 yuan mark. The disparity between expenditures and income is truly alarming. In desperation, on the one hand, we borrowed coal from the Central Bank for emergency relief, and on the other hand, we requested subsidies from the Ministry of Transportation. However, when the coal is returned, it must be settled according to the coal price on the payment date. Before the subsidies arrive, a certain amount is allocated from the daily operating income, which is a drop in the bucket and has become a situation that can never be repaid. For example, our bureau requested a special coal fund of 3 billion yuan on March 15, and 1 billion yuan was approved on March 21, but the fund was not allocated by the Central Bank until April 8. At that time, it could purchase 7,564 tons of coal, but when it was received, it could only purchase 1,089 tons. For more than two months, we first worked hard to stabilize the lives of employees and maintain transportation order, and then we spent painstaking efforts to raise both black and white food rations. As of today, 40% of our bureau's employees' salaries for March have not yet been paid, and the fuel coal will run out by the 14th of this month. The Ministry of Transportation's subsidy for April is as much as 7 billion, but it has not yet been allocated. When it is allocated, it will be used to pay off old debts of more than 5 billion. If the time is too late, I am afraid it will be more than this number. Therefore, our bureau's financial difficulties have reached the brink of collapse. In view of the importance of transportation on both railways, I will naturally do my best to maintain it. However, the difficulties of the situation are such that I hope people from all walks of life will understand."

### Xingguo Road Improvement Project: Has Been Fully Completed

Xingguo Road in this city is one of the main north-south connecting roads in the western district. It was originally an unfinished dirt road.

The City Council once resolved to repair and pave the road, but the project could not be carried out due to a shortage of funds. Recently, the Public Works Bureau, in view of the increasing number of houses on both sides of the road and the large number of vehicles passing through, used the materials in the bureau's stock to piece together and build police well gratings and side ditches on the road with great effort, and added a coal cinder pavement. The project is now fully completed.

### More Than 20,000 Regular New Recruits: Must Be Collected Within the Deadline

However, so far, the collection work has not yet started due to the impact of the settlement allowance for new recruits. It is learned that because this city is a commercial and industrial hub, the conscription method is divided into two types: regular and reserve. The regular quota is 23,000, which must be collected within the specified deadline for paying soldiers. The reserve quota is 14,000, which will be collected when necessary. The recruitment quota will be deducted from the reserve quota. The age of eligible men to be conscripted this year is those born in the 13th to 17th years of the Republic of China, i.e., those who are 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25 years old.

(2) Cancel the method of paying salaries according to the previous period's index. In principle, salaries must be paid according to the current period's index. The method will be submitted to the general meeting for discussion, and the general meeting will be convened before the 15th of this month.

In February of last year, Shen Yufang took the police entrance exam and had no documents. He asked Xiao to forge a transfer certificate, which Jiang filled out and stamped. Later, the Ministry of Education found out and sent it to the Municipal Education Bureau for investigation and prosecution by the District Prosecutor's Office. When District Court Judge Ou Shenghe opened the trial yesterday morning, both defendants were present and blamed each other for the forgery. However, the court pointed out that since the school was only founded three terms ago, the defendants proved that "the student had studied in the third grade of the junior high school of the school in the 36th academic year and passed the first semester examination," which clearly constituted forgery of documents. Xiao Zhenpei was sentenced to three months in prison for forging student graduation certificates, and Jiang Beishan was sentenced to two months in prison for helping to forge certificates. The court also reprimanded them, and the two defendants left in shame.

### Another Trunk Murder: Corpse of Child with Wounds Found on Rue Ratard

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday morning at 8:30 AM, a large, ownerless old leather trunk was discovered near the entrance of Lane 556 on Rue Ratard, within the jurisdiction of the Jing'an Monopoly Bureau Police Station. A female child's corpse, approximately four years old, was retrieved by a patrol officer and taken back to the branch station. Director Wang promptly telegraphed Chief Forensic Pathologist Liang Hanfen of the General Bureau to come to the scene for examination. The girl was wearing red corduroy pants, a beige cotton undershirt, coffee-colored floral socks, and light yellow corduroy cotton shoes. Her upper body was wrapped in a white gauze window curtain, and a dark navy blue vest was placed beneath the corpse. Dr. Liang thoroughly examined the child's body and found blood in her nostrils, as well as purple and blue bruises on her abdomen, buttocks, arms, and forehead, suggesting injuries inflicted by adults. Additionally, there were blue marks on her thighs and calves, as if from being beaten with a stick, and her abdomen was distended. The forensic pathologist deduced that the girl had been subjected to constant torture by adults before her death, and ultimately suffocated after being wrapped in a cotton blanket. It is suspected that she was abused to death by a stepmother. The branch station is currently dispatching officers to investigate the details and hopes that neighbors or relatives of the child will confidentially report any information to the Criminal Division of the branch station, so that the trunk murder case can be solved as soon as possible.

### Good Intentions Lead to Unexpected Disaster: Two Young Men Sentenced for Robbery

[Our Dispatch] Shi Zhang Xuezhi, a Ningbo woman residing at No. 25 Hengan Lane, Yongjia Road, is from a wealthy family. This Lunar New Year, Zhang Yaohui, a young man from the same hometown, along with his friend Yang Jun, came to offer New Year greetings. Shi, considering that Zhang and his companion were lodging in expensive hotels in Shanghai, extended hospitality out of hometown fellowship and invited them to stay at her home. They departed on the fifth day of the New Year. Unexpectedly, on the night of February 22nd of this year, two masked, ochre-painted robbers suddenly appeared at Shi's home and stole valuable jewelry, including a 1.40-carat diamond ring, a gold anklet, two pairs of pearl earrings, three gemstone rings, and other miscellaneous items. Afterwards, Shi realized that the robbers were intimately familiar with the layout of her house and remembered the earlier incident. She reported it to the Municipal Police Bureau, which dispatched officers to Ningbo, where they, together with the Ningbo police, arrested the two robbers, Zhang and Yang. After interrogation, their guilt was confirmed, while another principal culprit, Zhu Shijun, escaped after hearing the news. The case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution.

Zhang and Yang burst into tears upon hearing the verdict, appearing deeply remorseful. It is reported that both Zhang and Yang are very young and come from families that are not particularly poor.

### Gunfire in the Middle of the Night on North Zhongshan Road: Barking Dogs Awaken Owner, Single-Handedly Repelling Multiple Robbers, Dozens of Shots Exchanged, No Fatalities or Injuries

[Our Dispatch] Tao Fulin, a 28-year-old local resident and military officer at the Supply Station of the Air Force Supply Headquarters at Dachang Airport, resides at No. 1 Taojiazhai, North Zhongshan Road. Around 1:45 AM yesterday morning, Tao was suddenly awakened from his sleep by loud barking from his dogs. He got up and looked out the west window, discovering two figures by the bamboo fence to the north, climbing over it. Tao shouted, "Who's there?" In response, the other party immediately drew a gun and aimed to fire. To gain the upper hand, Tao immediately drew his handgun and fired a shot in the direction of the assailants, who then retreated. He then looked out from a window to the north and saw six robbers with handguns, ammunition boxes, and other weapons waiting. After the first two robbers crossed the fence, they opened the gate to let them in. At that moment, Tao, without regard for his own safety, fired his gun again. The robbers immediately returned fire, and the two sides exchanged dozens of shots for ten minutes. Due to the darkness, it was difficult to aim, and there were no fatalities or injuries. Finally, the robbers scattered into the darkness, fleeing into the jurisdiction of the nearby Dachang Branch Bureau. Two officers, Nos. 7740 and 7551, stationed at the police kiosk in that area, saw people passing by in the middle of the night and ordered them to stop, but they did not comply. The officers then fired eight shots from their rifles, none of which hit. All the robbers escaped. Afterwards, upon receiving the report, the Zhabei Police Bureau, under the command of Director Zhang, ordered Section Chief Jiang Ying to supervise inspectors Wang Shusheng and Rui Wenzhen, along with a large number of detectives in plain clothes, to drive to the scene in police vehicles to pursue the robbers. The robbers had already fled far away. Only one hand grenade, one bullet, and four shell casings were found under the bamboo fence. These were taken back to the branch station and sent to the General Bureau for examination. A search for the escaped robbers is underway.

### Invoking Souls on the Grassland! (Part 1): Photographer Zhan Jinshui's Posthumous Diary Reveals the Mystery of the Sanguoluo Incident

— Xiao Sai

"Where can pure customs be found in the Central Plains? In ancient times, all races were united. For thousands of miles, the Qiaolin traveled endlessly. The horse-headed mirror enters the silkworm bushes."

(Xie Wuliang's poem when Zhan Jinshui bought the western travel grassland)

Since the desertion to independence in the spring of 1948 by Kang Guangming, a Sanguoluo officer, who requested the provincial government to demarcate the boundary between Western Sichuan and Qinghai Province, Ma Bijie was made head of the comfort corps, creating the "Sanguoluo Incident" of the Sichuan border issue. The relatives of the victims in Rong are fighting for the repayment of the blood debts of Zhan Jinshui and others.

Sanguoluo is located in the Yellow River Basin, south of the Bayan Har Mountains, at the foot of Mount Jishi. It is a mysterious grassland in western Sichuan, rich in products, with rare "uranium" existing, placer gold all over the river, and magnificent scenery, but it is all controlled by officers and local Buddhas, who consider it a treasure of the mountain. Even Renault was tempted to go there.

Departing from Rong: The matter is as follows: On April 10th, photographer Zhan Jinshui and others, who participated in the comfort corps, set off from Rong. The companions included doctors Liao Hongdao and Mo Kunqi, and Liu Shican from the Frontier People's Guidance Office. They gathered in Guanxian and Songpan to prepare for departure. Veterinarian Wang Kaiyuan and several translators were added, and dozens of Tibetan soldiers were dispatched, flying the yellow flag with the "Ma" character and carrying guns. Commander Ma, a Han official, also prepared a reclining chair, a marching bed, a radio, and a chef, intending to flaunt Han power in front of the barbarian tribes in the Damowa area.

Later, they crossed the Yellow River from Aba and reached their destination, Gongmasang.

From Zhan Jinshui's diary (which was fortunately brought back by his nephew, who survived the ordeal), we can see the whole picture of the "Sanguoluo Incident" and the truth of the incident.

"April 16th, departed from Guanxian, 16 sedan chairs, a mighty formation like a long snake. Light rain, a hint of cold in the mountains. 17th, passed Niangzi Ridge, 18th, passed Feisha Pass, 19th, passed the cable bridge, inspection very strict, no passage allowed without a pass. Crossing Qipan Pass and Wenchuan, the mountain road is rugged, the city is as small as a dipper, chicken feather shops are everywhere. Banqiao Pass, 20 miles from the city, was the site of the battle between General Li Jiayu and the Communist Party in the 24th year of the Republic of China. Now this western Sichuan battlefield is full of broken tiles, ruined walls, and overgrown weeds. 20th, arrived at Maozhou City."

"The next day, Commander Ma and I went to the commissioner's office (Zhan Jinshan was the secretary of the comfort corps and a photographer for the Universal Pictorial) to visit Commissioner He, talking about their expedition's experience in the grasslands last year, and his tireless struggle against the opium bandits; and this Heishui area is still difficult to thoroughly clear up to this day."

Jinshui was quite naive. He wrote, "I used to be a skinny person, but now I'm fat, which shows that travel life can also help the body and mind." Who knew that he would later be killed, truly making human affairs difficult to predict.

Songpan Sounds "May 29th, everyone is busy preparing to depart for the grassland. Commander Ma is like a troupe leader, wondering how to keep the show going. The funds allocated by the provincial government, from Songpan to Sanguoluo, will be used to transport the entire troupe in just four days. I wonder what trump card Commander Ma will use? Will he dig into his own pocket to complete this great mission? Everyone believes that Chairman Wang will definitely add a lot to the funding. Cattle and horses are all gathered at the county bank. The advance team departs from the north city in a mighty fashion. Troupe leader Ma Bijie is still frantic to raise silver dollars. The water in Songpan is hard. The small business owners who started with black and white have enough prestige to make the troupe leader suffer."

"Following the Jinhe Dam and turning right into the Chuanzigou, officers lined up to see us off, and a string of firecrackers echoed in the empty valley. June 1st, the mountains and rivers were rugged, and we left Huangsheng Pass. The temperature had dropped to 40 degrees. The last Han-style feast, mounting horses, I tore my trousers while riding a horse, at the disadvantageous Jiapo plain, where I had to sew my own trousers that night."

"Heading north to Hamafan and Haji fan, the road is full of yellow flowers, Guanyin willows, growing all over the mountains and rivers, as well as dog tongue flowers and four-petaled red orchids, etc. Asking the Tibetans, they don't know the name of this place anymore, suffering the draughtsmen Wu Pingzhang, Kang Keming, and Tie Zhenxi, who are all gathered here. Twenty-odd tents. I think that when Liu Huangshu was in the Liaoying camp, it was only like this. The horse bells outside the tent rang in the wind, and I remembered the story of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang hearing the bells in the rain during his exile in Shu."

Settling in the Basin "On the 4th, crossing Zheboba Zhi (meaning foot of the mountain) and crossing Zheboba Mountain, as soon as we entered Niangjiakan, it was completely grassland. The water is below, the grass is above. If cattle and horses are not careful, they will fall into the mire. The pioneers circled around to find a way. My little donkey fell into the mud. Ropes were used for rescue. Both people and horses felt strenuous. Although the Eight Trigrams Formation is said to be magical, I think it is definitely more difficult to ride on this grassland. Overnight at the first pasture in Mohei. These places are not governed by any government. The previous expedition did not give them face and even stole horses and guns. On the 7th, we passed Aqiu Gengka Se Er Ya Kou River, and on the 8th, we arrived at Aji Gongkang, the site of the ancient battlefield of Sanguoluo. Cypress trees grow on the bright red soil. It is said that if a local destroys a branch, the whole family will die."

### Jiangyin Fortress Chief Commander Wu Guangwen Flees in Fear of Punishment

[Our Dispatch from Wujin, 8th] On the 29th of last month, eleven privately owned cargo ships, fully loaded with military supplies such as kerosene, gasoline, and paper, secretly took the Houqiao route to Sanjiali, Shitougang, where they were seized by soldiers of the local fortress garrison command. The garrison commander, Wu Guangwen, was initially deceived, and the unscrupulous merchants offered him 30 taels of gold as a bribe to let them pass. They initially paid in gold rings, gold nuggets, etc., totaling six taels of gold, and the remainder was redeemed with multiple pieces of cotton yarn. Wu Guangwen tacitly agreed to let them go, and the eleven cargo ships secretly left the port that night and went elsewhere. Soon after, Fortress Commander Dai Rongguang received a secret report and discovered the matter. Dai immediately placed Wu Guangwen under surveillance. At the same time, the stolen goods, including gold and cotton yarn, were seized. On the 6th, the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the First Pacification Zone jointly formed a military-political inspection team and arrived in Cheng. Commander Ding also came to Cheng to inspect the coastal defense. Commander Dai immediately transferred the entire case to the inspection team for interrogation. While the investigation team's inspection group was beginning to question him, Wu Guangwen suddenly fled without a trace. The inspection group has now ordered Commander Dai to arrest the fugitive and bring him to justice.

### Nanxun: The Silent Village (Part 2)

— Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

Decline of the Silk Industry: The reason for the decline of the Nanxun silk industry is the lack of improvement. When the American tour group came, there was no silk factory. The Americans were very surprised. Later, they learned that each person produced their own homemade silk. Homemade silk cannot be standardized, and the density and individual pieces are not uniform, which is not ideal. Mr. Zhang, the chairman of the Nanxun silk industry association, told the reporter: "The reason for the decline of the Nanxun silk industry is because the original silkworm species have been lost. According to the Japanese method, the original species are preserved by the state, and hybrid species are initiated by the people. If we do not preserve the original species and only raise improved species, then the improved species will come from foreign countries. Foreign countries know that China is a formidable competitor, so naturally they will not give us good species. In addition, farmers sell cocoons in order to earn more money beyond the cost, so they bring the cocoons down the mountain before the 'precious reality' of silk spinning is complete, in order to increase the weight." Yes, the reporter also encountered cases where government-funded cocoon traders and silk factories deliberately lowered the price of cocoons to collect them. Therefore, in order to encourage the raising of good silkworms and the spinning of good silk, we should generously give prices and not let cheap cocoons lead to sick farmers and then sick silk.

Gentle Water Village: The reporter went to Nanxun to investigate in late March of this year. The population of Nanxun before the war was 35,000, but now it is only 18,000. Most of the tall houses were destroyed by fire. There is a Nanxun Middle School, 15 elementary schools, a nursery, and a public hospital. Lin Liyuan, the young and capable headmaster of the middle school, hired the writer Xu Chi as the director of academic affairs. They both told the reporter: "The commercial and salt transport of Nanxun is actually bureaucratic capital, and now that it is officially sold and transported, it is declining. The pawnshop industry exploits the poor and is gradually declining. Only silk can be improved and progressed, and strive for glory on the international stage." I told Brother Xu Chi: "Nanxun has a very good environment, it is a cultural and gentle water village, especially silk is famous internationally. It is best to add a silkworm research department to the school to cooperate with the improvement of Nanxun silk." He said that he loved his hometown the most, that private, quiet, and comfortable place, and his hometown can only work hard in the silk industry. Several of us went to Xiaoyunzhuang for a tour. The window lattices and railings of the pavilions and buildings there are mostly dilapidated, but looking at the overall layout, we can still see the luxury of the past. Adjacent to Xiaoyunzhuang is the Liu family's library, which we also visited. The place where the books are stored has been sealed off, fearing theft by criminals. It is said that it contains more than 100,000 volumes, including the Yongle Encyclopedia, of which there are only 24 copies in the country, and this building contains 18 copies. In the past, the Zhejiang Provincial Library came here to copy them by hand. Outside the library building, there are pavilions, gardens, flowers and trees, a quiet environment, just a good place to cultivate one's nature and read books.

Return Home and Work Hard: According to Brother Lin Liyuan, "Most of the rich people in Nanxun now have gone to Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places because they can't bear to see the ruins of the empty village, but to revive the place, build the hometown, and make silk famous abroad again, everyone must come back and work hard."

He also told the reporter, "Mr. Zhang Jingjiang, who had the most constructive spirit in the past, is now recuperating in New York, and his eyes have become blind. He originally wanted to return to China, but because the situation was unstable, he did not plan to return."

Yes, Nanxun had its historical status in the past, but now it appears desolate, ruined, silent and lonely. "Silent loneliness is unbearable." We must cheer up, break through this loneliness, and restore Nanxun to prosperity!

Letter: Recently, Mr. Xue Housheng, an engineer and reader of this newspaper, wrote to us stating that in the article "The Treasures of Zhejiang - Fluorite Mines" by reporter Huang Xingtian of this newspaper, there is a slight supplement regarding the 82% of the total fluorite output used as a smelting solvent for iron. He said that fluorite is also known as fluorite (originally named Tlourite, or Tlourspar). Its main use is in metallurgy (such as steel, antimony, lead, aluminum, iron, manganese, copper, gold, silver, etc.), but 82% of the total output should be aluminum smelting solvent. The most urgent need in our country now is the Taiwan Aluminum Industry Co., Ltd., which is most urgently needed. I would like to have it published as above.

### Tragic Love Killing in Nanchang: Hardworking Female Student Wu Qiyun Dies Under a Sharp Blade; Killer Hong Min Talks Openly About the Murder After Being Arrested

[Our Dispatch from Nanchang, 6th] A tragic love killing recently unfolded in the northern residential area of Nanchang City, by the bank of the Yan Gong Temple River in Xiashawo. The female protagonist in the case was hardworking student Wu Qiyun. After the case was discovered, the killer Hong Min was arrested by the police and confessed to the murder process without concealment.

The female protagonist Wu Qiyun, was 24 years of age, hailing from Jinhua, Zhejiang. She possessed a beautiful appearance and slender figure and graduated from Nanchang Women's School.

She was a pitiful child who lost her father. When she was ten years old, her father passed away, leaving her and her mother behind in this city. When the Japanese army invaded Nanchang, her mother took her to Qingjiang to take refuge. Afterwards, they moved to Taihe, where prices soared and life became difficult. Wu took to copying for others, earning meager profits in order to support her mother. Later, Taihe also became precarious, and the mother and daughter relied on each other and fled to Jishui, less than a day's journey from Ji'an, to stay temporarily.

While fleeing in Jishui, they met a man named Yan Shuren. Yan, seeing that they were an old mother and a weak daughter, repeatedly used tricks and showed great diligence to Wu, using the excuse of introducing her to work to lure her to the countryside of Ji'an, plotting to hide her away. Wu was alert and took the opportunity to flee home in the middle of the night, fortunately not falling into Yan's trap. After the victory and return, she returned to Nanchang and was admitted to a certain girls' school as a free student, studying hard day and night, and fortunately achieved success.

Recently, Wu's studies at the school were progressing well. One day, she suddenly met a young man named Hong Min on the street, whom she had met in Taihe. They fell in love, and there was talk of marriage, but a change suddenly occurred. Hong Min, hearing rumors that Wu was in love with someone else, became increasingly suspicious of her and eventually distanced himself. Wu did not know that Hong had changed and did not take any precautions. Who knew that Hong's love for Wu had led to a secret murderous intent.

On the evening of the 31st of last month, Hong invited Wu out to watch the movie "Rose of Tralee" at "The Great World." Wu gladly went with him. After the first showing ended, the two strolled together, talking as they walked, feeling very close. Later, they went to the northern city park for a tender conversation. Wu never knew that Hong harbored murderous intentions. When they arrived at the riverside near Yan Gong Temple in Xiashawo, Hong suddenly produced a sharp knife and stabbed Wu violently in the abdomen and head, resulting in her tragic death.

Wu fell to the ground under the sharp blade, lying supine on the riverside. She was discovered the next morning, and this love killing spread throughout Nanchang. The deceased had permed hair, a red hairpin on her right forehead, a short blue-patterned jacket on her upper body, a short coat, blue suit pants, flesh-colored stockings, and yellow leather shoes. Her body was covered in mud and blood, with a three-inch long knife wound in her stomach and an inch-long knife wound on her right forehead. Her hands were clenched tightly, indicating that she had struggled fiercely before her death.

After the incident, the police officers went out to arrest the murderer and obtained clues from the woman's mother. They finally arrested the criminal Hong Min at the South Railway Station. He confessed to the case and the murder process in full detail, without concealment. As for how he will be dealt with, it remains to be examined and reviewed by the authorities.

### Food Rice Resumes Free Trading; Japonica and Indica Rice Nearing the 300,000 Mark

[Report from our newspaper] Rice trading has been deregulated, with price controls lifted and free buying and selling restored as of yesterday. Market transactions have resumed, but due to extreme shortages of supply and robust sales, coupled with the soaring prices of gold and banknotes, prices have skyrocketed. Spot payments for white japonica rice are at $275,000, high-quality rice is at $290,000, and next week's payment terms require $340,000. Spot payments for thin indica rice are at $280,000, next week's payment terms require $340,000, and early rice is at $320,000, all experiencing a sharp increase of 50%. The total supply to both markets is 3,089 piculs.

Another report: Regarding the recent surge in food rice prices, the person in charge of the Social Affairs Bureau stated yesterday: "Recently, gold, banknotes, and all commodities have been rising sharply. It would be unwise to solely suppress rice prices. What the Social Affairs Bureau is paying attention to are: (1) preventing food rice from becoming a target of speculation; (2) preventing the market from using food as a bargaining chip. Two-thirds of the food required by this city is supplied by household rations, and only one-third depends on the market. If food can be reasonably channeled, this city will definitely not experience a food shortage. This city is currently preparing to store food for five months: April, May, June, July, and August. The supply for April has already been secured, and the remaining months' reserves are being gathered."

### Flour Surges; Cooking Oil Skyrockets

Cooking oil prices have skyrocketed, with the situation becoming perilous. The speed of the increase is unprecedented. Raw soybean oil is quoted at $2,000,000, with the closing price at $2,200,000, a rise of 65%. Raw rapeseed oil is at $1,880,000, and drums of raw oil are at $2,100,000, both rising by 60%. Sesame oil and tea oil have both risen by 50-60%. Soybean cakes have also risen by 50%.

Flour market continues its upward surge. The opening market was buoyed by easing credit conditions, with strong interest from all parties. Prices for all brands of flour broke through the $100,000 mark, with the highest price for "Old Car" brand reaching $125,000, and "Battleship" brand reaching $122,000. Some sellers took profits during the session, causing a temporary pullback, but after the closing, the price of gold continued to rise, and sellers strongly increased their premiums to account for two-day interest. Furthermore, with the current situation being highly unpredictable, sentiment is largely bullish, and the market resumed its upward trend. The forward price for "Old Car" brand is $124,000, and "Battleship" brand opened at $119,000, an increase of over 40% from the previous session. Bran quickly followed suit, with large bags nearing the $100,000 mark.

Miscellaneous grains are experiencing an increasingly fierce price surge. Yellow soybeans have surged by 60-70%, with raw kernels breaking through the $7,000 mark. The sesame market is stagnant, with white sesame quoted as high as $600,000. Mung beans are being eagerly sought after by various trading houses, jumping by around 70%. Corn has jumped by 50%, and sorghum by 40%.

### Credit Conditions Loosen; Many Shanghai Stocks Rise to Limit

[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai stock market saw a general rise yesterday due to rising prices of commodities outside the exchange, easing credit conditions, and a glimmer of hope in current affairs news, which boosted confidence.

Wing On Textiles opened at $26, but profit-taking from overnight positions caused the market to soften, dropping to $24.8. Banking and cotton yarn interests actively bought on dips, leading to strong buying interest and a straight upward surge to a high of $29.8. Securities firms and large investors pushed down the price, and short sellers frequently applied pressure from outside the market, causing several dips, hovering around $28.5. Subsequently, the rush to sell gold dissipated, and overnight interest rates opened lower at $35-$40 for Wing On Textiles, benefiting the longs. Strong players resumed buying, causing the market to break through and rise again to $30, but scattered sellers took profits near the close, causing a slight pullback to close at $28.8.

Small and medium-sized stocks opened relatively flat, but as Wing On Textiles repeatedly hit new highs, various parties actively bought, causing them to rise to the limit. Sin Wah rose to the limit at $6.6, New Asia at $2.16, and Taiwan Sugar also rose to the limit at $58,800. Nine other stocks also reached their daily limit, including New China Department Store, Commercial Press, Great China, and Zhabei. Although Ching Foo and Myers did not reach the limit, their gains were also near the maximum allowable. For the next session, Wing On Textiles opened at $31 and immediately rose to the limit. Applications to close trades also rose to a high of $30.02. All other stocks rose across the board. The total daily turnover was 4.3368 billion shares.

### Gold Surges Dramatically

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday's gold market again showed a market with prices but no trading volume. The announcement that the Central Bank would issue silver dollar notes caused excitement among various parties, and prices were bid up to $2,280,000 in the morning, but demand still exceeded supply. The Central Bank did not intervene by selling gold. By noon, transactions remained largely at a standstill. The market was closed in the afternoon due to Saturday.

Another report: Over-the-counter trading remained active, as prices in other locations rose sharply, bringing a flood of positive news.

The morning opened relatively flat at $2,400,000 and $2,450,000. Some long positions were taken, causing a slight drop to $2,370,000 and $2,420,000. Midday, rumors that the monetary system would be reformed caused strong buying interest from Guangdong trading houses and securities firms, pushing prices up to $2,700,000 and $2,730,000. The afternoon closing was slightly lower at $2,630,000 and $2,680,000.

The afternoon saw further gains due to loose credit conditions and generally positive conditions. Prices soared to $2,800,000 and $2,900,000 at the close, with overnight interest of $300,000, pushing quotes to $3,100,000 and $3,200,000, breaking through the $3,000,000 mark and jumping by another $360,000 from the previous day.

Another report: Yesterday, jewelry stores resumed posting prices in the morning, initially quoting $2,350,000 and $2,650,000. Around 11:00 AM, prices rose to $2,500,000 and $2,800,000. At noon, the market became chaotic again, and posting prices was suspended once more, an increase of $450,000 from the previous day. Silver jewelry also rose by $5,000 to $25,000 and $30,000, while money exchange shops suffered losses. The morning quotes were $2,500,000 and $2,700,000, which rose to $2,700,000 and $2,900,000 at noon, and then to $2,800,000 and $3,000,000 in the afternoon.

### Gold Bonds and Foreign Stocks Soar

### Silver Dollars Surge

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday's silver dollar arbitrage was characterized by significant price discrepancies across regions, leading to market confusion and reduced trading volume. Several hundred thousand dollars were arbitraged out of Hankou, Shantou, Chongqing, and Wanxian. Street trading started flat but tightened later.

The morning was relatively stable, with "Big Heads" quoted at $45,000 and $47,000. Soon after, as gold prices jumped again, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and other places reported sharp increases. Sentiment turned bullish, and all parties stopped selling and started buying, causing prices to rise sharply. Before noon, "Big Heads" broke through the $50,000 mark again, reaching $53,000 and $55,000.

In the afternoon, demand exceeded supply, and prices continued to rise. The final quotes for "Big Heads" were $54,000 and $57,000, "Small Heads" were $43,000 and $47,000, and "Eagle Dollars" were $35,000 and $40,000. Promissory note transactions were also bid up to $58,000 and $60,000 in the evening, an increase of $5,000 to $10,000 from the previous day across the board.

Another report: Yesterday, the over-the-counter US dollar market experienced strong buying pressure due to a scarcity of chips. The morning opened at $52,000 and $54,000, falling to $50,000 and $52,000, then rising to $56,000 and $58,000. The noon closing was $55,000 and $57,000. In the afternoon, driven by buying interest, the closing rose to $59,000 and $62,000, with overnight interest of $6,000, pushing quotes to $65,000 and $68,000, another increase of $6,500 from the previous day. Street trading finally quoted $56,000 and $58,000, with all transactions settled in same-day cash.

### Yarn Prices Jump 30%; Cotton Cloth Rises Sharply

The yarn market is experiencing extremely active trading, with a trend toward frenzy. Sentiment is uniformly upward, and buyers are scrambling to purchase. All parties are adhering to a holding strategy, resulting in a surge of over 30%.

42-count Blue Phoenix yarn opened at $17,000,000 and briefly approached the $20,000,000 mark, with the noon closing at $19,500,000, a massive increase of $5,500,000. Other brands such as Golden City and Precious Light are also nearing the $20,000,000 mark. 32-count Silver Moon yarn rose sharply by $4,000,000 to close at $13,000,000.

21-count Double Horse yarn initially started at $8,600,000, reaching $10,000,000 mid-session. By the close, long position holders took profits, causing a slight dip, but the price still accumulated to $9,600,000, a final increase of $2,200,000. All grades of 20-count and below have reached unprecedented new highs.

Stimulated by commodity prices outside the exchange, the cotton cloth market has experienced a sharp rise. Credit conditions have generally loosened, and there is a widespread belief that the future is optimistic, causing market sentiment to fluctuate. Holders are adopting a wait-and-see approach and are unwilling to sell, creating a situation where demand exceeds supply in the market. The closing gains were tremendous, and prices were further increased after the close.

Leading fine cloth rose directly from $285,000 to $335,000, then quickly fell to $274,500, with the noon closing recovering to $325,000. In the afternoon, as it was the weekend, the market stopped trading, but over-the-counter trading surged to $400,000.

Four Gentlemen Brand Yuan Serge opened at $268,000, reaching a high of $320,000. Near noon, it briefly dipped to $264,000 before rebounding, with the final trade at $315,000, and a further increase of $15,000 after the close. A transaction occurred at $380,000 in the afternoon. Because the time for collection and settlement of notes by trading houses was advanced, the morning session trading hours were adjusted from 8:30 AM to 10:30 AM starting yesterday.

### Report of US Gold Transported to Shanghai Cannot Be Confirmed

### Market Ramblings

Comprehensive Price Increases; Numerous Arbitrage Methods

All markets experienced comprehensive price increases yesterday.

The increase rates for gold and US dollars were moderate, while the prices of general commodities surged rapidly, with soybean oil and rice flour leading the way. Timber, hardware, and cotton yarn rose particularly sharply. The price increases for soap and cigarettes exceeded all previous records. Everywhere, there was a chorus of enthusiastic price increases. Remember our words from yesterday.

In recent years, nine out of ten people in general business have been engaging in arbitrage among gold, banknotes, stocks, and commodities. The arbitrage methods are similar to those in the past, except that there were no set patterns in terms of timing; it was all about adapting to the situation. Now, there is an implicit schedule in place, constantly repeating itself.

To list this schedule, we can provide a few examples. For instance, dividing each month into four weeks: A, B, C, and D, in sequence. This leads to arbitrage involving silver dollars and short-term interest, gold and banknotes and products from our own factory, and raw materials and our own factory's stock.

First, let's consider the arbitrage involving silver dollars and short-term interest:

In weeks A and C, silver dollars are released to earn short-term interest. In weeks B and D, the interest is collected and used to buy back silver dollars. We are currently in week B, and silver dollars are jumping dramatically. This type of arbitrage is highly relevant.

Next, let's consider the arbitrage involving gold and banknotes and products from our own factory, which is a way to prepare for employee salaries and cash flow:

In weeks A and C, gold and banknotes are purchased. In weeks B and D, products from our own factory are sold. Because gold and banknotes are purchased in weeks A and C, the products from our own factory are sold to prepare for salaries and cash flow.

This type of arbitrage has a secret. Let's explain it in three points:

(1) Because gold and banknotes are purchased in weeks A and C, the price of gold and banknotes increases significantly, which fuels the price increases in the commodity market during weeks B and D.

(2) By bidding up the prices of goods in weeks B and D, products from our own factory can be sold at high prices. However, the general increase in commodity prices also increases the cost of living, which is like shooting oneself in the foot.

(3) To offset the self-inflicted wound, the gold and banknotes purchased in weeks A and C are used to make up for this loss, and raw materials can also be replenished during weeks A and C.

Let's also consider the arbitrage involving raw materials and our own factory's stock, which is a way to adjust between gold and banknotes and products from our own factory; it can be said to be arbitrage within arbitrage.

Generally:

(1) In weeks A and C, gold and banknotes are bought, and shares of our own factory are sold.

(2) In weeks B and D, products from our own factory are sold, and raw materials are bought.

(3) In weeks A and C, products from our own factory are sold, and shares of our own factory are bought.

(4) In weeks B and D, shares of our own factory are sold, and raw materials are bought.

The specific changes depend on the situation. But there is one important characteristic: gold and banknotes and shares of our own factory are placed in opposing positions and handled flexibly.

Products from our own factory and shares of our own factory are placed in complementary or mutually restrictive positions and handled accordingly. The purchase of raw materials is placed on the utilization of other people's capital and only listed in the arbitrage transactions for timing purposes.

However, such arbitrage is based on the premise of "national prosperity and people's security". In the present situation, no one can say what changes will occur after a single night's sleep. Therefore, long-term and short-term strategies must be skillfully managed. Take care of yourselves.

### A Division A Football Match: Railway Defeats Ching Wu in a One-Sided Game

[Report from our newspaper] In the second-round match of the Division A football league between Railway and Ching Wu, held at Yiyuan at 3:30 PM yesterday, Railway defeated Ching Wu 4-1 in a one-sided game. Railway scored three goals in the first half, while Ching Wu did not score. Fan attendance was poor, with fewer than 2,000 spectators.

Although the Ching Wu youngsters fought bravely and diligently, they lacked experience and skill. They missed scoring opportunities, and their weak defense was a major problem. Railway won easily in the first half, scoring three goals in the first fifteen minutes. The offensive slowed down slightly in the second half, and they scored one more to make it 4-0. Ching Wu finally scored a penalty kick in the last few minutes to break the goose egg, ending the game 4-1.

Referee Zhang Le blew the whistle to start the game, and Railway attacked first. Xiao Ziwen dribbled down the left and passed to Lu Qingxiang in the center, who headed the ball but was stopped by Chen Huimin. Fan Benjun cut in, and Zhuang Xin's shot went high. In the 17th minute, Cao Liming crossed, Lu Qingxiang darted in, Chen Huimin came out of the goal to meet him, and Xiao Liuzi headed the ball into the empty net, scoring the first goal, 1-0. Ching Wu counterattacked, Fan Benjun went deep along the side, and Yue Renxiao blocked it into a corner kick. Fan Benjun took the corner, which landed in a good spot, but Wu Jingren was a step too slow, missing it by a hair's breadth. Soon after, Ching Wu attacked again, and Wu Jingren's shot hit Liao Xiong's hand, who caught it cleanly. Railway's Sen Dianyi ignited the fire on the sidelines, passing into the center, Lu Qingxiang headed it on, and Qu Xigen flashed in and headed it in, 2-0. In a short while, Lin Yuyang feinted again, dribbled past Huang Lipu, and passed it to the front of the goal. Qu Xigen stepped up, sending the ball into the net, ending the first half with Railway leading by three goals. After a short break, the game resumed, with Railway's Qu Xigen substituted by Fei Chunlin. Railway continued to press hard, and Fei Chunlin crossed the ball, which Xiao Liuzi headed into the net, but it was ruled offside. The two sides fought hard, and the stalemate lasted for a long time. In the 23rd minute, Lin Dianyi seized an opportunity to lob the ball, and Xiao Ziwen headed it in, 4-0. After that, Railway did not press further, and Ching Wu desperately attacked. Railway retreated to defend, and Gao Baozheng fouled in the penalty area in the 38th minute. Wu Jingren took the penalty kick, scoring and breaking the goose egg. As the sun set, the final whistle blew, and Railway defeated Ching Wu 4-1.

### Post-Match Commentary on the Railway vs. Jing Wu Game

Prior to the match between the Railway team and the Jing Wu team, it was widely predicted that the Railway team would win. However, the young players of the Jing Wu team are full of vigor, and their fighting strength should not be underestimated. Early in the match, they managed to force a draw against the Qing Bai team, but their weakness lies in their lack of experience. Their performance is sometimes exceptionally good, while at other times it falls far below par. If their performance is consistently up to par, it will not be difficult for them to become an ironclad army in the future. In yesterday's match, the young Jing Wu players got off to a good start, but after losing three goals in the first half, their morale collapsed, and they could not muster any further energy. In the first goal, Lu Qingxiang headed the ball into the net, due to Yu Qi and Huang Lifu's lack of defense, and Chen Huimin's eagerness to rush out, leaving an open goal. In the second goal, Huang Lifu lingered too long in the penalty area, allowing Lin Dianyi to steal the ball and cross it, which Qu Xigen took advantage of. The third goal was similar to the first two, all caused by mistakes on the part of Jing Wu, allowing the Railway forwards to seize the opportunity to attack and score. Only the fourth goal, where Lin Dianyi crossed the ball and Xiao Ziwen headed it towards the left side of the goal, was one of the most beautiful scenes in the entire match.

It is said that most of the Jing Wu players had just participated in the track and field meet and were exhausted, which affected their fighting spirit. Yu Qi, the backbone of the Jing Wu team, on whom they rely as their impregnable fortress, is a leading track and field athlete at Daxia University. He arrived to play in the match showing signs of fatigue, which dampened the morale of the entire team. Goalkeeper Chen Huimin still seemed restless and distracted. Gao Zhiwen was better. Huang Lifu lingered too long with the ball, which is a major taboo for inside defenders. Chen Zhigang is improving daily, and both wings, Fang Renqiu and Fan Benjun, posed a threat. Fang Renqiu's right-footed cut shot, although it did not break through the enemy's goal, was enough to frighten Liao Xiong. Center forward Wu Jingren, facing national player Gao Baozheng, was forced to become useless. He could only hope for the goal.

Qu Xigen of the Railway team put in a particularly strong performance, scoring two goals on his own, which is commendable. Although his face was bruised and swollen from a collision, he left behind a glorious page, which he will surely savor in retrospect. Gao Baozheng, sitting in the center, made the young Jing Wu players retreat. Lu Bingsheng was sturdy and good at fighting, mowing down all who stood in his way. Cao Liming worked tirelessly. The reason why the Railway team was able to maintain its advantage throughout the match was that its defensive line was particularly strong, making it difficult to distinguish between them. From this, it can be seen that a strong defensive line makes it easier to break through the opponent's defense and achieve victory, and its importance cannot be ignored. Goalkeeper Liao Xiong was agile and repeatedly saved dangerous shots. Wu Jiabang, reassigned as an inside defender, was also quite impressive. Yue Renxiao's courage was as good as ever. On the forward line, Xiao, Lu, and Zhang were the most outstanding of the three musketeers. Zhang Jie's darting shots had the flavor of Han Longzhang. Xiao Ziwen paved the way and sought opportunities, and Lu Qingxiang threaded the needle, all demonstrating the power of the three center forwards. Lin Dianyi was good at concealing his weaknesses, always passing the ball to the center and not attempting to cut in. Facing Yu Qi, the exhausted Jing Wu stalwart, he was unable to stop the central breakthrough attack, which made him particularly useful. Fei Chunlin was not used to playing wing forward, so on several occasions, at critical moments in front of the goal, he kicked the ball wildly in an unknown direction. However, with his physique, speed, and kicking ability, he is capable of playing wing forward, and if he trains specifically as a wing forward in the future, he may achieve something.

### Officialese

— Qu Chen

I haven't been out for a long time. A few days ago, I went to the North Station for some matters concerning my hometown. I saw two public notices at the station, which I found quite thought-provoking.

One of them, posted at the gate of the North Station, was a lost-and-found notice from the Jinghu Line Police Department. It roughly stated: "Approximately 1,000 gold yuan notes have been found. The owner may submit a written statement clarifying the location and time of the loss, as well as the exact amount, and after providing a guarantor, may claim the item at this office." The date was March of the 38th year [of the Republic], with the specific day left blank. We will disregard this for now and focus on the fact that it has been several days since March. I wonder: if this notice was posted at the beginning of March, then 1,000 or so gold yuan notes, with this set of claiming procedures, would not be too unprofitable. However, if it was posted in late March, then the Police Department would be making too much of a fuss. What is a mere thousand gold yuan notes? Why bother posting such a large notice and requiring such complicated procedures for claiming? I believe that even if the owner actually saw it, he would not be moved to such a degree. Perhaps, on the contrary, he would give a knowing smile, expressing his apology for failing to live up to the good intentions of the Police Department.

The other notice stated that passengers needed a vaccination certificate to purchase tickets. When I saw it, I couldn't help but rejoice, because I had just been vaccinated a few days earlier, and I wouldn't be rushed at the last minute. However, when I handed in my vaccination certificate and the fare together at the window, I never expected that the clerk inside would throw it out dismissively. I noticed that other passengers didn't have this requirement at all and were able to buy tickets as usual. I suddenly realized that no wonder the vaccination stations outside were so empty. I felt a little ashamed and too clueless.

These two notices were deeply imprinted in my mind. I thought to myself: rather than being called public notices, they are simply decorations for the North Station. However, I was a little hesitant, because they are, after all, official notices.

### The Best Cake

— Translated by Jin Daqin

When I was a child, our family was often so poor that we had no food at all. But we still lived happily, because Mother always told us with deep conviction that we would eat very well tomorrow.

One winter, my father was working away from home for a long time, and my mother worked in a textile factory. She worked the night shift, so she could still take care of some family affairs during the day. Every evening, when she went to work at the factory, she would always leave a note telling us what food was in the house and how we should handle it.

At that time, Mary (my sister) had already graduated from junior high school and was working at a telephone company. After school, I also went to work at a transportation company for a few hours, where my brother Tite also worked. Only my younger brother George was often at home. We often felt that our family was too fragmented, and it was rare for the siblings to have the chance to meet. Only on Sundays did Mother bring the family back together.

One day, the note that Mother left read: "There are four eggs in the cupboard, and you can each eat one. Tomorrow is my birthday, and we will celebrate it well."

George was the first to see the note, and he was already asleep when Tite and I returned. He wrote on the note: "Let Mary eat my egg, I'm not hungry."

Tite and I looked at each other. Tite finally said, "I don't feel hungry either." "In any case, give it to Mary, - that's right!" He wrote this sentence after George's, but didn't finish it. So I wrote, "I'm not hungry either."

We were all asleep when Mary came back. The next morning, Mother's face looked very bad, and she was always holding the note. "I remember, I told you each to eat one."

We were all silent. Mother turned to Mary, who had just come in from outside. "I'm very surprised that you ate all the eggs! I'm really sad that you're so selfish!"

Mary lowered her head. Mother continued harshly, "Did you drop all the eggs? Did you? All the eggs in the cupboard are gone!"

Mary nodded.

Mother sighed. "But at least we have a hearty breakfast to eat. I told a food shop to send some food when I got home." She hurried to the kitchen.

After a while, Mother came back out, holding a very beautiful cake. "What is this?" she asked confusedly.

"This is a cake, Mother," Mary raised her head. "I made it last night after I got back, and I dropped four eggs. Because today is Mother's birthday."

Mother's tears fell, and she hugged Mary in her arms. "Child, God bless you!"

We happily ate the cake, although it was small and not baked properly, but we felt that it was the best cake we had ever eaten in our lives.

### Taicheng Road, Taipei, by Chen Jishuo

— Zhang Shizhao

I can speak of the city,
Coming again, the meaning is clearer.
Four corner watchtowers, surrounding tracks,
Like this for fifty years.
The deceased are mistaken, looking at the green leaves through winter,
The wilderness spreads the ground,
The old rivers and mountains, not my land,
How can they become different?
The sounds of teaching and home have ceased,
Alas, taking the capital for a long time,
The borderlands are difficult to govern.
The rivers and mountains on paper,
Wen Luo in dreams,
Who understands the deep meaning of the poet?
Miles away from home,
Facing the pomegranate of a full valley,
Red feelings are only beautiful.
Hate the cuckoo again,
The sound reaches the ear on a clear night.

### Responding to Mr. Xingyan's Poem, Respectfully Following Yuanjun's Rhyme

— Chen Jishuo

Singing while wandering has already exhausted me,
I still don't have a plan to return.
Spring is deep in the island country,
The city is full of green,
Secretly regretting that time flows like this.
The prisoner is old,
There are lingering sorrows of separation,
Wanting to bury them without a place,
Looking at the fairy mountains on the sea,
They all seem different in dreams.
Sadly, the clouds and trees are dim,
Asking about the black crow and horse horns,
Who inquires about Wu Ji?
The wild goose foot sinks the letter,
The knife ring breaks the dream,
The crying pigeon only stirs people's minds.
My home is thousands of miles away,
I guess the flowers blooming on the southern path,
Should also be like brocade.
At this moment, climbing the building,
Only letting tears fall in the wind.

### You? Wait a Moment!

### Talking About the "Do Not Engage" Sign

— Zhang Qiqu

Life is often unsatisfactory in eight or nine out of ten cases. I want to hear news of peace talks but can't, and I don't want to hear the sound of cannons, but the sound of cannons is getting louder and louder on the north bank. In great distress, I can't help but think of the rules of engagement in old novels.

In old novels, when both sides are at war, before the battle begins, Party A must first send a "challenge letter." If Party B does not intend to engage, they can hang up a "do not engage" sign, and Party A must not move its troops. I think, why don't we also learn from our ancient predecessors, make a "do not engage" sign, and hang it in the middle of the Yangtze River, in order to seek peace first and then talk? Wouldn't that be very good?

I remember at the beginning of the War of Resistance, a friend who was in charge of military supplies told me that a rifle bullet cost four jiao at the time. A direct-fire artillery shell cost 25 silver dollars. A cannon shell cost more than 120 yuan. By extrapolation, how much would a 500-pound bomb cost? How much would a 9,000-ton cruiser cost? In today's situation where the big heads are over 50,000 and the small heads are over 40,000, how much would the consumption of a bullet and a shell, converted into gold yuan notes, be? And the launch of even a small battle is certainly not something that can be accomplished with a single bullet or shell. So, in a situation where "the artillery fire is intense," imagine how many "four jiao" bullets, how many "25 yuan" and "120 yuan" shells are reduced to nothing in the sound of explosions? As someone who is deeply burdened by the economy, how can I not feel that it is a great pity?

Someone might say: although the consumption of bullets is large, if it leads to the success of the revolution, its cost is a hundred times greater than the loss of bullets. Weighing the pros and cons, this little consumption is nothing.

I say: not so. Although the artillery fire is fierce, in fact, not many people are hit. Machine guns rattle and cannons boom, but if every gun and every bullet could hit its target, the Chinese people would have been nearly wiped out by now since the War of Resistance. The pity is that most of these valuable bullets are wasted in barren fields, riverbanks, forests, and at the foot of mountains, to no avail. As for the small portion of bullets that hit their target, that's even worse. Think about it, those "human wave" components who are killed or injured, who doesn't have parents who have raised them to such a great extent as their treasured child. Now they are sacrificed in vain, wasting both bullets and lives, a double loss, gaining nothing. Isn't that even more regrettable?

Moreover, although peace talks are secret, they have in fact already begun. If they succeed, needless to say, there will always be a resolution in the future, and there is no need to sacrifice piecemeal at this time. In fact: whether it is the National Army or the Communist Army, they are all Chinese "people" with yellow skin and black hair; whether it is bullets or cannons, they are all the sweat and blood of the common people. When peace cannot be achieved, the common people have no power to stop the war; but now that both sides have started talking, can't we, the common people, persuade both sides to put down their knives and guns in the Yangtze River and first call a truce?

### Strange Wills

— Sang

A British furniture merchant wrote in his will: give each staff without a beard fifty-five pounds, but each staff with a beard, give only twenty-five pounds.

An American wealthy merchant who hated slender women, wrote in his will that each daughter could get a heritage proportionate to their weight.

A British lawyer, donated all of his heritage to charities, but left five shillings to his younger brother, because this was his last time supplying him with alcohol money.

A wealthy man who was addicted to alcohol when he was alive, donated his heritage to those singles who were willing to protect the bottle caps he had accumulated.

And another wealthy man's will, wrote: each relative who did not come to the will reading, can divide the heritage evenly.

### Cosmic Phenomena

— Cang Yi

In Huangshan Tangkou's hot spring, one spring eye's water is cold, another spring eye's water is hot, like a faucet of cold/hot water in a bathtub. There is a fragrant smell in the water, very similar to Qinan fragrance, because it is a cinnabar spring.

There is an American artist, who likes to make extremely tiny artworks. He recently completed a winter oil painting, the area is only one-sixty-fifth of a square inch, and it was drawn with a hair.

### The Captain's Housekeeping Notes

— Dongfang Jing

A captain's wife went to visit a warship, and saw that at around 10:00 AM, the ship had already been cleaned up, only two hours after breakfast. At a glance, she was shocked by the sailors' speed of doing things.

The captain told her: cooking, cleaning and laundry on a warship, like engineering and artillery, goes through precise studies, and methods and steps are designed by experts.

After some time, the captain was transferred to a department to work. After a few days, his wife injured her ankle and went to the hospital. So he took care of the household affairs himself, governing the housework according to the Navy's methods.

In order to scientifically plan the household affairs, the captain counted the time his neighbors spent on household affairs everyday. Among the eleven housewives, the average time spent on each household affair every week was as follows: cooking, eleven hours twelve minutes; cleaning, fourteen hours; ironing clothes, six hours; washing dishes, eight hours ten minutes; laundry (using machine), forty-five minutes; shopping, three hours.

This means that an average of more than six hours is spent every day. According to the Navy's standards, this is too much time. According to the Navy's methods, he must spend three hours every day on dealing with these household affairs.

So, he allocated the time like this:

6:00-8:00 AM every day: laundry, ironing, preparing breakfast, while preparing lunch and dinner. Cleaning the house, eating breakfast, changing clothes. Every morning, he cleaned a room particularly clean, and casually mopped the other rooms.

At 8:30 AM, he rushed to the Navy department to work. When he got home in the evening, he heated up the dinner that had been cooked in the morning (this emergency method is not used by general housewives), the bowls and plates were washed, and the kitchen was tidied up. He then spent half an hour making a "daily plan", determining what household affairs to do tomorrow, when to do them, and how to do them. This system is the soul of Navy efficiency. At 8:00 PM, everything was finished, and the captain began to rest.

Cleaning work can also become easier if done separately. For example, wipe one or two windows every day, wash the bathroom floor every Monday and Friday. If each family sets up a plan separately, the time of family operation can certainly be reduced.

Although, this matter happened in America, they have machines that can share the labor, but this method and spirit, can also be for our reference. Nowadays, when general housewives feel the annoyance of hiring employees, when it is necessary to operate all household affairs themselves, if they can take a shortcut, if they can set up a plan first, conduct two kinds of work at the same time, and use all kinds of labor, the husband and children both participate in a part of household operation, then it may be possible to make the household chores become more interesting work.
