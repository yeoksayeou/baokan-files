### Overall Situation May Improve Starting Next Year; Taiwan as a Base for Revival; Chen Cheng's Remarks to Provincial Leaders in Taiwan

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 30th] Chen Cheng convened a symposium with over two hundred leaders from party, government, military, people's organizations, and middle school principals at 9:00 AM on the 30th. Chen first reported on his impressions of his recent tour of Penghu and the southern counties, saying that Penghu, which is barren, is gradually being enriched. As for the southern counties, those in charge of administration still have a bureaucratic style, glossing over things, and making excuses about lacking funds to shirk responsibility for everything that needs to be done. He expressed his determination to improve administrative efficiency, simplify procedures, cultivate a spirit of law-abidingness, authorize local leaders, distinguish between priorities, and actively implement all matters that should be promoted and reformed. Chen went on to point out that communication and transportation were the things that dissatisfied him the most during this tour. He said: From now on, even the central government agencies stationed in the province will be punished if they fail to fulfill their duties. Chen then elaborated on the current situation and the position of Taiwan Province, saying that the Communist Party has destroyed peace, is controlled by the Third International, and is attempting to betray the country, which has been seen by the world. From now on, we should follow the instructions of the President's recent announcement, and the revolution will surely achieve final success. He said that the current situation is dire and may become more serious in the next few months, but he firmly believes that it will gradually improve starting next year, and the year after that will be the time for the Kuomintang to be reborn, and Nanjing can be retaken. He continued: There is absolutely no need to worry about Taiwan Province's economy. From now on, he will eliminate all speculators on the island and strictly prohibit the Fifth Column from mixing into the province, so that Taiwan Province can be used as a base for the revival of the Chinese nation. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep have been lost.

### Hong Kong Strengthens Defenses

Eden Calls for Defense of Hong Kong

[Reuters Hong Kong, 30th] It is learned that there are also many Hong Kong residents who are preparing to relocate, but according to travel agencies, there are not too many people who have inquired about transportation so far. Since the center of the Chinese civil war has shifted south, attention to defense issues has been stepped up here. A large number of people have volunteered or been transferred to join the Hong Kong Volunteer Defense Force this week to assist the police force and other civil defense forces. The Hong Kong regular defense force consists of approximately 6,500 people, including two battalions of Indian Gurkha infantry and an artillery brigade, all equipped with the latest equipment. The strength of the naval and air forces has also increased and can be further strengthened in a very short period of time. The strength of the police force has increased to more than 4,000 people in the past year.

[Agence France-Presse London, 29th] Former Foreign Secretary Eden said at a Conservative Party meeting here on the night of the 29th: "The tragic events in China clearly remind us that the Communist offensive is global. Strategically, the door to the Communist advance in Europe has been closed, and Asia is actually the back door to Europe. Such events in Asia will of course have a great impact on the interests of the Allies in the region. We will continue to defend Hong Kong, there should be no doubt about that, and the lessons of the Yangtze River incident should not be forgotten."

### Chinese Communists Prohibit Gold and Silver Transactions; Not Allowed as Pricing Standard for Trade

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 29th] The Chinese Communist radio station in Peiping broadcast a revised regulation on the control of gold and silver in the "Liberated Areas" of North China on the night of the 29th, stating that "the purpose of taking this measure is to stabilize the currency value and the people's standard of living." According to the new regulations, gold and silver are absolutely prohibited from being transported out of the "Liberated Areas." People can hold gold and silver or sell it to the "People's Bank," but it is not allowed to use gold and silver as a pricing standard for trade or to conduct gold and silver transactions. Those who transfer gold and silver into the country from other "Liberated Areas" or foreign countries must have a government permit. All people entering or leaving the "Liberated Areas" cannot carry more than one tael of gold jewelry as a deposit or more than four *shi* taels of any silver jewelry. Silverware as a personal gift does not require a permit. People who want to sell gold and silver can only sell it to the People's Bank. When gold and silver are needed for industrial, commercial, or other legal purposes, they should apply to the People's Bank. Those who violate this regulation will have their gold and silver confiscated or forced to sell it to the People's Bank at a discounted price of 85% to 70%.

### Bai Chongxi Flies to Guangzhou; There is Talk of Yan Xishan Taking a Key Position

[Central News Agency Guangzhou, 30th] Bai Chongxi arrived in Guangzhou from Wuhan on the evening of the 29th and visited President of the Executive Yuan He Yingqin. He also visited the leaders in Guangzhou such as Yu Hanmou and Xue Yue on the morning of the 30th. Bai told reporters that there was no major change in the situation in Hubei and Hunan. He also stated that he was determined to unite and obey the Central Government. Bai is scheduled to fly to Guilin on the 1st to visit Acting President Li.

[United Press Hong Kong, 30th] Newspapers in Guangzhou reported that powerful leaders of the Kuomintang are considering promoting General Yan Xishan to a very important position in the government. This is because Yan defended Taiyuan for nearly three years until it was recently lost. In contrast, other cities in North China, such as Peiping and Tianjin, quickly fell into the hands of the Communist army. Therefore, reusing Yan can make Guangdong more consolidated than Taiyuan.

[Central News Agency Guilin, 30th] Commander-in-Chief of the Army Zhang Fakui arrived in Guilin. Chairman Huang Xuchu hosted a banquet to welcome him and invited Director Li Pinxian and others to accompany him. It is learned that in addition to visiting Acting President Li, Zhang will also inspect the training of troops here and attend the establishment ceremony of the Guilin Pacification Headquarters. He will stay for three or four days before returning to Guangzhou.

[Another Cable] The Guilin Pacification Headquarters is scheduled to be established on May 1st. The vice directors will be Huang Xuchu and Mo Shujie, deputy commander of the Provincial Security Command. Zhang Guoquan has been announced as the chief of staff.

Elaborates on the Nature of Public Treasury Before Departure; Plans to Attend Sichuan Provincial Assembly to Report

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 30th] Legislator Liu Hangchen flew from Chongqing to Chengdu at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 30th.

Also, Liu stated that if the Sichuan Provincial Assembly invites him to attend to report, he will participate. (Also, in yesterday's cable that Chongqing and Chengdu would set up a joint public treasury, the word "正式" (zhèngshì, formal) in the text was a mistake for "證實" (zhèngshí, confirmed).)

[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 30th] The Fuzhou Municipal Government took decisive measures on the 30th against some rice merchants who were hoarding and speculating, ordering them to suspend business because their capital amount did not meet the regulations and they did not have rice to supply the market, which made the public very happy.

### British and American Governments Plan to Contact the Chinese Communists, But Not to Recognize the Chinese Communist Regime

[Reuters London, 29th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that Britain continues to maintain diplomatic relations with the Chinese government because that government is still the government recognized by Britain, but its current location is not very clear. If that government reassembles in Guangzhou, the British embassy office headed by Kirk Hay, Counselor of the British Embassy in Nanjing, will be found there. The British government will continue to try to establish contact with the Chinese Communist authorities, but such contact cannot be called diplomatic relations. When asked what kind of relationship Britain intends to establish with the Chinese Communist authorities, he replied, we hope it is a "friendly relationship." The spokesman also said that the Nanjing Embassy led by Ambassador Stephen cannot find anyone to establish contact with. There is currently no Chinese Communist authority with centralized power in Nanjing.

[United Press Washington, 29th] A State Department spokesman announced on the 29th that the United States intends to establish a relationship with the Chinese Communist Party in order to conduct business, but this does not mean recognizing or approving of the Chinese Communist regime. According to State Department sources, the United Kingdom and the United States recently exchanged views on whether their consulates should remain in Chinese Communist territory, and both sides agreed that they should stay. The United States now has consulates in Nanjing, Peiping, Shenyang, and other Chinese Communist territories, and an embassy in Nanjing.

### Kuomintang Central Executive Committee Issues a Declaration Opposing the Chinese Communist Party's Reddening of China and Disrupting World Peace

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 30th] The Central Reception Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang issued a declaration on the 30th, opposing the Chinese Communist Party's reddening of China and disrupting world peace. The full text of the declaration is as follows:

On New Year's Day this year, President Chiang, in order to eliminate war and disband troops, issued a message to the Chinese Communist Party proposing an end to hostilities and the holding of peace talks, and stated his position that as long as the national system is not changed, the constitutional government is not overthrown, and the people's free life and the national army are guaranteed, his personal advancement and retreat will be based solely on the public opinion of the people. Subsequently, on January 21st, he resolutely declared his advance retirement, in accordance with the Constitution, with Vice President Li acting as President to promote the progress of peace talks.

After Vice President Li assumed the presidential authority, he devoted himself to finding a way to peace talks with extreme forbearance and suffering. Premier Sun of the Executive Yuan originally advocated a peace of "glory and equality," but when his proposal could not be realized, he did not hesitate to resign resolutely, hoping that peace talks could be opened. Later, General He Yingqin was appointed to form a new cabinet to assist Vice President Li in continuing to work for peace. Finally, under the urging of public opinion, on April 1st, both parties' representatives began peace talks in Peiping. Our party, in accordance with popular sentiment, made sacrifices to achieve peace in good faith, as was seen by the world.

Our party formally announced five principles for peace talks and resolutions on April 18th, believing that they were the guiding principles for the current state of affairs. We originally hoped that the Chinese Communist Party would accept them, negotiate in good faith, and establish lasting peace to comfort the people's eager expectations. Unexpectedly, the Chinese Communist Party has always been obsessed with ending the war by force, abandoning the conspiracy to seize power through violence. After our government representatives arrived in Peiping, they proposed their so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement" in the form of an ultimatum. The eight articles and twenty-four clauses of its content were no different from cruelly and ruthlessly disposing of the Republic of China, which was built with great difficulty by the martyrs, fundamentally violating the spirit of the peace talks agreement. It has been formally rejected by Vice President Li and Premier He. At the same time, our party's Central Committee also issued a statement on the evening of April 20th, stating that our party would never accept such an agreement with nation-destroying conditions, and still hoped that the Chinese Communist Party would change its mind, both sides would order a ceasefire, and then engage in a long-term agreement. Our party's forbearance and sacrifice for the country and the people should also be understood by the world. However, after learning that our government had refused to sign this unreasonable agreement, the Chinese Communist Party blatantly disregarded everything and launched troops on April 21st to continue its invasion, forcibly crossing the Yangtze River in an attempt to sweep across the south of the Yangtze River and conquer the whole country. In order to redeploy its defense line and conduct a long-term resistance, the government had no choice but to withdraw from Nanjing and relocate the entire government to Guangzhou to continue fighting the Chinese Communist Party for the survival of the nation and to seek justice and achieve true and lasting peace.

What our party now wants to earnestly explain to people at home and abroad is that the birth and growth of the Chinese Communist Party is completely inseparable from its nature as the Fifth Column of the Red International. It is found that from the beginning of its establishment of party branches, it was subsidized by foreign money, and all its subsequent propaganda and actions were also subject to the orders of red international organizations. When our party reorganized in the 13th year of the Republic of China, in order to oppose imperialist aggression and carry out the National Revolution, it did adopt a policy of accommodating the Communists. Our party specially allowed Chinese Communist Party members to join our party as individuals. And it must abide by the joint statement of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and Mr. Joffe, the representative of the Third International, and must not carry out a communist revolution in China, and must take an oath to obey the Three Principles of the People on the day of joining the party. However, unexpectedly, after joining our party, the members of the Chinese Communist Party constantly secretly carried out their insidious conspiracy to promote the communist revolution. Before long, it was detected by our party. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, after the Northern Expeditionary Army arrived in Wuhan, the Chinese Communist Party betrayed the National Revolution and launched peasant riots in an attempt to overthrow the political power of the National Government. This was the first exposure of the Chinese Communist Party as the Red Fifth Column. Our party broke with the Chinese Communist Party from then on. The National Revolution led by our party was therefore greatly frustrated.

Thereafter, our party continued the Northern Expedition and completed the unification, originally hoping to end the destruction from then on and carry out the construction of the Three Principles of the People. Unexpectedly, the Chinese Communist Party turned to organizing Soviet governments in Hunan, Guangdong, Fujian, and Jiangxi in the manner of bandits, carrying out its cruel land revolution. At that time, countless innocent people sacrificed their lives in this kind of struggle policy, numbering in the millions. Later, when the National Army encircled and suppressed them, they desperately scurried to Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Sichuan, and only managed to preserve their last remnants in northern Shaanxi. At this point, the Chinese Communist Party had nowhere to go and launched another conspiracy, using the slogan of resisting Japan as a smokescreen to instigate the Xi'an Incident. Finally, thanks to the maintenance of Chairman Chiang by the people of the whole country, they were able to return to the capital and take charge of the government. Then the War of Resistance was not interrupted. In July of the 26th year, when our government launched the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese Communist Party once again issued a statement, acknowledging that the Three Principles of the People were what China needed today, striving for its thorough realization, abolishing its Soviet regime, abandoning the land revolution, reorganizing the Red Army into the Eighth Route Army, accepting the command of Chairman Chiang, and working hard for the War of Resistance.

Our party believed that the Chinese Communist Party could truly stimulate its patriotic conscience from then on, cooperate with our party again to resist the powerful enemy, which would be a great fortune for the country and the nation. However, in the three or four years after the War of Resistance, our party discovered that the Chinese Communist Party was using the War of Resistance as a cover to secretly expand its military strength and seize territory. Therefore, they were reluctant to engage the Japanese invaders and seized territory. They often attacked and contained the National Army. If it were not for the government's tolerance and consideration of the overall situation, the great cause of the War of Resistance would have been unthinkable. When the Japanese invaders surrendered, the Chinese Communist Party blatantly ignored the command of the Supreme Command and issued its own absurd order to accept the surrender, its ambition to betray the country again was obvious to everyone. At that time, in order to solve domestic problems by political means, so that the people could rest and engage in construction, the government convened the Political Consultative Conference. After a month of consultation, the results of the consensus of all parties were obtained. However, while friendly countries were carrying out mediation, the Chinese Communist Party still had the bad behavior of attacking the National Army everywhere and competing for territory. They also took advantage of the Soviet Red Army's occupation of the Northeast to delay the transfer of Lushun, Dalian, and the Northeast Railway, and dispatched cadres to sneak into Guanwai to recruit the puppet army and bandits, obtain the weapons of Japanese and Manchukuo prisoners, and develop their military strength in various parts of the Northeast. Zhang Xinfu, an engineer at the Fushun Coal Mine, was killed by the Communist Party at that time. The people of the country should still remember. The overall reddening of the Northeast today is the realization of the Chinese Communist Party's deliberate conspiracy. This is another complete exposure of the Chinese Communist Party as the Red Fifth Column. The results of the War of Resistance Against Japan led by our party have been destroyed again at this point. Based on our party's experience with the Chinese Communist Party over the past 20 years, we deeply know that the Chinese Communist Party is a group that has extinguished humanity, is insidious and vicious, and has no sincerity in its declarations and oaths, but only uses them as a means of fooling people and confusing society. Its doctrines change from yesterday to today, and its tactics are inconsistent. Its style is honey-mouthed and sword-hearted, sweet first and then bitter. The word "trust" does not exist in the Chinese Communist Party's dictionary. They have no compassion for human beings. In order to monopolize political power, they sacrifice the country and the nation, as well as countless precious lives, which they do not care about. Because they are obsessed with materialism and the historical view of struggle, they believe that human struggle is inevitable and that peace is illusory. Therefore, the party has never cooperated with any political party or individual outside the party on an equal footing, except for absolute control and domination. Even among its own members, there is no freedom of individual conscience and reason, except for absolute servitude to the party. A political party with such thoughts and beliefs is always a threat to human peace, world security, and individual life and freedom. When its power is not yet established, it may be possible to seek short-term temporary peace. Once its power becomes great, it will be difficult to have peaceful years. Its external form may change in countless ways, but its essence remains the same. The so-called New Democracy of Mao Zedong, and the Chinese Communist Party's propaganda to Westerners that it is only a peasant democratic party, are all temporary disguises to adapt to the environment. Therefore, since President Chiang's message on New Year's Day to reopen peace talks, for a period of four months, the Chinese Communist Party has never given up its ambition to seize political power by force, despite the urging of public opinion throughout the country. Even after the signing of the Atlantic Pact, Mao Zedong openly declared that when a world war occurs in the future, he will lead China to fight for the Soviet Union. His intention to be a henchman for a tiger and a tool for aggressive countries has been completely exposed. Who are the war criminals? How can they escape the eyes and ears of people at home and abroad?

Our party bears the responsibility of defending the Republic of China and world peace. Whenever we encounter any violence that endangers the country, the nation, and world peace and harms the people, we must lead the people of the whole country to eliminate it. Right and wrong are in people's hearts, and truth will never fail. This is our party's unwavering belief. Based on this belief, our party vows to abide by the Three Principles of the People, abide by the United Nations Charter, and strive to the end. People at home and abroad who love peace and cherish freedom should be able to recognize the significance of our party's continued war and provide spiritual and material support. Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.

### Weekly Forum Theory and Action

— Xie Youwei

What is theory? First, theory is a concept, an event in thought; second, theory can also be an event in written language. The progress of theory can be achieved from thought or concept to written or spoken language. But beyond the realm of written language, theory no longer becomes theory. Theory stops at the expression of written language. Written language is the limit of theoretical progress. Beyond this is the scope of action, not theory. Of course, if we are based on a doctrine of the unity of knowledge and action, this distinction does not exist. Because not only written language can be regarded as action, but thought can also be regarded as action in a certain sense. However, the distinction here is in the sense of common sense. In common sense, we cannot but admit that thought and written language are still within the scope of theory. Thus, a major characteristic of theory is peace. Theory is peaceful and without danger. The commonly called "dangerous theory" is definitely not the danger of the theory itself, nor the danger when the theory is still theory, but the danger when the theory becomes action. The danger lies in action, not in theory. As far as theory is concerned, theory is always peaceful. For example, someone proposes a theory to overthrow the government. If no one turns this theory into action, then the theory itself is not dangerous. Therefore, any presumptuous or false theory, on the condition that it does not become action, is not dangerous. Although theory may aim to modify the status quo or overthrow the status quo, it is not in itself a modification or overthrow of the status quo. The status quo is not affected by the theory itself. Theory is only the prelude to action, only the guide or plan for action. It only represents a possibility of action, but it is not the reality of action. It can become action, but it is not inevitable. Theory itself does not have the inevitability of becoming action. Without the inevitability of becoming action, all theories, no matter how false or presumptuous, are always peaceful, as long as they do not become action. We have nothing to fear from false theories. Theory itself will not harm people, let alone kill people. What harms people or kills people is action, actual action. Once it becomes action, all theories, even the most correct ones, are dangerous and not peaceful. This danger comes from action, and we must turn to discuss the so-called action.

What is action? First, action is a change in the physical appearance; second, action is also a change in the state of various environments outside the body. The development of action starts from the movement of the body itself, and then causes the action of the surrounding environment. As far as the origin of this movement is concerned, we have some control over it. Without discussing the issue of free will, we must always admit that all normal human beings have the power to control the activities of their hands and feet. When the state of coercion does not exist, normal human beings are able to freely move their hands and feet. However, after the movement of hands and feet, whether the environment moves, the degree of its movement, and the scope of its movement, are largely beyond the scope of human control. Human power can cause its own movement, but it cannot necessarily cause the movement of the environment. Even if it can cause the movement of the environment, this movement is not necessarily what the actor himself anticipated or needed. After the movement occurs, part of the consequences of the movement can be predicted, most of them cannot be predicted, part of them can be controlled, and most of them cannot be controlled. An atomic bomb was dropped over Hiroshima. What were the consequences of this action? The bomber or commander at the time may have foreseen the destruction of Hiroshima and the surrender of Japan, but could he have foreseen the current situation? Can he control the current situation? In any action, we cannot fully predict its consequences, nor can we fully control its consequences. Our predictions and our control have certain limits. Beyond certain limits, even natural scientists in laboratory experiments have unpredictable and uncontrollable components. The actions of atomic energy experimenters in the laboratory are a good example. Einstein is already regretting his invention! In this view, a major characteristic of action, which is exactly the opposite of theory, is insecurity. Action is insecure and extremely dangerous. The danger of action lies first in the excessive number of obstacles to action, and we cannot predict and control them all. Second, the impact of action is too broad, and it can extend to an infinite realm in both time and space, so we cannot predict and control it. Even if we consider ourselves to be extremely safe actions, sometimes they can have dangerous consequences. For example, I have one tael of gold. After I exchange it for gold yuan bills, I will use it to purchase materials. From my personal point of view, I really cannot see any danger in this action. However, if I do this, and the second person, the third person, and even the people of the whole of Shanghai and the whole of China do this, and they all turn the gold yuan bills exchanged for gold or foreign currency into materials, the danger will immediately occur. The recent economic crisis can be said to have been partly caused by such actions. Was this something I could have foreseen? Could I have controlled its impact? This fully demonstrates the danger of any action.

The above briefly explains a major characteristic of theory and action. Because theory is peaceful, we can be more casual, more laissez-faire, or more free with theory. At the stage of theory, all theories can be proposed, published, and circulated arbitrarily. Even if we think it is the most absurd or false theory, we may as well consider it. The more theories we consider, the more likely a correct theory is to be formed. Action is different. Because action is dangerous, we must be very cautious about action and cannot be too laissez-faire or too free. In particular, the government's actions on political and economic matters should be treated with great caution. Its danger is more dangerous than any action. Its mistakes are related to the lives and property of the people of the whole country. It does not allow for mistakes. As the ancients said, "One slip makes a thousand years of regret." The mistakes of action cannot necessarily be remedied by another action. Therefore, before the government takes any political and economic action, it must have a long period of consideration, a very thorough consideration, and it must first solicit various theories for reference for action. When doing so, even if the danger of action cannot be completely avoided, it can at least reduce the danger of action. When doing so, even if the government's actions still have mistakes, it is more likely to gain the understanding of the people of the whole country. This is a step that all actions should take, especially the steps that government actions should take. Without doing so, without going through such steps, this action is rash and excessively ignores the danger of action. Based on this, what we can criticize about the economic actions taken by the government this time is that the action was rash and excessively ignored the danger of action. The reason is that the government's action this time did not go through the review of the Legislative Yuan and did not widely adopt the theories of various parties, but issued it with an emergency decree. This is what we can criticize the government for.

However, although we can criticize the government for its rash actions or criticize its theoretical errors, we must pay attention to two very important points. The first point is the unavoidable danger of the action itself. This means that the government's action may be correct, but it has encountered unavoidable obstacles or dangers. This is the only thing we can forgive the government for. The second point is that our criticism of the government is not necessarily correct. Our criticisms and our suggestions are all theories before they become actions. Our theories, before being tested by action, also have the possibility of error. Now the government has actually adopted some of the critics' theories and put them into action. Can this modified or corrective action succeed or is there no danger at all? This will naturally have to be proven by future facts. What can be said here is that difficulties or dangers are difficult to completely avoid. We will immediately rise up again to criticize the government's actions. This can be asserted. Theorists always stand in a safe position, and actors always stand in a dangerous position. This is the main difference between theory and action. Although this does not absolve the government of responsibility for its actions, it can enable us to have a clearer or more just understanding of this economic change.

### Soviet Union Proposes Conditions for Lifting Berlin Blockade Initial Progress in US-Soviet Talks Foreign Ministers' Meeting Likely to Be Held at the End of May

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 30th] A spokesman for the US Mission to the United Nations announced last night after US Representative Jessup and British Representative Malik consulted that the two representatives' consultations had made extremely satisfactory progress. The spokesman also said that the representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union decided to report the consultations between Jessup and Malik to their respective governments. The spokesman did not reveal what the issues of the consultations were. Jessup left here on the 29th for Washington to submit a detailed report to Secretary of State Acheson. The spokesman stressed that the consultations were preliminary in nature in order for both sides to learn the correct content of the proposal and decide whether the proposal could be accepted.

[Associated Press, New York, 30th] The Soviet Union and Western countries made very slow progress today on the establishment of an agreement to lift the Berlin blockade. Representatives of Western countries believe that it is not possible to be too optimistic at this time, but they believe that the Soviet proposal is reasonable.

[Associated Press, New York, 29th] US Representative Jessup, at the invitation of Soviet Representative Malik today, held a fifth conversation at the Soviet delegation's office to discuss the liberation of the Berlin blockade, which lasted two and a half hours. The results have not yet been announced, but Jessup was seen smiling when he left. Jessup now intends to report to the State Department and then meet with the British and French representatives. Jessup said that it has not yet been determined whether to hold another conversation with the Soviet representative. According to informed sources, Malik has submitted a reply to the US inquiry as to when and under what conditions the Soviet Union is willing to lift the Berlin blockade. Malik also suggested that a meeting of the four foreign ministers should be held in Paris around May 25 to discuss the entire Berlin issue. In addition, it is learned that Malik suddenly proposed at the UN General Committee this morning that the current session of the General Assembly should end on May 18 so that representatives of major groups can have more than a week of leisure to attend the meeting on the 25th in Paris. The only obstacle to the meeting of the four foreign ministers is now how to draw up the agenda.

### British and American Policies Towards Germany Hope Germany Completes Unification Bevin Receives Report on US-Soviet Talks

[Associated Press, New York, 29th] The "New York Times" today carried reliable news from Lake Success that if the meeting of the four foreign ministers is restored, the United Kingdom and the United States will suggest that the Soviet occupation zone in Germany be merged with West Germany to become a unified country. The effect of this proposal is to make the Soviet strategy unable to use its skills. However, France has not yet expressed its agreement. The United States also intends to suggest a major reduction in military forces, but does not agree with the Soviet Union's proposal to withdraw all occupying forces. Spokesmen for the British and American delegations at Lake Success said that they knew nothing about the above news in the "New York Times" and that if there was such a proposal, it would have to be drafted in Washington or London.

[Reuters, London, 29th] Judging from reports from New York, London has great hope that the Berlin blockade can be lifted quickly, followed by a meeting of foreign ministers to discuss the German problem. Foreign Minister Bevin has received a report from British Chief Representative to the UN McNeil regarding his discussions with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko on the Berlin issue on Wednesday. Bevin has also received a report from British Representative to the Security Council Cadogan on the discussions between US and Soviet representatives Jessup and Malik on the Berlin issue. These reports show that the Soviet Union has adopted a tactful attitude on the issue of lifting the Berlin blockade. According to relevant sources, the exact date for the liberation of the blockade and the convening of the foreign ministers' meeting has not yet been determined, but the date for the convening of the foreign ministers' meeting will not be later than May. However, according to another authoritative source, it is not impossible for the efforts to liberate the Berlin blockade to be thwarted again. The United Kingdom is paying particular attention to whether the Soviet Union has any attempt to hinder the establishment of the West German government.

### West German Plan Determined to Proceed as Scheduled

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 29th] The British and American military governors have informed the premiers of the British and American zones of West Germany that, regardless of whether there is a new four-power meeting, West Germany will still be established as scheduled.

### Moscow Cautious About Berlin Problem Negotiations Soviet Newspapers Do Not Mention a Word

[Associated Press, Moscow, 29th] The Soviet Union's attitude towards lifting the Berlin blockade and restoring the meeting of the four foreign ministers is very cautious today. The Moscow newspapers have not mentioned a word about this news for two days. US President Truman's remarks that the Soviet Union has sincerity are very welcome here. Opening the Berlin deadlock is enough to improve the relationship between the Soviet Union and Western countries. There is indeed hope and considerable belief here. According to an ambassador of a neutral country, "I still believe in the skills of politicians, and I still believe that international harmony can be promoted by the skills of politicians. Both sides have politicians, and in the current situation, nothing is impossible. This may be a turning point for the world's expectations."

[Associated Press, London, 30th] The Moscow radio station broadcast the "Truth Daily" editorial on Labor Day today, accusing the British and American warmongers of having drafted a crazy plan to dominate the world, but it will never succeed. The friendship between the Soviet Union and the British and American people is the best guarantee of lasting peace. At the same time, according to Moscow, Soviet people are very reserved about the possibility of lifting the Berlin blockade.

### Soviet Union Emphasizes British Commonwealth Conference; Believes Pacific Pact is Brewing

[Reuters, Moscow, 29th] The Soviet Union's Red Star newspaper stated today that the London Conference of Dominion Prime Ministers is an important step in establishing a Pacific Pact under British leadership. The aim is to include Pacific or Indian Ocean countries within the system of the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands, and Japan may also participate in this system. People in the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions are now more actively participating in the peace movement and believe that the Atlantic Treaty and other systems attached to it will inevitably fail.

[United Press, London, 29th] Pakistani Prime Minister Ali Khan stated that the outcome of the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference will not affect Pakistan's position within the Commonwealth. However, Pakistan insists on reserving the right to withdraw from the Commonwealth at any time.

### Clay to Resign; Farewell Address to the German People

[Agence France-Presse, Frankfurt, 29th] General Clay, the US Commander of the Occupying Forces in Germany, delivered a farewell address today to the Chairman of the Council of Ministers in the Anglo-American zone, stating that even if the Soviet Union lifts the Berlin blockade, the airlift will continue. Clay also said that the Allies will never allow the dangerous situation in Berlin to recur in the future. All existing institutions in West Germany will continue to exist until a federal government is established to replace them. Clay said that the German people work very hard and are very talented in technical research, and he also praised the German people's good discipline. Kaiser, the President of the Bremen Senate, spoke on behalf of his colleagues in the Anglo-American zone, expressing his gratitude for Clay's achievements in Germany. Clay is expected to resign soon.

### Handling Former Italian Colonies; UK and US Propose New Proposals; Soviet Union Advocates Early Conclusion of the UN General Assembly

[Reuters, London, 30th] According to well-informed sources, the United Kingdom and the United States will submit a resolution to the UN Political Committee authorizing the UN General Assembly to grant Libya independence in ten years. Within these ten years, the United Kingdom will be the trustee of Cyrenaica, and a committee organized by the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, and Egypt will determine the trustees of other parts of Libya besides Cyrenaica and then submit a report to the UN General Assembly in September this year.

The entire plan proposed by the United Kingdom and the United States regarding the Italian colonies also suggests that Italy be the trustee of Italian Somaliland, the western part of Eritrea be assigned to Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, and the remaining part be assigned to Abyssinia.

[Agence France-Presse, Flushing, 29th] Representative Malik protested the slow progress of the Political Committee's debate on the work of the former Italian colonies, saying that the delay in the discussion was deliberately caused by various countries unwilling to resolve the issue, and they also hoped to abandon the debate on the Spanish and Indonesian issues. Malik suggested that the UN General Assembly should close on May 18.

### Proposal to Establish International Security Force Referred to a Special Committee

[Agence France-Presse, Flushing, 29th] The United Nations General Assembly decided today to organize a special committee of fourteen member states, including China, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, to study Secretary-General Trygve Lie's proposal to establish an 800-member United Nations Security Force. The security force is intended to protect and technically assist various committees of the United Nations. The organization of the aforementioned special committee was approved by a vote of 47 to 6, with one abstention. The Soviet Union, Poland, and Yugoslavia opposed the proposal, believing that the United Nations Charter stipulates that any international security force should be placed under the management of the Security Council, so the proposal is in conflict with the Charter.

### Guo Moruo and His Entourage Return Home via Moscow

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 30th] The Chinese delegation participating in the World Peace Congress arrived here on the night of the 29th. The delegation, led by Guo Moruo, is taking this route to return home.

### Harriman Urges Ratification of the Atlantic Treaty

Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee

[Reuters, Washington, 29th] Averell Harriman, the US roving ambassador for the Marshall Plan in Europe, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today on the Atlantic Treaty, stating that after the establishment of the Atlantic Treaty, free people will unite to safeguard freedom, so the faith of the people of Western Europe has increased more than before. If the United States turns a blind eye at this time, it is unknown whether this spirit can be restored. The trend of anti-violence among the people of Europe is now surging again. If not for this, the Communists may have already won in Italy, and the French Communists may have controlled the government.

[Reuters, Ottawa, 30th] The Canadian Senate unanimously passed a resolution yesterday to ratify the North Atlantic Treaty. The Canadian House of Commons will begin debating the treaty this week.

### Mrs. Quezon's Death Was Caused by Bandits

### Indo-Dutch Negotiations Achieve Progress; Agreement in Principle that Indonesia Returns to Yogyakarta

[Reuters, Batavia, 30th] It is reported that the informal talks between Dutch and Indonesian representatives under the auspices of the United Nations Commission have agreed in principle that the Republican government should return to Yogyakarta. The United Nations Commission has now begun to address other points of contention, such as the extent to which the Republican government exercises full powers, and the Dutch requirements for the Republic to comply with the ceasefire order and the date of the round table conference to be held in The Hague. The Republic demands the restoration of the exercise of full sovereignty, but the Dutch believe that the sovereignty exercised by the Republic can only be the same as that of the current Indonesian federal state. The United Nations Commission is currently trying to mediate.

[Reuters, London, 29th] The ambassadors of the ten founding countries of the Council of Europe held talks today at the British Foreign Office to prepare for the convening of the meeting of the foreign ministers of the ten countries on May 30.

### Churchill Issues Campaign War Signal

Revealing the Conservative Party's Four-Point Plan

[Reuters, London, 29th] British Conservative Party leader Winston Churchill issued a campaign war signal to his six thousand followers at the Cherry Blossom Alliance's conference at Albert Hall in London today. He said, "We have now entered a decisive year, which will produce the most noteworthy election battle. The Conservative Party's future is very promising, but every Conservative Party member still needs to exert their greatest effort." Churchill pointed out that the people are uneasy about the Labour Party's nationalization plan, so the Labour Party feels that it has no chance of winning. The recent suggestion by Labour Deputy Prime Minister Morrison that voters who elect workers from parties other than the Labour Party will have a signal shows that the Labour Party leaders have no confidence. This indicates that the Labour Party is gradually approaching failure and that the Labour Party disregards the foundations of political freedom. The Conservative Party Deputy Leader put forward the Conservative Party's four-point plan: (1) Reduce government spending to reduce taxes; (2) Stop the nationalization plan; (3) Launch a production stimulation plan; (4) Restore the Victorian era's spirit of thrift, which is the foundation of British national wealth.

(3) The governments of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States hope and expect that the occupying authorities will not need to take other actions except for the items specifically reserved above. However, the occupying authorities still reserve the right to restore all of its rights, in whole or in part, in accordance with the instructions of its own government, when it deems it necessary to ensure the security of Germany, or to maintain a democratic government, or to fulfill international obligations. However, before implementing this, the German legal authorities should be formally notified of this decision and its reasons.

State laws and their amendments, as well as all other laws, and any agreements concluded between the Federal Government and foreign governments, may take effect 21 days after formal notification, unless the occupying authorities reject them in advance or finally. The occupying authorities will not reject any legislation unless the occupying authorities believe it is inconsistent with the Basic Law, state law, and the occupying authorities' legislation or other directives, or the provisions of these regulations, or seriously threatens the basic objectives of the occupation.

(6) The occupying authorities guarantee that, except for what is necessary for their own security, the occupying agencies will respect the civil rights of individuals, and will not arbitrarily arrest, search, or detain, and will be allowed to hire lawyers, post bail as circumstances permit, communicate with relatives, and receive fair and prompt trials.

(7) Laws enacted by the occupying authorities before the Basic Law takes effect will continue to be effective unless canceled or amended in accordance with the following provisions: (A) Laws that conflict with the above provisions should be repealed or amended to comply. (B) Laws based on the reserved powers in (A) and (B) above may be repealed by the occupying authorities at the request of the German legal authorities.

(8) Any action taken by the occupying authorities in the form of an agreement shall be deemed to have the effect of an action within the reserved powers in accordance with these regulations. The occupying authorities may act expediently, or directly implement their decisions, or have the German legal authorities implement them.

(9) Twelve months after these regulations take effect, or in any case within eighteen months, the occupying countries should review their provisions with the experience of using these regulations, in order to promote the authority of the German authorities in legislation, administration, and justice.

### Salary Index Announced for the First Time; 371,344 Times the Base; Authorities Decide on Two Measures for Wage Payment

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Employee Living Index Compilation and Review Committee held a routine meeting at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 10:00 AM yesterday. Those present included Municipal Government Statistics Director Chu Yifei, Social Affairs Bureau Director Cao Peizi, Labor Affairs Department Director Shen Ding, Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yan E'sheng, General Labor Union Fang Rusheng, Ye Xianggao, Sun Wenyuan, Qiu Changjiang, Industrial Association Tian Heqing, Liu Qingyi, Ouyang Lun, Jin Runxiang, etc. Chairman Chu Yifei first reported on the current employee living cost index. Based on the suggestion of the labor-management evaluation committee and approved by the municipal government meeting, the average of the three highest material prices of the current period was adopted as the salary index. It was then decided to fix three types of indexes: base period index, chain index, and salary index, as follows:

(1) The fixed base index takes 48.04 times the upper half of January of the 38th year (1949) as the base period. The total index and classification indexes are as follows:

Total index: 4909.37 (235,846 times the base price of August 19)

Classification indexes:

Food Category: 5266.61

Clothing Category: 4211.70

Water, Electricity, Fuel, and Housing Category: 5091.58

Miscellaneous Category: 3034.50

(2) Chain index (i.e., the comparison of the current period to the previous period)

Total index: 15.58

Classification indexes:

Food Category: 15.04

Clothing Category: 16.94

Water, Electricity, Fuel, and Housing Category: 18.01

Miscellaneous Category: 12.40

(3) Salary index (i.e., based on the average price of the three days with the highest prices in the current period). The total index and classification indexes are as follows:

Total index: 7729.90 (371,344 times the base price of August 19)

Classification indexes:

Food Category: 8254.54

Clothing Category: 7040.83

Water, Electricity, Fuel, and Housing Category: 7978.22

Miscellaneous Category: 4746.30

The above figures were carefully reviewed by the committee members and signed after passing.

In addition, the municipal authorities, in view of the extreme confusion of various prices in recent days, had a temporary emergency measure of temporarily not publishing the current employee living cost index. However, due to the different basic salaries of various manufacturers and employees, the settlement was quite difficult. After careful discussion by the municipal government in conjunction with relevant agencies, it was decided that the lower-term employee living cost index for April would still be published as usual according to the results of the index compilation and review meeting held at 10:00 AM yesterday.

The National Bank Should Exchange and Issue 400,000 Silver Dollars

In addition, two measures for wage payment were decided as follows: (1) In order to stabilize prices and stabilize the lives of workers, the National Bank should allocate 1.6 trillion yuan in cash to various factories for wages. It should be exchanged for silver dollars, with each silver dollar priced at 4 million yuan in gold yuan coupons, and 100,000 silver dollars should be allocated daily. The exchange procedure is that the factory's corresponding bank drafts a check from the National Bank, which is endorsed by the factory and the Industrial Association and must be completed from April 30th to May 4th (one day is Sunday). (2) Each factory union's wages can be exchanged for one silver dollar in advance according to the standard of each silver dollar price in the first article. The remaining wages shall be supplemented by the factory with physical goods or banknotes within four days after April 30.

Condolences to the Soldiers

To Commander-in-Chief Tang of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters and to all the soldiers on the front line in this city: The Communist bandits disregard faith, are vicious by nature, destroy peace, openly fund the country, and have recently forcibly crossed the Yangtze River, approaching Shanghai.

Remembering your hard work and feeling grateful for your many meritorious services in defense, in addition to actively mobilizing 6 million citizens as a powerful rear support, we send this telegram to express our condolences and wish you good health and success in suppressing the bandits.

### Post Office Organizes Bicycle Delivery Team to Transport Mail to Liuhe and Other Places

### Industrial Association Manufacturers and Employees Are All Paid in Silver Dollars; Each Silver Dollar is Priced at 4 Million Yuan; Cash is Paid to Other Sectors

[Reported by this newspaper] According to a person in charge of the Central Bank, the reporter was told yesterday that various industrial and commercial sectors have begun to pay salaries one after another since yesterday. Except for the payment of salaries to the member manufacturers affiliated with the Industrial Association, in accordance with the resolution of the bank’s loan and allocation review committee, all salaries are paid in silver dollars. Cash will be paid to other sectors, so the situation of cash payment yesterday was fairly smooth. The silver dollars issued by the bank to the Industrial Association since yesterday will be cleared within four days. All the silver dollars issued are ship dollars (圓), and the price is 4 million yuan per piece. The total amount of salary paid by the Industrial Association is 1.6 trillion yuan, and it is decided to distribute it within four days. The allocated amount for the four days is as follows: 300 billion yuan on the 30th, 400 billion yuan on the 2nd, 500 billion yuan on the 3rd, and 400 billion yuan on the 4th. A total of 400,000 ship dollars must be issued.

In addition, after the bank changed the salary payment for the Industrial Association to ship dollars yesterday, the original method of exchanging gold for silver dollars will no longer be considered for restoration. The bank will be able to find a way to supply as much cash as possible to other parties who need it for paying salaries, since the cash originally needed for the Industrial Association to pay salaries has now been changed to silver dollars. In addition, the bank still issued cash for half of the funds due to the silver industry yesterday.

### Mayor's Cup Men's and Women's Finals: Green Team vs. Eagle Team, China United vs. Hui Li; Additional Friendly Match Between Da Gong and Shanghai Police

In the Mayor's Cup basketball tournament, in addition to one game each of the men's and women's round-robin finals tonight, the organizers have added a friendly match between Da Gong and Shanghai Police between the two finals, for a total of three games. The games will start at 4:30 PM (daylight saving time). Tickets are 200,000 for the upper level, 400,000 for the lower level, and 800,000 for reserved seating inside the court. Reserved seating tickets will be pre-sold at the Municipal Gymnasium from 10:00 AM, and the remaining tickets will be sold from 1:00 PM. The stadium gates will open at 3:00 PM, and the Scout Association of China will maintain order in the stadium. The program for today is recorded as follows:

Green Team vs. Eagle Team (Women's Final) 4:30 PM

Da Gong vs. Shanghai Police (Friendly) 5:15 PM

China United vs. Hui Li (Men's Final) 6:15 PM

In the first game, the women's final between Green Team and Eagle Team, the former is the women's basketball champion and has recently won the league championship for the fourth consecutive time. Their strength and momentum are immense, and they intend to win the Mayor's Cup. They will not relax at all in tonight's game. Although the Eagle Team is a new team, under the leadership of Wang Shan, their basketball skills are quite impressive. Their player Yang Shujun is unusually brave. Facing a formidable opponent, they will do their best, and a wonderful performance is expected.

The second game is the match between Da Gong and Shanghai Police. Both teams are strong basketball teams in Shanghai. Da Gong did not participate in this year's league and was unfortunately defeated by Hui Li in the Mayor's Cup knockout stage, so they did not have the opportunity to compete with Shanghai Police. Holding a friendly match will satisfy the curiosity of the fans, and a wonderful performance is expected.

The final game is the men's final between China United and Hui Li. The former is the old men's basketball champion, with extraordinary style. In the first game of the finals, although they encountered stubborn resistance from Ren Yu and were seriously threatened, they were able to remain calm and reverse the situation in the final moments, ultimately achieving victory. Hui Li's basketball skills are improving steadily. Overwhelming Da Gong and advancing to the final four is commendable. In addition to the three musketeers of Tian, Wang, and Zhao, Shang's brothers and Yu Dinghou are all as lively as dragons and tigers. Although they lost to Shanghai Police in the finals, they will fight bravely against the formidable opponent, and success is not impossible.

Eight Games in the Division B Table Tennis League Today

Due to work commitments, the Shanghai Police team in Division B2 of the table tennis league is unable to continue the competition and has sent a letter to the authorities stating their withdrawal. The points for all the games that the team has played will not be counted. The game against Xinghuo tonight has also been cancelled. Today, starting at 9:00 AM, there will be a total of eight Division B games, held in the Jingfen and Postal ballrooms. The game between B2 Fan Sheng and Chong Ben is expected to be exciting. B1 Hongbai can beat Shuping, but will definitely lose to Lingyun. B1 Xingguang, the champion of last year's Division C, has strong strength, and Guansheng Jingwei will hardly be able to resist and may be defeated. Tiema has excellent spirit in four games, but is still no match for Tianxiang. Yi Zhong has many small ball players, but may be frustrated by Yucai at the table tennis table. Jinmen 3 will face a strong team and learn from You 3.

### Division A Football League: 5-0, Longtou Beats Qunli

In the second round of the Division A football league, Qunli played against Longtou again at Yiyuan Stadium at 3:30 PM yesterday. The audience was not crowded. The referee was He Chunhui, and the linesmen were Li Guoyi and Zhang Zhijiang. In the match between the two teams, Qunli's players were incomplete, with only ten players. After the start of the game, Qunli attacked first but was blocked. Soon, Longtou rushed straight from the left, and Jin Gen passed the ball in front of the enemy. Jiang Kun passed to Xiao Jiang, and Xiao Jiang passed again to Xu Humin to shoot, but Xi Boming saved the goal. At the eighth minute, Qunli attacked again, and Zhao Zhenhui shot powerfully from 30 yards away from the goal. Min Chengkuan calmly caught it. After that, the battle became sticky. At the 20th minute, Qunli's Lin Shaojun got the ball and passed it back to Xi Boming. A mistake allowed Jiang Kun to take the opportunity to score into the empty goal, opening the scoring. Then the two teams had a fiery performance. Zheng Bingyi played rough, and Zhou Bingrong was also warned. At the 34th minute, Xu Humin scored, giving Longtou a 2-0 lead. At the 42nd minute, Jiang Kun and Ruan Lang scored again, ending the first half with a score of 3-0.

Changing sides to fight again, the battle was still tense, and the actions of both sides did not improve. Qunli's Zhao Zhenhui was warned again. After ten minutes, Xia Shufu attacked and assisted Wang Burong. Wang Burong shot, but Xi Boming pushed it out not far away. Jiang Kun waited and kicked the ball into the net, making it 4-0. At the 27th minute, Longtou had another chance. The forward advanced, and Chen Qin crossed from the right. Jiang Kun dribbled the ball quickly and scored, making it 5-0. Qunli surrendered. After another ten minutes, Longtou's defender fouled and was awarded a penalty. Qunli's Chen Longquan took the penalty, but the ball bounced back from Yan Chengkuan's body, missing a good opportunity. Although they tried to recover, they were unable to do so due to their depleted strength. As a result, Qunli lost by five goals, losing to Longtou again.

### Frequent Good News Excites People; Gold Rises All the Way; Silver Dollars Are in Short Supply and Demanded

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday's gold market was even more frenzied, with frequent good news exciting the people. With money still loose and no other outlet for funds, everyone scrambled to buy, and under the influence of the buying spree, raw silk opened at 190 million and 210 million in the over-the-counter market, rising all the way to 350 million and 370 million, breaking through the 300 million mark.

In the over-the-counter market for US dollars, various gangs were buying and selling dollars, and arbitrage was lively. The opening price was 4 million and 4.5 million, rising all the way to 7.5 million, about twice as high as the previous day. On the streets, "big heads" (silver dollars) were exchanged for US dollars, trading at 7 to 7.5 yuan.

[Another dispatch] Yesterday's street silver dollars, due to the Central Bank's large banknotes flowing out, increased the number of cash chips. Those holding Chinese currency only bought and did not sell, resulting in a shortage of supply. The "big heads" broke through the four million mark from 2.6 million and 2.8 million, and rose to 4 million and 4.5 million near noon.

After the banking hours, the rising momentum slowed down, because a large amount flowed in from Ningbo. In the evening, amidst a chorus of sell orders, it could reach 3 million and 3.5 million. "Small heads" were 2.8 million and 3 million. Draft transactions were divided into three types: Central Bank fixed-amount drafts, with "big heads" finally trading at 5 million and 6 million; bank drafts before number 50 traded at 8 million and 9 million; and large-amount drafts from small banks traded at 9 million and 10 million, an increase of 50% from the previous day.

Another dispatch: At the Dengjiao Building, the gold and silver exchange ratio saw frequent inflows and outflows, and trading was brisk. "Big heads" initially traded at 33 and 36, rising to 36 and 39, and finally falling to 35 and 38.

### Gold Bonds Hit Upper Limit

Due to the rapid rise in gold, people are extremely excited, and there are prices but no goods in the market, so there is no transaction. The opening price was shouted at 10,944,000 yuan, hitting the upper limit. There were no sales until noon, and there was no market after banking hours on Saturday.

### Rice Prices Nearly Double

Still About the Same as the Previous Day When Converted to Silver Dollars

The trading time for rice has been very short recently. Trading opens at 9:30 AM and ends at 10:30 AM. Yesterday, rice prices rose sharply again due to the rise in gold, banknotes, and silver dollars. The Nanshi Market had white japonica rice at 15 million yuan, thin indica rice at 15.6 million yuan, and early rice at 14.1 million yuan, all rising nearly twofold. However, when converted to silver dollars, they were still about the same as the previous day, with white japonica rice at 5 yuan, thin indica rice at 5.2 yuan, and white japonica rice and thin indica rice at 12.1 million yuan in the Beishi Market, all being cash prices. The registered arrival of goods in the two markets was 347 shi.

Cooking oil followed the rapid rise in gold, banknotes, and silver dollars by more than twofold, but the rise was not as fast as that of silver dollars, so the price converted to silver dollars actually decreased. Soybean oil closed at 11.9 million to 11.2 million, raw vegetable oil at 98 million, and lucky barrel raw oil at 11.2 million, all being draft prices, rising more than twofold. When converted to silver dollars, soybean oil was 16 yuan, raw vegetable oil was 13 yuan, and raw oil was 16 yuan, each decreasing by 2 yuan.

Bingship opened in the morning at 3.4 million, and closed at 3.6 million, equivalent to 1.03 silver dollars. Bran remained firm, with a large package of Fuxin at 3.5 million, equivalent to 1 silver dollar.

The rise in miscellaneous grains was in full swing, and the gold yuan was devaluing more and more. The market quoted prices were shockingly chaotic. Soybeans increased sharply by more than double, and more beans were priced at 10 million. Raw kernels increased violently by one time. Sesame trading was still strong, and corn was clearly firm but secretly weak. When converted to gold yuan, the rise was still strong. Vegetables were quoted at 3.8 yuan, and red sorghum and meta wheat were still not trading.
