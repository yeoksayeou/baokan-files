### The Success or Failure of Peace Talks Hangs by a Thread. A Tense and Heavy Atmosphere in Nanjing. The Government Closely Studies the CCP's Demands

[Our Dispatch] According to the CCP's radio station in Beiping on the 17th, today is the 17th day of the peace talks. From April 1st to 12th, the CCP delegation and the Nanjing delegation, after frequent contact and exchange of opinions, drafted a domestic peace agreement. On the 13th, the two delegations held a formal meeting in the Forbidden City. The CCP delegation explained the CCP's position and the reasons for the draft agreement. The Nanjing delegation expressed its own position and opinions on the draft agreement. On the 15th, the two sides held a second formal meeting. The CCP delegation delivered the final revised version of the agreement to the Nanjing delegation. The full text of the agreement consists of eight articles and twenty-four clauses, which not only adopted the opinions of the Nanjing delegation, but also actively provided opinions from the leading figures of various democratic parties. At the meeting between the two sides on the 15th, the CCP delegation announced that the deadline for the negotiations was April 20th. Whether the Nanjing delegation is willing to sign the agreement must be indicated before April 20th. April 20th is the signing date. At 11:00 a.m. on the 16th, the Nanjing delegation sent representative Huang Shaohong and advisor Qu Wu to fly to Nanjing to ask the Nanjing government for instructions. The reply from Nanjing is now being awaited.

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] It has been confirmed that the two demands made by the CCP, namely the establishment of a joint organization in politics and the immediate crossing of the Yangtze River in military affairs, are the most important parts of the eight articles and twenty-four clauses proposed by the CCP. When discussing all the clauses, some issues can be negotiated and compromises can be made on both sides, but the above two points have become the focus of difficulty, especially the short time limit, which adds to the difficulty. It is said that the joint organization referred to is named the Control Committee, which is composed of representatives from both sides and has the full power to replace the current government. As for the request to cross the Yangtze River, it is hoped that it will be realized as soon as possible to implement the reorganization of the army and "ensure peace talks." The first article of the eight conditions was originally to punish war criminals. After consultation, the original proposal has been abandoned and is no longer insisted, but it is explained who is responsible for the war crimes, that President Chiang must go abroad, and that certain people listed as war criminals must not participate in the future joint government.

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] Acting President Li will not accept the two demands proposed by the CCP in the eight articles and twenty-four clauses, namely the organization of a joint organization and the crossing of the Yangtze River by the Communist army. This reporter obtained this hint when interviewing someone close to Acting President Li on the 17th. The person admitted that the biggest difficulty at present is the above two points. After emphasizing that "the government will never surrender," he declared: "The Communist army must not cross the Yangtze River. If the Communist army crosses the Yangtze River, nothing can be discussed."

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] It is reported that the draft peace agreement of eight articles and twenty-four clauses brought back by Huang Shaohong from Beiping is now being secretly studied by the government. Acting President Li, Premier He, Zhang Qun, Bai Chongxi, Yan Xishan, Wu Zhongxin, Xu Yongchang, etc., have been in close contact for the 16th and 17th, discussing countermeasures. It is reported that Wu Tiecheng, who is in Shanghai, has gone to Xikou at the invitation of Acting President Li to ask President Chiang for instructions on the draft peace agreement in order to make a final decision. The CCP requires signing on April 20th. The government's countermeasure will be decided as soon as possible before the 20th, and then Huang Shaohong will be sent to Beiping to continue negotiations with the CCP by the government delegation.

### After the Government's Countermeasures are Determined, Huang Shaohong will Immediately Return to Beiping. There is No Problem with the Third Party's Transportation to Beiping.

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] Huang Shaohong's return to Beiping will be delayed. He will wait in Nanjing for the government's decision on the draft peace agreement proposed by the CCP. During Huang's stay in Beiping, he held meetings every day or had contact with people from all walks of life, which did not end until 2:00 a.m. or 4:00 a.m. He was overworked and his blood pressure rose sharply. After returning to Nanjing on the 16th, because all the reports were written documents, Huang only gave a brief explanation, and then Acting President Li and Premier He studied them together. Huang Shaohong plans to have a full rest in the next few days. On the morning of the 17th, in addition to attending Yu Youren's birthday celebration, he only went to He Yingqin's official residence for a meeting and then returned to Fuhougang for rest.

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] Regarding the CCP's invitation to third-party figures such as Zhang Lan to go to Beiping, the government has agreed to provide transportation convenience. The government will provide airplanes for those who accept the CCP's invitation and want to go. It is reported that the CCP's invitation was forwarded by the government delegation, and the government has informed Zhang et al. that in addition to the people designated by the CCP, it also stated that if there are remaining seats on the plane to Beiping, anyone who wants to go can go. In addition to Zhang Lan, Luo Longji, Ye Duyi, Shi Liang, Yang Weiyu, Leng, etc., there are also Guo Zeshen, Luo Hanxian, and Wang Genzhong.

### The Price of a Cup of Tea in a Beiping Dance Hall is 100 People's Currency

[Our Dispatch] This reporter recently met with the personnel on the China National Aviation Corporation's aircraft No. 515 who returned to Shanghai from Beiping the day before yesterday. I would like to briefly describe the recent situation in Beiping:

After they arrived in Beiping, they stayed at the Six Nations Hotel, and the expenses were paid by the CCP. The food was very good, and they could choose between Chinese and Western food, and there was no shortage of chicken, duck, fish, and meat. Their movements were also very free.

The clothing of the CCP's senior leaders is very ordinary, and even close to tattered. What they saw, such as Ye Jianying, from the outside, you would never think that he is a general.

There is now air traffic between Beiping and Jinan and Zhengzhou. There are C46 aircraft flying between Beiping and Jinan, and C47 aircraft flying between Beiping and Zhengzhou.

The Beiping market is stable but depressed. Most shops have sluggish business. Most of the people on the street are dressed plainly, and women mostly wear cloth clothes. However, luxury goods can still be bought as long as you have money.

Dance halls are still open, and the price of tea is 100 people's currency per cup. A gentleman spent three hours inside and gave the dancer 300 people's currency.

The exchange rate between gold yuan and people's currency has recently been 120 to 1. One silver dollar is equivalent to 230 people's currency.

### Bai Chongxi's Nephew Accompanied Huang Shaohong to Nanjing.

Hai Jingqiang was Released after Being Captured and Sent Back.

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] Accompanying Huang Shaohong on the special plane to Nanjing on the 16th was Hai Jingqiang, Bai Chongxi's nephew. Hai was the commander of a certain division. He was captured while fighting with the Communist army and was recently released and sent back. Hai was considered a mysterious guest at the airport because he refused to reveal his name.

### The Xinxiang Post Office Sends a Representative to Contact the Communist Side to Open Postal Services.

[Our Dispatch from Xinxiang on the 16th] The local post office sent inspector Wang Zhicheng and a postman on the 14th, carrying the post office's official letter and a small amount of mail, to Xiaoji Town to discuss technical issues of postal communication between the Kuomintang and Communist areas with the Communist side. The post office hopes that the Communist side will assist in opening a postal route between Xinxiang and Xiaoji. If the Communist side agrees, the Anyang Post Office also plans to contact the Communist side to discuss postal services.

### Smuggling Gold from Hong Kong to Guangzhou

A Thousand Taels Seized on the Yuehan Train

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 17th] The Industrial and Commercial Evening News today reported that, according to customs sources, the smuggling of gold from Hong Kong to Guangzhou is extremely rampant. On the 16th alone, the Yuehai Customs seized one thousand taels of smuggled gold on the Yuehan train, breaking the previous record. It is said that a certain Hong Kong merchant's branch in Guangzhou was seized with more than 400 taels. It is reported that the number of smugglers is even greater, estimated to be more than 20,000 taels. The Hong Kong gold and silver trading market recently decided by a vote of 27 to 24 to suspend gold trading for today and tomorrow, pending a request to the Financial Secretary to improve the regulations before deciding on the business policy. It is generally expected that the gold market will move to Macau.

### Guangzhou Detains Silver Dollars Transported to Guangxi. The Pacification Headquarters Has Agreed to Release Them.

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] The Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters' detention of silver dollars was resolved on the 17th after Premier He telegraphed Guangzhou to discuss the matter. These silver dollars were transported by the Central Bank to Guangzhou for transshipment to Guilin, Liuzhou, and other places to pay military salaries. After learning of the detention, the Guangxi Provincial Assembly and people's organizations expressed great indignation and are said to be making serious representations. The Pacification Headquarters has agreed to release them.

### Yu Youren's 71st Birthday. Acting President Li Personally Went to Congratulate Him Yesterday Morning. In the Evening, He Treated Reporters with Guilin Yuan in His Residence.

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] The 17th was the 71st birthday of President Yu Youren. President Yu's residence at No. 2 Ningxia Road was filled with guests from morning to night on the 17th. In the morning, Mr. Yu was dressed in a long gown and mandarin jacket, and greeted guests with a smile. Acting President Li personally went to congratulate him at 10:00 a.m. When Mr. Yu shook hands, he repeatedly said, "I dare not, I dare not!" His demeanor was extremely modest. He Yingqin, Zhang Qun, Huang Shaohong, Yan Xishan, Bai Chongxi, Tong Guanshen, Weng Wenhao, Xu Yongchang, Liu Gongyun, Li Huang, Hang Liwu, Duanmu Jie, Zhang Zhiben, Sun Yueqi, Huang Shaogu, Chen Kewen, and hundreds of members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan all went to congratulate him. Mr. Yu attended a birthday banquet with friends at Ma Xiang at noon, and in the afternoon, he visited the Mausoleum and strolled on Meihua Mountain to admire the cherry blossoms. He was very happy. In the evening, he prepared Guilin Yuan in his residence to entertain news reporters who came to congratulate him. Mr. Yu said to reporters with a smile: "I want to avoid it every year, but I can't avoid it. My hands are swollen from shaking hands. This year is better, my hands are not swollen."

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] Yu Youren's trip to Beiping has been postponed again and again. He stated on the 17th that the plan brought back by Huang Shaohong still needs to be studied by the government, so he will not leave in a day or two.

### The Battle Situation North of the Yangtze River is Apparently Relaxed but Secretly Tense. The Communist Army is Busy with New Deployments. The National Army Abandoned the Gaoqiao Stronghold Again Yesterday.

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] The battle situation north of the Yangtze River is apparently relaxed but secretly tense. Chen Yi and Chen Geng's troops have been busy with deployments in recent days, and seem to be actively engaged in new deployments to prepare for a new offensive. In addition, more than 10,000 Communist troops have recently arrived in the Dahekou Donggou Town area across from Longtan, and the National Army's forces in Huazikou and the south bank have also been strengthened.

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] Three regiments of the 16th Army of the Communist Army belonging to Chen Yi's troops, about 8,000 people, suddenly advanced towards the National Army's Gaoqiao bridgehead from the Sanjiangying Touqiao Town area starting in the evening of the 16th. At the same time, they concentrated seven heavy artillery pieces to bombard the Dagang Longshan area on the south bank, in order to cut off the National Army's retreat from Gaoqiao and block the National Army's reinforcements from the south bank. After a regiment of the garrison force of the bridgehead, under the command of Que Hanqian, fought bravely to resist, by dawn on the 17th, due to the disparity in numbers, they took the initiative to withdraw to the south bank under the cover of naval vessels. At this point, the Gaoqiao bridgehead and Laozhou, which had been recovered by the National Army for only four days, were completely abandoned again.

[Our Dispatch from Zhenjiang on the 17th] The battle across the river from Dagang, Zhenjiang, has started again. Since about 10:00 p.m. on the 16th, the Communist army has launched a fierce attack on the defense area of the Sifangqiao garrison with two regiments. The fighting had not stopped by the afternoon of the 17th. In addition, the Sanjiangying Xinzhou Gaoqiao area in the northeast across the river was attacked again by the 26th Army and the 23rd Army of the Communist Army with more than two regiments. Starting at 9:00 p.m. on the 16th, they began to bombard with artillery. The garrison fought bravely to resist, and the artillery fire was extremely fierce. The Gaoqiao position was fought back and forth many times. In the fierce battle until the evening of the 17th, the garrison had taken the initiative to withdraw, and the area fell into the hands of the Communist army again. At the time of reporting, the fighting was still continuing in Sanjiangying and Xinzhou, while Liuyi, Shierwei, and Guazhou were calm.

[Our Dispatch from Zhenjiang on the 17th] At about 4:00 a.m. on the 17th, the Communist army fired many shells at the south bank from Laozhou. Three shells landed and exploded on Guishan Mountain on the south bank, with unknown losses.

[Our Dispatch from Wuhu on the 17th] On the 16th and 17th, there were only sparse artillery battles in the Qipan Mountain area of the Agricultural School in the eastern suburbs of Anqing. A large number of Communist army ships were seen in Zongyang across the river in the northwest of Guichi and Shankou in the west of Anqing, and Huayang in the south of Wangjiang, as if they were preparing to cross the river at any time after the peace talks broke down.

[United Press, San Francisco, 16th] The CCP radio station in Beiping broadcasted today that the Fourth Field Army stationed in Beiping has set off south to join other field armies concentrated on the north bank of the Yangtze River to prepare to cross the river and complete the final liberation of all of China.

[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] The fighting along the Yangtze River remained at a standstill today, awaiting the final result of the peace talks. There was only artillery fire near Anqing, where the Communist army concentrated a large number of ships for future use in crossing the river.

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] A senior military general stated on the 17th, when discussing the Communist army's request to cross the river, that the Communist army hoped to cross the river peacefully because they also realized the unreliability of crossing the river by force. According to his estimates based on actual figures, the Communist army can support it for a maximum of three months if they continue to fight, while the National Army can support it for at least six months. The reason is that the Communist side also feels economic difficulties and is particularly short of ammunition supplies. The senior general believes that it is not easy for the Communist army to cross the river by force. After several months of rest and reorganization, the strength of the National Army has gradually recovered. At present, one army of the National Army is enough to deal with two armies of the Communist Army. He believes that the Yangtze River's natural barrier can still be defended, but the command must be unified, especially all the material, financial, and human resources in the south of the Yangtze River must be used in a concentrated manner, then the Communist army's dream of crossing the river by force will be difficult to realize.

### Fierce Battles Continue in the Suburbs of Taiyuan. The Communist Army Has Not Made an Inch of Progress.

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] Military News: The Communist army's troops under Nie Rongzhen and Xu Xiangqian continued to attack the suburbs of Taiyuan from the night of the 16th. Because the Communist army has suffered heavy casualties in the past two days, today the National Army's positions in Sanershu, Guadigou, Yangjiabao, and Qinxiantown in the east of the city continued to be attacked by more than 200 Communist infantrymen, all of whom were repelled. The rest were mainly artillery fire, so many residents in the urban area were killed and injured. At noon on the 17th, there was no change in the position. In addition, the airport west of Taiyuan City was also bombarded by heavy artillery fire by the Communist army today, but the planes can still barely land.

### Acting President Li Consults the Legislative Yuan on the Appointment of Zhang Chengyu as Auditor-General.

The Legislative Yuan Will Exercise the Right of Consent at a Regular Meeting.

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] Acting President Li's nomination of Zhang Chengyu to fill the position of Auditor-General of the Audit Department has been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for consent in accordance with the law. The Legislative Yuan will hold its second extraordinary meeting at 9:00 a.m. on the 24th to exercise the right of consent. The text of Acting President Li's letter is as follows: "The position of Auditor-General of the Audit Department, Lin Yungaai, is vacant due to illness and needs to be filled by a replacement to take responsibility. There is now one person, Zhang Chengyu, age 65, from Hubei Province, a graduate of the Department of Political Economy of Washington University in the United States. He has a pure character and profound knowledge. He devoted himself to the revolution in 1911 and made outstanding contributions. He then served as the Director of the Audit Office, Permanent Deputy Minister, and Director of the Audit Offices of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Hubei for more than 20 years, with outstanding performance. It is appropriate to appoint him as Auditor-General. In accordance with the provisions of Article 104 of the Constitution, I hereby submit this to your esteemed Yuan for consent in order to appoint him. This is hereby submitted to the Legislative Yuan, Acting President Li Zongren."

### Studying Fundamental Solutions to Stabilize Finance

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] According to financial authority sources: Financial officials have already begun to study fundamental solutions to stabilize finance. The authorities have also considered and discussed with experts the rampant rumors of implementing the silver standard and issuing silver dollar notes. However, the implementation of any standard system must have sufficient preparation, and the government must have sufficient strength. At the same time, it must be started in coordination with other conditions. When Finance Minister Liu Gongyun attended the Legislative Yuan to report the other day, he also mentioned the silver standard system. Mr. Liu believes that the current expenditure requires 120 million silver coins per month, so there are still difficulties in implementing it.

### Senator McCarran Accuses Acheson of Opposing Aid to Asia. Apparently Showing Weakness to the Soviet Union. The Claim that US Aid to China Exceeds 2 Billion is Definitely Not True.

[United Press, Washington, 16th] Democratic Senator McCarran today accused the State Department of opposing any proposals regarding aid to Asia to stem the tide of communism, "apparently showing weakness to the Soviet Union." Mr. McCarran is the initiator of the new $1.5 billion aid to China bill. Earlier, Republican Senator Bridges expressed extreme anger at Secretary of State Acheson's attitude and demanded that Congress thoroughly investigate the Secretary of State's China policy. Mr. McCarran then made the above statement. It is said that "at this time when the State Department is following in the footsteps of communist propaganda and recognizing that the CCP leader Mao Zedong is not a true communist, we must do something. Secretary Acheson's reply yesterday was both inaccurate and misleading. The so-called total US aid to China since victory has exceeded $2 billion is definitely not true. According to accurate statistics, the total amount of military aid that has been implemented is only $110 million, including those that have not been implemented, it is only $235 million. Among them, the materials stipulated in last year's April $125 million military aid to China bill did not start to be shipped until October, so that the Chinese government could not be assisted in time to resist the large-scale offensive of the Communist army, which resulted in the current situation. The State Department is making every effort to aid Europe to resist communism, while strongly opposing any proposals to aid Asia to stem the tide of communism, which is difficult to understand. My proposal to aid the Chinese government is not to serve China, but based on the interests of the United States itself, there is an urgent need to take active action against communism in Asia. If communism dominates all of China, it will further dominate all of Asia. If Japan cannot obtain the Chinese market and food, the United States will be forced to abandon its position in Japan because it cannot supply the 85 million people of Japan with food and industrial products. Once the United States withdraws from Japan, the Japanese people will either starve to death or embrace communism, there is no other way. After communism dominates Japan, the second step is to dominate the Philippines. If the United States continues to stand by, it will definitely lose its leadership position in world peace and democracy, and its great efforts to revive Western Europe to resist communism will be in vain."

[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] Secretary of State Acheson's letter to the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 16th drew fierce criticism from those who advocated aid to China, but observers believe that unless some Democrats join forces with the Republicans, Congress will not take immediate action.

[United Press, Washington, 16th] State Department Press Officer McDermott declined to comment on Democratic Senator McCarran's statement on the 16th, stating that to the best of his knowledge, no one in the State Department had ever said that Mao Zedong was not a true communist.

### Lapham Leaves the United States to Return to China.

[United Press, San Francisco, 17th] Lapham, Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration's China Branch, returned to China by Pan American Airlines yesterday with his wife, after several weeks of returning to the United States for instructions.

### Financial and Economic Difficulties are Overwhelming. Liu Gongyun Asks to Resign as Finance Minister. Premier He Has Personally Instructed Him to Endure.

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] Finance Minister and Governor of the National Bank Liu Gongyun went to Doujizha on the morning of the 17th to meet with Premier He to report on the current financial and economic situation and its difficulties. He spent a long time before leaving. It is said that Mr. Liu has expressed his request to resign to Premier He in person due to the current overwhelming financial and economic difficulties. When this reporter interviewed Mr. Liu in the afternoon of the 17th, he frankly admitted that the current situation is really difficult to handle. Although he was unwilling to confirm the resignation matter, he did not deny it either. It is also learned that Premier He deeply understands the financial difficulties described by Mr. Liu, and has personally instructed Mr. Liu to endure and hope that he will not consider resigning.

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th] Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Service Command Guo Chan visited Finance Minister Liu Gongyun on the afternoon of the 17th to discuss the issue of improving the treatment of soldiers and paying salaries in silver dollars. He left after about an hour. Mr. Liu has completed his official business in Nanjing and returned to Shanghai by train on the night of the 17th.

[Our Dispatch from Changsha on the 17th] The Central Bank of Guangzhou was ordered to transport 39 boxes of silver, each weighing 200 catties, to Xiang, Jiangxi, Liuzhou, and other places. It was detained by the Guangdong authorities at the airport on the 14th. Among this batch of silver, one million silver dollars were transported to Changsha to compensate for the loss of gold previously transported.

Editorial

### The Problem of Merging the Central and Communications Banks

During the first session of the Legislative Yuan last year, Member Wang Lihang and others proposed the issue of acquiring the commercial shares of the Central, Communications, and Farmers Banks. At that time, due to the turbulent times, it was inconvenient to make many changes, and this part of the opinion was not adopted. Unexpectedly, after more than half a year, Wang and others brought up the old matter again and proposed reorganizing the Central and China Banks and abolishing the Communications, Farmers, Trust, Postal, and Cooperative Banks and Treasuries. In addition, in the original proposal, except for retaining the old names of the reorganized Central Bank and Bank of China, all the others had to start anew, which was no different from merging. In the current situation of great instability and financial turmoil, whether the system of the above-mentioned banks and treasuries should be changed immediately deserves our attention.

The focus of Wang Lihang's original proposal was first that the state-owned and commercial shareholders, directors, and supervisors of state banks were monopolized by a small number of people, and the financial power of these directors and supervisors exceeded the power of the state, thus harming the country and the people. Secondly, Wang and others believed that the current financial chaos and economic decline were entirely the fault of the state banks, and the behind-the-scenes instigators of the state banks were those wealthy tycoons who controlled the commercial shares, so the commercial shares of the state banks must be recovered. Finally, Wang and others pointed out that there are currently as many as eight state banks in name, with large institutions and numerous personnel, resulting in overlapping business and wasting public funds, so there is a need for merging. Wang's various arguments were not without pointing out the shortcomings of the time, but there were fundamental problems in the basics.

Looking at the historical development process of state banks in our country, it is clear that the Central and Communications Banks have become one. Before the 17th year of the Republic of China, they were the banks that actually grasped the task of the state bank, and their impression in the minds of the general public was deeper. The history of the Central and Communications Banks is more than 40 years. The predecessor of the Bank of China was the Ministry of Household Bank and the Bank of Great Qing of the late Qing Dynasty. The Bank of Communications has not changed its name from beginning to end. Before the establishment of the Central Bank, the two banks were agents of the national treasury and enjoyed the right of issuance, actually holding the lifeline of our country's finance at that time. It is still remembered that in the early days of the Northern Expedition, in the extremely chaotic financial situation, they led commercial banks to compete with foreign banks on the one hand, and issued banknotes to maintain credit and stabilize finance on the other hand, thereby stabilizing people's hearts in society, and contributed greatly to the success of the Northern Expedition. When the Central Bank was first established in the 17th year, due to the lack of credit of the Central Bank, the tide of bank runs swept the country, and they also supported the Central Bank to overcome the difficulties. As for the repeated abolishment of the tael and the reform of the yuan, the reform of the legal currency, the issuance of bonds, and the management of foreign exchange, to be fair, if there were no help from the two banks, I am afraid it would not have been as smooth as ideal. Furthermore, the unified issuance in the early days of the War of Resistance was also due to the clear understanding of the great righteousness of the two banks, which indeed increased the strength of the War of Resistance. It is not that we are deliberately defending, but those who discuss great things should have some fairness.

In recent years, the so-called crimes of wealthy families have already been portrayed by everyone, but it is precisely because of this that almost everyone can put the hat of wealthy families on those they hate. Here, what we want to discuss is whether all the directors and supervisors of the national banks and bureaus are wealthy families? According to the law, the directors and supervisors of the Central and Communications Banks have always been appointed by the government for state-owned shares, and commercial shares must also be approved by the government before they can be produced. If these directors and supervisors have indeed become wealthy families because of the Central and Communications Banks, then their guilt should lie in the improper administrative measures in the past. Moreover, not all directors and supervisors are necessarily wealthy families. In addition, from an objective point of view, after the War of Resistance, the cancellation of the agency rights of the Central and Communications Banks, the transfer of deposits and foreign exchange of military and political organs, and all privileges have long been lost. In addition, the deposit and loan interest rates and the use of head positions are all subject to strict control by the financial authorities, while the Ministry of Finance takes what it wants, and the Central Bank issues banknotes without restrictions. The result of harming the country and the people lies here and not there. Furthermore, the establishment of the Central and Communications Banks did not begin today, and the so-called emergence of wealthy families is a matter of recent years. Why did the two banks not produce wealthy families in the past, but now they have suddenly deteriorated? Moreover, before the 17th year of the Republic of China, the proportion of capital of the Central and Communications Banks was two official shares and eight commercial shares. At that time, most of the strength was in the hands of the commercial shareholders, but there were no wealthy families. Now that most of the strength is in the hands of the government, is it a miracle that wealthy families have emerged? Therefore, if we deduce from the logic of Wang and others' proposal, then if we really want to overthrow wealthy families today, all the state-owned shares of other state banks, except for the Central Bank, should withdraw to avoid the involvement of wealthy families and eliminate the crime of disrupting finance, and thus become true national capital.

To go a step further, as shareholders of the Central and Communications Banks, they have not only not benefited from the banks in the past few years, but also suffered considerable losses in their due interests due to the frequent wars and the government's repeated exploitation of the rights and interests of the two banks. For example, the composition of state-owned and commercial shares of the Central and Communications Banks was originally two official shares and eight commercial shares in the early years of the Republic of China. In the 24th year, the Bank of China was changed to half state-owned and half commercial, and the Bank of Communications was changed to six official shares and four commercial shares. When the two banks increased their capital in the 31st year, due to the War of Resistance, the commercial shareholders were scattered in various places and could not handle it at the same time. As a result, only the state-owned shares increased. As a result, the state-owned shares of the Bank of China increased to more than 60%, and the commercial shares decreased to 33%; the state-owned shares of the Bank of Communications increased to 86%, and the commercial shares decreased to 13%. Furthermore, the capital of each increase in state-owned shares did not actually pay cash, but only used some public debt and other head positions to offset it, which is by no means comparable to the silver dollars paid by the commercial shares in those years. What is the true value of public debt now? God knows... During the currency reform of August 19th in the tenth year, the foreign exchange head positions of the two banks were all deposited in the Central Bank, and the contributions of handling military and political free remittances and low-interest national policy loans for the government over the years can also be said to be the infinite exploitation of the original commercial shares. Based on these many factors, the income of state banks has become relatively reduced. We have seen that the dividends paid by the Central and Communications Banks in recent years are far less than the profits of other investments, which can prove that this situation is true. The reason why commercial shareholders have endured the losses of investment for so many years is nothing more than hoping that the Central and Communications Banks can have a day of revival after peace. Now there is a strange argument that disregards the previous assets of the bank and酌give a price, forcibly ordering the commercial shares to take back the capital, which will not only sweep away the credit of the government? Such long-term agitation will inevitably make the people regard all businesses that cooperate with the government as a fear, what benefit is there to the government?

In fact, state capital and wealthy family capital are inherently different. State capital is a kind of capital controlled by the government, and the government can be responsible for deciding all the policies of its investment business. On the contrary, wealthy family capital is a private product, and all interests depend on their own manipulation. Today, although there are commercial shares in the name of the Central and Communications Banks, because the directors and supervisors are appointed by the government, the actual power is still controlled by the government. If you want to improve the personnel of the Central and Communications Banks, you can do it with just one order. Why bother to reorganize and merge? Moreover, the Central and Communications Banks have good credit in the past and have branches abroad, which will undoubtedly be more convenient for absorbing overseas Chinese remittances and handling industrial and commercial import and export guarantees. If they are reorganized into purely state-owned banks, according to international practice, their foreign branches will hardly be able to stand, which is not what wise people should take. Furthermore, regarding the system of the bank itself, the world trend has all tended towards specialization. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France need not be mentioned, but even the socialist Soviet Union can never be an exception? Therefore, the proposal of Wang and others to turn the specialized national banks and treasuries back into general-purpose banks is theoretically inconsistent with the current trend.

In short, in this turbulent period, except for illegal and unreasonable institutions, it is absolutely not appropriate to make many changes, especially changes that disregard objectivity and rely solely on subjectivity. Changes become the source of chaos, and the more they change, the more chaotic they become. Isn't the financial world the same? Judging from the current financial situation in our country, we should seek to establish national credit, give full play to the effectiveness of existing institutions, abolish all rigid control laws that easily cause capital to escape, thereby win the hearts of the people, absorb overseas Chinese capital, and increase national wealth. On the contrary, if we abandon the fundamentals and pursue the trivial, we may not be able to achieve much effect. With the current emptiness of the national treasury, the financial deficit, and the insufficiency of political expenses and all expenses, where can there be the remaining power to acquire the commercial shares of various national banks? If we use increased issuance as the capital for acquisition, will it not deepen the suffering of the people? Therefore, we believe that the current measures to roughly change or merge the national banks and treasuries are of no benefit to reality. The only way for the government to do now is to quickly use the history and reputation of the Central and Communications Banks to create a brand new page in financial history, which is the smooth path to stabilizing finance.

[Our newspaper, Changsha, 17th] The bandits outside Wusu in the northwest of Yuanling have been attacking us every day since the 14th, taking advantage of dusk and dawn.

### Lu Han reports on the bandit situation in Yunnan, believing that it can be cleared within three months.

[Our newspaper, Kunming, 16th] Amidst the rumors of the expansion of banditry in Yunnan, the provincial security authorities held a tea party for the press at noon on the 16th, presided over by Chairman Lu Han himself. Lu said: The banditry in Yunnan is not as rampant as rumored. The main reason for the riots in various places is actually the turbulent political situation and the uneasiness of the people. Speculators incited the riots from the middle, and the weapons possessed by the local bullies in various counties are far superior to the local teams. Therefore, they often use their superior conditions to make things difficult for the local leaders. Over time, their power expands, making it even more difficult to suppress the bandits. They echoed each other and colluded with each other, making it difficult to encircle and suppress them. In fact, the main force of the scattered bandits does not exceed the strength of a battalion of the national army. Heavy troops have been dispatched to the south and west to increase defense. The 26th Army is also cooperating in the suppression. After the security teams are transferred back for reorganization and training, they can reinforce various places. The scattered bandits who fled are not worth mentioning. Lu told the reporters in a firm tone that he believed that the banditry in Yunnan could be cleared within three months.

### Salutes, Church Bells, and Jubilation; The Republic of Ireland is Born; Millions Celebrate Through the Night; President O'Kelly Assumes Power and Reviews Troops This Morning

[Reuters, Dublin, 18th Dispatch] Twenty-one gun salutes from O'Connell Bridge in Dublin at midnight yesterday, the simultaneous ringing of church bells, and the cheers of millions of people across the country marked the birth of the independent Republic of Ireland. Dozens of powerful searchlights in Dublin cast white beams of light that wove intricate patterns in the sky. Most of the Irish people stayed awake last night to celebrate Ireland's departure from the British Commonwealth. The Irish in London also joined in the celebrations of their compatriots at midnight. Starting at midnight, Irish President O'Kelly began to assume all the powers over Ireland previously held by King George VI of England. From that time on, Irish people in Britain and those serving in the British armed forces technically became "foreigners," although according to prior understandings, this issue will be determined at a later date. This morning, the Irish tricolor was raised high above the government buildings and at the site of the 1916 uprising by two thousand Irish Republican volunteers. Four bronze plaques hung in front of the Post Office, representing the four provinces of Ireland, including the "lost" province of Ulster in Northern Ireland. After reviewing the troops this morning, President O'Kelly hosted the diplomatic corps at his official residence in Phoenix Park in the afternoon, and held a grand ball at Dublin Castle in the evening. New York, a city with a strong Irish identity, also celebrated the independence of the Republic of Ireland across the Atlantic. New York Mayor O'Dwyer, of Irish descent, gave a speech urging the British to withdraw from Northern Ireland to complete the unification of Ireland. Britain has accepted Ireland's complete departure from the British Commonwealth with magnanimity. The British High Commissioner's Office in Dublin was closed at midnight and replaced by an embassy. However, no celebrations were permitted in Northern Ireland, and the authorities were on high alert to prevent accidents.

[United Press, New Delhi, 17th Dispatch] On the eve of the birth of the Republic of Ireland, Indian Prime Minister Nehru sent a congratulatory telegram to Irish Prime Minister Costello.

### Iran-Soviet Relations Increasingly Tense; Soviet Union Closes Consulate in Azerbaijan Province; Iranian Ambassador to the US Explains Soviet-Iranian Treaty

[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 17th Broadcast: Deriran News: Soviet Consul General in Tabriz, the capital of Azerbaijan Province, Krakhnik, has closed his consulate and led all staff back to the Soviet Union. At the same time, Soviet consulate staff in Makou, Astara, and Rezaiyeh in Azerbaijan Province have also returned to the Soviet Union with Krakhnik.

[Reuters, Washington, 16th Dispatch] A spokesman for the Iranian Embassy here said that if the Soviet Union has any dissatisfaction with Iran or the presence of a US military mission in Iran, it should appeal to the United Nations under the UN Charter. The Iranian government believes that Article VI of the 1921 Soviet-Iranian Treaty, which allows Soviet troops to enter Iran under certain circumstances, has been superseded by the UN Charter's provisions for dealing with threats to peace and security. Article VI of the 1921 Soviet-Iranian Treaty stipulated that if a third party intended to use Iranian territory as a base for operations against the Soviet Union, threatening the Soviet border, and the Iranian government, after being urged by the Soviet Union to pay attention and take action, was still unable to prevent such a threat to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union had the right to send troops into Iran. Since the creation of the UN Charter, a UN organization has been in place to deal with all threats to peace and security, and the provisions of Article VI are no longer applicable. The statement by the Iranian Embassy was made after reports that the Soviet and Iranian governments had exchanged notes several times regarding the presence of a US military mission in Iran and Iran's opposition to frequent Soviet pressure on Iran. However, the Iranian Embassy spokesman also stated that the Iranian Embassy had not received any reports on the exchange of notes between the Soviet Union and Iran, and that the spokesman's remarks were only a general clarification of the Iranian government's position on the issue.

### Trial Run of Direct Beijing-Guangzhou Train Commences; First Train Passes Through South Shanghai; Fare Increases and Currency Shortage Affect Ridership

[Our Newspaper Report] After several setbacks and numerous false starts, the direct Beijing-Guangzhou train service, with the determination of the Ministry of Transportation, finally commenced its trial run yesterday. The train departed Nanjing at 10:00 AM and arrived at the North Station in this city on time at 4:45 PM. Before departure, Minister of Transportation Duanmu Jie personally presided over the departure ceremony. Deputy Director Li of the Ministry of Transportation's Intermodal Transportation Department, Section Chief Kang, Deputy Director Shen Entao of the two railway bureaus, and Deputy Director Liu Shizhong of the Transportation Department arrived in Shanghai with the train. The train stopped in Shanghai for three hours and thirty minutes and continued its journey at 8:15 PM. Because the national railway adjusted fares yesterday, the originally set fares could not be applied. The Ministry of Transportation temporarily changed them. A sleeper ticket from Beijing to Guangzhou costs a whopping 7.4 million (currency), and a sleeper ticket from Shanghai to Guangzhou also requires 6.654 million (currency). Moreover, yesterday was also Sunday, and cash was required to purchase tickets, so some registered passengers had to abandon their plans to travel south because they could not gather so much cash on short notice. Ridership was extremely poor yesterday. Half of the third-class tickets were sold, about 30-40% of the second-class tickets, and very few first-class tickets. However, tickets presold the day before were not subject to additional charges. The new fares are recorded as follows:

Shanghai to Jinhua: First Class 666,000 (currency), Second Class 444,000 (currency). Quzhou: First Class 701,000 (currency), Second Class 534,000 (currency), Third Class 267,000 (currency). Shangrao: First Class 1,002,000 (currency), Second Class 668,000 (currency), Third Class 334,000 (currency). Nanchang: First Class 1,322,000 (currency), Second Class 948,000 (currency), Third Class 474,000 (currency). Zhangshu: First Class 1,572,000 (currency), Second Class 1,048,000 (currency), Third Class 524,000 (currency). Pingxiang: First Class 1,926,000 (currency), Second Class 1,288,000 (currency), Third Class 642,000 (currency). Zhuzhou: First Class 1,971,000 (currency), Second Class 1,314,000 (currency), Third Class 659,000 (currency). Liling: First Class 1,977,000 (currency), Second Class 1,318,000 (currency), Third Class 659,000 (currency). Hengyang: First Class 2,343,000 (currency), Second Class 1,562,000 (currency), Third Class 781,000 (currency). Shaoguan: First Class 2,766,000 (currency), Second Class 1,848,000 (currency), Third Class 922,000 (currency). Guangzhou: First Class 3,426,000 (currency), Second Class 2,284,000 (currency), Third Class 1,142,000 (currency).

### Rising Winds Blow Through Vegetable Markets: Pork and Beef at 60,000 per Jin, Seasonal Goods Priced in Silver Dollars

[Our Report] Yesterday's rain saw the rising winds blow through the small vegetable markets again. All kinds of meat and vegetable dishes saw crazy price increases, generally doubling or tripling within a day or two. Pork and beef have already been raised to 60,000 yuan per jin. Seasonal goods, such as large prawns, are even being priced in Yuan Shikai silver dollars, valued at 3 jiao per pair. The price is converted to Gold Yuan Certificates based on the market price of Yuan Shikai silver dollars at the time of purchase, which was 54,000 yuan per pair yesterday morning. Furthermore, numerous "silver bulls" (speculators) have recently infiltrated the vegetable markets early in the morning, holding cash to buy Yuan Shikai silver dollars from housewives' savings. Therefore, the market price of Yuan Shikai silver dollars in the vegetable markets can be readily ascertained with a simple inquiry. Only the seasonal small yellow croaker fish remains relatively stable in price, ranging from 4,000 to 6,000 yuan per jin. Fish like bluefish and mandarin fish are priced at over 1,000 yuan per liang, making them luxury items for wealthy families. Chicken and duck eggs are priced in several tiers, ranging from 4,000 to 6,000 yuan per egg depending on size. The price increases for vegetables are even more severe, with even the most basic small pond vegetables costing 2,000 yuan per jin, bamboo shoots at 6,000 yuan, hairy bamboo shoots at 4,000 yuan, and mung bean sprouts, sprouted beans, and pickled vegetables costing around 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per jin.

Moreover, yesterday was Foreign Qingming (All Souls' Day), and upper-class Christian families traditionally enjoy gifting Qingming eggs made of chocolate, the prices of which are even more astonishing. An ordinary egg-sized one costs 50,000 yuan, while slightly larger ones are priced as high as 300,000 yuan each.

### Index-Based Wage System No Longer Viable: Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Demands Change of Method

[Our Report] The alarming rate of devaluation of the Gold Yuan Certificate and the rampant rise in prices have made the cost of living index released by the municipal government mid-month an irony of the times. The city's more than one million wage earners who are paid according to the index can no longer bear the double burden of low wages and high prices. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has been secretly discussing this situation repeatedly in recent days. It is learned that the representatives of the Federation of Trade Unions raised the issue at the Municipal Government's Cost of Living Index Compilation Review Committee on the 15th of this month, requesting the establishment of a small committee to study future wage calculation standards. The current "average index" wage system can no longer be used, otherwise, it will lead to serious consequences. They also limited the small committee to convene a meeting within five days (before the 20th) to draft a concrete plan for future salary standards and submit it to the Municipal Affairs Conference for approval and implementation before the 30th of this month. At that time, the capital and government representatives on the Compilation and Review Committee believed that the authority of the Compilation and Review Committee was limited to the review of the compilation of the cost of living index and had no right to discuss this proposal. It was decided to authorize the Chief Statistician, Chu Yifei, to submit a request to the Acting Mayor of the Municipal Government to change the wage system. Yesterday, the person in charge of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions told our reporter: The city's industrial circles absolutely trust the scientific nature and accuracy of the index for the first half of this month, and the response of various industry trade unions to the index is also very good. However, this average index wage system can no longer be maintained. For example, on the 15th of this month, the price of rice in the city was 750,000 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure). A worker with a base salary of 50 yuan, whose salary is calculated according to an index of 15,140 times, would only receive 757,000 yuan, which is only enough to buy one shi of rice. When the currency reform was carried out on August 19 last year, 50 Gold Yuan could buy at least 2.5 shi of rice. The average index wage system has been eliminated by the times, as can be seen from this. He also said that the proposal of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions may not be discussed within five days, but he believes that a solution will be found before the end of this month.

### Social Bureau Improves Business and Public Interests: Formulates Rules for Managing Various Industry Markets

(12) If market transactions violate laws, regulations, or group bylaws, the Market Management Committee shall report to the Social Bureau for handling. (13) If disputes occur in market transactions, the Market Management Committee shall mediate. If necessary, a mediation committee may be formed to handle them. The articles of association and mediation rules of the aforementioned mediation committee shall be drafted separately by the Market Management Committee and submitted to the Social Bureau for approval and implementation. (14) The Social Bureau may assign personnel as needed to reside in each market to guide and supervise its transactions. (15) Market transaction prices and supply and sales conditions shall be reported to the Social Bureau for record on a daily or weekly basis.

Those who fail to obtain the certificate after the deadline shall have their original approval revoked and their transactions suspended.

Killing Without Remorse: Han Xiao Luo Hui

### Sheshan Commands the Nine Peaks: An Excellent Place for Spring Outings, Most Beautiful at Dusk with Dark Skies, Low Clouds, and a Gentle Evening Breeze

[Our Special Report] Sheshan, a spring outing destination only one and a half hours away from Shanghai, is probably not unfamiliar to most citizens. In the depths of April, the foot of the mountain is often filled with various cars from the city, and many people spend their weekends and holidays here.

From the perspective of appreciating scenery, Sheshan's ability to become a spring outing resort is not entirely due to having a church and an observatory that is famous in three provinces, but rather because it is the leader of the peaks, towering over the many surrounding mountains such as Chenshan, Luoshan, Xueshan, Tianmashan, Xiaojishan, and Fenghuangshan, dominating the center of the so-called "Nine Peaks" in the eastern area of ​​Taihu Lake. From the mountain ridge, looking into the distance, the peaks are connected in the misty clouds, quietly nestled against a large plain in Jiangnan. Occasionally, a canal is seen in the distance like a belt, reflecting three or five farmhouses, next to which are rapeseed flowers like brocade. This scenery is indeed enough to make people linger.

Evaluating the Nine Peaks of Sheshan: Evaluating the mountain scenery along the coast, the Nine Peaks of Sheshan are slightly inferior to the magnificence of Nanjing's mountains, slightly less elegant than the beauty of Wukang Mogan, the peaks of Lingyan and Tianping in Suzhou have a little more embellishment, the overall environment of Xiangshan in Beiping is more secluded and elegant, and like the mountainous areas of Sun Moon Lake in Taiwan, which have roads leading directly to the peaks, it seems to lack a bit of modern appearance. But this is already enough to please the urban children who are buried in trivial matters. Leaving in the morning and returning in the evening, half a day of fleeting life, a few hours of lingering, can at least dilute the dust of profit and desire.

The most beautiful realm of Sheshan is at dusk, with dark skies, low clouds, and a gentle evening breeze blowing through the thickets. A touch of red glow in the west reflects the silent wilderness. At this time, a priest occasionally walks by, his slender figure wrapped in a black robe, carrying a book, quietly climbing the mountain in the evening prayer bells. Those who have seen Wang Wei's "Riding through Jianmen in Fine Rain" will surely be able to appreciate this poetry.

Without a Hint of Vulgarity: Perhaps it is the good fortune of the lakes and mountains, but until now, the Sheshan Nine Peaks area has not been favored by vulgar merchants like the West Lake. It is indeed gratifying that there is no strong commercial atmosphere in the scenic area. Not to mention advertising signs and cafes, there is not even a decent cold drink stall at the foot of Sheshan. When the climbers are thirsty, the village women leading the oxen come up to sell water chestnuts, which is of course an irony for the urban children who come to enjoy the spring with a lot of Gold Yuan. It is precisely because of this that foreign tourists always account for more of the visitors to Sheshan in the spring and autumn seasons. Their way of traveling is exceptionally cheerful. As soon as they get off the car, they take off their shirts and climb the hillside without stone steps in groups. When they reach the top of the peak, they raise their hands towards the sky, and even the oldest people feel that they have become younger.

Several mountains in the Sheshan Nine Peaks are known for their production of stone. The annual construction projects of the Jiangnan seawall, the past renovation of Longhua Airport, and the cobblestone pavements of various roads in the city are all made of stone quarried from these mountains. There are two highways to Sheshan in Shanghai, Qinghu Road and Songhu Road. The road surface of the former is more ideal than the latter and is praised as a high-quality county road in Jiangsu Province. Its regular road maintenance work relies on the Sheshan stones, using local materials, so it can maintain the integrity of the road surface.

The Church on the Top of the Mountain Has Experienced the Vicissitudes of Life

The Catholic Church standing on Sheshan can also be said to be a building that has experienced the vicissitudes of life. At the top of the church is a bronze statue of Jesus, thousands of feet above the Pujiang River, looking down with his head bowed on the cross. For decades, he has seen the Northern Expeditionary Army marching through the foothills to capture Shanghai, and he has also seen Japanese soldiers shelling the national army positions on the opposite mountain. Now he has seen many local teams training at the foot of the mountain. The lakes and mountains remain the same, and the leisurely white clouds seem to always be testifying to the record of time, but the vicissitudes of life and the sadness of our generation are probably enough for Jesus to see!

### Fuel Imports Arrive in Endless Stream: Over 18,000 Tons of Coal Shipped to Shanghai One After Another, Flour-for-Coal Barter Exempted from Taxation by Communist Side

[Our Report] Although the source of fuel in the city has not been seen to be strong, imports are arriving in an endless stream. The Tangshan Wheel of the China Shipping Company arrived in Shanghai last Saturday from Qinhuangdao, carrying 6,800 tons of coal and 432 pieces of mail, and berthed at the Kaiping Wharf for unloading. The Dasheng Wheel of the Continental Company, carrying 3,800 tons of coal for the power company from Qinhuangdao, and the Fushen Wheel of the Fushen Company, carrying 2,700 tons of coal from Keelung, are both scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. The Russian ship Smolenay, carrying over 5,000 tons of coal from Vladivostok, was expected to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but it had not been seen to arrive by the evening. It is expected to arrive in port this morning, and it is scheduled to berth at Pier No. 1 of the Four Mines Joint Office (formerly the Mitsui Warehouse). In addition, the Panama Wheel Punis, managed by Texaco, carrying over 14,870 tons of diesel from the Persian Gulf, which was also purchased by the power company, was scheduled to arrive in port yesterday. Due to the bad weather, it did not arrive yesterday, and it is expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning. Previously, it was rumored that the Communist Party would levy import taxes on flour-for-coal barter. After the Wheel Association's best efforts to negotiate for exemption, it is said that after several discussions, the Communist Party has understood, and the number of transport ships has also increased from eight to fifteen. The above issues will be implemented as soon as the official document arrives. Nanqiang, Yongxing, and other ships are waiting for the solution before loading flour and continuing to sail to Qinhuangdao for coal barter. According to news from the shipping industry, in the future, in addition to flour-for-coal barter, it is also planned to use timber-for-coal barter, and negotiations are currently underway.

·Team Li Wins over Team Force·

The women's team match between team Li and team Force was the first match last night. Li team's Cai Mingxia and the Qian sisters scored five points in a row, and Yao Silian was also very brilliant.

Force team's Weng Xiayun and Fan Yuying scored three points with one free throw and one throw, returning the egg that was laid earlier, because the Li team also did not score in this quarter, and the audience burst into laughter. In the third quarter, Li team became fierce again. Force team's repeated changes did not work, resulting in 14-5.

In the fourth quarter, after Force team's Yao Wenda replaced Liang Miaozhen, they scored several goals in a row, causing the Li team to have a 'puzzled' expression. This time, the men's rules were adopted, and there was no sufficient publicity and preparation beforehand, so many teams could not 'cope with ease.' Several young players said themselves 'can't handle it.' In the end, team Li won by 24-14.
