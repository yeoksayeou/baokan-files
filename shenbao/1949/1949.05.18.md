However, according to other related sources, Taiwan Salt's exports to Japan have been in disagreement with the Allied General Headquarters in Tokyo due to quality and payment issues, so it was decided to temporarily suspend exports starting in May. It is reported that since Taiwan Salt resumed exports to Japan in February this year, it has exported a total of 56,756 tons, including 16,256 tons in February, 15,800 tons in March, and 24,600 tons in April.

### India-Soviet Union Negotiate New Trade Agreement

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 17th] It was announced here today that India and the Soviet Union are currently conducting negotiations to conclude a new trade agreement. India hopes to exchange jute, tea, and other items for Soviet grain. According to reports, there are already three types of agreements between India and the Soviet Union. India imports wheat and corn from the Soviet Union and exports tea and raw jute to the Soviet Union.

### Various Import and Export Firms Request Reduction of Dock Handling Fees

[Our Newspaper] Various import and export firms in this city believe that the dock handling fee rates for shipping goods were recently set by the Dock Industry Association, calculated at 2 million times the base amount, which is too high and unbearable. They have requested the Import and Export Industry Association to forward their request to the relevant authorities to order a reduction in order to lighten the burden on businesses. The industry association has prepared a document and sent it to the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Public Utilities Bureau, and the Dock Industry Association, requesting a reasonable revision and reduction. The original text is as follows: We have investigated that the dock handling fee rates for shipping goods in this city were originally adjusted at any time by the Up and Down Fee Rate Review Committee established by the Public Utilities Bureau based on the price increase. However, recently, the Shanghai Dock Business Association arbitrarily set the rates, calculated at 2 million times the base amount, which exceeds the cost of living index by as much as five and a half times, which is truly an unbearable burden for merchants. Our association has repeatedly received complaints from various members, requesting that we forward their request to the relevant authorities for effective prevention, etc. Upon investigation, various prices have been stable recently, but the pricing of handling fees is particularly high, which seems unreasonable. Moreover, at a time when the situation is tense and the government has issued an order to evacuate goods, shipping is frequent. If the handling fee rate is arbitrarily increased, it will not only increase the burden on merchants, but also be tantamount to obstructing the evacuation of materials. Therefore, we specially request your review and order the Dock Business Association to quickly and reasonably reduce the dock handling fee rate in order to lighten the burden on businesses and facilitate evacuation. We would be extremely grateful.

### Editorial: The Importance of Wartime Epidemic Prevention

This week is Shanghai's Public Health Week, initiated and hosted by the Health Bureau. Its main purposes are twofold: one is general hygiene, and the other is cleanliness. In this tense situation where the sound of artillery fire is deafening day and night, the health authorities are still calmly promoting public health. Its significance is great, and its value should be re-evaluated. During wartime, immigrants are frequent, the population is crowded in a few safe areas, citizens face economic difficulties, nutrition is insufficient, and medical care is inadequate. In addition, it is early summer, the climate is suddenly cold and hot, the humidity is high and the rainfall is abundant. These are all good opportunities for the breeding and spread of germs. Before the disease demons eagerly try to attack, giving them a head start with hygiene is a most economical and effective wise measure to prevent epidemics. Public health is a war, and all of our citizens must participate in this war to prevent epidemics and diseases.

The meaning of public health, as pointed out by hygienist Winslow, has two major focuses: one is to improve health, and the other is to prolong life. And its key is to control infectious diseases. There are two major problems in controlling infectious diseases: one is protecting the individual, and the other is protecting society. Society is the total accumulation of individuals, a complex mixture influenced by the masses, politics, and economics. It can easily spread epidemics, and it can also prevent epidemics. Therefore, policies to control individual diseases must be in line with the needs of the entire society. Public health focuses on society, but it does not neglect the individual. However, there is a distinction here: protecting the group is more important than protecting the individual. Sometimes, in order to protect the public, it is necessary to painfully sacrifice a few individuals.

History tells us that it takes three stages to achieve scientific control of infectious diseases. The first stage belongs to the religious stage; the second is the natural world stage, followed by the microbial stage. Mankind's concept of the source of disease and its transmission attitude initially thought that "Er Shu" and other ghosts and gods were at work, and later thought that the sun, moon, stars, climate, and environment were creating evil. By the end of the nineteenth century, the belief that epidemics were transmitted from person to person or from animals to humans began to sprout. The Old Testament Moses's public health regulations recognized that disease transmission was related to contact between people and people and between people and animals. Israelis prohibited children from eating pork or shellfish, taught people to properly handle feces, and not to associate with lepers. It was not until 1676 that the Dutchman Leeuwenhoek pointed out the existence of microorganisms and implied that this was the source of epidemics. In the mid-nineteenth century, Pasteur proved that epidemics were indeed caused by microorganisms, and epidemic prevention was greatly expanded. Today, many Chinese people are still stuck in our grandfather's century, still clueless about epidemics and mostly confined to superstition. This is the fatal wound of promoting public health. We must use more effort to enlighten and guide them.

Because medicine is developed, European and American countries do not hesitate to spend money on public health. They all believe that investing in public health is the most profitable investment. Therefore, infectious diseases have been reduced on the curve, and even have no place. Typhoid fever, cholera, diphtheria, dysentery, scarlet fever, and trachoma, which are prevalent in our country, have long been unique to them. To study these diseases, one cannot find a lot of materials without coming to the East. Mortality rates in Western Europe in 1946 and 1947 were lower than before the war. France's post-war mortality rate was the lowest in history. The situation in England, Wales, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Switzerland is all better than before. Only Germany does not work.

The United States called last year the Year of Health, and this year is even more advanced. Their average life expectancy is nearly sixty-seven years old, and the mortality rate has fallen by 40% in recent years. In 1900, the mortality rate was 17.2 per thousand people. In 1940, it dropped to 10.7. In 1947, it was reduced to 10.1. Below is a comparative statistic of various diseases in 1900 and 1947: (1) Tuberculosis killed 200 people per 100,000, now 37.2, from the first to the seventh leading cause of death. (2) Pneumonia decreased from 180.5 to 46.1, from the second to the sixth leading cause of death. (3) Dysentery originally had 133.1, now it is 14, possibly retreating from the third to the fifteenth leading cause of death. (4) Heart disease originally ranked fourth, now it ranks first, increasing from 132.1 to 306.6. (5) Nephritis was originally 89, ranking sixth in death, now it is reduced to 58; but it has risen to fifth place. (6) Cerebral hemorrhage used to be ranked eighth, now it is as high as third place, at 90.5. (7) The tenth place is cancer, killing 65 people per thousand people, now it has jumped to second place, killing 130 people. Other deadly infectious diseases are insignificant in the United States. Only physiological diseases are worrying. This year, the American Medical Association reported in March and April that they are implementing a disease insurance system, with 52,000,000 people participating. At the same time, the "Federal Security Organization" has hired 40,000 administrative staff to engage in health, education, and welfare. According to experts, they will add at least 400,000 to 500,000 personnel to handle the national health program, with annual expenses ranging from 10,000,000,000 to 18,000,000,000 US dollars.

It is really sad and shameful that we still have to focus on smallpox, cholera, typhoid fever, meningitis, diphtheria, and dysentery today to think and expend energy. It is still not possible to smoothly carry out vaccinations for the people, and we have to avoid them and make falsehoods. How can such a society be called civilized! In peacetime, the incidence of tuberculosis is more than 300 patients per 100,000 people, and about four people will die every minute. At least 15 million people in the country suffer from tuberculosis. Malaria, which is malaria, is prevalent throughout the year, and patients account for 10% to 50% of the population. Tragedy shrouded the great era. Sexually transmitted diseases are also terribly digging our graves, and almost 10% or more are infected, especially in Shanghai. In addition, trench fever and tetanus during wartime also have an alarming infection rate, and special plans should be made in advance at this time. Summer has arrived, and cleanliness can no longer be tolerated or ignored. Summer plagues are mostly derived from dirt. Poor societies should still be able to achieve cleanliness, right?

### ECA Reports on Achievements in China

[United States Information Service, Washington, 16th] In the last quarter of 1948, although the activities of the US Economic Cooperation Administration in China were limited due to the Chinese Civil War, it was still able to complete a considerable degree of practical work, which benefited the Chinese people greatly.

The ECA enabled the food rationing program in five major coastal cities in China to continue, thereby preventing economic collapse and general chaos. It provided strong support for China's main urban industry—the textile industry—thus guaranteeing the jobs and urgent needs of countless workers. The ECA provided essential oil products and coal to maintain the work of the transportation industry, power plants, and various industries. The ECA facilitated the post-distribution of previously US-supplied medical supplies and insecticides. Finally, the ECA used jointly managed counterpart funds to assist many valuable institutions and programs in China, and was able to plan work despite inflation and civil war.

These facts are revealed in the working report of the last quarter of 1948 published by the ECA, which has been forwarded to the US Congress by President Truman. The report also reviews the military and economic setbacks suffered by the Chinese government during this period, and explains that due to these circumstances, the ECA "was unable to take on the widespread problems of stabilizing finance and revitalizing the economy with limited aid to China funds."

The report notes that larger procurement activities in the fourth quarter focused on various materials such as rice, wheat, flour, petroleum, and cotton, but the procurement of major industrial equipment was temporarily suspended due to the unstable military situation.

The report said that wheat and flour were supplied to Qingdao, Beiping, and Tianjin for rationing, while rice was destined for Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Shantou. Most of the oil was stocked by private oil companies in Shanghai and distributed through the equipment of these companies throughout China. In addition, approximately 225,000 barrels of crude oil per month were shipped from the Persian Gulf to Taiwan for refining and then distributed to mainland China.

Most of the cotton was shipped to Shanghai, and smaller portions were shipped to Tianjin, Qingdao, and Wuxi. The cotton, after being spun, was supplied for export and domestic consumption, and sometimes used to exchange for domestically produced food.

During the quarter, the Rural Reconstruction Joint Committee held its first meeting and drafted various plans to increase the production of scarce agricultural products in the country, established an executive center to carry out land reform and promote public health, rural social education, and local administration, and conducted large-scale adult education.

During this quarter, a general plan was drawn up for the use of counterpart funds. It was agreed at the time that withdrawals from the special account would only be possible when there was an urgent need or a demonstrable contractionary effect. The report pointed out that as of December 30, the total amount of counterpart funds was 157,289,000 US dollars in gold yuan, and the amount already spent was approximately 5,839,000 US dollars, of which the ECA's administrative expenses in China accounted for approximately 1,342,000 US dollars, the expenses of the US Aid Operations Committee were 2,498,000 US dollars, the expenses of special projects were 1,803,000 US dollars, most of which was used for river works. Health care and welfare work accounted for US$53,000 in engineering service fees. The report also stated: "Due to the fact that the plan adopted by the ECA mainly involves equipment, a large amount of counterpart funds is required."

During this quarter, the agency began to discuss with Chinese merchants to allow their products to be exported to the United States for storage. Preliminary consultations were underway at the end of the year. However, the report stated that the transaction problem was further complicated because the completion of the transaction depended on the exchange of commodities and silver dollars, and the depreciated local currency could not be used. The Eightieth Congress has appropriated 275 million yuan as the amount to implement the ECA aid to China program. As of December 31, 195 million yuan has been spent. The subsequent ECA appropriation has brought the total amount of aid to date to 221,918,000 yuan. The Che Hui recently extended the period of the ECA Aid to China Act, extending the original deadline of April 3 this year to February 15, 1950. The unused balance of the original appropriation will be used as the fund for this period.

### UN Maintains Resolution on Diplomatic Restrictions on Franco's Spain; Issue of Italian Colonies Still Awaiting Vote; Current UN General Assembly to Announce End Today or Tomorrow

[Reuters, Lake Success, 17th] The current United Nations General Assembly will close today or tomorrow. One major political issue remains unresolved on the agenda, namely the disposition of the former Italian colonies, which has not yet been decided.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 16th] The United Nations General Assembly tonight upheld its three-year ban on Franco's Spain, but at the same time quashed the Soviet bloc's movement to impose economic sanctions on the Madrid government. The voting on the two cases was as follows:

(1) Regarding the proposal by the Latin American countries to allow United Nations member states to re-appoint ambassadors and ministers to Madrid, the vote was 26 to 15, with 16 abstentions and 2 absences. Because this proposal did not receive a two-thirds majority, it failed to pass. (2) Poland's proposal to ban United Nations member states from transporting munitions to Spain and restricting trade with Spain was rejected by 40 votes to 6, with 7 abstentions. Only the Soviet bloc voted in favor. The United States and the United Kingdom abstained from voting on the first proposal and voted against the second proposal. Before the vote, Polish representative Katz-Suchy denied British representative McNeil's claim that Franco ordered 500 warplanes, propellers, and engines from Poland last year, and said that Poland has no commercial relations with Spain. After the Spanish issue was resolved, the General Assembly adjourned until late at night, when it will discuss the issue of refugees and displaced persons.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 17th] The United Nations General Assembly began debating another Polish proposal this morning, advocating that all countries should accelerate the withdrawal of stateless refugees. Representatives from Poland, Yugoslavia, Ukraine, Belarus, and the Soviet Union accused the Western German occupation authorities of obstructing the withdrawal of refugees who wanted to return to their home countries and allowing international refugee agencies to send these refugees to other countries as "slaves." Therefore, they demanded the adoption of all methods to promote the work of withdrawing refugees and to control refugees sent to other countries. As a result, this proposal was rejected by 31 votes to 6, with 14 abstentions.

### Gromyko Arrives in Paris; Rumor that Cominform is Meeting in Moscow; Eastern European Countries All Send Representatives to Participate

[Reuters, Paris, 16th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko and his eleven Soviet delegation members arrived here this afternoon from New York by plane. Soviet Ambassador to France Bogomolov welcomed them at the airport. After getting off the plane, Gromyko refused to make any statement to reporters, only saying that he would leave here for Moscow tomorrow or the day after.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 16th] Well-informed sources here claimed today that a secret meeting of the Cominform has been convened in Moscow, and representatives from all countries of the "Eastern European Bloc" are attending. The same source said that this is the reason why some leaders of the German Socialist Unity Party are currently not in Berlin. They believe that the convening of this meeting is intended to re-discuss the policies taken by the international communist party since the end of the war before the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference.

### British Foreign Secretary Bevin Scheduled to Go to France on Friday

[Reuters, London, 16th] British Military Governor of Germany Robertson came here from Germany today to have contact with the Foreign Office. He is scheduled to go to Paris on Wednesday to join other British representatives in preparing for the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. A spokesperson for the external office also said that Bevin will leave England for Paris on Friday with Deputy Foreign Secretary Henderson.

### Wallace's Speech: Establishing World Peace, Proposing Six Goals

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 17th] Progressive Party leader Henry Wallace stated in a speech at Madison Square Garden here last night that the hope for peace has stirred the heartstrings of all people. The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris should transform this hope into a concrete agreement. Wallace continued by stating that the goals of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference should be: (1) resolving the German problem, ensuring that Germany's war potential does not re-emerge; (2) reducing armaments, especially all major destructive weapons; (3) stopping the export of arms from one country to another; (4) restoring world trade without any restrictions; (5) allowing people from all over the world to move freely from one country to another; and (6) freely exchanging scientific knowledge between the United States and the Soviet Union.

### A Dictatorial Regime Brewing in Iran

Gendarmerie Still Under Army Command

[Reuters, New York, 16th] The "New York Times" correspondent in Tehran learned from reliable sources that U.S. officials in Tehran were surprised to learn of the Shah's preparation to return command of the gendarmerie to the Ministry of the Army. This is a clear step towards dictatorship, as it would concentrate military power in the hands of soldiers who favor establishing a dictatorial government. It is reported that since 1942, the United States has been assisting Iran in reorganizing its gendarmerie. After strenuous efforts by the U.S. advisory group, the gendarmerie was handed over to the Ministry of the Interior to become a purely police force, no longer directly under the command of the Ministry of the Army. The Iranian army, like the armies of South America, plays a major role in politics. The current plan of the Shah is to first launch a coup, become Minister of the Army, then gradually become Prime Minister, and eventually proclaim himself King. It is recently rumored that the current Chief of Staff, Razmara, advocates establishing a dictatorship in Iran, with the current Shah Reza as King, and Razmara himself as the Shah's right-hand man, allowing him to wield absolute power. If the transfer of the gendarmerie to the command of the Ministry of the Army is confirmed, it will be the greatest threat to the development of democracy in Iran.

### Tripoli Residents Oppose Italian Trusteeship, Demonstrations Widen

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 17th] News reaching Cairo tonight states that the demonstrations which began in Tripoli last week have gained significant momentum. Demonstrators are shouting slogans against Italy and demanding the unification of Libya under the rule of Sayyid Idris al-Senussi, the nominal ruler of Cyrenaica, the neighboring region. It is reported that the political parties in Tripoli have traditionally been divided, with most opposing Sayyid Idris's rule. However, the Bevin-Sforza Plan, which advocates placing Tripoli under Italian trusteeship after 1951, has angered all parties, causing them to set aside their differences. They have sent a telegram to Benghazi requesting Sayyid Idris to declare himself King of Libya. The flags of Sayyid Idris have been raised on mosques in Tripoli today. It is reported that Libya includes Tripoli and Cyrenaica.

[Agence France-Presse, Benghazi, 17th] The wave of demonstrations against the Bevin-Sforza Plan and demanding complete independence in Tripoli has now spread to Cyrenaica. Today, demonstrators attacked British police and tore down the British flag. Several buildings have been decorated with the flags of Sayyid Idris, which were carried by demonstrators chanting through the streets. The authorities have implemented special security measures to prevent the situation from escalating.

### New Polish Government-in-Exile Established in London

[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th] Polish exiles here announced tonight the formation of a new government-in-exile to replace the previous government-in-exile, which dissolved five weeks ago. The members of the new government, appointed by the President of the government-in-exile, Zaleski, are as follows: Prime Minister Tomasz Arciszewski, Interior Minister Ostrowski, Foreign Minister Szokalski, and Minister of Immigration Link. It is reported that the dissolution of the previous government-in-exile was prompted by the resignation of former Prime Minister General Bor-Komorowski.

### US Republican Senator Advocates Military Aid to China

[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] Republican Senator Knowland revealed today that a group of Republican senators will attempt to promote a $200 million military aid plan for China. It is claimed that "this matter will be raised in the Senate during the discussion of the government's $1.45 billion overall military aid plan. I believe we can obtain enough votes to include the military aid plan for China in the overall foreign aid plan." It is reported that the government is requesting $1.13 billion to assist countries in the Atlantic Treaty organization to rearm, and another $320 million to assist Greece and Turkey. However, due to the upcoming Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris, government leaders are not accelerating the promotion of this plan. Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Democratic leader Lucas, agree that there is no urgent need for swift action at this time. Furthermore, the Foreign Relations Committee's discussion of the North Atlantic Treaty is nearing its end and is expected to conclude and be approved on the 18th.

### South Korea Feels Threatened by Aggression, Calls for U.S. Military Aid, Hopes to Conclude Pacific Pact

[United Press, Washington, 16th] Dr. Chough Pyong-ok, the special representative of South Korean President Syngman Rhee, told the press today that South Korea is likely to be subjected to Soviet aggression "at any time" and requested the United States to provide a military guarantee to support South Korea's territorial integrity. Dr. Chough confirmed that the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists have formed a "de facto alliance" with the North Korean Communist government, and stated that South Korea hopes to obtain a definite guarantee of military support from the United States in the event of foreign aggression or domestic aggression controlled by foreign powers.

Dr. Chough stated that South Korea needs military equipment to supply a standing army of 100,000 men and a police force and reserve army of 100,000 men. Up to now, "the United States has only supplied equipment for approximately 38,000 people in Korea. Obviously, we need more military aid."

[Associated Press, Seoul, 16th] South Korean President Syngman Rhee issued a statement today, reiterating his appeal to the United States, stating that he proposes one of the following three measures to address the serious threat posed by communist aggression to South Korea and Asia: (1) concluding a Pacific Treaty, similar to the Atlantic Treaty; (2) forming a separate agreement between the United States and South Korea, implementing joint defense against any country; (3) issuing a public declaration guaranteeing the defense, unification, democracy, and independence of Korea, consistent with President Truman's anti-communist policy.

[United Press, Ottawa, 16th] Canadian Foreign Ministry officials have not yet commented on the report from Canberra that "a Pacific Security Pact plan is in progress."

[United Press, Tokyo, 17th] An editorial in the English-language "Japan Times" on the 17th called for the establishment of a non-communist Pacific alliance to form an all-Asian economic resistance front to cope with the rapidly developing communism in its new base in China.

### Indian Constituent Assembly Approves Declaration of Republic within Commonwealth, US Lifts Arms Embargo to India

[Reuters, New Delhi, 17th] The Indian Constituent Assembly today, by an overwhelming majority, resolved that India will continue to participate in the British Commonwealth. Prime Minister Nehru told the Constituent Assembly that India's continued connection with the Commonwealth would enable India to obtain economic assistance and would also help maintain domestic order. He also stated that the declaration of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in London did not bind India, and that India could leave the Commonwealth at any time by a resolution of the Constituent Assembly.

[Agence France-Presse, Karachi, 16th] Authoritative sources here stated that the United States has lifted the order to suspend the shipment of arms to India and Pakistan. It is reported that this ban was implemented after the partition of India and Pakistan and was suspended in February. The source also said that Pakistan has ordered some arms from the United States.

### Eisler Arrested in UK, US Requests Extradition

Britain Rejects Polish Protest

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 16th] A U.S. State Department spokesman today confirmed that the Department of Justice has requested the British government to extradite Gerhart Eisler, a U.S. communist who fled to Britain and was arrested. The request was telegraphed to the U.S. Ambassador in London on the 13th of this month for transmission to the British government.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th] Polish Ambassador to Britain, Michalowski, lodged a verbal protest today regarding the arrest of German communist Gerhart Eisler by British police on a Polish mail ship. He stated that the British authorities boarded the ship and arrested Eisler without the permission of the Polish consul or the ship's owner, which was a violation of international law. A British Foreign Office spokesman stated tonight that the arrest of Eisler did not violate international law.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th] British Home Secretary Ede declared in the House of Commons today that Eisler is guilty of forging documents and should be extradited under the Anglo-American extradition treaty. Eisler had violated his bail terms and fled in secret. The U.S. Embassy had requested the Southampton magistrate to issue a warrant for his arrest. Subsequently, police officers boarded the Polish ship Batory and informed the captain that the arrest would be delayed if the captain agreed to keep the ship in place until the afternoon to allow further consideration of the matter. When the captain refused, the police officers immediately carried out the arrest. At this point, Communist Party Member Gallacher stood up and shouted loudly, and the Speaker ordered him to maintain order. Ede then answered questions from left-wing Members of Parliament Zilliacus and Mills, stating that the case is currently being heard by a local official, who will determine the legal points of the U.S. government's extradition request. If the Polish government applied for the arrest of a person on an American ship, it would be handled in the same manner. Gallacher then attempted to launch a full debate on the case, but the Speaker refused, stating that the most important point of this case is that it should be heard by the court, and the House of Commons cannot interfere.

### Chinese Communist Party Representatives Attending the Paris Peace Conference Discuss the CCP's Policy Line: Adhering to the Soviet Union, No Tito Allowed

[Reuters, Prague, 17th] Chinese Communist Party leaders want the CCP to implement orthodox communist policies. They are well aware that Western countries hope the CCP can become the Tito of the East, so they are doing their best to prevent the CCP from developing such a trend. This is at least the opinion of the CCP delegation attending the Paris World Peace Congress. The delegation is under strict security police protection here, and it is virtually impossible for Western reporters to meet with them. Several Western reporters attempted to meet with the Chinese representatives, but they were stopped by accompanying detectives after only a few words.

However, judging from the statements made by Qian Zongrui (transliteration), one of the representatives, to Czech communist reporters, and the information obtained from other sources, it appears that the CCP also intends to implement the policies determined by the Cominform for the people's democracies. Diplomatic observers believe that the Chinese delegation attending the Peace Congress is an authoritative delegation that fully represents the CCP, so their statements regarding the CCP's policy decisions are indeed worthy of attention. Qian Zongrui, an economics professor at Peking University, solemnly declared to Czech reporters, "There is no, will not be, and cannot be any Tito in China. The victory of the Chinese people is the result of an international policy." Those familiar with communist jargon immediately understand that Qian's intention is to deny any trend of the CCP turning into national communists. Qian also emphasized that "the Chinese people have been greatly encouraged by the Soviet Union and the rights of the people's democracies." Observers point out that this is an acknowledgment of the Soviet Union and the Red Army having strength beyond that of other countries, which is precisely what Marshal Tito despises. Qian also said, "Politically, the CCP will learn lessons from the Soviet experience." This statement is also entirely in line with the attitude of orthodox communists in Europe. Qian also said, "The new China will be a people's democracy leaning towards socialism," which is the same attitude as the Czech Communist Party. For the past year, the Czech Communist Party has consistently used the same formula to describe its own position. What the Czech Communist Party advocates is that under the leadership of the Communist Party, and based on the speeches of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin, and the lessons learned from the Moscow Communist Party experience, the first step is to overthrow the opposing forces, and then establish a dictatorship and organize the people's democracy. According to the theory, people's democracy is only the first stage of promoting communism, and socialism is its second stage. Currently, only the Soviet Union has reached the second stage, and communism is the third and final stage. Under this stage, the state theoretically tends to disappear, the development of a classless society is completed, and the goal of universal human equality is achieved. In the case of China, it is currently in the earliest stage, because its "people's democratic" government is still being formed. One of the initial tasks of any people's democratic government is to industrialize the country. Lenin and Stalin both believed that the proletariat in the industrial sector is the most trustworthy, and although farmers can also participate, land ownership is ultimately a major risk factor that can increase or decrease capitalism. Therefore, the Cominform's circular last year attached great importance to this point. In its condemnation of Tito, it pointed out that he had made various mistakes in handling rural issues. In the case of the CCP, it seems to have learned a lot from this. Qian stated, "The CCP's first priority is to transform the agricultural country of China into an industrial country. In this regard, we should learn a lot from the lessons the Soviet Union has obtained in the past." According to reports, the Soviet Union's first step was to nationalize all land, and then deal with this land, resulting in a great famine and mass exodus. Today, the people's democracies, with the Soviet Union as a cautionary tale, are gradually reforming the countryside, and will nationalize the land when the time is ripe.

### US Ambassador to the Philippines Takes Office

[United Press, San Francisco, 17th] The new U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines, Cowen, left here by plane on the 17th, flying to Honolulu before proceeding to the Philippines to take office.

### Japanese House of Representatives Passes Bill to Expand Police Force

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] The Japanese House of Representatives passed a bill to expand the police force tonight, "due to recent changes in the international situation, the police need to ensure social stability and improve people's lives." The main points of the bill are to improve the police organization, readjust the relationship between the national rural police and the local government police, and improve police benefits, but it does not mention expanding police weapons and equipment.

### Emperor Hirohito Tours Southern Japan, Lasting Approximately Four Weeks

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 17th] Emperor Hirohito left here at nine o'clock this morning with twenty attendants on a special train to Kyushu, for a twenty-seven-day tour. He will inspect the island's cultural industries and social conditions, and visit various cities, including Nagoya, which was bombed by the atomic bomb. Observers here say that since the establishment of Japan's new constitution, Hirohito has often traveled outside and contacted the people in an attempt to restore his reputation. However, since December 1947, he had temporarily suspended activities while awaiting the verdicts of war criminals such as Tojo. Now that this matter has passed, he is free to travel again. It is reported that Kyushu was the center of activity for extreme Japanese patriots before the war, and it is now a concentration point for both far-right and far-left elements. Japanese newspapers say that when Hirohito travels, he will personally pay the travel expenses for himself and his attendants, reversing the previous practice of having local governments bear the expenses.

### Preliminary Results of East German Elections for Parliament Announced Yesterday: More Votes Against Than For, Unexpected

[Associated Press, Berlin, 17th] The East German elections for the People's Chamber have ended today, and the preliminary results have greatly disappointed the Communist Party. According to the East Berlin Election General Committee, in the initial count of 7,000 votes, 2,820 voted in favor of the "People's Chamber," while as many as 3,809 voted against it, with approximately 250 invalid votes.

Some ballots were inscribed with the words "We do not approve of the police state, we oppose communism." The Election Committee has been ordered to temporarily stop counting votes pending review. The final results of the election will be announced by the People's Committee controlled by the Communist Party. At the same time, the Soviet military newspaper accused the German separatist Catholic Democratic Party and the Free Democratic Party of being duplicitous, pretending to be loyal to the People's Congress, while secretly instigating the people to oppose it, and that the voters who cast negative votes must have been tricked by them.

[United Press, Berlin, 17th] Communist officials completed the counting of votes for the "People's Congress" this morning, but refused to announce any results, which seems to confirm reports that the election results show that more voters opposed than supported the list of candidates put forward by the Communist Party. Newspapers in West Berlin reported that more than half of the voters rejected the candidates designated by the Communist Party. Officials subsequently announced that the election results will be released on the 18th.

### French Troops to Launch Major Offensive in Northern Vietnam

[Reuters, Saigon, 16th] Well-informed sources say that the French army may take action on the Vietnamese-Chinese border to deal with the Viet Minh army. This decision may be made after French Army Chief of Staff General Revers arrives in Saigon from France. In this new plan, the pacification work in southern Vietnam will be undertaken by the Vietnamese army. Nguyen Van Quang, of the Viet Minh Central Provisional Government, will soon meet with Bao Dai to discuss the possibility of large-scale use of the Vietnamese army in the south to deal with guerrillas.

### Industrial Production in Western European Recipient Countries Gradually Recovering to Pre-War Levels: US Economic Cooperation Administration Releases Performance Report

[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] President Truman submitted to Congress today the 1948 annual winter report of the Economic Cooperation Administration, stating that the economic situation of the countries in Europe receiving aid under the Marshall Plan has made satisfactory progress, and it is expected that the dollar shortage situation in these countries can be improved by 30% by June or July of this year. Truman also warned that if European countries wish to be independent and self-sufficient by the end of the Marshall Plan in 1952, they must complete large-scale economic development and reforms. Truman stated that the joint efforts of European countries receiving US aid to restore economic health have completed the first phase, and have generally reached pre-war production levels. However, this is not enough, and these countries must try their best to exceed pre-war levels before they can succeed. Judging from the work plan of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation for July 1948 to June 1949, its performance at the end of December last year can be considered satisfactory. There is confidence that the production and trade targets for the 1948-1949 fiscal year have been achieved. The shortage of gold and US dollars under the capital and current accounts is 5.5 billion yuan, compared to 7.8 billion yuan in the previous fiscal year, a decrease of 30%. Only a few countries are lagging slightly behind in the pace of recovery. However, the second phase has just begun, with the goal of achieving the highest level of production necessary for economic independence. Before the end of this phase, Western European production must exceed pre-war levels. The President's report also stated that in 1947, Western European countries could only afford less than 40% of imports with their financial resources, and it is now expected that they can afford half. If they want to balance exports and imports, they must step up their efforts, especially focusing on innovating industries, improving exports to adapt to the market, developing overseas territories, reducing trade barriers, and attracting tourists with European landmarks. The fundamental reforms of the Western European economy can only be done gradually, and US aid is an essential part of its recovery.

### Mayor Issues Message to Citizens: Food and Coal Supplies Assured; Should Help the Military Defend Greater Shanghai

[Reported by this newspaper] Mayor Chen received reporters at the City Hall conference room yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM and issued a written statement, "Message to the Citizens of Shanghai," as follows: "I, Liang, having been entrusted with this mission at a time when Shanghai is facing war, feel deeply apprehensive and terrified. However, mindful of Shanghai as the nation's economic center, built up over a century with achievements not easily attained, I bear the inescapable responsibility to preserve and maintain it. Therefore, with a sense of profound unease and burdened by overwhelming pressure, I respectfully present my sincere thoughts to all fellow citizens of the city, earnestly seeking your cooperation so that we may navigate these turbulent waters together. First, livelihood is paramount, food is first: Shanghai has a population of six million, and maintaining their daily lives is already quite difficult, let alone in wartime. Therefore, the first task of the municipal government today is how to maintain the lives of citizens and prevent them from feeling the heavy pressure of war too much. In this regard, I dare to solemnly announce to all fellow citizens of the city that the municipal government, in conjunction with relevant agencies, has planned for a certain amount of food and coal supplies, which will definitely not be lacking. The supply of affordable rations to poor citizens should be increased to maintain their minimum needs. Second, public order is paramount, stability is first: Although Shanghai is facing war, the military forces defending Shanghai will certainly strike the attackers, and Shanghai will still be Shanghai of the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, I especially request all fellow citizens in the city to remain steadfast in their professional positions during this battle to defend Greater Shanghai, and actively participate in various self-defense organizations to enhance the city's public security forces, curb the activities of spies, and quell the instigation of riots by thugs, in order to ensure the stability of Shanghai and prevent it from being affected by the war. Third, support the war effort, unite the military and civilians: The national army operating around Shanghai is strong, loyal, and brave, and will certainly win on the battlefield. Under the premise that everything is for Shanghai and everything is for the war, the citizens of Shanghai must do everything possible to help the army and be willing to defend Greater Shanghai for the people. Fourth, maintain production, labor and capital cooperate: Shanghai is an industrial city, and with the start of victory, there were signs of recovery, but due to frequent wars everywhere and the shrinking domestic market, the situation has become increasingly depressed. Now that we are facing war, closing down is not an option, and maintaining production is impossible. It is not difficult to imagine the plight of industrialists and businessmen. At this time, capitalists should consider the livelihoods of workers, and workers should also understand the difficulties of capitalists, helping each other through difficulties and sharing hardships together. As for the municipal government, it will do everything possible to coordinate and assist in order to overcome the current difficulties and preserve the foundation for future recovery. Fifth, reform politics, eliminate corruption: Reforming politics depends on diligent action. Eliminating corruption, weeding out incompetence, saving financial and material resources, and improving administrative efficiency are my firm resolutions. However, from top to bottom, it is difficult to adapt to reality. I sincerely hope that my colleagues in the municipal government and all fellow citizens will report to the municipal government what they see, and I will sincerely accept it. If there are those in the municipal government who are corrupt, pervert the law, commit crimes, or violate the law, I hope that you will report them at any time in order to revitalize the decline and establish righteousness. Sixth, stabilize the economy, eliminate speculation: Shanghai is known as a paradise for adventurers, coming and going in droves. The bustling Bund is almost entirely shrouded in an atmosphere of speculation. In normal times, this is enough to disrupt the market and stir up people's hearts, making it impossible for economic life to seek normalcy. In wartime, it only adds fuel to the fire and provides opportunities for the enemy. Therefore, my response to Shanghai's economy today is to seek stability through control. All commercial speculation will be eliminated with the greatest effort, so that industrialists and businessmen can obtain reasonable survival in a normal market environment. Seventh, one world, cooperation between China and foreign countries: Shanghai is an international city, and citizens, regardless of their nationality, share a common destiny. Although we are facing war today, the municipal government will, in accordance with international conventions, provide strict protection for the lives and property of foreigners. However, it is also hoped that foreign communities will, in the spirit of one world, cooperate sincerely to overcome the current crisis. Eighth, expert politics, build Shanghai: Shanghai is eternal. Although we are facing war today, we will never put Shanghai's construction projects behind us because of the war. The blueprint for the construction of Shanghai is new and concrete in our minds. War and construction can complement each other. Therefore, for the current municipal facilities, while dealing with the war situation and maintaining the status quo, the fundamental plan is still how to draw the blueprint for the construction of Shanghai. Appoint experts, work together, and given time, I believe that Shanghai will surely become a paradise for the people. The above are all humble opinions, but governance lies not in many words, but in how to strive for action. I am a servant of the six million people of Shanghai, but politics is ultimately the matter of the people. Therefore, what the six million fellow citizens of Shanghai should strive for today is how to supervise and promote the municipal government to be pragmatic, from the bottom up, unite sincerely, so that the new force of democratic progress can grow rapidly, and with firm and unwavering action, jointly and steadily overcome the current war situation. We have faith, and we will question the future."

### Students Remaining in Shanghai: Rations to be Supplied as Usual; Schools to Collect Vouchers for Distribution

### Silver Money Industry Preparatory Committee Has Not Resumed Operations

It is rumored that the committee has resumed operations and is jointly handling the payment and withdrawal of exchange accounts for banks with the city's Check Clearing House, as the Central Bank has transferred the business to the latter. However, according to a person in charge of the committee who remained behind, the committee has not resumed operations at this time. He stated that the Preparatory Committee seems to have no need to resume operations for the time being until the Central Bank resumes operations.

Furthermore, the Central Bank of China's payment of overnight deposit balances for various banks and firms yesterday remained at 70% in cash and 30% in banker's drafts, entrusted to the clearing house for payment.

After the Central Bank complied with the order from the Garrison Headquarters Political Committee to temporarily suspend the listing of remittances, remittances from overseas Chinese will still be converted at the market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates, making it unnecessary to list them. These certificates can be freely bought and sold in Shanghai and Guangzhou in South China, so there should be no inconvenience. It is estimated that around two million US dollars worth of foreign exchange certificates are currently circulating in the Shanghai market.

The market for foreign exchange transfer certificates saw a sudden rebound yesterday, due to the low US dollar exchange rate. It opened at 1.6 million, with transactions as low as 1.5 million. It then rallied due to rising gold and currency prices, reaching over 2 million, and finally settling at 2.12 million, up 600,000 from the previous day.

### Silver Dollar Black Market Soars

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday's silver dollar market was in a state of stalemate due to the Central Bank's failure to list rates. Businesses continued to suspend trading. Street-level silver dollar dealers became more active, and the black market price surged sharply. By the afternoon, the price was said to have reached par.

[Our Dispatch] The listed prices for gold ornaments exchanged for silver dollars remained at 48 and 53. Factory bars were priced an additional two dollars, at 50 and 55 dollars.

Yesterday, currency market sentiment suddenly turned favorable, with a shift in public confidence. Various parties actively snapped up currency, increasing activity. Twenty-cent coins traded at 200,000 and 250,000 in the morning, rising to 250,000 and 300,000 in the afternoon. Ten-cent coins also rose from 100,000 and 150,000 to 120,000 and 170,000, while five-cent coins rose to 60,000 and 90,000, about double the previous day's price.

[Our Dispatch] The exchange rate between gold and silver varied, narrowing by one dollar. The initial exchange rate was 47 and 50, then fell slightly to 46 and 49. One type of currency traded at 45 and 48, another at 47 and 50, and foreign silver coins at 50 and 55.

The exchange rate between gold and silk yarn remained stable, at 52 and 54 dollars.

The exchange rate between silk yarn and silver varied significantly. One type of silk yarn traded at 8.8 and 9.3 dollars, another at 9.3 and 9.8 dollars, and matched sets at 9 and 9.5 dollars. Foreign silver coins were trading at a premium, at 9.5 and 10.05 dollars.

### Gold Prices Rise Steadily, National Bank Sells Extensively to Suppress Prices to 5 Billion

[Our Dispatch] The gold market yesterday saw extremely enthusiastic sentiment due to positive external factors, with abundant funds and a lack of supply. Trading became increasingly chaotic. The official listed price reached the daily limit of 4.608 billion, with plenty of bids but no offers. The outside market saw even greater gains, opening at 4.2 billion and 4.4 billion and rising steadily, breaking through the 5 billion mark, reaching as high as 5.3 billion and 5.5 billion. The Central Bank then entrusted Dadecheng Gold Shop to sell gold at prices of 5.4 billion and 5.3 billion, but there were no takers due to the high price. The market closed slightly lower at 5.2 billion and 5.4 billion in the afternoon. In the afternoon, the market stabilized as the Central Bank suppressed prices to 5 billion, entrusting Dadecheng with unlimited sales. The gold shop had strong buying interest and sold a total of 149 large bars, ultimately closing at 5.1 billion and 5.3 billion, a significant increase of 1.1 billion from the previous day.

The outside market for US dollars followed suit, with demand exceeding supply. It opened at 8.3 million and 8.8 million, quickly surpassing the 10 million mark, reaching as high as 10.2 million and 10.7 million, before closing at 10 million and 10.5 million in the afternoon. The afternoon gains slowed, ultimately closing at 9.7 million and 10.2 million, still up 2.4 million.

Yesterday, gold ornaments in jewelry stores rose sharply due to frequent increases in gold prices, reaching 460 million and 540 million, up 80 million from the previous day. Silver ornaments, however, remained stable at 4 million and 5 million. The labor cost for melting old gold to make new gold remained at 16 million per ounce. There were no price changes in the afternoon.

### No Goods Arriving on the Market, Rice Prices Continue to Rise

[Our Dispatch] Rice prices continued to rise, tracking the increase in gold and silver prices outside the exchange. At the South Market, white japonica and thin paddy rice both approached the 60 million mark, opening at 59.5 million, while early rice opened at 58 million, each up 6-7 million. White japonica and thin paddy rice each opened at 58 million at the North Market. White yuan rice sales were slow, opening at only 53 million, with no new arrivals registered on the market.

Miscellaneous Grains

Prices also rose due to the increase in gold and silver prices, but with more selling than buying, the market remained weak. Jiujiang winter beans were at 32 million, up over 10 million from yesterday. Corn rose by over 3 million. Transactions in mung beans were limited. Pudong mud mung beans were at 37 million, while peanuts and sesame seeds rose uniformly.

Flour

Languishing in a weak state. Although prices outside the exchange rose, public sentiment was low, with many sellers. The opening saw some weakness, but the market recovered slightly later, ultimately settling at the previous day's level. Old Che flour opened at 10.4 million and closed at 12 million. Warship flour closed at 10 million. Red Bee flour was weak, while Jiancheng was stable. Wheat bran opened at 8 million.

Cooking Oil

Followed the rise in gold and silver, opening strong but declining slightly later due to excessive selling. Soybean oil opened at 200 million at the factory, later seeing a rebound to 180 million, up 5 million from the previous day. Rapeseed oil closed at 150 million, also up 5 million. Raw oil approached the 200 million mark. Soybean cake did not open.

### Yarn and Cloth All Strong

Yesterday, cotton yarn saw strong market conditions due to strong buying interest from various merchants, with firm public sentiment and continued gains in financial products outside the exchange. 42-count Blue Phoenix traded at 172.5 million, up 37.5 million from the previous day. 40-count and 32-count each rose by 250 million to 280 million, while 21-count Double Horse spot goods were at 107.5 million, up around 200 million. 20-count and below each rose by 150 million to 250 million.

Cotton cloth saw a steady upward trend. The Ningbo merchants continued to actively buy, and the black market price of silver dollars steadily rose, so the market price in gold yuan notes saw an obvious rise. Dragon Head fine cloth and low-end fine cloth were particularly strong due to strong customer sales. Four Gentlemen yuan serge, however, saw narrower demand due to seasonal factors, and fell slightly compared to the previous day. Dragon Head fine cloth and Four Gentlemen yuan serge both opened at 17.6 million, then rose together to a high of 18.4 million due to numerous buyers, before profitable sales near closing. Dragon Head fine cloth closed at 18 million, the same as the previous day's price, while Four Gentlemen serge retreated to 17 million at one point before closing at 17.4 million, down 600,000. Five Blessings fine cloth rose to 16 million, while Dragon Head B fine cloth rose from 16 million to 16.4 million, up 800,000. Three Peaches fine cloth jumped by 1.2 million, ultimately closing at 15.6 million. Private factory prices rose sharply, with high-end shirting opening at 80 million.

### Tea Market Rebounds and Rises

The tea market remained sluggish due to weak actual sales and hesitant buying interest, with no significant transactions. After a long period of stagnation, the market rebounded sharply yesterday, with prices uniformly breaking through their original positions and moving forward. The reason for this was that the strong performance of gold had not waned, constantly boosting public sentiment. Sellers raised prices to extremes, ultimately resulting in gains of 60-70 million per dan (unit of weight), with fairly firm footing.

### Tung Oil Continues to Rise

The tung oil market continued to rise yesterday, with prices reaching unprecedented highs. This was due to the continuous rise in prices of goods outside the industry, especially the rapid surge in gold prices, which further boosted public sentiment. Sellers continued to raise prices, ultimately leading to excitement, but weak buying interest made it difficult for transactions to turn around.

### Plum Rains Season Approaching, Weather Unstable

[Our Dispatch] Since the beginning of this month, from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River to South China, the coastal weather has been unstable due to the continuous exchange between the mainland climate and the Pacific air currents. Shanghai has also experienced alternating sunshine and rain. According to the Meteorological Observatory, this type of weather is extremely beneficial to crops. Since the Pacific air currents have not been stable, it is expected that this intermittent climate will be difficult to end for a while, and this year's plum rains season may also arrive early.

### Wugang and Chengbu Shrouded in Dark Shadows

[Changsha News] "The people of Chengbu are in a state of panic, Wugang is startled several times a night." According to a casual conversation with a person who recently came to Changsha from Chengbu, this sentence summarizes the recent situation in Chengbu and Wugang. Chengbu and Wugang are on the edge of southwestern Hunan. When the overall situation changed, wildfires first broke out on the southwestern edge of Hunan. These wildfires are still burning, and now Yin Liyan (a graduate of the Army Academy who once served as the president of the Nanjing Huaxia Daily) and others want to spread these wildfires to the southwest. - Ambitious figures in the border areas are active, but the people are groaning.

Yin Liyan now calls himself "Commander-in-Chief of Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Guizhou and Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government." He wears such a large hat, which is a bluff, but it is a bit touching, especially for the general rural ignorant and general anti-faction members, it is not without a little temptation. In Chengbu, near the Sui Ning border, it is said that some people have been contacted. Recently, bandit activity was discovered near Xiyan City (80 miles from Chengbu County and 40 miles from Wugang County). The Xiyan police station sends police everywhere to search and suppress them during the day, but there is no trace. At night, in order to avoid being "touched", they have to drag people and guns to other places to camp. When people are sent to persuade them, they say: "We are all locals, how can we be exploited by Yin Liyan!"

"Mo Xinchun in Wugang has about 800 people and guns, occupying the triangular area of Tangdukoutangtian City and Baicang. Liu Qiong occupies Dengjiapu in the northwest township, and Liu Zhenguo occupies Shanmen. These roles are directly or indirectly related to Yin Liyan. The Wugang police force also clashed with them twice. As a result, Zhang Zhenqing's police team defeated Liu Zhenguo and confiscated several of his guns, but Xie Guangming's police team was eaten up by Liu Qiong and more than 60 guns were taken away. Their leaflets, slogans and notices were once posted in Wugang County, meaning: We will enter the city soon, and we hope the people will not disturb each other.

It is said that Mo Xinchun and Liu Qiong want to develop towards Chengbu and plan to cross the Xin (Ning) Wu (Gang) border via Huangqiaopu and attack Weixi Township in Chengbu to seize the self-defense weapons in Xiyan City: Yin Liyan also ordered a certain Yuan, the "garrison battalion commander" stationed in Huangtutang, to surround Chengbu County via Haikou, Suining. They believe that Chengbu is a place that can be attacked and defended, and the food is quite abundant, and the self-defense weapons make them even more coveted, which is why they have the ambition to get involved. Another saying is that there are local Communists active in Chengbu. The Sixth District Commissioner's Office saw the crisis in Chengbu and specially sent an inspector to deploy defenses. After several meetings, the only result was to transfer the self-defense team originally stationed in the county to Xiyan to defend against Mo Xinchun's intrusion.

Currently, there are still bandits or scattered bandits in Chengbu who are harassing the people, and neighboring counties Suining and Wugang are frequently reporting emergencies. There are more rumors about Suining, and some say that certain self-defense forces in the county have been shaken. Although this is not necessarily all true, it has a great impact on people's hearts. Inside Chengbu, however, there is still open and secret strife, causing chaos.

In addition to this future concern, there is also the legend of corruption. In the streets and alleys, after drinking and over tea, the legend of corruption has become a common topic of conversation. It is said that if you want to be a township head, you have to buy the position with money. The township head near the town temple costs 300 silver dollars, and the remote township also costs one or two hundred. Now Chengbu can't see newspapers and foreign mail, and the common people seem to be stuffed in a dark cave, not knowing what the outside world has become; everyone is guessing: in a month or two, there will probably be a terrible situation coming."

### The Stalemate in Western Yunnan

— Zheng Chuan

[Kunming Dispatch] Not long ago, the communist bandits in southern Yunnan captured Shiping and besieged Mengzi, their fierce advance cutting off traffic on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. At the same time, communist bandits in eastern Yunnan occupied Lunan and attacked Yiliang, directly threatening the gates of Kunming, causing panic and unrest among the populace.

Under these circumstances, the authorities had no choice but to concentrate their efforts, and the main force of the 26th Army was deployed to southern Yunnan. The Pacification and Security Regiment, originally stationed in western Yunnan, was also successively transferred back to Kunming, finally alleviating the crisis in southern Yunnan.

The communist bandit troops are all from rural backgrounds, unworldly, and only took to the path of rebellion to make a living. These untrained and unorganized peasants cannot withstand a single blow from the Central Army. For example, Wan Baobang's unit, once enjoying great prestige, suffered repeated defeats, retreating hundreds of miles to the Yunnan-Vietnam border.

However, to avoid the main force and engage in a "hide-and-seek" tactic with the Central Army, the communist bandits, after the situation in southern Yunnan calmed down, caused trouble again in western Yunnan. Not long after the Security Regiment withdrew to Kunming, Menghua County responded with an uprising led by a local landlord and tyrant, Li Shuo-sheng. What is strange is that the authorities were completely unaware beforehand, and were even about to appoint him as the magistrate of Huhua County. The day after receiving the news, Li Shuo-sheng led his private troops and suddenly stormed into the county seat, implementing an armed takeover of the county government. The incumbent magistrate, He Shao-cheng, a former provincial senator and newspaper publisher, never dreamed that disaster would fall from the sky and was "captured alive" by Li Shuo-sheng. It turns out that there had been a rift between He and Li for some time, because He had been ordered to eradicate opium, destroying Li's opium seedlings—his wealth. Li now wants revenge, to settle the opium account, demanding compensation from He Shao-cheng for the losses, pricing each opium seedling at two jiao (half a silver dollar). Li even wanted to kill He, but fortunately some local elders intervened, and He was spared from death, but it is rumored that He's wife was subjected to torture—her hair was burned off.

After occupying Menghua, Li Shuo-sheng even raised the banner of the "Democratic Allied Army," openly antagonizing Lu Han. This terrible wildfire is spreading, and the surrounding counties, already in turmoil, are "learning" from Li Shuo-sheng. Midu, Jingdong, Yun County, Changning, and Mianning—have successively rebelled.

Next, Baoshan, an important town in western Yunnan and a major station on the Burma Road, also saw a rebellion led by the former county magistrate, Yang Heng-zhou, and the dismissed commander of the regiment management area, Zhang Zhen-ying. Kunming had already received intelligence that Baoshan was about to "rebel." On April 11, telecommunications between Kunming and Baoshan were cut off.

The following day, the fall of Baoshan was confirmed, and the rebellion's armed forces stormed the city walls late at night, setting fire to the county government. The county magistrate's whereabouts are unknown. The county bank was looted, and the manager and many other elders were shot. A major fire engulfed the entire city, and order collapsed. Criminals took the opportunity to rob, and the innocent civilians suffered a great disaster.

The fall of Baoshan, when the bad news arrived, shook not only the entire western Yunnan but also Kunming, because Baoshan is one of the four major counties in the province, with a large county seat, developed commerce, and is a thoroughfare on the Yunnan-Burma Road.

After occupying Baoshan, Yang Heng-zhou continued to expand outwards. Tengchong County in the west bore the brunt and the situation became critical, urgently sending a telegram to the provincial government for help. Yongping County, northeast of Baoshan, also fell into turmoil on the 13th. Yongping is a small, impoverished town, and the rebellious armed forces attacked it to use it as a passage. Advancing east to Xiaguan—a commercial area that boomed during the War of Resistance, with plenty of money and supplies—naturally became a target of covetousness. Yang's troops also occupied two major and strategic projects on the Yunnan-Burma Road—Gongguo Bridge and Huitong Bridge—with the aim of using the natural defenses of these two places to attack or defend as needed.

Half of the map of western Yunnan has disintegrated, and the Yunnan-Burma Road has been cut off section by section. The provincial government authorities have organized a Western Yunnan Suppression Headquarters, set up in Dali Prefecture. A large joint defense is being implemented in the eight counties of Dali. The military headquarters is located in Dali, and is presided over by Zhou Shu-xun, the commander of the Western Yunnan Garrison Area.

As of now, the situation in western Yunnan seems to be in a stalemate. The rebellious armed forces are eyeing Xiaguan and Dali with intense hostility, but dare not attack fortified positions. On the official side, the reinforced Security Regiments have arrived, but have yet to launch a counteroffensive to recover the lost territories, and the rebellions in the various counties remain as before.

Beacon fires are everywhere, and smoke signals rise everywhere. Western Yunnan has been ruined!

### Mayor of Hsinchu, Taiwan, Battles with Police Officers

— Gu Liang

When Chairman Chen convened a provincial administrative meeting in Taipei on March 1, a small but significant ripple was stirred in the usually calm political waters of Hsinchu. It is said that this matter even reached the Garrison Headquarters! The reason is as follows:

More than ninety pages have been torn off the calendar, and the public employees of Hsinchu City are watching as prices rise day by day. News from Taipei reported that salaries for January were advanced at the end of January, and salaries for February were advanced at the beginning of February. In mid-February, salaries for March were advanced. Then came a series of good news about adjusting salaries starting in February. However, Hsinchu, only two and a half hours away from Taipei by train, only advanced 30,000 yuan per employee and 20,000 yuan per laborer during the Lunar New Year. Until March, there was no news of salaries for January being paid. They have been forced to a point where they can no longer survive, and their inner depression finally erupted. First, the staff of the police bureau initiated a report to Chairman Chen, recounting the difficult living conditions and requesting the provincial government authorities to resolve the matter reasonably. This report was personally delivered to Taipei by representative Mr. X, who was elected on March 3. Mr. X first went to the provincial government conference hall, but because the security was tight, the report could not be delivered directly to Chairman Chen. So he went to the chairman's residence and waited at the gate. But after waiting for a long time, he still had not succeeded. He managed to ask a friend to place the report on the chairman's desk.

When it was Mayor Chen Zhen-bin of Hsinchu's turn to report at the administrative meeting, it is said that Chairman Chen asked Mayor Chen, "Hsinchu City's land tax collection has reached over 90%, and other tax revenues are presumably also good. Why can't the salaries of public employees be paid?" The mayor blushed and could not answer. After the meeting, a section chief from the Department of Finance told Mayor Chen that Chairman Chen's words were based on the report from your Hsinchu City civil servants. (Because that report had already been sent to the Department of Finance for processing). When Mayor Chen heard this news, he was enraged. As soon as he returned to Hsinchu, he immediately summoned the chief secretary of the police bureau and asked who was behind it. The response was, "I don't know." He also asked, "Are the people in the police bureau also involved?" The response was, "Probably not!" The truth is that a group of small public employees, living hand-to-mouth, did it without consulting with their superiors, so the mayor could not find out the truth. The next day, he sent someone to the Department of Finance to copy the names of the people who made the report. After checking, it turned out that most of them were police officers from the police bureau. He immediately became furious, slammed the table, and shouted, "The police bureau is messing with me! These people (referring to the people who made the report) are all communists! They must be severely punished!" He immediately instructed Chen Shu-liang, the chief secretary of the city government, to summon two police bureau officers who were listed at the top of the report, and ordered the police chief to dismiss these people. At this time, it happened to be time to issue salaries for February (old pay scale). The mayor issued salary payment orders for all departments, but left out the police bureau's, saying, "Unless the names of the people who made the report are removed, the salaries will not be issued!" When this group of small public employees who made the report saw the mayor's attitude, they also held a meeting to discuss countermeasures. On the one hand, they petitioned higher authorities again, and on the other hand, they collected evidence of the mayor's corruption to report him. When the police chief saw that the situation was not right, he personally came forward to mediate, taking the blame on himself, and asking the people who made the report to write letters of repentance. This made the mayor think that the police chief was deliberately condoning his subordinates to mess with him. In a fit of anger, he ran to Taipei and told Director Wang of the Garrison Command that the police chief was deliberately "messing with him." He also reported to the Garrison Headquarters that "the staff of the police bureau are all communists!" The people at the Garrison Headquarters were shocked, "Is that so?" They quickly sent people to Hsinchu for a secret investigation. The result of the investigation was "not factual." This group of poor public employees who were labeled as communists were therefore discussing countermeasures again. It is not known how this farce will end!

### It is a Joy to Do Good: "Assisted Childbirth" Readers Respond with Donations in Silver Dollars

Continued Support Needed in May From All Sectors

This newspaper's readership's assisted childbirth fund benefits impoverished pregnant women, and this fund relies entirely on continuous donations from all sectors of readership.

A week ago, this column reported that donations were very few, while prices were soaring, and the cost per pregnant woman was unbearable, fearing that it would be difficult to continue; therefore, we made an urgent appeal to readers from all walks of life, hoping that it would not be interrupted. We were honored to receive a letter from long-time reader Chang Le-ju, suggesting launching a silver dollar donation campaign to meet urgent needs; once it was disclosed, enthusiastic people from all walks of life responded one after another. We deeply admire their ancient virtues and warm hearts!

Among the donating readers, there was Mr. Sun Guo-hua, and the charitable person from "Fengji" who wished to remain anonymous, who personally came to the office yesterday and each donated ten silver dollars, and gave many instructions on how to promote assisted childbirth for poor women, which was especially inspiring.

The assisted childbirth expenses for April have now been barely met, but the assistance funds for the women giving birth this month have yet to be secured, and are awaiting continued donations from enthusiastic people from all sectors. Many hands make light work, and we dare to believe that this meaningful good deed will definitely not be abandoned halfway.
