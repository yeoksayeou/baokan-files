### Arrangement Phase of the Peace Negotiation's Main Proposal: The Military Seeks Reasonable Equality; No Preconceived Notions Regarding the Constitution, Legal System, or Coalition Government; Ten-Member Committee to Hold Final Discussions

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 5th] The government's side is actively researching the peace negotiation proposal with the Communists, and preliminary opinions have been obtained on the most difficult issue of reorganizing the military. It is reported that the ten key members responsible for drafting the proposal have met several times in recent days. The method of their meetings involves each of the ten members providing their individual opinions and counter-proposals regarding the eight conditions proposed by the Communists. These are recorded one by one, then organized, summarized, and compiled into a complete set of opinions. A proposal will then be drafted based on these opinions. Liu Fei and Zhong Tianxin have been appointed to be in charge of the recording and organization work during the discussions. Premier Sun, in order to expedite the process, has obtained approval from Acting President Li to invite Wu Jingxiong and Gan Jiehou to assist. Wu and Gan have been permitted to attend the past several meetings as observers. Currently, the opinions of the ten key members have all been presented. Liu, Zhong, Wu, and Gan are engrossed in the work of organizing and summarizing, which is expected to be completed in two or three days. At that time, the ten key members will hold another meeting to discuss in detail. A reporter inquired with highly reliable authoritative sources on the evening of the 5th and learned that the opinions of the ten key members presiding over the peace talks are largely the same. They believe that although the issue of war criminals appears to be extremely important on the surface, it may actually have a role in (bargaining), and there will still be opportunities for negotiation in the future. Regarding the constitution, legal system, and coalition government, the government side has no preconceived notions, but must insist on striving for the people's freedom of life. The government side has also considered land reform and the confiscation of bureaucratic capital, but unfortunately, it has not been thoroughly implemented. There is no major contradiction between the government and the Communists on these points; however, the reorganization of the military is the most difficult of the practical issues. The source revealed that the military reorganization plan negotiated between the Kuomintang and the Communists in 1946 was an important reference for the ten key members during their research, but due to the passage of time, many aspects are no longer suitable. Some people believe that the most appropriate solution is "separate governance," but this approach is unlikely to pass and will probably not be proposed. Several key members advocate that the handling of the forces of both sides should be based on the principle of "from reorganization to unified organization." The so-called "reorganization" means that both sides will independently reorganize, reduce, and downsize all of their forces to the minimum, as the current national wealth and people's strength do not allow for the constant maintenance of millions of troops by the people. The so-called "unified organization" means that after both sides have completed their own reorganization, they will then be unified and become the national armed forces. The source pointed out that whether it is reorganization or unified organization, it is neither the five-to-one method of the Political Consultative Conference era, where the Communist army is incorporated into the National army, nor the Fu Zuoyi-style reorganization, where the National army is incorporated into the Communist army, but is based on the principle of reasonable equality and unified organization. As for the ratio, it is not intended to be stipulated, and will be left to be decided during formal negotiations between the two sides. Regarding the military reorganization issue, in addition to the opinions expressed by the ten key members, Liu Fei has also been designated to be responsible for discussing with military personnel separately and listening to the opinions of military leaders. The plan they propose will then be used as a reference for the ten-member committee's discussions.

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 5th] Minister of National Defense Xu Yongchang and Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong convened a meeting at the Ministry of National Defense on the morning of the 5th to discuss the issue of downsizing the National army, inviting military and political leaders from various regions who had arrived in the capital, as well as those in charge of the Ministry of National Defense. Several dozens of people attended, including He Yingqin, Bai Chongxi, Cheng Qian, Zhang Qun, and Guo Chan. Zhang Qun attended the political affairs meeting on the 5th, and left before it was dismissed to attend the meeting. It continued in the afternoon.

[Reuters Nanjing, 5th] Zhang Zhizhong and Wu Zhongxin flew to Xikou the day before yesterday and have been staying there since, continuing to meet with former President Chiang.

"President Zhesheng Jian, Minister Zhong arrived in Shanghai and received a great demonstration, which is very grateful. Shun and others came to Beijing yesterday, and silently observed the current situation. I feel that there is nothing to do and nothing to say. If the government does not make the greatest determination to reform thoroughly, I am afraid that it will not be able to save the lost hearts of the people. Therefore, I still earnestly ask you to relieve Shun of his duties during the reorganization to clarify responsibilities and reduce offenses. I pray for your understanding and luck. Zuo Shunsheng·Lin Keji, March 5, 38th year".

Although the legislative members in Guangzhou have different suggestions, they seek unity, take into account the overall situation, and safeguard the interests of the country and the people. As far as I know, everyone has the same heart. There is no difference.

### HSBC Chairman Morse on the Situation in China

[Reuters Hong Kong, 5th] HSBC Chairman Morse delivered a speech at the bank's annual shareholders meeting today, stating: Since foreign merchants set foot on Chinese soil, the situation in China has not been more unfavorable to foreign merchants than it is today. However, he also does not believe that Chinese and foreign merchants with business experience on the Chinese coast will be discouraged by this. Both the Chinese government and Communist Party leaders are determined to industrialize China, so foreign machinery and investment are still necessary for China. He feels that China's current development is not entirely due to corruption and mismanagement, but because the government has been too slow to address the needs of farmers. Therefore, the centuries-old history of China seems to be a continuous performance of peasant rebellions, which today tends towards the Communist line.

### UN Commission on the Status of Women to Hold Meeting on the 21st

### Guangzhou Shipping and Seafarers Associations Oppose Opening of Wuzhou; Telegraphed the Executive Yuan to Request Revocation

[Our Guangzhou Bureau, 5th] The Guangzhou Shipping and Seafarers Associations recently telegraphed the Executive Yuan on the issue of opening Wuzhou as a foreign trade port, requesting revocation of the decision. The original telegram stated: Wuzhou is located in the hinterland of South China, far from the coast, and there is really no need to set up customs and become a foreign trade port. This move undoubtedly repeats the mistakes of the Qing Dynasty, damages the country's inland waterway rights, hits state-owned enterprises, and affects people's lives.

[Reuters Guangzhou, 5th] Most Chinese shipping companies here feel uneasy after the Chinese government opened Wuzhou as a foreign trade port and allowed foreign ships to dock, fearing that Hong Kong shipping organizations will invade the Xijiang River and cause ships traveling between Wuzhou and Guangzhou to suffer. At present, only tugboats travel between Xicheng. After the opening, Hong Kong steamers can directly reach Wuzhou, and passengers and cargo will inevitably flock to them.

### Xinjiang Province Sino-Soviet Aviation Agreement Term is Said to be 50 Years

[United Press City News] According to Nanjing news: Zhang Zhizhong, Chief of Northwest Military and Political Affairs, suggested giving the Soviet Union exclusive rights to the province's trade and aviation for a term of 50 years, which was opposed by other government personnel. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed a revision: first, shorten the term of the new Soviet agreement; second, replace the Soviet Union's patents with the most-favored-nation clause. The most-favored-nation clause is applied to this agreement, meaning that China hopes that the Soviet Union and other countries considered to be the most-favored-nation will enjoy the same rights in the new province. According to the usual diplomatic customs, all contracting countries can actually be regarded as quantum-favored nations, so the significance of this article is no different from implementing an open-door policy in Xinjiang Province. Although Zhang went south, his representative is still in Dihua to contact Soviet personnel, instead of being presided over by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Chinese government formally notified the Soviet Union last September that it intended to abolish the Sino-Soviet Aviation Agreement, but according to Central News Agency news, five Soviet representatives have arrived in the capital of Xinjiang Province, not only to discuss the conclusion of a new civil aviation agreement, but also to address broader issues, such as the relationship between Xinjiang and the Soviet Siberian republics. In addition, the negotiators on both sides may also discuss the continuous conflicts between various ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The previous rumors that the Soviet Union would obtain exclusive rights to exploit Xinjiang's minerals have been denied by Zhang.

### Star Weekly Forum: An Attempt at a New Printing Method

— Shi Rong

—One of the Printing Reports from the Annual Meeting of the Chinese Science Journal Association—

Printing is fundamentally a crucial tool for culture. Not only should the application procedures be simple and convenient, but the costs should also be low and economical. This way, it can be supplied to society for widespread adoption, achieving the goal of disseminating culture and promoting progress. In any country where letters form words, its printing method has been changed from manual typesetting to machine typesetting, such as Linotype. Machine typesetting only requires the original manuscript to be typed once with a special typewriter. Then, all the lead characters are cast and arranged. After another step of plate arrangement to properly arrange the layout, plates can be made and printed, which is quite simple and convenient. Moreover, since there are not many letters to use, it is easy to train skilled workers to become specialists. Not only that, but the lead characters retrieved by the Linotype typewriter have fewer manual errors, making proofreading easier to say the least.

Judging from Chinese characters, about 3,000 characters are commonly used. If rare characters are included, there are no less than 6,000 characters. When typesetting and printing are required, not only is a lot of equipment needed, but also, due to the inability to use machines for character retrieval and arrangement, and the excessive number of character types, many errors can easily occur, not to mention the considerable time spent on arrangement and proofreading. Furthermore, if the text includes mathematical formulas or chemical structural formulas, the typesetting procedure is even more complicated, which is beyond the capabilities of ordinary printing companies.

All the inherent defects in Chinese printing are well known, and research and improvement are urgently needed. Although I, as the publisher of "Modern Railway" magazine, have little research on printing technology, I still hope that those engaged in culture will actively improve it. Therefore, I changed to using a Chinese typewriter to first type the manuscript, then used photographic reduction, and finally used rubber plate printing. After several months of research and improvement, fortunately, I have achieved preliminary success. As the Chinese Science Journal Association is holding its second annual meeting, I am submitting a report on the process of improving the printing method for reference. Moreover, although this preliminary achievement is still far from ideal and cannot be regarded as a final conclusion, the matter concerns the key tool for opening up culture, so I dare not keep it secret. I would be very grateful if printing experts would give guidance and even conduct joint research!

It is found that the original manuscript for phototypesetting must have uniform ink color, and the thickness of the strokes must be consistent, especially if there are missing strokes, which is not allowed. Otherwise, the photographed negative will be difficult to be clear and pleasing to the eye. Therefore, the text of ordinary photographic rubber plates must first be typeset with lead characters and then phototypeset to obtain a complete typeface. This procedure is very uneconomical. The ordinary use of this method is only when there are copperplate pictures, and a small amount of explanatory text is attached below. Because the area occupied is not large, it is adopted to save the cost of copperplate. As for other text printing, it is limited to letterpress printing, and there are not many who use this method.

"Modern Railway" magazine, in order to improve the printing method, once adopted this method to type the manuscript with a typewriter. During the initial experiments, the typed characters had extremely uneven ink color. If black carbon paper was used instead of ink, the strokes were not very clear. If enlarged and examined in detail, each stroke was blurred with ink on both sides, which was not pleasing to the eye. After several studies, very thin paper was used. Black ink was used on the front, and black carbon paper was lined on the back. Then the typed characters were more uniform in color and could be barely used. The recent issues of "Modern Railway" magazine have adopted this method to first make a manuscript before rubber plate printing.

It is also found that the typefaces in Chinese typewriters only have one type, while typesetting manuscripts must use various sizes and styles of typefaces to meet the needs. To solve this difficulty, "Modern Railway" magazine used typewriters for the main text, while the titles, headings, and other special typefaces were written manually in various graphic typefaces and supplemented. Fortunately, these specially made typefaces are not common in the manuscript, and it is also easier to write large typefaces. Although the typewriter typeface only has one size, it can be reduced to a certain expected size by photography. According to the past experience of "Modern Railway" magazine, it is very satisfactory and without difficulty to reduce the original text to between No. 5 and No. 6 size characters. It is not very suitable to enlarge or reduce it too much. In short, typefaces with a size of about No. 5 or No. 6 can be used for any magazine.

In Chinese typewriters, there is no way to solve the problem of inserting numerical formulas or chemical equations. In this case, one can only rely on manual writing and insert it into the main text. If you are in the general engineering profession, it is not difficult to write typefaces or formulas with graphic typefaces. Those with a little experience can cope with it easily. Therefore, there is actually no difficulty in supplementing the various typefaces mentioned above.

Furthermore, the calculation methods for printing costs, letterpress printing and photographic rubber plates are different and must be compared individually to understand. Compared with the cost of typesetting and casting zinc or copper plates, the former is indeed cheaper, but the labor cost of printing with rubber plates is more expensive. This fact is even more obvious when quoting a small number. Also, when letterpress printing encounters horizontal typesetting, tables, or mathematical formulas, additional costs are required according to the regulations. If there are copper and zinc plates in the text, in addition to the cost of making the plates themselves, the space occupied still needs to be calculated as typesetting labor, which is not cost-effective. Using the "Modern Railway" magazine method, when printing horizontal rows or tables and mathematical formulas, the printing cost is equal to that of vertical lines, and the increase in cost is not too much. Moreover, direct photography by this method eliminates the cost of making copper and zinc plates, which is even more considerable.

As mentioned above, compared with the overall cost, the various costs required for photographic rubber plates are far cheaper than letterpress printing. "Modern Railway" magazine has benefited greatly since trying this method.

What's more, "Modern Railway" magazine does not consider itself an inventor by adopting this method, because similar methods have long existed in European and American countries. For example, the Vari-Typer typewriter currently sold in European and American markets can type various types of typefaces. It uses specially made thin paper and colored ribbons and is typed by electric methods. The typefaces are uniform and the strokes are clear and bright. The printed products are comparable to letterpress printing, which can be called perfect. Currently, general Chinese typewriters in China have too many shortcomings, so the typing results are difficult to be satisfactory. However, after the initial attempt by "Modern Railway" magazine, a satisfactory result has been obtained. It is still hoped that publishers will promote it together, study it in detail, and obtain more advanced results. If electric typewriters are launched in the future and supplied at low prices (Gao Zhongqin has already produced them, and Lin Yutang has also successfully tested them in the United States), the typing results should be improved, which is predictable.

Due to the initial attempt of "Modern Railway" magazine, not only is it considering economic aspects, but it also hopes to lead to another path in terms of using the spirit of research, and to make a new reform in China's printing methods. This humble intention still hopes that all publishing experts will work together to achieve success.

At present, China's printing industry, Shanghai is second to none. Not only is the equipment substantial, but also the technology is excellent, and the products are perfect. In the mainland, it is currently impossible to hope to be comparable to Shanghai. However, if you want to obtain excellent printing, you can still use the above method, first submit the manuscript for typing and finishing, and then mail it to Shanghai for printing, which is very convenient.

### Improving the Treatment of Public Education Personnel: Restoring the Method of Monthly Adjustment, Determining Standards Based on the Cost of Living Index for the Current Month; Approved by the Executive Yuan's Temporary Political Affairs Meeting

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The method for improving the treatment adjustment of public education personnel proposed by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics has been approved at today's temporary political affairs meeting of the Executive Yuan. Starting from March of this year, the method of monthly adjustment based on the cost of living index standards in various regions will be restored, and a portion of the allowance will be prepaid at the beginning of each month according to the supply standards of the previous month. However, the calculation method of the salary base will be changed from the original 40% for the base of 60 yuan and above to 300 yuan, and 20% for the base of 300 yuan and above, to 20% for the base of 60 yuan and above to 300 yuan, and 10% for the base of 300 yuan and above. The new adjustment method is recorded as follows:

(1) Starting from March of this year, the treatment of public education personnel will be adjusted according to the cost of living index of civil servants in various regions for the current month; (2) The base number in the salary is 60 yuan, and the part above the base number is 20% for 60 yuan to 300 yuan, and 10% for 300 yuan to 7; (3) At the end of each month, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics shall formulate a regional adjustment supply standard table based on the cost of living index of civil servants obtained from the survey and submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation; (4) At the beginning of each month, the salary of employees of various agencies shall be prepaid according to the supply standard of the previous month. After the adjustment plan is approved at the end of the month, the increased portion will be paid retroactively. If there is an overdraft, it will be deducted from the prepaid amount in the next month; (5) In March, the salary of employees of various agencies shall be prepaid three times the supply standard of February. After the adjustment plan is approved at the end of the month, the refund will be made according to the previous article; (6) The annual fee and public fee of legislators and supervisors and the public fee of people at all levels will be adjusted accordingly and calculated according to the standards of the government's location.

According to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, the treatment of public education personnel is adjusted monthly in accordance with the regional verification standards of the cost of living index in various regions, which has been implemented for a long time and has been gradually improved. Until the currency system was reformed in July of last year, and price limits were implemented, salaries and wages were frozen, and the adjustment method was abolished. Later, prices gradually rose, and employees' lives could not be maintained. Referring to past methods, three adjustments were made one after another from November of last year. However, due to the government's economic situation, on the one hand, it is necessary to consider technical issues such as the calculation of payment and receipt, and on the other hand, the results obtained from the regional formulation of standards are inevitably different from the actual situation in various regions, especially when prices fluctuate drastically; After detailed research, the Ministry believes that the method revised in June and July last year, which adjusts treatment according to the index of the current month, is closer to reality, and the prepayment of a portion of the salary at the beginning of each month also has a great impact on employees' lives. The Ministry has put forward improvement opinions on both adjustment methods and payment.

### Sudden Increase in National Treasury Expenditure: Decision to Reduce Military and Political Spending

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] According to a certain financial official, on the 5th, he told reporters: The implementation of the public education personnel treatment adjustment method passed by the Executive Yuan on the 5th has resulted in a sudden increase in national treasury expenditure by several times, which is an excessive burden. However, the adjustment of the treatment of civil and military public education personnel is due to the government's decision to reform politics. In the political reform plan, some unnecessary agencies and redundant personnel will be eliminated separately, and all institutions will be simplified to strengthen work efficiency, so as to save expenses and reduce the burden on the national treasury. The most difficult thing is the issue of military expenditure. The military personnel, including soldiers, account for a large proportion of the military pay item. When discussing the treatment issue at the political affairs meeting on the 5th, there were many concerns about this. President Sun Ke previously advocated reducing the number of officers and soldiers to 550,000, but in fact it still exceeded the actual number, and the national treasury could not afford it. Therefore, the financial authorities still insisted on reducing it to save the amount and transfer it to increase treatment needs; The Ministry of National Defense also had many difficulties due to the limitations of the facts. After Minister Xu Kan and Minister Xu Yongchang discussed the results in detail at the meeting on the 5th and after the meeting, it was decided to approve the number of 4.2 million people. Although the number reduced was not very large, it was not a small help to the national treasury. As for the reduction and tightening of various institutions in the political aspect, it has not yet been implemented. If it can be done in accordance with the reform plan, although the treatment of public education personnel has increased several times, the actual increased expenditure will be reduced proportionally. In addition, the government's tax revenue will increase by one example, and the national treasury revenue and expenditure should not be too large.

### Central Bank Managers Transferred in Xi'an, Hangzhou, and Other Places

As for Wu Yong, the manager of the Kunming Branch, he has been dismissed for improper handling when the counterfeit currency case occurred, and Zhao Kangjie has been assigned to fill the position.

### Agreed on the Amount of Military Expenditure: Xu and Xu Yongchang Discussed the Results, Still Based on 4.2 Million People as the Standard

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The issue of the amount of military expenditure in March was first brought up for discussion at the political affairs meeting on the 5th. The Ministry of National Defense still insisted that the minimum number of troops should be 4.2 million, and the military expenditure in March should still be supplied according to this standard. The heads of the Ministry of Finance, Food, and Budget insisted on further reducing it. After much discussion, no conclusion was reached until the meeting adjourned. After the meeting, Xu Kan and Xu Yongchang studied it again and agreed to supply it according to 4.2 million people.

### Regarding the Issuance of Silver Dollars: The Amount Has Not Been Determined

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The issue of issuing silver dollars to military personnel and soldiers was also discussed at the meeting on the 5th.

### Mediation of the Xiangxi Incident: Dai Jitao and Others Are Expected to Arrive in Yuanling Yesterday; Li Mo'an Denies Rumors of Resignation

[Our newspaper, Changsha, 5th] Zu Mo'an solemnly denied that Wai Fuqu would resign due to the Xiangxi incident. The rebellious people trapped in Yuanling are still wantonly slandering Li.

### The Chinese Communist Party Wants to "Revolutionize" to the End: The Central Plains Communist Army Enters a Training Boom; The Communist Party Accuses the National Army of Reorganizing New Troops

[Our newspaper] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: The Xinhua News Agency in northern Shaanxi broadcast the day before yesterday. The Beijing news reported that Ye Jianying, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, attended the "National Student Congress" convened in Ping on March 1 and said, "The PLA has destroyed 5 million Kuomintang troops, and true people's peace is already possible. We must not only break the Kuomintang's false peace, but also carry out the revolution to the end."

Also, the Xinhua News Agency in northern Shaanxi broadcasted on the 5th, a message from the Central Plains on the 3rd: The various departments of the Central Plains Field Army have now mostly entered a training boom. All the troops that have completed political mobilization and ideological preparation have entered a training boom. The soldiers practiced bridging, boarding and disembarking, and making straw sandals. The cooks practiced cooking rice. All cadres and soldiers are striving to complete the training plan. Prepare to meet "new tasks".

[Our newspaper] The Communist Party Radio broadcast on the 5th, with the title "Pay Attention to the Conspiracy of the National Faction to Deploy a New War", commenting on the current situation, referring to the reorganization of new troops, US aid to continue to aid China, and carrying out open war mobilization. It is one of the tactics used by the Chinese Communist Party to deploy troops north of the Yangtze River to exert military pressure on peace talks. Observers believe that although peace talks are about to begin, there may still be some bloody incidents during the start of the peace talks and the negotiation period. The Communist Party Radio's current rhetoric on the preparation of the government army is the prelude to the Communist army's desire to use military force to cooperate with the peace talks.

### Molotov and Mikoyan Dismissed, Vyshinsky Appointed Soviet Foreign Minister, Menshikov Succeeds as Minister of Foreign Trade

[Associated Press London Dispatch, 4th] Moscow Radio announced on the 4th that Molotov, who has been the Soviet Foreign Minister for ten years, and Mikoyan, the Minister of Foreign Trade, have been dismissed. The broadcast stated that Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky has succeeded Molotov. This is the biggest change in the Soviet cabinet since the war. According to the broadcast, "The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet has decided to approve Comrade Molotov's dismissal from the concurrent position of Foreign Minister and to appoint Comrade Vyshinsky as Foreign Minister. Comrade Mikoyan, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, has been approved to be dismissed from the concurrent position of Minister of Foreign Trade, and Comrade Menshikov has been appointed as Minister of Foreign Trade." Molotov's rank is second only to Premier Stalin. Before the war, Molotov was the Premier of the Soviet Union. Molotov succeeded Litvinov as Foreign Minister in 1939. In 1941, when Germany attacked the Soviet Union, Stalin became Premier. [Associated Press London Dispatch, 4th] Western diplomats, upon hearing that Vyshinsky, who has repeatedly exaggerated his influence in international conferences, has replaced the thoughtful Molotov as Soviet Foreign Minister, immediately raised a question: "What will the Kremlin do now?" Is Stalin preparing to retire and delegate power to his most trusted comrade, Molotov, to be responsible for the Soviet Communist Party Politburo, or is Stalin preparing for another twist in his ever-changing foreign policy? Obviously, Molotov remains Deputy Premier (Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers), so there is no doubt that Mr. Molotov continues to be the most powerful figure in Soviet politics after Stalin. But since the Soviet Union last changed its foreign minister, no action has attracted as much attention from the West as this one, and in the last change, Molotov replaced the great friend of the West, Litvinov, and in this change, neither Molotov nor his loyal deputy, Vyshinsky, can be called friends of the West, so the motives are even more unclear. Westerners believe that Vyshinsky's succession as Foreign Minister shows that the Soviet Union will adopt a tough attitude towards the West because Vyshinsky has always appeared as a red figure in previous international conferences. Therefore, if the Kremlin is planning a tough policy towards the West, Vyshinsky is the most ideal person to implement it, but Vyshinsky's power is probably only in execution. At the same time, if Stalin plans to give Molotov greater powers, Vyshinsky, with his many years as Deputy Foreign Minister, is certainly the most suitable successor. If this speculation is true, then this change is just a change of roles and will continue the same policy.

[Associated Press Prague Dispatch, 4th] Vyshinsky has returned to Moscow after visiting the famous Czech resort of Karlsbad for several weeks. It is said that Mr. Vyshinsky arrived here last month for recuperation, and it is generally believed that Mr. Vyshinsky met with several foreign Communist Party leaders, including the leader of the German Communist Party.

### Future Trend of Soviet Diplomacy: Washington Maintains a Wait-and-See Attitude, Believes There is No Hope for Improvement in US-Soviet Relations

[United Press Washington Dispatch, 5th] Foreign policy officials and members of Congress today speculated about Vyshinsky's succession as Foreign Minister, but there was no consensus. Some said this was a dangerous move in the Cold War between East and West, others said the Soviet Union would adopt a softer attitude towards Western countries, and others said it was just a normal political transfer. But everyone agreed that only by waiting for future developments can the situation be clarified.

President Truman, Secretary of State Acheson, former Secretary of State Marshall, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Connally, and former Chairman Vandenberg all declined to comment. Senator Smith, a Republican member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, predicted that the Soviet Union would take some drastic action, possibly military action against Norway and Denmark. The Soviet Union's policy has become tougher due to the situation in China and other places. Congressman Richards, a Democrat, believes that the new action will go in one of two directions: either tougher on the United States or improved relations with the United States. Republican Senator Ferguson said that there is no hope for improved international relations in the future, and they may worsen. Vyshinsky's anti-American rhetoric has always been more intense than Molotov's. It is still remembered that when Molotov succeeded Litvinov as Foreign Minister, it was widely believed that the Soviet Union could be friendlier to Western Europe and the United States. Unexpectedly, the Soviet Union suddenly signed a non-aggression treaty with Nazi Germany before World War II.

### Mikoyan's Dismissal Particularly Emphasized by Britain and France

Considered an Omen of Intensified Cold War

[Associated Press London Dispatch, 5th] The British Foreign Office received a "urgent report" from Ambassador Peterson to the Soviet Union on the 5th, which stated that Molotov's departure was a promotion rather than a demotion. British Foreign Office officials believe that this announcement has been overemphasized and warned against overemphasizing the transfer. French sources believe that Mikoyan's dismissal as Minister of Trade is more important and more ominous, because Mr. Mikoyan is the most Western-minded person in the inner circle of the Kremlin. Western European diplomats also know that this transfer may mean the continuation and even intensification of the struggle between East and West. Some Soviet experts even believe that Vyshinsky's replacement of Molotov as Foreign Minister may only be another transfer of important officials in preparation for Stalin's successor. No matter what the meaning of the sudden transfer, Molotov and Mikoyan are still members of the Soviet Politburo, while Vyshinsky and the new Minister of Trade Menshikov are not. The Politburo is the highest authority in the Soviet Union that makes real decisions.

### Only a Strategic Change, Not a Change of Policy

Hint from the Czech Official

[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 5th "Broadcast: Prague Dispatch, well-informed Czech sources said that the change of Soviet Foreign Minister may only be a change in diplomatic strategy and not a change in diplomatic policy. A Czech official said, "In the near future, Vyshinsky may be more suitable to implement foreign policy." The general Czech people were surprised by this news. Hungarian officials refused to comment on this, and this news was not even published in today's evening newspaper.

[Associated Press Washington Dispatch, 5th] Political figures here said that the Soviet Union may now be preparing to formulate a plan aimed at consolidating its post-war gains in Eastern Europe, rather than expanding its control. But they stressed that if there is any change in Soviet policy, it will be in terms of strategy rather than objectives. They also warned not to think that the Soviet Union has abandoned its long-term plan to control the world.

### Vyshinsky's Brief Biography

Soviet Union's new Foreign Minister Vyshinsky was born in 1883 in Odessa, Ukraine, and graduated from the Faculty of Law of Kiev University. In 1902, he joined the Social Democratic Party and engaged in revolutionary activities. In 1905, he worked in Baku, Caucasus, and was arrested and imprisoned several times. In 1923, he practiced law. In 1925, he became a law professor at Moscow University. From 1935, he served as a prosecutor. During the Soviet Purge, Vyshinsky was the prosecutor of the Purge Court, and his reputation rose from then on. In 1937, he was elected as the director of the Institute of Law of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In 1938, he was elected as the Deputy Chairman of the People's Committee, and later changed to the Deputy Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and represented at the Mediterranean Alliance Conference and the Paris Peace Conference. In 1946, the first session of the United Nations General Assembly was held in London, and he served as the chief representative of the Soviet delegation. Later, the United Nations General Assembly was held twice in New York, and he served as a representative. In 1947, he attended the London Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference with Molotov. He served as the chief representative of the Soviet Union at the Danube Conference. Vyshinsky is intelligent, capable, eloquent, and argued with Western diplomats at various international conferences. He was awarded the Order of Lenin three times in 1937, 1943 and 1945.

### Soviet Newspapers Did Not Comment

Only Published Brief News

[Associated Press Moscow Dispatch, 5th] Moscow newspapers on the 5th only published two brief pieces of news about the dismissal of Molotov and Mikoyan on the back page, each only 29 words long. No newspapers commented.

### Observations of United Nations General Public: Soviet Policy Will Not Change, Molotov's Dismissal is Actually a Sign of Promotion

[United Press Success Lake Dispatch, 4th] When the news of the dismissal of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov came, the United Nations representatives here were all surprised. A diplomat commented that Molotov's dismissal was actually a sign of promotion, and Soviet policy would not change. Molotov is still the Deputy Prime Minister, and may replace Stalin as Prime Minister. Molotov's resignation as Foreign Minister can relieve some of the burden.

Other diplomats believe that it is not yet known whether Molotov will be promoted. Soviet experts initially heard the news of Molotov's resignation and believed that this was an attempt by the Soviet Union to befriend Western countries. When they heard that Mikoyan had resigned as Minister of Foreign Trade, they felt that there was no change in Soviet policy. Mr. Mikoyan is considered one of the most Western-friendly of the 14 members of the Soviet Politburo. The new Foreign Minister Vyshinsky will definitely continue the Cold War and intensify his attacks on the West. Mr. Vyshinsky did his best at the United Nations Paris General Assembly last autumn and obviously won the favor of Moscow authorities. Mr. Vyshinsky delivered many speeches at the meeting attacking the United States, Britain and France. The general public originally thought that Mr. Vyshinsky would re-appoint the head of the Soviet delegation at the United Nations New York General Assembly in April this year. After being promoted to Foreign Minister this time, it is speculated whether he will attend in person or let Deputy Foreign Minister Malik attend. Another Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko may make a comeback.

### Public Utility Rates Calculated in Customs Gold Units; Ministry of Finance Cables Shanghai Requesting Cessation; Mayor Explains This Was a Last Resort Measure

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The calculation of public utility fees in Shanghai in Customs Gold Units was not approved by the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance has cabled Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen, pointing out that it is inappropriate to charge for public utilities in Customs Gold Units and requesting that it be stopped.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since public utilities in this city changed to Customs Gold Unit pricing, the general reaction has been one of feeling overwhelmed by the burden. All parties believe that Customs Gold Unit prices are linked to the US dollar, so changing public utility pricing to Customs Gold Unit pricing is tantamount to changing to US dollar pricing in disguise, which obviously undermines the value of the Gold Yuan. General business practices and the income of the salaried class are all based on the Gold Yuan, with the cost-of-living index serving as an indicator of the increase or decrease in the value of the Gold Yuan. It has not been heard that this indicator has been replaced by the Customs Gold Unit, and since public utilities can use the Customs Gold Unit as a pricing standard, other items such as rent and general prices will follow suit and change the pricing base, which will inevitably plunge the people's livelihood and the future of the Gold Yuan into despair.

Due to the public's opposition, Mayor Wu explained to reporters yesterday afternoon that the decision to take this measure was a last resort. He recounted the economic difficulties faced by various public utility companies, stating that: Because public utility costs are directly affected by rising foreign exchange rates, they often suffer from economic turnover issues. In February, an economic panic occurred three times, and loans totaling more than 800 million Gold Yuan were borrowed from the National Bank and the Central Bank to overcome the difficulties. The last time, the company had no money to pay employee salaries, and I personally requested a loan from President Liu of the National Bank. President Liu replied that he was unable to do so due to a shortage of cash. After I pleaded with him again and told him that various companies might face the risk of water and electricity cuts, President Liu tried his best to find a way to reluctantly lend more than 200 million Gold Yuan. Based on this experience, if the economic problems of public utilities themselves are not thoroughly resolved, it is expected that they will be unable to continue to operate this month. Moreover, since the government announced the new economic plan, resolving that the central government will no longer provide subsidies, the self-reliance of public utilities is now an immediate issue. Therefore, knowing that the implementation of the new adjustment plan would inevitably face criticism from all sectors, in order to maintain public utilities, this measure had to be taken.

Mayor Wu also stated that although the pricing unit for public utilities is based on the Customs Gold Unit standard, it is actually based on the "August 19" base number of the Gold Yuan. When the government issued the Gold Yuan, it stipulated that four Gold Yuan were equal to one US dollar, which is one Gold Yuan equal to two and a half US cents. The current public utility unit uses this as the base number. Wu also stated that after the public utilities were adjusted using the Customs Gold Unit, most citizens were not affected. For example, stores and factories adjust their prices daily, so they can afford public utilities. As for the salaried class, if they are paid according to the cost-of-living index, there will be no disconnection, because the city government's statistics show that the rise in the cost-of-living index is balanced with foreign exchange rates. As for those most directly threatened by the adjustment of public utilities to the Customs Gold Unit, they are public school teachers. The city government is currently trying to provide employees with water and electricity subsidies to compensate for this.

### Public Utilities Group of City Council to Hold Meeting to Study; Speaker Meets with Mayor and Also Expresses Opposition

[Report from Our Newspaper] Speaker of the City Council Pan Gongzhan met with Mayor Wu at the City Hall at around 6:00 PM yesterday to discuss the pricing methods of public utilities. According to Speaker Pan's statement to reporters: Although adjusting the prices of public utilities is necessary, he personally opposes the settlement of standard units in Customs Gold Units. The Public Utilities Group of the City Council plans to convene a meeting to study the methods of adjusting the prices of public utilities and provide them to the City Hall for reference.

[Another Report] City Councilor Zhang Zhongyuan sent a letter to Mayor Wu to oppose the pricing of public utilities in Customs Gold Units, requesting him to withdraw his order. It is learned that Mayor Wu specifically invited Councilor Zhang to the City Hall for a talk yesterday, telling him that the City Hall approved the measure in order to maintain public utilities, hoping he would understand their difficulties. If there is a better way to solve the economic difficulties of public utilities, the City Hall will be willing to adopt improvements.

Labor Circles Express Protest

Since the prices of public utilities in this city have been charged according to Customs Gold Units, all sectors have expressed dissatisfaction, especially the workers in this city who feel that they cannot afford it. According to Zhou Xuexiang, Chairman of the General Labor Union, the adjustment of public utility prices this time is calculated in "Customs Gold Units," and the price changes daily, which is extremely unreasonable. He stated that the current rise in prices and the increase in the cost-of-living index mean that price adjustments are necessary, but this calculation method is actually leading to rising prices. Moreover, workers' income is in Gold Yuan, but payments need to be calculated by converting to Customs Gold Units, which affects the lives of workers. The General Labor Union has considered this issue and expresses its protest for the sake of the safety of the lives of workers throughout the city. It has been decided to request the relevant authorities to immediately stop charging fees according to this calculation method.

### Unit Discount Continues to Rise

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Public Utilities Bureau announced yesterday: The price of each public utility unit for the next two days (6th and 7th) is 937.5 Gold Yuan.

### Public Utilities Bureau Director Speaks; Payment Period for Water and Electricity Extended to Seven Days

[Report from Our Newspaper] Due to the criticism from all sectors regarding the Customs Gold Unit pricing of public utilities, the reporter visited Zhao Huijue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, at 5:00 PM yesterday to inquire about his views on this point. Director Zhao stated: The price of public utilities is based on Customs Gold Units in order to achieve the self-reliance of public utilities and has been done out of necessity. He stated: The City Hall has not forgotten the burden on citizens. In order to ensure that ordinary users are not affected by the Customs Gold Unit to Gold Yuan exchange rate adjustment, the Public Utilities Bureau has ordered Gu companies to extend the payment period for water and electricity to seven days. Each company should issue invoices within three days of meter reading, and users can pay within four days of receiving the invoice. The Public Utilities Bureau has also ordered the companies to base the exchange rate for payments within the time limit on the exchange rate on the date of meter reading, and only new exchange rates can be accepted after the deadline. In addition, the ordinary users mentioned above refer to users with a monthly consumption of less than 5,000 degrees in the Shanghai Electric Power Company area, less than 2,000 degrees in the French Zhabei and Pudong areas, less than 1,000 degrees in the Chinese business area, and less than 500 cubic meters of tap water (less than 300 cubic meters in the Pudong area). The Public Utilities Bureau also hopes that users can prepay so that they will not be affected by the Customs Gold Unit exchange rate adjustment.

### Commodity Tax Collection in Kind; Tobacco and Cotton Textile Industries Say They Cannot Afford It

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the issue of commodity tax collection in kind, the tobacco and cotton textile industries have recently convened meetings of industry leaders. The results have been uniformly recognized as unbearable.

### Inspection Tour of Pudong South Reveals People's Deep Suffering; Heavy Tax Burden; Rural Areas Have No Time to Breathe

[Report from Our Newspaper] The "Pudong South" area includes Fengxian, Chuansha, and Nanhui counties, and is bounded by the sea to the east, and is particularly closely related to this city. What is the recent trend in the area? The reporter went to inspect it yesterday and found a gratifying phenomenon, that is, the understanding and awareness of the local administrative staff of the necessary reforms in the current political situation has gradually become profound. The suffering of rural people in recent years has been increasing day by day. This kind of suffering is unimaginable for urban people. General local officials are at a loss in actual administrative experience, and they are gradually merging with the hopes of the people, and finally issue a call for political reform. Taking Fengxian County as an example, the county has a total population of only 240,000 people, but the burden of quotas is surprisingly heavy, such as the first phase of the conscription quota of 609 people, with a resettlement fee of 20 shi of white rice per person, totaling 12,000 shi; the supplementary levy of self-defense special donation of 25,000 shi in 37 years; the difference in non-staple food for the troops stationed in the territory requires 2,000 shi of rice per month; the construction of Pudong Avenue requires 3,000 shi of rice; this alone has made the current rural families of four or five people unable to breathe. On the one hand, the county government strictly urges collection, moving east to make up for the west, in order to cope with the supervision and payment of the superiors, but its own office expenses for all personnel are only more than 600 yuan per month.

Local Cadres Should Be Immediately Rectified and Trained

When the reporter met with Chen Xuan (see photo), the commander of the Su Southern, Sha, Hai, and Feng joint defense area, he said that improving the quality of the troops should first improve the treatment, so why not coordinate the resettlement fee and implement conscription? He also lamented the low efficiency of local administration, the corruption and incompetence of township chiefs, the county-level personnel accustomed to waiting for orders, with no construction concept, and the provincial-level and above authorities unable to deeply penetrate the countryside to find a cure. So the top and bottom only rely on a piece of official document to contact, and the situation will only get worse over time. He suggested that local cadres should be immediately rectified and trained, redundant personnel should be thoroughly cut, and the transformation of the material life and spiritual life of civil servants should be started at the same time. He also said that Fengxian County is currently doing this in this direction.

### "Corpse in a Suitcase Apparition"? Strange Tales at the North Train Station; Station Worker Sees Someone Pacing in the Next Room, Waking the Next Morning with Creeping Dread

[Report from our newspaper] The train suitcase corpse case has been jointly investigated by the Municipal Police Department and the Railway Police since yesterday. According to them, although new leads have been discovered, the case is still far from being solved. On the contrary, the case seems to be more complex and confusing, and has entered a frustrating stage of investigation. The precision of the actions and the thoroughness of the planning by the perpetrator in this case are rarely seen in past homicides. For example, the victim's family has not come forward, no fingerprints were left on the corpse pieces or the suitcase, and the person transporting the suitcase calmly escaped after bringing the corpse to the North Station, leaving no trace that can be used for investigation. All of this proves that the perpetrator(s) of this case are extremely cunning individuals with considerable criminal experience. Therefore, items such as the woman's overcoat and underwear found in the suitcase are likely to be a

smoke screen

deliberately set by the perpetrator to divert the attention of the detectives and mislead the investigation. Currently, the Municipal Police Department and the Railway Police are working hard, and they are not letting go of any clues that could aid the investigation. Chief Jin Zhiwen of the Railway Police Department, who is in charge of the case, has personally gone to Hangzhou to investigate, as it is unclear whether the "suitcase corpse" was transferred from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway or any station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, making Hangzhou a crucial investigation point.

North Train Station

Yesterday, strange tales of the "suitcase corpse" apparition seeking redress spread again. Although these events have no scientific basis, they are recorded for scholars of the soul to study. After the District Procuratorate examined the corpse a few days ago, all the large and small suitcases containing the corpse pieces, as well as the woman's overcoat, underwear, yellow military blanket, cotton batting, newspapers, and other items found in the suitcase, were taken back to the Railway Police for further investigation. These items were locked in the lost and found storage room of the Beijing-Tianjin Railway Police Section at the North Station. This room is located on the left side of the North Station's main hall, behind the main building, and is next to the temporary dormitory for construction workers. The two rooms are separated by wooden boards. The night before, only a station worker named Xu was staying in the dormitory. He did not know that such items were stored in the next room. In the middle of the night, Xu heard groaning sounds in his sleep, intermittent and weak. Xu sat up and listened carefully. He then heard the sound of teeth grinding, coming from the next room. Xu got out of bed and peered through a gap in the wooden wall. He saw that the light in the room was bright (the light in that room was left on all night), and someone was pacing back and forth in the room. Because the gap was very low, he could not

see the face.

Xu thought it was a criminal apprehended by the police and held in that room, so he went back to sleep. Around five o'clock in the morning, Xu got up to prepare for his shift. Remembering what had happened the night before, he went to check the next room again. He saw that the door was tightly locked and could not be opened. Looking inside through the small iron window in the upper half of the door, he saw only suitcases, cotton batting, and other items, but no one was there. Xu stood there dumbfounded for a long time, then quickly left. Recalling what he had heard and seen the night before, he felt a creeping dread and could not focus on his work. After being questioned by his colleagues, he finally revealed what had happened, and everyone was surprised. After the reporter received the news and went to interview him, Xu initially refused to admit it. After repeated inquiries, he finally said that it was true and described the events in detail to the reporter, seeming to still have lingering fear. The police authorities have since moved the suitcases and other items to another location to avoid further incidents of ghostly suspicion.

### National University and College Staff Association Cables Requests for Professional Development Funds

[Report from our newspaper] Shanghai's national universities and colleges presidents, faculty associations, and faculty fellowships appeal and request the allocation of professional development funds. The cable reads: "It has been observed that representatives of the faculty fellowships of national universities and colleges in this city, as well as presidents of various institutions, have successively gone to the capital to petition and appeal for increased compensation for all employees, and have achieved considerable results. Colleagues are deeply grateful. However, upon careful examination of the results of improved compensation, it is reasonably fair to teachers, students, and school workers, but the benefits for staff have not been given equal consideration, which seems inappropriate from a rational perspective. Generally, staff salaries are relatively low, and they do not receive research funds or hourly fees, nor can they hold outside jobs, making it difficult to maintain personal livelihood with their monthly income, let alone support a family. Moreover, staff members are also school employees, and research and professional development are equally necessary. Therefore, the Ministry of Education has long issued orders regarding staff professional development, but there are no funds available for the necessary expenses. Furthermore, according to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau's allocation of professional development funds to municipal primary and secondary schools, all faculty and staff are equally distributed and benefit from the tangible advantages, with precedents available for reference. Moreover, staff members work diligently throughout the year, cannot hold outside jobs, and do not have winter or summer vacations, relying solely on this meager salary to support their families. In addition to separate cables, we specifically cable your Excellency and your esteemed association to consider the hardships of our colleagues and approve the allocation of professional development funds to all full-time staff members, based on the amount of research funds received by lecturers and teaching assistants, to facilitate professional development and maintain livelihood. We urgently await your instructions."

### Two Major Fires in the Nanshi District; One Person Buried in the Flames on Fuyou Road; Over a Hundred Shanties Destroyed in Xieqiao

Suspicion of Arson by Clothing Store Owner; Newlyweds Flee Before Entering the Bridal Chamber

[Report from our newspaper] The Datongsheng Clothing Store at Nos. 84 to 86 Anren Street, Fuyou Road, in the Nanshi District, caught fire at approximately 1:20 AM yesterday. In an instant, fierce flames erupted, and tongues of fire shot out, quickly engulfing the adjacent Futai Cigarette and Paper Store at No. 80, the Meimei Barber Shop at No. 85 across the street, and several other shops and buildings, including the Yida Southern Goods Store. Upon receiving the report, fire brigades from various districts in the Nanshi District rushed to the scene with pump trucks to extinguish the fire, but the fire was too intense to control. At the same time, the Central Fire Department's observation tower also detected the fire and dispatched additional pump trucks to assist. It took an hour to extinguish the fire. However, the Datongsheng Clothing Store, Futai Cigarette and Paper Store, and Meimei Barber Shop, where the fire started, were completely destroyed. In addition, three shops and buildings at Nos. 83, 81, and 89 also suffered slight damage to their facades. During the fire, Xu Jinchou, the owner of the Futai Cigarette and Paper Store, was unable to escape and perished in the flames. As of 6:00 or 7:00 AM, the Yimiao Police Department was dispatching officers to work with firefighters from the Northern District Fire Brigade to excavate the burned body. Rumor has it that Ding Zizhang, the owner of the Datongsheng Clothing Store, is suspected of arson and has been detained for questioning by the local police station. [Report from our newspaper] Shanties in the Huixiang Lane area of Liyuan Road, Xieqiao, mainly inhabited by coolies, caught fire at approximately 2:05 PM yesterday. The fire started at the home of Yue Yacheng at No. 17, due to carelessness while cooking, and spread to the thatched roof above. It quickly spread, and fueled by the southerly wind, the fire spread even faster, turning the surrounding shanties into ashes in an instant. The fire also affected four tile-roofed houses at Nos. 1, 3, and 4 Fuan Lane, and 20 shops on Liyuan Road from No. 137 to No. 257. The most amusing incident was that of one household where the bride and groom were performing the wedding ceremony when the fire alarm suddenly sounded. The newlyweds immediately stopped the ceremony and rushed to save their dowry trunks and belongings. The guests also helped with the evacuation. The people had just escaped from the house when the new house was visited by the god of fire and was completely destroyed in an instant. Fire brigades from various districts in the Nanshi District and the Fire Department rushed to the scene to put out the fire, which was finally extinguished at 5:30 PM. It is estimated that over a hundred shanties and over twenty houses were destroyed.

### Readers Express Opposition to Public Utility Tariffs Based on Customs Gold Units

To the Editor: According to the report on March 2nd, the method of adjusting water and electricity fees and public transportation fares daily according to the Customs Gold Unit (CGU) may prevent losses for the companies, but it is unsatisfactory for the public. The main reason is that there is a gap of about ten days between the meter reading date and the arrival of the bill. During this period of rapidly rising prices, the CGU price is bound to increase daily, and the burden of this loss on the citizens is unbearable. Although there is a prepayment method, citizens will effectively be forced to pay an extra month's worth of water and electricity fees when they make their first prepayment. In this time of difficult living, it is even more difficult to cope. (2) The general situation in Shanghai is that, apart from the wealthy, most houses have three to five households, or even ten or more, sharing one water (or electricity) meter, and one person is entrusted to collect the money and pay the company. It is impossible for the entrusted person to collect the full amount in one day. As the CGU price changes from time to time, who will bear the difference?

In summary, the trouble of calculation and the waste of time in collecting the money are secondary. Therefore, it is necessary for the authorities to reconsider. I respectfully wish you good health. Reader Niu Weiqiao

### The Family of Fu Zuoyi: General Ma Jiyuan Once Visited

— Our Reporter Song Lin

[Airmail dispatch from Lanzhou on the 2nd] The Kunlun News (a temporary weekly publication) here published a short dispatch from Pingliang stating that the mother of Mr. Fu Yisheng (Zuoyi) is now residing in Pingliang. General Ma Jiyuan, the commander of the 82nd Army stationed there, visited her and conveyed greetings on behalf of his father, Chairman Ma Bufang. Below is the visit report personally written by this young general, who is only twenty-nine years old. General Ma Jiyuan has an extreme love for new literature. Even during the fierce battles in eastern Gansu last year, when military affairs were pressing, he never put down Western masterpieces. His study often displays portraits and quotations of great writers, which was commonly seen by Chinese and foreign reporters when they visited eastern Gansu last year. In this visit report, full of human sentiment, we can not only appreciate his fluent writing style and feel his abundant enthusiasm, but also reflect the view of a northwestern young general towards Mr. Fu Yisheng.

Like the Home of an Elementary School Teacher

Only the day before, I heard that the family of Mr. Fu Yisheng (Zuoyi) had departed from Xi'an for Pingliang, intending to go to Lanzhou. Later, I heard that Mr. Fu's mother had been living in Pingliang for nearly ten years! I was surprised, why didn't I know anything about it.

I first asked Deputy Director Li (reporter's note: Mr. Li is the Deputy Director of the 82nd Political Work Department) to visit once to inquire, and then I would go to visit. Mr. Li returned and said that it was true, that Mr. Fu's uncle and his family of more than ten people had gone to Lanzhou, and that the mother and family members who had been living here for a long time remained. He also said: "I didn't expect Mr. Fu's home to be so ordinary, as ordinary as the home of an elementary school teacher." When I heard this, I felt even more surprised!

The Mother Standing at the Door

Today, I specially prepared two baskets of fruits and went to visit the mother with Mr. Li. The home is located on West Street in Pingliang City, I forgot the street number. On the way, I felt that I was not going to visit the mother of a high-ranking official, but rather to visit my own aunt.

The mother stood at the door to greet us, very much like the nanny who held me when I was a child, as simple as a commoner. In a bedroom and living room, the mother sat on the kang (a heated brick bed), and told me to sit on the wooden stool next to the kang. There was no formality or courtesy, and a kind of intimate love filled this small and dark room.

Hanging on the wall was a large photograph of Mr. Fu from ten years ago, in military uniform, said to have been taken in Suiyuan during the anti-Japanese war. I can't tell fortunes, but I felt a sense of loyalty and filial piety. The admiration arose spontaneously. From our sincere and cordial conversation, I learned that Mr. Fu's wife used to spin and weave at home in Suiyuan, and now she is in Chongqing, and her children are continuing their studies. Mr. Fu's son wanted to buy a beloved bicycle, but because he had no cash, it was bought by someone else!

The Hall North Like a Doorman

Mr. Fu often said at home: "We should be the same as ordinary people." If you don't listen to him, he will yell.

When I conveyed the words of Vice Commander (reporter's note: refers to Ma Bufang, Deputy Commander of the Northwest Military and Political Administration and Chairman of Qinghai Province) greeting the mother, and that Vice Commander welcomed them to live in Qinghai, the old lady seemed very pleased. She repeatedly offered us a plate of fruits and a plate of peanuts.

After saying goodbye, I met Mr. Fu's cousin at the gate. Before the introduction, I thought he was a doorman!

A Deep Contrast

On the way back, I was deeply moved by this visit. Mr. Fu is such a hero, why did he fail? Is this the justice of heaven and earth? Many family members of important people enjoy a life of luxury on weekdays, and fly away at the first sign of trouble, even taking their foreign dogs and foreign cats with them. But Mr. Fu's family went to the northwest, moving to the rear, and Mr. Fu even said to them: "It would be best if you all went to Xining, to Chairman Ma's place." What a profound contrast!

China does not need wealthy families, nor does it need bureaucrats. The vast, poor people of China urgently need people like Mr. Fu to be their public servants. Why don't those who claim to be public servants of the people emulate Mr. Fu's spirit? Can I learn Mr. Fu's noble and upright spirit? I pondered, I trembled, and at the same time, I thought more about my subordinates and my colleagues, would they emulate the style of a great man like Mr. Fu? I pondered more, I trembled more.

### Rumors of Turmoil in Sichuan

— Our Reporter Zhou Xueduan

[Airmail dispatch from Chengdu on the 2nd] In February, Chengdu, the Jinjiang River is warm, it is indeed a great scenery. The peaceful society of the Jin City was suddenly wrinkled by foreign rumors: it is said that in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, it is rumored that "the situation in the suburbs of Rong is tense, and war is about to break out," but the people living here have indeed never smelled a hint of war. The spread of the rumor is bizarre. Exploring the thread, it should be that the provincial political authorities have strengthened their defenses and preparations for emergencies, and frequent military transfers have caused unexpected misunderstandings. The truth needs to be reported.

Rumors Spread Ripples in Sichuan Politics

In recent months, there have been many military transports in the suburbs of Rong. The reason is that some of the conscripts in Sichuan Province for the past two years are being transported, and some are engaged in training. Transfers from various places are inevitable. At the same time, the Sichuan Military District, on the order of the Ministry of National Defense, transferred some security regiment recruits to Shaanxi to replenish Hu Zongnan's troops. Hu's troops, in preparation for emergencies, evacuated their families to Sichuan. On the Sichuan-Shaanxi road, transports were endless, and the population of counties along the route increased frequently. The general public rumored that the Shaanxi army was moving south in a steady stream, attempting to retreat into Sichuan. Just when Liu Wenhui's 24th Army in Xikang, two regiments originally stationed in Xinjin and Shuangliu, were ordered to move to Wuhou Temple in Chengdu, Wang Lingji was going to Chongqing to visit Zhang Qun to report on his work. Leaflets jointly opposing Wang in the name of Zou Lan and six other regimental commanders of the Sichuan Security Regiment were found in Rong, which immediately aroused social speculation, believing that there was a gap between Wang and Liu, and that the Kang army entered Sichuan with the intention of overthrowing Wang. It also happened that the students of the 23rd class of the Army Military Academy graduated and held field exercises in the suburbs of Rong. The rumbling of vehicles and the neighing of horses added to the tense atmosphere. With the confluence of these two accidental events, rumors of turmoil in Sichuan spread in the southeast, and then spread into Sichuan, making the citizens of Chengdu, who were in the midst of it, feel confused.

Zhang Qun Returns to Rong Situation Clarifies

The spread of rumors will inevitably have a negative impact on the overall situation of unity and preparedness. Therefore, Zhang Yuejun specially returned to Rong with Wang Lingji ahead of schedule to visit Sichuan and Xikang generals and discuss the grand plan of unity. Zhang flew to Chengdu on the 14th of last month and stayed in Rong for three days, visiting social elders and holding several cordial talks with Liu Wenhui, Wang Xuxu, Wang Lingji, and others. He also attended the Provincial Senate and the joint welcome meeting of the National Assembly delegates, repeatedly emphasizing that Sichuan and Xikang are one family and must unite sincerely to respond to the changing situation. After this frank meeting, the rumors of chaos in Sichuan were thoroughly clarified. When Zhang returned with Wang, Liu Wenhui and Chuan Yi went to Chongqing to participate in Zhang's inauguration ceremony. The stars of Sichuan and Kang gathered in the capital, happily reminiscing and unifying their emotions, and the facts overturned the fantastic myths from outside. After taking office, Zhang convened an important meeting of the five southwestern provinces and cities to formulate a comprehensive reform plan for the current political, economic, and defense issues in the southwest, and took this plan to Nanjing. Wang Liu Deng (Xihou) then returned to Rong together to perform their respective tasks, in an atmosphere of peace, symbolizing Sichuan-Kang cooperation and building a bright future for the southwest.

Sichuan-Shaanxi Joint Defense Not Yet Concrete

Regarding the Shaanxi army entering Sichuan, the joint defense between Sichuan and Shaanxi had been brewing for a long time. The two provinces are interdependent and have always had close relations. In the recent evolution of the situation, Shu and Long are like Sichuan and Kang, brothers and one family, and there is no reason to separate them. The last time Wang Lingji and Hu Zongnan attended the military and political meeting in Beijing together, they had preliminary discussions on the specific plan for joint defense, that is, in the event of a sudden change in the situation, the Hu army would cooperate in defending Sichuan, and they exchanged opinions with each other. In the past month, the family members of the Hu army have been moving south in a steady stream, and the cities and counties along the Sichuan-Shaanxi line are full of evacuees, which is generally considered to be the prelude to the Hu army's entry into Sichuan. As a result, it caused considerable waves in Sichuan society. Most Sichuan people believe that Sichuan Province is currently organizing and training new troops and launching self-defense training, and its strength is sufficient to defend itself, so there is no need for neighboring provinces to provide assistance. At the tea party hosted by the Provincial Senate to welcome Zhang Qun, most of the provincial senators advocated that in the current situation, war and peace have not yet been decided, and there is no need for the Hu army to enter Sichuan. They should ask the authorities to politely decline the offer. At the same time, Hu Zongnan also sent a special letter to Chuan Yi, Speaker of the Sichuan Provincial Senate, inviting him to Xi'an to discuss the issue of joint defense. As of today, in addition to border defense cooperation and the designation of counties for defense in the joint defense zone, and unified military command, the entire plan for joint defense between the two provinces still needs to be thoroughly discussed, and there are no signs of the Hu army entering Sichuan. The claim that the Hu army is advancing into Chengdu is even closer to a myth. In short, the situation in Sichuan in the spring is indeed brewing for change, but the goal of brewing is to seek a more determined and more united response to change. Because if the overall situation is like this, attempting to split and divide will eventually lead to defeat. Under the power of the people, no bold warlord dares to risk the great disapproval of the world.

### Changzhou Security Company Causes Uproar in Xixiashu

[Our Newspaper Wujin, 3rd] A company of the first battalion of the county security regiment stationed in Anjiasha District, Xixiashu Town, has repeatedly clashed with the town over local supply issues. On the 3rd, as the head of the county security regiment, Zhu Fangyu, was personally gathering local people at the town's public office to talk, soldiers from the company unexpectedly surrounded the area and then rushed into the town's public office, using hand grenades to seriously injure two guards, Kong Songlin and Yuan Yinsheng, and confiscating their weapons. People were panic-stricken and all the shops in the town closed. The town's public office was vandalized, and the town head, Dan Xunyan, also disappeared. Zhu Fangyu, the head of the regiment who was on the scene, was unable to stop them. The situation was only brought under control after the 51st Army stationed near Menghe sent troops to suppress the riot. The people in the area were outraged by the news, and the district head, Yu Donghai, immediately reported the matter to the county government for investigation.

### Pursuit of Bandits in Zhangze Town, Songjiang

One Suspect and One Body Found

[Our Newspaper Songjiang, 4th] Zhangze Town, which belongs to the county, has many harbors and bays, making it a place where bandits often appear. At 8 p.m. on the 2nd, more than a dozen bandits with local accents infiltrated the town, intending to attack and seize weapons from the self-defense force. The head of the team, Sun Quanzhang, discovered them and tried to arrest them. The bandits opened fire to resist arrest. After the self-defense force returned fire, the bandits retreated and fled by swimming away. That night, Ye Shuren and Gu Yougen, two people suspected of being involved, were arrested. They claimed to be former soldiers of the 207th Division of the Youth Army and denied robbery. At dawn the next day, the body of a bandit with gunshot wounds was found in the Daqiao River. He was apparently trying to escape by swimming away. A county identity card from Bogen of the 12th household of the 6th Jia of the 6th Bao of Tinglin Town was found in his pocket. In addition to reporting the matter to the local prosecutor's office for inspection, the arrested Gu Yougen was escorted to the county government for interrogation. The town's defense has been reinforced with the deployment of the 2nd Battalion of the Security Regiment to maintain order.

### Wet Crabs on the Market

[Our Newspaper Beiqiao, 4th] Wet crabs, a specialty of Minhang Pujiang in Shanghai County, go on the market every year before the Qingming Festival when the weather is warm. Currently, they cost as much as 7,700 yuan per catty. When cooked with eggs into an egg skin, they taste extremely delicious. Unfortunately, the price is too high, and the elderly feel like they can only "sigh in vain for crabs."

### Price Increases Accelerating, Cash Funds Insufficient for Turnover, Banker's Drafts and Checks Flying Everywhere, Citizens Deeply Inconvenienced

[Our Newspaper] After continuous soaring prices, the cash tightness in the market has increased unabated. Although the Central Bank has issued large notes of 500 and 1,000 yuan, the number of issuers is still small. However, because trading prices have been rising daily in the general market, people have resorted to checks and bank drafts because of insufficient cash for turnover. Recently, we see the phenomenon of drafts and checks flying everywhere. In the past few days, the number of exchanges by the check clearing house has been approaching 400,000 per day, an increase of one-fold from the previous few days. The total amount of exchanges has been averaging 80-90 billion yuan per day, an increase of about 50% from the previous three or four days. However, the number of bounced checks has not increased significantly because the trend of monetary conditions is relatively stable.

[Another Dispatch] Due to the lack of issuance of 1,000-yuan banknotes, there has been an extreme shortage of cash chips on the market for consecutive days. The general lines of business are very strict in limiting the payment of cash. Some lines of business even issue bank drafts for checks of about 10,000 yuan, causing the phenomenon of bank drafts flying everywhere to occur again. Citizens all feel deeply inconvenienced. According to officials in charge of the issuing bureau of the National Bank, the authorities are extremely concerned about the phenomenon of cash panic in the market. 500-yuan banknotes have been issued in moderate amounts for circulation in recent days. As for the 1,000-yuan banknotes, they will be paid in stages as needed based on the facts in the future. However, as of yesterday, they have not yet been issued.

### Head Office Supply is Abundant, Money Tightens and then Relaxes

Yesterday morning, the monetary conditions in the city were stable before relaxing. At the start of the morning, the interbank overnight interest rate was around 70 yuan. Because it was the weekend, those with short positions sought outwards before 10 o'clock or so, and those with long positions held a wait-and-see attitude, so the trend was still relatively stable. However, by 11 o'clock or so, the head office supply was abundant, and those with long positions sought to lend out, and the secret interest rate decreased. Usually, it was around 60 yuan, and at one point, the low price of 55 yuan was seen. Near noon, as the wind of rising prices began to blow, those seeking short positions became active again, and the bid price rose back to between 60 and 65 yuan. The average market interest rate for each industry was around 60 yuan. Only rice and flour were lower, between 50 and 55 yuan. Man-made silk was made at 55 yuan to 60 yuan, and the stock exchange charged interest at 53 to 58 yuan. The interest rate of the National Bank did not move.

### Shanghai National Treasury Bureau Handles Gold Price Payment Procedures

All the above-mentioned winning number bonds and expired coupons will be temporarily handled by the Bureau in Shanghai for redemption.

### Implementation of Silver Dollar Deposits by Companies and Banks Encountered Many Difficulties

Regarding the preparations for silver dollar deposits in the financial industry in this city, the Financial Administration believes that the prospects are bleak after the implementation. According to the person in charge of the bureau, there are two reasons for this: (1) The management of silver dollar loans by lines of business was not a problem in peacetime when the economy was stable. However, in today's situation with too much price fluctuation, there are too many risks, and it is feared that it will be difficult to recover after the loan is released, and it may affect the business prospects of the lines of business. (2) After the silver dollar deposit is held, it is estimated that the deposit interest rate will only be around 2%. In today's situation of high market interest rates, this low interest rate is unwelcome by depositors. It is also impossible to make short-term overnight loans. Under these circumstances, there are many difficulties in whether to implement silver dollar loans. Also, the method of accounting for silver dollar deposits is that the Financial Management Bureau believes that it can be recorded as a "physical account," and silver dollars must never be used as the unit of account, and gold yuan must still be used as the unit of account.

### Banking Bureau Continues to Clear Out

[Our Newspaper] The National Banking Bureau continued to clear out 16,022 ten thousand yuan yesterday. Various banks cleared in 82,219,700 yuan for the large exchange.

### Money Loosens, Big Players Raise Prices, Chinese Stocks Nearly Full House

Yesterday, Chinese stocks launched an extremely fierce wave of rising prices. Near noon, nearly all stocks were rising, only a limited number of stocks such as Dongxing Shirts and Socks and Taiwan Sugar did not reach the limit. Yesterday, the money market was quite loose, with overnight interest rates at most at 6 Jiao, and about 5 Jiao was lent out near noon. Big players in the market strongly raised the prices of Yongsheng and Meiya to the limit. The number of small stocks reaching the limit exceeded all previous records. Yongsheng opened high at 4 yuan 5 Jiao 3 Fen. After opening, it continued to hover at a high level, and it was close to the limit twice. No. 156 fully resisted shorts. The low price was 4 yuan 4 Jiao 8 Fen. Around 11 o'clock, Securities No. 107 continued to raise prices, and retail investors followed suit. At 11:50, it reached the limit of 4 yuan 9 Jiao. The trend of Meiya also appeared to be rising all the way. It initially opened at 1 yuan 8 Jiao. It once fell to 1 yuan 7 Jiao 7 Fen as the gold price outside the market fell slightly. Retail investors bought when the price was low. At noon, as the gold price outside the market rose, the securities company continued to raise prices and went straight to the limit of 1 yuan 9 Jiao 3 Fen. Taiwan Sugar once reached the limit twice, but due to the limited interest rate for one day on Sunday, people sold them one after another, and the closing price fell to 30,000 yuan. The small stocks that reached the limit included China Cement at 4 Jiao 3 Fen, Zhenhua Paint at 2 yuan 5 Jiao 1 Fen, Zhabei Water and Electricity at 1 yuan 2 Jiao, Huafeng Enamel at 2 yuan 06 Fen, China-France Pharmacy at 8 Jiao 2 Fen, New Asia Pharmaceutical at 1 yuan 7 Jiao 4 Fen, Hengfeng at 1 yuan 2 Jiao 6 Fen, Xinhe at 1 yuan 6 Jiao 3 Fen, Jinglun at 1 yuan 6 Jiao 2 Fen, Xinhua Department Store at 1 yuan 2 Jiao 4 Fen, Xinguang at 4 Jiao 6 Fen, and 15 types including Commercial Press, Great China Match, and Wing On Company. The total turnover for half a day was 3,800,000,975 shares, including 152,700,000 shares of Yongsheng.

The market situation of the gold public bonds was that the initial price was 161,500 yuan, then it went to 165,000 yuan and rose to 170,000 yuan, and stayed there for a long time. It fell again to 165,000 yuan, and the final closing price was 168,000 yuan, with a fluctuation range of 8,500 yuan. It rose 8,600 yuan compared to the previous day. The total turnover was 236 taels.

Taiwan Sugar Dividable Receipt

[Our Newspaper] The Stock Exchange has set the trading unit for Taiwan Sugar Corporation shares at 10 shares. The face value of the company's shares circulating in the market is mostly more than 10 shares, and the delivery is very difficult. The Stock Exchange has obtained the company's consent to temporarily issue dividable receipts for shares with a face value of more than 10 shares at the time of delivery. After the original shares are exchanged for small-value shares from the company, a notice will be issued to exchange the shares based on the receipt.

Wing On Textile Mill to Launch Dividend

[Our Newspaper] The board of directors of Wing On Textile Company recently resolved to launch the 1948 dividend on the 14th of this month, calculated as 1 Fen weekly interest, which is converted into gold yuan at the legal currency according to the amount of capital stock. In addition, cotton yarn gifts will be distributed, and the value of the cotton yarn gifts that should be obtained will be estimated according to the market price of cotton yarn on the 14th and calculated for distribution. However, no matter when the shareholders receive the gifts in the future, the estimated price will be taken as the standard, and it will not change due to the rise or fall of the yarn price.

Also, the Stock Exchange made a special announcement in the market yesterday that the company's shares will be traded without interest and without rights from the 12th of this month.

### Serious Fuel Problem

The entire fuel problem in this city is facing a serious stage. Not only is the reserve becoming scarce, but the source has not yet improved. The market price has not shown any signs of declining. The price of coal balls has also been increased for the fifth time since the beginning of the year due to the high cost of raw materials and insufficient cost, soaring from 4,200 yuan per load to 7,000 yuan. According to relevant sources, the responsible authorities have repeatedly made efforts to purchase, or even discussed reducing the use of fuel, but the situation in various coal-producing areas is complicated, or damaged by war, and it is impossible to ship goods for a while. In addition, transportation is difficult, so the sources from all roads have not been restored as expected.

### National Bank Purchases US Dollars, Improves Redemption Methods

Although the Central Bank raises the listed price every day for purchasing US dollars, the number of people who exchange is very small because the listed price is still far from the market price. Now, in order to take care of the actual situation, the bank has temporarily stopped listing prices and changed the purchase method. It has entrusted the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to purchase US dollars based on the foreign exchange transfer certificate price of the previous day. The purchase price yesterday was 3,700 yuan per US dollar.

### Tea Market Apparently Flat but Secretly Rising

Yesterday, the tea market continued to show a solid trend in the calm. Because it was the weekend, and after the arrival of various colors from Wutun and other places ceased, and although goods from Zhejiang and other places are arriving in Shanghai, the inventory of old tea is empty, and the new season is still quite a distance away. Holders are single-mindedly holding on to sales and do not allow easy disposal. Therefore, it is difficult for buyers to be satisfied, and the transaction is therefore strangely sluggish, and the process is said to be gradually increasing. In terms of prices, due to the relationship between the goods, there has not been significant progress, and all say that they are apparently flat but secretly rising.

### Silk Soars

The man-made silk market yesterday rose with interest. The city's money market loosened, and the secret interest rate within the industry was 60 yuan to 65 yuan. When the market opened in the morning, the gold trend outside the market was still flat, and it weakened after opening, so people's hearts were still calm.

The opening price of No. 120 Tianqiao Monday's head office was 1,060,000 to 1,070,000. The trend was stable after opening, hovering around 1,100,000. After hearing that the gold market price had risen and the yarn outside the industry had risen around 11:00, people's hearts turned strong, and the market trend rose in a straight line, rising to 1,220,000 at noon. In the afternoon, because there was no market inside the company on Saturday, the gold price outside the market rose sharply, and the market trend was still strong, and the asking price was crazy, but there were no formal transactions.

Yesterday, the raw silk market was not glorious in the foreign exchange market, and people's hearts were still calm when it first opened. The first offer of the top-grade retail market was 1,350,000 yuan. The intermediate trend was still stable. Afterwards, the gold price outside the industry rose, and the cotton yarn rose sharply. This street's desire to purchase increased, people's hearts tended to be flattered, and the market situation was extremely strong, rising to 1,520,000 at noon. In the afternoon, because gold rose sharply again, the market trend followed suit, and the asking price was about 200,000 yuan again.

The trend of the silk satin market yesterday fluctuated. From the morning opening to the closing of the market, the range of rise and fall was still close, and the market trend was still flat. Meiya quilt was initially sold for 670,000 yuan. In the middle of the process, because the secret interest rate was still high, scattered households released their goods to release interest, and the supply on the market was still strong, and the market trend weakened slightly. Once it recovered a small 5,000 yuan, people's hearts suddenly became strong after hearing that many Chinese stocks had risen to the limit and gold was approaching 220,000, and the contribution on the market was strong, and the asking price was high, closing near noon at 685,000 yuan, continuing to rise by more than 20,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the sharp rise in gold prices in raw silk and man-made silk also affected people's hearts, and Meiya shouted to sell at 740,000 to 750,000.

### Food Grains Soar, Especially the First-Class Rice Creates a New Price of 24,600, Flour, Food Oil, and Other Market Prices Jump Consistently

The rise in food grains is flying high, because yesterday was Saturday, and the payment was separated by two days with very high interest, so the cargo owners also raised the price, and the hearts of the people were tight, and there were many households entering the market. The price of white rice in the North Market was as high as 23,400 yuan, a sharp increase of 3,700 yuan, and the price of special high-quality rice was 24,600 yuan, a sharp increase of 20%. The rise in the South Market was slower, with white rice at 22,200 yuan, an increase of about 2,700 to 3,000 yuan. The total number of registered arrivals in the two markets was 6,408 stones. The market trend suddenly took off, because of the Monday payment relationship, the cargo owners held on strongly, and the price of rice also soared. The old car broke the 10,000 yuan mark at the opening of the market, and reached 10,600 yuan at the closing of the market. The initial price of the soldiers' ship was a sharp increase of more than 1,000 yuan. Large households in the central market strongly absorbed it, and once hit the 10,000 yuan mark, and the closing price was slightly lower, trading at 9,980 yuan. After the closing of the market, scattered households were active, and the market trend hit the 10,000 yuan mark again, making a high price of 10,000 yuan, and the asking price in the after-market was 10,300 yuan. The bran broker strongly absorbed it, and it rose sharply by 15%, with large packages reaching a peak of 7,800 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

Launched rising prices, soybeans with oil cake rose sharply, and the factory interest was particularly strong. Han Kou car beans rose sharply by 4,000 yuan, reaching a high of 21,500 yuan, and winter beans and Mulberry Garden beans generally rose by 20%. The rise in raw peanuts was more moderate. Yangzhou raw peanuts reached a height of 10%, hitting 20,000 yuan yesterday. The sales of corn and red sorghum were limited, and the increase was not much.

Edible Oil

The rising trend is like wildfire, initially because rice prices rose, people's hearts were strong, and cargo owners strongly held on to the price, and the price increased by 10,000 yuan. Later, the buying interest was even stronger, and the price rose again sharply. Soybean oil finally rose by 18,000 yuan, reaching a high of 94,000 yuan, vegetable oil was 90,000 yuan, and good barrel raw oil exceeded the 100,000 yuan mark, and finally even reached 110,000 yuan (Qingdao), a sharp increase of 20,000 yuan, and soybean cake also increased by 20%.

### Tung Oil Asks for High Prices

The tung oil market yesterday showed a trend that was full of momentum after the market opened because people's hearts were strong and the trend was full of momentum. In an instant, it was also heard that financial items and items outside the industry all reached a peak. Holders also followed suit and shouted high prices, causing the rising trend to be out of control. Until the market closed, they continued to rise by 2,000 to 5,000 yuan uniformly, and the bottom was very solid, and the future was optimistic.

### Central Trust Bureau Actively Promotes Trade with the Sterling Area

Organizing a Review Committee to Be Responsible for All Approvals

To promote trade with countries in the Sterling Area, the government, with the approval of the Executive Yuan, is gradually implementing measures. The Central Trust Bureau (CTB) was instructed to convene meetings with relevant agencies, including the Ministries of Industry and Commerce, Foreign Affairs, Finance, the National Resources Commission, the Central Bank, and the Export-Import Control Board, to discuss trade issues with Sterling Area countries. Decisions were made regarding trade partners, goods, and trade volumes. The initial phase is tentatively set at 500,000 pounds, with pilot programs in countries such as the UK, Australia, India, Pakistan, New Zealand, the Malay Archipelago, the Dutch East Indies, and Burma. Exported goods will include cotton yarn, raw silk, tea, and hog bristles. Imported goods will include rice, wheat, cotton, wool, rubber, burlap sacks, machinery, and fertilizers. According to Deng Fei, the manager of the CTB's Barter Trade Department, the bureau is actively working on trade matters with Sterling Area countries. The Chinese side has already compiled a list of export and import goods, and the Ministries of Industry and Commerce and Foreign Affairs are exchanging opinions with Sterling Area countries. If an agreement is reached, contracts will be signed, and formal transactions will begin. The CTB is handling this matter on behalf of the government and is proceeding according to instructions from above. It is understood that this trade will still be conducted through barter. The CTB has drafted eleven measures and, based on factual needs, will establish a Sterling Area Barter Trade Review Committee. This committee will consist of the CTB Director-General, Deputy Director-General, relevant department heads, and representatives from the Ministries of Finance, Industry and Commerce, Foreign Affairs, the Export-Import Control Board, the National Resources Commission, the Central Bank, the National Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the Shanghai Import-Export Association. The Director-General will serve as the convener. The Review Committee will be responsible for reviewing and approving all aspects of barter trade, including target countries, trade limits, and the types and prices of goods for import and export. Furthermore, to secure export trade goods, the CTB will, as needed, purchase them in advance from concentrated production areas or cooperate with reputable manufacturers in various regions for procurement and production. Imported goods will be sold on the market at any time under the overall plan of the Government Materials Allocation Committee. Any profits or losses incurred from barter trade will be remitted to the national treasury. The CTB will estimate the amount of funds needed for purchasing export goods and importing goods and will submit this amount to the Executive Yuan for approval. After approval, the CTB will open an account at the Central Bank specifically for the cost of purchasing export goods and importing goods from Sterling Area countries, which the CTB can then use as needed.

### Commercial Briefs

According to the Export-Import Control Board, the export price limit for the coming week (March 7th to 13th) will remain the same as last week, with no changes.

The trade in furs and wool is being held back. Today, foreign firms like New Sheng are experiencing sluggish trading because overseas telegram replies have not yet arrived. However, those holding the goods are reluctant to sell at lower prices due to rising prices of other goods outside the industry.

### A Stroll Through the Market: Observing the Taiwanese Visitors

An Afternoon Hurricane Sends the Whole City into a Frenzy: The Nanyang Region First Uses the Windfall Silver Dollars as a First Strike

Since the issuance of the large denomination banknotes, there has been a universal expectation of appreciation. Financial authorities are releasing foreign exchange transfer certificates and are willing to raise interest rates to tighten the money supply, which has created the current abnormal psychology in the market.

Over the past few days, prices have risen daily. However, while sellers feel that the selling price is low, they also feel that earning interest on the proceeds provides some compensation. Buyers, while feeling that it is not as good as earning interest, do not mind the purchase price and feel that it will be cheaper in the long run.

Both buyers and sellers are uneasy in this contradictory state of mind. As a result, the market atmosphere has reversed from the excitement of the previous days and has become sluggish.

Yesterday, besides the stock market, which was almost completely up, other markets remained stagnant. However, around 3:00 PM, a sudden surge occurred, with gold certificates and silver dollars leading the way with sharp rises. The market prices of general commodities also increased successively, but no one knew where the price increases came from.

There are indeed military rumors circulating in the market, but they seem unlikely to be true. After checking foreign news, it became clear that this price surge originated in Hong Kong and is related to the financial war situation between Britain and the United States that we have been discussing for days.

The United States opposes South Africa's price increase in gold sales and is taking various active measures. In its sphere of influence, it is implementing controls in places where gold imports and exports have not yet been restricted.

The Philippines was originally a free port for gold imports and exports. Many of the bills here come from Hong Kong, and many of the Hong Kong bills come from the Philippines. The Philippines gets its gold from Australia, South America and elsewhere. The Philippine government suddenly ordered the management of gold trade from the day before yesterday. Henceforth, the import and export of gold in the Philippines must be approved by the government.

This action was apparently orchestrated by the United States, with two possible intentions: (1) To prevent the outflow of gold reserves within the US sphere of influence due to rising gold prices in various parts of Europe, which would affect the US's position as the world's largest holder of gold. (2) The United States may be considering raising gold prices and must therefore control exports in advance to reduce losses. The news of the Philippine government's control of gold trade reached Hong Kong, and the price of gold in Hong Kong immediately surged from 304 yuan to more than 307 yuan yesterday morning.

Another reason is that the United States explicitly rejected China's request for a silver loan. This news was published in the early newspapers. The stock market is the most sensitive and knows that with the disappointment of the silver loan, the hope of a turnaround for the gold yuan and finance is even slimmer. Therefore, the prices of sixteen stocks were pushed to the limit, which then spread to the whole city. Of course, the Yuan Toutou (silver dollar) was the first to be affected, but the news of the silver dollar speculators is still slow, and their knowledge is still shallow. Therefore, the price surge was still led by gold certificates, but looking ahead to next week, if there are any special changes, the Yuan Toutou may still have a new performance, which is not yet known.

### Yarn Prices Rise Sharply; Cotton Cloth Remains Firm

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw an even greater rise in prices. With the money supply easing, people's minds are unsettled, and the atmosphere of speculation is strong. All parties flocked to purchase, and the prices of various yarns reached new highs.

42-count Blue Phoenix yarn opened at 1.47 million yuan and eventually rose to 1.54 million yuan, a sharp increase of 300,000 yuan. 40-count Jin Cheng yarn jumped 230,000 yuan to close at 1.5 million yuan. 32-count Silver Moon yarn broke through the 1 million yuan mark to reach 1.14 million yuan, a sharp increase of 230,000 yuan.

11-count Double Horse spot yarn jumped directly from 710,000 yuan to stand firm at the 900,000 yuan mark, ending at 200,500 yuan higher. Factory orders appeared at 840,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse created a new peak of 130,000 yuan. Other yarns such as Jin Cheng and Tian Nu were opening between 100,000 yuan and 850,000 yuan. 16-count Guang Ming yarn approached 800,000 yuan and ended at 770,000 yuan.

The cloth market was prosperous. In the morning, sales in the local streets were smooth, so the market opened high. Many people needed to sell their positions before closing, so the market saw a slight decline. In the afternoon, when news of sharp increases in black and red cloth came, people's hearts were greatly encouraged. Buying was very strong outside the market, and the market once again saw a sharp rise.

Nengtou fine cloth rose from 31,500 yuan to a high of 32,000 yuan. Due to many short sales before closing, the price dropped circuitously and closed at 31,000 yuan, a net increase of 2,200 yuan. In the afternoon, transactions were made at 37,500 yuan.

Si Junzi Yuan serge initially traded from 29,500 yuan and slowly fell to 28,400 yuan, eventually closing at 29,100 yuan, a net increase of 1,900 yuan. In the afternoon, the initial asking price was 31,500 yuan, reaching a high of 36,500 yuan, before gradually retreating to 35,000 yuan. 190 high-grade shilin (dye) hit the 70,000 yuan mark, and colored and printed fabrics also saw new highs.

### Woolen Fabric Spring Sales Launched

Yesterday's wholesale market for woolens and serge saw increased activity. Many businesses were asking the CTB and the China Textile Corporation for goods, and brokers were busy running around. This is because Western suit and fashion shops and woolen and foreign goods stores in various districts have all launched spring sales. Custom-made suits costing more than 100,000 yuan and pieces of material costing more than 50,000 yuan are being ordered and sold. At the same time, people's minds in Nanjing have become more at ease, sales have progressed, and many businesses have added goods and reopened. The prices of woolen goods are quite firm, and people in the industry are unanimously optimistic.

### Joe Louis' Autobiography (3)

— Translated by Cang Long

After my first professional boxing match, I earned a net of fifty-two dollars. This was still an undercard fight. In six months of professional fighting, I won ten fights by knockout and two fights by points decision. Gradually, my weight also increased. By the time I fought Burkeham in 1935, my weight had increased to one hundred and ninety-four pounds. After my second defeat of Lame Li, my name and picture appeared in all the newspapers. They gave me the title "Brown Bomber." Many boxing promoters came to contact me, but the conditions were all vague. As a result, I signed a contract with Uncle Mike. This was the prelude to my beginning to make big money. In my fight against Lai Hanluo, I earned a net of twelve thousand dollars at once. At that time, it had only been ten months since I turned professional. And most boxers have to fight for years before they can barely earn ten thousand dollars in one fight. At this time, it was only one month away from my twenty-first birthday. During Easter of that year, I bought a total of one or two houses for my mother and sisters.

In 1935, I went to Yankee Stadium in New York to fight former heavyweight champion Canara. Many people hoped that I would lose. When I arrived at the stadium, the flashing lights of many cameras almost blinded my eyes. Reporters asked many questions, and I could only answer a very small part of them. Some people said that I looked very unhappy. This was not the case. Such a scene was too big and superfluous for a newcomer.

Many newspapers said that when I was rising to prominence and when I won the championship, I was surrounded by scalpers. And they constantly made unfounded accusations against my manager and coach. However, my manager and coach never taught me to give up any battle. I think they were indeed doing their job practically. At the same time, among the people around me, I did have people I could trust. For example, Gong Shi, who was in charge of ticketing, was a determined accountant. My legal advisor, Jebsen, was the civilian aide to the Secretary of the Army. These people all had high reputations, and they managed all my affairs.

When we were ready for the fight against Canara, many gangsters in New York wanted to open a "knife" to us. Some people may have accepted it, but we hired our own police and pushed these people out the door. The night of the fight against Canara on June 25 was truly the most clearly remembered night of all my battles. That night, I was all normal. Canara wanted to scare me off with his physique. In the fourth round, when we were wrestling together, he tried to use his weight to attack me, but I made a move before him and threw him open very clearly. At that time, I only saw his jaw drooping and a strange expression on his face, because no one had ever thrown him like this before. Before he could close his mouth, I punched him in the head again, and his eyes suddenly became bright. In the sixth round, I hit him in the jaw again, and he fell to the ground. Although he stood up slowly and staggeringly, he could not withstand a hook with his left hand and a punch with his right hand directly to the brain, and he fell again. This time, he could no longer climb up. As a result of that bloody battle, I earned a net of sixty thousand dollars!

After this, they found Baer to fight me again. At this time, Baer's heavyweight championship had only recently been taken away by Braddock. Hours before the opening of the fight against Baer, I married a stenographer from Chicago named Maff. Maff watched me defeat Baer that night. (Note: Joe Louis and Maff have now divorced for the second time).

However, bad luck came. In June 1936, in the first fight against Schmelling at Yankee Stadium in New York, he defeated me. He almost canceled all the achievements I had already made in the boxing world! At that time, I was not yet twenty-two years old. I think this was the worst night I had ever experienced. This is something I want to forget the most! Beforehand, I had expected to win this battle easily, but things did not go as planned. Schmelling's right-hand killer punch almost shattered my jaw, and I fell to the ground at once. His few hard punches from the right often hit my face, beating my face bloody, and later even my vision was blurred. This was the only time I had encountered this in all my battles, but he kept fighting me until the twelfth round before he finally solved me.

In August and September of the same year, I defeated Shaw and Aito one after another. However, reporters still thought that Schmelling had completely defeated me, but they were wrong. I have sufficient battlefield experience to estimate the intentions of each opponent, and I still have full confidence. At that time, my manager wanted to arrange a second fight with Schmelling, but Xu refused. Finally, Uncle Mike came up with the idea to agree to fight Braddock, who was the world heavyweight champion at that time. The date of that decisive battle was set for June 20, 1937.

Braddock was really a killer, hitting hard punches. The length of time he fought me exceeded my expectations. I had planned to solve him in the fifth round, but the sixth and seventh rounds continued until the eighth round, when his arms and legs completely lost control. I used all my strength to swing a solid punch, hitting his right face, and he immediately fell face down in response. This time I won the world heavyweight boxing championship!

When I was actively training to prepare for the second battle against Schmelling, I vaguely heard Schmelling say to others: Germans are a superior race, and he will prove this in boxing. On the night of the decisive battle with Schmelling, I was fully prepared. As soon as my left hand punched, my right hand followed closely and hit his jaw. He was exhausted to parry, and I used all my skills to punch him to the rope circle on the edge of the field. His knees bent down, and I grabbed him away from the rope circle with one hand and punched him in the belly again. He screamed, and I thought to myself: "How is it, self-proclaimed superior species!" Then I repeatedly hit various key points on his body and jaw. He fell for the first time and soon got up, but he could not withstand a hook with my left fist and a swing with my right fist, and he fell again. As soon as he climbed off the ground, a fatal blow from my fist hit his chin, and he could no longer climb up this time. However, Schmelling later said in Germany that the reason he was defeated was because I had committed a foul. This is another reason why I hate Schmelling. The filmed movies clearly proved that I did not commit a foul, but these movies were never shown in Germany.

### Wong Peng Soon to Fight Phil Fietman in the All-England Badminton Men's Singles Final; Wong Bing Soon Loses After a Valiant Fight in the Semi-Finals

[Our Correspondent] London, 4th: Malayan champion Wong Peng Soon, having crushed American player Love Tate 15-6, 15-5, will face Phil Fietman, undefeated for ten years, in the final to determine the champion.

Wong Bing Soon, whose arm injury has not yet healed, was defeated by Phil Fietman in the semi-final. The score was 15-2, 15-4. However, the match was very exciting and intense, not as one-sided as the score suggests. Fietman is agile and accurate in his strokes. The six points he lost were all due to Wong Bing Soon's continuous shell-like high-pressure smashes in front of the net, which were impossible to save.

Wong Peng Soon's outstanding performance forced Love Tate to submit within 26 minutes. The air conditioning inside the venue was cold tonight. The Malayan player, who came from a temperate zone, was significantly affected at the beginning of the match, and was once behind 2-6 in the first game. But after that, he recovered to normal and scored ten points in a row with a barrage of powerful smashes. Love Tate was at a loss.

Upset in Women's Singles; Danish Queen Eliminated

Selangor doubles champions Yang De Cai and Zeng Guan Liang defeated the Danish team of Holm and Johnson 15-8, 15-1 in the semi-finals. Lin Qifang and Wang Baolin also defeated the American team of Stephen and Williams in straight sets.

In another semi-final, Americans Phil Fietman and Rogers easily defeated the Indian team of Mohan Lair and Muvie 15-7, 15-5.

Women's Doubles Enters Final

Defending All-England women's doubles champions Santander and Mrs. Am did not repeat their singles failures and defeated the Anglo-American team of Mrs. Stephen and Mrs. Sanders 15-2, 15-5 to win the right to compete in the finals.

Another team, Svennson and Jaqubsen (Denmark), were defeated by Miss Eupa (England) and Miss Allen (Denmark). The score was 15-8, 15-1. The You-Ya team entered the finals and will compete with the San-An team for the championship.

### Unexpected Outcome in Mayor's Cup Football Tournament: Two-Year Champion Lost Carelessly in Da Jingzhou. Suffering Soldiers, Suffering Generals, China Aviation Beat Qingbai, Yin Qingbing's Final Kick Makes the Whole Situation Look Completely Different.

[Our Correspondent] In the Mayor's Cup football replay, a major upset occurred yesterday, and Qingbai, who had no problem winning the championship, was eliminated by China Aviation by two to one. China Aviation won the final spot. Qingbai had won the Mayor's Cup for two consecutive sessions, and the victory of this third session was interrupted. The silver cup changed hands, which was beyond the expectations of more than a thousand fans. In the first half, China Aviation took the lead with a score of one to zero. After Gao Xiuqing scored the first goal for China Aviation in the first ten minutes, Qingbai counterattacked, but to no avail. In the second half, Qingri was determined to fight to the death, and although the offensive was strong, it could not find the door. Nearly a thousand fans were already worried about Qingbai until the last ten minutes, when Jin Lusheng hit a goal and tied the score. At this time, the audience thought that the result would be a tie and overtime, but unexpectedly, in the last two minutes, Yin Qingbing of China Aviation charged, and Qingbai's goal was broken again. The two-year champion was tragically defeated.

Qingbai's defeat was due to underestimating the enemy in the first half. They thought they could win, and when the situation was dull, they were already unable to do anything and became more and more depressed. The team lost abnormally, and they were all listless and unusually relaxed. The defense was too poor, the defense line was wide open, the central defense line was like a decoration, and the forwards and defenders were cut into two sections. The forwards were not as good, and the shots and headers did not show any color. There were as many as fourteen or five corner kicks, but none of them bloomed. On the other hand, China Aviation fought hard as a team that was bound to lose, which is where the victory lies. Although there is luck and misfortune, it also depends on your own efforts.

Referee Ni Xiaoben blew the whistle to start the game. The China Aviation grieving team fought, and Gao Xiuqing and Yin Qingbing attacked together. Yin dribbled the ball straight into the hinterland and passed it to Xiao Gao, who shot low into the net near the goal, taking the lead with a score of one to zero. Qingbai was caught off guard by this loss and tried to counterattack. Liu Tiyin forced a low shot, which was caught by Xu Fusheng, and Liu Longxing's header also went out. At the thirty-third minute, Xiao Luo turned around and shot from 20 yards, hitting the post and bouncing off, hitting Xu Fusheng's shoulder. Xu lightly stretched his arm and caught it. China Aviation won the first half by one goal.

After changing sides, Qingbai worked harder, and Xiao Gu, Liu Longxing, and Liu Tiyin exchanged positions, but it was still to no avail. China Aviation put up a strong defense, and Qingbai's forwards did not bring their shooting shoes, so they stopped at this point. The two sides fought for a long time until the thirty-third minute, when Sanmao dribbled the ball far out and passed it to the left. Fu Naitang passed it to Xiao Luo, and the ball bounced back from the post. Jin Lusheng shot hard into the net near the goal and tied the score. One minute before the end of the game, Xiao Gao passed to Yin Qingbing, who went straight in along the side, passed the Sanmao pass, and shot into the bottom of the net. China Aviation then relied on this goal to fortunately eliminate the old champion Qingbai.

### Post-Match Comments

In this Mayor's Cup, upsets have been repeated, with Longtou being eliminated by Zhichao first, and Qingbai being poisoned by China Aviation later, which are interesting to each other.

The Yiyuan field is extremely empty, and nearly a thousand spectators dotted it, making it even more deserted and miserable.

China Aviation fought with a grieving team, not seeking victory, but seeking to lose less. As a result, they unexpectedly tasted a sweet cup. There is a relationship between the team's luck. Xu Fusheng performed unexpectedly brilliantly, Gao Xiuqing returned to command the three armies, and Chen Jiaoping's help was also beneficial.

Qingbai gave one of the worst performances of the season. The forwards forgot to bring their shooting shoes, and each player was out of sync. Xiao Luo was nailed by Chen Jiaoping, and Jin Lusheng was not as accurate as usual. Since Afu retired and Xiao Fei went to Hong Kong, the strength of the forwards has been greatly reduced. Liu Tiyin, as a winger, likes to dribble a lot, and Xiao Gu has no cross-kick, so there is a sigh of talent on the right wing.

If there is another upset in today's battle between the Railway and Zhichao, and China Aviation and Zhichao win the Mayor's Cup, it will be a real upset among upsets.

The level of football is declining. Yesterday's game was muddy and watery, without any highlights. The audience did not move forward. To be fair, it was like a junior cup game.

The Football Committee took over the ball game after the victory, and the results of the first session were not bad. Since then, it has been getting worse and worse. Is it that after the extreme of splendor, it returns to plainness?

Except for Meng Yiliang, the rest of Qingbai are all young players, just like the incarnation of the previous Qingbai. It seems that A-Gui still needs to work harder.

Sanmao's performance was not weak, and he sat in the defense, like the natural moat of the Yangtze River, but the last goal he was responsible for could not be cancelled before. It was a flaw in the ball. (Mr. Shi)

Team Li's light yellow jerseys further highlighted the striking beauty. Zhang Luoluo of St. John's had a smiling attitude when she shook hands with the opponent as a substitute, which gave people a sense of lightness, and can also be said to be an expression of "courtesy before soldiers." In the first quarter, Team Li led 14-6. Team Li's three forwards were petite and exquisite, making the defenders dizzy. The first half ended 26-17. The Qian sisters, Chuping and Youping, scored more points as their pigtails swung more fiercely. Lin Jingyi of St. John's showed fighting spirit in the second and third quarters.

### The Chalk Life

— Lin Xi

When it comes to teaching, people always praise it as "noble." But we teachers feel that it is not because of nobility that we do this work. Honestly, "nobility" is just empty words, what is it worth? I think that if a person can willingly do a job and does not want to leave, the reason can generally be divided into two categories: one is because of interest, and the other is because of fame and fortune. Then, naturally, someone will ask: Is there any interest or fame and fortune to be gained from teaching? Covered in chalk dust, hoarse, day after day, year after year, in the end, you can't get an official position or earn a penny. What interest is there in this profession?

This is really not easy to answer in one sentence, so let me start from afar.

An individual is born with all mental activities demanding two aspects: receiving and giving. As people read books and come into contact with many ideas and problems, these things gradually mix, change, ferment, and grow inside you. You feel as if some things are always rushing out of you. You feel the need for people to know, sympathize, debate, or even oppose. In short, you are looking forward to a kind of outward venting.

We usually don't realize it, but in fact, people are more or less looking forward to a kind of venting. Some people are willing to lose money to run a magazine, some people submit articles everywhere, and some people are willing to sacrifice their lives in order to fight for the right to say what they want to say to others (called freedom of speech). In the West, there are many people who use various methods to run for a seat as a councilor, just to have an opportunity to stand up and speak, and have thousands of people sit and listen. If someone has been to Hyde Park in London, this situation will be even clearer.

However, none of these paths are more direct, easier, or more thoroughly reliable than teaching. Writing articles is a roundabout thing, and psychologically it is like talking to yourself, making it difficult to have the kind of reaction that makes you believe. Speaking to people often involves the danger of being booed and blushing. Even chatting with friends, I don't know if you have had this unpleasant experience: when you are talking eloquently and happily, you find that two friends have already fallen asleep by the fireplace, and another yawns and says, "Ah, let's talk about something else."

Only on the podium can you say whatever you want, and there are always opportunities. If you have knowledge, you can say it. If you have complaints, you can say it. You can praise a failed hero, or you can scold all the characters of ancient and modern times. Moreover, as long as you pay attention, you can see that under you are those young faces that have not yet lost their purity, with their eyes wide open, looking at you so enthusiastically and respectfully, listening to your every word. Except on the podium, you will never have a second such opportunity. Friends are not so easy to find. The masses will not be so understanding. You feel that the words that are pressing on your heart are constantly flowing outward, and you feel that unspeakable release every moment.

I myself remember once, when I accidentally mentioned a relatively difficult to explain philosophy of life, I saw many deeply thoughtful faces below me. When I accidentally turned my gaze back, I saw a sudden look of understanding and empathy on a face in the front row. At that moment, I felt like I had suddenly found a confidant in the vast sea of people.

To find a place where so many people can listen to you, and always be so attentive, so sympathetic, and so respectful, besides here, the podium, I'm afraid there is no other place. Only here can you fully enjoy this kind of happiness.

At the same time, I also know that I am doing a career that is needed for the survival of mankind. We are really not doing this work because of "nobility." Even if everyone publicly recognizes tomorrow that teaching is the most vulgar profession in the world, I am afraid I would still be willing to spend this chalk life.

### Humorous Collection

— Shi

Hat and Film

Former U.S. Secretary of Labor Perkins told a story. Once, she went to see a movie wearing a hat. Turning around, she apologized to the gentleman sitting behind her and said:

"If my hat is blocking your view, I can take it off."

"No need," the man replied, "your hat is much better than this movie."

Most are Poor

An elementary school Chinese teacher gave the essay topic: "A Poor Family." A daughter of a wealthy merchant handed in her paper, and the first paragraph was:

"Once upon a time, there was a very poor family. The father was very poor, the mother was very poor, their cook was also very poor, the doorman was also very poor, the gardener was also very poor, the coachman was also very poor, everyone was very poor."

### American Dog Consumption

— Binzhi

Cats and dogs are the two most common domestic animals. Westerners prefer dogs to cats. In the United States, an average of 57 out of 100 families own cats or dogs, or both. The total number of dogs kept in the United States is about 20 million.

Americans keep dogs as playthings and feed them very well. Therefore, the annual consumption of those 20 million dogs is also a very large number. Just in terms of food, last year's consumption reached 120 million US dollars. The total estimated consumption on dogs is about 7.5 billion US dollars per year.

Since dog consumption is so considerable, many businessmen have also moved their minds to dogs and specialize in selling dog supplies, such as houses, food, medicine, clothing, etc., which are all sold in the market. There are also schools for training dogs, hospitals for treating dog diseases, barbershops for grooming dog hair, etc. It is really thoughtful and meticulous. Fortunately, most of the dog owners are wealthy masters and ladies, and they don't care about spending money, so merchants who specialize in the dog business can easily make ten times the profit.

Ten years ago, someone launched "Dog Week," and since then there has been an annual season dedicated to dogs. In the beginning, only 500 groups participated, but last year it had increased to 3,000. There is also a dog-raising manual published, which is now in its fourth edition, with 5,000 copies per edition. In two months, 20,000 books were sold out. Starting last year, a dog's "Nobel Prize" was also established, with a prize of 2,000 US dollars, awarded to the person who has made the most contributions to the health and welfare of dogs in a year.

There are also many dog cemeteries in various places. In general, dog owners not only take great care of their beloved dogs during their lifetime, but also cannot bear to expose their remains after they pass away, and spend a lot of money to find a resting place for them. In Long Island, New York, there is a dog cemetery with more than 5,000 graves, each with a marble monument. The most elaborate one buries a dog called "Pamala Lin," and the grave is worth more than 1,000 US dollars.

It is better to be a dog in peaceful times than a person in troubled times. Seeing the abundance and luxury of American dogs, and then looking at the pitiful appearance of those beggars and women on the streets of our country, it really makes one feel that people are not as good as dogs.

### One-Handed Man

As soon as I entered the elevator, I noticed that the elevator operator only had one hand. His left hand was cut off from the wrist. I asked him if this was very inconvenient. He replied, "Not really, I'm used to it. I only think about it when I'm trying to thread a needle."

Obviously, it is not just the environment that makes people happy or sad. Our emotions are determined by our reactions to the environment. Everyone can overcome misfortune and adversity - if we must overcome, or we will perish. We ourselves may not believe it sometimes, but everyone has unlimited potential to overcome difficulties. We are actually stronger than we imagine, as long as we can persevere and unleash our potential.

The late novelist Booth Tarkington believed that he could endure anything except blindness. At the age of sixty, he unfortunately gradually lost his sight.

When he could no longer see anything with his eyes, Tarkington said: "I found that I could also endure blindness, just as other people endure other things. Even if I lost all my senses, I knew that I could still live in my own mind."

Random Notes from the Film Industry

### American and British Films

— Wang Ce

Shanghai audiences are often immersed in the romances and erotic song and dances of Hollywood male and female stars. They rarely have healthy and energetic works. Even "For Whom the Bell Tolls," which is admired by young men and women in Shanghai, Hollywood screenwriters have obliterated the significance of the Spanish Revolutionary War and cast an American-style love net on the anti-fascist flames of war in Spain. Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman's "intense and moving" and the American university professor's "courage and integrity" can indeed "capture people's hearts," but putting the focus of the Spanish Revolution on American-style individual heroism roughly reveals the purpose of Hollywood.

British films, on the other hand, have recently been relatively able to grasp a correct theme and write out the shape of this social development. For example, the neglected "The Way Ahead" writes about a worker who has devoted his life to the labor movement. He is very popular with the people, but when he leaves the people and accepts the position of Minister of Labor in the court, he is abandoned by the people. The contrast in the whole film is very strong and the meaning is very profound. If British films can grasp the film production policy, they can win over the audience of Hollywood films.

It's not that Hollywood doesn't have good films, but that's exactly it: "As rare as morning stars, can be counted one by one."

A neurotic came to see the doctor and insisted that he had swallowed a horse and had to have surgery to avoid danger. Explanation was ineffective, so the doctor had to listen with a stethoscope for a while, and said that there was indeed a horse inside, and decided to operate.

The patient was carried into the operating room, used general anesthesia, and when he woke up, a large white horse had been placed next to him. The doctor pointed it out to him.

"That's not right," the patient shook his head, "I swallowed a black horse."

### Old Stories of Shanghai, Part Two: The First Vegetable Market in Shanghai

— Gu Qi

Today's Shanghai has decent-sized vegetable markets everywhere. But fifty years ago, there was no such thing as a designated vegetable market. Each street and alley had scattered vegetable trading. As for the wholesale place for hawkers, it was in Pentang Lane, Shanxi Road. There was no construction of a market place there. Only stalls were set up on both sides of the street, somewhat similar to the current vegetable market on Henan Road and Ningbo Road every afternoon. At that time, the old patrol house on Simalu was still in the place of the silk industry guild in front of Pentang Lane. Vegetable vendors were often arrested by the patrol masters of the concession era and taken into the "line" due to lack of licenses or insufficient "tribute", beaten and kicked, and their vegetables were also confiscated, suffering unspeakable hardships. And if they encountered wind, snow, or heavy rain, it was inconvenient for both buyers and sellers to trade in the open air, and there was nothing they could do. At that time, a merchant named Yang Zijing saw this situation and wanted to improve it, so he spent money to build a thatched vegetable market in Wufu Lane, which could slightly shelter from the wind and rain. Vegetable vendors gathered there to trade. At that time, people called it the Donghuang Market Vegetable Market. Later, the market gradually prospered, and the population of Shanghai gradually increased. The Public Works Department decided to build another large-scale vegetable market, so it bought the land in front of the Ten Small Vegetable Market in Yang Zijing's former iron house, and built a large-scale vegetable market made of wooden boards, charging one yuan per month for each stall. Later, because the wooden boards were easily eroded by wind and rain, they were changed to iron sheets, and the stall fees were increased to two to three yuan. In the ten years of the Republic of China, the base of the small vegetable market in the iron house was sold, and it was moved to the Fuzhou Road vegetable market. To this day, the Fuzhou Road vegetable market is still the birthplace of wholesale prices.

Speaking of the vegetable market in the Pentang Lane era, prices were still in cash. Yesterday, I accidentally flipped through an old newspaper from fifty years ago and saw the vegetable prices at that time, and I just randomly copied a few: firewood fifty cash per hundred catties, soybean oil thirty-six cash per catty, sesame cakes three cash for two, eggs four cash each, meat fifty-six cash per catty, fish twenty cash each, coarse cloth three hundred cash per bolt.

Today, eggs are nearly a hundred gold yuan each. A hundred gold yuan is equivalent to 300 million legal tender, which is equivalent to more than 900 billion cash. Such a calculation is truly like a world away.
