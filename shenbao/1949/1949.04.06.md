### Peace Talks Delegates Meet in Beiping; Agreement Reached on Ceasing Military Offensives; Formal Ceasefire Order Said to Be Issued Soon

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] The formal negotiations between the government and the Communist Party's peace delegations commenced on the 5th in Beiping. Various circles in the capital eagerly anticipate the Communist Party's order to cease military offensives. On the evening of the 5th, a rumor briefly spread that the Communist Party had issued a ceasefire broadcast. This excessive hope was apparently based on the precedent of negotiating after a ceasefire during the previous Political Consultative Conference (PCC) era. However, as of midnight on the 5th, the Communist Party had not made such a broadcast. Authoritative sources stated that an agreement had indeed been reached on ceasing military offensives. The order to notify frontline troops is pending issuance by the Communist Party. Since government forces have long ceased offensive operations, the war can be immediately stopped once the Communist Party issues this order.

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] The peace talks convened in Beiping on the 5th for the entire day. Government Chief Delegate Zhang Zhizhong telephoned from Beiping on the evening of the 5th to report the progress and results of the day's meeting to the Acting President and Premier He, and to engage in brief discussions.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 5th] A dispatch from Zhenjiang reports that the Communist army is beginning a general retreat on the north bank of the Yangtze River, and that hostilities have also ceased in the Anqing area. Although neither the Communist Party nor the government has issued a ceasefire order, authoritative sources confirm that both sides have ordered their troops along the Yangtze River to cease operations. Local newspapers report that the chief delegates of both sides, Zhou Enlai and Zhang Zhizhong, have telegraphed the commanders of their respective armies along the Yangtze River, informing them that peace talks have begun and ordering an immediate cessation of hostilities. A formal ceasefire order is expected to be issued soon. It is reported that the Comprehensive Committee of the peace talks discussed the first item on the agenda this morning. The remaining items have been delegated to various subcommittees for discussion. For example, the punishment of war criminals, the convening of a Political Consultative Conference (PCC), and the abolition of the "puppet constitution" and "puppet legitimacy" have been delegated to the political subcommittee; military reorganization has been delegated to the military subcommittee; land reform and the confiscation of bureaucratic capital have been delegated to the economic subcommittee; and the abolition of unequal treaties has been delegated to the foreign affairs subcommittee. It is claimed that after achieving its objective of securing a ceasefire, the government's peace delegation has further requested a cessation of propaganda warfare, and that all published and broadcast materials be submitted to the entire peace talks conference for review.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 5th] According to a source close to Acting President Li, the origin of the rumors of the Communist Party's agreement to a ceasefire is unknown. The source stated that the official report from the government's peace delegation received on the morning of the 5th has not yet mentioned a ceasefire agreement.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 5th] According to reliable sources, when the government's peace delegation arrived in Beiping and held preliminary discussions with the Communist Party's delegates, the Communist Party initially refused to negotiate with Zhang Zhizhong on the grounds that he had visited Xikou to meet Chiang Kai-shek before his departure, nearly causing the peace talks to collapse. Fortunately, Shao Lizi's explanation salvaged the situation. Zhou Enlai believed that Zhang Zhizhong's visit to Xikou was to receive instructions from Chiang Kai-shek, whom the Communist Party considered the number one war criminal, and therefore refused to negotiate with him. Shao Lizi explained that Zhang Zhizhong's visit to Xikou was merely a courtesy call and not to receive instructions. The Communist Party's attitude then softened.

### Zhang Yaoming Attends Executive Yuan Meeting to Report on the "April 1st Incident"

[Li Bao, Nanjing, 5th] At the political affairs meeting on the morning of the 5th, Capital Garrison Commander Zhang Yaoming was ordered to attend and report on the "April 1st Incident." Zhang stated that the Garrison Command had received intelligence about the student parade in advance and had immediately consulted with the Ministry of Education and the authorities of various schools, hoping that students would not stage parades or petitions during this period of martial law. At the same time, he sought instructions from above, and was instructed to persuade and guide them. If they did not listen, they should be allowed to parade, but must be protected along the way and attention paid to maintaining order. Therefore, no accidents occurred during the student parade and petition in the morning. Zhang then emphasized that the incident was entirely accidental. The conflict began after the parade was dispersed, when a group of students actively expanded the situation to the vicinity of the Corps headquarters. Zhang did not provide details on the suppression and aftermath. His report lasted for one hour.

### "April 1st" Conflict Incident Increases Difficulties for Peace Talks

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] The Communist Party is paying close attention to the "April 1st" conflict incident between students and officers of the Garrison Command in the capital. They inquired with Zhang Zhizhong of the government's peace delegation. Zhang telephoned the Acting President on the 4th, hoping to inform Beiping of the facts of the incident. It is learned that government officials told reporters on the evening of the 5th that the "April 1st" incident has increased the difficulties for the government's delegates in Beiping.

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] Following Jinling Women's University, Jinling University also resumed classes as usual on the 5th. Central University and National Chengchi University are both on spring break, so the student unrest can be said to have come to an end. The more than one thousand officers and soldiers of the reception corps originally stationed in Daguan New Village will be moved outside the city within days. Among them, military and civil personnel will be discharged, while military personnel will be assigned to various units to continue their service.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The truth of the "April 1st Incident" is being investigated by Wang Shaolun, a specialist commissioner dispatched by the Ministry of Education, in conjunction with Luo Chunbo, director of the political work department of the Capital Garrison Headquarters. The investigation has already begun and the truth will be ascertained and dealt with impartially in the short term. The Garrison Headquarters was recently ordered to move the reception corps outside the city and has begun the transfer in a dramatic manner on the 5th.

It is heard that Liu is scheduled to assume office on the 7th.

### The Proposal to Abolish the Regulations on the Entry of Travelers from Taiwan Provokes Fierce Debate in the Legislative Yuan; Result: Passed to the Internal Affairs and Local Autonomy Committee for Review

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] The proposal to request the Executive Yuan to abolish the regulations on the entry of travelers from Taiwan was debated fiercely in the Legislative Yuan for an entire morning on the 5th, and finally passed for review. Taiwan legislators strongly requested that the regulations be retained, but to no avail. The public announcement by the proposal's co-signatory of withdrawal from the co-signature also triggered emotional arguments. The Legislative Yuan held its 11th meeting of the third session on the morning of the 5th, presided over by Tong Guanxian. After reading the minutes of the previous meeting, the discussion of the proposal began. The proposal was submitted by Lian Mou, Qiu Hanping, and others, with over seventy co-signatories. The reason for the proposal was: "The temporary measures for the entry of military, government personnel and travelers from Taiwan Province violate the Constitution, deprive people of their freedom of residence, movement and action, obstruct transportation, and divide unity. The Executive Yuan should be requested to abolish the measures for the convenience of merchants and travelers." The proposal was raised for discussion at the previous meeting, but it was decided to postpone it to this meeting due to time constraints. After reading the text of the proposal, the announcement that the co-signatories were changing their positions to retain the measures was read. Qiu Hanping, the original proposer, stood up and explained that the regulations in Taiwan Province violate the constitutional provisions on the freedom of movement and residence of the people. He hoped that the members would support the proposal and request the Executive Yuan to abolish it. Yuan Qiju was one of the co-signatories, but Yuan's name was also listed in the withdrawal statement. According to him, after signing the co-signature, he heard from Taiwan legislators that the people of Taiwan were most afraid of two winds: one was the "typhoon" and the other was the "sea breeze." The sea breeze referred to people from the mainland who went to Taiwan to engage in speculative business and wrongdoing. However, from a legal point of view, the original proposal had its own merits. He believed that the measures should be amended and that the proposal should be submitted for review. The co-signatory Zeng Yufa stated that he signed because he wanted it amended. However, after the written statement was published, he found that the amendment had been changed to retention, which lost the original meaning of his signature. He believed that the proposal should be submitted for review. During the review period, he hoped that the Taiwan public opinion organs and the administrative organs would discuss amending the measures. Huang Boshu, a Taiwan legislator, said that although Taiwan was called stable, it was not the paradise people imagined. Taiwan was like a small boat in the ocean, with limited capacity. Food and accommodation were problematic. These measures were the wish of the people of Taiwan. If there were any improprieties in the measures, they could be amended. He hoped that a decision would be made to retain the proposal. Jiang Yiping said, "We love Taiwan, but we don't want Taiwan to violate the law." Taiwan's political and economic difficulties have always been resolved with the police and criminal law. The number of people is related to the current situation. If the peace talks succeed, no one will go to Taiwan. If the peace talks fail, even if tens of millions of people go to Taiwan, it cannot be refused. He believed that the proposal should be submitted for review. Jiang also hoped that the withdrawal of co-signatures after the fact would not be seen again in the future, and that the content, which was originally an amendment, was changed to retention, so he hoped that there would be some correction. Yang Buping also stated that he signed to amend after signing the co-signature, because of the explanation of the Taiwan legislators. But what he signed was an amendment, not retention. Cai Peida, a Taiwan legislator, explained that the measures were not the opinion of the Taiwan Provincial Government Council, but the public opinion of all the people of Taiwan, and were jointly decided by the central and local governments. If they were said to be unconstitutional, the central government had already begun to violate the constitution and must consider the actual situation in Taiwan. Those who wanted to go to Taiwan had already arrived in Taiwan. In the future, more could not be accommodated, so it had to be restricted. Ni Wenya said, "This matter can be asked to the Executive Yuan to transfer it to the Taiwan Provincial Government to ask." Wang Kaihua said, "If the Taiwan Provincial Government violates the law, it should be impeached by the Control Yuan. The interpretation of whether or not it violates the law should be handled by the Judicial Yuan. If the article of the measures is not well written, it should be amended." He advocated "temporary retention." Chen Sicheng advocated that this case should not be taken too seriously. He advocated retaining the case because the "single gangs" were active and had a great influence on Taiwan. Hou Shaowen emphasized that all situations in Taiwan were special and had a political function. Internally, one cannot only look at it from a legal point of view. Hou criticized Jiang Yiping's statement, saying that Jiang said that the withdrawal of signatures after signing was something he hoped to see less of in the future, while he said that he hoped that Committee Member Jiang would say less of this kind of thing in the future. Duan Jianmin advocated that the proposal be changed to a questioning case, and after the Taiwan Provincial Government's reply, it would be discussed again. It was nearly noon, and the chairman announced a stop to the discussion and put the three opinions of retaining the change to questioning and submitting for review to a vote. It was often passed according to the opinion of the procedure committee, and it was handed over to the Internal Affairs and Local Autonomy Committee for review. The meeting adjourned at twelve o'clock.

Legislative Yuan's Next Meeting Agenda: Discussing the Reform of the Banking System

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] The Legislative Yuan's Procedure Committee convened at 6:00 PM on the evening of the 5th and decided on the agenda for the next Yuan meeting. In addition to the various proposals that were not discussed in time at the 5th meeting, four proposals were added: (1) The examination report on amending the standards for clearing pre-war deposits and loans in the banking industry; (2) The proposal to amend the County Organization Law and simplify county-level institutions; (3) The examination report on stopping the levy of troops and grain; (4) The proposal to reform the banking system in order to develop the national economy and people's livelihood.

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] Legislative member Wang Lihang hosted the press at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th to explain the situation of national banking bureaus manipulating the market for his proposed reform of national financial institutions. He said that if the proposal could not be passed, he would decide to withdraw from the Legislative Yuan, and said that he had prepared the statement of withdrawal from the Legislative Yuan.

Legislative Yuan Economic Resources Committee to Review Economic Part of Policy Guidelines Today

Minister of Economic Affairs Sun Yueqi has been invited to attend the meeting to report and answer questions.

### People Throughout the Country Focus on the Peace Talks; Communist Party Strengthens Propaganda War; Xinhua News Agency Comments on "Where is the Nanjing Government Going?"; Inciting Government Personnel to Make Decisions Quickly

[Our News Report] At a time when people throughout the country are closely watching the development of peace talks, the Communist Party's propaganda war is becoming more active. The Communist Party's radio station broadcast a Xinhua News Agency editorial last night at 11:00 PM, titled "Where is the Nanjing Government Going?", filled with strong incitement, launching its war of nerves propaganda offensive, saying that the Communist army is about to march into the Jiangnan region, and no matter whether a peace agreement is signed or not, Nanjing should not hesitate any longer, but should know how to choose, and perform meritorious service to atone for its crimes. This commentary is clearly directed at people in the government-controlled areas, in order to achieve its propaganda effect. The commentary pointed out that there are only two roads facing the military and political personnel of the Nanjing government: one is to join forces with Chiang Kai-shek and the United States, and the other is to perform meritorious service in the "People's Liberation War" to atone for their crimes. Another type of person is one who is hesitating and confused, but their fate can be predicted to be rapid bankruptcy and decline. The commentary pointed out that the government of Li Zongren and He Yingqin, including the Zhang Zhizhong delegation, is basically a mixture of the first and third types of people. Those who are awakened and belong to the second type are extremely few. Therefore, the essence of their government is actually a tool of Chiang Kai-shek and the United States. The commentary also said that the figures in the government of Li Zongren and He Yingqin are still communicating with Chiang Kai-shek and the United States everywhere, and conspiring with each other. Now that the government has sent a peace delegation to Beiping, if it really has the sincerity for peace, it should start by handling the "Nanjing Massacre," arresting and severely punishing Chiang Kai-shek, Tang Enbo, Zhang Yaoming, and the "counter-revolutionary ringleaders" who oppose peace. Even if it is unable to do so, it should assist the Communist army in crossing the Yangtze River and performing meritorious service to atone for its crimes. The agency then incited government personnel to take practical actions immediately, break with Chiang Kai-shek and the United States, and implement Mao Zedong's eight peace conditions, and should no longer harbor the idea of pursuing an equal and honorable peace. Finally, the commentary declared that regardless of whether the Nanjing government accepts the eight conditions or not, the Communist army will continue to advance. If a comprehensive agreement is not signed, the method of partial negotiations will be used to seek a solution. The agency believes that although there may still be battles in the future, there will not be many more. The people in the government-controlled areas, whether this agreement is signed or not, should not hesitate any longer, and should immediately decide which road they should take.

### Two Supervisory Committee Members Visit Minister of Finance Liu

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] Supervisory Committee members Liang Shangdong and Xiong Zaiwei visited Minister of Finance Liu Gongyun on the morning of the 5th to discuss the preparations for investigating national property. Liu agreed to provide as much assistance as possible.

### Communist Party Demands that Government Not Cooperate with Britain and America

[Associated Press, This City Report] It is learned that the Communist Party has requested the government's peace delegation to agree to declare the abolition of diplomatic policies of cooperation with Western countries, and has listed it as an important part of the peace talks. A very reliable source revealed to the Associated Press that the Communist Party specifically stipulated that the British and American groups of countries should not be regarded as China's allies in any future coalition government. However, the Communist Party did not simultaneously request a joint declaration of alliance with the Soviet Union and its satellite group's ideals and practical goals, but this implication clearly existed. The Communist Party's demand for changing the Kuomintang government's current foreign policy towards Western countries is said to have been secretly presented to the government as early as late March, before the government delegation went straight to Beiping, as an amendment to Mao Zedong's eight conditions, but neither the Kuomintang nor the Communist Party intended to open it up, and the reason for this is unknown.

### Ministry of National Defense Stipulates Measures for Military and Civilians Crossing the Yangtze River

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] The Ministry of National Defense recently telegraphed the Jinghu Hang Garrison Headquarters to forward to the relevant agencies at the Yangtze River crossing points, stipulating six measures regarding crossing the Yangtze River: (1) Pukou, Guazhou, and Anqing in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are allowed to set up crossing points; (2) Inspection stations should be set up at each crossing point to manage the affairs of the crossing point; (3) Vessels without permission should be sunk without exception; (4) Government officials crossing the river on official business may cross the river, scattered soldiers and vagrants need to be registered and investigated before being ordered to be organized into teams to cross the river; (5) Public and educational personnel may cross the river on official business, and those not on official business may not cross the river and may not stay on the banks of the river; (6) It is strictly forbidden to transport "single gang" goods, and any cargo transportation is banned. Residents who need to cross the river should register with a guarantor, stating the task and the date of return. The crossing point between Xiaguan and Pukou has begun to comply with the order since it was received.

### Zhang Zhen Arrives in Changsha; Says that Henan Provincial Government Has Returned to Hankou

[Our Changsha Office, 5th] Henan Chairman Zhang Zhen arrived in Changsha at 8:00 AM on the 5th from Hankou. He said that the Henan Provincial Government had returned to Hankou from Xinyang and had become a "government in exile." The headquarters of the Fifth Pacification District has returned to Heshengqiao. Zhang is currently commanding five security brigades and five pacification brigades, totaling more than 40,000 people, and will be reorganized into one army and three independent brigades, which will be trained in their current garrison areas. Zhang's view on Xinyang being taken over was that it was a completely voluntary retreat, because Xinyang had long lost its strategic value, and another reason was to express sincerity for peace and withdraw without fighting. Zhang's impression of the prospects for peace talks was very negative. He said that the task of coming to Changsha was because the training area was adjacent to Hunan, so he specifically asked Director Cheng for instructions. After completing the public affairs negotiations in Hunan, Zhang returned to southern Hubei by Yuehan Railway train at 5:00 PM that afternoon.

### Premier He Flies to Guangzhou This Morning; Ministers of Interior and Finance and Others Accompany; Returning to Nanjing on the Weekend

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] Premier He Yingqin of the Executive Yuan is scheduled to fly from Nanjing to Guangzhou by special plane at 9:00 AM on the 6th to handle official business and return to Nanjing this weekend. Deputy Secretary-General Ni Tong-sheng, Minister of Interior Li Hanhun, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ye Gongchao, Minister of Finance Liu Gongyun, Vice Minister of Finance Xia Jinxiong, Director of Budget Pang Songzhou, and Legislative Yuan member Wei Yongcheng will accompany him. In addition to handling handover matters, He's trip will also exchange views with members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan and members of the Kuomintang Central Committee in Guangzhou.

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] Premier He held a cocktail party at the Xinsheng Society at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th, with all the members of the Supervisory Yuan in attendance, totaling more than 70 people, including the Premier and members of the Supervisory Yuan. Deputy Premier Jia Jingde of the Executive Yuan, Minister of Justice Zhang Zhiben, and Minister of Education Hang Liwu also participated. Free conversations took place during the meeting, which ended at 5:00 PM.

### Anqing Suburban Area Engaged in Full-Scale Bloody Battle; Communist Army Launches New Attack After Adjusting Deployment; Recovered Stronghold at Lama Temple North of Yizheng City

[Our Wuhu Office, 5th] The Anqing offensive and defensive battle, which was once silent on the 4th, became fierce again in the evening. After adjusting its deployment, the Third Corps of Chen Geng's unit launched a new attack from 10:00 PM, attacking the entire line from the outskirts of the city to Lion Mountain, Wuli Pier, Qipan Mountain, and the Agricultural and Forestry School. Among them, the offensive on the east line from the Agricultural School to Qipan Mountain was the fiercest. The National Army, with the cooperation of artillery, made every effort to resist, and was still engaged in a bloody battle until noon on the 5th. According to the military's judgment, after the Communist army's plan to capture Anqing before the start of the peace talks failed, it is now trying to occupy Anqing before agreeing to a ceasefire (not necessarily issuing a ceasefire order) and let its horses drink on the banks of the Yangtze River, so that if the peace talks break down, it can cross the river at any time. However, the facts of the past two weeks have proven the strength of the National Army's combat power, which seems to be beyond the Communist army's initial expectations.

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] Military circles in the capital commented on the Battle of Anqing, saying: "In the Battle of Anqing, thanks to the tenacious resistance of the defending troops of Tan Heyi's unit against the invading Eleventh Army of Chen Geng's unit, Chen's 31st Division has suffered heavy losses over the past two weeks, and the Communist army's offensive has been frustrated. It has only built fortifications and set up artillery positions around Anqing, using the tactics of besieging other cities in the past to apply to Anqing. However, because the Yangtze River, this living water, rescued this isolated city backed by water, the Jinghu Hang Garrison Headquarters has used ships to transport the main force of the Ninety-sixth Army into the isolated city for reinforcement over the past two weeks, and has also transported sufficient food and ammunition. Anqing is a large city on the north bank of the Yangtze River. If it is lost, it will be the best crossing point for the Communist army's crossing of the river in large formations, and its importance is second only to the city of Hankou in the western section of the Yangtze River. The National Army has stationed troops upstream and downstream of Anqing to prevent the Communist army from crossing the river, with the army defending the core and the periphery, the air force bombing the Communist army's artillery positions, strafing the Communist army's wooden boats on the river that are trying to sneak across to the sandbars, and the Communist army's reinforcement troops on the road from Shucheng and Tongcheng to Anqing. On a few clear starry nights, the planes that could not be dispatched were also able to navigate safely and dangerously dispatch themselves to bomb the Communist army's artillery positions around Anqing at night, so that Anqing could be defended. The Communist army can only look at the Yangtze River from the north bank and not get such a good crossing point to cover his large army crossing to the south. This famous city was defended by the famous general Chen Yucheng for several years during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era, so that Zeng Guofan could not capture Nanjing. At present, the naval power is all in the hands of the National Army, and it should be able to defend it for a long time. As long as the other sections of the Yangtze River are safe, the current situation is that Anqing can be defended if the three services cooperate."

[Our Zhenjiang Office, 5th] Confirmed news: Because the Anqing battle is tense, the Communist army in northern Jiangsu has been constantly mobilizing towards that direction in the past two days. Most of the Communist army in Yangzhou, Shijiaqiao, and other places facing Zhenjiang has been transferred away. The National Army, in order to express its determination to seek peace, has not pursued them.

[Our Zhenjiang Office, 5th] The important stronghold of Baliao Temple north of Yizheng, after being captured by the Communist army on the 4th, was counterattacked and recovered by the defending troops at dawn on the 5th, and is now advancing towards Xupu Bridge Town.

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] There were only minor contacts on the Puzhen front last night and today. It seems that more than a thousand Communist troops who sneaked into Lincun north of Jiangpu City and Gaowang west of the city on the night of the 4th intended to attack Jiangpu City. The National Army is on high alert.

### The Communist Forces of Lin Biao and Nie Rongzhen: Six Armies Enter Central China; National Army Determined to Defend the Final Fortress

[Our Hankou Office, 5th Dispatch] The military situation in Central China has entered a critical stage. According to observers in a certain area, as of now, in addition to the existing local communists, at least six armies of the communist forces under Lin Biao and Nie Rongzhen have entered the areas under the jurisdiction of the National Army in Central China. On one hand, they have deployed heavy troops on both sides of the railway along the Henan-Hubei border, instigating the local communists in eastern and northern Hubei to advance in separate groups towards the southern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, attempting to control key strongholds on the front lines before the major offensive to the south, actively establishing a posture for a central breakthrough. On the other hand, they are also gathering local communists in central and western Hubei to launch probing attacks to the south, feigning a westward advance to Yisha and an eastward advance to Guangji and Qichun, preparing for the crossing of the Yangtze River in Huangmei and Chishui. The National Army is fully aware of this situation and has long made thorough deployments. However, in order to safeguard the overall situation of the peace talks, they have repeatedly tolerated and retreated. Currently, the communist forces continue to invade southwards. For the sake of survival and resistance, the National Army is shortening its defensive lines and strengthening its defenses, in addition to mobile counterattacks on the southern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, determined to defend the final fortress. Even if the communist forces are accustomed to feinting east and attacking west, they will not be able to achieve their premeditated goals. Moreover, the National Army's retreats are mostly proactive. The gains and losses of a few strongholds along the Wuhan-Hankou line are not of great importance at present.

Editorial

### Cash Shortage, Tight Credit, Rising Prices

The cash shortage has been developing for the past four weeks, reaching a critical point by the end of last week. In commercial transactions, the premium on cash remains generally above 20%, and in Chongqing, it has shockingly reached 60%! The financial market is facing such a predicament that not only are general transactions hampered, but also people's daily lives are experiencing various inconveniences. The degree of inconvenience and exploitation is unprecedented! One wonders if the responsible authorities of the government have appropriate countermeasures. Is there still room to think about countermeasures? People generally believe that the only skill of the current financial authorities is the "printing press," but alas, even the work of the printing press cannot keep up with the demand. Who is responsible for this? Who caused this?

Regarding the current cash panic, let us take promissory notes, which are used as a substitute for cash in circulation, as an example. According to the report of the Bankers Association of this city, the portion of notes participating in the clearing on April 2nd alone exceeded 1.04 million. If we include promissory notes circulating in the market, it is not difficult to imagine the enormity of the figure. Yesterday, a person in the financial sector told a joke: if the market price of a silver dollar (Yuan Datou) reaches 25,000, then a 5,000-yuan promissory note is only worth two jiao (20 cents) of a silver dollar. Every day, many firms and stores are forced to hire extra staff specifically to issue and clear "two-jiao" notes at the clearing house. How can there not be a large number of promissory notes and delays? The common people obtain these promissory notes, but they are subject to the discretion of the firms and stores regarding their acceptability and the amount of the discount. They have no recourse, and who is to blame?

Frankly speaking, the cash shortage problem cannot be solved by promissory notes, and forcing people to issue promissory notes will only exacerbate the shortage. The root cause of the cash shortage is due to inflation itself and credit expansion under the fiscal deficit. However, the authorities' self-proclaimed measures of prohibiting the use of same-day promissory notes and suspending the issuance of transfer application forms undoubtedly increase the need for cash. Since society is forced to demand more cash, and yet the authorities are unwilling to honestly print larger denominations of banknotes to meet the demand, it is natural that the cash shortage will become increasingly severe. Today, the fundamental plan to prevent credit expansion still lies in closing the loopholes in finance. If only piecemeal measures are taken or the authorities pride themselves on fighting speculators, it will not only fail to achieve the desired effect but also harm real industries. For example, the aforementioned measures of prohibiting the use of same-day promissory notes and suspending the issuance of transfer application forms have failed to tighten credit and withdraw money from circulation. On the contrary, they have deepened the severity of the cash shortage, which is truly "more harm than good."

The tools used by central banks in various countries to contract credit and tighten money supply include intensifying the use of open market policies, raising the rediscount rate, and the reserve requirement for bank deposits. In addition, high interest rates are also used to directly absorb idle funds from the market or to force commercial banks to borrow. However, due to the imperfect nature of our country's central bank and the weak financial resources of general commercial firms and stores, it is very difficult to achieve this task at the moment. Looking at the past measures of our country's central bank to tighten money supply and contract credit, they are nothing more than selling limited materials, such as gold, silver, yarn, white sugar, foreign exchange transfer certificates, and materials from other state-owned enterprises. Although this is sufficient to combat temporary price increases, how can it offset the expenditure of huge military and administrative expenses? Therefore, under the authorities' selling policies, even though the central bank has "net inflow" figures every day, in reality, it cannot often have a significant effect on easing the money supply in the market. Sometimes, the central bank clearly has a large "net inflow" of funds, but the money supply in the market may instead exhibit a general loosening phenomenon. For example, the dramatic tightening and loosening of money supply on Saturday (the 2nd of this month) was influenced by the expenditure of the national treasury. These facts further demonstrate that our country's current central bank may not truly have the power to control the market and contract the money supply. As a result, the magnitude of price fluctuations is also beyond the control of the central bank. As for selling 6,000 gold bars on the 4th to tighten the capital position, it is still only a temporary phenomenon. Even if all the government's gold is sold off, how long can the money supply be tightened? And what will happen once it is sold out? We cannot bear to say.

Currently, the factors driving up prices are, on the one hand, the enormous military expenditures and the contraction of productive capacity. On the other hand, it is the long-term loosening of the money supply, which has created a situation of abundant idle funds, especially with the general psychology of valuing goods over currency. Therefore, the rise and fall of current prices are no longer entirely governed by the law of supply and demand. Sometimes, the relationship between prices and the money supply also exhibits particularly subtle and contradictory phenomena. For example, on Friday (the 1st of this month), although the money supply in the market was extremely tight, goods were still expected to rise in price, and the buying sentiment was still strong, which is a prime example. Furthermore, the recently occurring cash premium is also a factor stimulating price increases. Because ordinary general commodities, in addition to the normal price, must now also include the profit from the cash premium, which implicitly creates another new price. Regardless of whether this new price is reasonable, it is undeniably an excuse for merchants to raise prices. Due to the cash premium and the long-term loosening of the money supply, the rise in prices is accelerated. Furthermore, due to the rise in prices, the government's expenditure is increased, and people's psychology of "buying in advance" is intensified, which in turn leads to excessive credit expansion. Under the current situation of excessive credit expansion, cash naturally cannot meet the needs of circulation. At the same time, due to the outflow of large amounts of treasury funds from time to time, an extremely loose money supply in the market is naturally formed. After reaching this stage, the three factors cycle back and forth, creating a vicious cycle of cause and effect. As a result, it is feared that the country will only move towards the brink of economic collapse and face a desperate situation! Can our government authorities still be complacent with the reason of "the superiors and subordinates contending for profits"?

In short, the pathological condition of our country's current economy is fully exposed, and dangerous situations are emerging. The problems of cash shortage, money supply, and prices, in a nutshell, are simply that the leakage of the deficit finance is too large. Because the leakage of the deficit finance cannot be compensated for by other means, it has led to a vicious expansion of credit and inflation, losing the ability to truly control the money supply and prices. As for the cash shortage problem, it is only an inevitable product of the contradictory phenomenon of credit expansion and inflation. However, the financial authorities have made man-made errors in technology, which has further deepened the severity of the cash shortage and the suffering of the people! The saying "voices of complaint are everywhere" is somewhat true today.

### US Senate and House of Representatives Pass Bill Approving Continued Economic Aid to China; Guarantee that US Aid Will Not Be Used in Communist Areas

[US News Service, Washington, 4th Dispatch] The United States Senate and House of Representatives took action on the 4th, approving the continuation of US economic aid to China. The Senate's action was the passage of an amendment to the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) appropriation bill currently under debate, while the House of Representatives' action was the approval of another bill for this aid.

The actions of both houses will be a preparation to use the $54 million that has not yet been used out of the $275 million in economic aid to China passed by the 80th Congress. This aid is being implemented by the ECA.

The Senate amendment, proposed by Republican Senator Knowland of California, will authorize the use of funds to assist those parts of China "which the President determines are not under Communist control." Knowland stated that recent statements by the Chinese Communists that they would support the Soviet Union in the event of a war between the Soviet Union and the West make this notification an "order."

The Senate passed Knowland's amendment by voice vote, with only Republican Senator Langer of North Dakota declaring his opposition.

The House of Representatives passed another bill by a vote of 279 to 60, after Chairman Eaton of the House Foreign Affairs Committee guaranteed that US aid would not fall into the hands of the Communists. Eaton stated that any funds will definitely not be used in areas controlled by the Communists or given to governments controlled by the Communists. He also stated that the intention of the bill is to ensure that any aid is not given to any Chinese coalition government with Communist participation.

Under the 1948 China Aid Act, the ECA's aid to China ended last Saturday, and the unused funds were returned to the US Treasury Department. Therefore, the House bill will authorize the restoration of a $50 million advance to the Finance Corporation to continue the China aid program until the $54 million that has not been used is re-appropriated. The re-appropriated funds will be authorized for use until February 15, 1950. Neither the Senate's nor the House's actions today can be taken as absolutely definitive, as the differences in the two bills and the form of the final legislation still need to be determined by the two houses.

[Local News] The North China Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), Davis, arrived in Shanghai on April 3rd and is scheduled to hold a press conference at the Cathay Hotel at 10:00 AM on Wednesday, the 6th.

### Xiangxi, Anjiang, and Hongjiang May Be Preserved; Bandits Retreat and Indicate Willingness to Be Appeased; Deputy Commander of the Provincial Security Forces, Wang Jinxiu, Resigns and is Approved

[Our Changsha Office, 5th Dispatch] Wang Jinxiu, the Deputy Commander of the Security Forces who went to Yuanling to deal with the rebellious people, has resigned and his resignation has been approved. Peng Jieru will succeed him. The bandits who were roaming in Anjiang and Hongjiang have completely retreated on the 4th, and the two places may be preserved. Currently, the bandits have indicated their willingness to be appeased. The Pacification Headquarters has sent Senior Staff Officer Yang Chunfu to negotiate. It is heard that Yang has arrived in Zhijiang. In addition, the Pacification Headquarters has appointed Long Jiao as the commander of the suppression and pacification of the four counties of Yongshui, Qiancheng, and Fenghuang, responsible for handling the task of suppressing and pacifying the rebellious bandits in the four counties.

[Our Changsha Office, 5th Dispatch] It was previously reported that Ms. Mo Danyun, one of the two representatives elected by the Hunanese legislators in Nanjing to return to Hunan to persuade Qian (Chengqian, the Governor of Hunan) to reconsider, has arrived in Changsha. According to her, this trip is entirely for family matters. When the Hunanese legislators gathered for a dinner on the 18th of last month, they felt that the details of the Xiangxi incident published in the Beijing and Shanghai newspapers were difficult to suppress, and they all advocated "pacification over suppression." At that time, it was indeed proposed that Committee Member Tang and herself take the opportunity of returning to Hunan to convey this message, but it did not involve anything else. As for the rumors of a "movement to overthrow Cheng (Qian)" and a "partial reorganization of the provincial government," it is unknown where they originated.

### Song Xilian Arrives in Changsha Yesterday; An Organization Will Be Established on the Hunan-Hubei Border; The Claim of Establishing a Border Affairs Office for Four Provinces is Inaccurate

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 5th Dispatch] Song Xilian, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Suppression Headquarters in Central China, arrived in Changsha from Hankou on the morning of the 5th. It is said that the purpose of this trip is to meet with Director Cheng Qian to discuss issues related to defense. He will stay for one or two days and then go to Changde and then to the Public Security area to inspect the river defense. Song continued to say that the central government believes that the military strategic position of the contiguous areas of central Hubei south of the Yangtze, and northwestern Hunan is important, and plans to establish an organization responsible for military and political affairs in the Hunan-Hubei border area, which he himself will concurrently head. The official name and location have not yet been clearly defined. The claim that a Border Affairs Office will be established for the four border areas of Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Guizhou is inaccurate. Speaking of the Communist forces crossing the Yangtze River to attack, Song believes that this is a gesture by the Communist side, hoping to use this to threaten the government during the peace talks to accept more stringent conditions beyond the limits of tolerance. He emphasized that strengthening the river defense, firmly defending the Yangtze River, and preventing the Communist forces from invading south are the most important tasks of the National Army at present, and also powerful conditions for striving for genuine peace. Speaking of the Xiangxi rebellion, Song believes that the situation is not complicated and advocates conducting guidance. Local armed forces that do not harm the interests of the people and do not use holding guns and advocating chaos as a threat, the government can consider incorporating them and giving them the opportunity to serve the country.

### Atlantic Pact Just Signed, Third UN General Assembly Resumes Yesterday, Foreign Ministers of Contracting States Participate in Opening Ceremony, Decide on Countermeasures Against Soviet Attacks

[Reuters, Lake Success, 5th] The Third Session of the United Nations General Assembly resumed here today, with an address by the President of the General Assembly, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt. The foreign ministers of various countries who will attend the first meeting after the resumption include Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson, Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen, French Foreign Minister Schuman, Icelandic Foreign Minister Benediktsson, Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker, Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange, and British Foreign Secretary Bevin. The chief representative of the United Kingdom to the General Assembly is Minister of State McNeil, and the chief representative of the Soviet Union is Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko. The items on the agenda of this General Assembly include the disposal of Italian colonies, the treatment of Indians in South Africa, the Chilean proposal to condemn the Soviet Union's violation of basic human rights, the Polish proposal to impose economic sanctions on Franco's Spain, and the veto issue. However, the most important issue is the Atlantic Pact, which is not on the agenda. It is expected that the Soviet representative will try to debate in the General Assembly this alliance, which they consider to be anti-Soviet and in violation of the United Nations Charter.

[United Press, New York, 4th] While the North Atlantic Treaty was signed in Washington today, the head of the Soviet delegation to the UN, Gromyko, remained here as usual. Some representatives to the UN believe that Gromyko is preparing to attack the treaty at the UN meeting.

[Our Dispatch] Washington, 5th Broadcast: The foreign ministers of seven countries traveled to New York one after another by car on the morning of the 5th to prepare to attend the General Assembly. Bevin, Stikker, and Benediktsson departed at 9 a.m., and Spaak, Baker, Lange, and Rasmussen departed at 10 a.m. Bevin went straight to the station in an embassy car. He told reporters, "I cannot predict whether the discussions with the State Department on German issues this Thursday will yield results, but I do not intend to discuss the issue of colonies and will leave it to the delegation to discuss at the General Assembly." Bevin said that he still hopes to take the "Mauritania" ship to leave New York on Friday. Bevin will return the next day to attend the State Department meeting. French Foreign Minister Schuman, who left here for New York last night, is also expected to return at the same time.

[United Press, Lake Success, 5th] The second half of the Third Session of the United Nations General Assembly opened here on the 5th. The General Assembly will first hold elections to fill vacancies in the main committees of the General Assembly. It is expected that van Kleffens of Belgium will be succeeded by Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Spaak as Chairman of the Political and Security Committee. It is said that Spaak's abandonment of this position may allow him to devote more time to his work in Brussels. The General Assembly will then adjourn for one day. The General Committee will hold a meeting to draft recommendations for the order of the agenda. The US delegation has held several final meetings to discuss US strategies and motions. Sources say that if Gromyko takes the initiative, the United States is prepared to defend the Atlantic Pact with other signatory countries, but Western countries will not take the initiative.

[Central News Agency, New York, 4th] Gu Weijun, the head of our delegation, stated that the Chinese delegation is very concerned about the issues of Indonesia and South Africa's discrimination against overseas Chinese, because there are a large number of overseas Chinese in Indonesia, and China has always opposed racial discrimination. Furthermore, what the Chinese people are interested in is the issue of using Chinese, because China and the Soviet Union are now requesting the General Assembly to use their two languages. After Chinese is used, the United Nations will have to increase its annual expenditure by 800,000 yuan and increase the number of Chinese interpreters to handle meetings and documents.

### Unilaterally Changing the Western Border of Germany, the Soviet Union Protests to Britain, the United States, and France, Washington Is Studying It Closely

[United Press, London, 5th] According to TASS Moscow, 5th, the Soviet Union has lodged notes with the three Western powers, condemning the three countries for illegally changing the western border of Germany. TASS stated that the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Zarubin, submitted the Soviet protest to the British Foreign Office on the 4th, and the Soviet ambassadors to the United States and France also submitted similar protests to the US State Department and the French Foreign Ministry respectively. According to Western countries, they announced on March 26 an agreement to cede approximately 52 square miles of former German territory to France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.

[United Press, Washington, 5th] It is expected that Britain, the United States, and France will immediately reject the Soviet Union's protest regarding the modification of the western border of Germany. They recalled that the Soviet Union instigated the cession of 39,986 square miles of eastern Germany to Poland in 1945.

[United Press, Washington, 4th] The State Department has received the Soviet Union's protest regarding the change of the western border of Germany, and its contents are being studied, but it refused to disclose the contents of the protest.

### East and West Blocs: Comparison of Manpower

[Reuters, Washington, 4th] The twelve countries of the North Atlantic Treaty have a total population of 332,439,000, while the seven countries of the Soviet bloc, the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania, have a total population of 274,739,000, so the former is 15% more than the latter. However, in terms of military manpower, including the number of personnel in the regular army and navy, the countries of the Atlantic Pact are approximately equal to the Soviet bloc, but the reserves are not included. The three countries of the Atlantic Pact, Britain, the United States, and France, have a total of 3,113,000 armed forces, and the total number of armed forces in the twelve countries is 4,148,000. The total number of armed forces in the Soviet Union is 5,171,000, of which the Soviet Union alone accounts for 4,050,000. In terms of naval power, the total strength of the navies of the United States, Britain, and other countries of the pact is far above that of the Soviet bloc. There is no precise estimate of air force strength, but the number of aircraft on both sides is approximately equal, but Western countries have more long-range aircraft. In addition, the steel production of Western bloc countries exceeds the Soviet bloc by three times, coal production exceeds two times, oil production exceeds approximately eight times, merchant ship tonnage exceeds 34 times, and motorized vehicles exceed approximately three times.

### Foreign Ministers of Twelve Countries Explain the Goals of the Atlantic Pact, Emphasizing Collective Defense Against Aggression, Determined to Strengthen the United Nations Organization

[Reuters, Washington, 4th] The foreign ministers of eleven countries signed the Atlantic Pact here today, formally agreeing to recognize an armed attack on one of the contracting states as an attack on all contracting states. As the foreign ministers signed in alphabetical order of their country's names, cameras and video cameras were all deployed to record this historic moment. US Secretary of State Acheson, in his capacity as host, welcomed the foreign ministers of the eleven countries, saying: "This treaty is a serious warning to those who are moving towards aggression, telling them to be careful if they invade others. This alliance is the crystallization of common ideas over centuries and the blood of many heroic men and women. Today, not only the people of the Atlantic countries, but even the nations of the world seeking freedom and peace, have increased their strength and courage." President Truman addressed the audience as a guest before the foreign ministers finished their speeches and began signing (see yesterday's dispatch). British Foreign Secretary Bevin expressed satisfaction that the pact had received unanimous support from the British people. He said: "In the era in which we live today, on the one hand, the countries participating in this pact are working hard to revive the world's prosperity and happiness, but their efforts are constantly threatened. We must unite and use the resources of the Atlantic countries to build our strength. Our people will never succumb to aggression. After the signing of this pact, democracy has become a close and powerful organization. Our task does not end here. We must build a truly global United Nations organization." Italian Foreign Minister Sforza praised the Atlantic Pact as a tool sufficient to deter aggression, but it is not enough to simply sign the pact. Human society will be revitalized through the constant cooperation of the contracting states to strive for peace. Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker pointed out that the signing of the Atlantic Pact is the realization of an ideal, making the United Nations organization a body that can guarantee world peace, and also signifies the birth of new hope for lasting peace. Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen claimed that the United States' signing of the Atlantic Pact indicates that it is prepared to support democratic and peace-loving nations at any time. Denmark's participation in the Atlantic Pact is because the pact is an instrument of peace, and its sole purpose is to prevent armed aggression against any contracting state. Portuguese Foreign Minister Mateus emphasized that the Atlantic Pact is an instrument of defense and international cooperation, because it is necessary to protect the principles of those who hold Western civilization and its position in the world. Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak believes that the signing of the Atlantic Pact is an act of trusting in the fate of Western civilization. It serves peace and is also the most powerful tool for protecting peace. French Foreign Minister Schuman emphasized that the Atlantic Pact meets France's own needs and declared that France's joining the Atlantic Pact will not conflict with the treaty that France has already signed with the Soviet Union. Because there are many possible dangers, there must also be many preventive measures. Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange called the Atlantic Pact a pact of peace. He said that Norway is seeking greater security guarantees in addition to the guarantees that it should enjoy as a member of the United Nations. Norway previously attempted to establish a Scandinavian regional pact based on the United Nations Charter, but it was unsuccessful, so it decided to join the Atlantic Pact. Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson pointed out that although the Atlantic Pact is very helpful for security and stability, it cannot ensure peace by itself. He urged the contracting states to implement the promises in the pact, so that the pact will not become a mere scrap of paper. Icelandic Foreign Minister Benediktsson stated that Iceland has a very important strategic position in the North Atlantic region, so Iceland's joining the Atlantic Pact is not only for its own security but also for the security of others.

### Italy on Full Alert to Prevent Communist Activities, the Soviet Union Protests the Italian-American-Western Alliance

### Truman to Consult Senate This Week to Approve the Atlantic Pact, Foreign Affairs Committee Scheduled to Hear Opinions on the 11th

[United Nations, Washington, 5th] Officials predicted today that President Truman will send the North Atlantic Treaty to the Senate this week, requesting speedy approval, which is one of the three major steps to implement the treaty. In addition, there are two major steps: one is to complete the US military assistance program, with a budget of approximately 2 billion yuan. It is expected that Truman will submit a proposal to Congress next week. The third is for the twelve contracting states to discuss the establishment of a council and a defense committee, whose task is to unify the defense plans of Western non-communist countries.

[United Press, Washington, 5th] The Atlantic Pact is likely to be approved by the Senate, but it is doubtful whether Congress will fully support the plan to provide military assistance to Western Europe.

### Pravda Article Criticizes Britain and the United States for Organizing the Pacific Group, Using Political Alliances as Tools of Aggression

[TASS, Moscow, 4th] Marinin wrote an article in "Pravda" discussing the plans of the organizers of the Atlantic Pact in the Pacific region. Recently, Australian Minister of Childers Lundman confirmed in an official statement that negotiations on the signing of a "Pacific Regional Pact" are underway.

According to the newspaper, the special envoys sent by the British Labour government to Australia, New Zealand, India, Canada, and South Africa are particularly enthusiastic about this consultation.

Prior to this "consultation," a number of countries in Asia and the Middle East held a meeting in Delhi in January this year, ostensibly to discuss the Indonesian issue, but its real purpose was to pave the way for the implementation of the British and American plan to organize a Pacific Group. Britain and the United States hope that this reactionary political alliance will develop into an aggressive military-political group. Marinin continued, "It is very clear that the Asian appendages of the Atlantic Pact will completely submit to the ruling figures of the United States, and they will especially use this group to invade Britain's self-governing territories and separate them from the British Empire. Japan has a special role in Wall Street's invasion plan in the Pacific region. The Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister has suggested to the governments of Britain, the United States, and some countries in the Pacific region that they conclude a Pacific Pact with Japan, following the example of the North Atlantic Treaty. This is a step carefully designed and prepared by American diplomats." Marinin concluded by writing that the plan for the Pacific Group that is being organized is very clear. It is launched by the Anglo-American imperialist war camp to deal with the forces that uphold stable democratic peace.

### Graded Calculation of Rent Records and Donations, Generally Adjusted According to the Cost of Living Index, City Government Passed the Resolution Yesterday and Will Send It to the Senate for Decision

[Our Dispatch] The draft of the city's rent standard and the method of adjusting housing donations have been revised and approved by the city government at a temporary municipal meeting held yesterday. It will be submitted to the general meeting of the Senate to be held in the middle of the month for discussion and approval, and will be implemented from this month. Because the detailed rules and regulations still need to be sorted out before being sent to the Senate for discussion, they were not submitted yesterday. The city government officials present kept their mouths shut, saying that it was not yet the stage for publication. Because rent and housing donations are closely related to the lives of all citizens of Shanghai, our reporter specially asked Chen Liang, Secretary-General of the City Government, who revealed when entertaining reporters after the meeting of the Rice and Grain Association that the standards for collecting rent and housing donations will be adjusted according to the cost of living index. The level of the base number is directly proportional to the grade of the quality of the house, that is, the larger and better the house is, the higher the amount that should be borne, and the burden on ordinary households will be reduced as much as possible.

It is understood that the new standard for rent has been decided to be divided into five grades: (1) For rents before the war below 50 yuan, 10% of it will be taken as the base number, multiplied by the current cost of living index, which is the current rent. (2) For rents before the war between 51 yuan and 100 yuan, 15% of it will be taken as the base number. (3) For rents before the war between 101 yuan and 200 yuan, 20% of it will be taken as the base number. (4) For rents before the war between 201 yuan and 300 yuan, 25% of it will be taken as the base number. (5) For rents before the war above 300 yuan, 30% of it will be taken as the base number. Although the above standards have been decided, they will not be forcibly implemented. If the landlord and tenant have a contract for the rent, the payment will be made in accordance with the original contract. If a dispute arises between the landlord and tenant in the future and a request for mediation is made, the Land Administration Bureau will mediate in accordance with this new standard.

As for the collection of housing donations, the original collection is also adjusted according to the cost of living index, but it is completely different from rent. The base number for the current housing donations and municipal construction donations is based on the re-estimated total value of houses in the 26th year of the Republic of China. For commercial buildings, 14 per thousand is collected, and for residential buildings, 8 per thousand is collected, and the landlord and tenant each bear half of it. At the beginning of the issuance of the Gold Yuan Certificate, housing donations were the largest source of all tax revenues in the city, but the value of the currency depreciated rapidly, and housing donations were never adjusted, resulting in an unreasonable phenomenon. The current housing donations range from 2.3 yuan to several thousand yuan. After this decision to adjust according to the cost of living index, the city government will divide the donation amount in the autumn of the 37th year of the Republic of China into several grades to determine the base number. The level of the base number is also directly proportional to the total value of the house. In general, ordinary civilians will only be required to bear the lowest level, and houses with superior construction will be subject to progressive taxation.

In addition, housing donations will still be collected in four seasons, spring, summer, autumn, and winter, each year. The housing donation for each season is the base number multiplied by the cost of living index for the next period of the previous month. Housing donations have not been collected from this year. After the above new method is passed by the City Senate, it will be implemented from the summer. As for how to recover the housing donations for the spring, the city government will further study its technical problems.

### Mayor's Car Has Four Tires Damaged, City Government Sends New Tires to Hangzhou in a Hurry

[Our Reporter] The 1948 Buick car that Mayor Wu took to Hangzhou on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway was damaged due to the road surface being uneven due to disrepair of the highway for many years. After arriving in Hangzhou, the four tires were completely damaged and could not be used. Because Mayor Wu urgently wanted to take the car to Xikou to visit President Chiang, he entrusted the Hangzhou Municipal Government to replace the tires. However, because the mayor's car was a 1948 product, which had just been shipped from the United States not long ago, all the tires in Hangzhou were old and none could fit this car. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Government was telegraphed "urgently" yesterday. Upon receiving the telegram, the General Affairs Office of the City Government immediately tried to find four pairs of new tires and a small box of parts, carefully packaged them, and sent a special envoy to the Two-Road Bureau, requesting the bureau to send them to the Flag Protection Municipal Government for forwarding to Mayor Wu as quickly as possible. The Road Bureau accepted the entrustment and handed them over to the 43rd Shanghai-Hangzhou express train, which departed at 22:05 that evening, and delivered them by the fastest means. The tires and parts could arrive in Hangzhou at 3:30 this morning.

Constant Bombardment: Duanmu Feng Holds a Grain Conference at the Municipal Government to Review the Reasons for Rising Rice Prices; Four Relief Measures Resolved

[Our Report] The municipal authorities convened a grain conference in the municipal government conference room at 3:00 PM yesterday to seek adequate grain sources and stabilize rice prices. The meeting was chaired by Secretary-General Chen Liang, with the attendance of more than a dozen representatives from over ten units, including the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Public Opinion Survey Office, the Bureau of Financial Management, the Business Bureau of the National Bank, the North and South Rice Markets, and the Rice Merchants Association. Secretary-General Chen first explained the significance of convening the conference today, which is to seek adequate grain sources, stabilize grain prices, and stabilize society and people's hearts. Subsequently, Director Cao Peizi of the Bureau of Social Affairs reviewed the reasons for rising grain prices and provided suggestions for stabilizing grain prices. Participating representatives also expressed their opinions separately. After detailed discussion, Secretary-General Chen made the following comprehensive conclusions: A. Reasons for rising grain prices: (1) The scope of grain sources is gradually shrinking, the population is gradually increasing, and demand exceeds supply. (2) There is a shortage of cash, replaced by promissory notes and checks, with excessively high discount rates and difficulties in remittance. (3) Transportation is inconvenient, grain sources are not smooth, and there are instances of prohibiting grain exports in various places. (4) The lean season is approaching, and citizens tend to hoard, stimulating grain prices. (5) The current situation is unstable, rumors arise, people's hearts are turbulent, and they store and purchase grain, heavily affected by the chain stimulation of rising prices of other commodities.

Purchase and Store Immediately: 1.2 Million Dan

B. Relief measures: (1) According to the statistics of the grain allocation agencies, Shanghai needs about 800,000 dan of rice per month, and the allocation of rice has reached 550,000 dan, which is two-thirds of the total demand. The allocated rice for April, May, June, and July in this city has been prepared, and the allocation of rice after July is also being planned, so there is no need for people to panic. In addition, the free grain market has more than 300,000 dan of rice in stock in April, and the demand from the market is only about 200,000 dan from citizens in addition to household rice. Then the total demand for May, June, July, and August, calculated at a monthly demand of 300,000 dan, is 1.2 million dan. The meeting resolved to immediately find ways to purchase and store the full amount, and decided that the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank would be responsible for purchasing 600,000 dan, and the Rice Merchants Association would be responsible for purchasing 600,000 dan, and the government would provide various conveniences.

Procurement Methods to Be Determined on the 8th

Furthermore, the government will have the competent authorities formulate implementation measures for procurement, and the grain merchants will have the Rice Merchants Association formulate procurement measures. It is scheduled to be reviewed and decided jointly at the municipal government at 3:00 PM on the 8th of this month (Friday). (2) For the problems of cash shortage, promissory notes, checks, discount rates, and difficulties in remittance, please ask the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank to quickly find ways to improve them. (3) Submit a request to the Executive Yuan to reiterate the previous order for the free flow of grain in the provinces along the Yangtze River, and all localities must abide by it and must not prohibit exports. Please ask the Ministry of Transportation to provide various conveniences, and please ask the Jinghu Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters to transfer orders to military police in various places to protect the grain. (4) Since the funding and procurement methods for the grain needed in Shanghai have been decided, the responsible authorities should actively carry them out. Therefore, there will be no problem with grain before August. Starting in September, new grain will be available, and there will be no need to worry about the people's food supply.

White Japonica Rice Limited to 170,000 per Dan

City General Union of Labor Resolves Three Methods Because Promissory Notes for Salary Payments Cause Excessive Losses

The City General Union of Labor held its eighth standing committee meeting yesterday afternoon, chaired by Zhou Xuexiang. During the meeting, a heated discussion was held on the issue that cash is extremely scarce in the market and manufacturers often issue salaries in promissory notes, causing workers to suffer huge losses from interest discounts. As a result, three points were resolved: (1) Request the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Municipal Government to forward a request to the National Bank to notify all factories that wages should be paid in cash. (2) If it is unavoidable to issue promissory notes, they must not be rejected in the market and no discounts can be applied. (3) If workers suffer losses due to interest discounts when using promissory notes, the factory should be responsible for compensating the workers. In addition, regarding the issue of raising the threshold for workers' income tax, it was resolved to hand it over to the workers' income tax research group to convene a meeting this Friday to decide on a method. It is heard that representatives will be sent to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Finance if necessary.

Turning Big Problems into Small Ones, Turning Small Problems into Nothing: The Incident of Lanchow Police and Military Beating Teachers Settled Peacefully; The Truth About the Private Arms Trafficking Case Has Been Revealed

Our Reporter: Song Lin

[Aviation News from Lanzhou, 1st] Regarding another storm caused by the Lanchow Eastern District Military Police Corps cracking down on a private arms trafficking case – the injury to Yu Junjie, a teacher at Lanchow Middle School, resulting in the indignation of over a thousand middle school students – the incident has been completely quelled through the swift and wise handling of the authorities. The truth about the private arms trafficking case that triggered the incident has also come to light.

Regarding the incident of mistakenly beating a teacher at Lanchow Middle School, Chairman Guo appointed Provincial Government Secretary-General Ding Yizhong, Director of Education Song Ke, Lanchow Garrison Commander Zhou Jiabin, Commander of the 22nd Military Police Regiment Cao Shuxi, and Director of the Provincial Capital Police Bureau Guo Zhuang to form a joint meeting on March 23 to handle the matter swiftly. They accepted all four conditions proposed by the teachers and students of Lanchow, including sending the perpetrator to military law for handling, compensating for medical expenses, publishing an apology in the newspaper, and ensuring that similar incidents do not occur in the future. At the same time, the students were advised to resume classes immediately. Upon hearing the news, all teachers and students expressed satisfaction. They all attended the flag-lowering ceremony at 4 PM that afternoon, and evening self-study was conducted as usual.

The eight people involved in the incident, including Military Police Zhou Jingwei, Yao Weixiang, Xu Junmin, Ru Chengxiang, Yang Liju, Police Gao Hanzhang, Hai Zhongyi, and accomplice Wen Huade, a driver from the 19th Engineer Regiment, were presented to the Military Law Office of the Northwest Military and Political Administration for interrogation and were formally sentenced on March 24: Wen Huade and Zhou Jingwei were each sentenced to two years and two months of imprisonment for jointly causing bodily harm to others. Yao Weixiang, Xu Junmin, Yang Liju, and Ru Chengxiang were found not guilty. Gao Hanzhang and Hai Zhongyi were not accepted because they did not have military status and were transferred to the Gao Lan Local Court for handling. At the same time, Military Police Commander Cao Shuxi and Police Bureau Director Guo Zhuang jointly published an urgent announcement in the local newspapers for three days, stating that the military police and police were not educated enough, resulting in the injury to Mr. Yu, and they were deeply ashamed and apologized for this. Yu Junjie's medical and other expenses were also borne jointly by both parties. A misunderstanding thus came to an end.

As for the four pistols and thirty bullets seized from Huang Qianfu's home in Gengjiazhuang, because the principal offender Huang Qianfu never dared to show up, only "Director Zhang Zhiyi from a certain alley" came to the Military Police Regiment to state that he had sent Zhang Zixin to Huang Qianfu's home to borrow guns to prepare for personal protection on his return to Dingxi. On March 25, the Military Police Regiment received an official letter from the Air Force 254 Supply Squadron, where Huang Qianfu's son Huang Yaoxing served, proving that three of the four pistols were purchased by Gao Shangxin, the squadron leader of the team, during the Wuji Sect rebellion in Gansu in 1939, specifically for self-defense. Recently, they were handed over to Huang Yaoxing to take home to wipe the oil, not owned by the Huang family. The Military Police Regiment immediately released the arrested Zhang Zixin on bail, and Huang Qianfu's son Huang Yaoxing was also handed over to the supply squadron for handling. These guns and bullets, which almost caused a catastrophe, were also retrieved by the Air Force Supply Squadron to close the case.

A Prosperous Year Foretold by Snow in Spring: Someone Plants Opium in Jingyuan

Provincial Civil Affairs Director Sends Letter Ordering Investigation and Eradication

[Aviation News from Lanzhou, 31st] Since the beginning of spring, the cold has been biting in various parts of Gansu Province, with widespread snowfall, the largest of which was in Linze County, with snowfall reaching nine inches. Other areas include Lintan with one inch, Xiji with three inches, Wenxian with two inches, Qingyang with one inch, Wushan with 3.5 mm of snow and rain, and Lanzhou with more than 3 mm of snow. A good harvest is expected this year.

The agricultural loan plan for this year has been re-established by the Gansu Provincial Branch of the Central Cooperative Treasury, including fourteen counties and cities, with a total loan amount of 382 million yuan. The 3 million silver dollars of construction bonds to be issued by the Gansu Provincial Government will also be allocated one-third to subsidize rural sideline occupations and develop small-scale water conservancy. The agricultural bank's large-scale water conservancy loan in Gansu has been approved for 400 million yuan and is in the process of being issued, further ensuring the spring plowing.

However, according to visitors from eastern Gansu: Because the counties in eastern Gansu are close to the Communist area, the self-defense special donation is being urged to be collected, and most people are selling wheat or borrowing to pay it, resulting in the phenomenon of "cheap grain injuring farmers" and "high-interest exploitation." Currently, one stone of wheat only sells for more than one silver dollar (according to the Lanzhou market price of about three yuan). The local specialty hemp, which used to sell for more than ten silver dollars before the war, is now so low that no one wants it even at 2.7 yuan. Only usury is rampant, with the highest interest rate of over 30% for 100 silver dollars. In order to thoroughly eliminate usury, the Gansu Provincial Government has recently announced a method of banning it, stipulating that debtors can refuse to pay the annual interest rate exceeding 20% (this method does not apply to commercial loans). At the same time, it prevents local bullies from manipulating agricultural loans, so that the livelihood of poor farmers can be maintained, social order can be stabilized, and the ideal of the people's livelihood can be initially realized.

At this time of turbulent times, there are widespread rumors of opium planting in other counties. County A传 county B has already planted, and county B 傅 county C seeds, but in reality, everyone is in a wait-and-see attitude. Most people are watching whether the wealthy and powerful households in this county will take the lead in planting. It is rumored that a part of the Beiwang Township area in Jingyuan County has already sown seeds under the protection of "Yiguandao," and some farmland originally prepared to sow wheat has also stopped sowing and is in a wait-and-see attitude. The local Baojia chiefs have reported the opium and looker on's to their superiors. Ma Jizhou, Director of Civil Affairs, specifically sent letters to county heads, township heads, and chief staff, hoping that they would promptly mobilize Baojia personnel to investigate and eradicate them in detail, and expand the publicity of the government's consistent determination to ban opium and drugs. Anyone who secretly plants opium and harbors opium planting will be severely punished once verified.

Visitor from Gangu Talks about the History of the Gold Yuan Coupon

[Aviation News from Lanzhou, 1st] A visitor from Gangu said: After the issuance of the Gold Yuan Coupon on August 19 last year, the black market exchange rate of each silver dollar in the Gangu market was 5.5 million yuan. Therefore, the Gold Yuan Coupon was quite popular at that time. At that time, if anyone had silver dollars to exchange for a large amount of Gold Yuan Coupons, it was very difficult, especially small change of less than 50 cents was more valuable. On the contrary, five-yuan coupons were not popular because they were inconvenient to use. After two months, the legal exchange rate of two Gold Yuan Coupons for one silver dollar was invisibly raised to three or five yuan. By the end of last year, it had become 30 yuan for one silver dollar. Five-yuan and larger banknotes were not worth one, only one-yuan coupons were the apple of one's eye. In the Gangu market, exchanging large banknotes for one-yuan small banknotes was worth less than half. On February 20 this year, Gold Yuan Coupons worth less than one yuan were suddenly rejected, and the value of silver dollars rose from 30 to 40, 50, and even 140 yuan. In the past few days, it has risen wildly to 200 or 300. So people call the Gold Yuan Coupon "overnight sorrow." In the past few days, it has risen wildly to 1,800 again, and now it has risen to more than 2,000. As a result, the Gold Yuan Coupon has lost its effect, and silver coins made in Sichuan have appeared, and prices have fallen sharply: 700 qian per catty of oil, 100 qian for a steamed bun. How many Gold Yuan Coupons exchange for one silver dollar, many people don't pay attention. A new exchange rate is naturally generated: one silver dollar is exchanged for eighty copper coins (that is, eight strings), which makes people feel like they are in another world.

Letter

We have received a letter from Mr. Jiang Dayi of the Shanghai Museum regarding the article on the ancient tombs in Changzhou, with some clarifications. We now transcribe it as follows: "In the article "Ancient Tombs in Changzhou Ready to Be Excavated" by Mr. Li Tianxing, a reporter stationed in Changzhou for your newspaper on the 5th, a rubbing of a tomb brick is attached, with ancient coin patterns on the brick, and the four characters on the coin, Yun Dayi, were interpreted as "Daquan Wubai". According to: The ancient tomb bricks in Changzhou vary in shape and size. The brick that Dayi saw in Shanghai (that is, the one seen by your newspaper's reporter Mr. Yuan Wenzhong) had extremely blurred decorations, and the four characters on the coin did vaguely resemble "Daquan Wubai". Later, in Changzhou, he saw two types of models, and the characters on the ancient coin, except for "Wu" An, were unrecognizable. Dayi once said that they

Regarding the Future of Housing in the World by Chu Zhonglu
According to statistics, the population of the Earth is already quite dense, and it increases by about two million people every month. At this rate, in two thousand years, there will only be standing room for humanity on Earth, making it difficult to turn around. This, while not directly affecting our generation, isn't it an extremely serious threat to our descendants hundreds of generations from now? Actually, it's not. Because, according to my thinking, the housing problem of mankind, with the development of science and the needs of reality, still has great room for development. The following are some of my thoughts:

(1) In metropolises on land, the population becomes very dense, with each building having at least dozens of floors, and the streets also have dozens of layers, which can accommodate a very large number of citizens. Airplane fields are also built on the rooftops.

(2) On the edges of the land, countless projects similar to the Dutch land reclamation technique are completed, providing housing for many people.

(3) At the same time, a world is also excavated underground, and their living conditions are the same as the residents of the basement floors of buildings.

(4) Due to the development of the shipping industry, in the future, many people will definitely live on sea ships for life, the same as fishermen who live on fishing boats for life now. Furthermore, many people will build extremely large floating docks. These docks are moored on the edges of the ocean, forming cities similar to Venice, with high-rise buildings built on them, housing many residents. In addition to living on the water, people will also live underwater, with underwater roads. The houses they live in will be very similar to modern submarines.

(5) There will also be many people living in the air, because at that time, airships and airplanes will be able to freely park in the air, no different than boats parking in the water.

(6) At that time, the Moon and Mars will definitely have human settlements, and there will definitely be traces of humans on other planets. Interplanetary transportation will also be very frequent.

Regarding the future food problem: Human food, generally speaking, comes from plants, and plants mainly rely on the photosynthesis of their chlorophyll. The success of artificial chlorophyll is thought to be just around the corner. After success, we can stop being parasites of the plant kingdom. Artificial chlorophyll can also be further processed. According to the same principle, we can also make artificial fruit trees, growing delicious, seedless fruits.

In addition, there is an inexhaustible amount of atomic energy released, sufficient to meet the needs of all of humanity's industrial power.

Therefore, no matter how much the population increases, or how advanced medicine becomes, or how much human lifespan is extended, humanity will always move towards the path of prosperity, and will never reach its end. Everyone, rest assured!

Be Calm First by Fang Zhou

People are constantly exposed to unexpected misfortunes. Especially in these times of war and chaos, with criminals everywhere, and all order thrown off track, various preventable and unpreventable disasters can happen to you at any time. Once misfortune strikes and puts you in danger, if you don't know how to control yourself and are just blindly afraid, then you can only sit and wait for death. On the other hand, if you can face danger and remain calm, calmly deal with the impending crisis, maybe you can turn danger into safety and save yourself. Here are a few examples.

In a crowded theater, a magician was performing on stage. As the audience was enjoying the show, the theater owner suddenly ordered the front-of-house manager to lower the curtain. At the same time, he took a bundle of hemp rope, walked to the stage, and said to the audience, "Have you all heard of the Indian rope trick? A rope is thrown into the sky and stands straight up. A child then climbs up the rope, higher and higher, until he disappears. Now, I will perform the rope trick for you. But I won't perform it on this stage, because here you will suspect that I am cheating. Now I will perform in the middle of the street. Please start from the last row and walk to the middle of the street in order. Okay? Thank you!"

Two minutes later, all the audience had walked out of the theater, and at this time, the fire at the backstage had reached the curtain.

The theater owner's calmness not only saved himself but also saved hundreds of lives. Otherwise, the scramble, the trampling on each other, the blocking of the doors, the consequences would have been unimaginable. The effect of calmness is so valuable.

One day, a family of three - father, mother, and son - were driving out in a car when suddenly, the car overturned into a river twelve feet deep. At that time, many people were standing on the riverbank, and they all shouted in alarm. Soon, the car sank to the bottom of the river.

"Don't try to get out!" the father shouted in the car. "Don't move, breathe less, the people on the shore will come to save us!" Luckily, all the car doors were closed tightly, and water did not pour into the car.

A quarter of an hour later, a few divers came down and rescued them.

When dealing with danger, calmness is paramount. May we all remember it well.

Qingming by Chen Zuogao
The wind sways the imperial willows, and the dark rain melts the soul. Unknowingly, it is again the time for Qingming tomb sweeping. Customs have been passed down, and great importance is attached to worshiping, sweeping, and burning paper money. However, in today's era of expensive rice and jade-like fuel, the cost of paper money requires tens of thousands of gold yuan. Whether rich or poor, most families have cut back. If ghosts have spirits, they will be overwhelmed with a sense of "This is already beyond hope, what can be said?"

In the past, the customs in Zhejiang generally involved sweeping the graves for more than ten days around Qingming, burning paper money, and hanging paper money on the graves. Various local chronicles record the same practice. For example, the Jiaxing Prefecture Chronicle of the Wanli period states: "...during Qingming, hang paper money on the graves." The Ningbo Prefecture Chronicle of the Jiajing period states: "...during Qingming, each family prepares green cakes, black rice, and sacrificial offerings to worship at the tombs, covering the soil, and hanging paper money on the top..." The Xi'an County Chronicle states: "...on Qingming Day, go to the tombs to add soil, prepare sacrificial offerings, and hang paper money..." On this day, people in the coastal areas also insert willow branches on their doors and eat green rice cakes, which is also a custom in Zhejiang. For example, the Taizhou Prefecture Chronicle states: "...during Qingming, gather green grass and mix rice flour to make food, called Hanshi." The Jinhua Prefecture Chronicle states: "...on Qingming Day, families insert willow branches on their doors, and young and old go to the suburbs, called Taqing (spring outing)."

During the Qingming season, tin foil is most suitable for adorning the scenery, and in recent years, some people have even profited from hoarding it. For example, at the beginning of the issuance of the gold yuan coupon, the wife of a certain painter from Biling, who had just lost her husband, obtained a certain amount of gold bars as inheritance. Fearing the law, she exchanged them all. However, fearing the depreciation of the currency, she consulted a certain tycoon and hoarded all the tin foil. Recently, with the price of tin foil soaring, she exchanged it back for gold bars, an increase of 40-50% compared to before. Based on my speculation, the number of people hoarding ghost money is likely not limited to that woman. Advocating superstition, are they also among the "those who first made burial figures"? At a time when people's livelihoods are declining and suffering prevails, if the money spent on paper money by residents in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas is used for social welfare undertakings, then gathering small things can make a big difference, and it would be a small help. Moreover, why must one adhere to formalities when being careful about the end of life and pursuing the past? If, during the cold season, one continues to inherit their aspirations, promotes their career, and commends their hidden virtues, wouldn't it be a double win, and more meaningful?

### Philippine Envoy to Korea Arrives in Shanghai: Gave a Press Conference Yesterday, Will Stay for One or Two Weeks to Visit Factories

[Our Newspaper] Mr. Gregorio, the Philippine Special Envoy to Korea, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday at noon after passing through Tokyo. Yesterday, he told reporters that his trip was not only to strengthen friendly relations between the Philippines and Korea, but also to take the opportunity to inspect the industries of China and Japan, especially the textile industry. The Philippines has a long-term plan for industrial construction, so it is eager to visit neighboring countries for reference. He will stay in China for one or two weeks and make full use of his time to visit factories in the city and inspect general conditions. As there are no daily flights between Nanjing and Shanghai, and due to time constraints, he may not go to Nanjing.

Mr. Gregorio said that Japan has suffered severely from war damage, but the mystery of its industrial recovery far exceeds our imagination. Someday in the future, Japanese goods will be dumped on the world market again, especially textiles. If Japan can restore its pre-war industrial investments in mainland Asia and Taiwan, its recovery speed will be even more astonishing. He hopes that the Far Eastern Commission can make a decision on this point. During his stay, he will pay close attention to the issue of compensation. We should learn from Germany's experience after the First World War, that is, a country should become economically strong. The special envoy expressed great concern about the situation in our country, repeatedly asking whether the ceasefire order had become a reality. Regarding the CCP's demand to control Shanghai, he believes it is inevitable, and whether peace talks will be successful depends on how much the government can accept the CCP's demands. When reporters asked about his views on the proposed Pacific Pact, the special envoy said that the Philippine Foreign Minister had already expressed his views on this matter, which can be regarded as the official attitude towards this matter. The Philippines, both the government and the public, have a fairly consistent view on this matter, that is, Japan should not be included in the pact. In a few years, Japan's affairs should not and cannot be decided by itself.

### Ministry of Communications Decides to Restore Railway Subsidy System: Freight Rate Increase Rate Will Be Greatly Reduced, Both Railway Bureaus Can Get 7 Billion in Subsidies in April

[Our Newspaper] When the revenue and expenditure of railways nationwide are not balanced, the Ministry of Communications requests the national treasury to subsidize them. However, since January of this year, the National Government has cancelled the railway subsidy policy in order to tighten national treasury expenditures, and each railway has adjusted freight rates based on its own costs, living within its means. As a result, passenger and freight rates on all routes have been adjusted frequently in the previous and current months, and the multiple of increases has also been significant. The general public and public school teachers feel overwhelmed. The Legislative Yuan has repeatedly opposed such high railway freight rates. In order to comply with public opinion and reduce the burden on passengers and merchants, the Ministry of Communications has reduced the freight rates adjusted on April 1 by two-thirds. After this reduction, the budget of revenues and expenditures of the railways are completely broken. A few days ago, the directors of various railway bureaus gathered in Nanjing to discuss the financial problems of each railway in the future. Finally, the Ministry of Communications decided to restore the subsidy system, and it is known that the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau will receive 7 billion yuan in subsidies in April. According to a senior official of the bureau, if this payment can be received immediately, it can barely be maintained in April. It is expected that after the restoration of the subsidy, the rate of increase in passenger tickets on both railways will be greatly reduced, and because passenger tickets are cheaper, passengers will inevitably support them more than before.

### Adjustment of Loading and Unloading Fees on Both Railways

The new prices for loading and unloading fees on both railways, adjusted from today, are as follows: luggage is 480 yuan per 50 kilograms, parcels are 102 yuan per 60 kilograms, livestock (pigs, dogs, sheep) are 98 yuan per head, large livestock is 293 yuan per head, cars, sedans, and coffins are charged at the original price plus 150 percent, and handling fees for small luggage are 580 yuan per piece.

### Shanghai Industrial Association Cables CCP, Urging North-South Trade: No Time to Delay

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Industrial Association believes that north-south trade is urgently needed. Yesterday, they cabled the CCP to appeal. The original text of the cable is as follows: "To Mr. Mao Zedong and Mr. Zhou Enlai of Peiping, You are deeply aware of the people's difficulties and have agreed to peace. Those engaged in industrial production are especially pleased to hear of the stability of people's livelihoods and economic prosperity. Trade between Shanghai and North China and Jiangbei has always been very frequent. This area's industrial products are exchanged for raw materials from the other side. The exchange of goods has a long history. Since last autumn and winter, however, transportation has been blocked and commerce has been interrupted, causing the production business in both places to shrink and decline. The industrial and commercial circles are deeply anxious. In order to maintain production, we plan to restore trade with Tianjin and exchange goods. The previous exchange of coal for flour is being processed, and matters such as navigation, communication, mail, and remittance are also being negotiated. If commercial affairs can proceed accordingly, it will benefit both the country and the people. The authorities here can agree in principle, and the specific measures are being studied. We dare to telegraph and earnestly pray for your adoption and vigorous support. The Shanghai Industrial Association, Chairman Du Yuesheng, respectfully."
