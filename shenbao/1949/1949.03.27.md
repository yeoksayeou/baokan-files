### Beginning of Peace Talks Set for April 1st in Beiping; Government Representatives to Depart Soon; CCP Representatives Finalized and Officially Announced

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 26th] Smooth progress has been made in the peace negotiations between the government and the Chinese Communist Party. The He Cabinet issued a statement on the 24th, appointing representatives and hoping that the CCP would immediately specify a time, location, and representatives. This was answered by the CCP's broadcast around 5 PM on the 26th, clearly stating that the negotiations would be based on Mao Zedong's eight conditions, with the Nanjing Nationalist Government as the negotiating party, and would be held in Beiping starting April 1st. The government's preparations have been actively underway in recent days. Huang Shaohong, one of the five representatives, is scheduled to fly from Hong Kong to Nanjing on the 28th. The delegation will also establish a secretariat, likely to be headed by Li Junlong. The government spokesman made no comment on the CCP's announcement of the time and location on the evening of the 26th. However, it is widely believed that the departure date of the government delegation will not be later than the 30th. Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Shizhao, and Li Zheng gathered again at the Ministry of National Defense at 10 AM on the 26th, presided over by He Yingqin, to discuss the military reorganization issues within the peace negotiation guidelines. The meeting ended in the afternoon. All four declined to reveal the contents, but it is said that the discussion was extremely thorough, fearing a repeat of the breakdown of negotiations in the 35th year of the Republic. Zhang Shizhao, a peace negotiation representative, told reporters on the evening of the 26th that he has always been optimistic because both sides need peace. Zhang also used philosophical words, saying: "The most serious matter is also the least serious matter." Zhang also believes that the battles nearing the Jiangbei bridgehead will not affect the progress of the peace talks.

[Our Report] A CCP Beiping Xinhua News Agency telegram broadcast at 6:10 PM on the 26th stated: "This station is instructed to announce that regarding the peace negotiation matters, the CCP Central Committee decided on the 26th that April 1st would be the starting time for the negotiations. The location will be in Beiping. The CCP representatives selected are Zhou Enlai, Lin Boqu, Lin Biao, Ye Jianying, and Li Weihan. Zhou Enlai will be the chief representative. The negotiations with the Nanjing delegation will be based on Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation of January 14th and the eight conditions he proposed. The above decision has been immediately notified to the Nanjing side through radio broadcasts, instructing them to dispatch a delegation according to the above time and location, carrying the necessary materials required for the eight conditions to facilitate progress."

[United Press, Nanjing, 26th] A cabinet spokesman said on the evening of the 26th that Premier He will convene a meeting at 9 AM on the 27th to discuss plans for sending government peace representatives to Beiping before April 1st to begin peace talks. He said that Premier He is currently studying the CCP broadcast and will not elaborate on this.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 26th] After the CCP announced that it would begin peace talks with the Nanjing representatives in Beiping on April 1st, people here felt joyous. Official sources believe that this expression from the Communist side shows that the end of the Chinese civil war is in sight.

The above picture shows the five CCP peace negotiation representatives announced:

### A Bolt From the Blue During the Control Yuan Meeting: Yu Youren Resigns as President; Supervisory Committee Members Appoint Representatives to Return the Original Letter and Earnestly Urge Him to Stay

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 26th] Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, submitted a detailed letter to all Supervisory Committee members at the Yuan's general meeting on the afternoon of the 26th, requesting to resign from his position. The letter was read by Liu Zhe, the chairman of the meeting. All the members were shocked upon hearing the news, as if struck by a bolt from the blue. They immediately spoke up, unanimously expressing their desire to retain him, and promptly appointed members Liu Zhe, Yu Dechun, Tang Honglie, Gu Fengxiang, LÃ¼ Chao, Leng Baodong, Chen Hanzhen, Song Ying, Yang Qunxian, Cui Zhenhua, Qiu Niantai, Li Mengbiao, Cao Haosen, Liu Pingjiang, Li Zhengle, and Feng Yunxian, a total of sixteen people, to go to President Yu's private residence to earnestly persuade him to withdraw his resignation and return President Yu's letter of resignation. Liu Zhe stated first that everyone had been in high spirits since the start of the Control Yuan meeting, but unexpectedly, the President suddenly submitted his resignation, which was no different from dropping a bomb. Tang Honglie, Gu Fengxiang, Song Ying, Li Zhengle, and others also spoke one after another, saying that the Control Yuan was relying on the President's leadership, and that in today's difficult situation, the President should not suddenly have thoughts of resigning. Yu stated that his resignation had been decided long before the Control Yuan meeting began, and the reason he had not submitted it earlier was because he feared it would affect the emotions of his colleagues during the meeting. Now that the meeting has largely proceeded smoothly to its conclusion, he is submitting it specifically, asking his colleagues to select another capable person. As for his own resignation, it is not a passive expression, but because he feels that after resigning as President, he can contribute more to the country. The committee members talked earnestly at Yu's residence for 20 minutes, but Yu still did not withdraw his resignation. Finally, the Supervisory Committee members stated again that if the President did not withdraw his resignation, all the Supervisory Committee members would come to the President's residence to urge him to stay and would be willing to advance and retreat with the President. After saying this, they returned Yu's letter of resignation. Yu repeatedly said, "Cannot, cannot," and placed it on the table. Tang Honglie then returned the letter of resignation to Yu's hand, saying, "The President has withdrawn his resignation." When Yu was about to say something, Tang and others stood up and said goodbye amidst a chorus of "Withdraw your resignation," and told reporters waiting for news in front of Yu's reception room: "Reporters, the President has already withdrawn his resignation." The Supervisory Committee representatives then returned to the Yuan to report to the general meeting that they had returned the President's letter of resignation and that the President had withdrawn his resignation. All the Supervisory Committee members applauded enthusiastically upon hearing the news. However, according to Secretary-General Li Chongbao, Yu's intention to resign is very firm, and he is still continuing to request resignation. Yu's original letter of resignation is as follows:

Yu's Original Letter of Resignation:

"Respectfully, I, Yu Youren, have been entrusted with the position of President due to the trust of my colleagues. In the past eight months, the changes in national affairs have been great, the suffering of the people has deepened, and the work of this Yuan has become more arduous. Although I have exerted my utmost foolishness, I have not been able to provide any assistance. I know that I am old and often ill, and my strength and heart are far apart, so I cannot force myself to overwork. In the future, the promotion of peace and the reform of politics require a spirit of great benevolence and great courage to lead, which is not something that a confused and foolish person like me can do. I hereby submit this letter requesting to resign from the position of President, and I hope that my colleagues will prioritize the country and the development of the work, and will not blame me, Yu Youren, for avoiding difficulties. It would be fortunate and grateful if my request is granted. This is addressed to the entire committee of the Control Yuan's 38th Annual General Meeting, Yu Youren, March 26th."

Staying in Nanjing After Resignation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 26th] Yu Youren told our reporter on the evening of the 26th that his request to resign as President of the Control Yuan was because he saw that after resigning as President of the Control Yuan, he could contribute more to the country, and it was by no means a passive expression. As early as last year's election for President of the Control Yuan, Yu had already been unwilling to hold the position. The reporter asked if all the Supervisory Committee members are now retaining the President and expressing their willingness to advance and retreat with the President, and if they do not

### Draft Sino-Soviet Trade Agreement; Contents Divided into Two Parts; Both Parties Request Government Approval

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch of the 26th] Regarding the negotiations on the Sino-Soviet trade agreement, the draft is currently being submitted to both governments for approval. The content of this plan has attracted much attention. Our reporter recently learned the gist from a semi-official but absolutely reliable source. According to the person, the draft is divided into two parts: one is the Sino-Soviet Xinjiang Trade Treaty, and the other is the Sino-Soviet Xinjiang Economic Cooperation Agreement. The former focuses on technical issues related to trade, while the latter is a method for Sino-Soviet cooperation in the development of industrial and mining resources in Xinjiang, including oil, uranium, coal, iron, gold, silver, etc. in Xinjiang Province. When asked about the basic spirit of this plan, the answer was: Under General Zhang Zhizhong's consistent advocacy of good neighborliness and pro-Soviet sentiment, this agreement is absolutely equal and mutually beneficial, and insiders believe that it will be beneficial to the livelihood of the people of Xinjiang and Sino-Soviet friendship. When asked if this negotiation, if successful, could improve the special situation in Xinjiang (referring to the Yining side abandoning its confrontational attitude), the person replied: Of course!

### Supervisory Committee Member Proposes a Corrective Motion Regarding the High-Priced Sale of Silver Dollars to England; Requesting the Government to Formulate Other Effective and Powerful Measures

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 26th] Tang Honglie and Hu Wenhui, two committee members sent by the Control Yuan to investigate the Central Bank's high-priced sale of silver dollars in Nanjing and Shanghai, have submitted a corrective motion. The motion, after explaining the investigation process, stated: "The government's military and political expenditures are enormous, and income and expenditure cannot be balanced. Currency inflation and rising prices are inevitable results. If the sale policy is used to raise military expenses, the government's gold, silver, and material resources are limited, so how can it be sufficient to sustain this? If the sale policy is used to stabilize prices and combat speculation, its effect is also minimal. The reasons for this are approximately fivefold: (1) The people have lost confidence in the gold yuan notes. (2) General speculators are observant, technically skilled, and ruthless, and are also familiar with the official situation. All government measures cannot escape their clutches. (3) Various banks and money houses are united, all targeting the government. (4) Many military and political organs are established in Shanghai, and after a large amount of money is received, boxes of unused banknotes are transferred to the market and become speculative capital. Various banks and money houses often use the method of breaking up wholes into parts and consolidating parts into wholes to manipulate the gold and silver market. It is doubtful whether these firms and brokers have powerful figures as their backers. Based on the above individual reasons, the bank's sale policy is, rather thanæå»ææº, increasing speculative capital. The result is the opposite. As for the silver dollars sold on the 18th and 19th of March, the price was uniformly 7,000 yuan, which was lower than the market price in Shanghai on that day, but higher than Nanjing and other places. This stimulated price increases in various places, and it is inevitable that it will cause serious consequences. Moreover, the government's gold, silver, material resources, and foreign exchange are limited. Repeated sales will cause the treasury to become empty. The failure of Song Ziwen's gold sales policy can serve as a warning. In short, this dangerous method of the Central Bank, quenching thirst with poison and fighting fire with firewood, will not only fail to remedy financial difficulties and stabilize price fluctuations, but will also accelerate financial bankruptcy, increase speculative forces, and make prices in various places rise due to widespread speculation. Looking to the future, the crisis is great. A corrective motion is hereby proposed, requesting the Yuan to forward it to the Executive Yuan to quickly formulate other effective and powerful policy measures as a fundamental plan."

### It is Confirmed that There Are Only Fifty to Sixty Troops in Banqiao Town, Beitou

Most of Them Have Returned South

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 26th] On the 25th, a portion of the 97th Division stationed in Banqiao Town near Jiangning Town, under the guise of crossing the river to attack, suddenly turned north in Qiaolin Town in Jiangbei and defected to the Communist army. This news was confirmed by officials on the 26th, but the situation is not serious. The division commander, Wang Yanqing, is a graduate of the sixth class of the military academy and the fifteenth class of the Army University. He is a veteran cadre of the 18th Army, and his troops have always been known as elite, with excellent quality and unwavering loyalty. When Wang led his troops north, the various units discovered Wang's intention and returned south. Therefore, Wang only led his chief of staff, two deputy regimental commanders, and fifty to sixty soldiers and fled towards Wujiang. Banqiao Town is peaceful and the defense is very solid.

### Communist Offensive in Suburbs Halted; Navy and Army Cooperate to Keep Anqing Safe; Communist Army Attacks Macheng in Eastern Hubei But is Repelled

[Our Wuhu Dispatch of the 26th] Anqing City is safe. A small group of Communist troops that broke into the suburbs have been driven out by the defending troops. Naval artillery fire is supporting the military operations, and a division of Yang Gancai's troops has arrived to reinforce, and the situation has stabilized. This time, the Communist army attacked Anqing because the troops of the North China Central Headquarters and the troops of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters changed defenses and took advantage of the void, forcing their way into the suburbs of Anqing.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 26th] According to a telegram from the Navy Headquarters in Anqing at 8 PM on the 26th, Anqing City is still in the hands of the National Army, and the city is peaceful. The National Army is currently holding its original positions outside the suburbs against the Communist army. Xiwang Temple, which was captured by the Communist army, has been recovered by the National Army. Several naval patrol boats are stationed on the Anqing River surface, using fierce artillery fire to attack. The Communist army's offensive has been blocked and has made no progress.

[Our Hankou Dispatch of the 26th] The Eighth Pacification District has been transferred from Anqing to Jiujiang.

[Our Nanchang Dispatch of the 26th] According to Jiujiang News: Anqing is being firmly defended by the National Army. On the morning of the 25th, there were still merchant ships sailing downstream to Jiujiang, escorted by naval vessels. However, ships sailing east are required to dock and inspect at a set time, and the river surface is closed at night. Xia Wei will come to Wuhan to oversee the situation.

[Central News Agency, Guijia Hui, 26th] More than a thousand employees of provincial-level agencies in Anhui, led by Secretary-General Huang BanGeng, Director of the Civil Affairs Department Zhang Weixia, and others, left Anqing on the 25th and moved to Wuhu and Tunxi. Yang Lianggong, president of National Anhui University, also led more than 300 faculty members and students to move south. The students all carried their luggage on their shoulders and walked south. Although supplies are extremely difficult, their spirit is very good.

[Our Huangpi Dispatch of the 26th] Yesterday, a certain unit of the National Army increased its defense of Xishui. No large groups of Communist troops have been found in the territories of Guangji and Huangmei counties.

[Our Hankou Dispatch of the 26th] The situation in Central China, which changes rapidly, has not yet emerged from the delicate stage. However, judging from the current movements on various fronts, this situation of uncertain tension seems to be gradually becoming clearer. Macheng, which has long been controlled by the Communist army in eastern Hubei, was forced to launch another round of offensive and defensive battles on the evening of the 25th. The Communist army's offensive has clearly encountered setbacks. On the west side of the Pinghan Railway in central Hubei, the Communist Jianghan Column and a part of the Tenth Column attacked Changjiangpu in the southwest of Yingcheng and Dangmeng County in the northwest of Yingcheng from places such as Liujiagang in Yingcheng. The defending troops repelled all attacks.

[Our Changzhou Dispatch of the 26th] On the northern Jiangsu front today, except for a small skirmish caused by the National Army in the Shijiaqiao and Sanwenhe area of Zhenjiang strengthening the bridgehead fortifications and making a slight advance to the north, the remaining areas, including Longwokou south of the port, remain in a quiet state. The Southeast Column of the Communist Army north of Yizheng City has now moved south to the vicinity of Shierlicha.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch of the 26th] The authorities have decided to open Guazhou for one day on the 27th, free of charge, to evacuate refugees from the north and south.

### From the Money Shortage to Silver Coin Savings

â He Shiqi

Although the Gold Yuan has reached a point where no one cares for it, the issue of money shortage still shakes the entire society. This is because the Gold Yuan is still the current medium of exchange, which is why everyone feels the pain so acutely. In fact, the current money shortage is an inevitable product of excessive credit expansion. The authorities have neither a fundamental solution nor a way to stop the malignant inflation of the national currency, but they are doing everything they can to tighten issuance. Sleeping in this state of contradiction and anxiety, it is difficult for the amount of currency to meet actual needs, and the money shortage problem cannot be fundamentally resolved.

Credit expansion should be resolved by saving national treasury expenditures and tightening credit. Even if issuing is tightened temporarily, it is by no means a permanently good policy. Moreover, the bank owes the people debts, but does not have sufficient cash reserves. It is simply issuing "empty" bank drafts that cannot be cashed, which is not only unfair to the people who have to endure the unmentionable loss of discounts, but also inappropriate in terms of legal principles. What is especially ridiculous is that some banks even cleverly added horizontal lines to the bank drafts when they issued them, in order to use this as a reason to refuse cash payment. However, this is fundamentally illegal; because a bank draft is not comparable to a check. Its very nature is a Cahier's Order, stipulated as a voucher for cash payment. After searching through China's negotiable instruments law, no clause can be found that allows horizontal lines to be added to a bank draft.

Since the crux of the money shortage problem lies in the expansion of credit, it cannot be solved by simply issuing more currency. The Central Bank's recent method of issuing silver dollars is nothing more than avoiding the issuance of new currency and using silver dollars collected in the past to replace cash chips to relieve the temporary money shortage. However, this neglects some technical issues: First, the silver dollars issued by the Central Bank include Eagle dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Dragon dollars, Yuan head dollars, Sun head dollars, and miscellaneous dollars minted by various provinces. The fineness is not uniform, and the prices vary greatly. Judging from the situation in the market at that time, apart from the Yuan head dollar, which was priced above 7,000 yuan, the prices of other dollars were relatively small, even with a difference of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per coin. May I ask whether the people can bear this unexpected loss? Second, if the Central Bank really wants to maintain a listed price of 7,000 yuan per coin and allow silver dollars to circulate smoothly regardless of the edition, it must issue silver dollars on the one hand and find ways to collect them on the other. If it only issues and does not collect, may I ask who can afford such a loss? Furthermore, issuing silver dollars worth about 7,000 Gold Yuan each, the increase in chips must be imaginary. If the authorities cannot work hard to save expenses and tighten credit, then they must have a fundamental tool to shrink the overall currency and stabilize people's hearts in order to prevent the recurrence of money shortages.

Regarding the identity of silver dollars, since the authorities stipulated that silver dollars were allowed to circulate and be traded previously, and then issued silver dollars afterward, we have every reason to believe that it is a currency that runs parallel to the Gold Yuan. Although the authorities have not yet officially announced it, and the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau has even partially denied the currency status of silver dollars, if we look at the whole country, the general trend is that silver dollars have clearly become the main currency. In Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Kunming, Chongqing, Chengdu, Changsha, Hankou, Jiujiang, and various rural areas, which transaction is not conducted in silver dollars? Aren't the deposit and loan businesses of banks in Lanzhou, Kunming, Changsha, and other places using silver dollars as the unit? Aren't the Central Mint and the Gansu Currency Bureau rushing to manufacture silver dollars? Let us put aside the proposals of legislators such as Qiu Hanping, who represent public opinion, to issue silver dollars and silver dollar notes, and also put aside the governments of Yunnan, Sichuan, and other provinces recognizing silver dollars as currency (Shen Bao Chengdu 23rd telegram), and even put aside the silver dollar issuance proposal of the Chongqing Senate. Let us just say that the newly appointed Minister of Finance and President of the Central Bank, Liu Gongyun, is also planning to issue redeemable silver dollar notes to circulate at the same time as Gold Yuan? (Financial Daily, Nanjing Special Telegram, 23rd) Based on these many facts, we dare to say with certainty that silver dollars will definitely have the status of currency in the future.

In addition, there are now some scholars who, based on theory, oppose the circulation of silver dollars. They believe that the silver standard is an outdated monetary system in terms of monetary principles, and the price of silver is easily affected by fluctuations in the international market. However, they have ignored the potential circulation preference (Lipuidity Prefererence) of silver dollars. It is well known that the people in China today generally prefer silver dollars. Although the government has repeatedly tried to ban them from using them, it has never been effective, and has instead become more prevalent. This shows that their preference is by no means something that anyone can deliberately create. The facts are such that everything can only be accommodated to the facts, and guided by the situation. When it comes to preventing the involvement of international market fluctuations, it can be done by strictly restricting the import and export of silver. As for the issue of silver dollars and Gold Yuan circulating at the same time, there is no shortage of precedents to draw on. For example, the Goods Dollar advocated by Irving Fisher, the gold and silver bimetallic standard (Bemetalic Standard) prevalent in Europe and America before the nineteenth century, the old Mark and Landen Mark in Germany during the First World War, the ruble and Chervonetz after the Soviet Revolution, and the concurrent use of "taels" and "yuan" in the early Republic of China, all had non-negligible economic functions, and are very similar to the current situation in our country. In short, we do not oppose any theory, but theory should adapt to the environment to be effective. Otherwise, forcibly applying theories that do not suit the national conditions is not only like cutting your feet to fit your shoes, but also like "oranges turning into trifoliate oranges when transplanted north of the Huai River."

Then, silver dollar savings meet the urgent demands of all sectors at present. If the Central Bank wants to avoid being blamed and recover the silver dollars that have already been issued, why not follow this path to achieve the effects of regulating currency, shrinking currency, tightening credit, and stabilizing prices? Everyone knows that today, when the people have suffered from the disaster of currency inflation, who does not hope to obtain a tool that can maintain unchanged purchasing power to protect their own property? As long as the policies of our financial authorities are not fickle and repeatedly changed, and the silver dollar savings themselves do not fall into the same tragic fate as government bonds, gold savings, and US dollar savings, then the people's surplus purchasing power and the currency not needed by the social economy will inevitably return to the government's hands through savings. Furthermore, after the currency is withdrawn, the new currency will no longer need to be issued continuously, and the original currency in society can also be recovered successively. Is it not better for the government to use this huge amount of savings to make up for the deficit than to borrow foreign currency from abroad with collateral?

When handling silver dollar savings, a large amount of currency can be recovered. Then, will the situation of cash chips be more serious than it is now? Regarding this issue, I don't think it is necessarily the case. Because silver dollar savings are a relatively stable unit. It is not like the current Gold Yuan, whose value fluctuates. People deposit money in the bank, which not only earns interest but also does not need to bear risks. Who would be willing to leave cash at home? In this way, people will naturally not carry cash to do transactions, and bank deposits will not flow out without staying. The turnover rate of deposits will certainly not be as fast as it is now, and credit will naturally be tightened invisibly. Savings will naturally have a restraining effect on circulation chips. Furthermore, if a panic occurs in the market for cash, it will be sufficient to cope with it by releasing a portion of the absorbed cash or silver dollars to regulate it.

Finally, we believe that although the silver dollars currently issued by the Central Bank are disguised banknotes, because they have intrinsic value, their value will never depreciate along with the Gold Yuan. At best, they will be withdrawn and hidden as expressed by Gresham's Law. Therefore, I think there is no need to worry too much, but the government must quickly promote silver dollar savings at the present time when Gold Yuan and silver dollars are issued simultaneously, so that floating capital can obtain a proper destination. Otherwise, if the war does not stop for a day and production does not increase, no matter how many Gold Yuan or silver dollars are issued, it will be difficult to fill the social desire, and the money shortage problem will still be difficult to completely solve.

### U.S. Aid to China Deadline Extended: House Foreign Affairs Committee Passes Bill to February 15 of Next Year

[United Press Washington, 25th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a bill on the 25th to extend aid to China to February 15, 1950. This bill will allow the use of $58 million already allocated to China but not yet used in the new fiscal year. Without the extension, aid to China would end on April 2. This bill has been submitted to the House Rules Committee and will later be debated by the House. A similar bill is currently in the Senate, extending the Economic Cooperation Act to December 31, 1949, but Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Connally told reporters that he would accept an amendment to the bill to extend the aid to China period longer. Although it is difficult to say what the final form of this bill will be, observers believe that the bill will proceed smoothly and China will definitely receive assistance. Chinese people here are very pleased with this development.

[United Press Washington, 25th] Cleveland, the head of the Economic Cooperation Administration's aid to China program, said on the 25th that the House Foreign Affairs Committee's passage of the extension of the aid to China program to February 15, 1950, "is very good news, because without this bill, the aid to China program would end at midnight on April 2, cutting off the remaining funds in the rural reconstruction program and the material supply program."

Cleveland said: Roughly speaking, the US$58 million will be able to extend the material supply program by two or three months, while also extending the rural reconstruction program for more time. He said: "The fund for maintaining the staff of the ECA's China Division is also necessary during the period when they are needed to assist in the distribution of materials. Goods approved for purchase in June may not be shipped until August or September."

White Reggie's plan would be to declare Qingdao and the surrounding 80-mile area a non-war zone, and organize it from top to bottom on a commercial basis, develop resources, stipulate sufficient living wages, and enhance the rights of people at all levels. He said, "Once we establish an economic system supported by the people, no matter what the communists do, it will be insignificant, because they cannot coerce it."

### Chongqing Assembly Holds Economic Symposium: Advocating Regional Economic Independence, Liu Hangchen and Others Visit Zhang Qun for Detailed Discussions

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 26th] The Chongqing Municipal Assembly held a Southwest Regional Economic Symposium at 10:00 AM on the 26th. The original proposing member, Tu Chongguang, chaired the meeting, stating that to stabilize the Southwest, it should become an independent economic unit. The administrative offices within the jurisdiction of the Pacification Headquarters should utilize gold and silver, as well as un-transported grains, and retain a portion of national taxes as a reserve for redeeming silver-backed currency, issuing silver-backed notes that are valid in the five provinces and cities of the Southwest, and withdrawing gold yuan. Prominent economic experts from the Chongqing financial community participated enthusiastically, expressing their views. Liu Hangchen agreed with the concept of regional economy, but emphasized that the new financial measures should be independent from fiscal revenues and expenditures. He criticized the current problem as stemming from the indistinguishable nature of the currency used by the people and the government's military and political expenses. The Dean of the School of Business at Chongqing University, Zhen Bao Xian, believed that to cope with the widespread devaluation of gold yuan and in preparation for the possible blockade of the Yangtze River, a regional economy was indeed necessary. However, it should be officially named "Regional Monetary Economy" to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world. The five provinces and cities should use silver dollars as the unit of account for transactions and issue joint-venture notes and mint coins (including subsidiary coins) for use. Gold yuan could still circulate, with daily exchange rates posted by the Central Bank. Goods from outside the region would be traded in silver dollars or through barter. Furthermore, the salaries of central government agencies in the five provinces and cities should be paid in silver dollars to avoid confusion. Pan Yangshan advocated the issuance of commodity-backed circulation notes and hoped for a swift self-organization, as requesting the government to handle it was unlikely to succeed. Lan Zehui hoped that the Chongqing Central Bank would quickly release its silver dollar reserves to alleviate the currency shortage. The meeting adjourned. Liu Hangchen, Kang Xin Zhi, Kang Xin Ru, and others visited Qun to discuss the matter further.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 26th] Liu Hangchen stated on the 26th: (1) Zhang Qun invited him to return to Chongqing to organize a Southwest Financial Research Institution. (2) The Central Trust Bureau entrusted him to transfer nine tons of scrap copper from the Pacification Headquarters to Chongqing, but the purpose was not specified. (3) He had consulted with Liu Gongyun in Beijing and Shanghai, and Liu stated that 60 billion gold yuan had already been issued. Currently, one-third of the printing machines at the Central Printing Plant have been shipped to Taiwan, affecting banknote production.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 26th] Zhang Qun announced on the 26th: Some banks and businesses are engaging in the excessive issuance of cashier's checks, leading to a flourishing of premium fees (è²¼æ°´), stimulating prices, and affecting the financial situation. The national bank should uniformly issue cashier's checks and order all banks and businesses to recall their cashier's checks within a specified period to rectify the situation. Furthermore, the premium fee here on the 27th was 45%.

[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 26th] Prices in Rong (Chengdu) are soaring wildly daily. Gold, silver, cloth, yarn, rice, and hundreds of other commodities change prices multiple times a day.

On the 26th, rice was 48,000 per stone, silver dollars were 7,800, and pure gold was 780,000. Additionally, Yang Xiaoci, the manager of the Central Bank, resigned and was succeeded by Lu Dingzhong.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] Overseas Chinese here are deeply concerned about the heavy taxes levied by the Japanese government. Our delegation in Japan has submitted a memorandum to Allied Headquarters today, protesting the Japanese government's heavy taxation of the 7,000 overseas Chinese in Yokohama for last year. The memorandum states: Local overseas Chinese are willing to pay taxes to the Japanese government in accordance with the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission, but they must not be subjected to discrimination. They specifically urge Allied Headquarters to investigate this matter. Furthermore, the taxes to be paid by overseas Chinese in Yokohama last year were fifty times higher than the previous year.

Our delegation also suggested that the local military government pay attention to this matter and requested that Allied Headquarters instruct the Japanese government to abolish the deadline of April 7 for paying last year's taxes.

### Worsening Relations Between the Soviet Union and Iran: Closing of Three Consulates in Iran

[Reuters, Washington, 25th] Authoritative sources report: The Soviet government is in the process of closing its consulates in Tabriz, Mashhad, and Rasht within Iran. Due to strict censorship, this news has not yet been transmitted from Iran. According to diplomatic dispatches, the Soviet Union has been moving belongings from these three Soviet consulates, but the telegram did not specify whether this action constitutes the formal closure of the consulates.

Diplomatic circles believe that if the Soviet Union formally closes its consulates in Iran, it will soon demand that the Iranian government close its only consulate in the Soviet Union â the consulate in Maku. It is believed here that the Soviet Union's next move is connected to two aspects of the Soviet government's recent policies: (1) The Soviet Union is constantly putting pressure on Iran, accusing it of colluding with the United States and Britain. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson recently condemned the Soviet Union's behavior, and spokespersons for the U.S. and Britain simultaneously declared their deep interest in Iran's security. (2) The Soviet Union has recently decided to significantly reduce the number of foreign diplomatic personnel stationed in the Soviet Union, suspecting them of engaging in espionage activities. While people here are not willing to speculate on the Soviet government's actions, it is generally believed that diplomatic relations with Iran will probably not be severed in the short term, nor will its embassy in Tehran be withdrawn.

### New Leads in the Headless Dismemberment Case: Police Station Receives Two Tips, Secretly Processing, Significant Progress Expected Soon

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the headless dismemberment case on Jinji Road was discovered on the 21st, this reporter has been diligently collecting various clues, witnesses, and physical evidence related to the case until last night, and has been continuously publishing them. On the one hand, we provide faithful reports for our readers, and on the other hand, we also hope that all materials can help the authorities in their investigation. However, yesterday, this newspaper received a call from Chen Tiansan, a spokesperson for the police bureau, stating that the investigation work is now underway, and in order to maintain confidentiality and complete the arrest of the murderer and solve the case as soon as possible, he hopes that this newspaper will temporarily suspend continuous coverage of the case. The Changshu Police Sub-bureau, which is handling the case, has also instructed all officers in charge to proceed secretly and strictly prohibit disclosing any information to the outside world.

However, according to confirmed information obtained by this reporter, the police announced a reward for informing on Friday night, and yesterday afternoon, someone submitted two confidential reports to the Changshu Road Police Sub-bureau. These two letters will be of great help to the investigation of this case and were personally reviewed and decided by Sub-bureau Chief Cheng. It is believed that significant progress will inevitably be made as a result.

Furthermore, summarizing the various clues up to last night, the police bureau has been unable to sort them out, so the investigation work, although actively carried out by a large number of police personnel, is still in its initial stages. According to someone engaged in actual investigation work and with deep experience in criminology, the most important investigation route is to determine the identity of the victim. To date, the identity of the deceased is still unknown, and the bureau has not been able to confirm or deny whether the two cases are indeed related.

### An Experienced Discussion with a Surgical Authority

According to this reporter's conversation last night with a doctor in the city who is regarded as a surgical authority in China, under normal circumstances, without proper tools (such as a saw, sharp knife, etc.), the result of dismembering a corpse cannot be as neat and clean as the meat pieces in this case. According to the doctor, if the bones of the corpse have no knife marks, it can be determined that it must have been sawn apart. The surgical expert also said that under normal operating room conditions, it would take about three hours or more to dissect the corpse into thirty-two pieces if there were assistants and nurses available. If one person worked alone, it could take five or six hours to do it unhurriedly. Since the internal organs of the corpse have been removed and the meat pieces have been washed clean, it is possible that several people colluded, not just one person. In addition, questions such as the origin and size of the woman's jacket, whether there is mud on the package, and whether there are any other clues have not yet been reliably answered as of last night. According to police research, the oil bag that was used to wrap the body shows that the time before discarding was not too long. Therefore, it may prove that the address where the crime was committed must be not far from the Shandong Guild Hall, but current investigations have not been able to discover any missing men in the nearby area. The most intriguing thing about the dismemberment case is that the internal organs and head have never been found. If the murderer could hide or destroy the internal organs and head, then why bother to discard the other parts of the body in a non-secret place? According to an experienced investigator, the evasive words of Li Changan, the long-term worker at the Shandong Guild Hall (who discovered the discarded body on the morning of the 20th), are also a major mystery in the case. If Li's evasiveness is due to fear, then this psychology must have its reasons.

### The Realization of "Murder Will Always Be Revealed" Depends on the Assistance of Citizens and Newspapers

The aforementioned criminology expert also recalled that more than ten years ago, an international "suitcase corpse" case that shocked the city occurred in Shanghai. At that time, the victim was a young and beautiful Chinese woman whose body was stuffed into a suitcase and shipped to Nagasaki by the Nippon Yusen shipping line. At that time, Shanghai was still in the concession era. The organizers of the case mobilized all the detective personnel to track down the rickshaw or car that was transporting the suitcase at the time. After several weeks of investigation, the rickshaw was finally discovered through the assistance of a newspaper reporter and the mutual assistance association of rickshaw pullers. The case was solved based on this key discovery. From the rickshaw puller's mouth, they found the location of the crime and thus found the people who lived there and were missing. The investigators then arrested the main culprit in the case, the Portuguese RemÃ©dios. RemÃ©dios directly admitted that the suitcase corpse case was his doing and also admitted that it was a crime of passion due to jealousy. At that time, from the discovery of the corpse to the solving of the case, it took more than forty days. In the agonizing process of the investigation with no progress, the investigators always kept the Western proverb "Murder will always be revealed" in mind, calmly responded, and finally solved the case. According to the criminology expert, the dismemberment case investigation is still in its early stages. The investigation work will inevitably encounter many difficulties in the future. However, with the assistance of citizens and newspapers, the proverb "Murder will always be revealed" can be expected to be realized again.

### Mayor Borrows Cash to Pay Salaries and Allowances to Public Servants and Teachers: Determined to Pay in Full Before the End of the Month, Totaling Approximately 3 Billion

[Reported by this newspaper] The Finance Bureau is actively planning the salaries and allowances for public servants and teachers in the city for this month and is determined to complete the payment before the end of the month. The multiple will be 675 times, which is three times the 225 times in the middle of last month, meaning a total of 900 times will be paid this month.

The estimated total is quite large, approximately 3 billion. Qian Jianfu, Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau, stated that no matter how difficult the economic situation in the city is, efforts will be made to raise the employees' salaries and allowances in full and pay them before the end of the month.

According to statistics obtained by this reporter, after the announcement of the "Measures for Adjusting the Treatment of Central Government Employees," public servants and teachers in the city can adjust according to the monthly index multiple announced by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. This index is based on the local cost of living index. If we calculate based on this month's cost of living index of 1339 times, then the Mayor's base salary is 800 yuan, which is 158 yuan after the discount. Each month, he can receive more than 210,000 yuan. Bureau directors receive an average of more than 184,000 yuan, department heads receive more than 158,000 yuan, and staff members receive only more than 80,000 yuan. In addition to fixed salaries, those above the appointment level receive office expenses. It is understood that the Mayor's office expenses are about equal to the salaries and allowances of one and a half department heads, the Bureau Director's office expenses are equal to the salaries and allowances of one department head, and the department head's office expenses are equal to the salaries and allowances of one staff member. Ordinary staff members have nothing but salaries and allowances. What can be used to make up for this is the in-kind allocation, which is worth about 30,000 gold yuan. In addition, there are two dou of welfare rice, worth 10,000 yuan. The water and electricity subsidy is about 12,000 yuan.

### Mayor Personally Meets with Representatives of Municipal Primary and Secondary Schools: Responds to Three Requests, Really Unable to Further Increase Salaries

[Reported by this newspaper] Representatives of the Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Association and the Municipal Primary School Principals' Association met with Mayor Wu yesterday morning at 11:00 AM to propose three points: (1) Please ask the Mayor to dispel the intention of resigning and continue to serve in this difficult situation. (2) Please issue another 1,000 times salary before the 28th to alleviate the urgent need. (3) Please increase the operating expenses of each school to cover expenses. The Mayor personally met with them and responded to each point as follows: (1) He expressed gratitude for the kind intentions of retaining him, but stated that he was unable to continue serving due to his failing health. (2) Based on the actual municipal economic situation, he can only issue another 300 times the salary. Now, due to the repeated requests of the representatives of municipal primary and secondary school teachers, he has tried his best to raise funds and decided to issue another 675 times the salary on the 30th and 31st of this month. It is really impossible to handle the request to increase it again. In addition, the welfare rice for April will be issued in advance, which will also provide a lot of assistance to teachers and staff. (3) It is true that the operating expenses of each school are not enough to cover expenses, and he is currently studying ways to increase them.

[Additional News] The Municipal Primary School Teachers' Association is scheduled to hold a representative conference at 1:30 PM on the 29th at the Municipal He'an Primary School on Xinza Road to discuss the matter of going to Nanjing to petition for improved treatment and to urge the payment of outstanding allocations of oil, coal, and other in-kind items.

### Agreed Upon Overdraft Funding for National Schools: Disbursement at 900 Times the Standard Within the Week as Advance Payment of Next Month's Salary

[Report from our newspaper] The public and education sector's cost of living index has not yet been released. With skyrocketing prices and no solution to the salary problem, public and education personnel are facing severe threats to their livelihoods. Faculty and staff salaries at national universities in this city were disbursed at 75 times the standard for February. At the beginning of March, the Ministry of Education disbursed at 500 times the standard, which the professors' association considered to be a supplementary payment for February, after which no further funds were disbursed. To date, school funding and the living conditions of faculty, staff, and students have reached a point of exhaustion and are unsustainable. Yesterday morning, the presidents of various national universities in this city, including Zhang Yi, Wang Zhizhuo, Xia Jianbai, and Zhu Guozhang, jointly went to the Central Bank to negotiate the issue of overdraft funding. Because the Ministry of Education is far away in Guangzhou, it is difficult to determine the overdraft standards. After discussing with Lin Chongyong, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, it was temporarily agreed to overdraft at 900 times the standard of 819, to be disbursed within this week. After receiving these funds, the schools will disburse faculty and staff salaries at 900 times the standard as part of an advance payment for April salaries.

According to the presidents, the current student public expenses, the basic salaries of manual laborers, and the basic salaries for professors' academic research have all increased. Therefore, when the Central Bank overdrafts at 900 times the standard of 819, the amount disbursed by the schools according to the current basic salaries only amounts to slightly over 700 times the standard. The school presidents still need to find other ways to make up for the shortfall. Currently, the professors' association believes that March salaries have not been disbursed at all, while the school presidents believe that 75 times the standard was disbursed for February and 500 times the standard was disbursed for March, but both are awaiting supplementary payments according to the index. This issue urgently awaits a comprehensive solution from the central government.

### Zhang Xueqin Files Another Private Prosecution Accusing Li Ming and Others of Fraud and Assault: Testifies in Court About Being Deceived, Emotionally Agitated and Near Collapse

[Report from our newspaper] The case of Zhang Xueqin, the sister of Zhang Naiqi, one of the Seven Gentlemen, regarding the marriage dispute with Dr. Li Ming, after Zhang's accusation and prosecution of Li for the crime of assault, was concluded by the District Prosecutor's Office, which decided not to prosecute. However, Zhang filed a private prosecution with the District Court, accusing Li Ming and the Civil Defense Captain Chen Xiangxiong, Chen Zhu Shi, Shu Hongfang, Zhao (female), Yang Yueying, and others of fraud and assault. The complaint briefly states: In October of last year, due to suffering from high blood pressure, she sought treatment from Li Ming. Li immediately took the opportunity to be solicitous and generously gifted her with medicine. On the 14th of the following month, Zhang's birthday, Li again presented gifts to celebrate and proposed marriage after conducting an investigation. On the anniversary of her mother's death, Li again visited her home to pay respects. That evening, he proposed marriage to her and asked to cohabitate in advance, which she refused. Li then requested to hold an engagement ceremony during the upcoming Lunar New Year. He then drafted a "revolutionary marriage contract," but because Li insisted on including a clause in the contract stating that the man could "take a concubine," which she could not accept. Later, Li took the draft back. She then fell ill and was unable to get up. After further investigation, she learned that Li was already married. In order to protect her own future happiness, she went to Li's home on March 1st to retrieve the marriage contract. Unexpectedly, this angered him, and he incited Chen Xiangxiong and others to assault her. Li also said that she would have to prepare a large sum of money before he would agree to return the marriage contract.

The case was initially tried in court yesterday by Judge Mei Erhe of the District Court. The defendants Li Ming, Yang Yueying, and Chen Xiangxiong appeared in court to respond. Zhang, who suffers from heart disease, became very emotional while testifying in court about being deceived and nearly collapsed several times. After questioning the defendants, the court decided to conduct further investigation and reschedule the trial.

### Defendants in the San Shen Zhuang Hoarding Case Acquitted

[Report from our newspaper] Lai Jinting was the operator of the Fuchang Shen Zhuang Relief House, which was engaged in the sugar business. The manager of the Zhuang, Zheng Wenjian, resided in Fujian for a long time, and Lai was responsible for the Zhuang's operations in Shanghai. Between July and August of last year, he successively purchased and stored 100 bolts of rubber tweed and 24 bolts of fancy bi ji. Cai Zhengfa was a runner for the Hongli Shen Zhuang Relief House. The manager of the Zhuang, Lin Zhaoping, resided in Fujian, and the deputy manager, Liu Shougong, was responsible for all operations in Shanghai. On September 4th, 16th, and 17th of last year, Cai separately purchased and stored twelve pieces of white native cloth, each piece containing fifty small bolts, and one hundred bed covers of Duofu brand. Lai Chunzao was the operator of the Jinhe Shen Zhuang Relief House. The manager, Yang Jie, went to Fujian on August 15th of last year. Lai purchased twelve pieces of eight white native cloth, each piece containing fifty small bolts, and two pieces of printed native cloth bed covers, one with one hundred and fifty small bolts and one with one hundred and sixty small bolts, between August 30th and September 16th. Because the above Zhuang purchased and stored large quantities of important daily necessities as non-businessmen, hoarding for profit, they were seized by the Yimiao Police Precinct and sent to the court for trial. The District Court has held several hearings and summoned the defendants. The defendants argued that the items stored were all purchased on behalf of customers in Fujian. Due to the uncertain shipping schedule between Fujian and Shanghai, they had no choice but to purchase and store the items in advance, waiting for the ships to transport them to Fujian. Moreover, the items purchased were all native cloth, with special export permits from the customs, which could be used as evidence. Yesterday, Judge Ruan Qin of the District Court concluded the trial in court and pronounced the defendants not guilty.

### Economical Smokeless Stove to Be Launched in the Short Term: Experimenter Xu Uses About Sixteen Pounds of Coal for Cooking and Boiling Rice All Day; Still Some Shortcomings Being Studied and Improved

[Report from our newspaper] "Economical Smokeless Stove," what an alluring name! In today's China, when electricity cannot be fully utilized, most families rely on coal stoves for cooking, baking, and boiling water. Therefore, every household has a large or small coal stove. However, coal stoves have two shortcomings: (1) the coal gas is too heavy, and (2) too much coal is consumed. These two problems are being solved by the Central Industrial Experiment Institute. Yesterday, a reporter visited the institute and conducted a detailed investigation of the design principles, construction, and usage methods of the economical smokeless stove. Here is a report:

The purpose of the stove is to directly burn inexpensive bituminous coal, allowing for complete combustion without smoke and fully utilizing the coal's thermal energy and waste heat to improve the stove's combustion efficiency. Other fuels such as firewood and anthracite coal can also be used in this type of stove with good results.

How can this goal be achieved? When bituminous coal burns in the stove, it must have four key elements:

Economic Smokeless Stove Design Diagram

(1) Sufficient air supply, (2) close mixing and contact between air and combustible gases, (3) maintaining the firebox at the ignition temperature of coal gas, (4) sufficient residence and combustion time. The design principles of the stove are relatively complex and will be omitted. Let's first talk about the structure and usage of the stove:

(1) When starting a fire, first place a small amount of firewood and paper on the rocking grate (see K in the appendix) and light it. After about three minutes, add a small amount of coal on top. After 15 minutes, the coal fire will be vigorous, and then place another part of the coal on the inclined grate (J).

(2) The coal on the grate (K) is mixed and combusted with the primary air entering through the ash door (I) and the secondary air entering through the (L) door, which helps combustion. This secondary air is preheated by the high temperature of the firebox when passing through the jacket wall (M), increasing combustion efficiency.

(3) The coal on the grate (J) is completely and slowly distilled by the air entering from the coal adding door (H), a part of the main air entering from the ash door, and the high temperature radiated by the firebox, so that all the volatile substances in the coal are slowly distilled out and mixed with the preheated air flowing downward from the jacket wall (M), resulting in complete combustion without smoke.

(4) The high-temperature combustion gas first comes into contact with the pot (A), the boiling water tank (B), and the soup pot (C) to reach a sufficient temperature for stir-frying dishes, boiling water, and simmering soup. It also lightly passes through the hot water tank (F), using its residual heat to heat the water. At the same time, the left side and the upper part of the baking oven (E) are heated by the transfer of high-temperature radiant heat, so that the internal temperature is sufficient for baking bread and keeping vegetables warm in winter. The flat top (D) on the upper right of the stove can be used to place the necessary utensils in the kitchen when cooking.

(5) When removing ash, simply use a long hook outside the ash door (I) to rock the grate (K) back and forth, allowing the coal ash to automatically fall into the ash chamber. At the same time, the coal that has become coke on the inclined grate falls onto (K) and continues to burn. Fresh coal can be added to the upper part of the inclined grate to continue its distillation effect. The small holes in the inclined grate are conical with a small top and a large bottom, so that even crushed coal will not clog.

(6) When keeping the fire burning slowly, simply add a thin layer of wet crushed coal to the upper part of the coal fire, close the partition (not shown in the diagram) at the bottom of the chimney, and close the air vents of the coal adding door and the ash door, and close the air vents of the secondary air door (L), so that it can be kept burning overnight.

(7) The method is the same when burning firewood.

After the design was completed by the institute, it underwent several experiments, and the results were very satisfactory. In the first experiment, bituminous coal was continuously burned for eight hours without smoke. The amount of coal burned was three pounds per hour. In the second experiment, bituminous coal was still used for actual household stir-frying and cooking, with intermittent experiments. The fire was stopped when not in use, and coal was added for testing when needed. In this way, only sixteen pounds of coal were used all day. In the third experiment, firewood was used, and about twenty-two pounds of firewood were used all day.

The designers of this economical smokeless stove are Gu Yuqun and Chen Xuejun. The institute's experimental work has been greatly affected due to insufficient funding. According to the person in charge of the institute, this coal stove still has some shortcomings and is being studied and improved, such as its size being too large (about the size of a small desk), making it inconvenient to carry and transport. Efforts are being made to reduce its size as much as possible without affecting combustion efficiency. After both the form and internal structure are deemed satisfactory, the stove design will be drawn up in the shortest possible time and mass-produced for launch.

Reporters from various newspapers held a banquet last night on the fourth floor of the City Bank to welcome Mayor Chen, Secretary-General and the new and old directors of each bureau. The illustration shows the mayor talking with a group of female reporters. (Photo by our newspaper)

### The Reign of the Gè¢ Brothers: A Land Dispute in Chongqing

â Lai Gong

[Chongqing, 21st Dispatch] During this time of unrest, Chongqing seems to be under the reign of the Gè¢ brothers. They openly kill people and then start legal battles with the courts. This case originated from a land dispute involving the Chongqing World Buddhist Fellowship Association. Caught between the Gè¢ brothers and the Fellowship, Xie Dezhi sacrificed his life on behalf of the Fellowship. The Xie family has resided in Chongqing for a century, and his late father was widely praised for his peaceful charity. He passed away just two years ago at nearly ninety years old. Xie himself was in his fifties this year and had more than ten children, all studying at the university, middle and primary school levels. He was currently the only expert in Chongqing capable of authenticating jewelry. Throughout his life, he was enthusiastic about public welfare and devoted to Buddhism. Since joining the Fellowship, he spared no time or money to assist with its affairs. The chairman of the Fellowship was Pan Changyou, the vice-chairman was Du Minying, and other directors included Ju Zheng, among others. Xie also served as one of them, holding the position of director-general.

The predecessor of the Fellowship's land was the Dongyue Temple, which was leveled by enemy aircraft during the Anti-Japanese War. Neighboring residents then expanded their properties. The Yichuan Theater nearby occupied a large portion. Time flies, and it has already been ten years. After the government returned to the capital, the Fellowship decided to build the Lotus Master Hall, bringing up the old matter and demanding the return of the land. This matter was entrusted to Xie, who was both a director and the director-general. Xie verbally urged the residents to move out without success and was then assigned to be responsible for filing lawsuits. Finally, they won the case completely. Unfortunately, almost all of the residents were local Gè¢ brothers, and several were leading figures. As a result, even after four attempts to enforce the court's decision, there were no results. For Xie, he couldn't please either the Gè¢ brothers or the Fellowship. On the Gè¢ brothers' side, this incident planted the seeds of his death. They believed that everything was Xie's sole initiative and that the entire process disregarded their face, affecting their usual lawless social standing. They tried every possible way to retaliate against him personally. The wealthy and powerful Yichuan Theater took on the responsibility of leading this retaliation. The chairman of Yichuan, Jiang Xiangchen, was a city councilor. The general manager, Dai Kunyuan, was a retired regimental commander. The deputy manager, Mou Dezhang, was a major shareholder. The owner of the Li family opera troupe, Li Shizhi, which was currently performing martial arts operas and Beijing operas at the theater, was a pillar of the underworld. Among these four, the main perpetrator, Dai Kunyuan, was skilled in martial arts. He originally served under Yang Sen and later defected to Fan Shaozeng. After Fan retired, he also lost his job. During his time in the military, he was known as "Hairy Bull" due to his crude and unreasonable nature. He now had a large number of former soldiers from Fan's army under his command, as well as the double qualification of being a Gè¢ brother. He was the most influential bully in Chongqing. As a result, the title of manager of Yichuan fell on him. This lineup was already a significant threat to Xie. Unexpectedly, Dai and Mou stepped forward and either went to Xie's house to threaten and insult him or directly broke into the Fellowship during lectures to create disturbances. They also sent messages through others, declaring that they would kill Xie. Xie was very frank, but at the urging of friends and relatives, he went to other provinces several times to avoid them for some time. Not long after Xie returned home this time, Yichuan suddenly sent someone to plead with Xie, willing to voluntarily relinquish the occupied land and lease other land. However, after the lease procedures were completed, the theater not only did not vacate the original site but also supervised workers to build dormitories for the Li family troupe on the land that had just been reclaimed by the Fellowship and had the foundation stones laid. This was obviously making things difficult for Xie, but Xie only dared to be angry and did not dare to speak out.

On February 14th (the 17th day of the first lunar month), Xie went to the Fellowship at 4 PM as usual to listen to Buddhist scriptures. Soon after he sat down, residents Xu Jinxiu and Wang Yinchang barged into the lecture hall, urging Xie to come outside, saying they had something to discuss. They pushed and dragged him to Xu's house. Suddenly, shouts and beatings erupted. The front door was blocked off. The main perpetrator, Dai Kunyuan, first grabbed Xie's collar with his left hand and slapped Xie's ears twice with his right hand. Then, he continuously struck Xie's left temple and ear roots. Xie just clasped his hands and said, "Grandpa Dai, please spare me." Another main perpetrator, Mou Dezhang, jumped out and tightly grabbed Xie's hands, kicking Xie's lower body violently. The other accomplices punched and kicked, competing to strike. The commotion and groans alarmed the two workers outside the room. Realizing something was wrong, they ran to the lecture hall and screamed for help. By the time the people listening to the scriptures dragged Xie to the lecture hall, he was half-dead. Unexpectedly, the perpetrator Dai Kunyuan led the crowd to follow and shouted to kill him. The fellow devotees bowed and clasped their hands, begging bitterly, before they stopped. At this time, Xie was unable to speak. The fellow devotees saw the situation and feared for his life, so they accompanied him to the court to report the case and have his injuries examined. After returning home, both Chinese and Western doctors diagnosed bleeding from blood vessels in his head, and everyone was helpless. The hospital also refused to admit him because his injuries were beyond cure. During this period, Dai, Mou, Jiang, and others formally sent people to Xie's house to inquire if he was dead. His family was disturbed and uneasy. The patient already felt complete numbness on the left side of his body. So, they asked for favors again and barely managed to send him to Kuanren Hospital. At 7 AM on February 21st, he died as a result of his injuries. His family temporarily moved the body to the Fellowship for viewing. The people of the Fellowship were moved to tears. They immediately hosted the press and drafted a complaint on behalf of the deceased's family, listing the perpetrators Dai, Mou, Jiang, and seven others as defendants. The deceased's family, dressed in mourning clothes, presented the complaint to the court, pleading with the judge to examine the body and detain the perpetrators. For a moment, the courtroom was filled with the cries of the deceased's family and the noise of the crowd. The judge ascended the bench and said to the deceased's family, "Since the plaintiff is dead, and the prosecutor's office has sent personnel to examine the body, the prosecutor will investigate and handle the case according to the law." Then, he immediately adjourned the court. The next day, the newspapers of Chongqing rushed to disclose the news, shaking the entire mountain city. After the deceased's family left the court, they expected someone to come to examine the body, but no one came. After inquiring at the court, they were told that someone would come tomorrow. The next day (22nd), they waited all day, but there was still no result. It was not until the third day (23rd) that the examiner came, but after a brief look, he did not fill out an injury form and slipped away timidly. The deceased's family was furious and hired someone to take four large photographs of the injuries. The left side of the deceased's face was completely black and swollen, unrecognizable. The left chest was severely injured and completely blue. The limbs all over the body were unevenly blue and purple. The scrotum drooped like a bowl, looking very miserable. On the 22nd, the perpetrator Dai and others, saw the news unfavorable to them published in the newspapers and panicked. They immediately set up more than twenty tables that day and invited all sectors of Chongqing, using the Gè¢ brothers' tone to smooth things over. Then, several leading figures came forward to purchase clothing, coffins, and burial items for the deceased, claiming that they were paying out of their own pockets as a third party. At the same time, they often went to Xie's house and tried to persuade them in both soft and hard ways, willing to raise living expenses on behalf of the deceased's family, as long as they withdrew the lawsuit and accepted reconciliation. The perpetrator continued to be the general manager, and the theater continued to open and perform as usual. The only difference was that the theater's gate often gathered many poorly dressed so-called demobilized soldiers, supposedly borrowing money to raise living expenses. Until the court moved the case to the criminal court for handling. At the next hearing, there was still no one in the defendant's dock. As a result, the court announced that the defendants had not been summoned and adjourned the court for another hearing at a later date. In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed. The deceased's family saw that the perpetrators were still flaunting themselves in the city. The deceased was not buried, and the living had no support. They dragged their children and went to the Women's Association to cry and complain. It just so happened that "March 8th" was approaching. In the afternoon, women and people from the Fellowship, who came uninvited, formed a marching team, led by the deceased's family holding the spirit tablet. They went directly to the Pacification Commissioner's Office, the Garrison Command, and the local court to submit petitions. They shouted slogans and posted leaflets along the way. On that day, almost everyone in the city used this matter as a topic of conversation. But strangely, all the leaflets were torn down as soon as they were posted, and torn down cleanly. Even stranger, this news that shook the whole city and directly knocked on the government's door was only vaguely mentioned in two newspapers the next day. With great difficulty, the court reopened the case at 3 PM on March 16th, but only interrogated the defendants. The court loudly summoned the names of the perpetrators Dai Kunyuan, Mou Dezhang, and others, but there was no response and no one was seen. Only the chairman of Yichuan, Jiang Xiangchen, the city councilor, and one or two others among the defendants came to the court to answer questions, while more than a hundred Gè¢ brothers who had come with them immediately filled the courtroom to the point where it was impenetrable. This tense scene ended within half an hour with an adjournment. Jiang was then led out by the Gè¢ brothers and calmly stepped into a private car, speeding away. It is said that the outcome of this case will depend on the court hearing on March 28th. Our reporter.

### Looking at Rural Western Sichuan: Discussing the Land Restriction Policy

â Our reporter Zhou Xueduan

[Chengdu Dispatch, 18th] With the turbulent situation and shifting public sentiment, political reform has become the unanimous demand of the people, especially land reform, which is the most pressing need at present. Last month, Zhang Cui returned to Chengdu and announced his governing principles, especially emphasizing the implementation of "land reform" as the focus of rebuilding the Southwest. Based on this, the Sichuan Provincial Government passed the "Sichuan Land Restriction Policy" last week, which may not be a brave and combative "revolutionary" action in today's Sichuan social environment.

Western Sichuan's Prosperity from Farmers' Blood and Sweat

With the warm spring blossoms, this reporter specially took a trip to the counties on the outskirts of Chengdu to investigate the real situation in the countryside. The Western Sichuan Plain is lovely. These days, spring has deepened, plants are thriving, the wheat fields are green, the vegetable patches are yellow, and the smoke-filled forests and villages are reflected in the distance. Farmers, both men and women, work hard in the fields. From now on, hardworking farmers have already begun to cultivate, and their blood and sweat are creating the warehouse of the Heavenly Kingdomâthe prosperity of the Chengdu Plain. These farmers are mostly tenants hired by landlords. They work hard all year round and find it difficult to get enough to eat. At the same time, due to years of civil war, heavy taxes and levies, even small and medium-sized landlords find it difficult to maintain their lives and are forced to sell their land, resulting in land concentration and the emergence of some new large landlords. According to accurate surveys: In the past ten years, the number of new landlords in the Western Sichuan Plain accounted for 71% of the total number of landlords and occupied 89% of the land. In Dayi, which has undergone the greatest changes, the number of new landlords accounted for 88% of the total number of landlords, occupying as much as 99% of the land.

Land Concentration and Farmers' Hardships

From the recent visits of reporters to a small number of counties, it was discovered some special phenomena in Western Sichuan land, such as the proportion of new landlords in Dayi; military landlords account for 2.9% of the households but occupy 66% of the land, averaging 4,000 mu per household, with the highest exceeding 40,000 mu; bureaucrat landlords account for 47% of the households and occupy 33% of the land, averaging 200 mu per household, with the highest exceeding 9,000 mu. Old landlords only have 12% left, occupying less than 1% of the land. For example, in Chongqing, the land of a certain new large landlord has an area that covers most of the county, 20 li long and 40 li wide. Statistics on Western Sichuan Plain land show that 60% has been transferred and concentrated in the hands of warlord landlords, and 30% is dispersed among bureaucrats, local tyrants, and evil gentry. The reason is that Western Sichuan's water conservancy is well-developed, and there are fewer droughts and famines. It is generally believed that land is the most reliable investment object. The illegal profits accumulated by warlords and bureaucrats over the years are concentrated on buying land. These large landlords have many fields and abundant financial resources. At the same time, they use various evil forces in politics and society to squeeze and bully all tenants to the extreme. The blood and tears of Western Sichuan farmers are a tragic and inhumane history.

Provincial Government Implements Land Restriction Measures

In order to meet the needs of the trend and address this fact, the Sichuan Provincial Government has formulated the "Sichuan Provincial Land Restriction Measures," with the main points: (1) A land restriction levy will be implemented on the area of land owned by private individuals or organizations throughout Sichuan. (2) The number of people in a household will be based on a family of five, and will be limited to permanent cohabitating family members. (3) The classification of fields will be based on an annual grain yield of 4 shi or more per mu for top-grade fields, 3 shi or more for medium-grade fields, and less than 3 shi for low-grade fields. And the upper, middle and lower level of land will also be classified based on an annual wheat yield of 1 shi and 5 dou or more per mu, 1 shi or more, and less than 1 shi. (4) The quota for farmland is that each household shall not exceed 50 mu of top-grade farmland, 70 mu of medium-grade farmland, or 200 mu of low-grade farmland. The quota for land is that each household shall not exceed 75 mu of top-grade land, 100 mu of medium-grade land, or 150 mu of low-grade land. (5) If the number of people in a household exceeds five, the quota will be increased by one-tenth for each additional person. (6) The excess land collected should be immediately re-divided and reorganized, and then granted to the people who will cultivate it, in the following order: (1) current cultivators, (2) original tenant farmers, (3) retired soldiers and families of active soldiers who have the ability to cultivate, (4) other farmers who have the ability to cultivate and need land. (7) The price of the excess land collected will be compensated in installments with a combination of land bonds and cash.

Western Sichuan Farmers are Generally Awakened

The implementation of the "Sichuan Land Restriction Measures" is a wise and timely move by the authorities today. Without going deep into the rural areas of Sichuan, one does not know the greatness of the Sichuan farmers. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and the three years of the civil war, Sichuan farmers shouldered arduous burdens for the country in terms of soldiers and grain taxes. Looking at the rural areas of Western Sichuan, reporters can understand the characteristic of the Chinese nation to strive for glorious survival through enduring hardship and resentment. They have never complained about fulfilling their national obligations by paying heavy taxes and levies, and serving in the army. However, the unreasonable concentration of land has led to the emergence of new warlord and bureaucratic landlords who use the evil forces of the old society, such as baojia, local tyrants, and Gè¢ brothers, to exploit the farmers. Sichuan farmers have silently endured this extremely harsh environment for decades. But the result of this contact proves that they have awakened. From the "25% Rent Reduction" to the "Land Restriction Policy," Western Sichuan farmers are generally actively striving for it. The measures promulgated by the Sichuan Provincial Government are just a move to follow the trend. If even this is lip service and not put into practice, the consequences will be difficult to predict.

Zhenjiang

[Our Report] After the tense situation in northern Jiangsu, the lower reaches of the Yangtze River were blocked, and the supply of grain from the north bank was completely cut off. In the past, most of the rice and grain in this county relied on large shipments from northern Jiangsu. The main grain-producing areas in northern Jiangsu that regularly supplied rice and grain to this county included Gaoyou, Douye, Yangzhou, and Taizhou, but now it only relies on the four rural villages. Apart from this, it relies on neighboring counties such as Jiangning, Lishui, Jurong, Jintan, and Danyang to maintain the supply, which is simply pitifully small. Sometimes, when the price of grain in Shanghai is high, rice merchants transport the rice to Shanghai for sale at high prices.

### Suzhou Orphanage Takes in a Stray Child for Five Years, Returns to Warm Home

â¦Another Harvest of Our Newspaper's Social Servicesâ¦

About half a month ago, this column received a letter from an unsigned reader, saying that there was an orphan Yan Genfa, 11 years old, who was tricked from Shanghai to Suzhou by a child trafficker five years ago. Later, he was questioned by the police, and the trafficker escaped. He was taken in by the Wu County Baptist Orphanage, but remembered that his father owned a flower shop in Shanghai and his mother had passed away long ago. He asked this column to try to visit his parents so that he could return to a warm home. After receiving the letter, this column immediately started the investigation work. We pursued the "fruit of service" with enthusiasm.

First, we learned from Dean Sheng of the private Wu County Baptist Orphanage at 56 Xieyaqian Street, Suzhou, that Yan Genfa was admitted to the hospital in the summer of 1944. He spoke with a Chongming accent. Initially, he was a beggar at the Chufang Bridge in front of Guanyao in Suzhou. He was very pitiful. Later, the owner of the nearby Huang Shuntai Hotel transferred him to Mao Shuyun, the owner of the Mao Shangzhen Printing House, who sent him to the hospital for care. It has been five years since then, and he is now studying in the second grade of elementary school. His father's name is Yan Shengdi, and he owns a flower shop in Shanghai, whose brand name is "Shijing", but the location is not clear. The hospital also kindly sent a recent photo of him.

Later, we learned from the Shanghai Flower and Tree Commercial Association that there was a "Shixin" flower shop at 154 Chongqing South Road, and the shop owner's surname was Ni and his name was Shengqi, which was similar to the target to be investigated. Then we went to visit him with full hope.

When the reporter was about to run to the intersection not far from Chongqing South Road, a medium-sized jeep sped past and brushed past him, which was a thrilling scene. There are regulations limiting the speed of vehicles in downtown areas, but unfortunate citizens are often sacrificed at the hands of such lawless drivers!

Walking into the Shixin flower shop, we found Ni Shengqi. After inquiring, it turned out to be Ni's son. Ni was so happy that he could not express his joy when he learned that his child, who had been missing for five years, was still alive. The reporter has been running around for several days and is very excited to have achieved this. Before leaving, Ni told the reporter that he would go to Suzhou to recognize him in a few days and would donate to the Wu County Baptist Orphanage as much as he could, and he was especially grateful to the anonymous reader who wrote the letter. More details will be continued.

### A Glimpse into Zhejiang Province's Fisheries

â He Xiaoquan

[Xiaoshan, 16th] At a time when calls to develop industries and save the economy from crisis are resonating loudly, Zhejiang's main products such as silk and tea have attracted the attention of people in society, but the fishing industry, which ranks first in the country, has yet to be discussed. As a reporter born in eastern Zhejiang, I would like to provide a report on the general situation of Zhejiang's fisheries based on my limited observations. Zhejiang Province borders the East China Sea. Although its area is smaller than other provinces, its coastline and

aquatic products

are the richest in the country. Its superior conditions include a mild climate, the passage of warm and cold currents, a central location, many freshwater rivers, original alluvial deposits rich in organic matter for breeding, and all the necessities for the reproduction of perennial organisms. Other factors such as the scattered coastal islands, cultural development, and convenient transportation are all essential for the development of fisheries. The winding ports, deep bays, and strategic terrain are also essential for establishing coastal defense and should not be ignored. In the Father of the Nation's hand-drafted industrial plan, the eastern major port, the third-class ports of Ningbo and Wenzhou, and the fishing ports of Changtu and Shipu, among the fifteen fishing ports, are all located in Zhejiang's waters. In order to consolidate national defense and develop the economy, we should gradually strive to complete them. Aquatic product enterprises can be divided into fishing, aquaculture, processing and manufacturing, and transportation departments, which are described below.

The key elements are fishing boats, fishing gear, fishing grounds, and talent and capital. Other factors such as fishing seasons and fishing methods should also be noted. Fishing boats are the main tool for fishing. Zhejiang fishermen, aware of their weak capital, make do with what they have and continue to use old-style canvas boats, which can only be used in coastal waters, are highly dangerous, and have a small catch. Before the war, new-style steam trawlers were used, but they were almost completely lost during the war. At a time when people's livelihoods are declining and fishermen cannot even get enough to eat, they are even less able to raise huge sums to purchase fishing boats. Therefore, it is hoped that the government will expand fishing loans and revitalize the fishing industry. Fishing gear can be divided into nets, hooks, and miscellaneous fishing gear, which differ depending on the boat used and the region. There are many types of nets, too numerous to list. The fish caught with nets are mostly large yellow croaker, small yellow croaker, , ribbonfish, squid, etc. There are also different types of hooks. The fish caught are ribbonfish, silverfish, , eel, bream, etc. The fishing grounds are in the area around Xishan, Zhoushan, Heishan, and Yuhuan Islands. Zhapu, Shenjiamen, Haimen, and Wenzhou are the four major fishing areas. Ningshen, Taizhou, and Wenzhou are the three major fishery administrative regions. The fishing season in Zhejiang's coastal areas is April and August for large yellow croaker, January to March and August to December for small yellow croaker, April and May for squid, March to June for shrimp, and August to December for ribbonfish, crabs, and eels. The fishing methods involve using various methods to concentrate fish so that a large amount of fish can be caught. At a time when science is flourishing and methods are constantly improving, stubborn fishermen still rely on old methods. In the future, it seems that we should abandon our shortcomings and learn from others to make up for our deficiencies.

Aquaculture

can be divided into deep-water and shallow-water types, as well as those in brackish water. This is still based on the habits of the organisms. In Zhejiang, the razor clams of Jia'ao and the blood clams of Fenghua are the most famous in saltwater. They are also farmed in Sanmen Bay, and their seedlings come from Qingjiangdu in Wenzhou. The next most important are Songmen. There is also aquaculture of laver and kelp along the coast, and there is currently a large output. In freshwater, there are the Qiantang River, Cao'e River, Ou River, and Feiyun River, etc. There are many rivers, lakes, and swamps that can be used to raise black carp, silver carp, ribbonfish, carp, etc. The raising of fish fry is very developed in Linghu, Huzhou, which is more than enough to supply the entire province. In addition to Linghu, Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Huzhou, and Yinxian are also quite famous for adult fish farming.

Processing

and manufacturing can be divided into two types: food and industrial products. For food product manufacturing, the salting and drying processes in Dinghai, Daishan, Shipu, Juexi, Haimen, and Wenzhou are relatively well-known. However, products such as canned goods and cod liver oil are still lacking. Transportation is the main condition for expanding business. Zhejiang has the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Zhejiang-Jiangxi railways. The Sujia and Hangzhou-Ningbo railways are being planned for restoration, and the Hangzhou-Wenzhou railway will soon begin construction. Highways are known to be developed, and waterways can smoothly connect major coastal commercial ports. There are many rivers within the territory, and transportation is convenient. However, refrigerated vehicles and ships are still being added. Zhejiang has all the conditions for developing fisheries, such as fishing, aquaculture, processing and manufacturing, transportation, and salt, and is better than other provinces. What is urgently needed now is nothing more than economy and talent. Although the Fisheries Administration Office has a large amount of fishery materials, it has been reported that it has allocated several canning factories and cod liver oil factories in the Zhoushan Islands, but the Zhejiang Branch of the Executive Yuan has already closed down. It is not known when this promise will take effect, which makes those who love and are dedicated to fisheries anxious.

Talent

The government is working hard to cultivate talent, such as the re-employment of demobilized military officers and the establishment of schools at all levels, which are all progressing separately. However, it will only be successful if fishermen are taught new methods and skills and cooperate with each other. If Zhejiang's fisheries can be fully developed, the economic problems can be easily solved, and the national economy and people's livelihood can be guaranteed. The wise government should not abandon this rich natural resource.

### Brief Notes from Guiyang

â Our reporter Liu Mengchi

[Our newspaper's airmail from Guiyang, 18th] With Guiyang as the center, the cost of living in provinces in all directions is higher than in Guiyang, no matter how important the city. Some time ago, all the officials, gentry, and merchants who could escape from all over the country, as long as they had a little relationship in Guiyang that they could use, flocked to this place where life was the cheapest. In less than two months, according to the report of the Municipal Government Statistics Office, the population of Guiyang unknowingly increased by twenty to thirty thousand people. Guiyang, which prospered because of the War of Resistance against Japan and declined because of the victory, is now lively again! The originally serious housing shortage is now becoming more serious. In the past, rents were quoted in legal tender and gold yuan, but the landlords immediately switched to real objects. Later, they felt that white rice could not rise to the price of gold and silver dollars, so they switched to gold bars and silver dollars. The local court and the police station are constantly handling rental disputes, which is unbearable. Recently, the most prosperous and lively business in Guiyang is the buying and selling of silver dollars. The clanging sound can be heard everywhere, and there are crowds of people. Civil servants and their families in the province and city are almost all involved in this business. Some are trying to preserve the value of their currency so that they can sell it easily when they need it, while others are purely because they can make a profit several times over. Standing in the silver dollar market for one or two hours a day yields more than half a year's income. No matter how the Provincial Capital Police Bureau disperses silver dollar vendors all day and all night, those who seek this silver profit can still be seen everywhere. Small people such as workers have no ability to do this, so they try their best to take turns to serve, using their time to fetch water, cook, do chores, sell newspapers in the afternoon, and work as retail vendors in the evening to make a living by selling rice and flour. Superiors sympathize with their subordinates, and officials sympathize with the workers. Public affairs are nothing more than a formality, and everyone is "tacitly aware" and no one asks anyone for "administrative efficiency."

### Relieving the Shortage of Paper Money: Silver and Money Businesses Suggest to the National Bank that It Issue Fixed-Amount Bank Drafts; Face Value Will Be Temporarily Divided into Four Types; the National Bank Agrees to Consider It

[Our newspaper's report] The silver, money, and trust industries in this city believe that the shortage of paper money has not been resolved in the past two weeks, and that the end of the month is approaching, so the need for cash will increase sharply. However, the National Bank still limits the withdrawal of cash to 10% to 12% of deposits from silver and money businesses every other day, so there is no way to fundamentally solve the shortage of paper money in the short term. Since all sectors feel that cash turnover is difficult, and silver and money businesses often have to deposit nine times the amount of cash in the National Bank due to the need for cash, which affects the scheduling of funds, they have informally discussed with the National Bank authorities, requesting that in addition to issuing cash as much as possible, if there is a shortage, they can only request the issuance of fixed-amount bank drafts from the Central Bank. The National Bank authorities had also long considered issuing fixed-amount bank drafts to make up for the shortage of cash. Now, in light of the suggestion from silver and money businesses, they have agreed to consider it. It is reported that the fixed-amount bank drafts are planned to be of four types: 5,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, and 100,000 yuan. If the authorities do not issue large-denomination banknotes with huge face values, and the Central Printing Plant's production capacity cannot meet the needs, then the issuance of fixed-amount bank drafts will definitely be realized in the short term.

It is also learned that after the silver, money, and trust industries suggested to the Central Bank that it issue fixed-amount bank drafts, they have already drafted a plan. Once the various public associations have made the final verification, they will submit it to the National Bank authorities for reference.

### National Bank Sells Limited Gold, and Gold Prices Reach Repeated Peaks

[Our newspaper's report] Gold's trend yesterday was very strong. The money market was unusually loose. Furthermore, because the Central Bank sold limited gold the day before, suspicions arose and rumors spread. Inside and outside the market, all parties were absorbing and pulling violently, and the market was boiling. The interbank interest rate fell, and the lending rate has already seen a continuous contraction. The gold price in Hong Kong was higher than the price in Shanghai, so people's minds were especially optimistic, and the market repeatedly moved toward a peak. The morning opened at 650 yuan. After the opening, all parties competed to absorb, and the market rose all the way, reaching a peak of 682 yuan. After the peak, the Central Bank did not sell, and the trading floor continued to pull up, and the market rose again to 684 yuan, and the intention to buy was still strong. After 11:40, the Central Bank began to sell, and people's minds immediately softened. The selling pressure on the trading floor gradually increased, and the market fell sharply, down to 678 yuan. Finally, the sale stopped, and people's minds became optimistic again, and the market rose again, firmly standing at 680 yuan at the noon close. Because the market was closed in the afternoon on Saturday, there was no trading in the market. The trend outside the market was even more optimistic than inside the market in the morning, and the trading floor was full of buying voices. The morning opened at 653 yuan, and the noon close was at 658 yuan. The delivery price for Monday afternoon opened at 755 yuan, 760 yuan. The evening close was at 753 yuan, 758 yuan.

US dollars opened at 13,000 yuan, 13,200 yuan in the morning. The noon close was 13,900 yuan, 14,000 yuan. The position for Monday afternoon opened at 15,100 yuan, 15,200 yuan, and closed at 15,100 yuan, 15,200 yuan.

The Hong Kong exchange rate opened at 1,000 yuan, 3 jiao, and 6 fen yesterday morning, and closed at the same price the night before. The gold yuan opened at 1,000 yuan, 4 jiao, and 8 fen yesterday morning, and closed at 4 jiao the night before. Hong Kong gold opened at 310 yuan per Hong Kong tael yesterday morning, and closed at 309 yuan and 86 fen the night before. The US dollar telegraphic transfer opened at 5 yuan and 24 fen yesterday morning, and closed at the same price the night before. The US dollar spot opened at 5 yuan and 23 fen yesterday morning, and closed at 5 yuan and 24 fen the night before. The US dollar forward opened at 5 yuan and 22 fen yesterday morning, and closed at the same price the night before.

### National Bank Branches Send Out Excessive Funds, Resulting in Loose Monetary Conditions

[Our newspaper's report] Yesterday, monetary conditions were extremely loose and excessive. The morning opened at around 50 yuan, and the various banks and businesses were generally holding long positions, and most of them were forcibly pressing prices to various parties between 50 and 60 yuan. However, the various industries were eagerly seeking to exit their long positions, and the daily interbank rate once fell to 30 to 40 yuan, which was the first time in half a month. In the afternoon, the money market turned slightly stable from loose and excessive due to the National Bank's sale of gold, and the daily interbank rate was finally between 40 and 50 yuan. Yesterday, the National Bank's treasury continued to send out more than 2.9 billion yuan. The various banks in the large clearing sent out more than 500 million yuan. The foreign merchants' banks sent out more than 100 million yuan. The various banks in the small clearing received more than 3.5 billion yuan.

### Price Index Deposits

Liu Gongyun Says He Is Considering It

Regarding the suggestion from the financial community in this city to the new Finance Minister Liu Gongyun to launch "gold deposits," "silver dollar deposits," and "price index deposits," Liu has already accepted and is considering launching them. According to Liu, who personally told reporters yesterday, this matter is still under discussion. There are currently no concrete measures or plans that can be announced. According to reporters who learned from responsible parties in the financial community, the authorities believe that among the suggestions from the financial community, "gold deposits" and "silver dollar deposits" face many technical difficulties and may be difficult to launch. However, "price index deposits" are very likely to be implemented. The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank are currently considering launching this matter, and it is expected that after implementation, it will definitely achieve considerable results in absorbing idle funds and stabilizing prices.

### Gold Market to Undergo Organizational Changes and Expansion of Business Scope

The new Finance Minister and President of the National Bank Liu Gongyun returned to Shanghai from Beijing on the 25th. On the morning of the 26th, at 10:00 a.m., he convened Xi Demao, Li Daonan, and others at the Bank of China to hold a gold and silver equalization meeting. In addition to reviewing the day's work, there were also important decisions on future business policies. It is reported that the organization of the gold market will undergo changes. The business scope will also be adjusted. The trust departments of banks and businesses can all act as brokers. The sale of silver dollars is also included. The trading method may adopt stock exchange methods. It is reported that the principles are no longer a problem. If it can be realized, the open market will become more sound. The Central Bank's use of the open market will also become more flexible. According to Liu, who told reporters, the supplementary measures to the financial reform plan are being studied. The urgent industrial loans to rescue the industrial and commercial crisis will be expanded in scope, and detailed measures are also being formulated. However, it has not yet been decided whether to adopt a ordering or acquisition method.

### Raw Silk Market Robust

The raw silk market rose sharply yesterday, and the interbank interest rate suddenly fell, and retail investors started buying domestic goods again. No. 120 had new silk goods. The morning opened at 2.73 million yuan for spot goods. It once rose to a high of 20 million yuan. The market has reached a peak, and bulls frequently sold off, and the market softened slightly. Near noon, the news of a sharp rise in gold prices boosted the market again. The noon close was still at 2.72 million yuan. The next-day position was made at 2.935 million yuan. The raw silk exchange rate continued to rise, and people's minds were optimistic. Superior grade opened at 3.95 million in the morning, and then rose all the way to 4.2 million at the noon close.

The silk and satin market was flat yesterday, and there were many retail sales. The market did not improve much. Huaqiang's cover cloth opened at 1.9 million in the morning, and then fell back 10,000 yuan. The trend was very flat. Recently, the news of a sharp rise in joint gold improved people's minds, but actual sales were still sluggish, and there was a lack of momentum to rise. The noon close was finally at 1.905 million yuan.

### Internal Exchange Rate Adjustment

### White Rice Breaks 70,000 Yuan; Flour and Cooking Oil Prices Rise Sharply

Yesterday's rice market was affected by the weekend and the addition of two days' interest, so the vendors pushed up prices aggressively. In addition, the holiday on Monday and good sales from all parties, as well as the lead of gold, made people's minds quite high. In particular, white rice broke the 70,000 yuan mark, and Wuxi white rice reached a peak of 71,500 yuan.

The price of cooking oil continued to rise sharply, and the shortage of goods was serious. In addition, the money market was loose, so the vendors pushed up prices even more aggressively. All grades of goods rose by 20%. Factory soybean oil broke the 400,000 yuan mark, vegetable oil reached 360,000 yuan, and Jiton vegetable oil was out of stock. Small cart sesame oil was 486,000 yuan, and soybean cake rose 4,000 yuan, with Changzi at 27,000 yuan.

The price of flour gradually rose sharply. With the easing of monetary conditions, both actual sales and retail sales were brisk. In addition, with the holiday on Monday, vendors calculated at three days' interest, so they pushed up prices aggressively. Old Che flour rose by 10%, with Bingship flour at 26,150 yuan.

The price of miscellaneous grains rose sharply. The price of soybeans rose sharply due to the crazy rise in Tongri oil cake. People's minds were firm, and the money market was loose, so the market had strong buying interest. Che beans rose sharply by 20%, and the future market shouted a price of 73,600 yuan. The supply of Shengshi beans was extremely scarce, and prices generally rose by 15%. Sesame and corn had very good actual sales, and prices generally rose by about 20%. Mung beans rose by 10,000 yuan, and red beans broke the 30,000 yuan mark.

Tea Market Lively and Robust

[Our newspaper's report] According to people in the tea industry, tea stocks are almost exhausted. At the same time, it is learned that tea-producing areas in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province, are already brewing plans to value this year's new tea, which has not yet been put on the market, in terms of white rice. Roughly, each dan of new tea requires more than eight shi of white rice. Therefore, the minds of the vendors have become even more excited, and the intention to sell the small amount of old tea in their hands has resurfaced, resulting in a strange shortage of supply, a decline in transactions, but the market atmosphere is still comparable to the foreign exchange remittance certificates, and it is exceptionally lively and robust. As for this year's new Longjing tea in Wenzhou, it is said to be continuously produced in the source area. The price among traders is still 8,000 yuan per jin, which is not much different from before.

Tung Oil Rises Again After the trend of tung oil turned flat some days ago, the market's rising trend was reignited yesterday, and there was a momentum of being out of control. The reason for this is that the money market in the industry has become increasingly flooded, and the price of materials outside the industry has reached its peak, resulting in crazy price increases, and the shouting price is like a runaway horse. As a result, the range of increase was wider than before, ranging from 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and the foundation was quite solid.

Recently, according to people in the industry, the China Trust Bureau is again purchasing sufficient tung oil to pay for exports abroad, and it is reported that the purchase price is 1 jiao and 7 fen and 6 li US dollars.

### Spring Overcoat Fabric Expensive and Scarce

The circulation of spring overcoat fabrics in the market has been quite small recently, and it is very difficult for buyers to search for new colors. In addition to Hum Four, Harris, Herringbone, and Real and Fake Master Po Trix, there is a severe lack of suitable woolen fabrics. Even the above-mentioned brands lack those of good quality and fresh colors. Imported goods have not arrived for a long time, and local factories are seeking a way out for thin woolen papers, and are not paying attention to wool overcoat fabrics. Those that are occasionally produced are also ordinary, low-end goods below 10,000 to 20,000 yuan per yard, resulting in a situation where the sellers hoard old goods and blindly shout high prices.

### Taiwanese Traders Handling Cloth

Taiwanese traders have been handling woolen cloths quite a lot in the past few days. The woolen cloths are limited to light-colored and thin qualities for men and women, and there is no business for high-end, thick qualities. The cloths are mostly gunny cloth, white canvas, Aihua flannel, Four Various threads, and Yousheng flannel, etc. Yesterday, the transaction price of Yousheng flannel was 8,000 yuan per yard, Four Various threads 3,500 yuan, and canvas 7,000 yuan, Huayi hemp adhesive 4,500 yuan, Zhang Flower flannel 65,000 yuan, Shuang Mao Bizhi 54,000 yuan, Yihua Grey Huarang 70,000 yuan, and Fen Long Fan Lixi 35,000 yuan.

### Price Increase Outside the Circle; Shanghai Shares Firm at the Close

[Our newspaper's report] The Shanghai stock market was weak but firm yesterday, and all stocks closed at high prices. Initially, it was heard that monetary conditions were still loose and excessive, and the gold market outside the circle was rising sharply, and the bulls were strong. However, because of concerns about the threat of the Central Bank's gold sales, and because of the double negative interest rates for leaving the market on Tuesday, the buying interest was brewing and not released, and the market mostly took a wait-and-see approach, and the market hovered at a flat level. Later, it was heard that the idle funds outside the circle had strong potential, and the gold market rebounded after being suppressed, so the various parties took advantage of the low prices to enter the market, and the buying pressure on the floor suddenly increased. Yongsha opened at 7.35 yuan in the morning. After the opening, the overnight bulls turned short, and the market softened, reaching a low of 7.06 yuan. After the low, the prices of goods outside the circle rose across the board, and the market improved. The bulls and bears struggled, and the market fluctuated at around 7 yuan, 3 jiao. Later, the news of gold sales was transmitted, and the market softened once, falling back to 7 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen. Near noon, it was heard that the amount of gold sales was not large, and the gold price rebounded sharply, and the market became lively. The buying pressure rose from all sides, and the market rose sharply, finally closing at a high price of 7.95 yuan at noon.

Small and medium-sized stocks were absorbed by retail investors in the morning, and the market was still flat. It was once weak in the middle, but all rose at the close. Xinguang opened at 6 jiao and 7 fen, and then fell to 6 jiao and 5 fen, before rising to the limit of 8 jiao at the close. Jingfu Qinxing Meiya opened and closed higher, and the innerwear was 2 jiao and 4 fen, rising to 2 jiao and 9 fen, and the remaining stocks were all strong at the close.

Resumption of After-Hours Market on Monday

The Securities Exchange has decided to resume after-hours trading from Monday (the 28th). It has been learned that regarding the date of resumption of the after-hours market, if customers request it, brokers can apply to the exchange for settlement procedures for next-day delivery transactions that are discussed and completed in the afternoon. Yongsha, Meiya, Jingfu, and Xinguang will be used as pilot projects. The above measures will only be implemented for those applied for by customers.

Foreign Shares and Gold Bonds Rise

The foreign stock market was showing a firm trend, the money market was easing, and the buying interest was very strong. The gold price rose, and people's minds were especially optimistic. The various stocks rose sharply at noon. Yisha was made at 19,000 yuan, 19,500 yuan, and 19,500 yuan, an increase of 3,500 yuan. English Union 23,000 yuan, 25,000 yuan, up 2,000 yuan. Yeguang 7,000 yuan, also up 1,000 yuan. Wheelock had a stronger increase than other stocks, making 72,000 yuan, a huge increase of 7,000 yuan. The remaining stocks were all lively. The gold bonds opened at 380,000 bid, 390,000 ask in the morning, and rose to 415,000 yuan in the middle, closing at 430,000 yuan. The market was closed on Saturday after that.

### Yarn Prices Hit New Highs, Cotton Cloth Fluctuations Narrow

The yarn market rebounded sharply, mainly because it had been weak for several days, and many people were taking advantage of the low prices to buy in. In addition, the money market was flooded with capital, and the market discount rate even fell to around 40 yuan. As a result, people's hearts were restless, and buyers scrambled to purchase yarn. Holders were unwilling to sell, leading to a supply shortage and soaring market prices. The prices of various yarns reached unprecedented new highs.

42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose from 4.37 million yuan to close at 4.53 million yuan, a jump of 410,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix yarn also rose by 420,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon yarn opened at 2.9 million yuan in the morning and then surged past the 3 million mark, settling at 3.12 million yuan, a gain of 370,000 yuan.

20-count Double Horse spot yarn started at 2.23 million yuan. News of the surge in "red gold" then spread, and holders uniformly raised their asking prices. The price then rose all the way to 2.425 million yuan, a gain of 370,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 340,000 yuan. Other brands, such as Golden Rooster and Heavenly Maiden, were traded at around 2.2 million yuan, and 16-count yarns of all grades broke through the 2 million mark.

Yesterday, the trend of cotton cloth remained largely unchanged, with very narrow price fluctuations. Although there were reports of rising prices for "red boiled" cloth and a flooded money market, people's spirits were not lifted, and the market remained dull and lifeless. Speculators had no intention of either buying or selling. Trading on this street was quiet, and few customers inquired about prices. The final prices of various cloths rose slightly, but were barely enough to offset the discount rate.

Dragon Head fine cloth rose from 85,500 yuan all the way to 88,000 yuan at closing, a gain of 4,000 yuan compared to the previous day. There were no transactions for Trumpet Boy fine cloth. Five Blessings fine cloth also rose by 2,000 yuan. In addition, Large Double Dragon and Three Peaches fine cloth each rose by around 4,000 yuan.

Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge opened at 82,800 yuan and briefly rose to 83,100 yuan. The midday closing price was 83,000 yuan, a gain of 2,600 yuan. Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance Yuan Serge was priced at 81,000 yuan, a gain of 2,000 yuan. Yesterday, because most holders felt the market price was too low, they were unwilling to sell cheaply, so trading was very sluggish, and no one was willing to open positions in unpopular grades.

### Market Stroll

â By a Spectator

The Stock Exchange Works Hard to Boost Morale and Promotes Trading Through Rewards and Penalties

Yesterday, the Stock Exchange issued five market announcements in a row, numbered 659 to 663. Two of these announcements encouraged brokers to increase their trading volume as much as possible. Otherwise, they would be fined, and even have their trading suspended. If they did a lot of business, they would be given bonuses.

Last week, trading on the Stock Exchange was extremely sluggish, which caused stock prices to plummet.

Yesterday, the market suddenly improved. Although we mentioned on Thursday that a surge might occur in the next few days, these two announcements about penalties and rewards were clearly very effective.

Yesterday, not only did the stock market improve, but the general market was also aiming for a high point.

The market always has the younger generation pushing the older generation forward. "Aiming for" is just an empty phrase that can never be taken as real.

In the past ten days or so, rice and coal have stood out, while others have paled in comparison. Therefore, we believe that they will aim for higher prices.

Yesterday, general market prices were catching up rapidly. The younger generation pushed the older generation forward, and the rise in rice and coal prices was even stronger.

The rise in rice and coal prices was by no means accidental. We have long pointed out that, considering the authorities' various measures to ensure price increases, and considering the overall environment, prices had to rise.

Gold, banknotes, silver dollars, and rice and coal are the same. Within the overall environment, rising prices are a natural trend, which we have repeatedly pointed out.

A general price increase has already begun. However, spectators must not be infatuated.

We pointed out on Wednesday the "regular trend," which is "Knock out goods a week in advance, release discount interest rates to prepare for positions, this is the urgency of the near term."

To knock out goods and reverse positions, there must first be a price surge. Therefore, yesterday's price surge must be fully utilized, but one must also be careful every step of the way.

We have also repeatedly pointed out that, paying attention to the overall environment, one must be careful because heavy and light items have very different fates. Although "aiming for" is a necessity under the principle of balanced commodity prices, it is meaningless if it only evens out on paper and lacks real implementation.

Because yesterday's price surge may be larger than most people expect, it is necessary to remember these basic conditions. Getting dizzy is highly inappropriate.

Isn't there a date, a location, and people involved in the peace talks?

Everyone hopes for peace, and hopes for it fervently. Therefore, good prospects for prices dilute the environment of tight winds and heavy rain.

Yesterday's price surge is undeniably related to this. But, ah, there are many facts to consider carefully. That was the case in the past, and it is still the case now. Therefore, the realization of the peace talks can be likened to catching sand crabs, requiring everyone to lay their cards on the table.

Laying the cards on the table determines the win or loss, which also determines peace or war; the rebound in the market is self-evident.

Lay cards, catch sand crabs, a price surge, you must be careful.

### Basketball League Situation Settled: China United Defeats Shiyu to Secure Top Spot

[Our Newspaper] In last night's basketball league match between China United and Shiyu, China United won 46-34. The half-time score was 18-16. Although China United still has two games left, they are inconsequential.

There was a large crowd of fans at the stadium last night, and ticket sales totaled 2.201 million yuan. There were 300 reserved seats, 1,500 downstairs seats, and 500 upstairs seats. The scene was unprecedented, and it is estimated that there were more than 3,000 people who did not purchase tickets.

In the first half, the two sides were evenly matched and tied repeatedly. China United was quite troubled. In the second half, Wu Chengzhang's success, Liu Fushen's two corner shots, and Li Zhenzhong's "opportunistic steals" demoralized Shiyu. When the score was 28-23, China United was able to breathe a sigh of relief. Shiyu's overly busy substitutions gave the opponent the advantage of waiting for changes.

In the women's group, Xinghua defeated John by three points, 34-31. In another Group A1 match, McKinsey defeated Haiqing by a large margin, 41-20. Haiqing's appearance of Cherden Ham Springã did not show any improvement.

Group A Championship Decided

First, let's talk about the match between China United and Shiyu. China United started with Li Zhenzhong, Bao Songyuan, Le Jiazhou, Liu Fushen, and Wu Chengzhang. Shiyu responded with Sun Guozheng, Xu Zhongyi, Wu Xinyun, Li Zhaohe, and Shen Pengju. This match was originally scheduled for 7:15 p.m., but it actually started at 7:45 p.m.

The match began amidst cheers. Guozheng missed a free throw, and Xinyun scored the first point. China United's Chengzhang and Jiazhou scored four points with one shot and two free throws. Pengju then made two free throws to tie the score at four. Lao Bao stabilized the situation with another basket, 6-4, and Shiyu called their first timeout. Xinyun and Zhongyi complemented each other, making two long-range shots. Pengju also scored under the basket, 10-6, taking the lead. China United substituted Jin Sheng for Xiao Le. Jin Sheng, Zhenzhong, and Songyuan then tied the score at ten. Shiyu also temporarily rested. Then, Fushen shot, and Shiyu's Cai Jindian and Wu Xinyun made three consecutive free throws, taking the lead again at 13-12. China United's shots failed to find the basket four or five times. Lao Bao got the ball and dribbled it in, and Chengzhang lived up to expectations, 14-13, putting China United ahead by one point. Xinyun was substituted for Zhaohe. Soon after, Zhaohe entered, and Guozheng exited. Zhenzhong took advantage of a moment of leisure, Zhongyi scored, and Songyuan came again. When Xinyun scored with a free throw, the first half ended, 18-16, with China United only leading by two points.

In the second half, Shiyu's Guozheng and Jindian, Xinyun and Zhongyi both made long-range shots with great skill. Chengzhang tied the score at 20. Lao Bao committed a foul, and Pengju failed to make the free throw. Chengzhang then tied the score again (22), and the game entered a physical struggle. At 25-23, Huaiting substituted Zhaohe. Although China United scored another basket, they still dared not be careless. Before long, Jindian replaced Xinyun. Wu Fu scored three points, putting China United ahead 28-23, which seemed to give them some confidence. Zhenzhong and Fushen "followed the current," making the score 33-25. Xiao Le replaced Jin Sheng. Shiyu then made the same mistake again, substituting too frequently. Yao Wenyi went in and out again. In the last three minutes, the score became 44-30. Zhang Liangxiong replaced Zhenzhong. The situation was set, but Shiyu's efforts did not stop. The audience still shouted, but China United finally won 46-34.

Xinghua Women's Team Defeats John

In the opening match of the women's group, Xinghua's Wang Shan and Qian Mengyue made free throws one after another. John's Zhang Luoluo and Lin Jingyi resisted stubbornly, and the score was tied at four in an instant. Wang Shan's height gave her considerable freedom in shooting. In the first quarter, Xinghua had 12 points and John had 6 points. In the second quarter, Luoluo worked hard, and the score was only one basket away at 16-14, which startled Xinghua. The half-time score was 18-14, with Xinghua leading by four points. In the third quarter, John's Jingyi and Handa played strongly, and the score was always close. Miss Lin made a free throw, and the score was tied at 23. In this quarter, Xinghua made major substitutions, with Zhu Jiazhen replacing Cheng Zhaorui and Wang Wenjian replacing Zhu Lanzhen as defender, and Zhang Xiuli replacing Ze Lun. The third quarter ended with each team scoring 23 points. In the final quarter, everyone showed their colors, and each team scored a basket, refusing to give way. The audience did not favor one team over the other, and cheered whenever a basket was made. Qian Mengyue scored four consecutive baskets, which greatly supported Xinghua's efforts. As a result, Xinghua won 34-31.

Cherden Initially Shows Potential

Haiqing, led by Cherden Ham, appeared last night. Their tall black player, also called Brown, had the stance of the Black Whirlwind from "Water Margin," always marking McKinsey and Owen Gai closely. McKinsey, familiar with the court, forced Haiqing to call a timeout within ten minutes with a score of 10-2. Haiqing's offense was not without ferocity, but the accuracy was too poor. After ten minutes, the score was 22-5. McKinsey then substituted fresh troops. The half-time score was 29-5. Haiqing was not discouraged.

In the second half, Haiqing's situation improved. Li Pula became more skilled, and after the score reached 32-16, McKinsey brought on four good players, resulting in a final score of 41-20.

### China Aviation and Railway Clash: New Champion to Be Revealed Today

[Our Newspaper] Due to continuous rain over the past two weeks, the Mayor's Cup final has been postponed twice. It has been rescheduled for 3:00 p.m. today at the Yiyuan Stadium. To avoid crowding, tickets will be sold in advance at the Yiyuan entrance in the morning and at the Municipal Stadium from 12:30 p.m. There are two types of tickets, priced at 1,200 yuan and 800 yuan. At that time, the Mayor's representative, Director Zhang Peter of the Municipal Government's Confidential Office, will attend to present the awards. The Municipal Government Band will play music at the venue, and the Fourth Dimension Boy Scouts will maintain order. However, due to the recent rain, whether the match can be held can be confirmed by calling the Football Committee at 38683 and Yiyuan at 74580 or 78571.

Today's referee is Le, and the linesmen are Ni Xiaoben and Lu Shunde.

The new Cup champion will receive fifteen silver medals, and the runner-up will receive fifteen bronze medals. This year, because the defending champion, Qingbai Association, was eliminated, and the Donghua Association did not register to participate, the new champion and runner-up will likely be new teams.

China Aviation and Railway have been training hard during the two-week break, rain or shine. The athletes have been sharpening their skills, and the authorities have been encouraging their morale, waiting for the opportunity. Today, when they meet, both sides will use all their strength, competing in both intelligence and ability. A fierce battle is inevitable.

Due to the rain the day before yesterday, the field is still muddy. Railway's short passing tactics are best suited for a wet field after rain. Although they have the advantage of location and more experience, whether they can repeat their triumph over China Aviation in the league match depends on the state of the players. It should be noted that in such an important final, the players must have enough energy to compete for the full 90 minutes. Luck becomes an important factor in determining victory. If Railway wants to secure victory, they must increase the speed of their wingers so that they can fly together. Then the three forwards in the center can achieve breakthroughs. With Gao Baozheng stationed in the defense, unless China Aviation has a strategy to avoid strength and attack weakness, it will be difficult to break through Lao Gao's formidable barrier.

The two-week break has been beneficial to China Aviation in terms of time and space. If they can borrow a player from Hong Kong, they will have a strong hope of winning the championship. Even if they do not borrow a player and only recall Zhuang Wenquan and other old players, it will still be a threat to Railway. Strategically speaking, Xu Zuguo should be used as a winger to increase the speed on both wings. To break through Gao Baozheng's iron formation, they should adopt a four-forward attack, with one forward serving as a striker. Gao Xiuqing should be in charge of the striker's duties, because Xiao Gao is skilled in controlling, passing, dribbling, and shooting, and has delicate footwork. He is a figure who the Railway defenders must pay attention to. If he can move freely in the midfield and gain control, then Railway's defense will be uneasy. Defense must be strong, and Railway's forwards must be kept outside the 15-yard line, so that Xu Fusheng can be as stable as Mount Tai. China Aviation's defense is the biggest weakness, and whether they can defeat Railway depends on whether their defense has a way to stop Railway. The lineups are as follows: (Qi Gong)

Railway

Liao Xiong

Yue Shixiao Wu Jiabang

Lu Bingsheng Gao Baozheng Cao Liming

Wu Binghao Re Ziwen Zhang Jie Lu Qingxiang Lin Dianyi

China Aviation

Xu Fusheng

Xie Xichuan Zhuang Wenquan Fang Shancui

### Women's Basketball Main Team to Play Green Team Tonight: Meet Li Team

The Fourth Basketball League will have three women's Group A matches as usual this weekend, starting at 5:30 p.m. at the Municipal Stadium. In the first match, the women's main team will play the Green Team again, facing the Li Team. This match is crucial for the championship prospects and should be exciting. In the final Group A1 second-round match, Huili will play Pei Fei Er. Both teams have been in excellent form recently and are at their peak. A fierce battle is inevitable when they meet. Tickets are priced as before, 500 yuan upstairs, 1,000 yuan downstairs, and 1,500 yuan for reserved seats inside the venue. The schedule is as follows:

Green Team - Li Team (Women's Group) 5:30 p.m.

Donghua - Youyi (Group A2) 6:15 p.m.

Huili - Pei Fei Er (Group A1) 7:15 p.m.

In the women's main team match, the Green Team and the Li Team will meet again. The Green Team has won all six of its matches and remains undefeated, while the Li Team has also won five matches, but suffered its only defeat in the first round against the Green Team. Tonight's rematch is a narrow path for rivals, and winning will give them hope of winning the championship. Unfortunately, the team members are all short in stature. Although their skills are flexible, they still suffer a disadvantage. The Green Team's female generals are fierce as tigers, and their forwards and defenders are strong and abnormal. With such heavy responsibilities, the Li Team may be stretched thin.

In the second act, Donghua and Youyi will compete in Group A2. The former is always victorious, and the latter is always defeated. The game will be one-sided, without question.

In the final match, Huili will face Pei Fei Er in the second round of Group A1. Pei Fei Er suffered seven losses in seven games in the first round, without a single win. In the second round, they have changed completely. Except for a small setback against the Shanghai Police, they have defeated China United, McKinsey, Haiqing, and Encas in a revenge spree. Black Brown is the most dangerous, followed by Kleger Leichi and Ikate, who are all extremely brave. Huili has made great progress recently. Their victory over the Shanghai Police was not easy, and their recent defeat of Ren Yu was outstanding. Fu Hai, Zhiji, and Yongfang have accurate shooting, and their attacks are also fast. Hua Wei and Xiao Wei's collaboration is also more tacit. Tonight, these two teams with strong momentum and full of energy will give a tense performance that is worth watching. The single-player lists of the six teams are as follows:

(Green Team) Huang Mingyuan, Shi Zonglan, Cao Manli, Zhu Jinjun, Wang Weizhen, Wu Ailian, Cao Manzhu, Wu Meiyi, Lu Weijun.

(Li Team) Qian Chuping, Qian Hanzhan, Zhu Cuidi, Niu Yunjuan, Yao Silian, Xu Huiyu, Chen Wenying, Cai Mingxia, Chen Yuling, Guo Maidianpei, Xu Muben, Jin Lili.

(Donghua) Han Longhai, Li Yao, Zhou Da, Chen Xianglong, Jia Youliang, Zhang Linggen, Zhang Banglun, Zhang Yuanji, Cai Yanxiong.

(Youyi) Su Shifeng, Luo Zhongzhou, Han Fei, Shi Hui, Jin Yan, Ling Zhihao, Zhang Fa, Wei Yuping, He Luo, Wang Xuewu.

(Huili) Zhang Pu, Tian Fuhai, Cao Zhiji, Wang Yongfang, Wei Xu, Chen Zhengyu, Hua Yunshan, Xu Shuyuan.

(Pei Fei Er) Klemontoye, Brown, Mu Hui, Greici, Tie Bosi, Si Tu He, Ikate, Pai Ke Si, Hua Jin Si.

### Hong Kong Hualian Football Team to Saigon: Contribution of 180,000 Coins

[Hong Kong Aviation News] Regarding Hualian's trip to Saigon, although the Saigon side has formally sent a letter expressing their welcome, the Hong Kong Football Association places importance on the Hong Kong League and is deeply concerned that allowing Hualian to leave Hong Kong for two weekends, as proposed by Saigon, would have too much impact on the competition. Therefore, at the association's executive committee meeting this month, it was decided to allow Hualian to leave Hong Kong for only one weekend and stated that Hualian players must be able to participate in the Hong Kong League on April 23rd before the trip to Saigon would be approved. In response, the Chinese Football Association sent a letter to Saigon requesting a change of date. Saigon has now replied, agreeing to change the two matches to April 17th and 18th, for a total of two matches. They have also revised the guarantee of income for the Hualian team to 180,000 coins. The Chinese Football Association has scheduled an executive committee meeting at 5:45 p.m. on Tuesday, the 29th of this month, at the Holland Room to discuss the matter. If the trip is approved, representatives may also be selected at the same time.

### Ping Pong Knowledge (1)

â Written by Wang Xinjing, Edited by Chen Linsheng

Mr. Wang Xinjing was the editor of the pre-war "Ping Pong World" monthly magazine. The "Ping Pong Knowledge" book he edited is rich in material and lively in writing. It is a rare masterpiece among table tennis books. However, the book was completely destroyed in the war not long after it was published. Now Mr. Wang is quite disheartened and unable to consider reprinting it. He has specially granted my humble request to select the best parts and publish them in this newspaper successively. This is truly a blessing for readers who love table tennis. Please pay attention to it. Chen Linsheng

(1) She Always Smiles Lightly at Us

Introduction

The handsome and sparkling ping pong ball, she always smiles lightly at us.

The currently popular soccer, basketball, volleyball, tennis, high jump, javelin... are all good activities that are beneficial to the body. But we should not deny that some sports are subject to age or gender restrictions. Therefore, we often see some people who understand the importance of exercise in life and love sports. When they reach old age, even if they hold the things they love in their hands, they cannot help but feel "more flesh on the thighs." It is absolutely impossible for you to gallop on the battlefield and enjoy the fun again. It is not an empty suspicion. Old generals on the battlefield can only sit in the stands and reminisce, and can no longer experience it personally. Even if young girls have a love for some sports, they can only stand quietly on the sidelines, screaming "good" in a soft voice.

Our ping pong ball, which we love to play, has a beautiful appearance, and she smiles and welcomes everyone to play. If you are used to sweating a few drops, she can give you genuine satisfaction. Men can use a ping pong ball to recover from work fatigue; women can use a ping pong ball to increase family interest; old women can have a ping pong ball so that they will not be annoyed by hearing what their beloved children say.

(2) I Can Play With Her Anywhere

The fact that ping pong is not limited by age and gender has already been mentioned above. At the same time, ping pong is also a kind of sport that requires relatively simple equipment and saves a lot of money. You only need a table, a net, and your own ping pong paddle and ping pong ball. If our economy is relatively affluent and we have the power to build a standard ping pong table, that is naturally the best. If we can't, we can also use two dining tables or piece together a few boards and play comfortably and happily. If the house is large, you can play at home. Otherwise, when there is no wind, you can build her stage anywhere. With simple equipment, she can accompany us to play almost anywhere.

(3) Only She Can Accompany Us at Any Time

Because she is lively and constantly striving for self-improvement; because she loves natural beauty and does not like to decorate unnecessarily; because she sincerely wants to be close to us, so everything about her is simple and convenient. If you like her, you can put her in your pocket; if you like her, you can ask her to dance. If you feel bored or tired, she can do her best to eliminate it for you; if you are worried or distressed, she can comfort youâ¦ In short, everything about her is lovely. And only she can accompany us to dance at any timeâday or night.

However, friends who love her must sometimes pay attention to everything besides her, so as not to let her suffer. Teachers are seriously teaching in the classroom, and children should not put her in their minds at this time, and take her out to look at her from time to time. My mind cannot have two thoughts at the same time. When doing things, I can only temporarily place her properly in a placeâ¦ Unfortunately, she is discovered by the teacher in the classroom; unfortunatelyâ¦ it is not good to blame her for her loving nature and unwillingness to distinguish. In short, she is good, I am good, and everyone is good, which is the most important thing.

### US Military Forms Combined Team to Challenge China League

The replacement for the 9th Regiment is the 3rd Regiment, and the replacement for the Pfeiffer is Charlton. The US military teams have made rapid progress. The Chinese League is planning a farewell commemorative match, in which the US military will combine to challenge the China League. This match will be held early next week. This match is currently being negotiated by the Basketball Committee. If it becomes a reality, it will be the most exciting basketball game of the season.

### Think a Step Back

â Wu Deyun

Those who are dissatisfied with the status quo will immediately feel at peace as long as they are willing to think a step back.

For example, those small clerks who complain about their meager salaries only need to convert their mere tens of thousands of yuan in monthly salary into legal tender; one becomes three million, so isn't that hundreds of billions? Think a step back; before the war, even the great China probably didn't have so much paper money â is that still not enough?

Another example is the poor wretches who have one meal a day or none, and they feel indignant when they see others eating big fish and meat. But they have never thought that in ancient times, our ancestors could only "eat raw meat and drink blood," and they had never even eaten cooked food. It was really pitiful. Speaking a step back: Although coal briquettes are expensive now, we still don't have to eat raw food; although we have to squeeze for household rice, we still don't have to risk our lives and go to the forest to hunt for food.

Another example is those who are very heartbroken about corrupt officials and bureaucrats are actually very silly. Generally speaking, all within the four seas are brothers. Since we are originally one family, then what does it matter if our own people take a little money? What's more, thinking a step back: money is "an external thing," you can't bring it with you when you are born, and you can't take it with you when you dieâold brother, you can be greedy if you want to, I'm happy to be generous.

Another example is those who feel very panicked about the recent Cold War between the two major international blocs, fearing that a third world war is bound to break out. I can only blame those people for being too narrow-minded. Because they cannot think a step back: the earth may be suddenly attacked by a flying meteor, and that kind of destruction is more terrible than a world war. So,âthinking even a step backâfor example, what if the meteor has already collided with the earth? But we can actually survive to this day, isn't it already very worthy of "congratulating with hands on forehead"?

When thinking about everything like this, we will be very calmâalthough we will inevitably be scolded.

### Talking About Humor and Other Things

â Chen Yaoguang

The theory of humor comes from the West. The original meaning is an expression of mood, especially a witty mood. Today, some people also interpret a sense of humor as a gentler temper. Sometimes in a situation where several people are telling jokes, after one of them gets angry, someone will often say: "We are just joking, how can you not even have this little sense of humor?" It can be seen that the use of humor is also great.

Humor can also be explained as a more subtle kind of slapstick, that is to say, it is a kind of slapstick that is less easily and widely understood. Slapstick is when you laugh out loud as soon as you hear it or even before you finish listening, and humor is when you laugh out loud two or three seconds after you finish listening, or even after someone points it out (except for those with particularly agile minds). Before the term humor was introduced into China, it wasn't that we didn't have humor. To put it bluntly, what the ancients called wit and humor was humor. Today's so-called sense of humor means not taking small things that are not pleasing to the ear or not pleasing to the eye too seriously. It is true that you can ask someone to bring out a sense of humor when telling jokes, but if you scold someone's ancestors and still blame them for saying, "How can you not have any sense of humor?" then that is ridiculous.

Dr. Lin Yutang, who is known as the master of humor, lived in the United States for many years. In addition to desperately instilling imported humor culture in China, he also sent small-footed culture abroad from time to time, in exchange for a large amount of US dollar royalties. Although Dr. Lin has been promoting humor for many years, when one of his daughters eloped with a foreigner, he was so angry that he kept panting. Where did Dr. Lin's sense of humor go? It can be seen that advocating is easy, but putting it into practice is difficult. Talking about humor is easy to say, but achieving the point of having a sense of humor is not something that can be done overnight, and even gentlemen who are full of Western culture are no exception. As noble as President Truman, if he had a good sense of humor, he would not have scolded columnist Pearson as an S.O.B. People cannot completely lose their true selves. The difficulty of humor has been proven again.

Modern people like to follow trends, yearning for humor and doing their best to create imitations, but in the end they are just imitations, and they are not from their nature, so most of them are not well-done. The development of a sense of humor depends half on talent and half on training. Moreover, humor must also be used in the right place. Otherwise, if you suffer a big loss from others and still smile indifferently thinking that you have a sense of humor, then it is simply unbearable.

### East Scale and West Claw

â Cang Yi

Tolstoy's handwriting was very scrawled and often changed. No one but his wife could understand his original manuscript. His wife had rewritten his "War and Peace" manuscript seven times. Whether the wooden pillars supporting the power lines, buried underground, are decayed and need to be replaced can now be determined after first using X-rays to inspect them at night.

### Price Reduction

â Dian Chen

In this day and age, the term "price reduction" seems very unfamiliar. Apart from being used by merchants as a business gimmick, it can be said that it has been rarely heard of for a long time.

It is rare for the two road bureaus to favor it, and this cannot but make people feel excited.

But I also feel that this "reduction" seems not to be a natural one.

Despite saying it so beautifully: "Reducing the burden on passengers," in fact, it is just to reduce the burden on first-class passengers.

As for third-class passengers? There is no mention of it later.

### Strange Tales of Plants

â Cang Yi

The soil in Australia is mostly composed of calcium sulphate. Cereals grow on it, and if some calcium sulphate is not applied, they will never bear grain. But they need very little copper sulphate, only a few grams per hundred acres of cereals. Bananas are not like peaches, plums, plums, and apricots, which have a hard kernel. But in eastern Java, there is a kind of stone banana, which is no more than four and a half inches long, and contains one hundred and ten to dozens of kernels the size of mung beans.

The oldest tree in the world is a silk fir tree in Hagga, Mexico, with a circumference of one hundred and seventy-five feet and an age of about ten thousand years. It is still growing very luxuriantly. Its wood weighs one million two hundred and eight thousand pounds, enough to build more than twenty foreign houses.

A strange cucurbitaceous plant growing on the coast of the Mediterranean and northern Africa is called the "spray melon." When its fruit matures, it automatically separates from the pedicel and shoots the fruit a long distance away.

### The Wonderful Use of the Eight-legged Essay

â Suo Bei

The eight-legged essay also has its wonderful uses.

Reason: The eight-legged essay is a set of ready-made and fixed formulas. With it, complex and complicated problems can be turned into simple and easy to understand. As long as you are familiar with and use that set of formulas, it is not difficult to get the answer. And the answer produced by the formula must be only one, and there is no distinction.

When I was a child, I often discovered the wonderful use of the eight-legged essay when writing essays in Chinese class: no matter what topic the teacher gave, I always said a few words from the "positive" aspect, then a few words from the "negative" aspect, and then "combined" them to get a conclusion. It was not difficult to make, and it always worked.

Living today, reading books and newspapers, dealing with people, and even writing essays and speaking are not easy, but if you understand the wonderful use of the eight-legged essay, everything will not be a problem.

First, let's talk about reading books and newspapers:

Today's books, newspapers, and periodicals are so numerous in variety and quantity, so different in statements, so different in tones, and so different in the terms and jargon used to explain ancient and modern theories, that they are all dizzying. Moreover, the economic burden cannot be sustained, the mental strength cannot cope, and the time cannot be allocated. Especially in today's "prices are keeping up with interest rates," our small citizens and public teachers have to find ways to maintain a little bit of their currency value even if they don't do business. Every day, they inevitably have to run to Henan Road to ask about the "big head" market. Where can they have enough time and energy to carefully chew on the various annotations of "democracy" and "freedom," or to check the origins of "Cold War" and "Hot War"? This one is right, that one is wrong, one alliance in the East, one alliance in the Westâ¦ These are not things that we can explore calmly with one brain, one pair of eyes, and one pair of ears. In desperation, we have to find a set of eight-legged essays, a formula, in the complicated and chaotic world, and be determined to read one type of book, read one type of newspaper, and listen to one type of voice, without being indecisive. If we can do this, many difficult problems will be solved easily.

As Mr. Lu Xun said, if there are "taboos" in reading, reading two opposite books at the same time will cause the positive and negative to cancel each other out due to the incompatible qualities, which is equivalent to not reading. Then, the "eight-legged essay method" is even more miraculous. In this way, the places where we should rely on the "eight-legged essay" to deal with people, write articles, and speak are even more beyond words.

During the Anti-Japanese War, "roughnecks" always liked to use this logic to argue and scold with people: "Damn it, during the Anti-Japanese War, military affairs are the first priority, and I represent the country. If you insult me, you are insulting the country!" The other party often remained silent because of this. It can be seen that the pursuit of the eight-legged essay has long been widely popular, but it is especially urgently needed today.

But what should be stated is: the eight-legged essay has timeliness and mechanical locality, and its usage varies according to time and place. What was suitable in the past is not suitable today, and what is suitable in other places is not suitable here. When using it, we must try to adapt it!

### I Obtained a Line of Poetry About Broken Flowers in a Dream. I Woke Up and Suddenly Felt Something, So I Completed a Poem in Regular Verse to Express My Feelings

â Shou Juan

Since spring, I have often complained about the east wind, which is uncertain in its weather. The small grass is still green at will, and the broken flowers still bloom red with affection. The mountains and rivers are separated, but how far away are they? It is always empty when meeting is difficult. Day after day, I think of you and I am getting old. I will give my life to the vastness of the universe! Sent to Mr. Bao Tianxiao in Taiwan

(Rhyming with Yan Qiao)

The vast Central Plains has sunk, the wind and rain torment and encroach on each other. I envy you for leaving high footprints on Peng Island, and I, old, think of my heart in the desolate river. Nothing is better than planting bamboo to dispel boredom, and I am not allowed to go deep into the mountains because I love my home. When will we re-order a flower-watching appointment, and set up wine in front of the flowers to drink together in detail?

### A Bank Draft

â Pei Jing

(1)

The evening newspaper reported that the living index for the first half of March was 1339.36 times.

The living index has been published. Gold notes are jumping wildly, oil and rice are soaring, the stock market is rising, and the exchange rate is rising. Public utilities will have to be adjusted tomorrow. The index cannot keep up with prices, and the base salary is too small. Half a month's income is not enough to pay off debts. Dumai has risen above the 40,000 mark, and silver dollars are selling for 4,800 yuan. I have a headache in the office.

"Old Zhang, go inside to get your salary."

"Oh," I walked into the accounting office and got my salary bag for this month. I felt very strange. Why is it so thin? So light? I suspiciously opened it, and it was a 35,000 yuan bank draft!

Is this half month of hard work just a piece of waste paper?

Cash has been particularly short these days, but I need cash! First, I owe the landlady the rent calculated in four dou of rice; second, I borrowed three big heads from the company's cook, and I agreed to pay them back after payday. If I break my promise for the first time, it will be difficult to open my mouth to him again if I need it urgently next time.

In the accounting office, I stared blankly at the bank draft.

"There is very little cash, and the banks are short of cash." The accountant told me seriously. I originally wanted to discuss it with him, but he said it first, which made me embarrassed to open my mouth. So, I had to walk out of the accounting office silently.

(2)

Who else has cash?

I thought of Little Wang: "Brother, do you have cash? Can you think of a way to get this bank draft?"

"Cash? The money I buy cigarettes with is still arranged by the tea room."

Little Wang mentioned the tea room, and I remembered that he often had extra money for delivering goods, maybe he would have cash. I decided to go to him to set up a plan. Unexpectedly, he had just gone out to deliver goods, and there was no fixed time for his return.

Secretary Gu usually has a lot of dealings with banks and is very popular outside. It might be a good idea to try to find him. Damn it! He is on the phone. "...The company issues salary in bank drafts. Ah! Where is there any cash? Hey! No..." Secretary Gu said on the phone.

I pushed the door in, but he didn't notice. I happened to hear this phone call, so why bother asking for trouble? So, I quietly returned.

The tea room has already returned. I hurried over.

"Hey! Is there a way to exchange this bank draft for cash?"

He was stunned, looked at the face of the draft and said: "The amount is not enough, I only have more than 5,000 yuan."

"Then are you free to buy three big heads?"

He nodded, took the bank draft, and walked out.

It was dark, and everyone in the company had gone home. I was still waiting.

The tea room came back and said: "Buying silver dollars requires cash, not bank drafts."

I walked to the tobacco shop myself: "Buy a carton of Bank Brand cigarettes." The boss saw me take out a bank draft and said with a smile: "The change needs to be calculated at 10% off, otherwise, buy all cigarettes."

"God! This bank draft ah..."

(3)

The next morning, I was still sleeping in bed. The landlady deliberately smiled and said: "The price of rice has risen by another 7,000 yuan today." She said and smiled again.

However, I can't blame him for this mocking speech. It's just that I owe people rent money, which is not good.

I quickly went to my cousin's shop and begged him to exchange cash to help me out. He promised to pick it up in the afternoon, and my heart was finally half at peace. Along the way, I inquired about the price of silver coins. The big head has already sold for 5,000 yuan! I hope it doesn't rise again.

In the afternoon, I asked the company for leave to get the money. Fortunately, because of our good relationship, there was no discount, and I got 35,000 yuan in cash. I brought the money back.

(4)

I hurried to buy the big heads. When I walked to the corner of Henan Road, the new price list was posted again.

"Big head sold for 6,500."

"Can you make it cheaper?" I asked.

"How many are you buying?"

"Buy three big heads, how much?"

"19,000 yuan, is it cheap?"

I paid him 19,000 yuan and bought three big heads. Under the dim sunlight, the three big heads were shining in my hand.

The evening newspaper news came again: "Dumai has risen above the 50,000 mark."

I took out the remaining 16,000 yuan and calculated the price of four dou of rice: this number made me shiver in the evening breeze.
