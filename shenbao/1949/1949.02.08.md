### Yan Huiqing and Others Head to Beiping for Negotiations; CCP Officially Replies Yesterday; Gan Jihou's Accompanying Trip Rejected; Nanjing People's Peace Delegation Awaits Meeting in Equality

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The Shanghai Peace Delegation, including Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, Jiang Yong, Hou Debang, Ouyuan Huai, and Ling Xianyang, is scheduled to fly from Shanghai to Beiping on the 9th. Gan Jihou, who came to Nanjing from Shanghai to consult with Acting President Li, has been meeting with Li and discussing matters with Shao Lizi and others for the past two days. Mr. Gan is scheduled to fly back to Shanghai on the morning of the 8th. Mr. Shao will remain in Nanjing. As of the evening of the 7th, it had not been decided whether he would accompany Yan and the others to Beiping. It is possible that a decision will be made after Zhang Zhizhong arrives in Nanjing.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] Political figures here say that the CCP's broadcast on the evening of the 7th, rejecting Gan Jihou's trip to Beiping, will not have a decisive impact on the Shanghai delegation's trip. Mr. Gan had originally decided to fly to Beiping on the 9th with the Shanghai Peace Delegation. However, since the CCP has frankly rejected him, whether he will still accompany the Shanghai Peace Delegation will be decided after discussions with the delegation upon his return to Shanghai on the 8th.

[Central News Agency, this city] After arriving in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 6th, government peace representative Huang Shaohong visited Yan Huiqing and others on the 7th to exchange views. Furthermore, Mr. Huang Qihan, a legislator who had previously flown to Beiping on behalf of Acting President Li for negotiations, also arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing. He had discussions with Mr. Huang Shaohong yesterday. It is reported that Mr. Huang Qihan will accompany the six-member delegation led by Yan Huiqing to Beiping to assist with the proceedings.

[United Press, Beiping, 7th] The Nanjing People's Peace Delegation is still awaiting a meeting with CCP leaders. It is widely rumored that professors and others have had contact with senior CCP leaders. However, it is understood that they have not yet met with Beiping Mayor Ye Jianying or any other important Communist Party members. It is rumored that Ye and other major CCP figures plan to host a banquet for the professors on the evening of the 7th, but this action is not politically significant, merely a formality. Several foreign reporters attempted to contact the delegation without success. Reporters drove to the Xijiao Airport on the morning of the 7th to visit Chinese reporters in the delegation but were politely refused by CCP guards.

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 7th] According to China National Aviation Corporation, the special plane carrying the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation safely arrived at Beiping Xiyuan Airport at 4:00 PM on the 6th. When the plane landed, the airport garrison fired three shots, the purpose of which is unknown. The plane will remain in Beiping at the request of the delegation.

### CCP Radio Broadcast Original Text

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco Broadcast: Shaanbei CCP radio, broadcast on the 7th, the CCP spokesperson's reply to the Shanghai Peace Delegation's trip to Beiping, saying that if Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, and others travel in a private capacity, Beiping Mayor Ye Jianying is prepared to receive them. However, if their mission is to "knock on the door" for peace talks and urge the CCP to quickly appoint representatives, they are not prepared to receive them. At the same time, Gan Jihou's trip to Beiping is rejected.

The original text of the CCP broadcast is as follows:

"According to a Shanghai dispatch on the 5th from the Central News Agency of the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government: 'Gan Jihou stated that the peace delegation organized by Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, and six others will fly to Beiping within two or three days. Shao Lizi and he will accompany them in a private capacity to assist. Mr. Gan stated that the delegation's sole mission is to knock on the door, urging the central government to quickly appoint peace representatives and determine the time and location for peace talks, so that the government delegation can go and begin peace negotiations.' The CCP spokesperson declared: If Shanghai's Mr. Yan Huiqing, Mr. Zhang Shizhao, and others are traveling to Beiping in a private capacity to visit and discuss national affairs, then Beiping Mayor General Ye Jianying is prepared to receive them. If, as Mr. Gan Jihou stated, 'The delegation's sole mission is to knock on the door, urging the CCP to quickly appoint peace representatives and determine the time and location for peace talks, so that the government delegation can go and begin peace negotiations,' then the CCP has already stated that preparations for peace talks are not yet complete, and there is no basis for discussion at present. We are not prepared to receive anyone for the time being. As for political opportunists like Gan Jihou who engage in "peace offensives," he is only qualified to sell his "peace offensive signboard" of American-made cheap goods in the Nanjing-Shanghai area. The people's Beiping does not welcome this kind of stuff. Sorry, please stop! If Gan Jihou dares to sneak into Beiping to peddle his private goods, then the people of Beiping will likely deport him."

### Rumor That Fu Zuoyi Has Been Arrested is Untrue

The People's Daily today published a lengthy account of the Hankou massacre, but made no mention of foreign news. The same is true for other newspapers. Newsboys were frustrated as sales plummeted.

### Kuomintang Central Expanded Memorial Week Solemnly Held in Guangzhou Yesterday; Presidents Yu and Sun Call for Innovation Within the Party; After the Meeting, Attendees Go to the Tomb of the Yellow Flower Mound Martyrs to Lay Flowers and Pay Tribute

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th] The Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters held an expanded memorial week solemnly at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall on the morning of the 7th. Yu Youren presided, and Sun Ke reported. Mr. Sun called on party comrades to strengthen their beliefs, implement the Three Principles of the People, and carry out the great cause of the revolution in order to strive for lasting peace. He also reiterated his determination not to be humiliated or surrender, and to work hard for the realization of peace talks under the leadership of Acting President Li. This Central Expanded Memorial Week is the first since the government moved to Guangzhou to operate. In the magnificent Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, the memorial ceremony was extremely solemn. The attendees stood in front of the Founder's portrait and will engraved in marble and silently remembered the Founder's great achievements. The entire hall was silent, with only the sounds of birds chirping in the distance. Kuomintang elder Yu Youren called on his comrades at the meeting to create a new era for the party. His heartfelt and sincere remarks were very moving. After the meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM, all the attendees went to the Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound to lay flowers and pay tribute, with Mr. Yu presiding. Those who attended the memorial week and paid tribute this morning included Yu Youren, Zou Lu, Sun Ke, Tong Guanxian, Wu Tiecheng, Li Shizeng, Liu Jianqun, Dong Qingyun, Ma Chaojun, Shen [missing character] Lian, Wu Zhimei, Wang Qijiang, Liu Weizhi, Pang Songzhou, Xu Kan, Liu Jiwen, Li Weiguo, Zheng Yanfen, Duanmu Kai, Yan Huatang, [missing number] Wu Shangying, Zhong Tianxin, Huang Bodu, Dai Kuisheng, Chen Zidong, Hong Lanyou, Li Dachao, Yu Junxian, Lin Yizhong, Lu Youshan, Su Tongzi, and more than five hundred others. The speeches of Mr. Yu and Mr. Sun are briefly recorded below:

President Yu Youren, in his speech at the Central Expanded Memorial Week on the morning of the 7th, called on Kuomintang comrades to create a new era, reform the atmosphere, and start by improving their personal lifestyles. The entire audience warmly welcomed him. Mr. Yu stated: When I left Nanjing, a reporter asked me if this trip to Guangzhou was to invite President Sun back to Nanjing. I replied "no," because President Sun had already said in Shanghai that he would travel between Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou as needed. Therefore, there was no need to invite him back to Nanjing. This trip to Guangzhou is because the government agencies have moved to Guangzhou to operate, so this is my first trip to the south after the war, and I am taking the opportunity to inspect. The country is facing serious difficulties today, but I believe that military victories and defeats are not worth discussing. As long as we do not fail spiritually, we will never fail. In the past, under the leadership of the great Sun Yat-sen, our party overcame several major difficulties and never failed. The past is over today. From now on, we must create a new era and thoroughly implement the Three Principles of the People. Let's all work together. If we want to create a new era, we must first improve our personal lives, and then extend it to all aspects of the military and administration. All my colleagues should unite as one to create this new era. Everyone must have the spirit of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound and continue to complete the revolutionary cause of the martyrs.

President Sun, in his report at the Central Memorial Week, stated: In the past six months, due to the spread of war, the overall situation has undergone serious changes, and the people have suffered greatly. All of this is due to the errors, failures, and unreasonable phenomena of the past, which planted the seeds for today's serious situation. We know that China needs the Three Principles of the People. If the Three Principles of the People cannot be realized one day, then China's problems will never be solved. Recalling that twenty years ago, the President personally entrusted the Three Principles of the People to our party, hoping that they could be gradually implemented. If they had been implemented, the current unmanageable situation would not have developed. What is even more, when we observe how the CCP can seduce and anesthetize the people, it is nothing more than using a part of the Principle of the People's Livelihood of the Three Principles of the People, that is, the equalization of land ownership, as a slogan. We should be deeply ashamed, strengthen our vigilance, and re-examine our past mistakes. (Continued on page 2)

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 7th] Confirmed information: Sun Yuanliang had a long-distance phone call with Sun Zhen. The Communist army has sneaked to a place 90 li away from Yichang.

### The Communist Army's Active Preparations to Cross the Yangtze River: Assembling and Building a Large Number of Wooden Boats in the Gaoyou and Hongze Lake Area; Navy Defeats Communist Troops West of Wuhu

[Our Zhenjiang-based correspondent, 7th] It has been learned that the Communist army is indeed actively gathering forces and building a large number of wooden boats in the Gaoyou and Hongze lakes and canal area. Some of these boats are motor-powered sampans, indicating their intention to actively prepare for crossing the Yangtze River. Furthermore, since the Communist army occupied Yangzhou, over seventy people have been arrested as so-called "war criminals," and over ten in Bengbu. Some of these "war criminals" were denounced by the people, but most were reportedly exposed by underground Communist members. The "war criminals" include people from all walks of life, including business, industry, education, and government.

[Our Nanjing-based correspondent, 7th] Communist troops harassing the area of Fenghuangjing and Yaogou on the north bank of the Yangtze River, west of Wuhu, were attacked by naval vessels on the 6th. Fierce fighting occurred at Liujiadu. The Communist troops, under the intense naval bombardment, fled in disarray. The navy seized more than 30 large and small wooden boats from the Communist forces, along with 147 boatmen, 1,800 dan of rice, 130 dan of soybeans, 400 dan of unhusked rice, and 100 dan of salt. The navy is still searching the area.

[Our Nanjing-based correspondent, 7th] A senior military official recently commented on a report in the local newspapers stating that on the 2nd of this month, the Nationalist army sank over 50 Communist wooden boats attempting to cross the Yangtze River near Jiangyin and captured over 700. He said that the report was pure fabrication, without any basis in reality. The area near Jiangyin is a key Nationalist army fortress. Even if the Communist army were to attempt to cross the Yangtze River, there is no reason they would choose to approach a fortress to be killed. Furthermore, this office has no knowledge of foreign reports that Chen Yi's 4th Column has been moving in the areas of Hexian, Hanshan, and Chaoxian for several days. However, the Nationalist army did voluntarily abandon Chaoxian and Hanshan at the end of January. Hexian, as well as Wuwei, Anqing, Wangjiang, Susong, and Qianjiang, are still firmly defended by Liu Ruming's Nationalist troops.

[Our Zhenjiang-based correspondent, 7th] According to people arriving from Huaiyin, after the Nationalist army withdrew from Huaiyin and Huai'an, the Communist army renamed the two cities as the Lianghuai Municipal Area. Recently, the Communist troops have been withdrawing northward in large numbers. According to a Communist cadre's unintentional revelation, the reasons are: (1) Reorganization and replenishment; (2) To ease the military situation.

[Our Nanjing-based correspondent, 7th] All Nationalist army units defending the south bank of the Yangtze River downstream from Dongliu have completed their strongest preparations. The defenses upstream from Dongliu are also largely completed. To strengthen the defense forces along the Yangtze River, the Nationalist army proactively withdrew from Haimen and Qidong on the 3rd. However, the bridgehead positions at Qinglonggang, Wutiaogang, etc., south of these two cities, as well as Chongming Island, are still being firmly defended by the Nationalist army.

[Our Suzhou-based correspondent, 7th] The 202nd Division of the Youth Army stationed in Suzhou has recently received orders to move to Chongming for defense. Liu Zigao, the commander of the 296th Division of the 52nd Army stationed in Qijiawan, will be transferred to Suzhou to garrison the city. As the 202nd Division is urgently departing, before Liu's troops arrive in Suzhou, the 2nd Detachment of the Wuxian Security Brigade will temporarily be responsible for the defense of the city, and County Magistrate Zhu will act as the commander.

[Our Changshu-based correspondent, 7th] The Nantong Command Post has been ordered to be renamed the Suzhou Command Post. Director Gu convened a symposium on the 7th, gathering the heads of various government agencies and the persons in charge of various organizations to make important decisions on the current defense and the immediate problems.

[Our Changshu-based correspondent, 7th] Chen Xiefu, the city defense commander, took office on the morning of the 7th and set out to inspect the city's defense works.

Editorial

### How to Promote National Peace?

The Shanghai Municipal Council issued a telegram on January 8th, initiating the National Peace Promotion Association, inviting representatives from provincial and municipal councils and national organizations to come to Shanghai for consultation. It has received endorsements from many units. Today, a preparatory meeting will be held first to exchange views, and a formal meeting will be held on the 10th. It is reported that Dr. Yan Huiqing and five other representatives flying to Peiping in a private capacity have also been invited to participate in the consultation today. In today's situation where the calls for peace talks are both near and far, our people will surely place considerable hope on this potentially soon-to-be-established Peace Promotion Association.

The current question is: How exactly should national peace be promoted?

Some may believe that there is not much hope in talking peace with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) today. There are two reasons for this: (1) The CCP is now in a state of complacency and arrogance. This can be inferred from the CCP's broadcasts in recent days, which show that they not only do not have the Nationalist government in their eyes, but they also do not see the people. They believe that the people are merely a facade, a plaything. No matter how the people "lament and appeal," it cannot move their hearing. (2) Wang Chuanshan once said in his historical discourse, "The relationship between people relies on trust and righteousness. The application of trust and righteousness is only for the relationship between people; it has not been heard of applying trust and righteousness to tigers, wolves, and dolts." Duke Xiang of Song upheld trust and righteousness in his alliance with Chu, and he upheld trust and righteousness in his war with Chu, but he was defeated and wounded, and he became a disgrace to China. If that was the case with Chu, how much more so with those who associate with the Di and harm others?" It can be seen that in order to have peace talks, there must first be trust and righteousness. To talk peace with those who fundamentally do not value trust and righteousness is like trying to obtain fish from a tree.

However, based on the principle of "doing good with everyone," we are unwilling to take this view. We always believe that the leaders and members of the CCP are all humans with square feet, all possess "human nature," and are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor, belonging to the same "compatriots." Fearing the warning of brothers quarreling within the walls, they should rein in their horses at the edge of the cliff and leave some goodwill with the people. Moreover, the CCP repeatedly uses "liberating the people" as its slogan, so the people's plea for a ceasefire and peace talks should not be ignored. Otherwise, how will they explain themselves? Therefore, even though the CCP's broadcasts continue to call the government's request for peace talks a "peace trick" [peaceful offensive], and even though they scold "political brokers like Gan Jieshou who are engaged in peace offensives," they cannot help but say that they are "prepared to receive" Dr. Yan Huiqing and others flying to Peiping. From this, we believe that as long as the people can truly value their position and demonstrate their power, the people are qualified to promote peace.

Then, what methods should the people use to promote national peace? Most importantly, we must at least achieve the following three points:

(1) Make every effort to promote a ceasefire. The only hope of the common people at present is that both sides stop fighting. Because without a clear declaration of a ceasefire, the state of war will exist for one more day, which will threaten the daily lives of the people for one more day. It is like two people fighting. We must first persuade each other to let go of their hands, and then we can hope that their hearts will gradually calm down and their tempers will gradually improve. After fighting for so many years, not to mention that the common people have suffered terribly, both sides may not be exhausted. Moreover, what the CCP hopes for is nothing more than political power, and what it calls for is nothing more than revolution. If they can stop fighting and resolve to work together to agree on a comprehensive new policy that suits the national conditions and carry out a bloodless revolution in all aspects of politics, economy, and society, then the CCP does not need to sacrifice the people to achieve its goals. So, why not do it? Therefore, people's organizations on both sides should immediately recommend a number of impartial and selfless representatives to the front lines to earnestly request both sides' troops to immediately cease fire on the spot to facilitate the progress of peace talks. The people's representatives can kneel and beg, or they can fast, until their request is granted. This is the true public opinion! Whoever does not want a ceasefire has no people in their heart.

(2) Maintain law and order first. While we request a ceasefire, we must strive for stability. Therefore, maintaining local law and order is a major step in striving for peace. The method of maintaining law and order should start from the root. Chairman Ma Hongda put it well, "We should liberate ourselves today and revolutionize ourselves. We must unite and work from the standpoint of the people, protect the Northwest with the strength of the Northwest, and promote national progress." Therefore, first of all, civil and military officials must not be greedy for money or afraid of death. In particular, generals must share the joys and sorrows with their soldiers. Only generals who share the joys and sorrows with their soldiers can have strict military discipline, and only with strict military discipline can law and order be maintained. Secondly, wealthy families should think about the lives of the working masses without being forced, and they should use their surplus to make up for the deficiencies of others. In particular, they should quickly donate as much as possible so that soldiers can be well-fed and warmly clothed, and farmers, laborers, and public educators can maintain a decent standard of living. And the wealthy families not only have an unshirkable duty to do this, but they should also take the lead in advocating it. "When the granaries are full, people know etiquette; when they have enough food and clothing, they know honor and guidance." This is the fundamental meaning of maintaining local law and order. Furthermore, we must give full play to the spirit of mutual assistance and self-defense, using local upright people, using local donations, training local youths, and protecting local lives and property. This is the only way to maintain local law and order. People in places that have not yet directly suffered from the war, such as the area around Shanghai, and the provinces south of the Yangtze River, should be greatly enlightened, seeing things early and taking precautions, and never simply seek remedies after the event.

(3) Awaken the national consciousness. We must, as ordinary people, broadly tell the people of the whole country, distribute leaflets, cry out loudly, and weep together, quickly awakening and not doing any more stupid things that kill each other. But it must be noted that in order to prevent killing, we must ensure that the attacking side no longer has people to provide them with tools for killing. We are all ordinary people, and we all want to live a peaceful life. Who wants to have their wives and children separated and their humanity extinguished! The world situation is changing rapidly, and a third world war could break out at any moment. If the Chinese people can quickly awaken and embark on the road of peaceful reunification, perhaps a third world war can be avoided or delayed, or at least it is hoped that it will not break out in China. Otherwise, it is hard to say, and no one knows how many millions of lives will be sacrificed! We want to awaken all compatriots from south to north and from east to west, regardless of gender, age, all together, to oppose civil war. We remember that "oppose civil war" and "oppose hunger" were the slogans that the CCP consistently shouted two or three years ago. Today, we also ask the compatriots in the CCP area to join us in quickly demanding that the CCP leaders practice these slogans, "oppose civil war, oppose hunger!"

### The Provincial Government of Taiwan Holds an Expanded Monthly Meeting; Chen Cheng Denounces Administrative Laxity; Speculative Profiteers Will Be Deported

[Our Taipei-based correspondent, 7th] The provincial government held its first expanded monthly meeting today, attended by over 3,000 civil servants, presided over by Chen Cheng. During the meeting, Chen strongly denounced the laxity of administrative efficiency and the bureaucratic habit of seeking to avoid mistakes rather than seeking to achieve merit, saying that it would not be allowed to exist. He said that the salaries of civil servants and teachers must be fully guaranteed to ensure their livelihood. Chen attributed the recent soaring prices entirely to artificial manipulation. He cited an example, saying that Taiwan has enough yarn for five years of use, but prices are rising endlessly. If this is not the work of profiteers, what is it? Chen stated in a firm tone that Taiwan will not allow speculative profiteers. In the future, if they are discovered, they will be deported immediately.

### Chen Yi Discusses the Political Situation, Believes Peace Requires Everyone's Efforts; Zhou Yan Appointed Hangzhou Garrison Commander

[Our Hangzhou-based correspondent, 7th] Zhejiang Province Chairman Chen met with our reporter alone on the 7th and discussed various aspects of the political situation for half an hour. Chen believes that peace is needed by the people of the whole country and that as long as everyone works hard, peace will surely come. He remains optimistic about the future of the country and believes that it will not adversely affect Zhejiang's ten-year plan. Zhou Yan has been appointed as the Hangzhou Garrison Commander and is currently being urged to take office. The headquarters will be established soon, and order in Hangzhou should gradually return to normal. Regarding the previous report that the 9th Division, trained by the Quzhou-Suihua Defense Headquarters in Zhejiang, has now been established as an army, with the commissioner concurrently serving as the army and division commander, Chen said that the facts are slightly different. An administrative inspector cannot concurrently serve as an army and division commander. Currently, due to the training location, the commissioner is temporarily holding the concurrent post. Once the army is established, the commissioner holding a military position must resign. Chen expressed strong agreement with the proposal to build Hangzhou into a cultural city, saying that a cultural city must be owned by the people and that an art museum can be established, but the collection of materials is still in progress.

Because the Xingye Company has repeatedly requested investment from the Four Banks without success, and its own economic strength is weak, the Economic Construction Committee is now establishing processing plants in the province and plans to establish chemical and sugar factories in Ganxian. If funds permit, it will also plan to establish a local products trading company.

### To Maintain Traffic on the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways, Mobile Military Law Enforcement Teams are Organized; Workers at Qishuyan Locomotive Factory Went on Strike Yesterday, Obstructing Trains on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line, Causing Delays

[Local News] Workers at the Qishuyan Locomotive Factory of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Bureau staged a strike yesterday afternoon, lying on the tracks to prevent trains from passing.

Some workers went on strike and some lay on the tracks to prevent trains from passing. After receiving the report, Director Wang Zhaohuai, who was in Shanghai, was extremely angry because the employees' demands were unreasonable and because they had gathered to strike and disrupt traffic without waiting for a response from the Bureau, and had beaten the union director and railway police. He immediately ordered Qian Hegao, the director of the police department, to lead a large number of railway police to suppress the strike. Zhou Yan, the director of the Wuxi Command of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters, also sent a large number of military police to the Qishuyan factory after receiving a report.

However, Zhang Hanying, the Dean of Academic Affairs, is unable to come to Taiwan due to circumstances in Shanghai and a new candidate is being sought.

### Nationalist Party Central Commemoration Week (Continued from above) (Page 1)

Today, both the nation and our party face a crisis of survival. To avert this crisis and prevent the interruption of our party's revolutionary cause, we must engage in deep self-reflection and awakening. Twenty years ago, Premier Sun Yat-sen led the National Revolution, which originated in Guangzhou. At that time, our province was not yet fully unified. What we relied on was only the support of a million people in Guangzhou. Yet, the warlords were eventually overthrown, and the Northern Expedition was completed, achieving unification. Today, although the Northeast and North China have successively fallen, and the Yangtze River is now facing the front lines, the government still holds the area south of the Yangtze River, maintaining the complete Southwest and Northwest regions, possessing a population of hundreds of millions. In terms of strength, it is incomparable to Premier Sun Yat-sen's training of 2,000 new troops at Whampoa in those years, laying the foundation for the Northern Expedition. The last opportunity for revival lies in a strong belief, understanding the people, integrating with the people, and coordinating national manpower and material resources to promote the Three Principles of the People. Since our party overthrew the warlords and reactionary forces and established a revolutionary regime, it has been more than twenty years. The spread of the communist forces is due to our failure to implement the ideology we believe in. The biggest mistake our party has made in the past is that some people within the party have been too superstitious of military force. Internally, they fought for power and influence, sitting idly by and watching the enemy seize opportunities to divide and alienate us. After the end of the eight-year war of resistance, which was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to achieve peaceful unification, the government also had plans to resolve domestic disputes through political means. Unfortunately, they could not be thoroughly implemented. After years of war, the people were exhausted and longed for rest. The re-emergence of warfare made people's lives miserable and painful, which also affected the morale of the soldiers, leading to military setbacks step by step. President Chiang Kai-shek, in accordance with the wishes of the people and recognizing that military methods could not solve the problem, issued a proclamation on New Year's Day, calling for peace and explaining the importance of peace for the nation and the people. The government also gradually adopted some measures and steps. Later, on January 19, Mao Zedong put forward eight conditions. Soon, the Executive Yuan decided that both sides should first cease fire unconditionally and appoint representatives to conduct negotiations. After President Chiang Kai-shek's retirement, the Executive Yuan appointed peace representatives on the 22nd, preparing to negotiate with the communist side at any time. However, until now, the representatives have not been able to depart. The communist side's delay in appointing representatives and their continuous postponement show that they are also superstitious of military force, believing that they are now fully fledged and can conquer the country by force. Therefore, they refuse to cease fire first, and their intentions are very obvious. What I must solemnly point out here is that in order to achieve lasting peace, both sides must negotiate on an equal footing, and the conditions should be fair and reasonable, acceptable to the people of the whole country. The Communist Party cannot force us to surrender in a victorious posture and accept its conditions completely. The fact that our government is recognized by all countries in the world as the only government representing the Republic of China is completely denied by the Communist Party. It must be known that China's stability is closely related to world peace. China's chaos is very likely to cause another world war. In order to seek the realization of domestic peace and avoid the threat of world war, we should all strive for true democratic peace. All my comrades, are even more duty-bound. As for any humiliating and submissive peace, it is absolutely unacceptable (applause). The current government has moved to Guangzhou to work. We should re-examine the past. Acting President Li Zongren is currently staying in Beijing to seek peace and personally went to Shanghai to invite Shanghai social leaders to go to Beijing to promote peace talks, all of which show the sincerity of the government in seeking peace. As for whether the pursuit of peace can be effective, although we are not very optimistic, we do not need to be pessimistic either. As long as all comrades unite and strengthen our faith, even if there are many difficulties and the future may encounter setbacks and sacrifices, I believe that the goal of peace can still be achieved. The attainment of peace, apart from military methods, is political methods. Acting President Li Zongren prefers the latter, and we also prefer the latter. In short, Acting President Li Zongren is the head of state. No matter how the peace talks develop, our party comrades should unite under the leadership of Acting President Li Zongren and do our best (party voices). (End)

### Soviet Union Pressures Norway Amidst Calls, Important Talks Commence Between the US and Norway, Norway's Determination to Follow the Western Path is Evident, Swedish and Danish Envoys Meet with Acheson to Explain Their Respective Positions

[United Press International, Washington, 7th] Norway began important meetings with US officials on the 7th to determine whether Norway will reject the Soviet Union and join the Western countries' non-communist collective defense alliance. As the Soviet Union issued a second warning to Norway, instructing it not to join the proposed North Atlantic Security Treaty, the US-Norway negotiations have new importance in the East-West Cold War.

[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange arrived here yesterday amid concerns in his country about the Soviet Union's sudden request to conclude a non-aggression treaty, to inquire about the US government's attitude so that he can decide which of the two uninvited plans, American or Soviet, to defend Norway against aggression is more appropriate. It is expected that Secretary of State Acheson will ask him to join the North Atlantic Treaty and stand on the side of the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Although officials expressed doubt whether Acheson would offer special advice on the course Norway should take, it is believed that Acheson will likely explain that it is best for Norway to reject the Soviet request in order to safeguard its own interests, and will assure Lange that if Norway participates in the North Atlantic Treaty, the United States will not need any bases in Norway.

[United Press International, Washington, 7th] The Norwegian Foreign Minister said upon arriving in Washington on the 7th: "I have come to the United States to find out what kind of security Norway will have if we join the North Atlantic Treaty, and what kind of obligations Norway will assume." According to US authorities, Norway also knows that the price of joining the treaty will not be too high. The treaty has a common guarantee that the signatory countries will jointly defend themselves, discouraging aggressors.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 7th] Foreign observers here today predicted that the Soviet Union may follow the approach taken with Norway and suggest concluding non-aggression treaties with Sweden and Denmark.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th, United Press] Swedish Ambassador Boheman and Danish Ambassador Kauffmann have scheduled meetings with Secretary of State Acheson. It is understood that the two will not meet with Acheson at the same time as the Norwegian Foreign Minister, but will go to the State Department separately to urge the United States to give more sympathetic consideration to other countries in the Scandinavian Peninsula that do not directly participate in the Atlantic Treaty. Negotiations on the Scandinavian Defense Pact broke down last week because Norway declared its intention to participate in the Atlantic Treaty. The Swedish and Danish ambassadors will ask the United States to revise its previous policy and provide military assistance to countries that are united to resist aggression but do not participate in the Atlantic Alliance.

### North Atlantic Security Treaty Has No Intention of Inviting the Soviet Union to Participate, McNeil Answers Questions from British Members of Parliament

[Report from this newspaper] London, 7th Broadcast: During today's meeting of the British House of Commons, left-wing Labor Party Member of Parliament Pradmeier denounced the North Atlantic Treaty as an "aggressive pact" and asked whether the government intended to invite the Soviet Union to participate in the treaty. Minister of State McNeil replied "No," and said that if the Soviet government had not made it impossible to achieve collective security under the United Nations with various obstacles, suspicions, and uncooperative attitudes, then the treaty would not be needed at all.

McNeil denied that the treaty conflicted with Britain's obligations to the United Nations and said, "Collective security" is actually the meaning of peace. Another Labor Party member, Chamberlain, then said: Since both Truman and Stalin have clearly expressed their willingness to meet, is the British government willing to have them meet in London? British Prime Minister Attlee replied, "Neither Truman nor Stalin has formally contacted me about this, so I think it is unnecessary to do so."

### Churchill Will Serve as British Representative to the European Parliament

[Report from this newspaper] London, 7th Broadcast: British officials are currently planning the organization of the European Parliament and considering the position that Churchill may hold in the parliament. The European Parliament will be divided into two parts. One part is the Council of Ministers, to which Britain will only send one representative, appointed by a government spokesperson such as Foreign Secretary Bevin. The other part is the Consultative Assembly, in which Britain will send a majority of representatives to participate. Supporters of Churchill hope that he will be one of the representatives. However, senior British officials are deeply concerned that even if Churchill holds an important position in the lower house of parliament, he will certainly be able to manipulate the entire organization.

### Markos Seeks Refuge in Albania

Border Troubles Due to Poor Relations Between Yugoslavia and Albania

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 7th] It is widely rumored here that Markos, the commander-in-chief of the Greek guerrillas, has come to Yugoslavia to seek refuge. Official sources were quite shocked upon hearing this news, saying: They do not know where Markos has gone. It is said that Markos was recently removed from all his positions by the Greek Communist Party Politburo on the grounds of poor health.

[United Press International, Prague, 7th] Prague Radio broadcast tonight that "many Yugoslav spies" have been arrested in Albania. The broadcast quoted the Albanian News Agency as saying that in recent weeks, the Yugoslav border guards have crossed the Albanian border 25 times, and 16 Yugoslav aircraft and 4 ships have also violated Albanian territory.

### Egyptian-Israeli Armistice Negotiations May Lead to an Agreement

[United Press International, Tel Aviv, 7th] External sources recently predicted that the Egyptian-Israeli agreement could be agreed upon on Rhodes Island within 48 hours. According to usually reliable sources, Egypt has "greatly softened" since the beginning of the negotiations, and peace is in sight. Sasson, the Director of the Middle East Department of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, is scheduled to go to Rhodes Island on the 7th to resolve some minor issues that are hindering peace.

### Opening of the Socio-Economic Progress Council, New Zealand Elected as the Chairman of the General Assembly, the US Will Propose a Plan to Aid Backward Countries

[Report from this newspaper] Lake Success, New York, 7th Broadcast: The United Nations Economic and Social Council was inaugurated here. The 18 member states unanimously elected New Zealander Town as Chairman, succeeding Lebanese Malik. Town is currently the New Zealand High Commissioner to Canada.

[United Press International, Lake Success, 6th] According to inquiries, the United States may suggest a United Nations committee to plan President Truman's "Bold New Program" to help backward countries in the world. US officials are considering making this suggestion at the United Nations Economic and Social Council, which opens on the 7th.

Official sources also revealed that the United States will support international investigations into forced labor in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, and motions to investigate the existence of slavery and semi-slavery in various parts of the world. The American Federation of Labor has agreed to support the plan of several of the 18 countries on the Economic and Social Council to thoroughly study the situation of forced labor. US Chief Representative Assistant Secretary of State Thorp has considered the idea of establishing a special Economic and Social Council subcommittee. This committee will be responsible for studying world development plans and submitting detailed plans for the money needed for technical and backward country development at the next meeting.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 6th] The United Nations Economic and Social Council is scheduled to hold its eighth meeting here tomorrow. The Secretariat released a 52-page economic report last night stating that the world economic situation has generally improved.

### Rumors of Internal Strife in the Czech Government, Vyshinsky's Mission in Czechoslovakia Raises Defection Speculation

[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 6th] It is said that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky is still staying at the Karlovy Vary spa in the Czech Republic, which is quite surprising to people here. This is completely contrary to the official attitude, which says that it knows nothing about it. Every time a Soviet politician arrives in the Czech Republic, he is allowed to do whatever he wants, which inevitably leads to speculation. It is now widely rumored that a serious internal strife has occurred in the Czech government, and Moscow intends to send a mediator to resolve and eliminate it. It is said that there are differences of opinion between Czech President Gottwald and Prime Minister Zapotocky, as well as State Minister Svoboda and Communist Party Secretary General Slansky. Vyshinsky has always paid attention to issues related to Western Europe and the United Nations, and rarely hears about issues related to Eastern Europe and Central Europe. However, Vyshinsky's stay in Karlovy Vary, if not for health reasons, has been prolonged. The reason for this is unknown. Today, it is rumored that Vyshinsky has gone to the capital of Slovakia, but this has not yet been confirmed.

### Soviet Union Builds Underground Bomb Shelters in the Suburbs of Berlin

Equipped with Telephones Directly Connecting to Moscow

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 7th] According to the Berlin Telegraph, which is licensed by the British, the Soviet military authorities have built a huge underground bomb shelter in Rudersdorf, a suburb of Berlin. The bomb shelter is for the use of various agencies of the Soviet military government in the event of changes in the international situation. It is also said that more than 800 workers have been widening the tunnel for a whole year. The tunnel was built by the Germans during World War II as a shelter. The newspaper also pointed out that 370 rooms have now been built, each equipped with a telephone that connects directly to Moscow. The construction plan for the storage rooms is based on the original design of former Nazi Minister Speer. If necessary, there will also be a huge food storage depot, hospital, powerful generator, reservoir, and ventilation equipment, which will allow the Soviet military to last for weeks when surrounded by the outside world.

### Royal Arrives in Seoul, Scheduled to Fly to Okinawa, Guam, and Other Places Tonight to Return to the US, Before Leaving, He Criticized the Soviet Union for Enslaving Labor

[Associated Press, Seoul, 7th] US Secretary of the Army Royall arrived here from Japan at 5:41 last night. Korean Prime Minister Lee Beom-seok, US Ambassador Muccio, and US General Roberts went to the airport to welcome him. After inspecting the US military and the Korean military's guard of honor, Royall went to President Syngman Rhee's residence to receive hospitality. When entering the city, several battalions of the Korean army were on guard along the way. He is scheduled to leave here tomorrow night to go to Okinawa, Guam, Hawaii, and other places to return home.

Most of these slave laborers come from countries that the Soviet Union calls satellite states."

### Various Private Universities and Colleges That Have Not Started School Have Agreed to Calculate Tuition and Miscellaneous Fees in Rice, With the Principle of Collecting Between Three and a Half Stones and Four and a Half Stones at a Time

[Report from this newspaper] Private university and college presidents held a symposium at the Tsinghua Alumni Association yesterday afternoon. More than 20 people attended, including Zhao Xiuming from St. John's University, Ling Xianyang from Shanghai University, Liao Shishui from Kwang Hua University, Wang Yuxiang from Great China University, Sheng Zhenwei from Soochow University, and Wang Yukai from Kwang Hsia Business College. In addition to the four schools that have already started school, St. John's, Shanghai University, Tatung University, and Soochow University, the tuition and miscellaneous fee standards for other schools that are about to start school have been decided to be based on the principle of 3.5 to 4.5 stones of rice. Schools that start school this week will convert according to the reported rice price. The conversion method for schools that start school next week will be decided at a temporary meeting next Monday. The principle is to collect tuition and miscellaneous fees in one lump sum, which will be determined by each school based on its own circumstances.

### School Opening and Class Dates

The decision to maintain the original proposal for school opening and class dates, that is, from February 14 to February 21. Kwang Hua has scheduled to open school on the 10th and start classes on the 17th. Great China will open school on the 11th and start classes on the 21st. Aurora will register from the 11th and start classes on the 15th. Soochow will register on the 14th and start classes on the 18th. Kwang Hsia Business College will register on the 18th and start classes on the 21st. The registration fee for new students is set at 150 to 250 yuan. Every effort will be made to facilitate the request of students from Nankai University in Tianjin to go south to study, and incomplete documents can be supplemented later.

### St. John's, Tatung, and Soochow Charge Fees According to the Index

The current situation of the four universities that have already started school is as follows: (1) St. John's charges fees in three installments, with each installment calculated based on a base salary of 32 yuan multiplied by the cost of living index. The first installment is calculated based on 18.3 times the lower period of December last year. The second installment is determined to be based on the cost of living index for the upper period of February, without considering conversion based on the price of rice. (2) The tuition and miscellaneous fees for Shanghai University are a total of 4.5 stones of rice, which was converted into a one-time payment based on the then rice price of 1,250 yuan per stone at the time of school opening. (3) Tatung University charges fees in three installments, with each installment calculated based on a base salary of 33.3 yuan multiplied by the index. The first installment is charged according to the lower period index of December last year, and the second installment is being considered for conversion based on the price of rice, but no decision has been made yet. (4) The Soochow Law School charges fees in two installments. The first installment is calculated based on a base salary of 48 yuan multiplied by the cost of living index for the upper period of January. The method for charging the second installment has not yet been determined.

### Issues Concerning Tuition Fees at Public and Private Schools: Final Decision to be Made Today; Mayor to Invite Council Members and School Representatives for Further Consultation

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the tuition fee issues at various public and private schools in the city, after the Education Bureau convened a consultation on the 5th at Yucai Middle School with the Council, the Teachers' Association, and representatives from various schools, it was decided unanimously to charge fees based on rice prices, as the cost of living index cannot keep up with commodity prices. However, Councilors Jiang Huaisu and Zhang Zhongyuan argued that the interests of the majority of poor students should be considered and firmly advocated for collecting tuition fees based on the cost of living index. In order to determine a reasonable fee standard, Mayor Wu decided to convene another meeting at 10:00 AM today in the City Hall conference room, inviting representatives from the City Council and various schools for consultation, after which a final decision will be made.

Tuition in Rice: Councilors Oppose

Councilor Jiang Hao submitted a written statement to Mayor Wu yesterday, stating that he was shocked to hear that the city's public and private primary schools are considering using rice as the unit of calculation for tuition fees. He pointed out that rice prices have recently soared unreasonably, and market prices are constantly changing. Most primary school students come from poor families who cannot afford this heavy burden. Furthermore, the collection and payment of public and private fees should, in accordance with laws and principles, be based on the national currency. Setting the bad precedent of collecting fees in rice would severely damage the financial system, and the future would be unimaginable. He urged the Mayor to consider the unbearable suffering of the citizens, strictly prohibit this practice, and devise other appropriate measures.

### Two Unlawful Soldiers Executed by Firing Squad for Viewing a Play Without Tickets and Killing a Military Policeman

[Report from Our Newspaper] Qin Guangzhi and Gu Kai, soldiers from the 42nd Hospital of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, who threw hand grenades and shot and killed a military policeman at the entrance of the China Grand Theatre on January 3rd for a dispute over viewing a play without tickets, were sentenced to death by the Garrison Headquarters Military Law Office. After approval by the Ministry of National Defense, they were executed by firing squad at the Jiangwan execution ground at 5:00 PM yesterday, and their bodies were buried at the Pushan Villa.

Qin Guangzhi, 28 years old, from Sichuan; Gu Kai, 28 years old, from Sichuan. On January 3rd, at around 12:00 noon, the two, along with more than 30 soldiers from the same hospital, carrying hand grenades and bombs, went to the China Grand Theatre on Niuzhuang Road, intending to enter the theater without tickets. Military policemen Chen Zhongxin, Wen Ranzhong, and Jiang Yusheng, who were on duty at the scene, tried to dissuade them without success. Gu Kai then took the lead in carrying out violent acts, forcibly seizing the rifle of military policeman Chen Zhongxin, raising the gun and shooting at the military policemen at the upstairs window, and throwing a hand grenade at the entrance of the theater, which fortunately did not explode. Then, they abducted Chen Zhongxin. Qin Guangzhi, relying on his strength, seized the pistol of military policeman Wen Ranzhong and shot another military policeman, Jiang Yusheng, in the left chest, who fell to the ground and died on the spot. Subsequently, the Garrison Headquarters patrol team apprehended the two and sent them to the Military Law Office, where they were sentenced to death. The execution site was originally set at the entrance of the China Grand Theatre to serve as a warning, but later, due to concerns about traffic disruption in the daytime downtown area, it was changed to the Jiangwan execution ground after requesting instructions from Commander Chen.

### Shanghai Municipal Government Holds Second Monthly Meeting of the Year; Director of Finance Bureau Reports on Revenue and Expenditure

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Government held its second monthly meeting of the year yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, presided over by Mayor Wu. Director of the Finance Bureau, Tian Yongqian, delivered a work report, stating that the city's financial situation for the 37th year [1948] can be divided into two periods. The first period, from January to July, saw a barely balanced financial situation. The second period, from August to December, experienced extreme difficulties in the city's financial revenue due to the "August 19th" central currency reform. Fortunately, a one-time subsidy from the central government provided some support. The property tax and business tax rates were adjusted in September and October of the 37th year, making revenue and expenditure relatively stable. However, from November to December, due to fluctuations in commodity prices, revenue remained the same, while employee salaries and other expenses increased, resulting in a significant monthly deficit. Regarding the issue of increasing tax revenue, adjustments have never been made lightly unless otherwise stipulated by the central government. He concluded that the city's financial difficulties will continue to be numerous in the future. Mayor Wu stated that he is very concerned about the difficult lives of his colleagues in the city government. Before the central government decides on an adjustment method, the city government has decided to double the salaries of public school teachers and civil servants for February based on the standard of the previous month. The monthly meeting adjourned at 9:50 AM.

### Travel Industry Workers Petition Yesterday, Arguing for Adjustments to Housing Allowances

[Report from Our Newspaper] The wages of hotel and inn workers are related to room prices. Recently, the Municipal Government decided not to allow housing allowances to be factored into pricing during municipal meetings, but instead to adjust them based on the cost of living index. Workers believe this will affect their livelihood. Yesterday morning, Feng Yaying, Chairman of the Workers' Union, and Zhou Xuexiang, Chairman of the General Labor Union, petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau. Department Director Shen Ding and Section Chief Zhang Chude met with them and the petitioners raised two points: (1) The city government's handling of hotel price negotiation matters is based on the resolution of the City Council, which ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to handle it. The Social Affairs Bureau then invited relevant agencies to negotiate room prices. Now, the municipal meeting has rejected the agreement, which is obviously inconsistent with the previous order. (2) Adjusting room prices based on the cost of living index is unreasonable. The index reflects the rate of increase in past prices, while the expenses of the hotel industry, such as water, electricity, and soap, are real-time. Moreover, some expenses in the hotel industry's costs are not included when compiling the index. Therefore, adjusting room prices based on the index is not practical. Department Director Shen and Section Chief Zhang agreed to submit these opinions to Deputy Director Zhao for forwarding to the city government.

### Chinese Employees of American President Lines Raise Five Demands for Priority Treatment

### Two Shipping Industry Groups Telegraph the Communist Party, Requesting the Maintenance of Shipping Rights

We have sent two telegrams, Zi You and Zi Gan. Meanwhile, the Kailuan Mining Bureau has reached an agreement with our association to transport 100,000 tons of coal south in exchange for 300,000 bags of flour, which will be transported back and forth by the 'Da Shanghai' and 'Tangshan' ships, along with mail. We are currently processing the matter. Today's *North-China Daily News* reported that the British company Swire Group's ship *Hunan* has arrived in Tanggu, with news stating that Chinese ships from Central and Southern China will not be allowed to return to their original ports of departure when sailing to North China ports. Restoring shipping and developing production is the unanimous desire of our entire nation. The shipping industry and crew groups are willing to restore transportation with the greatest enthusiasm to prevent imperialist aggression and protect the interests of the entire nation. This matter concerns rescuing people's livelihoods and maintaining shipping rights. We earnestly request a reply. Regards."

### Zhao Chen, Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice, Accused of Illegal Acts by Ministry Employees

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to news from the Shanghai judicial community, Chen Gemin, Chief Counselor of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, Counselor Wu Zehan, Director of Personnel Gu Ruxun, and over a hundred directors, section chiefs, and staff members of various divisions and departments of the Ministry, jointly submitted accusations to the Five Yuans [branches of government], accusing Zhao Chen, Political Vice Minister acting as Minister, of the following: "To the esteemed Yuan Presidents: Since Zhao Chen, Political Vice Minister of this Ministry, began acting as Minister, he has taken the opportunity of the central government's evacuation of personnel to abuse his power and appoint dozens of people based on personal relationships, violating official decrees. His handling of Ministry affairs is negligent and misguided, leading to constant disputes. Recently, he ordered his newly appointed commissioner, Yang Renfu, to bring armed personnel to the Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance, coercing responsible personnel to issue another payment order, taking the money and fleeing to Guangzhou with his family, abandoning over a hundred evacuated personnel in Beijing and Shanghai without leaving a penny or arranging for care, leaving them destitute and displaced. His personal Chief of the General Affairs Department, Gao Yuedai, first occupied a Ministry vehicle and secretly went to West Lake, where he is still enjoying himself in Hangzhou. Other issues, such as the severance of contact and command of courts and prisons in various provinces and cities, and the hunger strike of thousands of prisoners in Jiangsu and Shanghai, are ignored. Such a base, incompetent, and law-breaking person with no conscience is unworthy of leading the judiciary, let alone establishing judicial dignity. We earnestly request your Yuans to promptly consult with the Executive Yuan to dismiss and investigate Zhao Chen and appoint a virtuous and capable person to preside over Ministry affairs. The country would be fortunate, and the judiciary would be fortunate!"

### Most Ministry of Education Employees Remain in Shanghai; Food and Accommodation Problems Not Easily Resolved; Liaison Association Scheduled to Discuss Everything Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] After acting Minister Chen and a group of ten people from the Ministry of Education flew from Nanjing to Guangzhou, Vice Minister Tian Peilin also flew from Shanghai to Guangzhou three days ago. Except for some employees who were from Chongqing, Chengdu, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces and cities who were transferred to educational institutions and schools in various provinces and cities but were still paid by the Ministry of Education, 50-60 employees from Nanjing remained in Nanjing. The majority of the remaining employees have come to Shanghai, and they can be divided into several categories: (1) Those who have been assigned to work at the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau and various national schools and are still paid by the Ministry of Education. (2) Although they have been assigned to work in various provinces and cities outside Shanghai, they are stranded in Shanghai due to inconvenient transportation, lack of travel expenses, waiting for transportation, and exhaustion of travel funds. (3) Those who have not been assigned to work anywhere and are waiting for orders in Shanghai. This category has a larger number of people.

Those who have been assigned to work in the Municipal Education Bureau and various schools are still paid by the Ministry, but these institutions cannot provide dormitories, and many employees have come with their families, making accommodation an even greater problem, which has not yet been resolved. Those who are waiting in Shanghai are also facing problems with food and accommodation due to transportation difficulties and high prices in other places, and they are carefully considering whether to leave Shanghai. The Ministry of Education staff in Shanghai have organized a liaison association and held their first meeting, beginning registration. They have telegraphed acting Minister Chen in Guangzhou to request instructions regarding the livelihood of their colleagues and their future plans. The Ministry of Education originally planned to set up seven offices in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Fujian, and Jiangxi. Inspector Huang Cengyue has already gone to Fuzhou, and Zhang Zhenchang, assistant to the Director of the General Affairs Department, has gone to Hangzhou. The Shanghai office was originally requested to be presided over by Director Dan Yinsun, but it depends on the formulation of organizational regulations and the determination of funding before matters can proceed easily. It is reported that the Liaison Association is scheduled to hold a meeting today at 1195 Fuxing Middle Road to discuss everything.

### Orphanages Lack Funds for Sustenance: Mayor Promises to Allocate Flour Assistance

[Our Reporter] Due to recent soaring prices and the Civil Affairs Bureau's inability to distribute rice on time, various children's education and care institutions in the city are facing severe economic hardship and are on the verge of collapse. Yesterday morning, representatives Liu Dewei, Zhou Zuwang, Dong Bin, and Zhou Naihao were delegated to meet with Mayor Wu to petition, requesting that rice distribution not be delayed and asking the City Relief Committee to allocate funds to assist each education and care institution with $2,000 per orphaned child. Mayor Wu stated that he would urge the Civil Affairs Bureau to issue rice on time. Regarding financial assistance, he mentioned that the City Relief Committee has limited funds and cannot currently provide it, but he will try to negotiate with American relief organizations to allocate relief flour.

### Mechanized Coal Briquette Industry Requests Allocation of Coal Dust

[Our Reporter] Representatives from the Mechanized Coal Briquette Industry Association petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon, stating that the raw material for coal briquettes, white coal dust, is mostly transported from Hubei to Shanghai. Currently, due to difficulties in Yangtze River shipping, the supply has been disrupted, causing the price of coal briquettes to soar in the city. Industrial workers are also unable to obtain their allocated coal briquettes, and various factories are facing difficulties. They requested government relief. The Social Affairs Bureau informed them that Mayor Wu had decided at a meeting a few days ago that the China Trust Bureau would sell off coal dust. Representatives of the association, upon hearing this, believed that public sales would easily lead to hoarding by large businesses. They hoped that the coal dust would be allocated to members of the industry to produce coal briquettes for sale in the city. The Social Affairs Bureau agreed to forward this opinion to Mayor Wu.

### Two Representatives to Travel to Tianjin to Negotiate Resumption of North China Shipping with the Communists

[Our Reporter] Regarding the shipping industry's "safeguarding of maritime rights" and the resumption of shipping to North China, five senior ship officers' groups in the city have issued a declaration advocating for the immediate dispatch of ships to North China to prevent foreign encroachment on maritime rights. It has been learned that the five groups have appointed Zhou Qixin and Jiang Keni as plenipotentiary representatives, who plan to join shipping company representatives to travel to Tianjin aboard the "Safeguarding Maritime Rights" representative ship within days, in order to negotiate all matters related to the "Resumption of North China Shipping" with the Communist authorities in Pingjin. According to Zhou and Jiang, the ship officers' groups are determined to "rescue maritime rights" and are willing to make any sacrifices to urge the government, the Communists, and shipping companies to achieve unimpeded shipping at all ports nationwide, in order to thwart foreign attempts to seize maritime rights. With the active promotion of the five groups, the government authorities have approved the plan, and shipping companies have designated the "Greater Shanghai" and "Tangshan" as "Safeguarding Maritime Rights" representative ships. They have also received a reply from the Air Force authorities agreeing to provide protection. However, they still hope that the shipping companies will quickly complete customs clearance and other procedures without further delay, as the British Taikoo company's "Hunan" ship has already sailed to outside Tanggu port. If the Communist authorities allow it to enter, the situation will become more difficult. Zhou and Jiang also stated that "Safeguarding Maritime Rights" is not only the responsibility of the shipping industry but also the unanimous demand of all people, and they hope that the press will provide full support.

### Large-Scale Dumping of Goods Commences, Inflation in Commodity Market Slightly Curtailed

[Our Reporter] The policy of large-scale dumping of goods and tightening of credit officially began yesterday after ten days of rampant price increases. The goods to be dumped include five types in total. Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Corporation (CTCC) dumped a total of 500 bales of "Double Earth" 20-count yarn and 394 bales of "Golden Double Horse" yarn, withdrawing approximately 160 million yuan in capital. Taiwan Sugar Corporation also distributed a massive 8,000 bags of Taiwan sugar. The China Trust Bureau and Silk Company were ordered to dump rayon and raw silk. Within one day, a total of 175 boxes of rayon, valued at 56 million yuan, and 1,000 piculs of raw silk, valued at approximately 400 million yuan, were sold. The Coal Adjustment Committee was also ordered to distribute coal, with plans to distribute 17,000 tons of white coal dust within days. In addition to the dumping of these five items, the Central Bank secretly dumped exchange settlement certificates, amounting to approximately 300 million yuan. The market's credit was affected and became tighter than the previous day, with underground interest rates generally rising to 50 yuan per thousand yuan for overnight lending, with a high of 60 yuan. In the afternoon, the situation eased slightly as remittances from other ports arrived. Yesterday, various national banks and bureaus had a net inflow of approximately 170 million yuan. Due to the settlement of funds for the dumping of goods today, credit is expected to be even tighter than yesterday, and general prices are expected to fall. Furthermore, prices in the market yesterday fluctuated greatly. In the morning, within a few hours, gold notes, the black market, and daily necessities all fell by about 20%. The reason for this was partly due to the psychological impact of the dumping of goods, but mainly due to rumors that free trading of gold would be implemented starting today, causing gold note prices to plummet in the black market. By the afternoon, the free trading of gold had not materialized, and funds from other ports arrived, causing prices to rebound again. However, public sentiment remained weak. Based on the actual situation in the market, unless the authorities can provide a large and sustained supply of goods, cyclical inflationary trends may reappear in the short term.

### Rumors of Free Gold and Silver Trading Unconfirmed

[Our Reporter] The rumors of free trading of gold and silver had a significant impact on the market yesterday, but as of yesterday, the Central Bank had not confirmed them. According to relevant sources, there is a high possibility that this will be implemented. The authorities are concerned that after the free market is opened, if the authorities do not control a sufficient amount of spot goods, it may be exploited by speculators and cause a major inflationary trend. Before this new policy is decided, it will be replaced by the dumping of goods.

### Banking Industry to Form a Syndicate to Underwrite Gold Bonds

The Ministry of Finance will soon issue 1949 short-term gold bonds, entrusting the Central Bank to sell them. In addition to designating several regional branches to handle the sales, the bank will also entrust other Chinese and foreign banks to handle them. The amount of sales will be determined by the Ministry of Finance from time to time, taking into account the needs of the national treasury and market conditions, and will be allocated to the Central Bank for distribution. It is understood that the Shanghai banking industry has decided to form a syndicate to prepare for the underwriting of these gold bonds. Furthermore, the lottery for principal repayment of these bonds will be held on the second day of each month, in accordance with the period specified in the amortization schedule for each series of bonds. The lottery will be conducted by the Public Debt Fund Management Committee and supervised by a representative appointed by the Ministry of Finance.

Tight Credit

The market became slightly constrained yesterday due to tight credit, especially for large 100-yuan notes, which were in high demand.

Yesterday, being Monday, the Shanghai market's credit trend was firm but steady. Market demand for funds decreased, but the supply of funds also did not decrease. Turnover was heavy and frequent. Only the supply outside the banks and money shops decreased slightly due to more frequent deposit withdrawals. Interbank lending rates generally rose. At the start of the morning, the highest overnight lending rate was 55 yuan or 60 yuan. However, if cash was used for the lending, it was always done at 60 yuan. The situation intensified near noon, with market transaction lending rates reaching 70 to 75 yuan.

Tung Oil Prices Weaken

Yesterday, the market conditions for tung oil in Shantou also weakened because holders' confidence was undermined. As a result, the closing price of both white and red tung oil was more than 2,000 yuan lower than last week. However, green oil remained stable due to shortages in both existing inventory and incoming shipments.

### Tea Market Asking Prices Rise

[Our Reporter] Although export merchants remained hesitant to purchase export carton tea, domestic colored tea sales continued to be brisk, especially with Yuan Long Tea Firm showing a willingness to accept all orders. However, sellers, feeling that tea stocks were depleted and that prices of other goods outside the industry remained high, did not loosen their selling intentions, and asking prices continued to rise. As a result, the negotiations between buyers and sellers continued to be deadlocked. Red plate trading in the tea market, after many days of mutual rejection, has still not opened.

### Silk Prices Fall

The rayon market yesterday initially rallied but then fell. Prices of goods outside the industry unanimously declined, credit within the industry showed slight signs of tightness, and public sentiment turned weak, causing market prices to decline together. The overnight interest rate for "Bridge 120" opened low at 300,000 yuan. It slightly rose in the middle of the day, but the trend was generally flat. The supply of chips on the market remained abundant, and demand became sluggish. The closing price for overnight interest rate was 330,000 yuan, down 60,000 yuan. Trading was quiet in the afternoon, and the market trend did not improve. Asking prices continued to fall by 20,000 yuan.

Raw silk prices also declined due to the decline in the market price of foreign exchange certificates. The China Trust Bureau also began dumping silk, causing a sharp decline in demand from local merchants and a slight tightening of credit within the industry. Prices of other goods outside the industry also weakened, and sales were sluggish. The initial asking price for high-quality retail lots was 360,000 yuan. After the opening, the atmosphere was dull, and it was difficult for the market trend to improve. Asking prices declined slightly. Near noon, it was heard that the yarn market had stabilized and that the black market for gold notes had rebounded, causing public sentiment to calm down. The market trend then improved again, resulting in a closing price of 370,000 yuan, down 80,000 yuan.

The market trend for silk fabrics also weakened yesterday. At the beginning, due to poor sentiment in various sectors, public sentiment was very weak, and many holders wanted to sell. Afterwards, there was no briskness in the market inside or outside the industry, and the market condition softened. Meya opened with an asking price of 210,000 yuan, and once slightly rebounded, but the trend was still weak. Prices fluctuated at low levels, and the closing price near noon was 205,000 yuan, down 35,000 yuan.

### Although Formal Trading Has Not Resumed, Rice Prices Saw a Slight Decline Yesterday; Authorities Continue Dumping 5,000 Shi

Rice trading has not resumed formal trading within the market due to price controls. The government continued to dump rice, releasing 2,500 shi each in the North and South markets, for a total of 5,000 shi. The price remained unchanged at 4,500 yuan. Due to tighter credit and declines in all goods, the market outside the market also saw a decline. Sellers were eager to sell, and trading became more active. The closing price for white japonica and thin indica rice was 6,500 yuan, down 1,000 yuan from last Saturday; early indica rice was 6,100 yuan, and rough japonica was 5,500 yuan.

Wheat Flour: Affected by tight credit and a sharp drop in gold notes, public sentiment unanimously turned weak. In addition, the decline in rice prices caused the market trend to become unsustainable. The initial asking price for "Old Car" brand flour was 300 yuan lower than last Saturday, opening at 3,100 yuan. Sellers in the Central Market sold off their holdings, and various parties added significantly to their positions, resulting in active trading. Later, buyers added considerable strength, and the market trend rose once again. After the close, many sellers were still eager to sell, causing the market trend to decline again. The closing price for "Old Car" was 2,860 yuan, and "Soldier Ship" and "Red Bee" fell below the 3,000 yuan mark. With a surplus of supply over demand, wheat bran prices fell sharply, with Fuxin trading at 1,780 yuan today.

Grains: All prices fell across the board due to tight credit and urgent demand for funds among holders, leading to large-scale selling. Cowpeas fell sharply by 40%, trading at 5,000 yuan yesterday. Since the government banned exports of shelled peanuts, Guanggang has stopped purchasing them, resulting in a sharp decline in actual sales. Combined with tight credit, the market trend plunged by more than 30%. Maize was being inquired about by the Qing Gang, and the market trend initially declined but then rebounded. There was a sufficient supply of sesame seeds, and red sorghum fell slightly by 10%.

Edible Oil: Yesterday saw the first decline since the red plate market opened. With tighter credit and declines in all goods outside the industry, public sentiment was extremely weak. Factories also sold off their holdings. Soybean oil opened sharply lower at 32,000 yuan, and the Central Market reached a low of 30,000 yuan. The closing price rose slightly to 31,500 yuan. Rapeseed oil closed at 24,500 yuan. Both sharply declined by 9,500 yuan compared to last Saturday. Raw oil fell by 10,000 yuan, and refined raw oil was 35,000 yuan. Soybean cake fell sharply by 1,000 yuan, with more sales than purchases, and there were still no buyers.

### Yarn and Cloth Prices Drop

Yesterday, yarn and cloth prices initially declined but ultimately rose. At the opening, news of declines in financial goods caused holders to feel weak, and more sellers appeared, while buyers hesitated to make purchases. The prices of all yarns initially opened lower. Finally, due to mutual purchases by local merchants and the replication industry, the market sentiment rose together. As a result, all yarns except for 42-count fine yarn saw declines.

42-count Blue Phoenix rose from 350,000 to a high of 410,000, and the closing price retreated to 400,000, reversing a gain of 10,000 compared to Saturday. 32-count Silver Moon initially opened at 250,000, and closed at 295,000 yuan, ultimately falling by 30,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse spot goods jumped directly from 220,000 to 255,000 yuan. However, with buyers turning to a wait-and-see attitude, the trend softened again, resulting in a decrease of 30,000 yuan and a closing price of 245,000 yuan. Factory orders were at 220,000 yuan, with one-day carry trades done at 10,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse initially opened at a low of 190,000 yuan, and finally rebounded to 215,000 yuan, ultimately falling by 25,000 yuan. Prices for 16-count and below mostly declined slightly.

The market trend for cotton cloth weakened because credit in the market was slightly tight, and direct sales to foreign buyers had not started. Retail sales in the Taistreet were also sluggish, and public sentiment temporarily stopped expecting higher prices. Most holders were considering selling their holdings. However, with few buyers, market prices ultimately fell. Dragon Head fine cloth initially opened at 8,800 yuan outside the market, and once rose to 9,400 yuan. At noon, it was heard to be offered at 9,000 yuan, resulting in a decline of approximately 1,500 yuan compared to the weekend. Trumpet Kid fine cloth fell from 7,800 yuan to 7,400 yuan, and there were few inquiries. It rebounded near noon, and finally closed at 7,500 yuan, ultimately falling by 1,300 yuan. Other grades of fine cloth also fell by 1,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge initially opened at 8,200 yuan, and once rose to 8,650 yuan. The trend weakened, and the closing price fell to 7,950 yuan, dropping 1,700 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Straight Gong fell by 2,200 yuan, closing at a weak price of 7,700 yuan.

[Our Reporter] Yesterday, China Textile Construction Corporation (CTCC) dumped goods for the second time on behalf of national banks, releasing two types: 20-count Double Earth and Golden Double Horse, releasing a total of 900 pieces. There were purchase requests for a total of 1,300 pieces. As a result, 894 pieces were approved for purchase, valued at 160,920,000 yuan. The price was 180,000 yuan per piece for both 20-count Double Earth and Golden Double Horse.

Furthermore, the company sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 50 pieces and approving purchases for 24 buyers, valued at 14.8 million yuan. The selling prices for each type of yarn were: 8-count Sunlight, 95,000 yuan; 16-count Red Moon, 180,000 yuan; 32-count Yang He, 250,000 yuan; 40-count Red Jewel Light, 340,000 yuan; 42-count Double-Strand Stand Up Horse, 355,000 yuan; 42-count Double-Strand Mercerized Colored Ball, 400,000 yuan.
