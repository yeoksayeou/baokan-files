### Attempted Landing by Over 100 Communist Boats Repelled at Liu River Estuary; Communication Severed on Zhegan Railway Along Hengfeng, Yiyang, and Yingtan; Communist Troops Flee North from Wangjiangjing North of Jiaxing

[Central News Agency, this city] Military sources released the following war situation at 9:00 PM on the 5th:

(1) A small number of Communist activities were discovered near Xiaoshan this morning. Our defending troops are conducting a strict search and suppression.

(2) More than two thousand bandits on the 4th infiltrated from Leping towards Hengfeng, Yiyang, and Yingtan, disrupting communication by destroying local power lines.

(3) Today at 3:00 AM, over a hundred bandit boats attempted to land at Fanzhai, Liu River Estuary. Upon discovery by our defending troops, they were bombarded with intense artillery fire, sinking over a dozen ships. The remaining vessels retreated northward.

(4) A unit of over one thousand from the 23rd Communist Army, which had infiltrated Wangjiangjing north of Jiaxing, retreated after being intercepted by National troops.

(5) Since being invaded by the bandits, the various counties in southern Anhui have engaged in large-scale plundering. The civilian food supply is almost depleted, with even the last remaining dou of rice being subjected to a 50% levy. Young men are forced into the army, and elderly men are also conscripted to organize stretcher-bearer teams or transport teams, compelled to go to the front lines. Local Communist elements are intensifying their actions, carrying out liquidation struggles. Anyone with even a little knowledge or a small amount of property is labeled a stubborn element or a bourgeois, and becomes the target of liquidation struggles, with no one spared. Good and honest people, unable to bear the bandits' brutal oppression, willingly endure the pain of displacement, with countless numbers fleeing.

[Central News Agency, this city] Military sources reported at 10:00 AM on the 5th:

(1) At 6:00 PM on the 4th, over a thousand bandits, divided into two groups, infiltrated Zhitang and Zhoushu north of Taicang. A strong unit of our defending troops was dispatched to intercept them, resulting in fierce fighting. Over a hundred bandits were killed or wounded, and twelve were captured. The remaining bandits, unable to withstand the assault, fled northwest.

(2) Over a hundred local Communist elements infiltrated Maojiashi north of Taicang on the evening of the 4th, destroying the town's power lines. After a sweep by our defending troops, the bandits fled east towards Ludu.

(3) Tongxiang Chongde, southwest of Jiaxing, was infiltrated by local Communist elements on the evening of the 4th, disrupting communication by destroying the telegraph lines. Our troops are currently searching and suppressing them.

(4) It is reported that Guan Wenwei, the commander of the 10th Communist Army Corps who entered Wuxi, has established a military control committee in Wuxi, with Guan himself serving as the chairman.

### House of Commons Opens Debate; Britain Adopts Non-Intervention Policy on the Situation in China; Conservative Party Suggests Signing a Pacific Pact

[This newspaper's dispatch] London, 5th (broadcast): The debate in the British House of Commons on the situation in China was opened by Minister of Defence Alexander. He stated that the British government adopts a non-intervention policy towards China and does not wish to be drawn into the vortex of the Chinese civil war. However, Conservative Party members demanded that the government take certain measures to curb the expansion of communism in the Far East. Conservative Party member Macmillan suggested signing a Pacific Pact to curb communism. He demanded that the government make it clear that any attack on Hong Kong would be regarded as an act of aggression. Macmillan warned that the Communist authorities in the Kremlin might temporarily suspend their expansionist efforts in the West in order to seek more favorable achievements in the East.

According to Alexander, Britain will send army, navy, and air force reinforcements to Hong Kong to defend against possible Communist attacks. These reinforcements include infantry, tanks, field artillery, anti-aircraft artillery, fighter planes, cruisers, and aircraft carriers. Alexander also revealed that Britain has established a new defense line in the Far East.

[Reuters, London, 5th] When the House of Commons debated the China issue on the 5th, Prime Minister Attlee is expected to issue a warning to the Chinese Communists, stating that Hong Kong is British and that Britain will spare no expense to ensure that it remains British. Attlee will also discuss Britain's policy towards China, even to the extent of describing the nature of the relationship that the British government will establish with the Chinese Communists, stemming from the Amethyst incident. Both London and Washington diplomatic circles are awaiting this statement from the British Prime Minister with great interest. It is generally expected that Attlee will not express radical opinions. However, British government officials have not made a statement regarding their policy in China, and due to the recent rapid changes in the situation in the Far East, domestic and foreign figures have been requesting the British government to make a clear statement as soon as possible. The United States' new policy towards China is also yet to be determined, so Attlee's statement should be given the closest attention. Related sources revealed that since the incident of the British warship being shelled in the Yangtze River, there has been closer contact between the British and American governments regarding the situation in China.

[Reuters, London, 4th] Defence Minister Alexander announced that when the House of Commons debates the situation in China and the incident of the Chinese Communists shelling British warships in the Yangtze River on the 5th, the government will take the opportunity to make a statement on the defense of Hong Kong.

[United Press, London, 4th] Conservative Party leaders are preparing for the debate on the China issue on the 5th of this month, advocating for concerted action with countries in the Far East that have interests and are threatened by the Communist Party. Conservative Party figures stated: "The international Communist Party has won a significant victory in China, and the British government has not fully understood the extent of this victory." In the debate on the 5th, the Conservative Party will argue that "if the entire Far East is not to be trapped, an active policy and concerted action should be taken." According to the Conservative Party's view, security seems to depend on the development of regional defense measures. Countries on the edge of the danger zone may join these measures, including Australia, New Zealand, Malaya, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Siam, Indonesia, Vietnam, India, and Pakistan.

[United Press, London, 4th] Churchill and the Conservative Party prepared on the 4th to launch a fierce attack on the Labour government's Far East policy when the House of Commons debates the situation in China on the 5th. Prime Minister Attlee will preside over this comprehensive debate and will make a statement on behalf of the government, which Churchill will respond to.

Among the list of questions that members of parliament have submitted to the government, the most important is whether Hong Kong can be defended as the Communist army sweeps across China. The government has refused to disclose the strength of the British Far East fleet, but has agreed to answer questions about Hong Kong on the 5th.

After 42 British sailors died in the Yangtze River conflict, public anger demanded an immediate review of the government's Far East policy, and a date for the debate was set. At that time, the government requested that the debate be postponed to the 5th.

Naval parliamentary representative Dugdale has bluntly rejected the Conservative Party's request to list the British warships in the Pacific at the time of the Communist attack on the Amethyst. He also opposed the government's policy of disclosing "defence information." Under repeated questioning, Dugdale admitted that there has been no British aircraft carrier in the Pacific since October 1947. Churchill and his Conservative Party subordinates will attack the government for not having an aircraft carrier in the area when the Amethyst was bombed.

### Abnormal Passenger Traffic on Yuehan Railway; More Returning North Than Going South

[This newspaper, Hankou, 5th] Transportation sector sources: Passenger and freight traffic on the Yuehan Railway is showing an abnormal phenomenon. The number of passengers returning north is more than double the number of passengers going south. The reason is that it is difficult to live in Guangdong and Guangxi, and many refugees are returning after leaving. However, the Chongqing-Hankou shipping remains the same.

### Central Government Discharged Employees Request Change to New Standard for Payment of Fees; Executive Yuan Secretary-General Huang Promises Immediate Discussion

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 5th] The Executive Yuan passed the measures for discharging surplus personnel from various central government agencies on April 16. It stipulated that the discharge fee should be based on the April index (120,000 times), paid for three months' salary, public expenses, and in-kind compensation, and stipulated that all payments should be cleared before April 30 so that all discharged employees could return to their hometowns as soon as possible. The payments have been delayed until now, and some have not been paid in full, and some have not been paid at all. Calculated at the currency value at that time (April 30), the total discharge fee could be about 100 silver dollars. Now that the authorities have issued large banknotes and state-owned enterprises are charging in silver dollars, causing the gold yuan to depreciate sharply, the discharge fee that the discharged personnel, who are at a loss, should receive is only a few silver dollars at the current market price, which is not enough to cover the cost of the journey home. If used to support a family of several people, it would only be enough for three or four days of food in today's Guangzhou. Therefore, the discharged employees gathered in the afternoon of the 5th to discuss the matter. It was resolved to submit a request to the Executive Yuan to pay the discharge fee in accordance with the method of paying public employees' salaries at the market value of Customs Gold Units passed on the 4th of this month. Representatives of the Social Affairs Department, the News Bureau, the Police Department, the Population Bureau, and the Labor Bureau, Ding Wenan, Luo Luohou, Yang Liezu, Xu Kehuang, and Zhou Wenyuan, went to the Executive Yuan to visit Secretary-General Huang Shaogu, and presented the document.

### The Peculiar Phenomenon of Housing Shortages in Paris

— Xi Lan

[Paris, 27th Dispatch] In Paris, a salaried worker pays only one franc per month for rent, enough for a family of six to live in. A moderate apartment with three or four rooms costs only two francs per month (equal to ten packs of the cheapest cigarettes). The usual rent ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 francs per month. High-ranking officials or important figures pay only 3.5 to 8 or 10 francs per month.

This situation seems excellent, but there is a very bad side to it because houses are never vacant, no one moves out, and landlords cannot evict tenants. Newly married couples cannot find houses to live in, so they must live with their parents or their wife's family. In Paris, virtually no new houses have been built in the past twelve years.

The only opportunity to get a house is when people die.

When someone dies, you can try to rent the deceased person's room. Therefore, behind a frail and declining old man basking in the park's sunshine, there is a young wife discussing with his landlord about taking over his room. Others deal with funeral homes to make connections.

There are two ways to rent an apartment after someone dies. One legal way is: if you can meet certain preferential conditions, you can get a chance to requisition it, but often several people can meet these conditions, so this route often doesn't work. The other way is illegal but the most reliable: negotiate with the deceased's heir, and immediately move some furniture in after the person dies. Once you step into that house, you are a god.

To find an apartment, it costs about 500 to 1,500 francs a month. Therefore, salaried workers should abandon the idea of living in large houses; they can only live with their families in dilapidated hotels.

There are about 84,000 houses in Paris, almost 90% of which were built before World War I. Even officials estimate that 16,000 are dilapidated and need to be demolished. The rest are not necessarily satisfactory. 82% of Parisian houses have no bathrooms, and more than half of the people have to go outside to use the toilet. Only slightly more than one in six houses even have running water and are considered complete by government inspectors.

Most landlords don't have the money to maintain their properties, let alone improve them. Here's an example: a woman owns three houses with a total of 34 rooms, all rented to middle-class families. After paying taxes and repair costs, her rental income not only has no surplus, but she loses 80 francs a year. Her son has to support her and take out 80 francs to pay her taxes, but she cannot sell the houses because no one wants to buy them.

If you want to stop repairs and recover some money, that's impossible. An owner once failed to repair his property on time, causing rain to damage some of his tenant's armchairs. He was sued and had to pay compensation and a fine. Rents in Paris have increased sixfold since 1914, but taxes have increased 13.2 times, and repair costs have increased 120 to 150 times from their 1914 value.

The French Parliament has spent much time trying to solve this complex problem. In fact, since the liberation, the law allows landlords to increase rents, but retail prices have risen much more. Simply put, rents for new houses (built after 1914) are allowed to increase only tenfold compared to before World War II, while rents for old houses (nine out of ten houses are old) are allowed to increase by 12% compared to 1939, or 7% compared to 1914.

If a new building were built today, the landlord would probably charge ten to thirteen times the current rental value to break even. Therefore, according to a report by the French Economic Bureau, the current rental value for a house with three rooms and a kitchen for a salaried worker is 13 to 16 francs a year, which would increase to 166 to 200 francs a year in the future. A French observer said: Even so, no one would want to build new houses.

### Chennault's Speech at the U.S. National Press Club: America Has Only Three Paths to Follow Regarding China: Indifference, Appeasement of the Communists, or Immediate Aid

[United Press, Washington, 4th] General Chennault told reporters and government officials on the 4th that the time for America to make a decision on China is now, or it will be too late.

Today, 750 people crowded into the spacious room of the National Press Club to listen to Chennault's speech, almost breaking a record. Chen said that America has only three paths to follow regarding China: (1) Indifference, (2) Appeasement of the Communists, (3) Immediate Aid.

Chen reiterated his remarks to the Senate Military Affairs Committee yesterday, describing the vastness of southwestern China, saying that if given aid, China could hold the southwest to resist the Communists. However, after delivering his prepared remarks, Chen suggested in response to questions: (1) Provide direct military and economic aid to the Nationalist government, but with direct American supervision over the use of this aid at the upper levels of the Chinese government. He made a similar suggestion last year regarding the $125 million military aid program, but the supervision clause was ignored at that time. (2) The United States should assure the Nationalist government of moral support so that they can "organize and fight under one banner." (3) If the United States remains indifferent or engages in appeasement, it will only result in the Communists conquering all of China and eventually conquering all of Asia.

Previous Military Aid Failed to Arrive in Time Chen explicitly denied that China had received $2 billion in usable American aid, and stated that no part of the military aid under the $125 million program fell into the hands of the Communists. One reason was that the military aid did not arrive in China in time. If the Communists seized any military aid, it must have been "seized in the Pacific or in San Francisco because military aid never arrived in Shanghai before the fall of Xuzhou." (Note: It was previously reported that American military equipment shipped to China was diverted to Taiwan.)

When asked if he knew the contents of General Wedemeyer's long secret report, Chen replied that he did not, but secretly suspected that the report recommended aid to China.

Chen strongly praised Wedemeyer, saying that Wedemeyer's actions while commanding the U.S. China Theater were exactly what was needed. Chen twice caused laughter in the audience. He said that he "had to consult with a lawyer" before answering whether he had obtained the approval of the War Department before publishing his recent book, "Way of a Fighter," and the audience laughed. When asked if his remarks today had been approved by the Secretary of Defense before being delivered, Chen gave the same answer, and the audience laughed again. (Note: Secretary of Defense Johnson recently ordered that speeches or writings by retired military officers must be reviewed by the War Department before publication.)

Very Few Usable Surplus Materials Remain in the Pacific

When asked whether China had received $2 billion in aid since the Japanese surrender, as reported by the State Department, Chen replied that China had never received any aid that they could use. The American side estimated the value at $860 million, but most of the surplus property that the Chinese side tried to obtain from the Pacific islands was unusable and much of it was resold to the United States as scrap metal. Of the military equipment given to China by the United States, very little was usable by China. China had to buy Mosquito bombers from Canada because they could not obtain the necessary aircraft from the United States. Furthermore, China could not obtain spare parts or .50 caliber machine gun bullets for the aircraft they already had. Before the Pearl Harbor incident, the United States sold scrap metal and oil to Japan while giving China moral support, which still helped China fight. Today, this kind of moral support would be most effective.

When asked why, if President Chiang and the Kuomintang members were ineffective, not try new leaders, Chen replied: "If new leaders can be found, this may be a good idea. However, China has tried to find a new leader and failed. As far as he knows, the United States has no secret agreement to assist the Communists.

Hundreds of Millions of People in Government-Controlled Areas Are Willing to Fight the Communists

Chen repeatedly emphasized that hundreds of millions of people in non-Communist-controlled China are prepared, able, and willing to fight the Communists. Muslims in the Northwest have vowed to fight the Communists to the death and have repeatedly defeated the Communist army. The garrison in China's "Pittsburgh"—Taiyuan—has demonstrated a good example of the Chinese people's fighting spirit. Taiyuan was besieged for months, subjected to intense bombardment for ten days, its fortifications were completely destroyed, and the entire garrison was wiped out before it fell. They fought extremely bravely because they had been shareholders in the province's enterprises for many years.

When asked to estimate China's needs for fighting, Chen replied that General Stilwell had estimated that 2,000 tons of small arms ammunition could equip a Chinese division for six months of combat.

Chen believes that the possibility of America doing business with the Communists is very small, saying that the Communists will allow the United States to sell certain urgently needed goods, but under strict control, until the Communists can obtain these goods elsewhere, at which point they will no longer allow the United States to sell them.

Acheson Told Reporters that the State Department's Attitude Remains Unchanged

Meanwhile, Secretary of State Acheson told reporters that the State Department's attitude remained unchanged—that continuing aid would be a waste.

Senators Mundt and Nolan said they were preparing an amendment to revise the Arms Act to provide aid to China.

Acheson declined to comment on Chennault's remarks yesterday.

Nolan had recently requested that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee investigate the US government's "delayed" China policy, but Committee Chairman Connally said that European problems came first, "Besides, we have heard a lot about China." Nolan said that the committee had taken no action on his request, so he had to try to include China in the Arms Act. To obtain all relevant information on the situation in China, he had requested that the Senate Military Affairs Committee invite General Wedemeyer to testify before the committee after Chennault.

### Editorial: Value Production Enterprises!

In a turbulent situation, production enterprises are hit first and suffer the most. This situation is felt more deeply and severely in this city! Because the production enterprises in this city are dependent in nature, raw materials and fuel must rely on other production areas, and the sales of products must also rely on other markets. When transportation is inconvenient, the impact is significant. Recently, since the Communist army moved south, transportation to and from this city has been almost completely cut off, resulting in the disruption of supplies, the stagnation of product sales, and the paralysis of the entire production sector.

In recent years, various regions have suffered the destruction of war, and people's purchasing power has weakened to the extreme, which is an unexpected blow to the outlet of industrial products. Now that the flames of war directly threaten Shanghai, if Shanghai becomes a battlefield, it will not only be impossible to engage in reproduction, but even the little remaining industrial equipment may not escape ruthless destruction. A few days ago, the Chinese Institute of Engineers issued an urgent appeal, asking the authorities to protect production equipment and not allow the surviving production equipment to be swallowed up by military forces again, to leave a bit of vitality for the country and the nation, and to leave a glimmer of hope for the production sector on which people's livelihoods depend. These words are full of blood and tears, how sad and how earnest! For the sake of our descendants for thousands of years, we must also cherish and protect this only production industry in the country.

In the past, our main production enterprises were mostly in the hands of foreign merchants with strong financial resources, and the domestic production industry was根本unable to compete with them, resulting in a colonial economic state. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, when foreigners' special rights in China were cancelled, far-sighted and enthusiastic national industrialists devoted themselves to the construction of the production industry. Unexpectedly, the civil war followed, making it impossible for the production industry to raise its head, especially the heavy taxes, which made the production industry unbearable. The phrase "虚盈实税" (virtual profit, real tax) has exhausted the pain suffered by the production industry in paying taxes. However, although the environment at that time was quite恶劣, the production industry could still struggle hard, such as developing Nanyang trade, implementing north-south material exchanges, and other methods to enable the production industry to barely survive to this day, but now even these small roads have been blocked off, and the future of the production industry, even if it is not destroyed by砲火, I am afraid it will be suffocated to death.

Another major difficulty of the production industry is the problem of raising funds. As is well known, industrial funds require long-term funds, but under the current situation, the value of currency changes daily, and floating funds are mostly entrusted to underground money houses, becoming the capital of speculators who buy and sell short. Who is willing to provide long-term loans? And even if factories can barely borrow money, the heavy burden of interest is not something that factories engaged in production can afford. Even if there are, they are only a kind of behavior in which the production industry drinks poison to quench its thirst when its capital turnover is not灵敏. In the past, the production industry also relied on low-interest loans from national banks to maintain its operations, but since the situation became tense, this kind of loan has disappeared, virtually cutting off another lifeline of the production industry. When the Central Bank's Executive Committee held a meeting on the 2nd of this month, it was reported that the bank authorities had discussed the issue of emergency loans for production enterprises. Emergency loans, although in the form of short-term funds, are still much better than the high-interest loans borrowed from地下钱庄s. It is hoped that the authorities will make a decision as soon as possible to avoid the long-term僵化of production specialization.

The wage problem is also a headache for the current production industry. Now, despite the fact that products cannot be sold and raw materials cannot be replenished, wages still have to be prepared every time朔望 comes; moreover, not only do we have to get到头寸, but we also have to忙cash, 忙bank notes, and 忙silver dollars. When忙cash, 忙silver dollars, we have to first张罗to the Central Bank's bank notes不可. Even if all the money is prepared, the labor side will still be dissatisfied with the calculation of the cost of living index, which makes the entrepreneurs who run factories extremely discouraged; therefore, the phenomenon of停工减产is everywhere. Sometimes funds cannot be raised; if the labor and management have a harmonious relationship and the labor side sympathizes with the capital side's situation, the payment of wages can be delayed for a few days, or finished products can be used as抵; otherwise, the huge wave of labor unrest, or the停歇of factories, is不可避免. Furthermore,停歇of factories is not a simple matter. Sufficient severance pay and reasons for停歇must be prepared first in order to respond to all parties' accusations.

There is no doubt that industry is the lifeblood of the country. Today, the production industry is already facing a绝境of recession and extreme不安. To revive the nation, we must cherish this lifeblood. This city has always been the industrial center of the country. The prosperity or decline of this city is related to the prosperity or decline of the economy. It is up to the authorities to vigorously support the production industry. Moreover, among the six million people in this city, there are indeed quite a few who are directly or indirectly attached to industrial生存; and industry is the source of tax revenue, and its impact on the national treasury should not be ignored.

### The Four-Power Agreement is Officially Announced: The Date for Lifting the Berlin Blockade and Convening the Foreign Ministers' Conference is Confirmed: British and American Airlifts Will Continue Until the Situation is Clarified

[United Press, Berlin, 5th] Officials announced today that the four countries of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have reached an agreement. According to the agreement, the Soviet Union will lift the Berlin blockade on the 12th of this month, and the retaliatory blockade of the Soviet military occupation zone in Germany by the United States, Britain, and France will also end at the same time. The foreign ministers of the four countries will meet in Paris on the 23rd of this month to discuss various issues related to Germany, including the Berlin currency issue. The four-power agreement is the result of two months of tense negotiations. The agreement was announced simultaneously in Washington, Paris, London, Moscow, and New York, where the negotiations were held. The full text is as follows:

(1) All traffic, transportation, and trade restrictions imposed by the Soviet government since March 1, 1948, between Berlin and West Germany and between East Germany and West Germany shall be lifted on May 12, 1949. (2) All traffic, transportation, and trade restrictions imposed by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, or any one of them, since March 1, 1948, between Berlin and East Germany and between West Germany and East Germany shall also be lifted on May 12, 1949. (3) Eleven days after the restrictions mentioned in Articles 1 and 2 are lifted, namely May 23, 1949, a meeting of the foreign ministers of the four countries shall be convened in Paris to consider various issues related to Germany and various issues caused by the Berlin situation, including the Berlin currency issue. A copy of the agreement was handed over to UN Secretary-General Lie at the time of publication, along with a letter from the United States, Britain, and France requesting that this matter be communicated to the UN Security Council.

[This Newspaper] London, 5th Broadcast: Bevin said in the House of Commons after announcing the four-power公报on the Berlin issue that Western countries' airlifts will continue until the Berlin situation is completely clarified, and said that he will go to Berlin on the weekend to老察the airlift situation. Bevin continued, that the British government welcomes this agreement, and the spirit of柏林residents'坚苦卓绝has really helped it. This agreement proves that the policy we have adopted is正当reasonable and has now收获good results. The British government will participate in the new Foreign Ministers' Conference with the same坚忍spirit, hoping to find the basis for a permanent solution to the German problem at future meetings.

[This Newspaper] New York, 5th Broadcast: Lake Success News, UN diplomats welcomed the news of the solution to the粕林problem. Chiang Ting-fu, the Chinese representative to the United Nations, said that the conditions for this solution are very similar to the recommendations made by the previous neutral country committee, which is gratifying.

[United Press, Berlin, 5th] People close to the Soviet military government said that the first step the Soviet Union will take in lifting the Berlin blockade will be to demand a referendum to promote the establishment of a German central government. According to observers, virtually every German will support a unified Germany. Through a referendum, the Soviet Union hopes to prevent the establishment of West Germany and gain a say in the control of the Ruhr industrial area. This statement was strengthened by the German Communist 公报. The公报called on all Germans to demand the establishment of a central government in the four occupation zones, the conclusion of a peace treaty, and the withdrawal of all occupying forces. It is also reported that railway officials in the Soviet zone have been ordered to be on duty all day to理妥the railways and trains in preparation for "大量" freight transport.

### The Cold War between East and West Reveals Warm Sunshine: All Europeans Are Rejoicing: Peaceful Cooperation Depends on Future Efforts

[Reuters, London, 5th] The joy in the capitals of European countries upon hearing the news that the Berlin blockade would be lifted was no less than when the end of World War II was learned in 1945. London diplomatic circles believe that this news indicates that the Eastern and Western powers are making real efforts to restore a peaceful atmosphere in Europe and have brought the most dangerous stage of the Cold War to an end.

After announcing the 公报, the Berlin radio station controlled by the Soviet Union also made a five-minute short commentary, pointing out that the two sides finally reached a compromise spirit to deal with the Berlin problem, which is the most hopeful event in three years. The major newspapers in London, Paris, and Washington all刊载this important news in the most prominent position. Most British newspapers believe that the Soviet Union's agreement to lift the Berlin blockade should never be regarded as a conspiracy. A spokesman for the U.S. State Department said that if the Soviet Union could adopt the same willing attitude of cooperation when the Foreign Ministers' Conference is convened, the German problem would not be difficult to solve.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th] Members of the US Congress expressed optimism about the four countries' agreement to lift the blockade of拍林, but took a slightly conservative attitude. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally said that this agreement is "clear evidence of progress on the road to international cooperation, and I hope that the German problem can be resolved in the end." Democratic Senator Tydings said, "This is good news, at least a good start." Senator McMahon pointed out that lifting the blockade would relieve the United States of an economic burden, but said, "The results of the four foreign ministers' meetings are even more important than this. We must wait for the results of this meeting before we can express our joy."

### British and American Newspaper Commentary

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 5th] The "New York Times" commented today on the four-country agreement to lift the Berlin blockade, saying, "The cessation of the Berlin blockade does not mean that the war of nerves has ceased. The current situation in China makes people wonder who is winning this war." The editorial continued, "The lifting of the blockade undoubtedly proves the success of the Western countries in Berlin and throughout Western Europe. This success shows that although the Soviet Union arbitrarily obstructs the weak, it takes a循循attitude when faced with the will to resist resolutely. Credit for this victory should be given to the politicians of the Western countries who创设and smoothly implemented the Marshall Plan, the unity of Western Europe, the Atlantic Treaty, and countless men and women in France and Italy who resisted the progress of the Communist Party, and General Clay, the commander-in-chief of the U.S. Army in Germany, insisted on carrying out airlift work to avoid unfortunate events, which is also an important功臣."

[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] London newspapers unanimously expressed satisfaction with the four powers' agreement to lift the Berlin blockade. However, the wording of their editorials was quite cautious, all saying that lifting the blockade was only the first step, and the Soviet Union's sincerity must be proved at the future four-power foreign ministers' meeting.

### Clay's Farewell Address

[United Press, Grafenwöhr, Germany, 4th] Outgoing U.S. Military Governor of Germany Clay bid farewell to his soldiers today. 11,000 American troops participated in the farewell ceremony. Clay, on the review stand, seemed quite疲惫. He gave a five-minute speech in a tone full of emotion, his voice哽咽. After the speech, 17 cannon salutes were fired to pay tribute. The troops participating in the review included 255 tanks. 36 American generals who had rushed over from other parts of Europe were also on the review stand, standing beside Clay. Then, Lieutenant General Huebner, the successor to the military governor of Germany, read out the White House's statement accepting Clay's resignation, and the ceremony concluded.

[Reuters, Washington, 4th] Related sources revealed that President Truman and Secretary of State Acheson are doing their best to persuade International Bank for Reconstruction and Development President McCloy to promise to serve as the first U.S. High Commissioner to Germany.

### The Soviet Commander in Austria Changes

[Reuters, Vienna, 4th] General Kurasov, who has served as the Soviet commander-in-chief in Austria since the end of the war, will soon leave Austria to take up an important position. Today, he visited the commanders-in-chief of the other major occupying forces to bid farewell. TASS said that the successor to the Soviet commander-in-chief in Austria is Lieutenant General Sviridov, the former commander-in-chief in Hungary.

### Britain Has No Aircraft Carriers in the Pacific Region

Navy Undersecretary Announces to Parliament

[Reuters, London, 4th] The British Admiralty declined to answer a parliamentary question regarding the deployment of British naval forces in the Pacific region. Conservative MP Mr. Carpenter, in the House of Commons, requested the government to provide figures for all classes of British warships in the Pacific region as of April 20, 1949, and to compare them with figures from January 1, 1947. Navy Undersecretary Mr. Dugdale refused to provide the information, stating that its publication would be inconsistent with government policy. However, he told another Conservative MP that since October 1947, there have been no British aircraft carriers in the Pacific region.

### Britain and the United States are Testing Automatically Controlled Rockets

"Reuters, Nassau, Bahamas, 5th" A government spokesperson has confirmed reports from the United States that negotiations are underway between London and Washington to test automatically controlled rockets in the Bahamas. The spokesperson said that the rockets will be controlled by a radio station 120 miles away. The rockets will not be loaded with explosives but will only contain guidance detonators which can be used via radio to self-destruct the rocket if it veers off course.

### The Berlin Airlift Creates Special Merits; Clay Retires with Accomplishment and Deserves Praise; the US and UK Spend Vast Sums, 47 Pilots Die.

[United Press, Berlin, 4th] The American and British airlift to Berlin has achieved a great victory today, with the Soviet Union agreeing to lift the land blockade of Berlin, thus achieving the will of those determined. The airlift initially began as a small-scale contingency plan, but within ten months, it became a great feat. Twenty-five American pilots and twenty-two British pilots died while airlifting food and coal to Berlin. The United States spent a total of $150 million on transport, and Britain spent tens of millions of pounds.

Today, airlift planes are still operating as usual, and the pilots hardly pay attention to the New York negotiations to lift the blockade. Starting next week, these people can probably reduce their strange adventures and entrust most of the freight to railways and trucks, but the political effect of the airlift will last a long time. Some people believe that communism has been blocked at the Spree River (which runs through Berlin's urban area). The Soviet side never thought that the United States and Britain could supply a city solely by air, and the Soviet Union forced the United States and Britain to build and train what can be called the largest air force in peacetime history. Not only did the Soviet Union doubt the success of the airlift, but also some authorities in the United States and Britain did, but only one person believed from the beginning that it would succeed, namely General Clay, the commander of the US forces in Germany who initiated the airlift. Clay has retired with success tomorrow. The airlift began on a Sunday afternoon in June last year when the Soviet Union blockaded the land and water traffic in West Berlin and announced that it would no longer supply the citizens of West Berlin. Clay immediately summoned the air force stationed in Wiesbaden and summoned the chief of staff. Clay proposed airlifting food to Berlin. The chief of staff readily agreed to transport 60 tons, but Clay wanted to transport 500 tons, which made the chief of staff dumbfounded. At that time, there were only twin-engine light transport aircraft teams in Germany, but they still tried it resolutely. Hours later, battle-scarred C47 transport planes departed from the airport to Berlin, without stopping in the cold and heat, and continued to work hard until today.

### South Korea's Northern Part of Kaesong City is Suddenly Attacked by North Korean Troops

The Army Department Announces It Has Repelled Them

[United Press, Seoul, 5th] The South Korean Army Department announced on the 5th that two groups of North Korean troops carrying Japanese artillery and machine guns crossed the 38th parallel in the U.S. sector on the 4th and attacked the northern part of Kaesong City (transliteration), which is 50 miles northwest of Seoul, but were all repelled by the South Korean troops. It is said that the first batch of about 200 North Korean troops launched an attack from the Soviet-controlled area and were repelled by two battalions of South Korean troops. The second time, another 300 North Korean troops, later reinforced by 500 troops, attacked the same area and were also repelled. One South Korean soldier died and twelve were injured. The initial purpose of the North Korean troops' attack is unclear. It is generally believed that the possible purpose of the North Korean troops is to seize the mountain overlooking Kaesong City. The mountain is located on the 38th parallel separating North and South Korea. This war ended at 6:30 pm on the 4th, and the South Korean troops "completely controlled the situation."

### Negotiations between the Netherlands and Indonesia Are Approaching the End Stage

Deeply Believed That There Are Still Hidden Reefs in the Future

[Reuters, Batavia, 4th] The informal negotiations between the Netherlands and the Republic of Indonesia, chaired by the United Nations, which are being conducted here, will reach the end stage this week. The chief representative of the Netherlands, Mr. Van Royen, and the chief representative of Indonesia, Mr. Rom, have been working hard for two weeks to reach an agreement on the following points: (1) the degree of sovereignty that the Republic of Indonesia can exercise; (2) the Netherlands' requirement that the Republic of Indonesia accept the armistice; (3) the date and conditions for convening a round table conference in The Hague. Mr. Nasir, one of the representatives of the Indonesian delegation, resigned from his position as a representative today. It is said that it is an expression of the division of opinions within the Indonesian delegation. Therefore, some people believe that there may still be hidden reefs in the future of the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations.

### US Military Supplies Allocated to the Netherlands Will Be Used to Deal with Indonesia

The Indonesian Representative in the United States Mainly Prevents This

[United Press, New York, 5th] The representative of the Republic of Indonesia in the United States, Mr. Sumitro, announced today that the military equipment allocated to the Netherlands under the North Atlantic Treaty can be used by the Netherlands to deal with Indonesia, just as it uses funds assisted by the Economic Cooperation Administration to carry out colonial wars. Although the use of American military supplies delivered to the Netherlands in the future can be strictly controlled, those already in the hands of the Dutch army will not be controlled, and the Dutch reinforcements recently sent to Indonesia are by no means unarmed. The US government had previously stated that the military supplies that the United States supplies to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries will only be used for their own national defense. If the Netherlands and France do so, they cannot use this to transfer it to Indonesia and Vietnam. If there is a violation of this condition, the United States has the right to stop lending military supplies. In order to strengthen this policy, the State Department is seriously considering adding a clause to the military supply contract, stipulating that American military supplies cannot be used to free up its own national military supplies and transfer them elsewhere.

### Belgian House of Representatives Approves the Convention

[United Press, Brussels, 4th] The Belgian House of Representatives today approved the North Atlantic Treaty by a vote of 139 to 22. The treaty still needs to be approved by the Senate.

Australia, India, Pakistan, New Zealand, etc. all agree to support Myanmar.

[Reuters, Bern, 4th] Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Swiss Foreign Minister Petitpierre will exchange the instruments of ratification of the Treaty of Friendship between the two countries here on the 5th. The treaty contains nine articles and was signed in New Delhi on August 14 last year. It is the first treaty signed by India with a foreign country after its independence. After the exchange of documents, the treaty will take effect.

### Dulles Attends Senate Testimony and Supports the Atlantic Treaty, Emphasizing the Importance of Pacific Defense

[United Press, Washington, 5th] Republican figure Dulles said to the Senate Military Committee today that war is very possible if the United States does not ratify the North Atlantic Treaty. Mr. Dulles indirectly hinted that the defense of the Pacific is as important as the Atlantic. It is said that Stalin announced 25 years ago that the victory of the revolution depends on the revolution of colonies and dependent countries. Stalin specifically mentioned China and India, saying that this kind of statement is still the main part of the Soviet Communist Party's bible, and we should not forget it for a day.

### The French Trial of French Traitors Is Coming to an End

Special Court Will Be Abolished Next Month

[Reuters, Paris, 5th] The French handling of French traitors after the war has almost come to an end today. The National Assembly is already discussing a bill stipulating that all special courts established after the liberation to try French traitors will be abolished from June 1, and only the higher court specializing in the trial of former Vichy government cabinet members and senior officials will continue to be preserved. By 1948, the Higher Court had tried a total of 57 criminals, including 16 tried in absentia. Among them, 18 were sentenced to death, including 10 who were sentenced to death in absentia. Those executed were Vichy Prime Minister Laval, Secret Police Chief Darnand, Vichy Representative to the occupied areas Brinon. The death sentences of Marshal Petain and Navy Commander-in-Chief Laborde were commuted to life imprisonment. The death sentences of State Councilor Messing and Minister of Justice Tallace were commuted to life imprisonment. Vichy Commander in Syria, Denz, died in prison.

### "I Chose Freedom" Will Be Brought to the Screen

The Original Author Kravchenko Announces

[Reuters, London, 5th] Kravchenko, the author of "I Chose Freedom," told reporters here today that he intends to put the content of the book on the screen as a crisp, sincere, and humane script without any propaganda effect. In other words, it is sympathetic to Russia and opposed to the Soviets. Mr. Kravchenko also said that he intends to adapt the book into a radio script. He still intends to complete another book and then return to his hometown. He particularly emphasized the point of returning to his country. Although it is unknown when this matter can be realized, his life has no meaning if it is not realized one day. Mr. Kravchenko solemnly denied that he is related to any right-wing or reactionary groups. He quite approves of the British socialist government. When talking about the Cold War between the East and the West, he believes that it is not optimistic, because the compromise on the Berlin issue is just pouring a drop of cold water on the burning flame, and there will be more amazing events in the future.

### Ingrid Bergman Decides to Divorce Her Husband

The Two Could Not Help But Shed Tears When They Kissed Goodbye

[Reuters, Palermo, Sicily, 4th] Hollywood Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman and her husband, Dr. Lindström, could not help but shed tears when they kissed goodbye here today. Italian director Rossellini, who is known as Ingrid's new lover, and many photographers were present to witness this moving scene. Ingrid and the other three had a negotiation with a lawyer last night at the Royal Hotel in Messina, Sicily. This morning, Ingrid and her husband kissed goodbye in tears in front of the hotel. Lindström, the director of surgery at the Los Angeles Hospital, is a famous brain specialist. After learning that Ingrid intended to marry Rossellini, he rushed over from Los Angeles. After saying goodbye to her husband, Ingrid took a boat with Rossellini to the island of Stromboli to continue filming. Dr. Lin took a plane back to the United States. There are different rumors about the results of the negotiations in the hotel last night. Some say that Ingrid has reached a compromise with her husband, and others say that Ingrid and Lindström have decided to divorce. However, according to film industry sources here, Hollywood film tycoon Hughes, who is also the main investor in the film Ingrid is currently filming in Italy, has decided to stop sponsoring the film because he is dissatisfied with Ingrid's love affair with Rossellini. Film industry sources also pointed out that the film was originally sponsored by Hollywood film tycoon MGM boss Goldwyn, but Mr. Goldwyn decided to withdraw his sponsorship after meeting with Rossellini.

### The British Labour Party

— By Brailsford, Translated by Song Guihuang

During the First World War, the Independent Labour Party attracted many liberals from the left wing because of its opposition to imperialism. Now that it had these new forces! Therefore, its appearance contained the tradition of liberalism, that is, humanitarianism, willingness to accept the opinions of the other party, especially in international or imperial disputes. Later, when the Liberal Party frequently disintegrated due to the divisions between Asquith and Lloyd George, the more progressive liberals flocked to the Labour Party. One of the results was that Henderson saw that the constitution of the Labour Party must be revised. Until 1918, middle-class members who wanted to join the Labour Party still needed to obtain the qualifications of members of the Independent Labour Party or the Fabians first. As a result, the Independent Labour Party was responsible for publicity and campaigning. But in this year, in each constituency, there was always a party branch coexisting with the trade union branch. Equally important was that both manual workers and brain workers could join the party without discrimination. Today, the political organization of the Labour Party has expanded its foundation from this, and it is fortunate that the Independent Labour Party withdrew from it by 1932.

National Organization

In these early formative periods, the Labour Party evolved from a small group whose original goal was to promote the special interests of manual workers, so as to unite them into a political party, hoping to participate in politics on a national scale. Today, most of the members and voters of the Labour Party are still manual workers, and most of its funds are collected from members. Every annual meeting can always call on the majority of members. But the whole situation is more than that. Political organizations and education work are entrusted to the party branches under the jurisdiction of the electoral districts, and the middle class is quite powerful in these party branches. These party branches lead a kind of traditional social life and service that the Independent Labour Party had in its early days. These are not available in other political parties. It contains the style of believers who oppose the state religion, and its Sunday evening meetings contain the atmosphere of religion and politics.

In the close comradeship of the Labour Party, class differences soon faded. A hundred years ago, Marx said that the proletariat had nothing to lose but their chains, but the proletariat had disappeared in the British Isles. Today, the proletariat are all dark-skinned, but you must go to Africa and India to find them. For six or seventy years, manual workers have relied on the assistance of Ruskin College to carry out self-education in order to bear their responsibilities. As a result, in the main objects of the labor movement in the past half century, the level of ability has gradually increased, occupying the first seat in Parliament. Although it is in the idealism of the next generation, there are many scientists, poets, technicians and doctors. Today, it speaks for half the people in the country. The backgrounds of its members in the House of Commons are the most complicated. In the front row seats, Bevan, Bevin and Shinwell are all from manual workers; Morrison is a store employee, Alexander is from the cooperative movement, and Attlee, Dalton, and Bagg are lecturers at the London School of Economics, and Cripps is a famous lawyer. (To be continued)

### European Charter Completed and Signed; the Ideal of a Unified Europe is Gradually Becoming a Reality; Whether to Allow Greece and Turkey to Participate Is Still Awaiting Final Decision

[Reuters, London, 5th] Ten European countries today signed the charter of the European Parliament here, making the dream of a unified Europe, which has lasted for centuries, one step closer to reality. In St. James's Palace in London, under the flickering candlelight, European leaders and politicians signed this historic European Charter one by one. British Foreign Minister Bevin said in his speech at the signing that Europe's interest in the European Parliament is no less than that of the Atlantic Treaty, which is the most important step towards the desire for a unified Europe. The content of the charter is expected to be announced tonight, which stipulates that the headquarters of the European Parliament will be located in Strasbourg, France, and clearly states that the European Parliament is consultative in nature, and its task is based on the principle of not hindering the United Nations Charter. Regarding whether Greece and Turkey can participate in the European Parliament, a final decision will be made by the ten foreign ministers. The Belgian Ambassador to Britain signed on behalf of Foreign Minister Spaak.

### Mayor's Cup Women's Round Robin Finals; Green Team and Li Team Win One After Another; Men's Elimination Round Robin Tournament; Tung Wah Narrowly Eliminates Putien; Tonight, John and Min Li Compete for the Women's Elimination Championship

Two matches of the Mayor's Cup Basketball Women's Round Robin Finals and a match of the Men's Elimination Round Robin Tournament were held in the gymnasium from 5 pm yesterday. There were thousands of spectators, and the situation was not lonely. In the first match of the women's group, the Li team played against the Eagle team. Referee Wu Xiaodi and Wu Zibin, Chen Wentan and Qian Chuping scored the first record for the Li team. Eagle team Huang Pinzhen broke the net twice for equality. The first quarter ended with a draw of 5 to 5. At the beginning of the second quarter, the competition was still fierce, creating equals. The Eagle team made a big mistake by replacing Huang Pinzhen with Lu Jinhua. The Li team took the opportunity to rise, and ended the first half with 17 to 13. After the break, the battle became a stalemate. When it was 20 to 25, the Eagle team Wang Canhua was dismissed for five fouls. Soon, the third quarter ended, with the Eagle team at 21 and the Li team at 25. In the last quarter, Chuping built on her success and made great achievements. The Eagle team relied on free throws to score points and once chased to 31 to 33. However, after Cai Mingxia invested, it was not long before the time was up. The Li team defeated the Eagle team with 36 to 31.

Then, the Green team played against the Ya team in the women's group, with Wu Shijian and Liu Hesheng officiating. Green team Ah Yuan scored the first record with one arm. Sun Fengzhu did not get in. Ming Yuan added two more. Zhu Jinwei made a penalty. The Green team led remotely with 7 to 0. When Qian Mengyue made a contribution on the baseline, the first quarter ended. The Ya team trailed by 2 to 7. In the second quarter, Green team Liu Zhenbao replaced Cao Manli, and the momentum was even stronger. When it was 15 to 4, Ah Yuan took a short break due to a foot injury, and Manlu came on the field. The Ya team also transferred Wang Zhelun from Zhu Lanzhen. The first half ended, and the Green team took the lead with 17 to 9. After changing baskets, both sides changed their formations. The Ya team showed a tired look, and the Green team did whatever they wanted. In the third quarter, the Green team had 29 points and the Ya team had 10 points. In the last quarter, Ya team Zhu Jiazhen graduated from fouling. The Green team transferred Lu Huijun and Wu Meimou, and they could still control it with ease. When the final buzzer sounded, the Green team defeated the Ya team with 37 to 11.

In the last match of the men's elimination round, the Tung Wah team played against the Pu team, with referees Huang Cunrui and Liu Hesheng. After contact, Chen Xianglong scored first. Pu team Chen Wenzao and Tian Zhaoqi scored two points, and Zhou Dajun scored from a distance. They were all equal. Tung Wah Da Yun scored in succession and advanced with 10 to 7. The Pu team was unwilling to show weakness, and Zhao Guiquan and Huang Wencheng went hand in hand to create a tie of 12 points each. The Pu team worked hard and raised their heads with 23 to 17. When Xianglong held the ball in, the first half ended, and the Tung Wah team was at a disadvantage with 19 to 23.

After the break, the Tung Wah team replaced Chen Xianglong with Jia Youliang. The Pu team still led the way. Tung Wah team Li Yao transferred Youliang, once approaching with 27 to 31. However, the Pu team refused to relax and immediately took the lead by nine points with 36 to 27. The Tung Wah team made a desperate struggle, and soon surpassed with 48 to 45. When time ran out, the Tung Wah team narrowly defeated the Pu team by half a ball with 51 to 50 and will compete with Jianle for the elimination championship.

### Table Tennis Group B Sees an Upset: Red and White Defeats Top-Seeded Ling Team

Today Continues with Five Group B Matches

In the fourth session of the Table Tennis League, the other day, the Group A Hua Mei team was scheduled to play against the Group B Postal team, but the Postal team was unable to compete due to other uses of the postal service's table tennis room. Therefore, both sides agreed to reschedule. In another match, the Red and White team of the Group B division one faced the Ling team at the Guohuo Table Tennis Room. The Red and White team, comprised of students from St. John's University, had participated in four matches, with two wins and two losses, and had already lost hope of being selected. The Ling team was the top seed in their division, having won all five of their matches, boasting strong players. In this match, the Red and White players were determined to win at all costs, playing with exceptional effort. Although the Ling team took an early lead of two to one, unfortunately, in the fourth group, Jin Shisheng of the Ling team was defeated one to two by Dong Shaolong, the captain of the Red and White team, creating a tense situation. In the final decisive group match, Rong Wenbang, the main player of the Ling team, battled fiercely against Li Chuanqi, a strong player from the opposing team. Rong, lacking in practice, made many errant shots. Chuanqi fought tirelessly, ultimately winning in straight sets against Rong Wenbang. As a result, the Red and White team defeated the top-seeded Ling team three to two, a true masterpiece of an upset. The match results of the two teams are recorded below:

(Red and White)　　Score　　　(Ling Team)

Cai Senfu　　11—21　21—16　16—21　　Ji Rutang

Zhou Zhixing　　21—18　21—19　　Zhang Yuefu

Yao Jimei　　13—21　16—21　　Ye Shouchang

Dong Shaolong　　21—18　18—21　21—18　　Jin Shisheng

Li Chuanqi　　21—19　21—19　　Rong Wenbang

Today (the 6th) continues with five Group B matches. The postal service's table tennis room has been relocated to the downstairs consumer cooperative near the entrance, where matches will continue as scheduled. The two teams scheduled for today's matches should take note. The organizers hope that the winning teams will promptly submit the score sheets to the League office the following day to facilitate progress. The schedule for today is recorded below:

Yucai — Post Three (Group B3) 5:30 PM Postal Service

Haiguang — Zhongji (Group B1) 7:00 PM Postal Service

### Kyushu Iwa Football Game Postponed, Today Central Art vs. Huaguang Clash

Yesterday's Democratic Cup football match between Kyushu and Iwa was not held due to intermittent rain, although the field was not muddy. If the weather clears today, the match between Central Art and Huaguang will kick off at 4:30 PM at the Nanshi Stadium, with referee Ma Youyu and linesmen Ni Shiyao and Yan Yougeng. Central Art is the "local bully" of Nanshi, currently holding an undefeated record. They previously overwhelmed Samsung with a score of three to one and forced a draw of two to two with the leading team. Their remaining formidable opponents are only Kyushu and Huaguang, so they harbor ambitions of winning the cup. Today's match against Huaguang is of great significance. If Central Art can win, the only team capable of competing with them would be Kyushu. However, Huaguang is a seasoned and experienced team, with fast-moving forwards and a strong defense. Wu Qixiang's powerful kicks are particularly capable of suppressing attacks, so when they play well, they can make any strong team bow their heads. They are not easy to deal with. The outcome of this match holds great potential. (If the weather is abnormal, inquiries can be made by calling 〇2—7〇746)

### Industry and Commerce on the Brink of Collapse: Calls to Correct Public Utility Index, Committee to Discuss Suppression Measures Tomorrow

[Our Newspaper] The city's public utility pricing index has been soaring in recent days, and citizens are already overwhelmed by the burden. The City Council's Public Utilities Committee has scheduled a committee meeting for tomorrow (the 7th) at 3:00 PM at the City Council to discuss reasonable suppression measures. It is reported that some councilors believe that the continuous and drastic increase in the public utility index has directly and indirectly had the most serious and worst impact on citizens. They are determined to speak out righteously at tomorrow's meeting, plead for the seven million citizens, and firmly advocate for the abolition of the public utility index to relieve people's difficulties and stabilize social order. It is also rumored that three or four councilors who have relationships with various public utility agencies (employees of the Public Utilities Bureau and heads of water and electricity institutions) will recuse themselves at the time to prevent accusations from society.

[Our Newspaper] Since the continuous surge in the public utility index threatened the livelihoods of seven million citizens in Shanghai, forcing large and small industrial and commercial businesses to the brink of collapse and affecting social stability, leaders from all walks of life have attached great importance to the matter. Jian Guansan, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, also deeply felt that the daily increase in the public utility index was indeed unbearable for all citizens, and factories in particular felt unable to cope. Production was far less than before, and transportation and locking became increasingly difficult. The state of exhaustion was increasing day by day. If this continued, the consequences would be unimaginable. He believed that this issue was extremely serious, so he specially sent a letter to the mayor, instructing various public utility units to promptly discuss and improve measures to reduce the burden on the people and the industrial community, so as to maintain production and promote stability.

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, major flour factories, and the Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association have all made urgent appeals on this issue. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and employees of the British Waterworks have also sent letters providing explanations.

Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Command, the Songhu Garrison Command, and the Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting prompt and effective measures to suppress the index. The telegram stated: "According to a telegram from the Municipal Hotel and Commerce Association, the public utility pricing index is leaping wildly day by day. Our member stores are unable to cope even with their total operating income. The electricity bill alone has exceeded the total income by several times, causing extreme distress (the situation in each store can be verified by sending personnel for inspection). If the water and electricity companies cut off water and power due to unpaid fees, they should be responsible for all resulting problems. We hereby request that this be forwarded to the military and political authorities for review, with utmost urgency and gratitude." The telegram further stated that the public utility industry's self-created "pricing index" and daily price increases were unprecedented in any city and a violation of fairness.

Monthly electricity bills often reach billions. Taking the hotel industry as an example, the Yangzi Hotel's total operating income for the entire last month was only 1.7 billion yuan, while the electricity bill for last month, calculated at 790,000 times the base rate, reached 4.2 billion yuan. In industry, the Yongfeng Yiji Dyeing and Weaving Factory's electricity bill for last month, calculated at 790,000 times the base rate, reached a staggering 4.6 billion yuan. The same is true for water and telephone bills. If this frenzy is not curbed, the city's industry and commerce will be forced to go bankrupt to pay for public utilities. There will be no money for public donations, taxes, or worker salaries. This alone is enough to bring this city to the brink of collapse. This is a disaster that strips the skin and should not be ignored. We urge you to investigate and take fair and effective measures to suppress the index, and not allow it to exhaust resources and sacrifice the city's industry and commerce. The matter is extremely urgent and awaiting your command.

### Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Petitions Authorities to Stop Public Utility Index Increase

[Central News Agency] The public utility companies in this city are announcing daily increases in the public utility index, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has petitioned the Municipal Government and the Municipal Council to promptly stop this practice. The original petition is recorded below: "It has been observed that the prices of daily necessities have recently tended to stabilize. The index published at the beginning of this month has not had a stimulating effect. The local authorities are working to study wage calculation standards to ensure that both labor and management can be maintained. However, the public utility enterprises announced a pricing index of 950,000 times on the 5th, while the wages earned by hundreds of thousands of workers in the city are only 370,000 times the base rate. Compared to the index, this is exceeded by two-thirds. Public utilities, as the name suggests, are related to the public life of society and are different from general for-profit enterprises. How can there be such a unique index that clearly deprives the public of its livelihood? Furthermore, the salaries of all foreign and some senior Chinese employees of electricity, lighting, telephone, and water companies are calculated in US dollars, and their generous treatment within China exceeds that of wealthy officials. Recently, the prices of all goods have generally fallen, but the prices of public utilities have risen. If effective measures are not taken immediately to stop this, the public in the city will be unable to live, and social order will be difficult to maintain. Furthermore, industry and commerce will be forced to close down sooner rather than later. It is recalled that public utilities previously wanted to price in Customs Gold Units, but this was stopped by the Municipal Council, and public anger subsided. Now, they are creating new names and leaving behind endless harm. We are compelled to urgently submit this document, pleading that you promptly stop this for the benefit of the public."

Water Company Employees Are Also Deeply Affected by the Soaring Prices

A letter from a group of employees of the British Shanghai Waterworks stated: "The base salaries of public utility employees are generally low. Last month, each person received only 6 million yuan in wages, and the company does not offer preferential treatment for water used by employees. Therefore, employees are also deeply affected by the soaring water prices. Calculating the salary index at 370,000 times the base rate, the employees' salaries should be more than 20 million yuan, while the water bill must be at least more than 10 million yuan." Since worker wages are low and company expenses are reduced, there is no reason for the public utility index to rise daily. Even employees of the Waterworks are affected by high water bills, so the suffering of the general public can be imagined.

### Wang Weiheng Takes Over as Head of Finance Bureau: Handover Ceremony Held Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] Qian Jianfu, the acting director of the Finance Bureau, has been transferred to the position of Deputy General Manager of the Bank of Shanghai. The position of director has been filled by Major General Wang Weiheng, appointed by the Municipal Government. The handover ceremony between the new and outgoing directors was held in the bureau's conference room at 10:30 AM yesterday, with the participation of over 100 heads and staff members of various departments. The ceremony was simple and solemn, and concluded at 11:20 AM.

### Tao Yishan Arrives Yesterday, Chen Baotai Takes Office Next Week

[Central News Agency] The new Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, Tao Yishan, officially arrived at the bureau at 2:00 PM yesterday to assume his duties. The new Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Chen Baotai, is scheduled to officially take office next Monday.

[Another Dispatch] The new Director of the Education Bureau, Zhao Jialin, is scheduled to arrive at the Municipal Education Bureau today to handle the handover.

### Banks and Financial Institutions Have Overnight Funds: Central Bank Fully Allocates Cash

[Our Newspaper] As of yesterday, all banks, financial institutions, and trust companies in this city have stopped issuing banker's drafts. Banker's drafts that have already been issued will be collected as much as possible. At the same time, in order to meet the needs of banks and financial institutions for turnover funds, the Central Bank began yesterday to fully allocate cash according to the amount of each bank and financial institution's overnight deposits in the National Bank. This is divided into 30% in silver dollars (priced at 4 million yuan each), 35% in cash, and 35% in National Bank fixed-amount banker's drafts. Therefore, as of yesterday, each bank and financial institution has been able to fully meet the needs of customers for cash withdrawals.

Certified Checks Continue to Be Issued

Furthermore, according to a person in charge of the Bankers Association who spoke to our reporter: Since the issuance of banker's drafts by banks and financial institutions was suspended yesterday, the situation regarding meeting customer needs has been quite good because the National Bank has been able to fully allocate cash. As for interbank certified checks, which are commonly used between financial institutions, because they are only used for turnover within the industry and are fundamentally different in nature from banker's drafts, they will still be issued as usual when needed between financial institutions.

### April's Three-Union Rice Ration Extended to the 10th

According to the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee: The rice ration for the third union in April has been delayed due to excessive freight costs, which could not be raised in time. The original deadline was extended to the 5th. Because a portion of the rationed rice has not yet been shipped out of the warehouse, the deadline has been extended again to the 10th of this month to accommodate a portion of citizens who have not yet purchased their rationed rice. Furthermore, the committee has largely raised enough rice for the May ration. The first phase of the May ration will begin after the third phase of the April ration is completed.

### Weekly Export Exchange Settlement Amount Less Than Two Million US Dollars

[Central News Agency] It has been learned that the total amount of export exchange settlement in Shanghai for the entire last month was US$7,715,335.16, which is much lower than in March. The average weekly export figure is less than US$2 million.

### Robber Murders, Three Criminals Executed by Firing Squad

[Our Newspaper] Following the execution of Tong Bofu, the main culprit in a plot to commit illegal acts, the police station yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM also executed three robbery-murderers by firing squad at the North Datong Road: Yan Jinxiang (28 years old, from Yancheng), Xia Yifei (27 years old, from Yancheng), and Luo Wenxiang (24 years old, from Yancheng). It was found that Yan and Luo colluded to rob the home of Li Hu on the 8th of last month at No. 90 Puqingfang, Datong Road. They opened fire when resisting arrest, and Wang Jie, a patrol officer from the Zhabei Branch Police Station who led the police to encircle and arrest them, was shot and killed. Afterwards, the police station sent personnel to pursue the case and arrested 24 people, including Yan Jinxiang. After separate interrogations, it was learned that Yan and Luo Wenxiang were the culprits who shot and killed the five patrol officers who resisted arrest at the time. Xia Yifei was a major criminal who opened fire and killed the victim, Tan Shifa, during a robbery on October 8th of last year at No. 822 Datong Road. The police station believes that during this period of martial law, they cannot tolerate such people who disregard the law and act recklessly. In addition to sending the 21 suspects, including Wu Jinru, to the court for trial in accordance with the Regulations on the Punishment of Bandits, the police station specially sentenced the three leading criminals, Yan, Luo, and Xia, to the most severe punishment for robbery and murder. After being presented to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for approval by the police station, they were tied up and taken to the scene for execution by firing squad to serve as a warning.

### Illegal Group Cracked Down in Lotus Temple, Main Culprit Tong Bofu Executed by Firing Squad, Over 100 Accomplices to Be Treated Leniently

[Our Newspaper] On the 26th of last month, the Police Headquarters, based on a report from Feng Wenxiao, the chief of the Huangpu Police Branch, cracked down on an illegal secret group posing as the so-called "Presidential Office First Social Supervision Group" at the Lotus Temple on Chengdu South Road. The police arrested the main culprit, Tong Bofu, and over 100 accomplices, including Liu Yukun, and seized 21 long and short firearms and various forged seals and documents. After investigation, the criminals confessed without denying. The case was presented to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for approval, and Tong was sentenced to the most severe punishment in accordance with Articles 2 and 7 of the Shanghai Emergency Security Regulations. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Tong was taken to the front of the Lotus Temple for execution by firing squad.

Over 100 Accomplices Were Mostly Deceived

The 100 accomplices, including Liu Yukun, were mostly ignorant youths who were deceived into joining the group, which is excusable. It is said that Director Mao will treat them leniently. According to the main culprit, Tong Bofu, 38 years old, from Hunan, after establishing an illegal group under the name of the "Presidential Office First Social Supervision Group," many ignorant people joined the group. One reason was that the organization's name of the Presidential Office was quite appealing. Another reason was that the so-called "investigation certificate" issued by the organization listed absurd terms such as holding the certificate entitles the holder to free rides on state-run planes and various vehicles and ships, and the holder is allowed to enter entertainment venues, martial law areas, and fortress areas.

The Real Purpose is to Gather Wealth and Plot Rebellion

However, the real purpose was to collect wealth and plot to support the Communist bandits when they attacked Shanghai. In addition, the organization dared to openly send documents to the Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and the Police Bureau requesting the supply of investigation materials. After receiving this information, Feng Wenxiao, the chief of the Huangpu Police Branch, immediately secretly reported to Director Mao because the name of the group had never been heard before. After inquiring with the Presidential Office and confirming that there was no such organization, the Criminal Division sent Section Chief Yao of the Fifth Section to be responsible for the investigation and sent personnel to secretly join the organization as members. On April 26th, after learning that the organization was holding a secret meeting at the Lotus Temple, the police sent a large number of officers to rush to the scene and arrest all the main culprits and accomplices in one fell swoop.

### Stock Exchange Temporarily Closed

The Stock Exchange temporarily closed yesterday. According to authorities at the exchange, the temporary closure will not be long. It is expected that it will resume in a week or so, so that the market prices of various stocks can be renegotiated and revised to match the market situation.

### Cotton Yarn Sales Dull, 16-Count Coarse Yarn Uniquely Popular

The cotton yarn market was stable yesterday, and the prices of various yarns saw slight increases, but actual sales were sluggish. The price of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was the same as the closing price yesterday afternoon, with no change. Jincheng yarn was 740 million, a slight increase of 20 million. 40-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 720 million, an increase of 100 million yuan. The prices of 32-count yarns from various mills saw slight increases of 10 million. 21-count Double Horse warehouse-made yarn was 470 million, and spot goods were 510 million, both up 30 million. 20-count yarn increased by 20 to 30 million. 16-count yarn was uniquely popular, with sales more active than other yarns, increasing by 20 million. The prices of 10-count yarns from various mills all increased.

Cotton Cloth Lingers

Due to news of the opening of southbound transport, the cotton cloth market was slightly stimulated, and the market lingered steadily. There was little trading of Four Gentlemen serge outside the market, and the trading of fine cloth was quite lively. The foothold of low-end fine cloth was particularly firm. Due to the suspension of interbank lending, the trading of shipping out goods to realize funds and shipping out funds to purchase goods disappeared, so large-scale transactions were extremely rare.

### Rice Market Trend Firm and Upward

The rice market trend turned firm, and arrivals were visibly reduced. There were not many samples for sale, and rice shops continued to increase their stocks. The market trend was firm and upward, and prices increased. White japonica rice at the South Market was 22 million, and thin rice was 22.8 million yuan, each up 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan compared to the previous day. Early rice increased by more than 10%, trading at 22 million yuan. Indica rice was relatively lower, with milled indica at 19 million yuan. White japonica rice at the North Rice Market was 22 million, up 10%, but there were not many transactions.

Edible oil prices rose. Absorption continued on this street, and sales were very smooth. Soybean oil reached a high of 100 million yuan, and the closing price was 92 million, an increase of 6 million yuan. Rapeseed oil reached a high of 84 million, and the closing price was 76 million, a strong increase of 8 million yuan. A cask of rapeseed oil was 84 million, also up 8 million yuan. A small cart of sesame oil was 72 million yuan. Soybean cake has not yet opened.

The flour market trend turned firm as prices for all goods outside the ring generally increased, and sentiment turned firm. Retailers were absorbing strongly, and prices generally jumped by 20%. The opening price for old trucks was 5.4 million, and the supply in the central market was extremely scarce, and there were very few transactions. The market opened at a high price of 5.8 million in the afternoon. Battleship flour was 5.2 million, Red Bee flour was 4.8 million. Bran was also expensive, with Fufeng large bags at 4.4 million yuan.

Grains rose across the board. Winter beans and spring beans were both trading at 15 million, up about 20% compared to the previous day. Mulberry garden beans were selling extremely well, and the market rose to 16 million yuan yesterday. Broad beans rose again by 20%, with Xieqiao selected green beans at 37.5 million. Peanut kernels also saw strong increases. Sesame seeds, corn, and sorghum all rose in unison.

Tea Market Slightly Soft

Since buyers all adopted a wait-and-see attitude, transactions were rare, and the trend has long been in a state of stillness. Yesterday's market was even more desolate due to continuous rain. However, inquiries with sellers revealed that prices remained unchanged, although the foothold was slightly softening.

### Gold Hovering at Low Levels

[Our Newspaper] The gold market situation remained sluggish yesterday, hovering at low levels. Because banks and financial institutions can no longer issue banker's drafts, transactions have invisibly become cash and fixed-amount banker's drafts. Therefore, the actual price has changed from the banker's draft price to the cash price. All parties are wary of the Garrison Headquarters' emergency regulations. Some firms have temporarily suspended trading and switched to gold and silver exchange business.

In the morning, spot goods outside the market were sold off by general banks and financial institutions to make up for the shortage of banker's drafts. Manufacturers also released large quantities of physical goods to pay electricity bills and daily expenses. With both forces acting together, the supply was abundant and there were few buyers.

The opening price was 170 million and 200 million, but then fell to 160 million and 190 million, and the smallest price was 150 million and 180 million. The afternoon closing price returned to 170 million and 200 million.

The afternoon was slightly firmer, rising to 190 million and 220 million, and finally falling again to 180 million and 210 million, a further drop of 10 million compared to the previous day.

The exchange rate of US dollars outside the market followed suit. The morning opening price was 3.5 million and 4 million, and it fell to 3 million and 3.5 million. The afternoon closing price remained at 3.5 million and 4 million. It was said to have risen in the afternoon, with an initial price of 3.8 million and 4.3 million, but finally fell again to 3.7 million and 4.2 million, a further drop of 100,000.

Another report: The ratio of US dollars to gold yesterday was 48 and 51, and the ratio to silver dollars was 6.8 and 7.2 yuan.

Another report: Yesterday's gold jewelry in silver shops remained suspended. Most silver shops were closed all day and were not seen to open.

Another report: Yesterday's gold and silver exchange market in office buildings saw prices of 34 and 37 in the morning, falling to 33 and 35. The afternoon closing price was 35 and 37. The afternoon was slightly lower to 34.5 and 36.5 yuan. Transactions of factory bars were rare. The morning price was 37 and 39, and the afternoon was slightly lower to 36 and 38. Transactions were quite active.

[Our Newspaper] According to the Public Utilities Bureau yesterday, the public utility pricing index for May 6th was 880,000 times the base rate. After continuous sharp increases in recent days, it finally decreased slightly yesterday. It is unknown whether this is the result of unanimous criticism and attacks from society.

### The Authorities Change Salary Calculation Methods, Cost of Living Index No Longer Published, Three Principles of Salary Payment Confirmed, to be Implemented Next Week After Decision

[Central News Agency] In recent months, prices have risen significantly. The cost of living index salary calculation method is no longer sufficient to maintain the livelihood of employees. The authorities are currently discussing with relevant parties how to improve the salary calculation method. As a result of the exchange of opinions, three principles have now been determined: (1) the cost of living index will be discontinued; (2) future salary calculation methods must maintain the minimum living standards of workers; (3) salary payments will utilize various means, such as rice, gold yuan notes, silver dollars, and other valuables. This method will be finalized within days and implemented next week. The cost of living index for this month will no longer be published.

[Central News Agency] In these extraordinary times, the current practice of using the cost of living index to calculate the salaries of employees in this city is no longer in line with practical needs. The authorities are paying close attention to this issue. After days of research by various parties, a new decision will be made regarding salary payment methods in this city. It is reported that this new method will be implemented as soon as the final decision is made. The details of the method are as follows: (1) the cost of living index salary calculation method will not be adopted; (2) the minimum salary shall not be lower than four dou of rice; (3) the base salary will be converted to silver dollars, but the discount will be extremely low, approximately between 10% and 20%.

### Order on Rectifying Military Discipline Revised and Published by the Garrison Command

[Central News Agency] The Shanghai Garrison Command revised the "Order on Rectifying Military Discipline in Shanghai" on the 5th as follows: (1) Soldiers are absolutely prohibited from going out without a valid reason.

### Gold Control Bureau to Dispatch Personnel Today to Inspect Banks and Financial Houses

[Our Newspaper] According to Director Bi of the Gold Control Bureau yesterday, after the banks and financial houses stopped issuing bank drafts on the 5th, the authorities have ordered all banks and financial houses to recover all bank drafts issued within three days from the 5th. The Gold Control Bureau has now decided to dispatch 20 groups of inspectors, two people per group, from the 6th to inspect all banks and financial houses to investigate the amount of bank drafts that have been recovered and not recovered, and to supervise all banks and financial houses to recover the issued bank drafts as much as possible before the deadline. On the one hand, all banks and financial houses are still required to report the amount of bank drafts that have been recovered and not recovered to the Gold Control Bureau and the Central Bank within three days. For the unrecovered bank drafts, they must deposit the full amount of reserve funds in the national bank for the holders to cash in the future.

### Culprit of the Huge Fire in Western Shanghai Captured, 20,000 Refugees Have Obtained Shelter, Various Circles Send Cakes and Porridge

[Our Newspaper] A large fire occurred near Zhongshan Park on Changning Road in western Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon. The disaster area is approximately 200,000 square meters, and the number of victims reached more than 20,000. The volunteer police of the Old Zha District sent more than 300 catties of large cakes and steamed buns the night before yesterday. The Jing'an District Office sent more than 50 catties of large cakes and steamed buns. The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association drove porridge carts to the disaster area to distribute more than three dan of porridge to relieve the fire refugees. More than 20,000 refugees were housed in five or six schools and major factories. The arsonist, a woman named Gao Bian, 28 years old, from northern Jiangsu, was captured by the French Concession police station. According to her confession, the fire was caused by carelessness when cooking at 2 p.m. on the 4th. A spark fell into a pile of straw. Because the surrounding area was full of shantytowns and the wind was strong, the fire became uncontrollable. At 4 p.m. yesterday, the French Concession District Office invited local gentry and relevant groups to meet at the Huierkang Tea Room opposite Zhongshan Park to discuss relief and aftermath arrangements for the refugees, hoping that the local gentry and charitable organizations could provide relief so that more than 20,000 refugees would not be displaced.

### To Facilitate Population Evacuation, the Garrison Headquarters Decided on Six Items

### Suggestions to Organize Cooperatives to Take Over Public Utilities, Wang Xiaolai Pleads for Manufacturers and Citizens

[Central News Agency] The price index for public utilities such as water and electricity has risen wildly in recent days, and manufacturers and small citizens alike feel overwhelmed. Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Chinese National Manufacturers Association, in view of this, specially suggested organizing cooperatives to take over and operate them reasonably, so as to seek happiness for the people. The original letter is recorded as follows: "To the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the Shanghai Industrial Association: It is an irrefutable principle that local public utilities, especially water, electricity, and telephone services, should be run by the city. Even if we take a step back, water, electricity, and telephone services should at least be operated by cooperatives organized by users, so that individual economies can become collective economies. Because public utilities are monopolistic undertakings, they should seek the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. If private individuals are allowed to operate them, they will inevitably aim at making profits and will not be able to seek the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. For example, water, electricity, and telephone services are like using needles to pierce people for blood transfusions, so that people can meet the needs of their lives, and at the same time perform blood-drawing operations, so that people gradually become thin and even die. When Shanghai is in a period of developed production and economic prosperity, although this kind of blood that is drawn out has more benefits than the blood that is put in, the losses are compensated by gains in other areas, so people are not aware of the magnitude of the damage. But now Shanghai's production is almost stagnant, the economy is on the verge of exhaustion, and the cost of public utilities, especially the cost of water, electricity, and telephone services, is still the same as in the days of previous development and prosperity, and it gives and asks for whatever it wants, so it is appropriate that users are unable to afford it. The situation recorded in the newspapers on May 5 is only the tip of the iceberg. Of course, the index of public utility costs is independent and growing day by day, which is one of the reasons, but the most fundamental reason is that private monopoly makes it impossible to save money and impossible to replace. Therefore, the fundamental solution is to take back the city's operations. As a last resort, users should immediately unite to organize cooperatives to take over, so as to achieve the goal of "I am for everyone and everyone is for me," so that they can seek the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. Therefore, I respectfully send this telegram to you, please understand and proceed, and the citizens of Shanghai will be deeply grateful. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Chinese National Manufacturers Association."

### Flood Prevention and Afforestation in Guangdong Province

— Huang Huang

[Guangzhou, 28th] Guangdong Province suffers from severe floods, and the flooded area is vast. Those who talk about flood prevention mostly focus on building embankments. Because embankment construction is simple and its effects are easily seen, people are eager for quick success and instant benefits, abandoning dredging and tending towards embankment construction. However, it is not known that while embankment construction is important, the emphasis on building embankments and the neglect of dredging often lead to shallower riverbeds due to accumulated sediment, which inevitably affects higher river water levels. If the water level is raised, the embankment must be correspondingly higher to prevent flooding. If the embankment is higher, and there is still accumulated sediment and no dredging, it will inevitably cause the riverbed to become shallower. This cycle continues year after year, often leading to the riverbed being higher than the embankment. If there are torrential floods or the embankment foundation is slightly weak, it will easily collapse. Then the people and livestock within the embankment will all become fish and turtles, and it will be unstoppable. Furthermore, there are many embankments on both sides of the river, more than a thousand. The embankment foundations must be of varying strength and height. Those with solid foundations, strong foundations, and high foundations can fortunately escape the disaster. At this time, the water势 (the force of the water) will inevitably tend towards those with weak foundations and low foundations and destroy them, forcing each embankment to compete to strengthen its foundation and repair its embankment to protect itself. This consumes wealth and effort, and the people cannot live in peace, but still panic all day long, fearing the water. Therefore, it is necessary to simultaneously dredge the river channels in a planned manner, clean up the sediment, so that the water flows smoothly, the floods lose their power, and then add embankments to confine them, then the flood prevention problem in Guangdong will be easily solved.

Furthermore, the rivers in Guangdong Province have upstream areas that are mostly high mountains and ridges, and downstream areas that are all open plains, and there is a lack of lakes and marshes to regulate the river water. Therefore, if there is a mountain flood, it will rush thousands of miles, causing floods. Therefore, the flood prevention strategy in Guangdong Province, in addition to the above-mentioned dredging of river channels and the construction of embankments in the downstream areas, should pay attention to building more sluice gates and dams, repairing ponds and building lakes in the upper and middle reaches to regulate floods and contain water, so as to reduce the power of floods and reduce the occurrence of water disasters.

Afforestation is one of the fundamental methods of flood prevention. However, the benefits of forests for flood prevention are not seen overnight, and are often ignored by the people. The rulers have even less intention of addressing it. Although far-sighted politicians know the importance of forests and strongly advocate it, China has even designated a Tree Planting Day. However, the rulers who came after rarely sincerely implemented it, but merely敷衍 story, held it as a routine event, and did not engage in practical afforestation. May I ask how much has been planted in the space after designating Tree Planting Day for several decades and planting trees every year? Not only is the number of trees planted pitifully small, but there is also no tending or protection after planting. The survivors are only like those who have survived in a desperate situation. Even if they are fortunate enough to survive, they have already suffered from the cutting of firewood and from the destruction of the army before they have grown into timber. Therefore, trees are planted every year, but no forests are formed. If you look at the public forest farms throughout the province, which one is not disordered in its forest appearance and withering in its trees? This is sufficient proof. Even if there are some private forest farms of the people that have become forests, they are only purely economic forests, with very few flood prevention forests. That is, they all start from the economic point of view to create forests, and very few start from the flood prevention point of view to create forests. Although afforestation is a good thing, regardless of which starting point is used, it is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and it is beneficial to flood prevention and drought resistance. But it is not as good as focusing on flood prevention forests, so that it can not only obtain the benefits of timber, but also receive the function of regulating water and drought, and also have the effect of flood prevention. It is really a good remedy for the frequent floods in this province. Therefore, there is a special chapter in the theory of ordinary afforestation, so it will not be discussed. Now only discuss flood prevention afforestation as left:

Afforestation of Riverbanks

Afforestation of riverbanks is closely related to flood prevention. The effect of riverbank forests is great. The prominent ones are: (1) Conserving water resources, stopping sand flow, and reducing siltation in the riverbed. (2) Regulating drought and flood, increasing the production of crops. (3) Increasing the riverbank cover, preserving the soil and water, avoiding riverbank collapse and damaging the farmland along the bank. (4) Regulating the river water flow, preventing the river water from overflowing and drying up, and avoiding affecting all water conservancy. (5) Clarifying the river water, curbing the phenomenon of mountain floods and avoiding flood disasters. (6) Harmonizing the climate and increasing the scenery of the embankment, etc. The other direct and indirect benefits are too numerous to mention. Some say that although the benefits of afforestation of riverbanks are universal, and Guangdong often has typhoons that may shake the dike forest and harm the dike foundation. It is not seen its benefits, but its harms are seen. However, it is not known that if the afforestation of riverbanks is planted sporadically, the wind is strong and the forest is small, or there may be this disadvantage. If the entire riverbank is afforested, so that the dike forest is deeply rooted and intertwined, the wind force is great, and there is no damage. However, the most important thing to pay attention to is the problem of tree species in the dike forest. It is appropriate to choose those with tough trunks, small leaves, dense roots, and wind and humidity resistance. Therefore, if the afforestation of riverbanks can carefully select tree species and plant them universally, there are really a hundred benefits and not a single harm. In the Soviet Union, in the Volga River, Don River, Niba River, and Ural River basins, forests are planted and logging is forbidden along the banks of the river. This is sufficient proof. On the other hand, in the river basins of this province, the mountains surround both banks, most of which are bare mountains. On the banks of each river, landslides are seen everywhere, and mountain soil and sand flow and silt up the riverbed. This is why the flood is coming. Therefore, in the future, we should advocate afforestation of riverbanks and plan to set up nurseries in all Jiangyan banks, and universally afforest all mountains and fields within one mile on both sides of the upper and middle reaches and the base areas of the lower reaches to benefit flood prevention.

Afforestation of Water Sources: It is found that the water sources of the main tributaries of each river in this province, except for the Xijiang River, are all within the territory of this province, and the upper reaches of each river mostly belong to high mountains and ridges, with vast areas and large rainfall. However, there are no forests to contain and slow down the rain. The so-called "Nanyong sprinkles wet stones, Qujiang is three feet high, Qingyuan passes the roof ridge" in the folk songs is enough to fully express the phenomenon of my containment of water sources. According to the facts, heavy rain in the upper reaches of the Beijiang River arrives in Qujiang in one day, Yingde Lianjiangkou in another day, and Qingyuan in two days. It can be seen that the folk songs are not completely false, and it is also enough to prove the importance of afforestation of water sources. Therefore, if Guangdong wants to fundamentally prevent and prevent floods, it must carry out afforestation of water sources in the water sources of the main tributaries of each river. The original natural forests in each water source must be managed, closed to mountains, strictly prohibited from logging, and protected against burning mountains, so that they can become the "invisible reservoirs" of each water source, to prevent drought and flood, which is the basic plan for flood prevention in Guangdong.

Sand Prevention Afforestation: In addition to the above-mentioned riverbank afforestation and water source afforestation, flood prevention afforestation in Guangdong must also pay attention to "sand prevention afforestation" in order to be complete. The so-called sand prevention afforestation refers to dividing an area within ten miles of the river bank of each main tributary of each river into a "sand prevention zone". All hills and barren mountains in the "sand prevention zone" must be completely afforested. It is intended to make the rainwater on the land along the banks of the river must be clarified and deposited by the forest before flowing into the river, thereby avoiding mountain soil, sand flow, siltation, and facilitating river water flow and preventing floods.

Guangdong is the only subtropical region in China, with deep soil, abundant people and abundant resources. It is a pity that floods are frequent, which is the biggest shortcoming of the natural environment in this province. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent floods. The best way to prevent disasters is to pay equal attention to flood prevention and afforestation, treat both the symptoms and the root causes, and use them for each other, hoping to eliminate floods invisibly. I remember when I visited Taiwan last year, I felt that the climate and soil quality in Taiwan were very bad, and the rainfall was out of balance, and the wind disasters were severe. Compared with Guangdong, Guangdong can be said to be uniquely endowed by nature. It can make up for the deficiencies of nature by artificial means, build water conservancy, nurture forests, increase production, and improve agriculture, so that it has the name of Taiwan Treasure Island today. Now, with the superiority of the natural environment endowed by Guangdong and the addition of construction, can't it become a perfect Southern Paradise?

### The Lingfu Ship in Guangzhou, the Engine Has Not Been Oiled for a Long Time, the Shells Are Rusty

[Guangzhou, 30th] Since March 27th, the Lingfu warship suddenly received an order from the Navy Headquarters to sail from Shanghai to the White Swan Lake in Guangzhou and anchor. Her whereabouts have puzzled people here. The Yangtze River defense is so tense now, why would a warship like the Lingfu leave its post? The reporter visited the ship on the morning of the 31st, and was received by Deng Tianjie, the captain of the ship, and He Shuduo, the vice-captain. When the reporter boarded the ship, he saw the soldiers on the ship scattered and scattered, lying on the side of the railing, looking at the sea, with a rather depressed attitude. According to the captain and vice-captain, the Lingfu was returned to China together with the Yinghe and Chongqing ships last year. The current captain of the Lingfu was the one who drove the Lingzhu warship at that time. They all felt a sense of depression that was difficult to vent about the uprising of the Chongqing ship. They said: We and the officers and soldiers of the Chongqing ship received training together in the United Kingdom. We have a good personal relationship. After returning to China, we were stationed in the Yangtze River, and the Chongqing ship was stationed in the north. After a few months of separation, we only knew after they left. As for why they left? What happened after they left? I think this is what the community must care about, but since the Chongqing ship left, we have been afraid to say anything even if we have feelings. We can only say: Such a result of the Chongqing ship: dying under its own artillery fire is a pity. The captain also said: Before coming to Guangzhou, we were originally in the Yangtze River to take charge of the defense. After the Chongqing ship left, we were transferred to Shanghai, and then to Guangzhou. Our current task is to train the navy in the South China region. They don't know when they will leave. There are currently about 200 officers and soldiers on the ship, more than 90% of whom are old soldiers who originally received training in the United Kingdom. Only 20 new recruits were sent to the ship for training. Most of the officers and soldiers on the ship are from Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Hubei, and fewer are from Fujian and Guangdong. The captain is from Fujian, and the vice-captain is from Zhejiang. Regarding the treatment of officers and soldiers on the ship, the captain said: It is similar to that of ordinary troops, and it is always impossible to maintain the current actual life. The vice-captain also lamented that the prices in Guangzhou are too expensive.

The reporter visited the ship once and saw that many of the ship's machines had not been oiled for a long time, and some rust could be seen on them. In particular, the shells of the four main guns at the bow and stern of the ship also had some rust on their warheads.

### Shantou Situation: Human Meat Cheaper Than Pork

[Shantou, 28th dispatch] Mid-level civil servants in Shantou currently receive monthly salaries of only a little over one thousand yuan. A month of hard work translates to only ten "shi jin" (approximately 5 kg) of rice. They are truly "serving the public on empty stomachs." Some employees of the National Tax Collection Bureau, due to excessively meager salaries, have been on strike since the 14th.

While all industries are in decline, the business of tobacco and liquor stores is uniquely prosperous. Sales of foreign cigarettes and liquor are very brisk. Fifty of the "Golfer" brand, or similar Navy brand cigarettes sell for 1,300 yuan, and there is no shortage of smokers. For low-level civil servants who need to socialize, a month's salary is just enough to buy a pack of cigarettes.

Barbershop prices have been repeatedly changed. From the end of the lunar year until now, they have risen from 50, 100, 150, 200, to 500 yuan. Many people, because of the sudden and drastic price increases, do not carry enough cash, leading to great embarrassment on the spot. Although the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Department has repeatedly issued "reprimands," the industry consistently disregards the laws, causing the general public to be troubled by their "three thousand green silk strands" (their hair).

Following the 10th and 11th, the market saw further chaos on the 16th. The Hong Kong dollar rose to a peak of 440 yuan in the evening. The "bull" markets on Yongping Road, Yongtai Road, and in front of the Small Park were particularly lively.

Shantou has four cinemas. Currently, the highest ticket price is 140 yuan. Due to the recent surge in population, each cinema is packed for every show. While there are certainly many with "gun-class" (power and influence) watching movies without paying, the situation is not as serious as in Shanghai and Guangzhou. This may be because there are relatively fewer soldiers and wounded soldiers.

Since large numbers of upper-class refugees from Beijing, Shanghai, and other places have arrived, the simple and honest customs of Shantou have been gradually changing to extravagance under the influence of the "Shanghai style." Shops or stalls selling foreign goods smuggled from Hong Kong are springing up like bamboo shoots after the rain. "Red men" in suits and leather shoes, and "green women" wearing nylon stockings and leather coats, are becoming increasingly common.

Although Shantou does not have public dance halls, the Friendship Association and the Customs Club hold dances every weekend. The wealthy families also often have "parties," filled with the scent of clothes and hair, the sound of drunken songs and embraces, overflowing with an atmosphere of revelry on the eve of destruction.

Along with rising prices and the difficulty of life, the number of prostitutes has also increased dramatically. At night, Zhongshan Park is filled with "flying orioles" (prostitutes), soliciting customers. The price for a night of pleasure is very low. The price of human flesh in Shantou is even lower than that of pork.

The sales of Hong Kong newspapers in Shantou total more than 5,000 copies. Recently, because shipping to Shantou is earlier, the price is no more expensive than Shantou newspapers, so the number of subscribers is increasing daily, and the sales of Shantou newspapers are declining day by day.

### Female Soldiers in Taiwan's New Army

[Taipei, 28th dispatch] In front of a banana grove in the northwest corner of Pingtung City, two rows of newly built gray brick barracks have been erected. This place used to be the residence of the Japanese Air Force officers, which was destroyed by American aircraft during the war. Now, the Army Training Command has hired workers to repair it, and in the midst of a desolate pile of broken bricks and tiles, two rows of simple barracks have been rebuilt.

Inside the barracks, a hundred or so modern girls arrived a few days ago. They are female intellectuals newly recruited by the Army Training Command from Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places. Most of them are middle school students, and a few have even received a university education. Leaving their homes and families, they have traveled from their distant hometowns, crossing the sea to the southern part of this subtropical island, to receive special training and prepare to shoulder a new mission for the country.

This group of girls took a boat from Shanghai to Taiwan. After landing in Keelung, they were quickly taken by bus to Pingtung. They voluntarily came to the barracks from schools and families to begin this less free group discipline life, but their strong will and self-confidence cannot completely bury their original innocence. When reporters, after passing through strict security lines of questioning and guidance, arrived at the barracks to interview them, some of them could not hold back and were already complaining. They told reporters with a bit of shyness and a smiling face: "We have no freedom, we can't see newspapers, we can't go out casually."

They have been in Pingtung for only a few days and have had little contact with the outside world. When they met the reporters, they stared with strange eyes at someone who seemed completely unfamiliar to them. When they learned that reporters had come to interview them, they became even more excited. Some of the young ladies from Shanghai, in particular, seemed very friendly. They competed to speak with the reporters in the Shanghai dialect, talking about everything under the sun.

Although they have already put on light green uniforms and skirts, their various styles of shoes and socks, and various styles of hairstyles, still cannot hide that they are young ladies from the city. Some still have permed and fluffy curly hair, some wear thick glasses, some are in the style of students, and some are like young ladies from secluded chambers. In the simple barracks, everything has not yet been arranged. A military blanket spread on the wooden floor is where they sleep and rest. Their only pastime is to talk with their comrades and sisters. The reporters asked them if they missed home. They said they wouldn't have come if they missed home. When asked if they were getting enough to eat, they said they were getting enough to eat, but the vegetables were a bit scarce. It is said that when they left Shanghai, many of their parents drove small cars, crying and laughing, to the pier to chase them back, but these stubborn young ladies would rather sacrifice the warmth of their families to accept hard training. This spirit is truly moving.

One of their team leaders told reporters that they are all unmarried young ladies, because the superiors stipulated that they would not accept married women. This time, a total of 400 female students were recruited from all over the country, and a large team will be established to concentrate on training in Pingtung. Only an advance unit has arrived now, because they have only been here for a few days, and everything is not yet ready. The barracks facilities and life management all seem disorganized. They are scheduled to begin training on the 13th. In addition to basic military training and physical activities, the training courses mainly include political work, medical assistance, and intelligence work skills training. During the training period, all are under military management. General Sun Li-jen pays close attention to the lives and training of these girls and is particularly cautious about the selection of instructors. Service officers and even service workers in the team headquarters have all been decided to be women. The selection of the team leader, it is said, is still under careful consideration by General Sun Li-jen.
