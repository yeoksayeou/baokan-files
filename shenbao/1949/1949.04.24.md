[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd, 6:20 PM Telegraph] The Nanjing government's evacuation work has already been completed. In the airspace above the airport, planes came and went, one after another, evacuating government personnel all day long. Until dusk, the sound of engines could still be heard. Huang Shao-gu, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, was one of the last to evacuate. From this morning, order within the city fell into extreme chaos due to the withdrawal of troops and police. Mobs and underground Communist Party workers were active everywhere, and looting and gunfire followed in succession. From the Presidential Palace and the residences of important officials to shops, all were subjected to their looting. Rice shops in the urban area were also targets of their looting. Most of the shops in the commercial district were closed. As of the time of this dispatch, no trace of the Communist army has been found in the city. At 11:00 AM, a notice from the Maintenance Committee was discovered on the street, bearing the names of Wu Yifang, President of Ginling Women's University, Chen Yuguang, Speaker of the Municipal Council, and Ma Qingyuan, a retired military officer. The volunteer police organized by the committee also appeared on the streets in the afternoon. When they encountered gatherings of people, they fired shots into the air to disperse them. Looting has almost not disappeared in various places, but order is slightly better than in the morning. A raging fire burned at the Xiaguan railway station; water, electricity, and telephone services were not affected. The "Yuan Datou" silver dollar reached a high of one million "gold yuan" for one silver dollar, then fell to 700,000, and in the evening fell to 500,000.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd, 10:30 PM Telegraph] The situation in the capital on the morning of the 23rd was chaotic, with many looting incidents. By noon, a Maintenance Committee had appeared, with Ma Qingyuan and Wu Yifang serving as Chairman and Vice Chairman, respectively. Local defense groups emerged to maintain order. In the afternoon, except for robberies still occurring in remote streets and alleys, order had mostly been restored on the main streets. By 9:00 PM, a large fire had started in Xiaguan, and many shells were falling in the Guanghua Gate area. The airport had been automatically destroyed, and warehouses had also automatically exploded. Currently, the Communist army has not yet entered the city. Electricity, telephone, and water supplies are normal and have not been interrupted. The city is gradually returning to tranquility.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 23rd] After Acting President Li and Premier He left Nanjing, their residences were looted.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 23rd] The Nanjing Maintenance Committee held a meeting today to discuss maintaining security in the capital city. In addition, the remaining police force has also recruited volunteers to form a motorcycle patrol to patrol the entire city. Order within the city is gradually returning to normal. The American Embassy remains calm as usual. No Americans have been ordered to gather, and based on current indications, personal safety does not seem to be an issue. Street vendors have refused to accept "gold yuan" currency.

Another source from Xiaguan reports: Fighting ceased at 10:00 AM, with only the rearguard troops of the National Army occasionally firing shells at the Communist army in Pukou to cover the National Army's retreat, but the Communist army is not retaliating.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 23rd, 12:30 AM Urgent Telegraph] The National Army began a full-scale withdrawal on the 23rd from the Yangtze River area, stretching approximately 450 miles from Jiujiang in the west to the mouth of the Yangtze River in the east. According to news arriving in Nanjing this afternoon, all riverside ports have been evacuated, and all National Army troops have withdrawn to Hangzhou and other South China areas. As of the time of this dispatch, Nanjing has become a military no-man's land. A portion of the 45th Army, which was covering the retreat of government agencies, has also left the city, while the Communist army has not yet crossed the river from Pukou.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 23rd] The Communist Army Headquarters telegraphed here at 12:30 PM on the 23rd, stating: The Communist Army will begin crossing the river at 7:00 AM on the morning of the 24th. Political envoys have arrived here and notified the Bank of China and various government agencies to begin taking over on the 24th.

[United Press, Local Dispatch, 23rd] Central Air Transport Corporation pilot Ma Jun circled Nanjing three times at an altitude of 500 feet. According to his report, Nanjing Station and the area along the river outside the city are engulfed in flames, and trains are burning. There is one government warship patrolling in the river; others have either been scuttled or are burning, but no artillery fire or sounds of artillery have been seen. Most of the damage is the work of the National Army's demolition squads. All Air Force planes have left Nanjing. About 75 miles from the capital, there are twenty government warships, three of which are on fire. According to another pilot, Sha Di, the road from Nanjing to the south for over 200 miles is filled with refugees. This morning, black smoke rose like clouds in the northern part of Nanjing.

The police have also left, so Wuxi is now a vacuum. It is reported that the vanguard of the Communist army has reached the outskirts.

[This Newspaper, Wuxi, 23rd] This morning, business here was as usual. At noon, rumors spread that the city would be under martial law, so people were uneasy and shops closed, creating a wartime scene.

[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 23rd] Order in Wuxi is still stable, and newspapers are still being published as usual. The troops have withdrawn, and the Industry and Commerce Self-Defense Corps is maintaining security. Machine gun and artillery fire can be heard in Wuxi.

### Premier He Orders Localities to Strictly Guard Against Petty Criminals Causing Trouble

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 23rd] Premier He Yingqin telegraphed all local governments and security agencies on the 21st to intensify the maintenance of social order and security, and strictly guard against petty criminals causing trouble. The provincial government received the telegram yesterday. The original text stated: "In order to eliminate the scourge of war and realize peace, all measures taken since the beginning of this year have been in accordance with the national people's desire for peace, taking the highest interests of the country and people as the premise, seeking compromise and diligently striving for peace. However, the Communist Party has continued to attack even during the peace talks, and the proposed peace agreement is similar to an instrument of surrender and is subject to a deadline for reply, which is even more like an ultimatum. The original document was disclosed in the newspapers, and the military and civilians are deeply indignant. The government telegraphed the delegation to inform the Communist Party, hoping that it would confirm the principle that the people's interests are higher than everything else, reconsider the basic spirit and content of the agreement, and hope to establish a temporary truce agreement as soon as possible to show the sincerity of both parties in seeking true peace. However, Mao Zedong and Zhu De, because the government refused to accept humiliating conditions, have issued an order to the Communist army to launch a full-scale offensive against the government area. The Communist Party is exhausting its military might and is hostile to the nation and the people, which is deeply hateful. At this time, all local security and social order must be intensified and strictly guarded against petty criminals taking the opportunity to cause trouble. In areas where martial law has already been implemented, the martial law should be re-announced and strictly enforced."

### Guangzhou Implements Martial Law

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 23rd] This city began implementing martial law on the 23rd. A curfew will be in effect from 11:00 PM to 6:00 AM the following morning, but ships and trains can still enter and leave the port.

### Communist Army Plans to Isolate Shanghai; Intends to Take a Route Through Southern Anhui, Invade Western Zhejiang, and Eye Hangzhou; Communist Army in Anhui Continues to Cross the River and Capture Wuhu

[Reuters, Nanjing, 23rd] Following the lightning collapse of Nanjing and the entire Yangtze River defense line, the Communist army vanguard is accelerating its advance south and east in an attempt to isolate Shanghai. After capturing several cities, their vanguard is now only fifty miles from Suzhou. If they continue to advance southeast, they can reach Jiaxing in just two hundred miles, cutting off Shanghai's land connection to the outside world. The Communist army that landed near Wuhu has advanced to the vicinity of Xuancheng. Wuhu was lost this morning. Another Communist army force, after crossing the river near Anqing, is also advancing southeast, seemingly intending to take a route through southern Anhui, invade western Zhejiang, and capture Hangzhou. The Communist army participating in the river-crossing campaign, Chen Yi's Second Field Army, is advancing east. In addition, there are 200,000 to 300,000 National Army troops of Liu Bocheng's Third Field Army, who crossed the river south of Wuhu. If they can quickly escape the Communist army's encirclement, it is expected that they will retreat to a line of defense at Ningbo, Hangzhou, and Nanchang. The overall retreat of the National Army along the Yangtze River is likely the result of yesterday's meeting in Hangzhou. Military observers predict that the Communist army may temporarily refrain from taking Shanghai and instead directly attack the line of Nanchang, Hangzhou, and Ningbo. The attack on Shanghai may not occur until the Communist army is able to establish a supply line downstream of the Yangtze River. The ability to establish this supply line depends on the extent of the advance of Lin Biao's large army.

[This Newspaper, Nanchang, 23rd] The 360-mile river defense line between Jiujiang and Anqing was breached by the Communist army near Wangjiang Yangwan the night before. The first batch of Communist troops to cross the river numbered about 4,000, followed by a second batch of 8,000. Currently, the river defense troops between Hukou and Dongliu have withdrawn, and their whereabouts are unknown. The Pengze County government is also moving with the garrison. There are no National Army troops in Pengze and the areas to the east. The river defense between Hukou and Jiujiang is now being defended by troops dispatched by the Eighth Pacification District. The Hukou County government is still working in the city. The administrative meeting convened by the provincial government ended early last night. The county magistrates along the river left the province by car this morning. Telephones in Nanchang and Pengze are normal, but communications between Xunyang and Nanjing were once interrupted.

[This Newspaper Dispatch] According to reliable sources, the first batch of Communist troops to cross the river was 6,000 men from Liu Bocheng's command, who crossed the river south of Guanzhou, 15 kilometers southwest of Anqing, before dawn on the 19th. Chen Yi's command followed closely behind, landing at Digang with 30,000 men at 3:00 AM on the 20th. At 6:00 AM on the 20th, Air Force planes arrived over the Digang River and discovered about 3,000 large and small ships crossing the river, densely packed and stretching across the river. Subsequently, the Communist army that landed at Jiangyin approached the Jiangyin Fortress on the morning of the 21st, and the fortress commander, Dai Rongguang, immediately led his troops to welcome them with white flags. On the night of the 21st, the Communist army landed near Zhenjiang. On the 22nd, the Communist army landed at Caishiji. On the morning of the 23rd, a small force of Communist troops landed at Yanziyi, 15 miles east of Xiaguan in Nanjing. By this point, Chen Yi's command controlled the bridgehead positions on the south bank in five sections from Digang to Jiangyin. The Communist troops invading in the Digang and Jiangyin sections penetrated deep into Fanchang and approached Wuxi, respectively. On the north bank of the Yangtze River above Anqing, it is reported that Liu Bocheng's command of the Communist army also has 10,000 ships, which have crossed the river in sections with tens of thousands of Communist troops. This batch of Communist troops is using Zhide as a starting point to penetrate deep into the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway line in Jiangxi province. Their intention is clearly to cut off the main forces of the National Army in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou from the passages to Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, and other provinces, in order to engage in a decisive battle with the main forces of the National Army in the Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou areas.

[This Newspaper, Huangpi, 23rd] Military News: Most of Lin Biao's troops east of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, south of Changxuanling, have moved east. There is only one regiment of the Communist army in that area. Currently, there are no large groups of the Communist army within forty miles north of Huangpi.

### Capital Strategically Evacuated; National Army Resolves to Continue the Struggle; Government Spokesman Issues Statement Yesterday

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] The government spokesman issued a statement on the National Army's withdrawal from the capital, stating: "The Communist Party took advantage of the government's final appeal for peace and a truce to launch a general offensive and cross the Yangtze River south on a large scale, causing Digang, Jiangyin, Yangzhong, and other places to be abandoned one after another, and the capital fell into a pincer-shaped offensive. Our troops stationed in the capital were in a passive position for a time and unable to exert their full combat power. Our commander-in-chief, assessing the situation, believes that the current stage is not suitable for a decisive resolution. We had no choice but to automatically carry out a strategic withdrawal from the capital. Moreover, the government had already moved to Guangzhou earlier, and the headquarters is properly settled. All offices left by government agencies in Nanjing will be closed and return to the birthplace of our revolution to continue the struggle for the independence of the country and the freedom of the people. The reason why the Communist Party used violence to end the peace talks and expand the war is due to its consistent international conspiracy to sell out the country and the nation and enslave the people of the whole country. Observing the direction of people's hearts around the world, the great struggle for democracy and freedom will eventually be victorious. It is by no means possible for the Communist Party's temporary and local military adventures to reverse its final fate. The government is convinced that all compatriots and all officers and soldiers, recalling the difficulties in building the Republic of China and grieving over the fact that the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum has suffered another catastrophe, will act with a heavy heart, a spirit of great fearlessness, loyalty, courage, and dedication to make the most arduous struggle for the country and the people, and strive for the personality and final victory of our revolutionary people and revolutionary soldiers. The final victory will belong to patriots and not to traitors, and it will belong to proponents of democracy and freedom, not to proponents of dictatorship and violence. This can be asserted."

### Seeking a Thorough Resolution to the Land Problem

— Xiao Zheng

In our founding declaration, we loudly proclaimed: "We clearly see that tomorrow's China will be a unified, democratic, and progressive nation on its own territory; and in the world, it will be an advancing, constructive, and glorious nation." We also appealed: "Compatriots across the country, regardless of profession, class, party, or gender, must awaken and organize together to seek a thorough resolution to the land problem and realize the new China we wish to see."

We land reformers have always firmly believed that the cruel wars of mankind are due to the lack of a perfect land system, sufficient to allow mankind to live peacefully and work together to overcome nature and create civilization. Mankind has gone astray, believing that war can solve survival problems, hence the tragic history of mankind's mutual slaughter for thousands of years. The highest belief of us land reformers is to reform the land system by peaceful means, create an environment suitable for survival, and fundamentally eliminate the concept of human mutual struggle. Therefore, we firmly believe that the solution to all social problems must be based on "social justice" and "personal freedom." Only reforms based on "social justice" and "personal freedom" are truly genuine and reasonable reforms that can lead to kind human cooperation and create a brand new history for mankind.

Based on this basic belief, we have been calling for the reform of China's land system for eighteen years—from the China Land Problem Research Association and the Land Administration Society in 1932 to today's China Land Reform Association. We deeply understand that China's land problem is the main cause of the problem of governance and chaos in Chinese dynasties. We have painstakingly advised the government to show sincerity and courage to solve the land issue. However, the speaker speaks earnestly, but the listener scorns. Until last autumn, our last and low-demand farmland reform bill was still discriminated against and shelved by the government and the Legislative Yuan. The ruling party lacked the determination and courage to solve the people's most pressing survival problem—the land problem. Its failure today is inevitable and not accidental. Today, the central and some provincial and municipal government authorities also know that they should take land reform as a mere slogan, but they still lack the sincerity to take action. Their failure will obviously continue or become more thorough. On the other hand, our call for land reform has not been truly accepted by the general intellectuals and opposition parties in society. Sometimes, although land reform is listed as a political program, they emphasize using it as a tool for political struggle rather than as a real policy for solving people's problems.

We believe that China's economic foundation today is still within the scope of the agricultural economy. Land is the foundation of survival for the majority of people. If the land exploitation system—the landlord system—is still allowed to exist, then only a small number of people—the landlord class—will have enough food and clothing, and the majority will only live on the starvation line. This is a great violation of "social justice." At the same time, in a society based on an agricultural economy, land is still a tool to guarantee the freedom of life for the majority of farmers. If farmers are deprived of their land, they will lose the guarantee of "personal freedom." Therefore, we believe that the "farmland to the tiller" policy is indeed an excellent policy established on the dual foundations of "social justice" and "personal freedom," and all parties must deeply understand it, list it as a common political program, and implement it effectively.

At the same time, natural resources are a treasure house given to all mankind by nature and should not be occupied and plundered by a small number of people under any name. The value of urban land is the result of the common civilization of human society and should not be cleverly seized by urban parasites—urban real estate operators. We believe that everyone should have an appropriate place to live. Therefore, we also advocate that every family should have a suitable unit of housing and land. These should be common proposals for solving the people's survival problem. We hope that those who seek the country's welfare will no longer be biased by standing on a certain class.

China's suffering is enough. Now, powerful parties and prestigious social leaders should all show sincerity and consider the country and the people. They must eliminate all private opinions and completely seek national affairs based on the two major foundations of "social justice" and "personal freedom." All political, economic, and social problems must be used as a yardstick to measure whether various reforms meet these two major requirements. If only "social justice" is taken into account without considering "personal freedom," this will stifle social civilization and hinder human evolution; this is "false equality." If only "personal freedom" is taken into account without considering "social justice," this will promote social unrest and hinder the welfare of the masses; this is "false freedom." If these two foundations cannot be considered simultaneously, they are not true reforms or permanent welfare. If peace is accidentally obtained in this way, it is also "false peace." Social evolution and turmoil will still follow. We hope that those who seek the country's welfare will not make mistakes again in the future.

If they can discuss all practical problems based on these two major foundations, they can be solved easily. All the problems in the world, if we can jointly respect "justice" and mutually respect "freedom," we can achieve a consistent and permanent truth. We need a political system, an economic system, and a social system that conforms to "social justice" and "personal freedom." We hope that the authorities responsible for solving national problems will pay attention to this.

At the same time, we ask all members of society to make this appeal together and to jointly supervise the progress in the future. Whoever violates this principle is not truly seeking permanent welfare and peace for the country and the people.

The eyes of the people are discerning. We are waiting to see!

### Hu Shih Tells Reporters in the United States: I Can Eventually Obtain U.S. Aid - Government Decides to Maintain Free China and Recover Lost Territory

[Central News Agency San Francisco, 22nd Dispatch] Hu Shih stated at a reception for Chinese and American reporters on the morning of the 22nd: He firmly believes that Acheson's recent letter on the China policy issue does not fundamentally close the door to future aid to the Chinese government in spirit. Hu Shih made this statement in response to a reporter's question. He said: After studying the full text of Acheson's letter on the President Cleveland ship, I believe that two points are inevitable: (1) The U.S. government and people are both anti-communist and determined to oppose the expansion of communist totalitarianism everywhere; (2) Countries that can resist the expansion and tyranny of communist totalitarianism will be able to obtain U.S. aid. I believe that if the Chinese government proves its ability to resist communism, then U.S. aid will come without being requested. In other words, China will be able to obtain this aid. I know Acheson as a person and know that he really sympathizes with China. As for the general situation in China, Hu Shih said: The Chinese government's rejection of the communist conditions is very important to the world, because accepting the conditions is equivalent to 400 million Chinese people surrendering to communism. The lessons of Eastern European countries have made the Chinese government understand that a coalition government completely controlled by the communists is equivalent to complete surrender. He believes that the government will try its best to maintain a free China in the largest possible area and recover as much lost territory as possible. The government under the leadership of Acting President Li will continue to receive the support of President Chiang and the people. A reporter asked whether the Chinese government can mobilize the people of free China to continue to resist. Hu Shih said: The government has several advantages. The communists have shown the people of free China that life under communist rule is unbearable for ordinary people. The current life in North China is clear proof of this. The government still has a good navy and a strong air force, which, if used properly, will be a powerful reliance to prevent the communists from entering southern China. After arriving here yesterday morning, Mr. Hu was very hospitable. University of California President Sproul held an afternoon tea party. The university faculty association will host a banquet for Mr. Hu this noon. San Francisco Chronicle editor Smith will host a dinner tomorrow night. On the 25th, Stanford University President Sterling will host a reception.

He was surrounded by the crowd and finally rescued by the police and hid in a house. The naval city of Dartmouth is the location of the British Naval University and is in a state of emotional turmoil due to the British warship being shelled. When Pollitt asked why the "Amethyst" warship was sailing upstream on the Yangtze River, one person rushed forward and threw a rope and a note to Pollitt, forcing him to commit suicide. The note read: "Judas (the traitor who betrayed Christ) received this kind of rope in the beginning. I ask you to do the same. Ankhorst White, the father of a sailor killed in the Yangtze River."

It was not until the 22nd that it was learned that a total of four of the above ships were British warships. In the course of fighting with the above warships, the People's Liberation Army suffered 252 casualties, and part of the positions and weapons were destroyed.

Police and city officials invited representatives from all sectors yesterday to discuss the implementation of the Shanghai Defense War, hoping to gain understanding of the authorities' difficulties and seeking suggestions. Gu Zhenggang, Yan Huiqing, and others attended and delivered speeches. [Report from this newspaper] Commander of the Songhu Garrison Chen Daqing and Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Chen Liang, in light of the Communist army's brazen attack and the entry of Nanjing and Shanghai into a state of war, announced important wartime regulations and discussed various wartime measures to maintain public order. They specially invited leaders from the city's party, government, and military, legal entities, schools, business and industry, and the press to a discussion meeting at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 9:00 AM yesterday. Attendees included: Yan Huiqing, Gu Zhenggang, Liu Hongsheng, Song Hanzhang, Pan Gongzhan, Gu Yuquan, Qin Runqing, Xu Xiaoyan, Li Zhaobao, Yu Bingjian, Cheng Cangbo, Guo Yunguan, Zha Liangjian, Hu Jianzhong, Wang Zhizhuo, Li Shouyong, Diao Peiran, Huang Zhuoqiu, Fan Zhengbo, Cao Gubing, Pan Shihao, Zhang Zige, Wang Zhuyi, Zheng Lianqi, Gao Fang, Cao Yinzhi, Tao Yishan, Zhang Yongnian, Liu Jingyi, Wang Zhaohuai, Wang Xianqing, and Li Tanliang, among over a hundred others. Commander Chen presided over the meeting. Chen, with a heavy and indignant heart, reported on the current military situation from the perspective of a military leader, stating that the Communist Party deliberately sabotaged peace talks by presenting eight demands in twenty-four harsh conditions. Zhu De and Mao Zedong have ordered a general offensive, and the military situation on the front lines is urgent, with full-scale operations resuming. There is no doubt that Shanghai is an important base from military, economic, and cultural perspectives. Following government instructions and central decisions, Shanghai must be defended to fight for the people's freedom and national independence. He solemnly announced that Shanghai has fully entered a state of war. The Communist Party's so-called eight demands in twenty-four conditions are even more cruel than the actions of the Japanese, with a tyranny and terror that makes it impossible to be a good citizen. The question of whether the people's freedom will be guaranteed in the future is becoming a serious issue. Our defense war is a forced one. Chen reported on the situation along the Yangtze River defense line, stating that some Communist troops have already crossed the river, and the military authorities are mobilizing troops to suppress them. To successfully complete the Shanghai Defense War, ensure social security, strengthen public order, stabilize finance, and maintain transportation, it is necessary to implement military control, which is a common need. During this period of military operations, to ensure local security in Shanghai, any illegal activities such as sabotage and spreading rumors will be punished with the most severe military law. He hopes that all sectors understand the authorities' difficult position and that local authorities will provide valuable suggestions as much as possible, and that the military and civilians will unite to implement the Shanghai Defense War and fulfill our mission. Raise the awareness of all sectors and hope for three efforts Subsequently, Gu Zhenggang delivered a speech, stating that Commander Chen's report on the defense of Shanghai and the situation of the Communist Party's talks was very thorough. At this time of great change, he is very willing to meet with everyone to seek advice and, as a member of the nation, with twelve thousand points of enthusiasm, is determined to follow Commander Chen and the leaders of this city to fight together. Fighting requires determination, and with determination, there is strength, and first, there must be a basic understanding and concept, and then final victory will be assured. His basic understanding of the war is: (1) an anti-aggression war, (2) an anti-totalitarian war, and (3) an anti-surrender war. To protect the original social and family system traditions, to stop the violent aggression of the Communist International, to fight for the people's survival and freedom, and to maintain thousands of years of inherent culture, we have no choice but to fight for self-defense and for national independence. Gu acknowledged the various factors of the Kuomintang's past failures but denied that it was the Communist Party's success. The Kuomintang has since deeply regretted its past mistakes and decided on three major policies: (1) unite patriotic people within the country, (2) unite leaders of democratic and free parties within the country, and (3) unite anti-aggression countries and nations in the world to fight together. Final victory will surely belong to us. Gu also, with an extremely firm and sincere attitude, raised the awareness of all sectors in the city, hoping that: (1) we will strive to win the survival of the nation, (2) we can protect property only by going bankrupt, and (3) we can protect life only by risking it. We will support this anti-aggression war with all human, material, and financial resources. Believe that in the shortest time there is still a mediation method Yan Huiqing said in his speech: I feel ashamed that I have not been able to make a great contribution to this KMT-CPC peace negotiation. The peace talks officially started on April 1, and I finally hoped to achieve a peaceful solution. It is a pity that they are on the verge of breaking down within three weeks. Now that the Communist army has crossed the Yangtze River, the national army has to deal with it, and all Chinese people should obey the measures of the military authorities. However, I still hope that in the short term, or after a month, there will be another opportunity to reopen peace talks. We must know that we cannot overcome everything by force alone. I believe that the Communist Party will not ignore the people's desire for peace and ignore China's inherent culture and morality, and there will still be mediation methods in the end. Firmly believe that the government's decision will be fully supported by the people Pan Gongzhan said in his speech: After the Communist Party proposed eight items and twenty-four clauses to the government, the Communist Party's face has been completely revealed. In the so-called people's coalition government, in addition to the Communist Party occupying the majority of seats, other parties must be appointed by the Communist Party, which is known to be manipulated. Mao Zedong's statement on the Atlantic Charter that in the event of a third world war, he would fight together with the Soviet Union is intended to throw the entire Chinese people into the arms of the Soviet Union and sacrifice and fight for Soviet communism. It is found that the harsh conditions proposed by the Communist Party should not only be resolutely rejected by the government, but also unanimously demanded by the people. At present, the opinions of all parties in Nanjing and Guangzhou are that the Communist Party's advance and the destruction of the peace talks have made the internal unity completely strong in the face of a major enemy. It is firmly believed that the government's decision will be fully supported by the people. It is also firmly believed that Shanghai will become a strong fortress and a beacon of freedom in the Far East. If Shanghai can stand firm, the world situation will be changed. We should use the spirit of the people of Shanghai to inspire the morale of the soldiers on the front lines. Pan believes that since Shanghai has been declared in a state of war, it is urgent to eliminate spies, and he asks the military authorities to strengthen vigilance and attention. Maintain order in the rear and pay attention to finance and economy Xu Jiyi said in his speech: Since the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, Shanghai has been in constant turmoil, but none is as serious as the current situation. This era is by no means comparable to the situation thirty-eight years ago. Our minimum requirement is security, and we hope that business and industry will contribute money and effort to fully support the military and political authorities' emergency measures. Secondly, Cheng Cangbo, representing the press, said that in order to defend freedom and for the safety of life, the attitude of the press is very firm, and the Communist Party cannot coexist. Cheng also suggested that the military authorities appoint a person in charge to regularly release correct military news, maintain order in the rear, and pay more attention to finance and economy. The central government should quickly set up a method to cooperate with the military operations. Subsequently, Zhang Yi, President of Fudan University, and Yi Min of the Literary and Cultural Association spoke one after another. Commander Chen briefly answered various active suggestions, and the meeting adjourned at about 11:00 AM. Finance Minister Liu arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and had frequent contact with various sectors. Finance Minister and Governor of the National Bank Liu Gongyun arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. At 8:30 AM, he went to the National Bank to handle official business, and then went to the Bank of China Building to attend the routine meeting of the Exchange Equalization Fund. After the meeting, Liu met with Minister of Transportation Duanmu Jie at the National Bank to discuss the Ministry of Transportation's funding issues. In the afternoon, Liu had frequent contact with financial leaders in Shanghai. After 5:00 PM, he convened a meeting of the heads of various bureaus and departments of the bank at the National Bank. It is reported that the discussion focused on how to cooperate with the current business as various institutions in Nanjing withdraw to Shanghai. In addition, in order to adapt to the current situation, the National Bank will work as usual on its regular weekly holiday today, but will not conduct business externally. The general situation is tense, and the number of passengers on the South China airlines has quadrupled. China Airlines has now stopped accepting reservations. [Report from this newspaper] The general situation is tense, and the number of people ordering airline tickets to Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Taiwan, Fuzhou, and other places has soared in recent days. In the past two days, it is estimated that more than 3,000 people have quadrupled compared to usual. China Airlines has now stopped accepting reservations for its South China routes. Although China Airlines still accepts reservations, tickets for routes to Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Taiwan have been registered until the middle of next month. The Bureau of Public Works is re-demarcating factory, warehouse, and residential areas. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works, in view of the fact that the Yangshupu District of this city is an important industrial area, originally formulated construction area planning rules to implement, but currently, it is difficult to implement due to the economic environment. It has now decided to study in detail with reference to the opinions of all parties and re-demarcate the original regulations for factory areas, warehouse areas, and the second and third residential areas. In addition, the boundary lines of the South Shanghai District construction area have also been revised to add the third residential area and the factory area according to the factory situation. It is heard that the above plan has been approved by the Municipal Government Conference and will be submitted to the Ninth Municipal Council for deliberation. After its passage, it will be announced and implemented and submitted to the Executive Yuan for record. The municipal government will issue salaries tomorrow, and all 40 billion yuan will be in cash. [Report from this newspaper] The municipal government, in view of the increasingly tense situation, decided to issue this month's salaries in advance tomorrow (the 25th) in accordance with 162 billion yuan in order to stabilize the lives of its employees and improve work efficiency. The remainder will be reissued after the publication of the cost of living index for public and private school teachers at the end of the month. According to the person in charge of the Finance Bureau, the total amount of the above salaries requires approximately 40 billion yuan, which was obtained from loans from the Central Bank. After days of hard work by the Finance Bureau, the funds have been fully raised and are all in cash. All of them can be issued tomorrow. In order to rush the loan procedures, the Finance Bureau will still work as usual on Sunday today. Housing donation and municipal construction donation are calculated according to the cost of living index. The Finance and Land Administration Group of the Council held a joint meeting yesterday. [Report from this newspaper] The Finance and Land Administration Subcommittee of the Council held a joint meeting at the Council at 4:00 PM yesterday. The meeting was chaired by Councilor He Yuanming, and Councilors Jiang Hao, Zhang Zhongyuan, Zhu Fuju, Li Wenjie, Qu Yue, and others attended, totaling more than 30 people. The resolutions discussed are as follows: (1) Method for calculating housing donation and municipal construction donation: After review, it was approved that 1 the total value of the houses and their donation rates (ie, 14 per mille for commercial use and 8 per mille for residential use) originally approved by the Municipal Council for housing construction donation remain unchanged. However, each Li (month) and the donation amount payable by each household have been fixed. Therefore, in the future, the two donations for housing construction will use the original donation amount as the base for donation collection, and then adjust it according to the cost of living index for the lower period of the month before each quarter (month) to obtain the housing donation and municipal construction donation payable for each quarter (month) in the future. 2 Although the housing donation and municipal construction donation are adjusted according to the index, if they are still collected quarterly, it will be very difficult to use one-time income for three months' dispatching due to the rapid devaluation of currency. Then the so-called adjustment is still nominal. Therefore, in the future, the collection of housing construction donations will be handled on a monthly basis. If it is too late to handle it this quarter, it can be combined for two months to be able to respond on a monthly basis. 3 The spring housing construction donation for this year has not yet been collected. Now, in accordance with the foregoing adjustment method, the entire quarter will be supplemented according to the cost of living index for the lower period of April, and will be handled at the same time as April or April and May to save procedures and benefit library revenue. (2) Review opinion on the method for collecting gasoline sales donations in this city: Reserved. The next period of land price tax will also be adjusted according to the index (3) Regarding the adjustment of the tax amount according to the price index for the next period of land price tax in this year, the method is: (1) Tax amount: It is proposed to multiply the tax amount for the first period of this year by the ratio difference between December 15, 1937 (ie, the date of announcement of the standard land price in 1938) and the price index 15 days before the collection (using the price total index compiled by the Central Bank) as the tax amount for the next period. (2) Time limit: The payment must be completed within 15 days after the notice is given, and a surcharge will be imposed according to regulations for exceeding the time limit (the date of collection will be determined separately). (3) Penalties: Those who pay taxes after the deadline will be fined (at a rate of 2% per month, and less than one month will be counted as one month) based on the original tax amount. From the date of exceeding the deadline, the adjustment will be made according to the price index. Those who pay taxes in the first ten days of the month will be adjusted according to the index on the 25th of the previous month, those who pay taxes in the middle ten days of the month will be adjusted according to the index on the 5th of this month, and those who pay taxes in the last ten days of the month will be adjusted according to the index on the 15th of this month. (4) In order to avoid repeated penalties, the method of adding a collection fee that was originally implemented in this city will be abolished. Review opinion: Pass. The price index will be changed to the cost of living index. (4) Proposal submitted by the mayor: Those who are slow in paying taxes shall be levied according to the price index on the day multiplied by the original tax amount, in addition to the penalties imposed according to other penalty rules. Review result: The price index in the original case was changed to the cost of living index, and it was stipulated that those who exceed the time limit by one day will increase by 5%, and those who exceed the time limit more will adopt a progressive system, increasing the proportion. The ninth general assembly of the council will be postponed. [Report from this newspaper] The ninth general assembly of the Municipal Council, which was originally scheduled to be held from the 25th of this month, has been postponed according to the opinions of the majority of councilors.

[Report from this newspaper] The Public Utilities Subcommittee of the Council held a meeting yesterday to discuss the pricing methods for various public utilities in this city. It was resolved that: (1) The city government should maintain public utilities, not provide them, and handle them at its discretion within the principles of taking into account the affordability of citizens, especially regarding the base number, it should be carefully reviewed and tried out for one month during the extended meeting of the ninth general assembly of the council. (2) Regarding emergency matters, the city government should negotiate with the Central Bank to assist as much as possible so that public utilities are not forced to interrupt due to lack of fuel, equipment, and funds during this extraordinary period. Passenger and freight transport on all shipping lines will be adjusted from the 25th. All will increase by 220%. The Shipping Association and the Shanghai Shipping Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday and resolved the following major issues: (1) It was decided that from the 25th, the freight rates for passengers and freight on all lines will be increased by 220% based on the original price, and the export freight from Taiwan Province will be increased by 10% based on the original price.

### Strengthening Defenses, Preparing for War, and Enhancing Security: Sichuan Province Adopts Emergency Measures to Ban Strikes and Complete the Overall Suppression

[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 23rd] To strengthen defenses and prepare for war, the Sichuan Provincial Government has adopted emergency measures to ban strikes by workers, teachers, and students, thoroughly eliminate espionage elements, complete the overall suppression of remaining bandits throughout Sichuan, comprehensively control commodity prices, and implement special inspections. Furthermore, to strengthen security in Chengdu, the 4th, 5th, and 9th Security Regiments, along with the 95th Army, have been deployed to garrison the city.

[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 23rd] The Sichuan Provincial Government, acting on orders to prepare for war, is urgently rushing to repair the Diguang, Wankai, and Liangxuan three highways of the Daba Mountain national defense line. On the 23rd, an urgent order was issued to conscript one million laborers from the counties along the route to work day and night, aiming to complete the repairs before the rainy season.

### A Military Officer from Hunan, Having Just Returned from Beiping, Discusses the Situation There: Many Students Conscripted into Military Service

[Our Changsha Dispatch, 23rd] A Major military officer from Hunan, recently returned from Beiping, stated that he remained in Beiping for four months after the partial peace agreement. According to him, the situation in Beiping has completely changed since the Communists entered the city. High-ranking Communist officials dress in old and tattered clothes, resembling cooks, but each is accompanied by numerous guards. The clothing of ordinary citizens is also extremely simple, with young men and women wearing homespun and old clothes. Wealthier individuals, to avoid revealing their identities, are going to great lengths to appear impoverished. All universities have admitted young soldiers from the Communist army, while the original students have been conscripted into military service, following the army southward, purportedly to govern after the liberation of Jiangnan. Moreover, as most of the farmland in the countryside is barren, a system of rationing grain based on population has been implemented, with each person receiving only a meager allocation of sorghum that is not enough to satisfy hunger. Even vegetables are subject to control, making life unimaginably difficult. Shops remain open as usual, but business is slow, with no one interested in luxury goods. There is absolutely no freedom of speech, and newspapers only publish official reports. Since the Communists entered Beiping, they have never publicly executed anyone, but there have been numerous disappearances. In the concentration camp where he resided, there were 10,000 Nationalist soldiers and officers. Due to insufficient sorghum rations, they collectively protested, demanding improvements. Management personnel informed them that they could elect representatives to present their demands. Representatives were immediately chosen, but after they left, they never returned to the camp. Rumors of the Communists providing wives are untrue. While no public trials or struggles have been observed, the Communist policy of gender equality requires everyone to work. It is common for wives to be assigned to work in factories in one location, while husbands are transferred to another, effectively separating couples. City houses, although dilapidated, are no longer being repaired, and no citizens are building new homes. Many professors in Beiping's universities, who were once considered "democratic figures," are now silent. He had not had a haircut during his four months in Beiping, and his face was covered in beard. He shook his head and sighed repeatedly at the slogans plastered all over Changsha, suggesting that those who put up the slogans should first go and see Beiping. He repeatedly stated and swore that he had no political stance and that his words were not intended as propaganda. If he fabricated even half a sentence, he would be struck by lightning. He has decided never to travel abroad again, and will retire to his hometown and be a farmer for the rest of his life. Finally, he stated that the Communist resources are dwindling, and a quick resolution is advisable. If the Nationalist Party could thoroughly correct its past mistakes, genuinely implement the Three Principles of the People, and unite in purpose to win back the hearts of the people, it might not be too late to salvage the situation.

### French Foreign Minister Schuman Firmly States: Germany Will Not Be Allowed to Re-arm; The Three Western Powers Are Willing to Resume Negotiations with the Soviets, Insisting on the Lifting of the Berlin Blockade as a Condition

[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] French Foreign Minister Schuman stated at a press conference today that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are consistently prepared to resume Four Power meetings and talks with the Soviets immediately after the lifting of the Berlin Blockade. However, he also stated that the resolutions regarding West Germany decided by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France at the London Conference in June last year and recently in Washington will continue to be implemented, regardless of whether or not there are Four Power meetings. However, if the Soviet Union is prepared to agree to proposals acceptable to the three Western powers, the measures regarding West Germany agreed upon by the three powers may also be modified. Schuman also assured that Germany will never be re-armed, nor will it be a member of the Atlantic Pact, because joining the Atlantic Pact requires being an armed nation.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd] After attending a cabinet meeting to discuss international issues today, French Foreign Minister Schuman announced to reporters that if the Germans refuse to accept the Bonn Constitution, the Western Allies may take joint action in Germany. As for what action to take, it is too early to say, because although the Social Democrats have been defeated, there is still hope for improvement in the overall situation next week. German agreement to the constitution endorsed by the Allies would allow the new occupation regulations agreed upon in Washington to be implemented, granting Germany greater freedom and greater responsibility in handling affairs. The Germans should know that they are still in a state of defeat and occupation, without a peace treaty or a government. They must accept the transitional stage, and it is a mistake to demand a normal system of governance during this stage. Schuman then answered questions regarding the Soviet Union's probes into lifting the Berlin Blockade and counter-blockade, stating that the French government still believes that the door remains open as before. If the Soviet Union lifts the Berlin Blockade, the Four Power Conference, which stalled in 1947, can be restarted. If the Allied counter-blockade and the Soviet blockade are lifted simultaneously, the situation prior to the end of June 1948 can be restored.

[Agence France-Presse, Bonn, 22nd] The foreign ministers of the three occupying powers of West Germany have notified the Bonn German Parliamentary Council that the three countries cannot agree to the current incorporation of Berlin into the German Federal Republic. The three foreign ministers conveyed this in an informal letter, delivered by the Bonn Allied Liaison Officer to the Chairman of the Council. The letter also stated that all plans proposed by the Council to guarantee the independence of the state governments and the federal government would be considered by the three countries in turn. Any suggestions that guarantee the full rights of the states, making them independent entities within the federation, will also be given appropriate consideration.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson, and South African Prime Minister Malan did not attend.

The Netherlands hopes Indonesia will propose a compromise suggestion

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] According to well-informed sources on the 22nd, the United States greatly hopes that France can achieve a peaceful resolution with Vietnamese nationalists as soon as possible, as this resolution concerns the future of Asia and Europe. French officials have been informed of this sentiment of the United States. It is rumored that the U.S. has promised full support and possible economic aid to Bao Dai's Vietnamese government. However, well-informed sources neither confirm nor deny this information. U.S. officials believe that the rapid downturn in the Chinese situation makes a peaceful resolution in Vietnam even more necessary. Furthermore, the U.S. believes that the war waged by France against Vietnamese nationalists for the past three years has depleted materials and money, hindering France's economic recovery plan. Intelligence officials here say that Bao Dai will leave France for Vietnam "in two or three days."

### Representatives from the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Canada, and Other Countries Unanimously Call for the Defense of Peace; The Paris Peace Conference is Filled with an Anti-War Atmosphere

[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] Canadian representative Endicott told the World Peace Congress here today that the land in northern Canada is currently being prepared as a long-range atomic bomb bombing base to counter the Soviet Union. We share the same shame as Belgium, forced to provide our abundant uranium resources to the mighty Uncle Sam for war and destruction, instead of for the benefit of mankind.

Endicott, who grew up in China and preached there for many years, said that many Canadians understand the importance of developments in China. The British cruiser recently driven out of the Yangtze River by the Chinese People's Liberation Army was actually driven out by American and Canadian weapons. Undoubtedly, when Churchill presents his annual report to the American shareholders of the British Empire again, he will lament that the Marshall Aid plan to China has caused serious losses to British interests in China.

[Associated Press, Paris, 23rd] At today's meeting of the World Peace Congress, the Secretary-General of the African Democratic Association, Da Brazilia, spoke, praising the CCP's "victorious advance" into Nanjing. Madame Leclerc, representative of the French Women's Alliance, spoke, urging France to stop the war in Vietnam. An American Black writer accused the United States of being power-hungry and leading the world into the hell of neo-colonialism. American labor leader Hanson said that the main base of world imperialism is in Washington.

[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] As the Soviet representative addressed the World Peace Congress today, he said that the Soviet people do not want to attack anyone and deeply abhor war. Soviet representative Nicholas stated that the Russian Orthodox Church believes that every Christian has the sacred duty to oppose war by all means. The Orthodox Church believes that the will for peace will ultimately prevail. Madame Zola, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications of Bulgaria, also said that the Bulgarian people also deeply oppose war. Bulgaria is fortunate to have Soviet assistance, which has enabled the government to be taken over by the majority of the people. British representative Hawken pointed out that the youth of the world have been sacrificed to war propaganda. Youth should be the greatest hope of the country, but in half of the world today, youth are being sacrificed. U.S. representative Hanson said, "We will never be easily driven into an anti-Soviet war or sacrifice our lives to Wall Street." Madame Legray, president of the French National Women's Association, firmly stated that if the United States wants the French people to participate in a trial of strength against the Soviet Union, it will ultimately be disappointed. As Joan of Arc said, "You can bind me, but you cannot bind the future of France." The most noteworthy speaker at today's meeting was Madame Cosmedemianskaya, daughter of Madame Zoya, who is regarded by the Soviet people as the French Joan of Arc. Madame Kosmedemianskaya stated: "Our country is engaged in construction work to repair wartime wounds. Our country wants a solid and reasonable peace in the world, but the aggressors are trying to exert all their strength to resist the Soviet Union. The war being prepared by imperialism is not only against the Soviet Union, because this war will destroy millions of peaceful families and plunge them into suffering. I hope that after the delegates return to their countries, they can inform everyone of the criminal intentions of the enemies of mankind, so that the peace-loving masses can unite to defend peace."

### Labor Union Leader Praises Stalin

Speaking at the Soviet Labor Congress

[United Press, Moscow, 22nd] The chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions and secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labour, Di Vittorio, said in an address to the Soviet Labor Congress that the Italian people need peace and friendship with other peoples, especially the Soviet people, because the Soviet people were the first to recognize Italy's value as an independent nation. The reactionary elements in Britain and the United States who are trying to drag mankind into a new war have forgotten that the world's workers need peace, and that the masses in all countries love and yearn for the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union is the guide for all oppressed nations. Di Vittorio also praised Soviet workers and Stalin, saying that the Soviet Union's historical victory is an example for workers in other lands. Every time the Soviet Union achieves another economic victory, it is "our victory and the victory of the world proletariat."
