Full Text of the President's Statement

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] President Chiang Kai-shek issued the following statement on the 21st:

Since I, Chiang Kai-shek, issued a statement on New Year's Day advocating peace, the whole country has responded in unison and supported it unanimously. However, more than ten days have passed, and the war has not yet stopped. The goal of peace cannot be achieved, and the suffering of the people is reaching its limit. Therefore, I have decided to take the lead in retiring, hoping to end the war and relieve the people from suffering. In accordance with Article 49 of the Constitution of the Republic of China, which stipulates that "when the President is unable to perform his duties due to any reason, the Vice President shall act on his behalf," Vice President Li Zongren will assume the presidential powers from the 21st of this month. I hope that the military and civilians of the whole country and governments at all levels will work together with sincerity and support Vice President Li Zongren in unison to promote lasting peace. Throughout my life, I have been engaged in the national revolution and adhered to the Three Principles of the People. Since the Northern Expedition from Guangzhou in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China until the completion of unification, I have always regarded protecting the nation, realizing democracy, and improving the people's livelihood as my duties. At the same time, I believe that only by securing peace can all political and economic improvements have a solid foundation. Therefore, for more than 20 years, I have insisted on fighting the war against Japan to the end. In addition, I have sometimes used force internally only as a last resort, and I have spared no personal sacrifice, making concessions for the sake of the country. The past is clear for all to see. If the Communist Party can realize this, cease fighting and make peace, save the people from suffering, preserve the vitality of the country, ensure the integrity of the territory and sovereignty, prevent the destruction of historical culture and social order, and ensure the people's lives and freedoms, then peace can be achieved under these principles. This is what I, Chiang Kai-shek, sincerely pray for.

Statement of Acting President Li

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Vice President Li Zongren issued the following statement on the 21st, in accordance with the law to exercise presidential powers:

President Chiang Kai-shek is concerned about the difficulties of the nation and the suffering of the people and has resolutely retired to promote the early realization of peace. In accordance with Article 49 of the Constitution of the Republic of China, Zongren will exercise the powers of the President on his behalf. I am aware of my own mediocrity and incompetence and am filled with trepidation at assuming this important task. However, Zongren has followed the President and devoted himself to the revolution for more than 20 years and knows that he has always placed the country and the people first in his dealings with others and in his own conduct. His decisions regarding his own advancement and retreat are always strict, upright, and clear. Once his mind is made up, it cannot be changed. I have received his instruction and cannot refuse the responsibility. I can only work diligently, be loyal to the country, ensure that the central government's affairs do not fall into disarray, and help the President achieve his cause of saving the country and the people. I hope that all our military and civilians will cooperate sincerely, that civil and military officials will remain in their posts, that we will unite with sincerity and work together with one heart, adhere to the policy of peace and national reconstruction, and strive for democracy and freedom. The nation and the people depend on it.

### President Chiang Departs Nanjing for Hangzhou; Will Fly Directly to Taiwan by Special Plane This Morning; Before Departure, Summons Standing Committee Meeting to Read Retirement Statement

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] President Chiang Kai-shek retired and left Nanjing on the 21st, taking the "Meiling" special plane to Hangzhou at 4:10 p.m. The weather in the capital on the 21st was sunny and refreshing, and the temperature was relatively high, a rare warm climate in midwinter. At about 3 p.m., dozens of cars carrying important officials suddenly rushed to the Ming Palace Airport. For a time, officials gathered. The "Meiling" plane was also ready and waiting to depart. The scheduled departure time was 4 p.m. Several important officials were sitting in the auditorium of the Air Transport Brigade waiting. At 4 p.m., two cars carrying the President's attendants drove to the front gate of the airport. The "Meiling" plane suddenly took off without allowing those who came to see him off to catch a glimpse of the President's arrival and boarding. After a while, it was learned that the special plane had flown to the Dajiaochang Airport, where the President changed planes. Only Li Zongren, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Qun, Gu Zhutong, Chen Lifu, and Hong Lanyou met and saw him off at Dajiaochang Airport. The others were too late. The special plane took off at 4:10 p.m. Today, the President was wearing a long robe and mandarin jacket. Before leaving, he showed reluctance for this revolutionary capital at the foot of Zijin Mountain, and many of the people who came to see him off looked sad. Those who accompanied him were Yu Jishi, Chiang Ching-kuo, and Zhejiang Province Chairman Chen Yi also returned to Hangzhou on the plane. Other attendants, such as Secretary Cao Shengfen, took two other special planes.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] President Chiang Kai-shek hoped for the early realization of peace and clearly stated in his New Year's Day message that he would not care about his personal advancement and retreat. In the past three weeks, he has been making various preparations to hand over his powers to Vice President Li Zongren. On the evening of the 19th, when he summoned several important officials, he said that he would leave within a week. However, on the morning of the 21st, the presidents and vice presidents of the five Yuan and more than a dozen important officials received the President's invitation to a luncheon at his Huangpu Road residence at 12 noon. Those present were Li Zongren, Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Tong Guanxian, Liu Jianqun, Yu Youren, Liu Zhe, Wang Chonghui, Jia Jingde, Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Zhongxin, Zhang Qun, and Chen Lifu. The President immediately announced his intention. At 2 p.m., he convened a temporary meeting of the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee at his residence. As the President and concurrently Director-General, he read his retirement statement and repeatedly said: "My departure may be beneficial to the country." He then instructed that after his retirement, the important task of national affairs should be entrusted to Vice President Li and hoped that all parties would assist Vice President Li in completing the task. After the President explained his intention, everyone present was saddened. The country was in such a state that the President had to take the lead in retiring. Almost no one spoke at the meeting. After the meeting, the President announced that he would leave Nanjing at 4 p.m. on the 21st.

[This newspaper, Hangzhou, 21st] President Chiang Kai-shek arrived at Jianqiao Airport by special plane "Meiling" from Nanjing at 6:30 p.m. on the 21st, accompanied by Zhejiang Province Chairman Chen Yi and Chiang Ching-kuo, Yu Jishi and others. Zhejiang Provincial Government Secretary-General Zhang Yanzhe and Air Force School Principal Hu Weike and others went to the airport to welcome them. President Chiang and his party then went to the city and had dinner at Lou Wai Lou. After dinner, Chen Yi returned to the provincial government residence, and the President and others returned to Jianqiao. More than 50 of his entourage who came to Hangzhou stayed at the Jianqiao Air Force Officer School, No. 49 Yingbai Road, and the Dahua Hotel. It is reported that President Chiang will fly directly to Taiwan by special plane on the morning of the 22nd and may go to South China.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Air Force Headquarters learned: The President's special plane "Meiling" landed safely at Hangzhou Jianqiao Airport at 5:40 p.m. on the 21st. Chen Cheng's No. 280 special plane, which took off from Taipei, also landed five minutes after the "Meiling" plane.

### President of the Legislative Yuan Cables Provinces and Cities, Hoping for Adherence to Posts, Defense of the Nation, and Realization of Peace; Cabinet Resignation Earnestly Retained

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Sun Ke cabinet, appointed by President Chiang Kai-shek, submitted a general resignation to Acting President Li on the evening of the 21st. This move was made because President Chiang retired and left Nanjing, and his powers were exercised by Vice President Li. The current cabinet is a responsible cabinet and is related to the issue of trust, so this decision was made. However, before new candidates are nominated, they will continue to be responsible. On the afternoon of the 21st, all cabinet members saw President Chiang off at the airport. After returning to the Executive Yuan, they held a temporary administrative meeting. At the meeting, President Sun Ke first reported on President Chiang's departure from Nanjing, followed by a discussion on the general resignation of the Executive Yuan. Some members believed that the general resignation was in accordance with the law, but given the current extraordinary situation, in order to stabilize social order and people's hearts, they should also express that they would continue to be responsible before the new cabinet nominees of Acting President Li were proposed. This was subsequently agreed upon by a majority of the people. In addition, some people believed that if any cabinet member expressed the need to resign immediately, it could be considered separately. It was unanimously passed immediately and it was decided to notify all provincial and municipal governments to continue to be responsible before the new cabinet nominees were proposed.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] President of the Executive Yuan Sun Ke sent a telegram to the provincial and municipal governments, pacification commissioners' offices, and general headquarters, hoping that they would adhere to their posts and be loyal. The original telegram is as follows:

To the provincial and municipal governments, pacification commissioners' offices, and general headquarters, it is known that President Chiang Kai-shek, in order to respect the wishes of the people of the whole country, seek the early realization of peace, relieve the suffering of the people, and protect the vitality of the country, has handed over the presidential powers to Vice President Li in accordance with the Constitution on the 21st of this month. I and others were ordered to form a cabinet and should be responsible to the President and the Legislative Yuan in accordance with the law. Therefore, we have decided to jointly request resignation and have been ordered to uphold righteousness and earnestly retained. At this time of national crisis and widespread hardship, how dare we not exhaust our efforts and drive forward. We hope that all levels of government, all military and civilians, will uphold the great benevolence and courage of President Chiang Kai-shek, the utmost concern for the country and the people, adhere to their posts, and be loyal, defend the nation, realize peace, establish the country on a solid foundation, and bring the people to a comfortable life. There is great hope for this. Executive Yuan President Sun Ke, stamped on the 21st of January.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Guangdong Chairman Song Ziwen came to Nanjing on the 20th to meet the President and returned to Guangzhou by plane on the morning of the 21st.

[This newspaper, Nanchang, 21st] The newly appointed Director of the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters, Yu Hanmou, passed through Jiangxi at noon on the 21st.

[This newspaper, Guangzhou, 21st] Army Commander-in-Chief and newly appointed Director of the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters Yu Hanmou arrived in Guangzhou by plane from Nanjing at 4 p.m. on the 21st and is scheduled to hold a handover ceremony for the new and old directors at the Pacification Headquarters at 10 a.m. on the 22nd.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] According to reliable information, when the President summoned Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army Guan Linzheng on the 20th, he inquired about sending him to succeed Yu Hanmou as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, but Mr. Guan was declining politely.

He then instructed the heads of various departments to prepare for the handover. At the press conference in the afternoon, Mr. Hu spoke freely about the peace talks, believing that peace requires sincerity and vision. He also said that the reorganization of the provincial government was in fact due to the fact that today's Jiangxi politics should be coordinated with military affairs. In the past few months, he has been in charge of Jiangxi politics as a civilian. After several months, he deeply felt that he should give way to capable people, and General Fang Tian is a rare military talent in Jiangxi. It is most appropriate for him to be ordered to be in charge of Jiangxi now. Mr. Hu also talked about his feelings about being in charge of Jiangxi, saying that he felt ashamed for not being able to reduce the burden on the people and not being able to properly stabilize their lives. He was not talented enough and failed the expectations of the elders. This is also the main reason for his resignation. As for the future situation in Jiangxi, Mr. Hu said: "It depends on the national political situation."

### Candidates for Negotiating Peace; Likely to be Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, and Wu Zhongxin; Communist Spokesperson Criticizes Executive Yuan's Resolution on Peace Talks

[Taibao, Nanjing, 21st] Observers here believe that President Chiang's resolute retirement to promote peace will lead to a decisive development in the political situation in the future. Vice President Li's exercise of presidential powers will begin on the 22nd. The general resignation of the Sun Ke cabinet is unlikely to be accepted by Mr. Li, and Mr. Sun is likely to continue to be responsible in order to cooperate with Acting President Li. With the inspiration of President Chiang's retirement, peace will be realized quickly. However, one or two cabinet members in the Sun cabinet may be slightly changed. If so, Huang Shaohong, who was rumored to be joining the cabinet when Sun Ke formed the cabinet but did not, may join the Executive Yuan and serve as the head of a certain ministry. The other cabinet members are unlikely to undergo major changes. As for the issue of ceasefire and peace talks with the Communist Party, Sun Ke will make a decision within his responsibilities. It is rumored that Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, and Wu Zhongxin have been ordered on the 22nd to negotiate with the Communist Party, but this has not been confirmed by relevant parties. However, it is believed that these four are the most suitable candidates for negotiations with the Communist Party. Regarding the Communist Party's broadcast opinion that the Executive Yuan's resolution on the 19th must be canceled before negotiations can be held, this is the biggest obstacle to Sun Ke's peace talks. However, this matter is expected to be mitigated by directly sending representatives for negotiations. If Mr. Sun insists on the decision to negotiate after a ceasefire, then the realization of peace will obviously still have some setbacks.

Original Text of the Communist Spokesperson's Remarks

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Since President Chiang Kai-shek's New Year's Day message was issued, the door to peace has been opened. The Executive Yuan's ceasefire resolution on January 19 was a further expression of the peace talks, which is obvious to all. According to the Xinhua News Agency broadcast on the evening of the 21st, the Communist spokesperson believes that the Executive Yuan's decision that the two sides should first cease fire "has closed the door to peace from now on." This shows that the Communist Party must first negotiate conditions and then cease fire and talk about peace. The following is the original text of the Xinhua News Agency broadcast.

"The official news agency of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government, the Central News Agency, reported on the 19th that at 9 a.m. on the 19th, the Executive Yuan meeting extensively discussed the situation and resolved as follows: "In order to follow the wishes of the people of the whole country and seek the early realization of peace, the government hereby expresses its sincere willingness to immediately and unconditionally cease fire with the Chinese Communist Party and appoint representatives to conduct peace talks." (The Chinese Communist Party spokesperson said: The Nanjing Executive Yuan's resolution did not mention the peace negotiation proposal suggested by Nanjing pseudo-President Chiang Kai-shek on January 1, nor did it mention the peace negotiation proposal suggested by Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong on January 14. It did not indicate which of these two suggestions it supports or opposes. It seems as if the Kuomintang and the Communist Party did not make any suggestions on January 1 and January 14. Instead, it put forward its own suggestions, which is completely incomprehensible. In fact, the Nanjing Executive Yuan not only completely ignored the CCP's proposal on January 14, but also directly overturned the pseudo-President Chiang Kai-shek's proposal on January 1.

### Huai River Battle Situation Tense Again; More Than 100,000 Communist Troops Advance Southward in Different Directions; Troops in Gaoyou and Hongze Lakes Actively Cross the Huai River

[This newspaper, Chuxian, 21st] The Huai River battle situation, which has been silent for more than ten days, is now becoming tense again. Intelligence that more than 100,000 Communist troops are advancing south toward Bengbu and Fengtai from the Xusu section of the Jinpu Railway and the Hao (County) Meng (City) Highway was officially confirmed this morning. At the same time, the local Communist forces on both sides of the Ming (Guang) Pu (Kou) section of the Jinpu Railway and the Huainan Railway are also becoming active. The military believes that the Communist troops seem to be taking advantage of the government's advocacy of peace talks to send large armies south across the Huai River in an attempt to advance directly into the Yangtze River, so as to create a more favorable situation and strive for a more favorable position for the Communist Party. Li Bingtuan Commander Yan Nian is still stationed in Chuxian, while Liu Bingguo Commander Ruming has moved to Wuhu. [Another telegram] The Communist troops led by Chen Geng and Kong Congzhou have been concentrating from Zhumadian in central Henan to the periphery of Xinyang for days, and seem to be launching an offensive against central China.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Communist troops in the Gaoyou and Hongze Lakes are actively crossing the Huai River southward. On the 20th and 21st, aerial reconnaissance showed that 40 Communist ships were crossing the river in Shuanggou, 200 ships were transporting Communist troops in Jiangba, 10 ships were in Huaiyangju, 1,000 civilians were building pontoon bridges for the Communist troops in Wuhe, 80 ships were transporting Communist troops in Changhuaiwei, and 1,000 tons of ships and 20 steamships were transporting large numbers of Communist troops in Bengbu to Huaiyuan. It is reported that those who entered Bengbu were the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 9th columns of Liu Bocheng's troops, and they entered Tianjiadian, Jiulonggang, and the Huainan coal mining area. About 8,000 Communist troops are currently moving south at will. If the southward movement continues according to the calculated time, they may be facing the 99th Army troops defending Mingguang across the trenches in three days.

### Qiu Qingquan Has Committed Suicide, Li Mi's Whereabouts Unknown

At the same time, civil servants in various counties will also be organized into administrative teams, and the Baojia chiefs will be organized into Baojia teams, so that they can act in unison when necessary.

### Travelers to Shanghai from Nantong Are Crowded

[This newspaper, Nantong, 21st] The people's hearts in Nantong are now slightly stable, but the passenger ships to Shanghai are very crowded. The south bank of Shiyiweigang Port in Liuhaisha, Tong District, has been approved for opening, and many people are traveling south through that port. The county's ship management office has organized the local ships that may be able to sail into three squadrons for easy management.

### The Northern Peace Negotiations Tend Towards Clarity Again. Xu Yongchang Flew to Beiping Yesterday and Returned to Nanjing on the Same Day, Conveying the President's Intention to Retire and Hoping That Fu Zuoyi Would Continue to be Responsible.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 21st] Minister of National Defense Xu Yongchang flew to Beiping by special plane on the morning of the 21st to meet with Fu Zuoyi, conveying President Chiang's intention to retire and hoping that he would continue to be responsible for the overall situation in North China. After completing his mission, he returned to Nanjing that evening.

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 21st] The "Beiping Daily" today carried a statement from an authoritative source saying: The date for the arrival of a local peace in the North is getting closer, but they are unwilling to specify the exact date of the arrival of peace. It is said that peace efforts are continuing and have already achieved decisive results, but it is not yet time for an announcement. However, one morning, the bells of peace will be heard. The speaker finally expressed confidence that the outcome of the peace talks will be better than generally imagined.

[United Press Beiping Dispatch on the 21st] The agreement for the transfer of Beiping to the Communist army for management has been resolved except for a few minor details, but no date has been specified. The contents of the agreement have not been announced, but an official announcement is being drafted. Farmers transporting food into the city are now exempt from inspection.

[Associated Press Beiping Dispatch on the 21st] The Beiping military authorities on the 21st ordered a halt to the demolition of buildings in the suburbs, and also ended restrictions on Beiping residents entering and leaving the city gates. Although these measures are seemingly minor, they are a concrete manifestation of the easing of the military situation and the trend towards a separate peace in North China.

[United Press Beiping Dispatch on the 21st] At noon today, two small shells exploded in the Weili Public Society empty field, less than a mile from the embassy district. The glass windows of several houses were shattered, but there was no other damage, nor were there any injuries.

[Central News Agency Beiping Dispatch on the 21st] A spokesman for the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters reported at a press conference on the afternoon of the 21st that the suburbs of Beiping have been generally calm for the past six days, except for small-scale skirmishes between the two sides.

Editorial

### The President's Sincerity in Seeking Peace

The President issued a statement yesterday, stating that because the New Year's Day appeal for peace has not yet been realized, the war has not yet ceased, the purpose of suppressing the rebellion is difficult to achieve, and the hope for peace remains dim. Therefore, in accordance with the Constitution, he has entrusted Vice President Li with the authority to act on his behalf, continuing to seek peace quickly to save the people from suffering. The President himself also flew from the capital yesterday to take a short rest in Zhejiang, demonstrating his sincerity in seeking peace.

Since the President's New Year's Day declaration that as long as peace can be achieved, his personal advancement or retreat will not be a concern, the door to peace has been widely opened. Unfortunately, the broadcast by Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party was still hostile, filled with the smell of gunpowder, and the hope for peace remained precarious. Fortunately, the Executive Yuan has a resolution that both sides should immediately cease fire and send representatives to negotiate, which was subsequently endorsed by the Central Political Committee of the Kuomintang. Whether the entire country can cease fire and make peace now depends entirely on the CCP's response. Yesterday, the President resolutely handed over his duties to Vice President Li, which was also approved by the Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang, further demonstrating that the Kuomintang and the central authorities deeply understand the suffering of the people of the entire country and will spare no effort to impress the Communist Party in the hope that the god of peace can truly descend upon China.

If the CCP members can still remember that they are also Chinese people, can still abide by their promise to "liberate" the people, and can still consider their broadcast of "quickly ending the war," they should immediately rein in their horses, agree to a cease-fire, and negotiate sincerely to complete the great task of peace, fulfilling the people's expectations.

Here, standing from the perspective of the people, we must deeply recognize and wish to inform the acting president and government officials that the president's sincerity in seeking peace is originally for the sake of the people, and the price that the people are willing to pay for peace has its own boundaries that must be adhered to. In short, we cannot sacrifice the country's independence and integrity in order to seek peace, we cannot abandon the country's democratic constitutional system in order to seek peace, we cannot sacrifice the people's freedom in order to seek peace, and we cannot even sacrifice the people's livelihood and ensure their living standards in order to seek peace. Therefore, seeking peace is acceptable, sacrificing oneself for peace is acceptable, sacrificing the people for peace is unacceptable, and pleasing the Communist Party by placing the country within an authoritarian "iron curtain" is unacceptable. President Truman of the United States said well at his inauguration the day before yesterday: "Peace cannot be achieved by pleasing the Communist Party, but only by strengthening the economic, military, and social strength of free countries." I sincerely hope that government officials will carefully consider these words while striving for peace!

### The Safe Withdrawal from Baitanggu Was Completed. Hou Jingru Flew to the Capital. The 17th Army Corps Decided to Transfer and Station on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 21st] General Hou Jingru, commander of the 17th Army Corps, who had firmly defended Tanggu, arrived in Qingdao by ship on the 20th after completing the safe withdrawal on orders.

It is heard that in order to strengthen the defense of the Nanjing-Shanghai line, the authorities have decided to transfer the 17th Army Corps to Shanghai and the Nanjing-Shanghai line.

However, when Hou met with reporters on the evening of the 21st, he did not affirm or acknowledge the above news, only saying that it has not yet been decided. According to Hou's words to reporters, this withdrawal from Tanggu was completed within a few hours after receiving the order. The losses of the National Army were less than a battalion. All ammunition, supplies, grain, and horses were safely transported out. In addition to the protection and transportation provided by the powerful naval fleet, more than 100 large and small ships were mobilized. Currently, our powerful naval fleet is still patrolling and monitoring the actions of the bandit army in the Bohai Sea and can land at any time. Hou also said that during this withdrawal, the Tanggu New Port project was not damaged, and Tanggu remained intact as before, in order to preserve the country's construction.

If time permits, he will fly back to Qingdao on the afternoon of the 22nd. According to Liu's words to reporters, Qingdao is now peaceful as always. After the last National Army attack to recover Jiaoxian, the Communist forces have not been able to retake it. Currently, there are only more than 30,000 regular troops and guerrillas of the bandit army around Qingdao. The National Army has a strong force, and if the bandits come to attack, they will definitely not succeed. Liu denied the rumors that the US military had withdrawn, but said that it was true that part of the US military had boarded warships. As for whether they will withdraw in the future, it depends on the US's national policy. Finally, Liu also said that regardless of whether the US military withdraws in the future, the National Army will never abandon Qingdao.

When asked if the government was waiting for this reply, he said no. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs only notified the envoys of various countries to move their embassies to Guangzhou, because the diplomatic corps had repeatedly asked the government whether it was necessary for them to move south. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had replied that if the facts required such measures, they would be notified as soon as possible so that they could make the necessary preparations. Now that the government has made a decision, it has made a formal notification to the envoys of various countries. If the envoys of various countries need the government's assistance in resolving issues such as transportation and housing during the relocation to Guangzhou, the government will naturally provide assistance. Currently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is actively planning this work, so there is no need to wait for the replies of various countries.

He also said that whether Canada and other embassies in China would move with the National Government had not yet been decided. "This depends on the decision of the entire diplomatic corps there. Under normal circumstances, it should move with the government, but the current situation is not normal. If the National Government is completely fragmented, it will be meaningless to move together." He continued that Canada had not made formal contact with the Communist army, but "several other countries" had informal contact with the Communist Party.

[Agence France-Presse Canberra Dispatch on the 21st] A spokesman for the Australian government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that even if the Chinese government moves to Guangzhou, the Australian diplomatic representative in Nanjing will likely not leave Nanjing.

It is formulated by measuring the current time, place, and environmental conditions. It is divided into six items: politics, economy, finance, education, culture, and health. Secretary-General Liu Mengchun emphasized at the meeting that this draft contains revolutionary significance, because under the foundation of establishing a democratic political system, it is necessary to allow the true people to be the masters, and the representatives and officials produced by popular elections should implement according to public opinion. However, the representatives of public opinion produced in this province in the past did not represent public opinion, but were local tyrants and evil gentry who raped public opinion, turning public opinion and the rule of law into tools to protect evil forces. Therefore, the provincial government should now lead a social revolution to thoroughly implement democratic politics.

### Spokesman for the Chinese Communist Party Speaks (Continued from page 2)

Chiang Kai-shek said in his New Year's Day address: "As long as the Communist Party has the sincerity for peace and can make a definite expression, the government will sincerely meet with them and is willing to discuss concrete methods to stop the war and restore peace." Nineteen days later, a part of the same government, namely the "Executive Yuan" of the Nanjing government, overturned the statement of the "President" of this government, not "sincerely meeting with them and being willing to discuss concrete methods to stop the war and restore peace," but "immediately first unconditionally cease fire and each designate representatives to conduct peace talks." We want to ask the gentlemen of the Nanjing "Executive Yuan," which of your suggestions is effective? Or is your "President's" suggestion effective? Your "President" considers "stopping the war and restoring peace" as one thing, declaring that he will sincerely meet with the CCP and is willing to discuss concrete methods to achieve this thing. You, on the other hand, separate war and peace into two things, unwilling to send representatives to discuss concrete methods with us to stop the war, but instead fantasize about first "unconditionally ceasing fire" and then sending representatives to "conduct peace talks." Which of your suggestions is correct? Or is your "President's" suggestion correct? We believe that the puppet Executive Yuan has exceeded its authority. It is not qualified to overturn the suggestion of the puppet President and even make new suggestions. We believe that this new suggestion of the Nanjing "Executive Yuan" is unreasonable. After fighting such a long, large, and cruel war, both sides should send people to discuss a basic ceasefire agreement before the war can subside. Not only do the people have this hope, but many people on the Kuomintang side have also expressed this hope. If, according to the Nanjing "Executive Yuan's" unreasonable resolution, it is unwilling to hold peace talks without first ceasing fire, then where is the Nationalists' sincerity for peace? The Nanjing "Executive Yuan's" resolution has been made, and there is no possibility of peace talks without first ceasing fire. The door to peace is closed from now on. And if you want to negotiate, you must either cancel this unreasonable resolution, or one of the two must be chosen. If the Nanjing "Executive Yuan" is unwilling to cancel its so-called resolution, then it shows that the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government has no sincerity in conducting peace talks with its counterpart. People want to ask, "If the Nanjing side has sincerity," why are they unwilling to discuss the conditions for peace? The Nanjing peace suggestion is false. Isn't such a conclusion already proven? Nanjing is now in a state of anarchy. The puppet President has one suggestion, and the puppet Executive Yuan has one suggestion. Who should people deal with?"

### The Chinese Communist Party Implies That It Requires Participation in the Occupation of Japan

After the new China itself gains freedom, it will strictly abide by the Potsdam Declaration, assist in the democratization of Japan, and prevent the revival of reactionary forces. Japan will be able to conclude a treaty with the Chinese people in the future and establish political and economic relations. The Chinese people hope to establish friendly relations with the Japanese people without any doubt."

### Asian Conference to Urge Security Council to Quickly Resolve the Dutch-Indonesian Dispute; Four-Nation Committee to Draft Proposals

[United Press, New Delhi, 21st] The nineteen Asian nations attending the New Delhi conference held a closed-door meeting on the 21st. Once again, they failed to reach an agreement on the establishment of a permanent group of Far Eastern countries to safeguard all rights. The conference decided that the drafting committee would determine the wording of the resolution, requesting "the Security Council to take countermeasures to promote a swift and satisfactory resolution."

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 20th] Following a closed-door meeting this evening, the Asian conference elected Australia, India, Ceylon, and Pakistan to form a four-nation committee to draft a final proposal to be submitted to the Security Council. This proposal will include all points discussed in the closed-door meeting earlier tonight. It is understood that the nineteen participating representatives and observers completed a general discussion of the proposals made by each representative at this morning's open meeting. The various proposals will be summarized in one proposal. Representatives from New Zealand and Abyssinia only arrived tonight and were therefore unable to attend this morning's open meeting.

[Further Dispatch] The Indian Ministry of External Affairs issued a public statement tonight stating that the Asian conference discussed the following five points in its closed-door meeting tonight: (1) Restoration of the Indonesian Republic government's complete freedom of action; (2) Return of the territory held by the Indonesian Republic government on December 18 to that government, with Dutch forces withdrawing from that area; (3) Establishment of a provisional government; (4) Election of a constituent assembly to transfer power to the United States of Indonesia; (5) Formation of a committee or other body by the Security Council, granted appropriate authority, to implement the above-mentioned recommendations. The above points will be listed in the proposal submitted by the four-nation drafting committee.

[United Press, New Delhi, 20th] Asian countries held a closed-door meeting at Hyderabad House on the 20th, resolving to request the Security Council to order the completion of Indonesian independence before the end of this year. The meeting also agreed to recommend to the Security Council that it order Dutch forces to immediately withdraw to the lines of December 18, with this withdrawal to be completed before March 15. Asian countries will also request the Security Council to guarantee the re-establishment of a reorganized provisional Indonesian government before March 18, but the meeting did not stipulate the date for convening the Indonesian constituent assembly. However, most representatives believe that this assembly should be held in mid-October so that the transfer of power to the republic can be completed before the end of the year. The issue of sanctions against the Netherlands will be discussed on the 21st, and its passage is expected to be beyond doubt. The Asian conference will discuss on the 22nd whether the current conference will become a permanent organization, and a widespread breakdown is anticipated on this matter.

### Four Nations Submit Proposal to the Security Council to Intensify Intervention in the Indonesian Situation; Aim to Achieve Indonesian Independence by the End of June Next Year

[Reported by this newspaper] New York, 21st Broadcast: Lake Success report: China, the United States, Norway, Cuba, and other countries jointly submitted a proposal to the Security Council today, advocating the rapid intensification of intervention in the Indonesian situation, with the aim of achieving independence for all of Indonesia before July 1, 1950.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 20th] The four-nation proposal for resolving the Dutch-Indonesian dispute is reported to have been completed tonight after nearly a week of active discussion by the Security Council representatives. Informed sources say that the United Kingdom has also expressed its agreement. It seems unlikely that the proposal will not pass around the 21st. The proponents are the United States, China, Norway, and Cuba, with Canada and Egypt expressing support. Adding the United Kingdom, this would make up the statutory majority of seven votes, but none of the five major powers can exercise their veto.

[Further Dispatch] The U.S. amendment to the Dutch-Indonesian issue proposes that the Security Council establish a committee to handle the Indonesian situation, suggesting methods for withdrawing Dutch troops, but without the authority to issue orders. This differs from the original U.S. plan. In addition, it requests a ceasefire between the Dutch and Indonesians, the release of imprisoned Indonesian political leaders, and the establishment of an Indonesian federation by July 1 next year.

### Dutch Prime Minister Beel Has Returned to The Hague

Negotiations with Indonesia Have Not Yet Reached an Agreement

[Associated Press, Batavia, 20th] Dutch Prime Minister Beel departed for The Hague today after a two-week inspection tour of the East Indies. It is said that the meetings between Dutch and Indonesian leaders over the past two weeks have taken several positive steps. First, the Netherlands has provided positive promises regarding the organization of a provisional government for the Indonesian Federation. Second, the Dutch and Indonesian sides have made further contact and created an atmosphere that allows all parties involved to conduct new consultations. The main objectives of the recent negotiations are threefold: (1) to quickly organize a provisional government for the Indonesian Federation; (2) to quickly prepare for the organization of an independent Indonesian Federation so that it can accept sovereignty from the Netherlands; (3) to hold free elections. If international concern over the issue of organizing the Indonesian Federation government is slightly reduced, the negotiations will be more effective. I have negotiated with former Indonesian Republic Prime Minister Sjahrir, and both sides have been frank and strived for cooperation. Whether the Dutch can reach a final agreement with the leaders of the Indonesian Republic remains to be reviewed by the Indonesian side.

### Truman Asks Congressmen to Support New Economic Aid Plan to Develop Backward Countries with Science and Technology

[Reported by this newspaper] Washington, 21st Broadcast: President Truman recently told congressmen from Missouri that he deeply hopes that congressmen can cooperate with him to seek world peace. The President stated that if the United States can improve the economic situation of other countries, war can be avoided. For example, if the purchasing power of Asian countries can increase slightly, the United States will be greatly prosperous.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th, United Press] Truman's bold new plan to build up backward areas of the world may be another major step in U.S. foreign policy, comparable to the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. The Truman's new plan is an international cooperation plan to develop backward areas with the advanced science and technology of the United States and other countries.

Truman declared that the United States "must undertake" this plan. World Bank President McCloy said that the President's plan was clearly conceived from "the written suggestions I recently presented to him." McCloy said that U.S. science and technology can be used globally without harming the United States, and the new economic plan can be "properly" implemented by the World Bank and the U.S. Export-Import Bank.

### Asian Countries Express Concern

[Associated Press, New Delhi, 21st] President Truman's inaugural address, advocating that the world use specialized technologies to promote human life, has today aroused concern at the Asian conference here. According to New Zealand representative Groggs, the world can be improved if scientific and technological knowledge can be fully utilized. Science is by no means the private property of any country or nation, but should be made public to the world. At the same time, Egyptian representative Kamel Bey also stated that his views are the same as those expressed by Indian Prime Minister Nehru the other day, that is, the basic goal of science must be to use its inventions to raise the living standards of all mankind.

### East Berlin City Council Established; Soviet Union Intensifies Purge of German Anti-Communists

Mayor Ebert delivered the opening address, reiterating the two demands that the Soviet Union has been promoting: (1) the withdrawal of all occupying forces; (2) the establishment of an all-German government.

[United Press, Berlin, 20th] According to reports, the Soviet Union is strengthening the purge of Communist leaders and German administrative officials in its occupation zone, and relying on the assistance of the leader system of Nazi espionage groups. As a result of the large-scale arrests (especially in the province of Saxony), the number of non-Communist German leaders fleeing the Soviet zone is increasing.

### Acheson Assumed Office Yesterday, Succeeding Marshall as Secretary of State; Three Major Issues Awaiting Resolution

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] The new U.S. Secretary of State Acheson has assumed office today and will implement Truman's four anti-communist foreign policies after being re-elected as president. His main task is to first encourage people to invest in foreign countries. The United States' foreign economic policy has almost reached a turning point. Although plans such as European recovery will proceed according to the planned steps, officials expect that from now on, emphasis will be placed on utilizing private capital and reducing direct government funding. There are currently three major issues that need to be addressed: completing the drafting of the North Atlantic Mutual Defense Treaty, implementing the comprehensive foreign aid bill, and drafting a detailed plan to fulfill the President's promise to increase production in backward areas of the world and thereby raise their living standards. The United States may send a large number of scientists and technicians abroad to investigate local conditions in order to determine how to assist in development.

### Good Response From All Sides to Truman's Speech

[Agence France-Presse, London, 20th] The British government has responded very positively to Truman's inaugural address. They particularly welcome the speech's emphasis on uniting Western European democracies through economic assistance and the need to place Western European countries under the protection of the Atlantic Pact. They are very interested in the suggestion of Truman's "bold new program," namely, assisting underdeveloped areas. Diplomatic circles believe that the generosity and proactiveness in this speech are similar to some of Roosevelt's speeches.

He sat in the diplomatic corps seat, and although he seemed to listen to Truman's speech, there was absolutely no emotional expression on Pan's face when Truman denounced communism. When asked what he thought of the speech, Pan replied that he had no opinion.

The China Licao General Assembly issued a letter to compatriots across the country yesterday to promote peace, saying: "Since President Chiang's New Year's Day message was published, the peace that the people of the whole country have been expecting has revealed a dawn. Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, also announced his intention for peace a few days ago. Although the peace negotiation terms are far apart, the opening of the door to peace is a fact. Whether peace can be achieved in the future, we hope that both sides will prioritize the country and the people, and sincerely make concessions to each other to realize a new China of peace, democracy, freedom, strength, prosperity, happiness. Since the founding of the Republic of China, there has been no peaceful year, and the suffering of the people has reached its extreme, especially after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, followed by three years of war. The vitality of the country has been greatly damaged, and its vitality is about to end. The people's desperate hope for peace is like expecting clouds in a severe drought. Now that peace is in sight, we are willing for the people of the country to seek to win it together. Our 18 million Licao members across the country vow to be the backing, in order to lay the foundation for the country's peace as soon as possible, and the people can enjoy the blessings of recovery, the river is clear and the sea is calm, and they can enjoy prosperity together. I urge compatriots across the country to rise up and plan for it together."

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables to Yuanbu Requesting Expediting Mail Service in Retreated Areas

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan Ministry of Transportation yesterday, requesting that mail services be properly planned as soon as possible within the possible scope in the retreated areas to facilitate the industrial and commercial year-end settlement and as a prelude to peace. The original telegram said: "Nanjing Executive Yuan Ministry of Transportation Junjian, Since recent years, the war zone has expanded day by day. Whenever an area is retreated, the post office immediately suspends mail service. Therefore, people in both places and industries and commerce in both places, once interrupted by military affairs, want to send letters, just like being separated by generations. Compared with residing in foreign countries, there is still the convenience of international mail service. It is also very different. People have been looking up to it for a long time, but they have not dared to report it lightly because of the busy military affairs and strict government orders. Now that the central government has taken into account the difficulties of the people and opened up a path to peace, and also when major cities have abandoned their guards one after another, the areas mentioned above have close industrial and commercial relations with Shanghai. At the end of the year, there are many things that need to be settled and negotiated between the commercial sectors in the two places. If mail service is still blocked, industry and commerce will have the suffering of suffocation. I must have compassion for these difficulties. It is proposed to properly plan the mail service method within the current possible scope and implement it as soon as possible, as a prelude to the period when peace is still being brewed, so that merchants and people can have a new experience and see the determination of the central government to rescue them from drowning. I am so grateful."

### Debate Concluded in Deng Zhonghe's Defamation Case; Verdict to Be Announced on the 26th; Defendant Filed Three Counterclaims Yesterday

After an hour of trial, the debate was concluded, and the verdict was scheduled to be announced at 4:00 PM on the 26th of this month.

Chen Zhen and Zhu Yakui, the defending lawyers of the plaintiff Zhu Zhengwen, stated that Zhu was unable to attend court due to illness. They represented the plaintiff, stating that although the plaintiff's accusation against the defendant as a traitor had been dismissed by the Zhejiang Higher Procuratorate, it was decided to apply to the Supreme Court for reconsideration. Since the case was related to the current case, they requested the court to postpone the trial. The court stated that the case had been delayed for a long time and could not wait any longer, and the trial proceeded as usual. Deng Zhonghe stated that the accusation that he colluded with the enemy during the occupation was completely fabricated, and he was threatened and extorted by Zhu, so he sent a telegram calling Zhu a "threatening bandit," which was entirely a passive self-defense. He presented the Zhejiang Higher Procuratorate's decision not to prosecute him for treason in court and filed three counterclaims: (1) Zhu invited reporters in late August last year to publish documents falsely claiming that he had rented the Anle Textile Factory to a Japanese yarn factory as employee dormitories. (2) He forged official documents from the Military Affairs Commission to threaten him. (3) He forged letters from Wanlilang to falsely accuse him of being a traitor. After the defending lawyers of both parties debated, the court ordered a scheduled verdict.

### Shenbao Education Aid Campaign Adds Special Grants

Our newspaper's "Reader Education Aid Fund" has decided to add various "special grants" to meet the needs of reality. If private individuals, groups, manufacturers, firms, and fellow-provincial associations, trade associations, etc., donate funds to help poor students, this newspaper will accept the wishes of the donors and handle all publicity, application, review, and distribution procedures, and the donors can specify their name.

For example, if a certain fellow-provincial association sees that many young people from the same province are out of school and wants to launch an education aid campaign, the target of assistance will be limited to young people from the same province. For another example, if a certain gentleman wants to commemorate his ancestors or sympathize with the suffering of young people out of school and donate funds to start an education aid fund, he can specify a name for commemoration.

For these special donations, we will do our best to assist with the same spirit of education aid as in the past and handle them on behalf of the donors. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, it would naturally be the most meaningful good deed if enthusiastic readers would donate their savings to help students. We have been appealing for several days, and donations are not as satisfactory as we had hoped, but we have 12 points of confidence in future achievements. Finally, we hope that enthusiastic readers can give us continuous support and encouragement.

### Three Overcoats and a Gun: Knowing His Brother Was No Good, a Rascal Threatened His Sister and Was Reported, Leading to His Arrest

[Our Newspaper] As the lunar year draws to a close, bandits are stirring and robberies are occurring frequently. Within the Nanshi district, there are often groups of thugs engaging in so-called "forced entry and removal" activities. Peng Rongfa, the deputy captain of the police, and his wife, Ms. Xu, reside at No. 1 Dexing Lane, Lujiabang Road. Peng's younger brother-in-law, Xu Yonglin, nicknamed "Head Chopper Ghost," is a rascal. On the evening of the 19th, at 9 p.m., while his brother-in-law was out, Yonglin barged into their home with a pistol in hand, threatening his sister. Fortunately, Ms. Xu was quick-witted and managed to escape and report the incident to the Penglai Branch Bureau. Section Chief Li ordered officers Lu Jihong, Zhao Chunpu, Li Fengyong, officers Li Xianwen, Bian Xicheng, and Chen Hailin to make an arrest, but he had already fled. It wasn't until around 1 a.m. the next morning that Xu Yonglin and his accomplice Yu Fuchang (nicknamed "Little Fuchang") were apprehended in a shantytown near Datongmen. A holster was found on Yu, and they were taken to the bureau for questioning, but both vehemently denied any illegal activities. However, investigations revealed that the two had a history of committing multiple thefts.

Xu also has an older sister named Fengying, who lives at a certain number on Gujiating, Lujiabang Road. Yesterday, she discovered a revolver and five bullets under her bed, which greatly surprised her. At the same time, Xu's older brother, Qilin, arrived and, after discussing the matter, both felt uneasy. Two months ago, Yonglin had borrowed 300 Gold Yuan from his older brother, which he never repaid. After several requests for repayment, Yonglin brought three men's and women's overcoats to settle the debt: a beige wool women's overcoat, a dark blue hai hu rong women's overcoat, and a silk men's overcoat. Fengying and Qilin knew their brother's bad character. After discussing it, and fearing being implicated, the siblings sent the revolver and overcoats to the Penglai Police Branch Bureau. Officers compared the holster with Yu Fuchang's and found that it matched, leading them to conclude that the gun belonged to Yonglin. As a precaution, the two suspects were detained and rigorously interrogated about other crimes they had committed. It is reported that two other accomplices of the two suspects have been arrested by the Songshan Branch Bureau and are also under investigation.

### Easy Credit, Strong Buying Interest: Rice Prices Rise Again; Flour Fluctuates Slightly, Edible Oil Continues to Increase

The rice market rose yesterday because other commodity prices had increased significantly on the previous day, while rice prices had fallen. Therefore, people expected prices to rise, and sellers made every effort to hold up prices. In addition, loose credit increased buying interest. In the North Market, white geng rice was priced at 1,670 yuan, an increase of 120 yuan; thin indica rice rose 70 yuan; early indica rice also rose to 1,550 yuan; xian rice rose 100 yuan, and both varieties of face white rice rose 50 yuan.

Mung beans were firm, and adzuki beans rose sharply.

Edible Oil

Continued to rise, with soybean oil and raw oil rising the most. Prices rose 500 yuan at the opening yesterday. Midway through the day, due to even looser credit, retailers purchased aggressively, pushing prices up the most. Prices fell back at the close because prices of other commodities did not rise much. Soybean oil opened at 7,000 yuan, once reaching a high of 7,500 yuan, but closed at 7,300 yuan, up by 800 yuan.

### Increase in Floating Capital in the Market: Estimated to Reach Over One Billion Yuan

Recently, remittances from inland China to Shanghai have increased again, and credit is loosening, causing speculation to stir again. People are successively absorbing materials into the market. It is estimated that the floating capital gathered in the market has increased to over one billion yuan. Although the China Textile Corporation and the China Industrial and Mining Corporation continue to sell materials, it is still insufficient to meet the demand, causing prices to rise again.

Tung Oil: Rising Strongly

Recently, tung oil market conditions have seen only sporadic transactions because as the lunar new year draws near, most industry participants are reluctant to trade. However, since credit has gradually loosened, profits are extraordinarily high.

### China Textile Still Lists for Sale, Cotton Yarn Initially Rises Then Falls

The trend of cotton yarn yesterday was initially high and then low. Credit within the industry was both loose and tight, but prices of other commodities generally softened. The financial black market trended sideways, and people's sentiments calmed, and the desire to buy declined.

42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 91,000 yuan. After the American Aid Council listed for sale again, and supply became plentiful, people's sentiments softened. Retailers turned from buyers to sellers, and prices fell slightly by 2,000 yuan. Afterwards, large accounts closed out positions, and the trend weakened further, falling all the way to a closing price of 79,000 yuan, a decrease of 7,000 yuan.

40-count followed, falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. 32-count fell sharply by 8,000 to 9,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse initially opened with firm sentiments, and prices did not fall, with many still trying to push prices up. The initial price was 61,000 yuan, rising by 2,000 yuan in an instant. However, buying interest was weak, and people's sentiments weakened. Afterwards, the American Aid Council listed for sale, causing the market to plummet. Retailers turned from buyers to sellers, and many followed the downtrend. Prices fell straight down, closing at 51,300 yuan, a decrease of 8,500 yuan.

Cotton Cloth: Firm

Cotton cloth trended firm. Rumors of a peace agreement were spreading, and the authorities were discussing registering materials, causing sensitive parties to be wary and sell off slightly. Credit within the industry remained loose, with daily interest rates at around 45 yuan. Four Gentlemen yuan bi ji initially weakened and then strengthened, opening at 2,200 yuan, immediately falling to 2,080 yuan, and then rising to 2,190 yuan near the close. Ultimately, it closed at 2,170 yuan, unchanged from the previous day. Jinlian miaowu finally traded at 2,200 yuan, a rise of 70 yuan.

### Silk Continues to Fall

The silk market yesterday initially rose and then softened. Initially, the price of gold was still good, floating capital was abundant, buying interest was still strong, and people's sentiments seemed quite firm, so prices opened high. Later, as the Lunar New Year approached, various industries arranged their finances, and the prices of other commodities generally softened. The foreign exchange certificates also showed no improvement, and the price of gold fell back, so people's sentiments turned weak.

120-count Tianqiao initially opened at 91,000 yuan, but large accounts sold off dramatically, and the market quickly softened. The morning session closed at 87,000 yuan. In the afternoon session, credit tightened slightly, and the price of gold fell again, so people's sentiments became even weaker. Many retailers continued to sell off, and the trend continued to soften, with prices continuing to fall by 200 yuan.

The price of foreign exchange transfer certificates for raw silk has been hovering without improvement in recent days. Foreign firms have stopped purchasing, and the silk weaving industry has reached the time for holidays and shutdowns, so actual sales are also weak and trading is quite light. Premium retail lots opened at 96,000 yuan in the morning, but no one inquired about them for half a day. The market was as still as water. The prices of yarn and cloth weakened, and people's sentiments were uncertain, so the market closed with a further decline, ending at 92,500 yuan.

Chouduan was initially affected by fluctuations in gold prices, and prices rose as soon as trading opened. Afterwards, the price of gold fell back, and buying interest turned weak, so prices also fell. However, because there was no way out for floating capital in the market recently, and yarn and cloth were suppressed, the focus shifted. The market softened and then strengthened, and prices generally rose at the close. Meiya bedspreads opened at 53,500 yuan, and there was a rush to push up prices on the trading floor, rising by 5,000 yuan in an instant. After the price reached a high, more people closed out positions, and the market saw selling pressure. The prices of other commodities weakened further, and people's sentiments were depressed. The morning session closed at 56,500 yuan, and prices were still weak in the afternoon session, with prices falling by another 4,000 yuan.

### Taiwan Sugar Initially High Then Flat

The sugar market trended firm yesterday, with prices rising across the board. Credit in the market loosened, and interest rates fell back, so holders of goods were mostly waiting and watching. However, because the Lunar New Year was approaching and there were rumors of a peace agreement, the market trended initially high and then flat.

45-count che bai jing trended sharply higher at the opening, and people's sentiments were quite bullish. There did not seem to be much stock in the market, and merchant buying interest was keen, pushing prices towards a peak. Afterwards, the price of gold fell back, and there were many rumors, so people had many concerns, and the market trended softer after being high. In the afternoon, there was a further rise of 200 yuan to 3,600 yuan, and coarse sand also rose 200 yuan. Others such as Xingbai, red he, sea red, mian red, diaoqing, etc., all rose by about 200 yuan.

With stars like Lin Jingyi, Zhu Min, and Li Miao, they are all top players. Their participation marks the first time a women's school team has joined the league. Their debut tonight is sure to be a spectacular performance. The Li team is newly formed and boasts good players like "Pigtail" Qian Chuping, Zeng Zhaoqing, and Yao Silian. Their strength is not to be underestimated.

Following that, Donghua initially meets Storm in A2A. Donghua, except for Chen Xianglong, is entirely composed of famous football players. Their style is aggressive. Banglun, Youliang, and Longhai are also skilled in basketball. The team won the A2 division championship in the previous season, dominating one side, which is quite commendable. Storm is organized by students from Nanshi Model High School. They are young, strong, and full of vigor. Under the guidance of American professional coach Yang Stanlai, their tactics are novel. Meeting Donghua, they will be able to display their skills.

The highlight is the A1 division match between Hualian and Haiqing. Hualian is the champion of the previous season. Their reputation is well-established. This season, they have added newcomer Le Jiazhou and veteran Chuan Jinsheng from the North, so their fighting power remains formidable. Dagong was unable to participate in the championship this season, but their hopes remain high. They recently defeated Encas in a friendly match, so their prowess has not diminished. Haiqing is the elite of the U.S. Navy. They have thoroughly researched basketball, are physically fit, and fight bravely. They are sure to pose a threat to Hualian.

### Hangzhou: A Casual Discussion on Non-Defense

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Chu Yusheng

[Airlifted Dispatch from Hangzhou, 19th of This Month by This Newspaper] With frequent wars, major cities across the country are worried about artillery fire attacks, so they are intermittently fantasizing about becoming undefended cities. Beijing and Tianjin made public appeals some time ago, but artillery fire is merciless, and eventually they were affected.

Hangzhou, a world-renowned scenic spot, has recently begun to see a faint call for "non-defended city" status as the smell of gunpowder gradually approaches. The cause is this: Hangzhou City Council members, thinking about the horrors of war, had Speaker Zhang Heng voice the demand for "Hangzhou to be a non-defended city" at a meeting. At the general meeting of the City Council this month, Zhang Heng formally stated in his opening speech that he wanted to send a telegram to both sides stating, "Hangzhou is a non-defended city," and also emphasized that Hangzhou has always "opposed civil war."

The reporter searched the classics for the explanation of the so-called non-defended city. According to the Practical Dictionary of War: "That is, a city that has not been equipped with defensive works. According to international law, when two countries go to war, they must not bomb non-defended cities." According to Zheng Bin's International Law in Wartime, Article 117, it states: "Article 25 of the Hague Regulations on Land Warfare stipulates: No matter what means are used, it is not allowed to attack or bombard undefended areas (cities, villages, houses). This article also prohibits airplanes from bombing from the air, but what is meant by undefended areas is open to interpretation." Cai Kecheng's International Law in Extraordinary Times states: "(A) The Hague Regulations prohibit attacking undefended towns, villages, residences, or buildings by any means whatsoever. In other words, international law only allows belligerent countries to bombard defended towns, but the so-called 'defended' refers to the presence of troops, not the existence of fortresses. Also, the Hague Regulations' 'by any means whatsoever' probably includes aerial attacks by airplanes. (B) Belligerent countries can bombard the entire defended town regardless of fortresses and houses, but they must not attack undefended private houses. At the same time, efforts must be made to preserve religious, artistic, scientific, charitable, and other cultural institutions or buildings, as well as hospitals, etc., that are undefended at the time and not used for military purposes. However, these institutions and buildings must have their special marks, which can be seen from a distance, notified to the enemy army in advance."

Based on the above, we know that the so-called "non-defended city" originated from international wars, not from civil wars. However, in the Second World War, German and Austrian missiles bombed undefended cities in Britain and France, and Japanese planes wantonly bombed undefended cities in the rear of China, causing criticism from world public opinion. However, later, Britain and France, under the pretext of revenge, took the same actions. All of this can be said to have broken the rules of "non-defended cities."

During the two World Wars, the only country that was truly unaffected by the war was Switzerland, a permanently neutral country. Switzerland has scenery as beautiful as Hangzhou, numerous cultural institutions, and a very high standard of living and culture. Their universities, middle schools, and primary schools are on a scale that our country cannot match, and cultural activities are spread to every corner. The number of libraries, etc., for studying specialized knowledge is unknown. Because of this, she was able to mediate international wars and protect her own safety. However, on September 2, 1939, the second day of the German-Polish War, Switzerland had to implement military mobilization. On September 3, the day Britain and France declared war on Germany, Switzerland became even more tense. Fortunately, the German army considered this beautiful world cultural fortress and directly attacked France through the Netherlands and Belgium. Also, in the First World War, because France and Belgium had learned from the First World War, the two countries built a solid defense line in the eastern part of their territory, such as the German advance into France through Switzerland, behind the right rear of the Maginot Line. Moreover, because the right wing of the French Maginot Line was a weaker link in the eastern defense line of France, it could directly attack the rear of the second fortress line of France. Cooperating with the German army advancing from Belgium, they completed the extension and encirclement of the two wings of Paris. However, later, because they considered this beautiful world cultural fortress, they chose the difficult path and directly attacked the Netherlands, Belgium, and entered France. Therefore, we can also understand that in international affairs, Belgium is also a permanently neutral country, but Belgium could not avoid both World Wars, while Switzerland alone could turn danger into safety. What is the meaning of this? This time, the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is a domestic war. Can Hangzhou's status be applicable to international war rules and extended to the position of domestic war? This should be a question. At the same time, many preconditions for the so-called "non-defended city," can they be achieved? This is also a question. However, the reporter believes that Hangzhou is indeed a beautiful place. Unfortunately, there is very little cultural construction. If we can strengthen cultural construction, so that Hangzhou not only has a beautiful appearance but also a rich content, then the warring units will not bear to destroy this beautiful cultural fortress.

At this city council meeting, we will also discuss the issue of "building Hangzhou into a cultural city" that the reporter advocated. They have mentioned it twice in the opening ceremony, and we hope to quickly promote its success!

### Wuxi's Various Organizations Respond to Peace

[Dispatch from Wuxi by This Newspaper, 20th of This Month] Recently, various organizations in this county have received letters from various places in Nanjing and Shanghai, inquiring about the opinions of Wuxi people on peace. Qian Sunqing, Chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, and Li Ti, Speaker, compiled the letters and specially invited temporary conveners of public and private organizations to a meeting yesterday to discuss the matter. After summarizing the local opinions adopted by everyone, Qian Sunqing was publicly elected to draft the document, which will be signed and issued on the 22nd. The original draft stated: The flames of war are pressing on our eyebrows, and the decision between peace and war has not been made in the court. The army is wandering, and the people are afraid. The President's New Year's Day message stated that the Three Principles of the People have not been realized, and the national crisis is even more serious, which is taken as his own fault. Moreover, the military burden on the people has been increased, and the people's suffering has been deepened. Deep consideration must be given to the people's hope for peace to be realized as soon as possible. The CCP stated that no matter what the conditions, it also advocates ending the war quickly and reducing the suffering of the people. In short, all of this can be summarized as convening a political consultation conference, and all problems can be easily solved. The public and private organizations of our Wuxi people sincerely support the President's New Year's Day message and believe that under the government's advocacy of the principle of peace, the following matters should be paid attention to and implemented in advance: (1) Abolish special criminal courts and military trials for people not related to military affairs. (2) Release political prisoners who have been arrested and all political prisoners in custody. (3) Open up legitimate public opinion and stop the arrest of political reactionaries in various places, so as to truly achieve democracy and peace.

### Village Talk in Fuzhou

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Zheng Shizhu

[Airlifted Dispatch from Fuzhou by This Newspaper, 19th of This Month] When one flies from Nanjing or Shanghai and arrives in the airspace above Fuzhou Airport after a three-hour flight, the first thing that catches the eye are the scattered villages nearby, the crisscrossing fields, the dense forests, and the wide, quiet rivers all around.

Since the establishment of the Baonong Cooperative and the Farmers' Association, disputes between tenant farmers and landlords often occur during the harvest season. Today's landlords are mostly newly rich people. They occupy mostly between ten and thirty acres of land, and they often have a residual sense of superiority in the local area. They depend on the income from the land, and they also feel like they are barely surviving due to the restrictions of land laws, years of drought and crop failure, and heavy taxation. Therefore, every time the harvest is divided, they must argue fiercely and try their best to prevent the tenant farmers from reaching the amount stipulated in the land law. The power of the local gentry in each village varies, thus creating various temporary tacit agreements. Even honest tenant farmers have not benefited from the new law at all. The new land law will collect land exceeding 30 acres, but in the villages around these dozens of miles, there are really too few people who own more than 30 acres of land.

When you want to buy some agricultural by-products in the village, sometimes you will run into a snag. When you want to buy a two-jin hen, they want twenty-two jin of grain. It turns out that most of the transactions in the village are now done with grain as the medium of exchange. However, small-scale transactions still cannot do without paper money, which has become a new bimetallic system.

Recently, the quiet villages have added many guests from restless places. One type is veteran soldiers, who are scattered in various villages in groups of two to three hundred or dozens of people. The value of the paper money in their hands is often higher than that of ordinary people. They also often receive various unavoidable free preferential treatments. The issue of military discipline in wartime is always a headache. Another type is foreign brides who speak different languages, evacuees who are mute, or children who grew up in other places. They also instinctively learn the sign language of deaf and dumb schools.

During the emergency evacuation period in Nanjing and Shanghai, the houses in Fuzhou city were not enough, so the temples or large houses in the villages were also posted with evacuation organization notices. The farmers in the villages are hoping for peace to come soon, hoping that these notices will be torn off automatically soon.

### Jiaxing Grain Officials' Malpractice: Farmers Hold Certificates to Accuse

[Dispatch from Jiaxing by This Newspaper, 19th of This Month] Twelve farmers, including Shen Guanshou, from the 31st Bao of Jiaxiu Town, transported rice collectively to the Tianliang Branch Office in the east of the city on the 17th to pay this year's grain tax. When it was weighed, it was found that there was a huge difference from the original weight, which aroused suspicion. After careful attention, it was discovered that the bamboo baskets for holding grain at the office had a false weight increase. Therefore, they weighed a bamboo basket with three of them and took it to the town office for evidence. At the same time, they complained to the Senate. In addition to sending personnel to investigate thoroughly, County Chief Chen said that he would transfer the case to the court for strict punishment.

### Yu Chao, Assistant Manager of the Bank of China's Tunxi Branch, Drug Case Partially Concluded

[Dispatch from Tunhan by This Newspaper, 13th of This Month] The case of Yu Chao, the manager of the Tunxi branch of the Bank of China, who smoked opium, hoarded, and embezzled, has been largely investigated and interrogated. The Xiuning District Prosecutor's Office has recently discovered new clues, which are said to be wider than before, involving dozens of suspected accomplices, and most of them are important bank officials. The Xiuning District Prosecutor's Office has issued separate documents to the courts under their jurisdiction, requesting them to investigate the case nearby. According to the case, which has occurred for several months, the drug use part has been sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment by the Criminal Court of the Xiuning District Court. The remaining parts will also be prosecuted before the end of this month. The change may extend the trial period.

[Another Dispatch] The Anhui Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau will soon send a survey team to the south to survey the upper reaches of the Xin'an River for suitable small-scale hydropower plant projects. The Anhui Provincial Government has also telegraphed the Southern Anhui Administrative Office here to send personnel to conduct on-site surveys for planning and construction. In the future, after the Jiekou Dam is built, this number of small power plants, like satellites, will be connected into one, and the prospect of electrifying the southeast can be seen. The slogan of building Southern Anhui will also be gradually developed with this power.

### Two Professors at Guangxi University's Preparatory Class Fight Each Other

Dispute Between Teachers and Students at Guilin Vocational School

[Airlifted Dispatch from Guilin by This Newspaper, 18th of This Month] More than 300 students in the preparatory class of National Guangxi University are deadlocked with the school authorities over the issue of direct promotion. On the 17th, a strange incident of professors fighting each other occurred. Deputy Professor Zhan Daoming of the school, in the name of the chairman of a private middle school in Liuzhou, raised funds from students, which was quite large. Deputy Professor Wang Chaowei reported this to the school, saying that Zhan was coercing students to donate money, and the students' academic performance depended on the amount of donation. After investigation by the school, it was found that there was no such thing, and Wang was reprimanded for causing trouble for no reason. Therefore, Wang held a grudge in his heart. When they met on campus, Wang punched Zhan with his old fists, causing him to bleed from the head. The professors and students, believing that Wang was unreasonable, supported Zhan and proposed three conditions for Wang to accept: (1) Please Wang resign, (2) Apologize to Zhan, (3) Compensate for medical expenses. Wang also knew that he was in the wrong, so he packed his bags and left.

[Another Dispatch] Following the Guangxi University incident, there was a dispute between teachers and students at the provincial Guilin Vocational School. The incident originated from the students of the Spinning Class 1 of the school, who were dissatisfied with the Dean of Students Chen Xuan. On the 14th, they surrounded Chen in the office and questioned him, saying that Chen was unfair in his work and the principal did not care about school affairs. Afterwards, they asked the provincial government and the provincial council to replace the Dean of Students and punish the principal. The school authorities defended themselves to the public on five points: (1) The principal often stays in the school and handles school affairs. On the 14th, student Wu Lijun cheated in the exam and refused to accept punishment. The students of the class were used to surround Dean Chen. (2) Dean Chen Xuan has been working hard since taking office. (3) Student Zhao Fengsheng was corrupt in handling food and has been ordered to find a guarantor to pay back the money within a limited time, and will be punished after the money is paid back. (4) Student Wu Lijun cheated in the exam and was given two minor demerits. Afterwards, he insulted the teacher in the office and was given two major demerits. (5) The students published news in the newspaper saying that the teacher and student representatives visited Huang Puxin, Director of the Provincial Department of Education, on the 17th to petition, but there was no such fact. The students pointed out that Director Chen was unfair in his handling, did not accept the students' requests, did not punish student Zhao Fengsheng, who was corrupt with more than 1,000 jin of rice, but gave student Wu Lijun, who cheated in the exam, two minor demerits and two major demerits. The principal did not stay at the school on weekdays. On the day of the incident, he hurriedly returned to the school and explained to the students in the class that Wu's two demerits were a mistake, hoping to calm the public anger. Currently, the students are determined to replace the Dean of Students and punish the principal, and the matter has not been resolved.

### The Dynamics of Refugee Students in Jiangxi

— Reporter for This Newspaper, Liu Zao

A Glimpse of School Relocation

The war has spread from the Yellow River to the Yangtze River. Currently, schools in the Pinghan Road and Shanghai-Nanjing areas are still preparing to relocate south. Nanjing Zhengda University has decided to relocate to Gan County. More than 100 people from Tangshan Institute of Technology have arrived in Pingxiang. According to news from the Department of Education, 1,341 students from the war zone have been received for transit. Among them, there are 3,942 students from Henan, 5,909 from Shandong, 500 from Hebei, and 350 from the Northeast. Among them, 5,909 people have transferred to Hunan, and 8,392 people have stayed in various counties and cities in Jiangxi Province. Among them, 300 students from Henan Provincial Anyang High School are located in Chashi, Fengcheng. 350 students from Anyang Middle School are located in Chashi, Fengcheng. 550 students from Zhengxian Agricultural High School are located in Hepu, Yichun. 250 students from Zhengzhou Joint Middle School are located in Niuwan, Qingjiang. 300 students from Wuzhi Middle School are located in Yongtai, Qingjiang. 200 students from Zhongzheng Middle School are located in Ji'an. 160 students from Suiyang Middle School are located in Xiangdong Village, Nanchang City. 700 students from Zhengxian Branch School are located in Qingyuan Mountain, Ji'an. 500 students from Hebei Provincial Second Provisional Middle School are located in Shangdundu, Linchuan. 300 students from the Youth Guidance Class of the Ministry of Education are located in Fenyi. 580 students from Henan Provincial Kaifeng Girls' Middle School are located in Fenyi. 400 students from Zhiqiang Middle School are located in Shangqing Palace, Guixi. 2,000 students from Daliang Middle School are located in Qianshan. 429 students from Henan Provincial Commercial College are located in Gao'an. 300 students from Jixian Middle School are located in Fengcheng. Some students from Lizhi Middle School have arrived in the province and are located in Yanxi Ferry, Taihe.

Difficulties

The most difficult thing for the Jiangxi Department of Education regarding refugee students in the war zone is that the students from various schools are scattered in various places. The Jiangxi Department of Education can only fulfill its responsibility as the host to receive or find ways to settle them. The funds for each school are not within its power and cannot be borne. However, sometimes students have no food to eat, but they still turn to the Department of Education for help, which makes "Zhou Fuzi" feel unable to help. Therefore, he hopes that the Provincial Department of Education, which is relocating schools from the war zone to Jiangxi, should send people to Jiangxi to set up an agency to be responsible for managing the students and paying their expenses. Before the school is relocated, they should contact the Jiangxi Department of Education to consider the local situation and solve the problems of school site allocation and food supply.
