### One More Peace Talk Representative Added; Liu Fei Appointed, Emphasizing Military Negotiations; A Total of 30 People Will Fly to Beiping in Two Groups; Zhang Zhizhong Went to Xikou to Report to President Chiang

[Our Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] The number of government peace talk representatives has increased to six, which was approved at the political affairs meeting on the 29th. The new appointee is Liu Fei, who is said to be focusing on military negotiations. At the same time, the political affairs meeting officially approved the appointment of Zhang Zhizhong as the chief representative of the delegation, Lu Yuwen as the secretary-general, and decided to invite several advisors to join the delegation. The preparation for the delegation has reached the completion stage, and the steps for peace talks have also been prepared. Zhang Zhizhong flew to Hankou at 10:00 AM on the 29th to report on the preparation situation and seek instructions from Kuomintang President Chiang, and had not yet returned to Nanjing by evening. Huang Shaohong arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 29th, and Zhang Shizhao may also arrive in Nanjing on the morning of the 30th. Shao Lizi and others did not meet on the 29th. Huang visited Acting President Li, President He, and Shao Lizi separately to exchange views on peace talks.

[Our Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] The preparation work for the government peace talk representatives has been completed. The departure date has been decided to be in two batches. The first batch, led by Secretary-General Lu Yuwen, will take the Central Bank's special plane on the 31st with personnel from the Secretariat and representatives for postal and aviation communications. The second batch will be the delegation and its commissioners and entourage, who will take the China Aviation special plane on April 1. The Secretariat personnel total ten people, the postal representatives five, and the number of advisors is undetermined. In total, the delegation itself, together with the Secretariat personnel, will be thirty people. The government has notified the Chinese Communist Party authorities in Beiping by telegram on the afternoon of the 29th.

[Our Dispatch] Zhang Shizhao went to Nanjing by car last night with his personal secretary, Pan Baiying. Zhang's students hosted a farewell banquet at noon, and business community figures such as Luo Qinghua hosted a welcome banquet in the evening.

[Our Changsha, 29th Dispatch] Zhang Zhizhong telegraphed Li Junlong to invite him to be an advisor to the delegation. Li resides in his hometown of Xiangxiang and was picked up by a special car at 2:00 PM on the 29th, and is expected to arrive in Changsha and transfer to Nanjing on the morning of the 30th. According to Li's registry in Xiangxiang, the Communist Party representative Li Weihan is from Changsha, and the rumor in the Nanjing telegram that the two are brothers is a misrepresentation.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] According to the spokesperson of the Presidential Office, Acting President Li did summon President He, President Yu, and President Tong on the evening of the 28th to discuss various issues related to the current situation. However, the rumor that he summoned members of the Kuomintang Central Committee and members of the Central Political Committee is completely unfounded.

[Reuters, Moscow, 28th Dispatch] The Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Dr. Fu Bingchang, reiterated today that he has not yet decided whether to assume the post of Foreign Minister in He Yingqin's cabinet. Fu explained that he still needs to discuss in detail with Premier He and his friends in China. Due to the distance, it will take some time. He cannot make any decision until he has thoroughly studied the entire situation. When asked if there was a possibility that he would ultimately refuse to take the post of Foreign Minister, Fu replied that since he had not yet made a final decision, the possibility of refusing to accept the post certainly existed. Fu declined to comment on the domestic peace issue.

(2) The United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom should act as mediators to bring the two sides to a state of truce, gradually forming a situation of "peaceful separation of rule."

### Zhang Junmai Goes to Nanjing to Discuss National Affairs at Invitation

[Our Dispatch] Zhang Junmai accepted an invitation from Acting President Li and traveled to Nanjing by train last night. Jiang Yuntian, Yang Yuzi, Cui Xin, and others from the business community accompanied him. It is said that they will return in three days.

### Yan Xishan Arrives in Nanjing Upon Summons; Scheduled to Call on the Acting President This Morning to Discuss Peace Plan; Emphasizes to Reporters That Peace Talks Must Be Based on Fairness

[Our Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] As peace talks are about to begin, Director Yan Xishan responded to Acting President Li's telegram and flew to Nanjing from Taiyuan at 9:40 PM on the 29th. The main task of Yan's trip is to come to Nanjing to discuss the peace plan together, and he will stay in Nanjing for several days. When Acting President Li telegraphed Yan on the evening of the 28th, he originally planned to send a special plane to pick him up, but Yan politely declined. He changed to taking a grain transport plane to Nanjing, taking off from Taiyuan at 6:50 PM and arriving at the Dajiaochang Airport at 9:40 PM. Acting President Li's representative, Deputy Chief of Staff Liu Shiyi, as well as Deputy Premier Jia Jingde, Minister Xu Yongchang, Zhang Yaoming, and Wen, etc., were all at the airport to welcome him. After Yan arrived in Nanjing, he drove to the Capital Hotel to rest and then had dinner. He is scheduled to call on Acting President Li at 9:00 AM on the 30th.

[Our Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] Yan Xishan met with reporters late on the 29th. During the conversation, he emphasized that the foundation of peace talks must be based on fairness, and that the procedure should be a ceasefire first, followed by peace talks. However, since the other party is involved, whether a ceasefire can be achieved first remains to be discussed. Yan avoided answering the reporter's questions about his views on the prospects for peace and the minimum position that the government should adhere to, citing his lack of understanding of the actual situation, but repeatedly stated that since it is for peace talks, there should be a fair method in principle. As for how to deal with Taiyuan in the future, Yan said that he would listen to the government's arrangements, but hoped that Taiyuan could still be retained in the peace talks and not be taken over by the other party. If this were to happen, it would be unfair. When asked about his attitude towards the two points raised by the Chinese Communist Party, punishing war criminals and reorganizing the army, Yan said that he had not yet considered them. When asked about his feelings about being included in the list of war criminals by the Chinese Communist Party, Yan smiled and said that in the situation of hostility between the two sides, this is a normal thing. When talking about the current situation in Taiyuan, Yan said that Taiyuan is still calm, and both sides are engaged in underground warfare. The number of enemies has recently increased, and they have announced the addition of three army corps and strengthened their political warfare, but we are prepared. Since the last air transport of food, there were initially 70 planes transporting every day, each with 30 tons, which could transport 200 tons per day. However, due to unfavorable weather conditions at times, from February 16 to now, according to the transportation volume stipulated by the government, there is a shortage of 467 flights, a shortage of about 1,000 tons of grain. It is hoped that it can still be made up in the future. This is Yan's third visit to Nanjing, and his spirit is more vigorous than the last time. He still has full confidence in the future of Taiyuan.

### Sun Ke Writes Letter to Yu Youren

Defends Use of Confidential Funds

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th Dispatch] Sun Ke, the former Premier of the Executive Yuan, wrote a letter to Yu Youren, the President of the Control Yuan, on the 26th regarding the use of confidential funds, stating: "Regarding the matter of my use of confidential funds during my tenure as Premier of the Executive Yuan, newspapers have repeatedly published reports recently. Because I have not received an official document from your esteemed office, I am not willing to make any defense. However, rumors are accumulating and destroying bones, and I have endured until now. I cannot but say something to you. The use of confidential funds by the Premier of the Executive Yuan has long been a precedent. All previous Premiers of the Executive Yuan have handled it in the same way. Even in foreign countries, the use of confidential funds by heads of government is also a common occurrence. The use of confidential funds by the Premier of the Executive Yuan in our country is mostly to cope with temporary emergency expenses or for political purposes, and it is not included in the ordinary administrative budget. I was appointed at a time of crisis, and there were many kinds of temporary emergency expenses. Moreover, at a time of emergency, the use of various political funds also increased accordingly. In addition, the currency was constantly depreciating, and the original office expenses were far from enough, so I had to rely on confidential funds to supplement them. However, because the allocation procedures were complicated, I often felt that they were not timely. Therefore, I instructed Zhang Zhaoyuan and my son, Zhi Ping, to borrow money in Shanghai to meet the urgent needs. The 110 million Gold Yuan used in confidential funds was used to repay the principal and interest of the emergency funds borrowed repeatedly in Shanghai over the past three months. This was purely for public expenditure. This is the truth of the case, and I am telling you this not to ask for anything. I have served the party and the country for more than thirty years and have always known how to discipline myself. There was a Meng Mu who moved three times, but there has never been a Zeng Shen who killed someone. Right and wrong have their own public judgment. I am sending this message to clarify my intentions."

### Chen Jitang to Fly to Qiongzhou Today to Take Office

### Control Yuan's Annual Meeting Concludes; Yu Youren Emphasizes That the People Need Peace; Reminiscing About the Martyrs Only Brings Shame and Sorrow

[Our Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] The Control Yuan's annual meeting for the 38th year, which opened on the 12th and lasted for 18 days, concluded successfully on the 29th. The closing ceremony was held at 4:00 PM, presided over by President Yu Youren, who delivered a closing speech. After the meeting, photos were taken for memory. During his speech, Yu emphasized that peace is needed by all the people of the country. In the past, all the supervisors of the Control Yuan issued a peace declaration, advocating sacrificing everything to achieve peace. The Control Yuan's spirit of sacrificing itself to seek peace has moved many people. In the future, we should continue to uphold this spirit to seek peace, and pay attention to the reasons why peace cannot be achieved at any time. As long as we have breath, this ambition cannot be slackened in the slightest, so as not to fail the people of the country. Today's opening ceremony coincides with the Memorial Day of the Yellow Flower Mound Martyrs on March 29. Reminiscing about the martyrs brings many feelings. We are really sorry for the martyrs. In the past, many martyrs did not hesitate to sacrifice their blood and heads in exchange for the Republic of China, which shocked the world and the whole country at that time. But what has China been like in these years? Thinking about it makes people feel ashamed and sad. Yu finally quoted his saying in Chongqing, "The Yellow Flower Mound is not only the Yellow Flower Mound of the seventy-two martyrs, but the Yellow Flower Mound of the whole country," and continued to extend it, hoping that everyone should have a Yellow Flower Mound, not forget their own Yellow Flower Mound, and strive for their own Yellow Flower Mound. Yu's closing speech was sincere and pertinent, and the supervisors applauded several times, especially when he mentioned "as long as there is breath, this ambition cannot be slackened" and "everyone should strive for their own Yellow Flower Mound," the applause lasted for several minutes without stopping.

### Battles Continue in the Suburbs of Anqing; The Communists are Reinforcing and Determined to Win; Sansha Is Occupied and Used as a Springboard to Cross the River

[Our Wuhu, 29th Dispatch] The fighting in the suburbs of Anqing continued on the original positions from the evening of the 28th to the forenoon of the 29th. From the afternoon onwards, the fighting gradually eased due to the repeated reconnaissance and bombing by the air force. Before evening, a certain elite national army took the Dongshan ship from downstream via Wuhu to reinforce. At the same time, it was reported that a large number of communist troops were moving south on the Hefei-Tongcheng Road, so the military judged that the communist army's plan to capture Anqing seemed not to have changed slightly due to the heavy casualties in the past week.

[Our Wuhu, 29th Dispatch] From Shankou Town near Anqing, westward through Diangang Village, Huayang Town, Wangjiang City to the Zhoujiawan area, a large number of communist troops suddenly arrived on the 28th. In order to take the initiative, the national army originally stationed at the bridgehead in Huayang Town had to withdraw to the south bank of the Yangtze River. On the night of the 28th, the communist army divided into several groups and took wooden boats, braving the naval gunfire along the coast between Shankou Town and Zhoujiawan, to continue to steal or forcibly cross to Shangguanzhou, Tiexinzhou and other places, seemingly intending to use these sandbars as springboards to carry out a landing on the south bank. Currently, in addition to continuing to block and attack, the national army has strengthened the defense from Guichi through Dongliu to Pengze in the east. (Another telegram) Shangguan, Tiexin, Peiyuan and other sandbars are still occupied by the communist army. The Jiangshun ship of the China Merchants Bureau passed by here on the morning of the 28th, was attacked by the communist army and returned, with many deaths and injuries. Also, Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison, inspected the river defense between Beijing and Wuhu on the 29th and gave instructions to Commander Zhang.

[Our Nanchang, 29th Dispatch] More than a hundred communist soldiers captured by the national army in the suburbs of Anqing on the 28th have been escorted to Xunyang, including one Japanese.

[Our Hankou, 29th Dispatch] Military News: (1) As of noon on the 29th, the situation in the Anqing battle has not changed significantly. (2) The Chinese army in Hubei recovered Hanchuan today, and the downstream of the Xiang River can be reopened. According to traffic sources: navigation to Anqing is expected, and the Baofeng and Mingxing ships left Hankou for Shanghai on the 29th.

[Our Xiaogan, 29th Dispatch] There are no large communist troops within fifty miles of the northeast of Macheng. The order of the county seat has returned to normal. The traffic car between Hankou and Macheng now only goes to Songbu, and the bus between Hankou and Huang'an is unobstructed.

[Our Jiangyin, 29th Dispatch] The main force of the communist army in Jingjiang is gathering, and it is expected that Bafenggang will inevitably have a battle for it.

### Tea Party of the National Assembly Representatives' Shanghai Friendship Association; Exchanging Opinions on Peace Talks; Advocating Convening a Temporary National Assembly

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday (29th) at 3:00 PM, the Shanghai Friendship Association of National Assembly Representatives, in commemoration of the anniversary of the implementation of the Constitution, specially convened representatives in Shanghai at the Shanghai Municipal Council at No. 295 Tanggu Road to hold a tea party. 48 representatives, including Xu Jilao, attended. Pan Gongzhan, Lin Yin, and Dai Tianqiu were elected as temporary chairmen. The meeting dispersed at 7:00 PM. During the meeting, the representatives exchanged detailed opinions on the current peace talks issue. Pan Gongzhan stated that the result of this peace talk is related to the people of the whole country, not just a simple dispute between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Therefore, its consultation conditions must widely solicit the public opinion of the people of the whole country and be carefully considered. Moreover, after the implementation of the Constitution last year, the government was produced by the National Assembly. If the government accepts conditions such as abolishing the Constitution and abolishing the legal system, it will not only damage the dignity of the National Assembly, but also violate public opinion and have no legal basis. Lin Yin, a representative from Taiwan, Wang Xinghua, a representative from Rehe, Dai Tianqiu, a representative from Northern Jiangsu, Yu Yufei, a representative from Songjiang, Zhang Xiaojing, a representative from Zhejiang, and others spoke successively, all believing that the spirit of the Constitution must be maintained and the representatives of public opinion must be respected. Yu Yufei, a representative from Songjiang who had just come to Shanghai from Beiping, also reported in detail his personal experience of local peace in Beiping, pointing out the arrest of Xu Huidong and Zhang Yinwu, who strongly advocated local peace before the communist army entered the city, and the communist party's strict restrictions on the people's freedom of life, as a warning, hoping that the people of the whole country would strengthen their vigilance.

Final Decision - Two Proposals: (1) Send a telegram to the government and telegram to national representatives everywhere to respond in unison, requesting that in accordance with the resolution of the legal signing procedures completed in last year's congress, "a temporary national congress be convened before December 25, 1950," announce the convening of a temporary national congress, and launch a joint signature from national representatives in Nanjing, Taiwan, and Guangzhou to determine the date of the meeting. (2) In the name of the Shanghai Friendship Association of National Assembly Representatives, send a telegram to the government, stating that peace talks must be within a reasonable and legal scope to seek peace of equal status, and the four principles of political democracy, economic equality, social stability, and freedom of life must be the premise of the agreement. It was decided to appoint Pan Gongzhan, Jiang Jianbai, Dai Tianqiu, Yu Yufei, and Lin Yin to be responsible for drafting the above telegram, which will be officially sent out on the 30th. The association will also collect information and schedule another enlarged meeting next week to continue discussing the peace talks issue.

Editorial

### Prospects for the European Parliament

As foreign ministers from countries such as Britain and France depart for Washington to attend the signing ceremony of the Atlantic Pact, representatives from ten European nations are meeting in London to discuss the formation of a "European Parliament." A British Foreign Office spokesperson stated, "This meeting is overshadowed by the successful atmosphere of the Atlantic Pact, and I am confident that it will achieve the same success." This optimistic tone sufficiently demonstrates that the long-brewing "European Parliament" has reached a concrete stage.

While the world's attention is focused on Washington, closely watching the signing of the Atlantic Pact and the movements of diplomats from various countries, the holding of the ten-nation European meeting, moving towards the broad path of European unity, is also worthy of significant global attention. As the English-language China Mail commented yesterday on the "European Parliament": "Representatives from European countries are currently gathered in London to discuss the detailed measures for organizing the European Parliament, which is an unprecedented event in European history. Although there have been alliances and leagues in the past, most were temporary combinations driven by military and political reasons, often exploited by a leading country. But today, the situation is different, as countries place greater emphasis on the self-awareness of shared cultural and moral heritage." This shows the closeness of relations between European countries at this meeting.

The participants in this meeting include representatives from ten countries: Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, and Ireland. Except for Spain, Portugal, Germany, and Switzerland, it can essentially represent the entirety of Western Europe. Therefore, any resolutions passed at this meeting require the approval of the Western European Union's Council of Foreign Ministers to be valid. Regarding the internal organization of the "European Parliament," according to a United Press report from London on the 28th, the parliament will be composed of ten representatives from each of the ten countries. For the sake of common interests, it will adjust the political and economic relations between European countries at any time, but will not discuss issues of a military nature. Therefore, generally speaking, the European Parliament is essentially an agency of a European United Nations. When discussing any issue, it will adopt an open discussion format, thereby influencing public opinion in European countries and gradually bringing it into alignment. The difference is that the parliament only has the power to make recommendations, but does not have the power to legislate or execute. However, this organizational issue has not been completely resolved, and Britain and France do not have consistent opinions. France has submitted a plan to the parliament advocating a "bicameral system," but Britain's plan advocates a unicameral system, which should only have the power to make recommendations and no other powers. The members of the European Parliament will all be appointed by their respective countries, and the seat of the parliament will be in Strasbourg, France. In fact, the opinions of Britain and France are largely similar, and it should not be difficult to reach an agreement in the ten-nation meeting.

If the "European Parliament" can adopt the structure of the United Nations and become a European United Nations organization to promote unity, cooperation, peace, and prosperity among Western European countries, there is nothing theoretically objectionable to it. However, as the East-West Cold War intensifies due to the signing of the Atlantic Pact, the drafting of the charter for the "European Parliament" inevitably gives people the impression of adding fuel to the fire of the Cold War. Therefore, whether the European Parliament can be established this summer is likely to remain a question.

First, the idea of a European Parliament has been around for a long time, with Churchill being the most ardent advocate. It is not a new idea. In particular, most Western European countries do not allow Communist Party members to be among their representatives, which easily arouses suspicion. The so-called "European Parliament" may simply be another anti-communist organization. For example, the British government will send members of the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, and the Conservative Party as representatives to participate in the European Parliament, but will not appoint any Communist Party members. This will undoubtedly be met with disapproval in British public opinion. Therefore, people do not hope that the European Parliament will be realized immediately, and there will be twists and turns in the future selection of representatives, which may become hidden reefs in the future of the "European Parliament."

Second, since the "European Parliament" does not allow Communist Party representatives to participate, the Soviet Union will surely propagate widely to the world that it is another step towards leading Europe towards division and war, and will incite the people of Western European countries to rise up in opposition. Today, the Communist Party forces in European countries are growing stronger and cannot be underestimated. According to a report by Christian Science Monitor reporter Truman, the Communist Parties of Western European countries will all stand out. French Communist Party leader Thorez, Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti, and British Communist Party Secretary General Pollitt will all publicly declare that once Western European countries go to war with the Soviet Union, the people of each country should welcome the Red Army to enter their territory, or provide support, or participate in sabotage, as a response. Under these circumstances, the establishment of a "European Parliament" is likely to cause some turmoil within Western European countries, hindering its smooth birth, and the domestic situations in Italy and France are particularly worrying.

Third, the question of whether West Germany should participate will inevitably lead to a debate at the conference. From Britain's standpoint, whether it is good or bad, Germany is ultimately a part of Western Europe and is the industrial center of Western Europe. If it is not allowed to participate, it will reduce the significance and function of forming a "European Parliament." But in France's view, allowing West Germany to participate in the "European Parliament" is tantamount to raising Germany's status and accelerating Germany's restoration, which is ultimately a threat to France's security. The divergence of opinions between Britain and France is likely to delay the birth of the European Parliament.

In addition, there is the language problem, which adds another difficulty to the future of the "European Parliament." Therefore, we believe that if the current East-West Cold War does not stop, any plan or organization will lose its meaning. Former British Labour Party chairman Professor Laski recently expressed his views on resolving international problems, advocating the convening of a four-power summit to end the current East-West Cold War. He also said: "I will say to the Soviet Union: The world today is completely involved in a struggle between two ways of life. In fact, you can live according to your way of life, and our way of life is our business, please don't interfere. During the war, we were all weak and could unite sincerely. Today, we have both turned from weak to strong. If we cannot work together, there is absolutely no hope for peace. We are here to provide assurances, even if the world calls this 'appeasement,' we will not care." This passage from Professor Laski is worthy of deep reflection by both the East and the West. If the Cold War does not stop, even if the European Parliament is successfully established, it will be difficult to achieve its mission of promoting peace and prosperity in Western Europe.

### U.S. Large-Scale Aid to China Issue to Be Comprehensively Reviewed by Congress; No Aid to Governments Controlled by the CCP

[United Press International, Washington, 28th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee stated on the 28th that future large-scale aid to the Chinese government must await a "comprehensive review of the situation." The Foreign Affairs Committee made this statement in a report attached to a bill that would extend aid to China until February 15, 1950, allowing China to use the $54 million allocated last year but not yet used. The report stated that this bill "should be seen as a temporary recommendation." The report stated that the allocated funds would only be sufficient to continue the aid program for a few months, but that "it is hoped that the situation will allow for a comprehensive review of the situation in China and the interests of the United States there before the end of this Congress." The Foreign Affairs Committee stated that this review will determine whether the aid program is "necessary and practical." The report stated that the three principles of U.S. policy toward China should serve as the basis for considering the nature and scope of aid to China. These three principles are: (1) The United States continues to support the principle of international respect for China's territorial and sovereign independence. (2) The desire of the American people to continue normal economic and cultural relations with the Chinese people. (3) The United States is willing to "continue economic aid programs to China to the extent that circumstances permit." However, the committee emphasized that "this provision is not intended to aid any Chinese government controlled by the CCP." The report stated that the committee has sought a way to agree on differing opinions on current U.S. policy toward China. "Due to current developments, it is impossible to determine a policy that will accurately reflect the facts in six months or a year. However, it is possible to authorize the use of existing funds within certain limits of policy for a certain period of time. This bill provides for this authorization and its limitations."

### CCP Intensifying Pressure on Northern Border of Vietnam; Operating Alongside Viet Minh Forces

[United Press International, Paris, 28th] According to a report from the French military headquarters in Vietnam on the 28th, the Chinese Communist Party has intensified its pressure on the northern border of Vietnam and is actively operating alongside Viet Minh forces.

The French military headquarters also denied that eight French battalions were surrounded there. It is reported that the French command has dispatched reinforcements to the area.

"Several medium-sized attacks" have occurred in northern Hanoi Province.

[United Press International, Paris, 29th] According to semi-official sources, the CCP entered Mongay, a coastal city in northern Tokyo Province, at 4 p.m. on the 27th.

The defending forces resisted intermittently in the fortress until the reinforcements arrived, and it is reported that 30 people were killed in action.

[United Press International, Paris, 29th] Vietnamese semi-official sources say that after the CCP's determined attack on French garrisons in the north, the Viet Minh rebellion is spreading to the southern provinces. According to reports from Ha Nam, the CCP has "invaded" Vietnam from Guangdong Province, and government troops in the area (north) are being reinforced. According to reports from Saigon (south), fighting is still ongoing in Cochinchina, and the French air force is "suppressing" the rebels.

### Kang Yi Clan Leaders Engage in Internal Strife; Deng Deliang's and Sun Fang's Troops Confront Each Other Near Luoge; He Guoguang Says He is Determined to Handle the Matter Peacefully

[This newspaper, Chongqing, 29th] Fighting broke out near Luoge, a key transportation route dozens of miles from Xichang. This has now been confirmed by He Guoguang, deputy director of the Pacification Headquarters and commander of the Xichang Garrison Command. He Guoguang also decided to leave Chongqing on the 30th and fly to Xichang to return to his post. He said: Deng Deliang's troops were dispatched from Xichang and Yuexi, numbering three platoons, and have been dealt with by Sun Fang's troops. The two sides are still confronting each other. Deng, who is of Han ethnicity and 23 years old, is the son of the former Pacification Commander Deng Tingxiu. After Tingxiu's death, the troop affairs were taken over by Deputy Commander Sun Fang (Sun is also the leader of the Yi ethnic group's delegation visiting the capital and a National Assembly representative). Deliang was transferred to the Infantry Party School for training. After completing the training at the end of last year, he was appointed by the Ministry of National Defense as a Major General Pacification Commander. However, because Deng's mother, who is over 60 years old, constantly interfered in troop affairs, the Yi ethnic group issued a telegram opposing it. The Ministry of National Defense recently upheld its original decision, appointing Sun as the acting commander and Deng as the regimental commander. Deng's mother ignored the orders of the Ministry of National Defense, privately stamped official seals, and posted them throughout the Ning District, announcing that Deng had been officially appointed as commander. Deng's mother is stationed in Luoge, personally directing the Yi people to resist Sun Fang, while Deng remains in his old home in Ganshan Camp. He Guoguang said he is determined to be tolerant, handle the matter peacefully, and avoid escalation to prevent local chaos. In addition, Wu Peiying, deputy commander of the 24th Army stationed in Xichang, has come to Chongqing via Chengdu and will go to Ya'an to meet Liu Wenhui.

### Marshall Plan Second Phase Appropriation; U.S. Republican Party Strongly Obstructs; Military Aid Plan Still Under Government Discussion

[United Press, Washington, 29th] Senate Republicans on the 29th obstructed the government from passing the $5.5 billion second phase of foreign aid bill quickly. Republican leader Wylie said that the Republican Party decided to delay any "hasty" attempt to pass the bill, which may be "shelved at midnight" this Saturday. He said, "We must explore all the information about this plan, its cost, its effect, and all related matters. This is the only way we can make the American people understand this matter."

[Reuters, Washington, 28th] A State Department spokesperson stated today that the estimated figures reported in the newspapers regarding the military aid plan were all incorrect, as no final decision has been made on this matter. Furthermore, the representatives scheduled to sign the Atlantic Pact here on April 4 will study the establishment of the North Atlantic Nations Committee in accordance with Article 9 of the Pact. President Truman met with U.S. Budget Director Pence today to discuss the expenses needed to aid Atlantic Pact nations and other countries with military supplies. It is generally expected that the estimated figures will be produced within this week.

[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] Well-informed sources predict that the expenses for military aid to signatory countries will be $1.25 billion, and the expenses for aid to other friendly nations may reach $500 million. Meanwhile, Republican Senator Furculo today severely criticized the military aid plan to Europe and the Marshall Plan aid to Europe. It is said that overlapping aid plans are bankrupting the American economy. France is impoverished due to repeated wars, and the United States will be impoverished due to fear of war. The North Atlantic Treaty cannot prevent the United States from being drawn into war, nor can it stop war. Democratic Senator McMahon told Furculo that such arguments should be presented at the New York Peace Conference attended by the Communist Party.

### Official Results of National Local Elections; French Political Situation Trends to the Right; Communist Party Loses 147 Seats

[United Press, Paris, 29th] The French Communist Party issued a statement on the 29th, denouncing French power, stating, "If the election law were fair and democratic, the Communist Party could have won 350 seats." According to official figures, the Communist Party won only 37 seats.

[United Press, Paris, 28th] The French Ministry of Interior stated on the 28th that the Communist Party had "undoubtedly failed" in this local council by-election. Observers believe this will be a meaningful preview of the possible results of the 1952 general election. In addition to the Communist Party's defeat in this election, it also proves that (1) the center-left coalition government led by Prime Minister Guy Mollet still possesses the power to balance the political situation. (2) The Gaullist People's Rally and other right-wing parties have seen an increase in popular support.

The official results of this election are as follows (including the two elections on the 20th and 27th):

Communist Party　184　37

Socialist Party　429　279

Radical Socialist Party and its　291　277

Affiliated Parties

People's Republican Party　111　110

### U.S. Secretary of Defense; Inaugural Declaration; Decides to Expand Strength as Backup for Diplomacy

[Reuters, Washington, 28th] The new Secretary of Defense, Johnson, was sworn in today.

To achieve this goal, it is necessary to unite the Army, Navy, and Air Force to serve the country. With God's help and guidance, we will never allow American youth to be dragged into the tragedy of war again. We desire a peace with honor and freedom, but should aggression occur, we are confident that we have the strength to stop it. I take office as the head of national defense with this confidence to serve the country.

The cost of radar installation in Canada will be roughly the same as the $161.1 million approved by the United States for this year's radar installation expenses. According to sources, neither the United States nor Canada currently intends to attempt to set up a "radar screen" facing the Soviet Union in the Canadian Arctic Circle, as the cost of this installation would be enormous and its implementation would hinder other defense deployments.

[Reuters, Washington, 28th] U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for United Nations Affairs Rusk stated recently that when the United Nations General Assembly reconvenes in New York on April 5, there are still four major items that were not discussed during the meeting in Paris last year that need to be discussed, namely (1) the disposition of Italian colonies; (2) the treatment of Indians in South Africa, (3) the status of Spain under Franco, (4) freedom of the press.

He expects the General Assembly to discuss Poland's proposal to impose economic sanctions on Spain. The United States' position on this matter has not yet been determined. He also expects that this session will last for four to five weeks.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Italian Foreign Minister Sforza met with Secretary of State Acheson today to discuss the Atlantic Pact and the issue of former Italian territories. Sforza hopes that the United States will support the proposal to place Libya, Eritrea, and Italian Somaliland under Italian trusteeship, as the handling of these colonial issues is of great concern to the State Department, because the United States maintains the important Wheelus Air Base in Libya, which is within bombing range of Eastern Europe. The Italian Foreign Minister pointed out that in this regard, if Libya is placed under Italian trusteeship, the United States will still be able to maintain the base. However, whether the United Nations agrees to this measure is questionable.

### American Archaeologists; Decide to Search for Underwater Treasures

[Associated Press, Boston, 28th] American young archaeologist Balman is determined to search for the 2,000-year-old Dragon Palace Treasure. The treasure is on the Mediterranean seabed, three miles from the town of Mahdia, near Tunis, French North Africa. According to legend, a Roman yacht loaded with treasures stolen from Greece sank there.

Mrs. Popova replied: Thank you, I don't dare to accept. British representative Labor leader Miss Sutherland also joined the verbal battle, saying that calling the information provided by the Soviet representative inaccurate was already very polite.

The delegation composed of Mei Yifan, Jing Ying, Li Xiong, Shen Xin, Wang Zhenbai, and Su Xueren, six representatives from the Shanghai Postal Administration, who are negotiating with the Chinese Communists on the issue of full postal service, has now been approved by the central authorities as the issue of remittances has been resolved. They are scheduled to take a special China Aviation plane from Shanghai to Beiping tomorrow (31st). They have already telegraphed the Chinese Communist authorities in Beiping, and once consent is obtained, they will depart as scheduled. After arriving in Beiping, they will begin discussions on five detailed rules for postal service: (1) locations for exchanging mail, (2) types of parcels (goods), (3) principles for remittances, (4) unified postage fees, (5) personnel safety, so that full postal service can be fully implemented as soon as possible.

Adjustment of Exchange Rate Between North and South

[Another Report] The original exchange rate between the Nationalist-controlled area and the Communist-controlled area was set at 22 gold yuan for 1 renminbi. It is learned that the various remittance banks in this city received a notice from the Beiping Communist side yesterday, stating that from today onwards, the exchange rate will be adjusted to 28 gold yuan for 1 renminbi.

Furthermore, since the start of the dredging work between this city and Beiping and Tianjin some time ago, it has not yet reached a smooth stage due to the failure to resolve some technical issues. Currently, in addition to the New China Trust and Savings Bank, which has accepted remittances to and from Beiping and Tianjin, and the China Industrial Bank and the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, which have accepted remittances to and from Beiping, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, the Jin Cheng Bank, and the Salt Industry Bank, which have been designated by the Chinese Communists and approved by the authorities, are still actively preparing. According to the New China Bank, the amount of remittances is still limited to 100,000 yuan. Most of the remitters are students paying tuition fees or providing living expenses, with an average of about 2 million yuan remitted to Beiping and about 500,000 yuan remitted to Tianjin every day.

The preparations have been completed and will be officially implemented from April 1. Inspection personnel have also been assigned separately. Both the Postal and Telecommunications Bureaus have received the above notice from the Garrison Command. However, in order to avoid conflicting with the freedom of communication granted by the Constitution, a random inspection method will be adopted for the inspection of postal and telecommunications services. The scope of random inspections will also be reduced, limited only to letters, parcels, and telegrams sent to areas controlled by the Communist army, such as North China, Northeast China, and Shandong.

### After the Announcement of the New Economic Program, Municipal Finances and Tax Revenues Still Need Improvement; Merchants Deliberately Delaying Tax Payments; Approved to Be Penalized According to the Index; Deputy Director Qian Answers Questions from Our Reporter

[Our Report] Since the announcement of the New Economic Program, the impact on local finances, especially whether municipal finances can be improved, has been of utmost importance. At the same time, as a result of the accelerated devaluation of currency, many taxpayers are willing to endure the penalties for overdue tax payments in order to offset and obtain extra profits in terms of gradually rising interest rates. This issue is particularly serious. Our reporter specifically interviewed the municipal finance authorities on three major issues: (1) the state of municipal finances after the announcement of the New Economic Program, (2) the handling of merchants deliberately delaying tax payments, and (3) the plan for the reorganization of municipal finances in the future. Deputy Director Qian Jianfu of the Finance Bureau provided the following information:

(1) The State of Municipal Finances After the Announcement of the New Economic Program: After the announcement of the New Economic Program, the relevant implementation rules have not yet been formulated, especially in terms of local finances, there have been no concrete instructions. Before long, the entire social and economic situation has changed, so in terms of municipal finances, it is difficult to talk about what impact it has had. Taking the program itself as an example, the only things that involve local finances are that "agricultural tax" is completely allocated to the local level, "land, tobacco, and liquor tax" and "special business tax" are also returned to the local level, and the restrictions on special local taxation are relaxed on the principle of not harming national taxes. The agricultural tax year should begin in October of this year, so this allocation will not help the current predicament. Shanghai is not a production area for land, tobacco, and liquor, so the income is very small. Under today's situation, it is feared that it will be difficult to expect much income from special business tax. As for local special taxation, although new tax sources can be opened up, it is not easy to open up new tax sources. On the one hand, the tax burden capacity of citizens should be taken into account, and on the other hand, attention should be paid to the tax sources that can be opened. Therefore, this method cannot be effective in an emergency. However, the local financial system is completely determined by the central government. The current economic situation is changing, and a new cabinet has been established. The original economic program seems to have lost its timeliness. It is hoped that the central government can give in-depth investigation and close cooperation, and then the financial situation of this city may be improved.

(2) The Problem of Merchants Deliberately Delaying Tax Payments and Gaining Profits from Penalties: This situation is unavoidable in the period of rampant usury. However, the bureau has already submitted a request to the government for approval to separately determine the calculation method according to the cost of living index for "late payment fines," in addition to the central government's mandatory regulations that cannot be changed for "late payment fines," so that citizens cannot escape their due obligations, and they cannot take advantage of the opportunity to obtain illegal interest. On the one hand, it has also suggested to the central government several months ago that the fines for various tax laws should not be rigidly stipulated so that local governments can have room for flexibility to control taxpayers and tax revenue, so as to realize a fair and reasonable tax policy.

(3) The Plan for the Reorganization of Municipal Finances in the Future: Today, local finances cannot exist independently from all other factors, and the changes in the entire social economy are rapid and drastic. Shanghai is an international city, and its exposure to external turbulence and internal factors is particularly complex. Local financial institutions have no control, so in terms of income, they must follow the rules and advance according to the law, while in terms of expenditure, it is like a dike that has been breached, and the impact has not yet ended. Therefore, the future municipal financial situation can be said to be extremely dangerous, with few comprehensive solutions. Because the entire economic situation is facing the most dangerous stage, the local government cannot be safe alone, especially Shanghai, which cannot form a "green" measure in finance. From a personal point of view, a new cabinet has been established, and there must be another new plan for the entire economy. At that time, if the currency value can be slightly stabilized and prices no longer rise sharply, and everything is on the right track, then the municipal finances may be slightly revived.

Deputy Director Qian also stated that Director Tian has worked hard for the past two years, to the point of coughing up blood, and must take a considerable period of rest. He has been appointed to temporarily take over the duties, which is purely a matter of private help, and everything should still follow the instructions of the superiors.

### Grand Gathering at Zhongzheng Park to Celebrate Youth Day; Over 20,000 Self-Defense Youths Inspected Amidst Military Music; Various Leaders of the City Attended to Give Speeches and Encourage Them

[Our Report] Yesterday was the Sixth Youth Day and the Memorial Day for the Bitterly Sacrificed Martyrs. Various circles of the city held a celebration and self-defense youth inspection meeting at Zhongzheng Park at 10 AM. A total of 2,455 officers and 23,496 team members attended the inspection. The presidium of the meeting was composed of Wu Guozhen (represented by Chen Liang), Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Chen Daqing, Mao Sen, Zhang Xiaosong, Cao Peizi, Zhou Lixing, and others. The inspection ceremony began at 10:30 AM, with Tao Yishan, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Garrison Command, serving as the Commander-in-Chief, and Chen Daqing as the Chief Inspector. The inspectors rode in three jeeps, circling the field once. The sun shone brightly, the military music was uplifting, and the team members were full of spirit and their formations were extremely magnificent. Then, a celebration meeting was held. After the ceremony, Tao Yishan led all the young team members to loudly recite the oath to defend Greater Shanghai.

The Nation is the Root, Humanity is the Flower

At 10:40 AM, Mayor Wu, as the Chairman, delivered a speech on behalf of Secretary-General Chen Liang: "Youth Day is set on the Memorial Day of the Seventy-Two Martyrs, and its significance is extremely important. The spirit of the martyrs, with their ideals and courage, is enough to move heaven and earth and make ghosts and gods weep. From the Huanghuagang Uprising to the Wuchang Uprising, the May Fourth Movement, and the eight years of the War of Resistance, young people have led the national struggle. Young people are the root of the nation and the flower of humanity. At this time of turmoil, only young people can save the nation. Our ideal should be democracy, freedom, equality, and peace. We must not only attack all reactionary forces, but also completely eliminate reactionary forces. We must emulate the spirit of the Seventy-Two Martyrs, and believe that final success will surely be ours."

Uniting Youth to Build a Great Wall

Subsequently, Garrison Commander Chen Daqing delivered a speech, roughly stating that today, when the government is seeking peace and reform, young people should assist the government in maintaining security and order, and he hoped that they would strive for the cause of national construction and revolution.

Pan Gongzhan then took the stage to give a speech, roughly stating: "Today, more than half of the people in China have lost their freedom. Not only can they not criticize or oppose things, but they are also forced to say what, believe in what, and live a life that has lost its soul. To protect freedom, we must first have a strong fortress. This fortress is to unite energetic youths to build an iron Great Wall in order to protect our free life. If we unconditionally accept the demands of the Communist Party and live a Soviet-style life, the 450 million people will not agree."

Following this, Fang Zhi delivered a speech, and Zhao Guangze, a student from the Northeast who had fled to Shanghai, reported on his experience of fleeing from the Northeast. Finally, they shouted slogans and the meeting adjourned.

The meeting passed four telegrams to compatriots across the country, Acting President Li, President He, Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party, and the entire government peace negotiation delegation. The telegrams to Acting President Li, President He, and Mao Zedong are recorded below:

Telegram to Acting President Li

To Li, Acting President of the Presidential Palace in Nanjing, and He Junjian, President of the Executive Yuan: Since March, you have devoted yourselves to peace, running around and appealing tirelessly, with painstaking efforts and sincere intentions, which the whole country admires. However, as the peace talks are about to begin, the Communist Party is broadcasting the appointment of representatives, willing to start peace talks with the government, while gathering troops, stationing them along the Yangtze River, and fiercely attacking Anqing, Yihui, and other places, actively preparing to cross the river, which makes people doubt their sincerity for peace talks. We sincerely hope that the Communist Party can suddenly wake up, be sincere, stop all military actions, and jointly seek the realization of a true and comprehensive peace. However, if the Communist Party disregards the lives of the people and invades the south of the Yangtze River, we, the compatriots of Jiangnan, in order to seek the safety of our lives and the protection of our property, can only rise up in self-defense and demand that the government protect the borders and defend the people. We would rather be shattered as jade than preserved as tile, and vow to support the national policy of preparing for war and seeking peace under your leadership, and strive for a glorious and comprehensive peace together. We respectfully submit this telegram, and respectfully ask for your consideration. The Sixth Youth Day Celebration and Self-Defense Youth Inspection Meeting in Shanghai, Yin Jian, bows.

Telegram to Mao Zedong

To Mao Zedong, Chinese Communist Party, Beiping: For three years, the people have suffered beyond endurance. Now, the government is sincerely seeking peace, and you, sir, also value the will of the people, and have appointed representatives to begin peace talks. Your wisdom is admirable, and it shows that people have the same desire for peace and aversion to war. However, the premise of peace talks is that both sides must be sincere, consistent in word and deed, and sincere with each other. Only then can a true peace be achieved. However, upon investigation, the recent actions of the Communist Party are completely different. The closer the date of the peace talks, the more urgent the military offensive; the closer the start of the peace talks, the more urgent the attempt to cross the river. Anqing, Yizheng, and other places have been attacked, and the hearts of the people on the south bank of the Yangtze River are increasingly filled with fear and indignation, unable to live in peace. To call this peace talks is to treat the lives of the people as mere grass. How can this be allowed? Who in the world will believe it? In the midst of confusion and grief, we sincerely hope that you, sir, can value the lives of the people and immediately cease all military actions and abandon preparations to cross the river. Otherwise, the peace talks will be mere empty words, and war will inevitably break out again, with no peaceful day, plunging the people into misery and the country into an irrecoverable situation. The responsibility for destroying peace will be pointed out by the whole country, and seen by all. You, sir, are wise and will not do such a thing. We earnestly hope that you will rein in the horse on the edge of the cliff, comply with the will of the people, turn swords into ploughshares, and turn hostility into harmony. Furthermore, peace talks must ensure the independence and integrity of the country and the freedom of the people's lives. Partial division, settling of old scores, and rule by violence will only plunge the country and the nation into disintegration, sow the seeds of long-term turmoil, and leave behind hidden worries. How much greater is the concern? We also hope that you will carefully consider this, then the country will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate. The Sixth Youth Day Celebration and Self-Defense Youth Inspection Meeting in Shanghai, Yin Jian, bows.

The Civil Division of the Court announced the verdict the afternoon before last: Main Text: The defendants shall jointly and severally compensate the plaintiff with 500,000 gold yuan, and shall return to the plaintiff twelve bottles of 200,000 units of penicillin produced by a certain pharmaceutical factory, four bottles of 30cc of calcium glucose produced by the same factory, and five bottles of 150 doses of liver extract produced by a certain pharmaceutical factory. Provisional execution is permitted. According to Kong, at about 10 AM on November 17th last year, she took a British-owned Route 20 trolleybus from Shaanxi North Road to Nanjing West Road station to get off, but before her foot touched the ground, the ticket seller Wu Jinhu (the first defendant) rang the bell and drove the car, and although Kong shouted loudly, Wu ignored her, causing Kong to be run over by the car. She was sent to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment, where she was diagnosed with brain concussion and a split in her left lower limb, with a comminuted fracture of the tibia. After several operations, although her life was saved, she was left disabled. Her husband teaches at St. John's University, and his income is meager. This accident has made their financial situation even more difficult, so she borrowed money from friends for medical treatment, and borrowed various injections and medicines from a certain pharmacy to barely survive the dangerous period. As for the criminal part of this case, the Criminal Division of the Court has sentenced the defendant to imprisonment, and he is currently appealing.

### Various Industry Unions Strengthen Work Enrollment Measures; Suspension of Work for Those Who Refuse to Join; Must Still Join the Union to Resume Work

[Our Report] In order to implement the provisions of the sixth meeting of the first session of the Municipal Council to strengthen occupational measures and the implementation measures for punishing those who do not join the union, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has formulated a method for various industry unions in Shanghai to strengthen worker membership, referring to relevant central laws and regulations, and considering the actual needs of the time. It promotes that workers in all industries in the city who have not yet joined the union must join the union in accordance with the law, and the bureau has submitted it to the municipal government for approval and promulgation. The main points of this method are as follows: (1) All workers in all industries in this city who are employed and have existing union organizations should apply for membership within one month after the promulgation and implementation of this method. New workers in the industry should apply for membership to their industry union within half a month after starting employment. (2) For those who have not joined the union, the union group leader and all members of each group should be responsible for persuading and introducing them to join the union. If they refuse to accept, they should report it to the union for handling. (3) The union should pay attention to publicity work and carry out welfare facilities within a possible scope. (4) The union should notify workers who have not joined the union in writing, setting a time limit for joining the union. If they have not joined the union after the time limit has expired, various persuasion methods may be used to promote their membership. If personnel are sent to the workplace to persuade them, the union should first notify the employer in writing, and the number of persuasion personnel should be limited to three, but the persuasion should not hinder production order. (5) If a worker resists joining the union after persuasion, the union council will warn him to join the union within a time limit. If he still does not join the union after the time limit has expired, the union council may, depending on the circumstances, impose the following punishments: (1) Report it to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for review and handling. (2) Submit it to the general membership meeting for handling in accordance with Article 10 of the implementing rules of the Trade Union Law (i.e., suspension of work), and still report it to the Bureau of Social Affairs for approval and execution. (6) The period of suspension of work in the preceding article shall not exceed one month at most, and the union may divide it into several grades according to the severity of the circumstances and stipulate it in the constitution to facilitate execution. (7) In order to investigate the membership status of workers, the union may hold a general inspection once a year regularly or when necessary. (8) Employers and their trade associations should assist the union in persuading workers to join the union to enhance labor-management cooperation. Employers should earnestly comply with the suspension of work punishment given to workers who refuse to join the union after approval by the Bureau of Social Affairs; otherwise, they will be given appropriate punishment. (9) Workers who have been suspended from work should apply to the union for membership immediately after the expiration of the suspension period, and then they can resume work. If they are willing to join the union during the suspension period, they can apply for membership while the union notifies the employer to allow them to resume work, and report it to the Bureau of Social Affairs for record.

### Tragedy of Mistakenly Eating Pufferfish Roe: Three Deaths, One Rescue

[Report from this newspaper] Li Zhifa, a Sichuan native residing in a straw shed at No. 157 Linjiazhai, Xinzaozhou Road, earned his living by collecting swill. Yesterday morning, he went to Pudong to collect two buckets of swill, unaware that they contained a large amount of pufferfish roe. He brought them home, where Wang Xinglong, a Yunnan native and neighbor at No. 4, saw it and thought the roe would be a delicious addition to his meal. He instructed his wife, Wang Li, to scoop up some of the roe from the swill bucket with a strainer. Around 4:00 PM, they cooked and ate it. Besides Wang and his wife, Wang Li, Shi, who lived with the couple (her husband was a police officer at the Laozha Police Station), also ate it. Later, Li Zhifa arrived and also tasted a few bites. By around 7:00 PM in the evening, Shi first showed signs of poisoning, with numbness all over her body, almost to the point of death. At the same time, Wang Xinglong's poisoning was too severe, and medicine was ineffective. He passed away shortly after. The hospital reported the incident to the Penglai Road Sub-bureau, which dispatched officers to investigate and discovered the truth. They went to Li's place and found that he was also poisoned, suffering from severe abdominal pain. They rushed him to Renji Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, he had eaten only a small amount and was saved after emergency treatment.

### Pork Prices Are So High They Are Like Luxury Goods: Consumption Continues to Decline; Only One in Every Hundred Citizens Eats a Pound of Meat Each Day

[Report from this newspaper] The consumption of pork in the city has greatly decreased recently. According to investigations, a total of 76,462 pigs were slaughtered in the city in January of this year, but this number sharply decreased to 26,200 in February. There are no definite statistics for this month yet, but it is known that the average daily number is around 600 to 700, which is even less than in February. The main reason for the decrease in pig slaughtering is the worsening military situation in northern Jiangsu. Transportation has been cut off north and south of the Yangtze River, and the supply from Xuzhou, Huai'an, Taizhou, and other counties, which are the largest sources of pigs, has almost completely stopped. The city is now relying solely on the villages along the Jinghu and Huhu railways. Secondly, under high prices, the living standards of ordinary citizens are declining daily. For most civilians, pork has become like a "luxury item," something they can only look at but cannot afford. There are probably many people who "haven't tasted meat for three months." This can be further proven by last year's pork consumption. In August of last year, over 87,000 pigs were slaughtered. During the early stages of price controls in September, consumption reached a record high of over 100,000 pigs during the Mid-Autumn Festival. In October and November, the price controls and market prices became disconnected, and meat vendors had no profit to make, so the number of slaughtered pigs decreased to over 56,000 and over 49,000, respectively. In December, the price controls were removed, and the number immediately increased to over 86,000. Compared to the past, the situation is indeed getting worse. Based on the current daily slaughter of 700 pigs, with an average of 80 catties per pig, that amounts to over 50,000 catties in total. With over 5 million citizens in the city, on average, only one in every hundred people can eat one catty of pork per day.

### Caohejing to Add a Leisure Spot: "Kangjian Garden Farm" to be Completed Around Qingming Festival; Pavilions, Terraces, Towers, and a Small River Outside; More Than Ten Apartment Buildings Stand Tall

[Report from this newspaper] With the spring sun shining brightly, people enjoying spring outings are becoming increasingly active. Yesterday was the Huanghuagang Memorial Day, and government agencies and schools were closed. The Caohejing Road in the western suburbs of Longhua was filled with carriages and horses. Except for Cao Garden, which is not open this year because it is being used by troops, Huangjia Garden, Guanshengyuan Farm, Longhua Temple, and other places were crowded with men and women. The spring outing season is gradually unfolding. This year, another "Kangjian Garden Farm" has appeared next to Caohejing Road. Construction has been going on recently and is scheduled to be completed around the Qingming Festival to attract a large number of tourists. The scale is similar to Bansong Garden. It is said to have been invested by Baogin Xuan. Its unique feature is that it combines the facilities of a farm, a park, and housing under the principle of "improving health." In addition to restaurants, rockeries, and other pavilions, terraces, and towers, the largest project is the artificial diversion of water from Caohejing River to form a small river about a mile long. There are modern yachts in the river, and more than ten small apartment buildings stand beside the river. Behind the apartments, tea trees, fruits, vegetables, and various flowers are planted everywhere. It is said that the apartments will be available for long-term or short-term rental as soon as they are completed. Tourists who stay there can enjoy all the facilities and fresh food on the farm. This is indeed one of the newest methods of attracting customers in the city this year.

### Discharged Soldier Deng Wenbin Coerces a Young Woman to Cohabit; Forges Military Documents

[Report from our Wuxi, 28th] Wang Rendi, a young woman from Huishan, is currently twenty years old. Since childhood, she had been engaged to Ding A'er, a resident of the same village. Unexpectedly, in March of the 35th year (1946), Deng Wenbin, a discharged soldier, moved into Wang's home. Seeing that Rendi was beautiful, he seduced her in June of the same year. He then forced Wang's father, Genxiang, to terminate the engagement with the Ding family. Afterward, he lured the girl to Nanjing and rented a house to cohabit with her at No. 39 Pingshi Street. It was not until September of last year that Genxiang and his wife found out and rushed to Nanjing, taking Rendi back to Wuxi. A month later, Deng came to Wuxi again, intending to make Rendi continue to go to Nanjing to cohabit with him. However, Rendi had already expressed her unwillingness to go again, and her will was very firm, and her parents also supported her extremely. Deng had no choice but to ask his friend Yi Wenhai (currently the special head of the transportation company of the independent regiment of the 28th Army) to write to the County Police Bureau, ordering Rendi to go to the bureau for mediation, but it was unsuccessful. On the 2nd of this month, Deng went to Wang's home in Huishan again, took out a forged military document from the General Headquarters of the 32nd Group Army addressed to the Wuxi County Police Bureau, and showed it to Rendi, claiming that he was Deng Wenyie's younger brother and threatening to take adverse action if she did not obey his wishes. Wang had no choice but to report to the inspection team of the city defense headquarters on the 26th, along with her mother, Yang, accusing Deng Wenbin of rape and coerced cohabitation. Captain Guo, after receiving the report, carefully examined the military document in detail and found many suspicious points, which were obviously forged. The document stated: (1) According to the report of Deng Guangbin, battalion commander of the third battalion of the first regiment of the military unit, Wang Rendi, the daughter of Wang Genxiang of Yanjiapeng, Huishan, was married in March of the previous year and cohabited in Nanjing. In November of last year, she suddenly absconded, taking a large amount of gold, silver, and clothing. After many inquiries, it was learned that her mother, Wang Yang, was hiding her at home, intending to destroy the family. The report requested that the headquarters pursue her, etc. (2) After summoning Xiao Benhuai, Huang Bolian, Huang Bintuan, and Shan Yunti, the matchmakers and witnesses at the time of the marriage, they proved that it was true, and they also verified the documents. Wang Yang and Wang Rendi, mother and daughter, were escorted to the military law office of the headquarters in Nanchang for interrogation. In the afternoon, the team summoned another defendant, Yi Hai, for questioning. According to his confession: he did not know Deng Wenbin at first, but he was introduced to him later and tried to ask the police bureau to summon Wang to the bureau for mediation. Wang firmly refused. At that time, he told Wang: Deng is a soldier, and if she does not obey his wishes, there will be adverse consequences. He did not know anything else. The team has now detained Yi Yuanhai and is continuing to send people to investigate the truth of the case. Today, the Wang mother and daughter filed a complaint with the local prosecutor's office, requesting that the defendant be punished according to law.

Now the case has become a situation of "a lot of thunder, but little rain." The two singers, Shen Lifang, etc., who were traveling with him, were released on bail on the 27th. As for Hua Zhichun and other three employees of Lixin Cloth Factory, because they are more suspected, they are still temporarily detained for interrogation.

### National Bank Fixed-Amount Bank Drafts; China and Communications Banks Issue Simultaneously

[Report from this newspaper] In order to remedy the insufficiency of cash circulation, the Central Bank decided a few days ago to issue bank drafts in four denominations of 5,000, 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000. It is learned that each bank draft must have the joint signature of two responsible persons from the competent department, so it is impossible to fully meet the needs and issue as many as required.

In order to remedy the defect, the National Bank has approved China and Communications Banks, two of the National Bank's institutions, to simultaneously receive fixed-amount bank drafts from the Central Bank, which will be issued simultaneously after being signed and sealed by the responsible persons of the two banks. The amount of fixed-amount bank drafts that the two banks receive from the National Bank is limited to the balance of the two banks' next-day deposits at the National Bank. The requests of other commercial banks and firms will not be considered for the time being due to technical difficulties in signing and sealing.

According to a responsible official of the National Bank, the fixed-amount bank drafts have two characteristics: (1) They are regarded as cash. (2) They are limited to circulation in this city. Currently, the fixed-amount bank drafts sent to the National Bank by the Central Printing Factory are still limited to the 50,000 denomination, and the rest are still being printed and sent for use one after another. A few days ago, the cashier section of the National Bank's business bureau mobilized its staff to carry the signature-style seals of the cashier section's assistant manager and section chief to stamp each one. However, the cash is still issued based on the next-day deposits of each bank and firm. In the future, if there is a need for a large amount of money and cash is not needed for several weeks, the fixed-amount bank drafts will be issued and circulated in the form of de facto large-denomination bills.

Also, regarding the news reported yesterday that the Central Bank will issue 10,000-yuan banknotes, a responsible official of the National Bank told reporters that he had not heard of this news.

### Rice Prices Soar; Special Japonica Reaches 86,000

The rice market reopened for trading yesterday after the holiday. Because all goods had seen a sharp rise the day before, prices also rose sharply. The early market was the most buoyant, rising sharply by 14,000 to 15,000. The later market saw a slight decline due to tight money and slow digestion. White japonica at the North Market closed at 83,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 13,000 compared to last Saturday. Special japonica and thin rice were both 82,000 yuan, each rising by 12,000 to 13,000 yuan. Total arrivals at the two markets were 7,967 stones.

Edible Oil

Prices soared quite sharply. During the Monday holiday, all goods rose sharply, and mineral cargo owners also tried their best to push up prices. Soybean oil broke the 500,000 mark, reaching a high of 520,000 yuan, closing at 510,000, a rise of 100,000, or more than 20%. Rapeseed oil closed at 440,000 yuan, up 80,000 yuan. Jilong rapeseed oil directly knocked on the 600,000 mark, and soybean cake also rose sharply by 8,000 yuan.

Flour

Sharp rise of half. Because all goods outside the market rose sharply yesterday and the day before, and yesterday was a holiday for all banks and firms, it was generally expected that the money market would be tight today, and people were generally bearish. All brands of flour were unsustainable from the morning opening and retreated step by step until closing. Laoche opened at 32,000 yuan and closed down 250 yuan. Bingchuan made 30,450 yuan.

Grains

The market was surging. Soybeans rose sharply by more than 20%. Chebeans once knocked on the 90,000 mark, but in the later market, traders' positions were quite tight and retreated by 2,000 yuan. Raw kernels are still in short supply and also rose by 20%. Sesame Street's digestion is extremely smooth, and cargo owners held on, rising sharply by 40%. Other corn and red sorghum all rose.

### Land Dispute Issues: Lawyer Tang Wushi Answers

Zhu Yihuai asks: I currently have a land dispute that is being negotiated. The evidence presented by the other party is only a filing registration form of the inspection contract. However, the value of the inspection contract seems to have been ruled in previous precedents by the former Supreme Court that the effect of the inspection contract is very small. Now I cannot handle this dispute because I do not have access to the relevant precedents. I hope your lawyer can provide guidance!

[Answer] The inspection contract mentioned in the letter probably refers to the tax contract. Tax contracts are only proof of tax payment for administrative purposes and are not proof of ownership. The transfer of real estate requires the signing of a written document (Case No. 1308 of the Supreme Court in the 21st year of the Republic). Tax contracts are not a necessary condition for the establishment of private rights relations (Case No. 1308 of the Supreme Court in the 21st year of the Republic). Whether real estate property rights can be opposed to third parties is not determined by whether the sales contract has been taxed and whether it is an official document (Case No. 149 of the Supreme Court in the 5th year of the Republic). I don't know if the precedents cited above are sufficient?

### Excerpts from Letters from Various Parties

(1) Telegram from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters: The case of soldiers attempting to forcibly occupy civilian houses has been forwarded to the military police and constitutional law enforcement office and the 9th regiment of the military police for detailed investigation and prevention.

(2) Letter from the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau: Regarding the citizen Wang Jihang's letter requesting the removal of garbage in Yuanchang Lane, Liling Road, Hongkou, the cleaning team reported that the garbage collector assigned to the lane had resigned, and the new collector was unfamiliar with the work, resulting in some accumulation. It has now been completely removed, and it has been instructed to pay attention in the future.

(3) Letter from Shanghai Inland Waterworks Company: The water supply equipment installed at No. 1781 Longhua Road is a private self-funded installation and is not the so-called affordable water tap. A staff member has been sent to contact the relevant Baojia chief to apply for another public installation in accordance with the regulations.

### Job Openings

The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Office of the China Vocational Education Society has recently been entrusted by a factory to seek one neon light technician and one neon light worker, one glass-blowing worker and one light bulb vacuum worker; it has also been entrusted by a house on Julu Road, Route Paul Beau, to find one female tutor, who must be a graduate of a normal school and have a good foundation in English to be qualified. Those who wish to apply can go to No. 80 Yandang Road to discuss in person.

### Postal Q&A

(Answer to Mr. Shi Zhongyuan's question): (1) Money and banknotes must not be sent in ordinary letters or registered express letters. Banknotes should be sealed in insured letters and registered registered letters. (2) The postal service's current responsibility for sealing and sending banknotes is limited to those who are aware of the situation. (3) If banknotes are sealed and sent in ordinary letters or registered express letters, if discovered by the postal service, a fine will be charged twice the remittance rate of the destination bureau.

(Answer to Mr. Li Bingren's question): (1) After inquiring with the resident customs, it was said that small American electrical meters can be imported by mail if they are indeed for private use and their value does not exceed US$50. Otherwise, an import license must be submitted. (2) All mailed parcels must be inspected by customs. (3) If needle and iron products are domestic products, they generally only need to have the customs seal affixed by the resident customs to be released.

(Answer to Mr. Wan Lihua of Jiashan): (1) Postcards can be purchased from the local post office. (2) If it is inconvenient to buy postcards because your hometown is far from the post office, you can use hard paper or sturdy paper materials to imitate them according to the size and style specified by the post office and affix postage stamps. The postcards can also be used. The dimensions of the postcards are as follows: the length is limited to 10 cm to 15 cm, and the solidity is limited to 7 cm to 10.5 cm.

### Rent Should Not Follow the Index

— A Spectator

From the beginning to the end of the War of Resistance, and from victory to the present day, the increase in rent has indeed lagged far behind the increase in prices. Therefore, landlords have been continuously demanding rent increases. In the past, the municipal government and the municipal council have repeatedly approved appropriate adjustments. Recently, landlords have been actively seeking rent increases again. According to reports, the municipal government seems inclined to allow calculations based on the cost of living index, but believes that the base should be lowered.

The reasons put forward by the landlords so far have not deviated from the following three points:

(1) Rental income is not enough to maintain the expenses of real estate companies.

(2) Rent lags behind general prices, affecting the repair of old houses, affecting investment in new construction, and affecting the housing of the city's residents.

(3) General prices are constantly rising, but rent is not allowed to be adjusted proportionally, which is unfair.

As for adjusting rent according to the cost of living index, in addition to the above three reasons, it is said to be for the sake of "once and for all," to avoid disputes caused by this problem.

We are very sympathetic to the inconvenience suffered by landlords whose funds are frozen in real estate due to their past investment mistakes.

We want to express even more sympathy and admiration for the employees of real estate companies who are poorly paid and live in hardship because of the limited operating income. We also admire them for being considerate of the landlords and loving the landlords. In many harmonious labor-management relationships, they demonstrate the best virtues and are especially worthy of respect.

However, we completely disagree with the above three or four opinions put forward by the landlords, because the reasons they put forward are completely untenable. Moreover, for the sake of the city's industry and commerce and all citizens, we want to issue an appeal, asking landlords to respect reason, consider morality, and not seek selfish gain. In particular, we want to ask the municipal government agencies in charge of rent issues to withdraw their consideration of this method.

Let us first examine the above four reasons cited by the landlords one by one, and we will see that they are untenable.

General prices are rising, and real estate prices are also increasing proportionally. Therefore, the interests of landlords are exactly the same as the interests of hoarding goods. Although the assets of the industrial and commercial sectors also increase with rising prices, the industrial and commercial sectors also take commercial risks on the other hand, so they are even more miserable than the real estate industry.

(2) The business of real estate companies is essentially only of two kinds: one is to invest funds in real estate, and the other is to manage real estate. The former, which has productive significance, is now considered not to be the time for real estate investment, so there is no need to invest. Just like a month ago, the silver industry could not buy or sell gold and silver, so it stopped operating. As for managing real estate, it has no productive nature. If you store antiques and jewelry in a safe deposit box, the owner has to pay rent. Therefore, real estate owners should also pay out of their own pockets to maintain the livelihood of the employees of the real estate management company. It would be best if they can pay from their operating income. If it is insufficient, they should take it out themselves, according to reason and logic.

(3) Land prices can be compared with commodity prices, because they are both property. The current land prices have not lagged behind commodity prices by much. Even if there are slight differences, it is a normal phenomenon in the uneven increase of general prices, and one cannot demand rent increases to compensate for it.

Rent cannot be compared with commodity prices. Because it is of the same nature as interest. Before the war, the interest rate was between five and one cent, but now the official interest rate is fifteen cents. This is an increase of 15 to 30 times compared to before the war. Therefore, to solve the rent problem, one can only keep pace with the multiple increase in interest rates. There is no reason to enjoy special rights and increase beyond the multiple of the interest rate.

If, in order to achieve a permanent solution, the rent problem is to be fundamentally solved, the only way is to let the rent keep pace with the multiple increase in interest rates. Then, first of all, the rent should be set at a base rate according to the ratio of 3 million legal tender to 1 gold yuan. From then on, it should keep pace with the multiple increase in interest rates. However, this can only be adjusted once, because it is really embarrassing to increase the official interest rate to such a high level today. Then, the rental income will inevitably decrease relatively as the value of the currency continues to plummet.

As for the impact on the repair of old houses, it is indeed a problem. However, real estate is property, and repairing houses is protecting one's own property. One should repair one's own property, and others have no such obligation.

Low rental income means that real estate investment is unfavorable. Funds flow to profitable places, so new investment in housing decreases accordingly, which does have an impact on future housing. This responsibility should be borne by the government authorities that issue currency. It is wrong to ask tenants to be responsible by raising rents. This is like being punched by the neighbor to the east and retaliating against the neighbor to the west.

If the authorities value the housing problem in the future, then there is only one way out: to provide loans to real estate companies to build new residential houses, which is the right thing to do.

It is an obvious fact that, apart from the high price of goods, everyone in the industrial and commercial sectors is facing great difficulties. If industry and commerce were prosperous and the purchasing power of the citizens increased, then the real estate industry would naturally have the opportunity to demand a considerable rental income. But now, the land prices of the real estate industry and the prices of goods related to industry and commerce have both risen. The general profits of industry and commerce are extremely low, and many even suffer losses. The real estate industry alone wants to increase rental income. This demand is unfair no matter what.

If we consider it from the perspective of social interests, then among the five million people in this city, real estate owners account for no more than one-thousandth or even one-ten-thousandth or two-ten-thousandths? Real estate owners have already obtained the benefits of rising land prices, and they still demand the benefits of increased rental income. And to let 999 out of 1,000 or 9,999 out of 10,000 people and the industrial and commercial sectors, under the increase in commodity prices and the increased burden of living, pay tribute to the real estate industry again, this is tantamount to robbing the poor to help the rich!

### Democracy Cup Football Kicks Off, Samsung Plays with Nine Players, China Art Opens Successfully, Today's Second Act Huaguang vs. Pan Team

The Samsung football team lost 1-3 to the "dark horse" China Art in the opening match of the Nanshi Democracy Cup yesterday due to insufficient manpower. The first half was 0-2, and both goals were penalty kicks. Samsung was short of Gao Baozheng (Gao was registered in both Samsung and Jiuzhou, as the only player to cross teams) and Wu Jiabang was visiting his ancestor's grave, so they played with only nine players and were heavily threatened by the opponent. After half an hour, Lu Qingxiang arrived late (due to late handling of the Road Bureau's salary roster) and became ten players. However, bad luck came, and Zhang Qichang and Yue Renxiao were judged to have committed fouls in the penalty area, and Chen Longquan of China Art successively scored two penalty kicks.

After changing positions, Samsung still had only ten players, but they tried to attack. After a long stalemate, Zhang Zhaopeng of China Art fouled, and Xiao Ziwen also scored a penalty kick to pull back a goal. After half an hour, Jia Linshu arrived, and Samsung finally had eleven players, but there was only a quarter of an hour left, and it was already at the end of its strength. Unfortunately, Hu Nanhai scored another goal at this time, so Samsung's momentum was gone. China Art won 3-1.

The second act of the Democracy Cup, Huaguang vs. Pan Team, will be held at 4:00 pm today at the Nanshi Stadium. The referee is Chen Fubin, and the linesmen are Tan Rongsheng and Yan Yougeng. Huaguang has always been known for its liveliness and good fighting skills, but Wu Qixiang and Fu Yin have a desire to retire today due to some misunderstanding. Huang Jiabang, the owner of Huaguang, is sending people to persuade them, and it is still uncertain whether they will play. However, if Qixiang does not play, Huaguang will lose its chance to play football in the Democracy Cup, because the team representatives unanimously passed a resolution at the meeting that players registered in the senior group must not change teams. The Pan Team has made rapid progress recently, and has been actively updating its lineup after being promoted, and is worthy of competing with Huaguang.

### French Tennis Players to Compete in Hong Kong

[Hong Kong Air Mail] Du Bei, the sixth-ranked tennis player in France, and Ananren Wen Su, the eighth-ranked tennis player in France, will go to Hong Kong to compete at the beginning of next month. The Hong Kong side has scheduled five matches.

### Hong Kong Grass Court Tennis Singles Final, Ye Guanxiong Wins Championship, Da Xu Unable to Do What He Wants, Loses in Straight Sets

[Hong Kong Air Mail] The grass court tennis singles championship match between Xu Weipei and Ye Guanxiong was completed on the 29th. Ye Guanxiong was better in skill and won the championship with 6-1, 7-5, 8-6. Although Da Xu struggled several times, he was unable to do what he wanted.

The game started with Ye Guanxiong serving, and it went smoothly, winning three consecutive points. In the fourth point, Ye started to play tricks, catching Xu off guard with a short ball that forced Da Xu to rush to the net. Although he managed to save it, he was intercepted by Xiao Ye and hit back, and Da Xu surrendered, losing the first game. After that, Ye only lost three points and won two more games, leading 3-0. Afterwards, Da Xu fought hard and took back one game after a tie. Xu's personality is originally slow to warm up, and Guanxiong took the opportunity to win fiercely, and soon won four consecutive games, leading 5-4. In these four games, Ye only lost six points in total. At this point, Da Xu knew that he had to fight hard, and the "competition feeling" suddenly appeared. He proceeded step by step, not putting it down at all in a desperate momentum, and actually only lost one point, chasing back to a 5-5 tie. This was Da Xu's second masterpiece the day before yesterday, the first time Da Xu won a game with only one point lost. But the good times did not last long. After that, Guanxiong also proceeded step by step, so the older Da Xu, although still fighting hard, also ran out of skills. As a result, Guanxiong won 7-5 again, winning the second set. The results of this set were very close. Ye won 39 points, and Xu also got 34 points, which took 26 minutes to complete. In the whole set, Ye and Xu each served an "ace" ball once, but Da Xu still had two double faults, one of which was originally a good ball, but was ruled an error, and the re-serve fell on the net, which was really not worth it.

Third Set Although the number of games in the third set was more than in the second set, the excitement was not as good as in the second set. At the beginning of the game, Ye Guanxiong showed great power, breaking Da Xu's serve, and then only lost three points, leading 3-0 straight. Da Xu won the fourth game. After Ye won 4-1, Da Xu suddenly showed his standard performance, winning three consecutive games, and chasing back to a 4-4 tie amid the frequent applause of the spectators. In the ninth game, Ye's power recovered again, taking back a net gain. The tenth game was no less than a matter of life and death for Da Xu, but he used both soft and hard tactics, and really struggled to gain control of the situation, taking the lead everywhere, but still tied the game five times, and then grabbed back a 5-5 situation. At this time, Da Xu's prestige was very high, and he even won a 6-5 second lead, but Guanxiong's technology was amazing. After striving for a net gain in the twelfth game, he immediately took the lead and won two more games, winning the third set with 8-6. Once again, he became the singles champion of Hong Kong. But Da Xu also did not show weakness, and saved the set point once before surrendering. This set took 34 minutes to complete. In this last set, Ye won a total of 53 points, Xu got 41 points, Ye had as many as four "aces", while Da Xu had no aces, but had three double faults. Counting the whole game, Ye scored a total of 120 points, served seven "ace" balls, and had no double faults. Xu scored a total of 84 points, served one "ace" ball, and served seven double fault balls.

### Re-examining the Gains and Losses of the Railway Team and China Aviation Team

— Qi Gong

[Our Dispatch] The Mayor's Cup, which has been held for three years, has a new champion this year. The Railway team defeated the China Aviation team with a score of 3-0 in the final on Sunday, winning the Mayor's Cup. The ninety-minute match was tense, but lacked brilliant performances. Except for the Railway team's clear and crisp third goal, the other two goals were virtually gifts from the China Aviation team. This shows that neither team had exquisite shooting skills, further proving that Shanghai is gradually facing a shortage of talented shooters.

The Railway team's strength, both offensively and defensively, was superior to that of the China Aviation team. Their skilled short-passing tactics posed a significant threat to China Aviation's defense. Although the offensive was fierce, there was no fast-paced shooting prowess. After seventy-five minutes of attacking, China Aviation rashly adjusted the positions of Jin Jiabiao and Jin Chuanhan, placing Jin Jiabiao, who had been out of practice for a long time, in the center forward position, lightly moving far away from the defense. This allowed the Railway team to clearly pass the ball three times and pass it twice, and Zhang Jie scored the third goal in an open position. If China Aviation had not gifted the first two goals, it could be said that the Railway team only actually won by one goal.

In terms of offense, Zhang Jie's scurrying and Lu Qingxiang's headers both threatened the opponent. However, they relied solely on short passes for offense, which resulted in fewer achievements and less efficiency. The two wings were not coordinated, and the forwards' shots were weak, so the China Aviation team's goal was more alarmed than endangered.

In terms of defense, Gao Baozai was the mainstay, hindering Xu Zuguo's activity, limiting the China Aviation team's offensive to within the penalty area, and making it difficult to cross the line. The four defenders cooperated tacitly, controlling the midfield. Except for Liao Xiong's fumble of Gao Xiuqing's high shot that rebounded off the goalpost, there were few thrills. This was due to the China Aviation team's weak offense, reflecting the Railway team's solid defense. With a more skilled performance, the Railway team got a first taste of the Mayor's Cup.

China Aviation put all their hopes on the national team, and Zhuang Wenquan and Jin Jiabiao rushed back to join the team. If Gou Tianfa could have come, there would still have been hope of winning. Unfortunately, Xiao Tian did not come, leading to a second-place finish. China Aviation's defeat was due to improper lineup arrangement, and even more so due to unexpected mistakes that gifted two goals, essentially defeating themselves first. The first two goals were ultimately due to Chen Xiaoping and Jin Chuanhan's mistakes and carelessness, and the third goal was caused by Jiabiao's far outreach. With the loss of three goals, even if Xu Fusheng had three heads and six arms, he could not have saved the situation.

When China Aviation was penalized with a free kick outside the eighteen-yard box, Xu Fusheng should have been solely responsible for covering the angle of the goal. Xiaoping should have been at the right side, thirteen yards away from the goal, to cover half of the goal. If the kicker shot to the right, there would have been an angle to head out a high ball, and an angle to intercept a low ball with his foot. This is the measure that Wu Qixiang and Li Tiansheng should take to help the goalkeeper deal with free kicks penalized outside the penalty area. China Aviation did not do this, but instead had Xiaoping and Fusheng stand together on the goal line, jointly bearing the responsibility of guarding the goal. This was a mistake. In fact, Xiao Ziwen kicked towards the center, hitting where they were not guarding, not only leaving Fusheng dumbfounded, but also Xiaoping clueless, rushing to use his hand to try to stop the ball from entering the net, resulting in the first loss. (Note: According to the rules, if the ball is touched by hand and still enters the goal, it is still counted as a winning goal, and a penalty kick may not be awarded. If the ball does not enter the net, a penalty kick must be awarded). If Fusheng were left to handle the sudden change alone, unless the kicker had a clever angle, there would have been hope of breaking through the goal.

From this, we can see that if an inside defender assists the goalkeeper in guarding the goal, the kicker can aim the ball at the corner of the goal guarded by the inside defender, possibly making him helpless. However, shooting a low ball will not break through the goal.

The second goal was Jin Chuanhan's misunderstanding of heading the ball away. Fusheng had already left the goal, creating an opportunity for Wu Binghao. If Fusheng had shouted "My ball!" when leaving the goal to meet the ball, Xiao Jin would not have had this misunderstanding. The third goal was the mistake after the changing of positions between Da Jin and Xiao Jin. Da Jin had left the defense, resulting in an empty gap, allowing Zhang Jie to perform a crisp shot from five yards away from the goal. In terms of defense, Zhuang Xie and Xiao Jin had already done their best. China Aviation rashly assigned Chen Yuwei to the left wing, which was not his job. The distance was too great, making it difficult to reach far, and the front wing was broken. Without coordinated wings to cooperate with the offense, although Xu Zuguo sprinted like a horse freed from its reins, it was difficult to break through Gao Baozheng's stronghold alone. Although Gao Xiuqing tried hard to explore the way, the offensive was limited to the center, and advancing and retreating only reached the Railway team's penalty area line. Only after Chen Yuwei and Xu Zuguo switched positions did they have a slight offensive, but the morale had not recovered, and the overall situation was gone.

Referee Zhang Le, and linesmen Ni Xiaoben and Lu Shunde, had fair refereeing. The whole game had no rough play. It was unavoidable to have occasional illegal collisions. In the stadium, a fan asked me why Zhang Le did not penalize Chen Xiaoping's handball with a penalty kick, but instead ruled that China Aviation had lost a goal. I also told him that according to the above rules, such a ruling should be made.

### On Reciting Poetry

— He Zhongbing

A few days ago, I saw an article in this publication discussing folk songs, which reminded me of reciting poetry.

Since the May Fourth Movement liberated poetry from the shackles of old forms, there has been recited poetry. However, until the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was never noticed, and therefore it was unable to develop and progress. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, many poets walked out of the palaces of art and threw themselves into the countryside. After contacting the broad masses of the people, they saw the gap that had always existed between themselves and the people. They began to feel the mistake of admiring and playing with emotions behind closed doors in the past. Therefore, on the one hand, they strengthened the combativeness of the content of the poems, and on the other hand, they changed the style and vocabulary of the poems, making them popular and making them understandable to people when they were recited in public, using this as a tool to promote and inspire the emotions of the people. Since then, recited poetry has gradually become popular, and it has established indelible achievements in the vast front and rear.

From the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan to the present, due to the needs of the objective situation, recited poetry has developed even more greatly. Now, from dozens of people's recreational or artistic gatherings to evening parties of more than ten thousand people, almost all have programs of poetry recitation, and there has also been significant progress in terms of form and technique. In the past, it was one person reciting aloud, but now it has gradually transformed into collective recitation and dialogue-style rotation recitation. Recently, there have been costume recitations and, similar to operas, poetry dramas in which one person recites and many costumed actors perform actions. This form of gradually combining poetry and drama can be said to be the highest form of development of recited poetry. In terms of art, it is extremely perfect; in terms of life, as for the deep feeling and great effect of recited poetry, I think anyone who has participated in large-scale student evening parties in recent years knows this.

The various forms of recited poetry were not created by one person or a few people. It is due to continuous experimentation, continuous improvement, and especially the collective creation of thousands of young students over the years that it has achieved such results today. Moreover, its development and popularity today are not the achievements of one person. Its growth and growth are to meet the needs of the times and meet the demands of the public.

Poetry was originally a tool for conveying emotions. The value of a poet lies in his ability to integrate his own emotions with the emotions of the public and sing the love and hate of the public. Now, due to the development of recited poetry, poets, reciters and listeners have been able to connect more closely together, so the future of recited poetry is immeasurable.

### The New Art of Rejuvenation

— Jiang Yu

Women are often very annoyed by their prematurely aging appearance. Some women are only in their forties, but because of years of hard work or worry, their faces are covered with wrinkles, and their foreheads are even densely covered with "tram tracks," making people suspect that she is an old lady in her seventies or eighties. Although beauty treatments can provide temporary relief, they cannot withstand close scrutiny and cannot last for many days. But now, the United States has cosmetic surgery that can be done in just two or three hours to completely eliminate wrinkles on the face and forehead, making oneself twenty years younger. This surgery is painless and, once used, can be maintained permanently, without the hassle of constantly applying makeup.

Mrs. Keller, in her book "Women's Life," describes her experience of undergoing cosmetic surgery. She is fifty-one years old this year, and psychologically she still feels very young and full of life, but her appearance looks very old, which makes her feel very painful. After discussing it with her husband, she decided to find a reliable doctor to perform cosmetic surgery.

After all the preparations were made, she entered the hospital, put on a white gown, and the nurse gave her a local anesthetic injection and two sleeping pills to calm her mind. During the surgery, she woke up twice and chatted with the doctor. The entire surgery took two and a half hours, and she did not feel any pain.

The next day, she went home. Four days later, she went to the hospital again to remove the gauze bandages on her head. Four days later, some of the stitches could be removed; on the fourteenth day, all the stitches were removed. Mrs. Keller, after two weeks, was completely a young and beautiful woman in her thirties.

Especially important is that all the characteristics of her face have not changed at all. She has not become another person; she has only become herself twenty years ago.

The steps of this new type of cosmetic surgery are as follows: First, inject a local anesthetic. Second, the doctor makes a semi-circular incision on the skin behind the ears and above the hairline. This scar will be hidden when the hair grows out in the future. Then, he uses special instruments to pull the skin of various parts of the face backward, and sews it up inside the hairline where necessary according to the natural structure of the facial muscles, so that the tension of the skin is appropriate and does not leave any wrinkles. In short, the fundamental principle of the surgery he performs is to remove all wrinkles on the forehead and face and maintain youthful smoothness; and the places where the surgery is performed are all inside the hairline, so after the hair grows out, no scars can be seen at all. At the same time, because the surgery only moves the skin part and does not move the muscle tissue and bones at all, it has absolutely no impact on the shape and characteristics of the entire face.

Of course, this rejuvenation surgery still only belongs to the scope of beauty and does not really make people live longer. But when a middle-aged woman looks in the mirror and suddenly sees herself returning to the youth of twenty years ago, what a great psychological boost this is for her! From this, her spirit is doubled and her health is improved, which is naturally to be expected.

### Overseas Road Talk

— Chen Qiji

In Sverdlovsk, Russia, there are roads paved with crushed jade, topaz, beryl, and malachite. These are the most beautiful and precious roads in the world.

In Monterey, California, USA, there is a road paved with whale bones. So far, this is still the only road in the world paved with animal bones.

In the Netherlands, there are roads that use oil-soaked reed mats as the road surface. Reed mats can filter water, which is very suitable in countries below sea level.

In a certain place in India near a sugar factory, there is a road paved with molasses, measuring fifty miles long. It is said that the construction method is very simple, just mix molasses with water and spread it flat, then add a layer of coarse sand, and the road surface is very strong, allowing heavy freight trucks to pass.

### Songhua Mushrooms and Pig Roe

— Chen Zuogao

Recently, I often read Mr. Chen Yixian's articles on eating in this publication, and I feel they are very flavorful. Driven by interest, I will also briefly describe the local flavor of my hometown, Pinghu.

Pinghu County is located in Zhaopu Town, surrounded by mountains, so the valley is named Jiufeng. Mount Chen and Mount Huang in particular are often seen in the poems of local sages. The place produces Songhua mushrooms, which are about the size of copper coins. Every spring and summer, they grow under pine trees on the mountainside. They are naturally nurtured without artificial planting, so the output is very small, no more than ten pounds a year. Local gentry regard them as delicacies, especially those made by the nunneries in my hometown, which are the most unique. The method is to fry the mushrooms with pure oil, and the taste is fresh and rich, far exceeding Zhangjiakou sesame paste. I remember when Yuan Hanyun was alive, he once held a Qianlong Yifu note, written in regular script, and sent it to my painter brother Julai, asking for this mushroom, praising it as the most beautiful taste. Even Mei Cheng's sweet meal is probably not an exaggeration.

Also, near the coast of Zhaopu, there are many pig fish, whose roe is edible. Those engaged in this industry mostly gather the roe and wrap it in cloth into a fist shape, and then roast it. The color is like amber. Before the war, each piece was sold for about four or five silver dollars, so there was a considerable profit to be made. The cooking techniques are always kept secret. Those who buy it cut it into thin slices, dip it slightly in white sugar and eat it, and the fresh taste surpasses that of Guangdong water beetles. The smoked roe sold in seaside sugar shops is completely different from this. These two items, one meat and one vegetable, are used to feast on guests. I have not eaten them for a long time. As for the heirloom watermelon-flavored eggs, which are a famous product of Pinghu, watermelons still have famous varieties such as Dezhou Hami, and Sichuan-flavored eggs are also called delicacies; but Songhua mushrooms and pig roe, with their sweet and savory taste, are incomparable. It is a pity that the output is too small, and the name is not well-known.

### Stop Shouting

— Huiling

### The Electric Clock is Slow

— Si Yi Si

Our city will switch on and off the lights three times before curfew as a warning. Then, the electric clock powered by electricity will also rest three times a day. Although these three times are only a few seconds, a few seconds a day, a few minutes a month, and almost a scene a year. By then, all the electric clocks in the city will become thirteen o'clock and strike a messy bell.

### The Troubles of Hiring a Nanny

— Baozhu

In today's life, being a housewife is really not an easy task. The price of firewood, rice, oil, salt, and vegetables rises day by day, making you frown. Not to mention this, even the problem of nannies and elder sisters adds a threat to you.

Nannies do have a very important position in ordinary families. Unlike in foreign countries, where everything is helped by machines, so one can not hire a nanny. We rely on our own two hands to do the work of the whole family. Some people have to take care of children. It is very difficult to cope without a maid. However, hiring a nanny is such a headache! Don't you hear Mrs. Zhang and Sister-in-law Li next door looking for nannies every two or three days?

Before a nanny comes to the door, she first asks how many times a week this family plays mahjong and how much extra money they make. It is difficult to persuade her, saying that this year is not the same as before. We are still worried about eating ourselves, so how can we have so much spare money to invite guests to play cards? However, the wages can be increased a little. In this way, she reluctantly stays. But in less than three days, she comes back to you in a strange manner. It turns out that she dislikes that the things in your family are too nagging and the dishes are too shabby; she says that going to bed at eleven o'clock is too late; in hot weather, she will say that there are too many mosquitoes in your house and she cannot sleep at night. Some even say that they are not used to eating Hukou rice because they are used to eating Du rice.

If you live in a lane house or an apartment, it is even more troublesome. It seems that nannies and elder sisters have to hold a symposium every day, making their own shoe soles in their hands, and their mouths are full of how bad your young mistress is and how strange my master's temper is. Otherwise, they will make an appointment with their companions to go to Baxianqiao to buy foreign cloth today and to visit relatives in Lujiabang tomorrow. When it comes to the day of paying wages, they will inquire about how much money is given in No. 3 and how much is added in No. 6. As a result, Daozi tells you that her mother in the countryside is sick and she has to go back. Two weeks later, you find her washing clothes at the entrance of No. 10.

Even if you finally find someone who is quite capable, you have to accommodate her! She wants to go out three times a week, you dare not say anything to her; she uses twice as much soap as before, you cannot ask her; if you speak to her in a slightly louder voice, she will immediately pull up her apron and glare at you with her white eyes: "You find someone else!"

If you hire a young girl from the countryside, when she first comes, she is honest and very diligent. Although she has never seen a flush toilet and it takes a long time to talk to her, you have to teach her patiently. But after a month, she thinks she knows everything. You will not learn if you teach her again, and you cannot find her when you want to find her. It turns out that she is sitting alone in the study downstairs reading picture books, and the face cream she has applied has not yet dissipated. After another month, on the morning of the day after paying wages, she took her luggage and left silently. She told the cook that she had talked to the young mistress last night. A week later, you remember the pound of wool and ten yards of white bamboo cloth you just bought and want to take them out to use, but unexpectedly you cannot find them after searching all the boxes and wardrobes. This is something I personally experienced.

I have a friend who just hired a wet nurse. She was very flattering to the owner. After a while, she often spoke ill of the old nanny in front of the owner. The owner's things were missing, and she said that the old nanny stole them. Sure enough, the lady found them in the old nanny's box, so she fired her. Later, other items were found missing, and of course they were suspected of being taken away by the old nanny. Little did she know that this wet nurse and the old nanny were in cahoots. She herself stuffed things out one by one, and then split the loot with the old nanny.

Another friend of mine was moving to Nanjing to live, so she took the old nanny with her. At first, the old nanny was happy, but later she insisted on returning to Shanghai. One of the reasons was: "The Shaoxing opera in Nanjing is not as good as in Shanghai."

The most annoying are the "Amas" who have worked in foreign households. Not only do they dislike the low wages of Chinese families, but they also look down on Chinese families. All day long, you can hear them say: "The Missy I used to have often gave me foreign clothes and high-heeled leather shoes;" or: "The children of the family we used to have took two baths a day, no matter how cold the weather was. Chinese families are really dirty."

However, it has to be said that not every nanny is bad, and not every owner is good. Some families, with seven or eight people, hire a nanny, take a basic salary of eight yuan, and have to cook, wash, and take care of children. After finishing, they cannot even eat hot food, and they send cold porridge and boiled water to their stomachs. It is no wonder that people complain. Servants are also people, and they are also for life, for "money." Housewives can only treat them as helpers, but cannot treat them as slaves. They can only let it go where it is possible to be casual. You might as well watch one less movie, do your hair less often, and add one or two yuan to their wages, which can at least reduce some troubles. At the same time, nannies also have to understand the difficulties of the owners. Although there are plenty of wealthy people in Shanghai, there are, after all, a limited number of them; if every family has to be compared with bank managers and yarn factory owners, what can be done?

I think the best way is: ladies and young ladies, also learn to do it yourself more often. The concept of "it's shameful not to hire a servant" in the past must be broken. If you can do everything yourself and are willing to do everything, you are not afraid of the nanny threatening you. Maybe one day, when you can no longer hire a nanny, you have to live your life!
