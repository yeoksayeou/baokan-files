### New Cabinet Possibly Formed Today; Policy Guidelines to be Drafted; Earnest Implementation Based on Four Major Goals

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] After Acting President Li intervened to urge him on, there has been significant progress on the list of the new cabinet members on the 20th, but a final decision has not yet been reached. Negotiations with all parties will continue on the 21st, with the possibility of the cabinet being formed on the 21st. He Yingqin invited Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Zhongxin, Weng Wenhao, and others to meet at his official residence on the morning of the 20th to discuss the matter and spent the entire day on long-distance calls to Shanghai, awaiting replies. It is learned that the ministries of Transportation, Finance, and Justice are still problematic among the entire list of cabinet members. A decision has been made to choose one of Shen Yi and Ling Hongxun for Transportation, while Xu Kan is still being requested to take on the Finance portfolio. There is no suitable candidate for Justice at the moment. Those who have been decided are Li Hanhun for Minister of Interior, Chuan Bingchang for Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sun Yueqi for Minister of Economic Affairs, He Yingqin concurrently for Minister of National Defense, Hang Liwu for Minister of Education, Bai Yunti for Minister of Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs, and Dai Kuisheng for Minister of Overseas Chinese Affairs. However, the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs was the original decision, but since the selection of the Minister of Foreign Affairs is related to national policy, no contact has yet been made with Chuan. As for the seven positions of political committee members, a decision has been made to reserve one or two positions for the Democratic and Youth Parties. The remaining five positions have been decided for Zhang Cui, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhu Jiahua, and Guan Jiyu, with another person under consideration. According to authoritative sources close to He Yingqin on the 20th, He's selection of cabinet members will first avoid the appointment of personal favorites and will also avoid interference, granting He full authority. He emphasizes peace, reduces partisanship, so as not to stimulate the CCP. He's new cabinet originally aimed at transcendence, new people, and new policies. Although the individuals invited are gradually changing, these two principles remain unchanged.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] While the list of new cabinet members is still under careful selection, the policy guidelines for the new cabinet have already been undertaken by those responsible for drafting them under He's direction. The main points are based on the four major goals of "seeking peace, political reform, stabilizing the economy, and securing the people's livelihood," and efforts will be made to avoid complex and redundant wording, aiming for brevity and practicality to facilitate implementation. These guidelines are expected to be drafted within two days and submitted to He. After the list of cabinet members is announced and the new cabinet is declared formed, it will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for a report.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] According to those close to He Yingqin, the work to be undertaken immediately after the establishment of the new cabinet includes the following points: (1) Adjustment of salaries for public educators. (2) Handling of personnel left behind by the Sun cabinet in Guangzhou. (3) Rectification of current financial and economic problems. Furthermore, after the announcement of the establishment of the new cabinet, the important personnel of all ministries and commissions will restore the original office forms of each ministry, and the Executive Yuan will move its offices to the Lixingshe, which is currently being arranged.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party will take the night train to Shanghai on the 20th to consult with members of the party regarding joining the cabinet. After visiting He Yingqin on the 19th, Jiang also paid a visit to Acting President Li on the morning of the 20th. Jiang told reporters that the Democratic Socialist Party's attitude toward joining the cabinet is to first understand the new cabinet's policies so that they can jointly support the perilous situation. Now, He's policies are seeking reasonable peace, but the method of achieving it is still unknown. Therefore, whether or not to join the cabinet will be decided after discussion by the party.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Acting President Li personally visited Xu Kan at 30 Fu Hougang at 10:30 a.m. on the 20th for discussions. Li Hanhun visited Xu at 4:30 p.m., and He Yingqin also contacted Xu by phone at 8:30 p.m. for discussions.

### Post, Telegraph, and Railways Price Increases Postponed

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 20th] The 21st was originally the date for price increases for post, telegraph, and railways. According to Ling Hongxun of the Ministry of Transportation, implementation will be temporarily postponed until the Legislative Yuan has reached a decision on the public utilities price increase proposal.

### First Joint Symposium of Legislative and Supervisory Yuan Members; Decision to Strengthen Ties Between the Two Yuan and Hold Meetings Once a Month Thereafter; Seek Work Coordination to Promote Efforts to Achieve Peace and Reform Politics

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] The joint symposium of members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan meeting in Nanjing was changed to begin on the 20th, and it was decided that it would be held once a month thereafter to exchange opinions on the current situation and to seek work coordination to help the government eliminate corruption and incompetence, and reform politics. The symposium on the 20th was the first. Approximately 300 members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan attended, including Yu Youren and Tong Guanxian. Li Mengbiao was publicly elected chairman. From 9:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., a total of 20 committee members spoke, and their opinions were divided into two points. One was to strive for peace and reform politics, with many criticizing the current unreasonable phenomena. The other was to seek to strengthen the ties between the two Yuan and exert their power. The Supervisory Yuan specifically raised the issue of the Supervisory Law, which restricts the exercise of supervisory power, and requested the Legislative Yuan to support the proposed amendments by the Supervisory Yuan. The speeches of the committee members were very impassioned. Regarding the former, Legislative Yuan member Kong Geng called for unity to start from within, and that peace must have the guarantee of life and freedom. Legislative Yuan member Xu Panqun believed that the state of the nation is due to the non-implementation of the constitution, and that the Central Political Committee and the Central Standing Committee of a single party can make the final decision, which is truly questionable. Therefore, he advocated ending party rule. Xu also discussed whether there are other forces preventing decision-makers from implementing policies, which should be studied. Whether resignation is a form of rest, and the time limit for the Vice President to act as President, he argued, should be considered for "rectifying the position and establishing the name." Legislative Yuan member Niu Jianchu advocated overthrowing the privileged class, and that peace cannot be infiltrated with speculative intentions. He supported overall peace, opposed partial peace, supported fair peace, and opposed surrender peace. Legislative Yuan member Wang Bingjun criticized Sun Ke's cabinet for using national transportation to move gold, silver, treasures, children, and even toilets to Hong Kong, which was outrageous. Supervisory Yuan member Ni Bi explained that in the past, people hated the Communist Party, so they supported the suppression of the rebellion. Now, because the National Army (such as in northern Jiangsu) demands things and even women, the people do not serve willingly, so they hope for peace. The gun-holding class believes that they can still fight, which is an absurd idea. Currently, to seek peace, one must admit defeat. Acting President Li and Premier Sun have both admitted defeat, and the reason for the defeat is the corruption of discipline and the disintegration of the people's hearts. If discipline is not rectified, it will not only be impossible to fight, but also impossible to have peace. Legislative Yuan member Pan Lianfang believed that the powerful families should be overthrown. Representatives from the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan should vote to determine who are the powerful families, and then investigate the source of their wealth. Illegitimate wealth should be confiscated by the state to curb inflation and rising prices. Legislative Yuan member Miao Chunlin believed that the powers of the two Yuan cannot be exercised due to a force with more than 20 years of history obstructing them. He advocated taking the two Yuan as the center, uniting all reform forces, and supervising the Executive Yuan to implement reforms. Supervisory Yuan member Cao Dexuan believed that the Supervisory Yuan has failed the people, and the Legislative Yuan has also failed the people, because the Weng cabinet and the Sun cabinet were both approved by the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, he hoped that the Legislative Yuan would exercise its power of consent with caution in the future. Cao believed that the Kuomintang should eliminate corruption, and the Communist Party should eliminate evil. In the past, when the government suppressed the rebellion, various places supported it. Now, when the government seeks peace, various places also support it, which is opportunism. Some places oppose conscription and requisition of grain, but who would oppose the Communist Party conscripting soldiers and requisitioning grain? Some people oppose American aid, but why not oppose the Communist Party accepting Soviet aid? We here have the freedom to hold joint symposiums, but if we go to the Communist area, even farting will be interfered with. Legislative Yuan member Miao Qiping believed that we should atone for our sins and save the nation. Peace must have power, otherwise we can only kowtow to the Communist Party, which is surrender. Regarding the latter, Supervisory Yuan member Li Zhengle said that disciplinary cases sent out three months or even three years ago still have no outcome, so the Supervisory Law must be amended. Legislative Yuan member Li Shijun said that the Supervisory Yuan can impeach and eliminate corruption, and the Legislative Yuan can eliminate incompetence through the system. The two Yuan should have a standing liaison organization, which can be organized by representatives from each Yuan. Legislative Yuan members Wu Wangji and Liu Zhendong both opposed this kind of organization, believing that it has no legal basis and that the number of committee members is too large, and a few cannot represent the majority of committee members. Wu Wangji believed that the two Yuan can hold a joint symposium once a month to exchange opinions on the current situation and mutually support the cases being conducted by both sides. They can also establish contact in terms of continuing education and entertainment. Supervisory Yuan member Cao Dexuan advocated that the two Yuan should each appoint responsible persons to organize review meetings on various issues and exchange opinions. Supervisory Yuan member Tang Honglie supported a symposium once a month and advocated that the Legislative Yuan should appoint six people and the Supervisory Yuan should appoint five people to be responsible for preparation. Tang also believed that the Supervisory Yuan's work of "fighting tigers and swatting flies" is hindered by the "iron wire net" of the Supervisory Law, and he hoped that the Legislative Yuan would assist in removing it. Finally, Legislative Yuan member Kong Geng made a written suggestion that a symposium be held once a month, and the chairman obtained the consent of the meeting to have six Legislative Yuan members and five Supervisory Yuan members responsible for preparation. It was already near noon, and Li Mengbiao made a concluding remark, saying that hearing everyone's insightful remarks, he deeply felt that today's meeting was of great significance, and his own頹唐 (depressed state) was immediately revived, and he dared not consider himself old anymore. What everyone said represents the people, proving that the country has hope, which he felt very fortunate about. The Legislative and Supervisory Yuan are the left and right arms, and there must be close cooperation. In the future, the two Yuan should earnestly connect, advance their work, and exert their strength. He sincerely wished the Republic of China a thousand autumns and ten thousand years, and good health to his colleagues in both Yuan. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 p.m.

### Chongqing Battleship Set on Fire by Bombing in Huludao Port

On March 18th and 19th, the Air Force continuously flew to Huludao to bomb the Chongqing battleship (arrow indicates the spot), and the picture shows the ship burning after catching fire.

### Thick Smoke Billows from Chongqing Battleship; Most of Huludao Pier Obscured; Supervisory Yuan Members Arrive in Shanghai to Investigate Reasons for Defection

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 20th] After the Chongqing cruiser was hit by three bombs from B24s on the 19th, the oil depot at the stern of the ship caught fire and burned. When a B38 aircraft went to take pictures over Huludao at 5:00 p.m. on the 19th, the billowing smoke from the fire drifted with the wind, obscuring most of the Huludao pier (see picture above).

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] When the Air Force bombed the defecting Chongqing battleship on the 18th and 19th, the ship's anti-aircraft machine guns, eight of 40mm caliber and eight of 20mm caliber, and eight anti-aircraft guns, along with five Communist anti-aircraft guns on the Huludao pier, assisted the defecting battleship in its stubborn resistance. The wind speed was very high that day, and the B24 aircraft chased the defecting battleship in batches over the sky, while resisting the difficulty in aiming caused by the wind speed, and also defending against the harm of 8,000-foot high-altitude artillery shells exploding. Finally, they accomplished the mission of destroying the ship.

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 20th] The Chongqing cruiser has a fuel capacity of 1,100 tons, and its fuel consumption during navigation is 5 tons per hour. Fully loaded with heavy oil, it can cruise for 4,000 nautical miles, sailing at sea for nine days and seven hours. During the First European War, the German cruiser Wolf attacked British and American transport ships in the Atlantic Ocean, wreaking havoc for several years and damaging countless American aid supplies. If the defecting Chongqing battleship had no concerns about the Air Force, its mission in the Communist ports would inevitably follow the old path of the German ship Wolf, obstructing American aid and the connection between the Shanghai and Taiwan sea routes.

[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] Two members of the Supervisory Yuan went to Shanghai last night to investigate the documents related to the defection case of the "Chongqing" battleship. The results of the investigation may be used as a basis for impeaching Navy Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing.

### Lessons from the Defection and Bombing of the Chongqing Battleship; Military Affairs Should Undergo Painful Reform; Overthrow Bloodsuckers and Improve the Treatment of Officers and Soldiers

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] After the Chongqing battleship was bombed and sunk, several military personnel expressed their opinions on various aspects of military affairs that need reform. After the defecting Chongqing battleship was hit by the Air Force, although the ship's hull was damaged due to the burning of the oil depot and the explosion of the ammunition depot, the factors that led to the defection still linger in the military, awaiting reform. For twenty years, the National Army, while building the army, has also had some corrupt military phenomena, brought into the army by bloodsuckers. The most obvious of these is that some military leaders seize military power to amass wealth, and then use that wealth to indulge their bodies and muddle their minds, leading to lax military and political affairs and unclear rewards and punishments. In addition, after fighting with the Communist army, the strategies and tactics are all outdated. There is neither a strong military body nor effective application. Combined with the extravagance of the upper levels and the inability of the middle and lower levels to obtain adequate food and clothing, they naturally become a direct line of decline and failure in the Communist army's offensive, without the ability to resist and support. Although there has been some reform in this situation, it is said that there are still some bad phenomena. First, the national treasury currently issues salaries based on the number of people in the establishment, but the actual number of National Army personnel receiving salaries is less than half of this number. The defeat and capture of military leaders such as Zheng Dongguo, Liao Yaoxiang, and Wang Yaowu seem insufficient to serve as a lesson for some military leaders of similar status who are on the front line today. Although some of them can be hardworking, self-motivated, loyal, and responsible, some, driven by the current economic system and the demands of their unscrupulous spouses, still live deep in the cities in the rear, pursuing wealth and neglecting their duties day and night without shame. Every senior American military official, such as Marshall, Wedemeyer, and Barr, has repeatedly and frankly criticized this phenomenon in the Chinese military, but the military has not reformed itself to this day and must wait for the military offensive of the Communist army to overthrow the entire army. Now, because only half of Jiangnan remains, it seems that the final opportunity has arrived for the military to reform and reorganize itself. If this opportunity passes without reform to protect itself and the country, then the Communist army will break through the Jiang defense and cross the river southward, creating the phenomenon of the Communist army being invincible, which is actually caused by the self-corruption of the National Army. According to these military personnel, the way to reform is very simple: the military should conduct a self-examination and decide to implement measures to improve the military body and effective use as goals. These military personnel also said: The Chongqing incident shows that the composition of modern troops and equipment has extremely high economic value. If the treatment and supply of the personnel using this equipment cannot maintain their physical and mental well-being, and if they are placed in a hopeless situation at the end of the century, then problems will arise in the maintenance and use of this extremely valuable equipment. The defection and destruction of the Chongqing cost more than 10 million pounds. If the "treatment issue" was among the factors for the ship's defection, then the 10 million pounds of the ship's value lost this time is enough to supply the entire Chinese Navy with a year of generous living. The navy cannot sell ships to improve their lives, but they should also respect the Western military principle that excellent equipment must be matched with excellent personnel, otherwise, after receiving Western aid, it is difficult to guarantee that similar Eastern incidents will not occur.

### Long Yun Denies Rumors

Letter to Yunnan Authorities to Investigate and Punish Strictly

[Our Kunming Dispatch, 20th] At a time when the Yunnan situation is unstable, there are many rumors about Long Yun, the former chairman of Yunnan Province, and occasionally disgruntled politicians and idle military officers take his name to harm the local people. After Long learned of this in Hong Kong, he expressed extreme anger. In addition to solemnly denying the rumors, he also wrote to the Yunnan authorities to investigate and punish them strictly in order to maintain the safety of his hometown.

### Joint Defense Completed in the 5th and 6th Pacification Zones of Henan and Hubei; Local Communists Attacked Yingcheng Unsuccessfully; Communist Army North of the Yangtze Still in the Deployment Phase

[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 20th] Military News: The joint defense work between the 5th Pacification Zone of southern Henan and the 6th Pacification Zone of northeastern Hubei has been completed as planned. The 6th Pacification Zone currently governs 20 counties in northern and eastern Hubei, including Xiaogan, Yingcheng, Lishan, and Macheng. It is a pilot zone with effective implementation of the Central China land policy. The commander is Lieutenant General Zhang Guangwei, the former deputy commander of Zhang Gan's army group.

[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 20th] Military sources confirm that more than 7,000 troops under Zhang Tixue of the Communist Jianghan Military Region launched continuous attacks on Yingcheng (90 kilometers from Hankou) in northern Hubei on the 17th and 18th, once approaching the northeastern suburbs of the city to a distance of nine li. They were repelled by reinforcements from a certain unit of Zhang Gan's army group stationed in the city. Today, traffic between Xiaogan and Changjiangbu and Yingcheng is still operating normally.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 20th] Local Communists in central and western Hubei have been showing signs of opportunistic movement in recent days. The National Army is holding a calm stance, and there have been no major engagements so far. In addition, in order to strengthen the defense of the Yangtze River, the authorities have dispatched naval reinforcements to all ports from Yichang downstream to Wuxue upstream.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] In recent days, various bridgeheads of the National Army north of the Yangtze River, such as Yiwei, Kouan, Shijiaqiao, Bazigang, and Yuxikou, have been frequently attacked and harassed by the Communist army, but their nature still remains at the stage of reconnaissance, probing, and disturbance, and has not yet officially launched a full-scale offensive. According to a senior military official speaking to reporters: The troops of Chen Yi, gathered north of the Yangtze River, have increased to eighteen armies. Their main force is stationed along the Huainan Railway and the canal area, while the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is relatively weak. The constant harassment and attacks by the Communist army are obviously intended to cover and facilitate the complete and thorough deployment of their large army. However, according to the official's estimate, large-scale actions against the bridgeheads are unlikely in the near future. However, this does not mean that the Communist army does not intend to capture the bridgeheads as a prelude to crossing the Yangtze River. As for crossing the Yangtze River, it is still too early to say, for the reason that, on the one hand, preparations for crossing the river have not yet been completed, and on the other hand, large-scale crossing cannot be carried out before the bridgehead positions are occupied. Furthermore, it is judged here that the five armies of Lin Biao's troops that went south to Xuzhou have mostly been transferred to southern Henan, and the hearts of the people in Jiangnan, which were once tense, have temporarily calmed down again.

### Situation Stabilized in Guanzhong; National Army Recaptures Dali

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Military News: After the National Army in Guanzhong recovered the line from Gouyi in the west through Tongchuan to Beicheng in the east, the situation has stabilized.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 19th] The Xi'an Pacification Headquarters issued a war report at 6:00 p.m. on the 19th: The National Army's advancing troops captured Dali County City at 4:00 p.m. today.

### Zhang Fakui and Yu Hanmou Arrive in Nanjing from Guangzhou in Response to Summons; Immediately Visit Acting President Li and Premier He After Disembarking; Yu Denies Rumors of Rebellion on the Fujian-Guangdong Border

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Army Commander-in-Chief Zhang Fakui and Guangzhou Pacification Director Yu Hanmou arrived in Nanjing by plane from Guangzhou at 3:00 p.m. on the 20th in response to Acting President Li's telegram summons. Representatives sent by Acting President Li and Premier He Yingqin welcomed them. After disembarking, Zhang and Yu paid their respects to Acting President Li at 3:30 p.m. and then visited Premier He at 4:00 p.m., having a long talk for about an hour. At around 5:30 p.m., they returned to their residence at the Capital Hotel, where they met with Xu Yongchang, Gu Zhutong, Jiang Dingwen, Guo Chan, Zhang Zhen, Liu Shiyi, and Chen Cheng and Zhu Shaoliang, who were already staying at the Capital Hotel. For a time, senior generals gathered, and the conversation dispersed at around 7:00 p.m. In the evening, Gu Zhutong hosted a banquet at his private residence to welcome Zhang and Yu. Chen Cheng, Zhu Shaoliang, Xu Yongchang, Jiang Dingwen, Gui Yongqing, Guo Chan, Lin Wei, and others were invited to attend. Yu told reporters at his residence on the 20th that he came in response to Acting President Li's summons to report on the situation in Guangdong and planned to stay for two or three days before returning to Guangzhou. Yu also denied the rumors that a rebellion had occurred on the Fujian-Guangdong border, saying that Shantou was stable and that Mo Xide, the commander of the Fifth Suppression Zone in Guangdong, had not been detained.

### Editorial: Understanding and Grasping True Peace

—Five Hopes for President He—

President He claims that the primary tasks of his cabinet are to reform politics and seek peace. Therefore, after the cabinet is formed, it should be a "peace cabinet." However, on the eve of the formation of his peace cabinet, a series of atmospheres contrary to peace have been transmitted one after another. Not only does the Communist army's crossing-the-Yangtze River battle in China seem to be imminent, but the whole world, with the announcement of the North Atlantic Treaty, also seems to smell gunpowder. Under such war pressure, how can the He cabinet achieve the task of seeking peace? This is indeed an extremely difficult task.

We believe that to seek peace today, we must first distinguish between true and false peace. Then, we must do our best to pursue true peace so that we do not fall into the trap of false peace, which would make the entire country and nation unable to extricate themselves.

The distinction between true and false peace has long been a topic of heated discussion within the Communist area, under the instruction of Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party. Moreover, I am afraid that the Communist Party members and their affiliated groups within the government-controlled area are also responding to the discussion. In their view, of course, the peace advocated and strived for by President Chiang, Acting President Li, President He, and even Zhang Zhizhong and Shao Lizi is all "false peace directed by American imperialism." Only those who follow "Chairman Mao's Eight Articles" respectfully are pursuing true peace. However, to this day, we have not seen or heard that Kuomintang members or ordinary, non-partisan people pay attention to the distinction between true and false peace. For example, the Communist Party believes that only peace in the "Beiping model" can barely be considered true peace. It seems that I saw in a newspaper report that Shao Lizi once said in Beiping that people in the South are willing to have peace in the "Beiping model." Besides that, it seems that no other responses have been heard. We do not know if Shao really said this. If it is true, we do not know what Shao based his statement on. We would like to stand on the side of the people and raise this issue for discussion.

From the 13th to yesterday, this newspaper has continuously published Jiang Xuejun's report on the "Beiping Model." This should give readers a rough outline of the "Beiping Model." In a nutshell, the large slogans written on the walls of Beiping that "Fu Zuoyi surrendered with his troops" are a true depiction of the "Beiping Model!" In fact, Fu Zuoyi not only "surrendered with his troops," but he simply led the people of Beiping to "surrender!" What qualifications do the surrendered soldiers and civilians have to talk about equality and freedom? Therefore, it is not entirely "color blindness" that foreign news agencies only now say that the Chinese Communists have torn up all thirteen articles of the Beiping Armistice Agreement, which is also the Peace Agreement. We have long pointed out that what the people want is peace, not surrender; what the government should seek for the people is also peace, not surrender. The Chinese Communists have honestly stated that the "Beiping Model" of peace is "surrender." Does Shao Lizi want to stand in the position of the government representative and forcibly represent the people, saying that the people in the South are all willing to surrender unconditionally to the Chinese Communists? We would like to warn the He cabinet: it is acceptable to form a "peace cabinet," but it is not acceptable to be a "surrender cabinet!"

True peace is peace; false peace is surrender! Then, what is the difference between peace and surrender?

To recognize the true face of peace, we must at least have the following five points:

(1) National Independence. We want peace to build the country. The Republic of China is owned by all 400 million compatriots. We cannot allow our country to become a dependency of a power state for the sake of peace. If we are willing to bow our heads and become vassals within the iron curtain in a peaceful fantasy, then we can applaud the betrayal of the country by people like Wang Jingwei, who went to negotiate peace with the invading Japanese warlords, and there is no need to resist until the end. Therefore, if there is any place in the conditions for peace negotiations that harms the country's independent sovereignty, then it is not true peace.

(2) Territorial Integrity. Whether the territory of the Republic of China is complete; to change the territory of the country, legal procedures must be followed, otherwise it is unconstitutional and treasonous. As for dividing the country's territory and making it incomplete, it is also not allowed by the people. The country's political system can be changed according to the times, but the integrity of the country's territory must never be sacrificed under the smoke screen of peace.

(3) Political Democracy. What we want is direct democracy, that is, the implementation of full people's politics. We only regret that the Three Principles of the People have not been truly implemented before, but we do not want to change to another ideology. Moreover, the Chinese Communists also claim that the Three Principles of the People are necessary for China today and are willing to fight for them. Mao Zedong's followers are also saying that his "New Democracy" is the implementation of the Three Principles of the People. Then, we have the right to demand that all regions of the country seriously compete in political democracy. If secret agent politics are not only not changed but even strengthened, and the people's basic rights are not only not guaranteed but even further deprived, then it is further away from democracy and definitely not the result of peace that the people hope for.

(4) Economic Equality. Only with equality can there be harmony. Therefore, if peace cannot be built on the foundation of economic equality, the ivory tower of peace will also be shaky. The biggest shortcoming of the government's administration today is that it has not implemented the Principle of People's Livelihood, so that social wealth cannot achieve a considerable balance. Chinese society does not need communism, and it is not necessary to forcibly abolish the private property system, but it certainly cannot tolerate any form of unscrupulous exploitation by the powerful and wealthy, making the poor poorer and the rich richer, and plunging the entire society into a state of inequality and unrest. We advocate that the state use social policies to make the redistribution of social wealth reasonable, but we do not approve of using violence to conduct endless "liquidation" and "struggle," so that everyone perishes together under the blind slogan of "turning over," and everyone becomes "greatly impoverished." We hope that under the conditions of peace, the people will be guaranteed to live and work in peace and contentment under the principle of economic equality, and work hard in production and marketing.

(5) Freedom of Thought. The value of life lies not only in the enjoyment of material life but also in the free spiritual life. Because people have humanity, and humanity is endowed by heaven and is completely free. The Western philosopher said, "Man is born free," and the constitution refers to this. If a person does not have freedom of thought, then they lose the joy of life. "Give me liberty, or give me death" refers to freedom of thought, and freedom of speech, freedom of publication, freedom of the press, etc. all belong to it. What we the people firmly strive for is that the lifestyle of freedom of thought must be maintained. If the government, under the guise of peace, sells the basic human rights of freedom of thought of our people just to seek temporary peace, it is tantamount to buying a casket and returning the pearl, and what we will inevitably obtain is a false peace.

As is well known, the Chinese people have no extravagant hopes today, but seek national independence, territorial integrity, political democracy, economic equality, and freedom of thought. If these five points can be guaranteed, we are willing to see the country gain vitality in peace. The government should respond to the people's hopes, seize this opportunity, and openly and honestly ask the Chinese Communists to send representatives to start peace talks as soon as possible. The leaders of the Chinese Communists should also deeply appreciate the meaning of the people, abandon the illusion of believing in unification by force, and resolutely send representatives to discuss the conditions for peace based on these five principles. As for us, the people, we should not underestimate ourselves and only stand by and watch, letting the situation evolve naturally. We should seize this opportunity when the Communist army is preparing to cross the river and the flames of war have not yet been rekindled, unite our efforts and call out in unison, not allowing any party to fire a gun, not allowing any party to cross the river to fight, and waiting for peace negotiations. At present, the Yangtze River seems to be a natural boundary line of peace; whoever crosses this boundary line to attack is a war peddler who chants false peace!

### Eighth Session of the Hankou City Council Opens; Bai Chongxi Elaborates on Peace; It is Said That Peace Requires Paying a Price to Be Fair and Reasonable

[Special Dispatch from Hankou, This Newspaper, 20th] The eighth session of the Hankou City Council opened on the morning of the 20th. Speaker Zhang Chuanchuan gave an opening speech, emphasizing "seeking unity internally and seeking peace externally" and listing stabilizing the economy and improving people's livelihood as the main topics of the meeting. Subsequently, General Commander Bai, Chairman Zhu, Mayor Yan, and others delivered speeches, frankly providing opinions on the current urgent matters.

[Special Dispatch from Hankou, This Newspaper, 20th] General Commander Bai attended the opening ceremony of the City Council in the spring rain on the 20th and delivered a speech. The council members listened with great interest. Bai reported that the sincerity in seeking peace is unanimously shared by the entire country, but peace does not come with a simple shout. A considerable price must be paid to strive for fair and reasonable peace. Some people now advocate stopping conscription and grain requisition to show sincerity for peace, which is not quite correct. Bai cited the historical facts that the three dynasties prospered because soldiers and farmers were one, and the Song dynasty perished because the conscription system was abolished. He repeatedly stated: "The conscription system is the best system to enrich national defense. Even if peace is achieved, there is no reason to abolish it. So-called being vigilant in times of peace and being prepared for danger. Now that there is no peace, conscription should not be stopped, let alone the Communist army is marching south step by step, and their military service movement is more strict and active than ours. How can we cut off our hands to seek peace?" At this point, Bai discussed the issue of reform in detail, believing that reform must first reform the heart. Everything cannot just be empty talk. We must recognize the world trend of solving people's livelihood and earnestly do things for the people. He said: After the He cabinet is formed, the future of reform and peace will become brighter.

### Mo Xide Arrives in Guangzhou to Talk; Rumors of Rebellion in Chaoshan Are Groundless; Yu Yingqi Sits in Chao'an to Suppress Bandits; External Transportation in Shantou Has Not Been Interrupted

[Special Dispatch from Guangzhou, This Newspaper, 20th] Recently, rumors have spread that Yu Yingqi, Commander of Bandit Suppression in the Fujian-Guangdong Border Area, has rebelled, and that Zeng Juzhi and Mo Xide, Commanders of Bandit Suppression in the Fourth and Fifth Districts, have been detained by Yu. The Sui Jing'an Office spokesperson here has solemnly denied this, saying that this is obviously a rumor fabricated by traitors to try to sow discord. Zeng Juzhi, Commander of the Fourth District, who was rumored to have been detained, is currently recuperating in Guangzhou due to injuries sustained in the campaign. Mo Xide, Commander of the Fifth District, has arrived in Guangzhou from Shantou to report on his work. According to Mo, this news is completely unfounded. Commander Yu is still sitting in Chao'an to suppress bandits, and external transportation in Shantou has not been interrupted. How can there be rumors of rebellion? As for the navy opening Shantou, it is purely to welcome the British fleet and has no other mission. The bandit situation in Dongjiang is also not as serious as rumored.

### The Soviet Union Accelerates Infiltration into Xinjiang; The Washington Star Publishes an Article Commenting on It

[US News Agency, Washington, 19th] The Washington Star published an article by Stoddard commenting on the Red Army's infiltration into Xinjiang and the intensification of control over China. Stoddard said: After the Communist Party's victory in China, regardless of what interests the Chinese Communist regime ultimately has for Moscow, Moscow will inevitably organize infiltration into the vast territories west of mainland China. Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet have limited natural resources, and their value to the Soviet Union is mostly strategic. Once they are obtained, they can control the entire heart of Asia and exert pressure on both China and India. The first stage of Soviet expansion occurred 25 years ago when the Communist Party turned Outer Mongolia into a "People's Republic" that obeyed Moscow. Now it is expanding to Inner Mongolia. At the same time, the Soviet Union is now accelerating its infiltration into Xinjiang. Although Xinjiang is remote, it can be infiltrated from China in the east and from other parts of Turkestan in the west. Xinjiang was an important link in the past for traveling caravans. China's effective control over Xinjiang began two centuries ago, but it has never "Sinicized" Xinjiang. Whether Muslims or non-Muslims, resettlement in Xinjiang has not been successful. Today, the Han Chinese in Xinjiang are almost only garrison troops, officials, and diners.

The rebellion that occurred five years ago has never been quelled, and the importance now lies in this kind of support, how much of which is officially backed by the Soviet Union. Western Turkestan has undergone drastic changes since the Bolshevik Revolution. This is indeed conducive to the Soviet Union's plans for Eastern Turkestan. At the same time, the Turks in Xinjiang have been discriminated against for years under the rule of the Tsars and Chinese masters. Today, Soviet propaganda still encounters strong opposition, because most of the Turks in Xinjiang are devout Muslims. Their conservative economic and social ideas are inherently resistant to communism. However, unfortunately, the incompetence of Chinese rule has angered the residents, causing them to lean towards the Soviet Union. The recent rebellion was obviously supported by the Soviet Union behind the scenes, and Moscow has once again gained a foothold at the door of Xinjiang.

In fact, there are various signs that the Chinese authorities are willing to reach an agreement with Moscow. Judging from the current situation, it is difficult to prevent the Soviet Union from taking whatever it wants, and Xinjiang will become a Soviet protectorate. The current rebel regime has formed its Turkestan "Republic." If Xinjiang is controlled by the Soviet Union, the consequences would be serious. First, China is already surrounded in the north by Soviet Mongolia, and now it will be surrounded by another Soviet satellite state, which will inevitably increase Soviet pressure on China. Secondly, after Xinjiang is controlled, Moscow will have a direct route from Kashmir to India. This remote mountainous plateau, the "roof of Asia," hangs over India and further surrounds China. Soviet infiltration into Xinjiang is difficult, but not impossible. Once the Soviet Union infiltrates Tibet, its control over the heart of Asia can be said to be complete.

### Masked Robbers in Hangzhou Apprehended

[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, This Newspaper, 20th] Masked robbers have been repeatedly discovered in Hangzhou robbing property recently. The criminal police team solved the case on the evening of the 19th and arrested the masked robbers Xie Guozhen, Ge Xiangsheng, Xu Mengzhi, Lin Huaichun, and family member Chen Qiuxin, a total of five people, as well as three pistols and three bullets.

### Serious Inflation in the Communist Area; Causing Complicated Problems Such as Exchange Rates, Prices, and Wages; Tianjin Branch of the "People's Bank" Offers Deposit in Kind

[United Press, This City] The impact of inflation on the Chinese Communist Party can be proven by various signs. In the weeks after the fall of Beiping, favorable exchange rates could be obtained for remittances to Beiping. Namely, the gold yuan could be exchanged at par, and people's banknotes could be exchanged at a higher purchasing rate. However, remittances to Beiping were suddenly suspended last week, and the reason is not very clear, but it is rumored that the exchange rate has dropped sharply. A few days later, it was announced here that remittances could be handled by five designated banks, but these banks did not show enthusiastic interest in handling them. The reason is also not very clear. It is said that there is a lack of communication between the north and south branches, or that the financial authorities here are still indifferent to opening remittance business to cities in North China. Some bankers believe that the exchange rate between Beiping and Tianjin is so unfavorable that both the remitter and the recipient suffer losses. The authorities in North China may even try to implement an official exchange rate, which means freezing the currency value. When the gold yuan was issued last year, the Nationalist government tried to freeze it and failed. The Chinese Communist Party has undeniably experienced inflation, but until recently, it has been proven that the inflation of the people's banknotes has not been as severe as that of the gold yuan. However, until recently, the Chinese Communist Party did not cope with urban economies. The Chinese Communist Party's rural economy is not overly reliant on currency. The Chinese Communist Party has not engaged in the management and support of large cities in the past. Now it must take on this responsibility, thus falling into the same inflationary trap as the Nationalist government. The Communist currency is also not fully prepared, so it cannot avoid inflation, which leads to the same complicated problems of exchange rates, price controls, and wage indices. It is said that one of the reasons why the Communist Party is concealing the news of Beiping and Tianjin is this.

### Historical Facts of the Chongqing Warship

[Our Dispatch] The Chongqing warship was completed in 1937. It was a battlecruiser weighing 7,000 tons, with a length of 505 feet and a width of 51 feet. It had six 6-inch armored main guns, mounted in three turrets and electrically controlled. It also possessed eight 4-inch secondary guns, capable of both anti-aircraft and surface fire, mounted in four turrets; eight anti-aircraft machine guns; one 6-inch gun command station; and two 4-inch gun command stations, all equipped with command instruments to enable concentrated fire. There were also six 21-inch torpedo launchers, mounted on the port and starboard sides. Depth charges were launched from the stern. It had two sets of anti-submarine paravanes and a magnetic mine defense grid, as well as four sets of radar, one for air surveillance, one for surface surveillance, and the remaining two for air and surface combat. Its horsepower was 64,000, with a maximum speed of 30 nautical miles per hour and a range of 4,000 nautical miles.

The ship was originally named the Aurora. During World War II, it first served as a North Sea escort, then participated in the sinking of the German battleship Bismarck, and later was transferred to the Mediterranean to participate in the North African landings, specifically targeting the Italian fleet. It sank as many as 16 Italian transport ships. The most glorious and world-renowned battle feat of the ship was its encounter with an Italian cruiser armed with eight 8-inch guns. Despite being weaker in firepower, it fought bravely and ultimately forced the Italian ship to retreat, damaged. Due to this glorious achievement, the ship was given the endearing nickname "Silver Ghost" at the time. In June 1943, during a very tense period of the European war, the British King sailed on the ship to Malta to inspect the defending troops.

After the end of the war, Britain gifted the ship to China and assisted us in training our navy. At the end of 1946, more than 600 Chinese naval officers and students went to Portsmouth and served as junior officers and ordinary soldiers in the British Navy, receiving training for more than a year. On May 19, 1948, the ship and the "Lingfu" warship were formally handed over to our side. A solemn and simple ship presentation ceremony was held at noon that day in Portsmouth Harbour, presided over by Admiral Fraser, Commander-in-Chief of Portsmouth Harbour. Ambassador Zheng Tianxi, our ambassador to the UK, represented China in receiving the ship.

On May 26, the ship, commanded by Captain Deng Zhaoxiang, sailed back to China with the fully trained officers and men, arriving in Nanjing in mid-August. In early September, after arriving in Shanghai to replenish supplies, just as the war in the Northeast was tense, the ship escorted President Chiang to Yingkou and Huludao to direct operations. When the Northeast fell, it covered the retreat of the 52nd Army in Huludao, and also sank many Communist ships sailing from Dalian to Yantai in the Bohai Sea.

The Chongqing warship's disadvantage was its enormous consumption. During combat, it consumed about 100 tons of oil per day, and even when docked, it required more than 10 tons of diesel per day. It is said that the daily expenses of the ship were no less than the value of a regular army brigade.

Legislators Wang Zemin, Yu Zheng, Yang Buping, Yang Baodong, Dong Zheng, Qi Zhihou, and others spoke in succession, stating that although conscription and grain collection were necessary, malpractices were rampant and must be improved, otherwise the disadvantages would outweigh the advantages, causing hardship to the people.

### In Response to the North Atlantic Treaty, the Soviet Union Will Take Countermeasures. East Germany Holds Military Exercises Early

[Agence France-Presse London, 20th] According to authoritative sources in the "Sunday Express" this morning, it is believed that the Soviet Union's response to the government's Atlantic Pact will be to take large-scale measures soon.

If the United Nations and the United States can eliminate these misinterpretations, they will make great contributions to world peace.

[Our Dispatch] The resumption of business by gold shops that are members of the Shanghai Gold Business Association has finally occurred, as the Ministry of Finance's order is like a mountain. The Ministry hopes that the association will resume business starting on the 21st (today). Therefore, the association decided to convene the 56 registered sound member companies today to resume business first. At the same time, it was decided that formal market trading will begin at 10:00 AM on the 22nd inside the association. The association specially made a formal announcement in various newspapers today, notifying all registered members to take note and handle accordingly. Today's resumption of business is actually only a formality and there is no ceremony. However, the association is scheduled to convene the 56 registered sound member companies at 3:00 PM today to discuss the various technical issues of gold trading and delivery after the resumption of business, such as trading procedures, transfer and reconciliation methods, etc. At the same time, the order of the numbers of each resuming member will be determined by drawing lots. The spot gold trading method approved by the Ministry of Finance on the 16th of this month will also be presented at the meeting for interpretation, so that the members of the association can know what to follow. After the association resumes business, in addition to the 56 member companies that have resumed business, all original old members of the association can continue to apply for resumption of business without any time limit.

The full text of the more than ten articles of the method of trading spot gold and the number plate names of the resuming members of the association will be announced after the association files with the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs this morning. However, according to reporters' inquiries, after the association resumes market trading, the trading objects will still be limited to gold, and will not include silver and silver dollars. The market hours are from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM every day, except on holidays, and from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The unit and fineness of the transaction will be based on the ten-tael factory bar issued by the Central Bank. After the resumption of market trading, each member company can send two representatives to the market to negotiate transactions. The market will be temporarily located in the hall of the association's address at No. 4, Lane 43, North Wuxi Road. When reporters visited the association yesterday, they saw that the accumulated goods in the hall had been cleared, and the craftsmen were rushing to build the various market facilities overnight. One hundred pairs of intercom telephones are also expected to be installed tomorrow.

The association has now sent notes to various competent authorities, including the Ministry of Finance, the Financial Management Bureau, the Central Bank, and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, inviting them to send personnel to attend and guide when the association officially resumes market trading at 10:00 AM on the 22nd.

### 800,000 Silver Coins Delivered to the National Bank for the Market. The Mint Produces 110,000 to 120,000 Coins Per Day

[Our Dispatch] The silver coin printing machines of the Central Mint have been installed with four units, and the remaining one can be completed within a few days. Once all five machines are installed, they can start working day and night. Currently, only single-day work is still being done, and each printing machine produces 30,000 silver dollars per day, about 110,000 to 120,000 per day. Because the Central Bank urgently needs to put new silver dollars on the market, they are delivered as they are produced. As of yesterday, a total of 800,000 coins have been delivered to the National Bank. After the five printing machines start working day and night, they can produce 300,000 silver dollars per day and night.

### Cash Panic Can Be Resolved. The National Bank Will Supply as Much as Possible Starting Today

[Our Dispatch] Regarding the cash panic in this city, according to a spokesperson for the Central Bank who spoke to reporters yesterday, it will be gradually improved starting today. The National Bank will supply an adequate amount of 500-yuan notes as much as possible starting today, so as to meet the needs of all sectors. As for rumors that 1,000-yuan notes will be released in large quantities, the spokesperson was unwilling to make a definite statement, only saying that in principle, 1,000-yuan notes are still mainly supplied to other cities, because their volume and weight are smaller, making them easier for large-amount transportation. As for this city, if an adequate amount of 500-yuan notes are issued, it will be enough to meet the needs. In addition, the large-scale payment of salaries by state-owned and private enterprises has mostly been completed before the 20th, so the need for a large amount of cash has decreased. If the cash can maintain a regular supply, the cash panic will be completely eliminated within a week.

### Serial Piracy on Sea Vessels; Two Robbers Each Sentenced to Imprisonment

[Our Report] In a case of banditry transferred by the Special Criminal Court to the District Court, Judge Xie Zhiying of the court pronounced the sentence the day before yesterday: Defendants Gu Jinshan and Shi Caiqi, jointly committing serial piracy on the ocean, each sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights. The two defendants were boatmen by trade. On June 5th of last year, together with Lu Quan (who was killed) and Cai Hongxiang, who is still at large, they sailed to the vicinity of Xiaohe off the Wusong estuary to commit robbery. At approximately 3:00 PM that afternoon, a Ningbo fishing boat appeared on the sea surface. Lu Quan immediately used a short gun to order the fishing boat to stop, and led the group onto the boat, robbing three rifles and one pistol. The next evening, while the Gu group was anchored at Bei Xiaohe, they saw a painted boat approaching, intending to harbor for the night. When the ship approached the bandit boat, Lu again led the group on board and forcibly robbed the painted boat. Gu and Shi then transported the stolen goods to Wusong for sale. They were apprehended by the Gaoqiao Police Precinct, which recovered the stolen goods and transferred them to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. The case was then transferred to the Special Criminal Court. With the closure of that court, the case was returned to the District Court for the above judgment.

A Thousand Gold Misses Round Out a Fine Gentleman - Chen Huiling

### More Than Forty Officers and Soldiers of the Chongqing Warship Left Behind in Shanghai, Arranged for Separate Accommodation; Deputy Captain Mou's Opinion on the Significance of Deliberate Destruction Is the Rectification of Military Discipline

[Our Report] When the cruiser Chongqing sailed to the Bohai Sea without orders, there were a total of 587 officers and soldiers on board. There were 44 officers and soldiers, including Deputy Captain Mou Bingjian, who were ashore on official business. When they returned to the ship after completing their duties, they discovered that the Chongqing had quietly sailed north. Currently, these more than forty officers and soldiers have been separately accommodated by Deputy Captain Mou. Mou himself will also report to the Naval Headquarters for duty on the first of next month.

According to Mou: When the Chongqing was transferred from the Jiangnan Shipyard to anchor at the Wusong estuary, the situation at the time was turbulent, so it maintained mobility, and the fuel supply was sufficient to cope with all contingencies. The reason for its departure is a mystery. Warships are different from airplanes; even if a few people had dissenting opinions, they could not force the ship to sail north. The only explanation is that the captain received forged orders and sailed north on his own initiative. The captain's authority at sea is supreme; once an order is issued, no one dares to object. However, given Captain Deng's personality, he is an extremely law-abiding person, and it seems unlikely that he would take such a drastic action. The truth will not be known until officers and soldiers from the ship return. From a military point of view, none of the seaports in North and Northeast China, except for Lushun and Dalian, can provide a place for this giant ship to dock and repair. Although Dagu has facilities, it can only be used for small ships and cannot repair the Chongqing. Regular repair work is indispensable for any type of ship. If it cannot dock in Lushun and Dalian, the Chongqing, even if it does not return south, will become unusable after six months in the Bohai Sea due to the lack of maintenance facilities. At the same time, the CCP has no military value in acquiring this giant ship, because the ship's personnel are insufficient, and there are not enough to allocate for duty. Among the 44 officers and soldiers remaining in Shanghai, 14 are skilled in managing the engines. Therefore, from a technical point of view, even though this ship is in the hands of the CCP, it will not immediately pose a significant threat here. The authorities' current decision to destroy it by the air force probably contains the meaning of rectifying military discipline. Deputy Captain Mou went to Nanjing on official business on the 22nd of last month, and the Chongqing had already sailed away by the time he returned to Shanghai. Mou is very fortunate that he was not involved in this incident, but his important belongings were lost with the northward voyage of this giant ship. Due to the unrest at the time, naval personnel placed their important belongings on the ship to prevent accidents. Unexpectedly, Shanghai was peaceful, but the warship itself was the first to have problems.

Cadet Captain Lu Dongge's Elderly Mother, Wife, and Children Are All in Shanghai

In addition, Colonel Lu Dongge, the Chief of the Naval Headquarters, who was stationed on the Chongqing as a cadet, also sailed north with the ship and has not been heard from since. His wife, Song Lixia, is currently caring for his seventy-year-old mother and raising his ten-month-old son, residing in the naval officers' dormitory here. There are also two nephews of Colonel Lu who fled from North China and are also being supported by her, living a very difficult life. Mrs. Song told reporters yesterday that her husband was serving as a cadet captain on the Chongqing, equivalent to a guest, and had no real command authority. The rumors that he was responsible for command and combat were a misunderstanding. The dependents of the Chongqing's officers and soldiers are now scattered in various places, and there are also some in this city. Currently, the Naval Headquarters is still issuing the salaries and rice rations to each person to maintain the livelihood of their families.

### Sanmao Paradise Association to Raise Funds on April 4th

[Our Report] "Sanmao" is a character created by cartoonist Zhang Leping, depicting a child who becomes a homeless wanderer, living a life of hardship and enduring all kinds of cruel treatment. Even today, there are countless unfortunate children in society who are experiencing the same plight as Sanmao, struggling to live in hunger and wind and rain, enduring cruelty and not enjoying the warmth of human kindness. To this end, the China Welfare Fund, chaired by Madame Sun Yat-sen Soong Ching Ling, is organizing a permanent "Sanmao Paradise Association" and will begin recruiting members on Children's Day, April 4th. The association will also hold a Sanmao book exhibition at the Dazhong Company on the fourth floor starting on that day, as well as exhibiting the association's child welfare work and photos and charts of Yucai School founded by Tao Xingzhi, to raise funds for child welfare.

### Soochow University Law School Holds Exhibition of Legal Codes, Books, and Cultural Relics

### Silver Dollar Vendors Concentrated; Reality Not Yet Seen; Fraudulent Acts Occur Frequently; Management Truly Needs to Be Strengthened

[Our Report] The authorities recently announced the implementation of management measures for silver dollar vendors, and designated seventeen business locations, stipulating centralized operations. However, several days have passed, and this has not yet been formally achieved. In the past week, the number of people engaged in silver dollar trading has increased daily. Those who previously traded as street vendors have also joined the ranks of silver dollar trading. It is estimated that at least 20,000 people now depend on this trade for their livelihood. These people have no fixed organization, and their current distribution is purely based on convenient transportation, areas with a concentration of middle and lower-class families, and places with more ordinary stores, so that they can easily maintain contact with general salary earners or store employees. If they are forced to relocate to centralized business locations, they will strongly oppose it because of fewer trading opportunities, so implementation will be difficult. The police bureau is currently conducting surprise arrests of silver dollar vendors, but the reason is to crack down on their obstruction of traffic or disruption of order. In fact, the silver dollar vendors are a diverse group, and fraudulent acts against customers occur daily, such as selling silver dollars made with copper pieces sandwiched in silver shells, or inserting small denominations into large bills to misrepresent the total amount paid, causing frequent disputes between buyers and sellers. To improve this, the authorities must quickly devise measures to strengthen management. Before the establishment of a gold and silver market, silver dollar vendors are at least a way for general salary earners to mutually exchange goods and maintain the value of currency. If managed properly, the general public and both buyers and sellers can hope to gain some security in their economic lives. In addition to silver dollar vendors, many tobacco and paper shops near the central district have also begun to engage in silver dollar trading, and are posting daily buy and sell prices, a situation that easily reminds people of the situation fifteen years ago when silver coins were exchanged for copper coins.

### Luxurious Train Returns to Simplicity; Air Conditioning Removed, Resumes Operation on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line

[Our Report] The air-conditioned express train that caused a sensation in the national railway industry in late summer last year, operated on the Nanjing-Shanghai line for less than half a year after leaving the factory, before encountering the great chaos caused by the government's relocation to the south and extensive military transport. The Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Bureau greatly valued this streamlined, air-conditioned train and immediately stopped its operation, sending it to the Qishuyan Locomotive Factory for "refuge." Therefore, the express train did not suffer any damage during the "great chaos." The railway bureau believes that such a luxurious and perfect train is not needed during this period. To adapt to the environment, it is now planning to replace the original double-sealed windows of the train with movable windows that can be opened and closed freely, and the air conditioning equipment will also be removed. The color scheme of the carriages, designed by a professor of fine arts from National Central University, will also be completely painted over and repainted in a uniform dark green to match other first-class carriages. The reclining seats in the carriages will remain. In short, efforts will be made to remove the "aristocratic" aura from this aristocratic train. Once the modification is completed, it can resume operation on the Nanjing-Shanghai line.

### Zhabei Police Precinct Chief Sun Keqiang Detained; Accused of Embezzlement, Dereliction of Duty, and Other Verified Crimes

[Our Report] Zhabei Precinct Chief Sun Keqiang has recently been accused of embezzlement, dereliction of duty, and harboring criminals. After Director Mao approved the dispatch of personnel from the Inspectorate to investigate and verify the allegations, he ordered Sun to be detained yesterday afternoon and handed over to the Criminal Division for investigation. Sun originally served as the Gaoqiao Precinct Chief, and was then transferred to the Jiangwan Precinct Chief. After less than half a year, he was transferred to the Zhabei Precinct Chief, where he has remained until now. According to reliable sources, Sun Keqiang is involved in a major case in addition to the charges of embezzlement and dereliction of duty, and the circumstances are serious. After taking over as Director of the Police Bureau, Mao is determined to eradicate corruption and will thoroughly investigate this case and punish it according to law.

### Hengya Bookstore Employee Commits Another Crime Soon After Being Released From Prison; Gu Guozhen Robs a Female Customer With Accomplices; Sentenced to Ten Years and Six Months of Imprisonment; Other Two Accomplices Each Sentenced to Seven Years

[Our Report] Gu Guozhen, also known as Gu Miaogen, an employee of the Hengya Bookstore in this city, was previously sentenced to eight months in prison for fraud. Shortly after being released from prison in July of last year, he became an employee of the Hengya Bookstore. On the evening of the eighth of last month, he saw a female customer, Xu Huifang, wearing a diamond ring that shone brightly, and he had bad intentions. Knowing that his colleague Yao Wenqiao was acquainted with the woman, he invited Yao and other friends, Liang Guocheng and Chen Xiangdang, who is still at large, to follow the woman to her residence at 221 Beihai Road when she left the bookstore. Gu handed a pistol purchased by Wang Guangtuo to Liang Guocheng and they, along with Chen Xiangdang, entered the residence to commit robbery. Gu stayed outside to watch for any signs of trouble, closed the curtains, and used the gun to threaten silence. They robbed the female customer Xu Huifang of a diamond ring she was wearing, as well as two diamond rings sent by Ding Liufulian. They then returned to the Hengya Bookstore and entrusted Gu Guozhen to sell or hide the stolen goods. After receiving the report, the police suspected that Gu's wife, Ni Caizhen, and Gu's friend, Zhang Yunpeng, were also accomplices, and arrested them together. They were transferred to the District Court for trial. The day before yesterday, Judge Xie Zhiying of the District Court pronounced the sentence: Gu Guozhen, Liang Guocheng, and Yao Wenqiao jointly committed robbery. Gu Guozhen, as a repeat offender, was sentenced to ten years and six months of imprisonment and five years of deprivation of civil rights. Liang and Yao were each sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and five years of deprivation of civil rights. Zhang Yunpeng and Ni Caizhen were both found not guilty.

### Five Suspicious Individuals Arrested for Carrying Weapons and Gambling Tools

[Our Report] At approximately 5:00 AM yesterday morning, patrolman Fu Jie of the Dongjiadu Police Station of the Penglai Police Precinct led two policemen on patrol to the intersection of Lujiabang Road and Nancang Street. In the darkness, they discovered five men gathered there. The policemen shone a flashlight on them and saw that they were all wearing uniforms, holding mahjong tiles and other gambling tools, and looked flustered and suspicious. For caution's sake, patrolman Fu first sent a policeman back to the station to inform the 4th Inspection Team of the nearby Garrison Command. Captain Wang of the team then dispatched a team of soldiers to arrest the five men. On the spot, they confiscated a bayonet, a hand grenade, a pistol, and a set of mahjong tiles and pai gow tiles. After taking them back for interrogation, they identified themselves as Qian Baolong, Shi Yongshan, Gu Ping, and Zeng Xianwei. Another man refused to reveal his name. As for why Shen Yi was wandering the streets, they were all evasive. Captain Wang, suspicious of the situation, transferred them to the Garrison Command for interrogation yesterday.

### Using a Prostitute As Cover For Haircut, Swindling A Watch, And Fleeing Far Away; Two Apprentices Unknowingly Fall For The Trap

[Our Report] At approximately 11:00 AM yesterday, two young customers, a man and a woman, suddenly came to the Chunfeng Barber Shop at No. 706, Yunnan Road, Zhongzheng Middle Road. The man, who appeared to be in his twenties, was dressed in a Western suit, while the woman, who appeared to be in her early twenties, was dressed plainly. The owner, Gu Jinwen, cordially welcomed them. The woman sat down for a shampoo, and the man, after a brief combing, told the owner that it was raining heavily and asked if he could send an apprentice to fetch a raincoat with him. Gu then instructed apprentice Dong Yijiang to go with him. When they arrived at the intersection of Xizang South Road and Jinling Road, the customer entered the Yitaixiang Watch Shop. Dong followed him inside. The customer selected a "Guaitike" watch, priced at 80,000 yuan, and said that he did not have enough cash and asked if he could pay with silver dollars instead. After the shop assistant calculated the equivalent, it should be eleven silver dollars. He then asked if he could send an apprentice to fetch the silver. The shop, suspecting nothing, sent apprentice Shen Weimin (a local 18-year-old) with the watch. When they arrived at the corner of the Great World, the customer said to Shen, "You can give me this watch. You can get the silver dollars from Dong when you return to the shop." He then said to Dong, "After you go back, get twelve silver dollars from the madam (referring to the female customer who was getting a shampoo) and give it to him." Shen, who had just come to Shanghai from the countryside, fell for the trick and let him take the watch. After Liang, the apprentice, arrived at the barber shop, he told the truth. Only then did they realize they had been deceived. At this time, the girl who came with him was still getting her hair combed. When questioned, she said, "I am a prostitute, living at No. 14, Fuchang Lane, across the street. Last night, I met this young man and stayed with him for the night. This morning at 10:00, he invited me here to get a shampoo. I really didn't know he was a swindler." After speaking, she had to pay for the shampoo herself and quickly left. Shen Weimin, the apprentice from Yitaixiang, immediately returned to the shop and reported the details of the scam.

### Hua Lian in a Thrilling Match: Three Points Defeat Mai Ling, Li Team and Xinghua Tie, Veteran Donghua Team Defeats Mao Xun

[Our Dispatch] In yesterday evening's basketball league, both the men's and women's groups featured tense and exciting moments. Although Hua Lian defeated Mai Lings with a score of 38 to 32, the situation remained thrilling throughout the 40 minutes, with no moment of stability. In the first half, they looked down on them at 14, leading by only one point. In the women's group, the Xinghua and Li teams battled to a 39-39 tie, each earning one point. In another match, Donghua defeated Mao Xun with a score of 45 to 32.

In the featured match, Hua Lian fielded Fu Jinsheng, Bao Songyuan, Liu Fushan, Wu Chengzhang, and Li Zhenzhong to face off against Mai Lings, who started with Lis, Gao Laifu, Fulaote, Qiaokesheng, and O'Engai. After four minutes of intense play, Mai Ling's O'Engai scored one point due to a foul by Lao Bao. O scored again. Fu Shan's mistake in missing an opportunity and Lao Bao's poor ball handling nearly allowed Lis to score four points under the basket. Amidst the atmosphere, Liu of Hua Lian scored one point on a free throw, and Chengzhang pushed in another ball. Suddenly, Lis became rampant again, stunning Hua Lian. Songyuan managed to add a ball, making it 6 to 5, still one point behind. A Fu missed a free throw and two more shots, causing an uproar. After Mai Ling's Laimusai replaced O'Engai, he scored a point, establishing a balance, from 7-7 to 9-9. Mai Ling's Buleimao replaced Fulaote. Jinsheng scored a clean shot, making it 11-9. Mai Ling gradually felt the pressure, even their usual sharp shooters failing to score at all, highlighting their abnormal performance in shooting. In this state, Hua Lian's panic yielded no results.

Gao Fo Lai and Qiao Kesheng each scored a point, and Lao Bao showed his skill, allowing Hua Lian to barely win the first half 14-13, leading by one point.

In the second half, Jia Zhou replaced Jin Sheng. Their team captain, Lis, remained fierce, scoring a goal immediately upon entering the field. Wu and Le each scored one point on free throws, and Da Li pushed in a point. Gao Fo Lai, Chengzhang, Qiao Kesheng, and Ge You showed signs of strength. Songyuan often found it difficult to score. Lis's throw succeeded, making it 22-21, with Hua Lian only slightly ahead. Lao Bao's two free throws made up for his mistakes. Zhenzhong shot from afar, and Xiao Le followed up, slightly increasing their momentum. Unexpectedly, the situation changed drastically in the last three minutes, with Mai Ling scoring two consecutive goals, making it 36-32. Hua Lian dared not relax. At the end of the 40 minutes, the score was 38-32, with Mai Lings ultimately defeated.

Dong Mao Battle

In the Group A2 match, Donghua faced Mao Xun. The competition between these two teams was akin to a championship game for their group. The five players Donghua fielded had histories spanning over ten years. Chen Xianglong, Cai Yanxiong, Zhou Dayun, and Jia Youliang were all renowned players of the past. Xianglong, already in his forties, was particularly deserving of the title of veteran. In the initial exchanges, they were tied at three, before Donghua took the lead. After ten minutes, they were tied again at nine. Donghua replaced Cai and Zhou with Li Yao and Han Longhai. Comparatively, Mao Xun was at a disadvantage in terms of physique. Donghua's playing style was "strong against the weak, weak against the strong." Understanding both oneself and the opponent would have been the best strategy. Donghua scored eighteen in the first half, while Mao Xun scored half that.

A Cai replaced Longhai, and Dayun adjusted Youliang. This was Donghua's lineup in the second half. There were many humorous moments during the match, but Mao Xun struggled throughout, unable to break out of their dismal situation. Ultimately, the score was 45-33.

Star Li Battle

In the women's group match between Xinghua and Li, Xinghua initially scored five consecutive points. Li's team then began to score. In the first quarter, Xinghua scored ten points, while Li's team scored four. In the second quarter, Xinghua's two forwards became increasingly active. Their center, Wang Shan, was tall, standing out like a crane among chickens. Qian Mengyue's turnaround shots were also impressive. Li's Qian sisters and Yao Silian desperately chased after them. In the first half, Xinghua scored 24, while Li's team scored 16.

In the third quarter, the situation was balanced, with both sides attacking from both the left and right. Li's team was particularly formidable, surprising Xinghua. Zhu Lanzhen fouled out five times, and Wang Ruyu replaced her. The score became even closer. Qian Youping scored a goal, making it 29-28, taking the lead. Mengyue scored for Xinghua, making two consecutive shots in the free throw area. In the third quarter, the score was 32-29, with Xinghua still leading by three points. In the final quarter, both teams fought for every point. Xinghua's forwards made several passing plays. Wang Zhelun's push shots also had their merits. The opponent's two Qians and Yao Silian once closed the gap to half a point. Xinghua's consecutive free throws eased the pressure somewhat. In the last minute, Chu Ping made three of four free throws, tying the score at 39. In the end, Xinghua's Zhelun missed both free throws, and time ran out.

### Women's Basketball Tactics
— Translated and Narrated by Qi Gong

When these tactics are actually applied, the defensive formation in (Diagram) can be transformed into the defensive formation in (Diagram Eight). The defenders should act according to their own judgment, depending on the changes in the situation. The deployment is like (Diagram), but when applied, it becomes the dynamic state of (Diagram Eight).

At the same time, it can be transformed into the formation in (Diagram Nine). The formation in (Diagram Four) can be transformed into the formation in (Diagram Ten) when applied.

In addition to the method of responding to the center circle kickoff, the other three formations (Diagrams Five, Six, and Seven) of the four mobile zone formations are sure to be effective if they can be applied skillfully.

The curved black lines in each diagram indicate the route that the defender must leave their original position and run, after the attacker gains possession of the ball. The basketball has been passed into her zone, and she has the responsibility of guarding the ball and the ball carrier.

Defenders must maintain a uniform distance and connection when defending. If the position of the center defender is too close to the other two defenders, there will be fewer opportunities to intercept the opponent's passes, and instead give the attacker the opportunity to dodge and enter. The result is that two defenders are guarding one attacker, leaving gaps in other areas, and the defender in that area has to guard two attackers alone, which is an excessive burden.

Therefore, it can be reminded from the above that defenders often make the above and the following simple mistakes when adopting a zone defense, causing the entire defense to collapse and failing to produce a defensive effect. The following are common mistakes that defenders tend to make when adopting a zone defense.

(1) After attacker A has passed the ball to attacker B, the defender guarding attacker A still follows attacker A, which is tantamount to adopting a man-to-man defense.

(2) The defender does not focus their eyes on the ball when defending, so they often fail to develop a sense of anticipation and cannot achieve the expected effect of intercepting the opponent's passes.

(3) When moving to defend, the distance is too far, and another area is exposed with gaps. If the attacker suddenly changes to attacking in the opposite area, the defender will inevitably be too late to traverse the court to cover and hinder the attack in that area.

(4) Moving too early – anticipating and judging incorrectly, assuming that the attacker is about to receive a pass from another attacker, the defender rushes forward too early, giving another area the opportunity to break in.

(5) Continuously retreating backwards during movement is tantamount to gradually allowing the attacker to approach and get into a shooting position. The main strategy of a zone defense is to keep the attacker out of easy shooting range, that is, outside the keyhole line. If the defender retreats continuously, they are unconsciously giving the attacker a favorable shooting position.

These are the most common mistakes that beginners make, causing the zone defense to lose all effect. It must also be remembered that if the opponent's attacker is skilled in long-range shooting, then the area defended by the defender should be expanded to the center line.

(6) After each pass by the attacker, the defender still does not move, not moving at all or only moving a few inches. This still will not get the opportunity to intercept the opponent's pass. (To be continued... 6)

### "Delightful" Collection
— Suo Bei

In this day and age, one should think of everything from the "good" side.

For example, hyperinflation certainly hinders the national economy; however, counterfeiters are deterred and disappear, which is a sign of improved national morality. Delightful one!

Furthermore, the train fare is too expensive, and the common people feel that they cannot afford it, and it is inevitable that there will be complaints, but the benefits seem to be even greater:

The order of getting on and off the train has been greatly improved, and there is no more rushing;

Everyone has a seat in the carriage, and they treat each other with respect, and no longer push and squeeze each other;

The driver must stop at each station, and no longer swear at the passengers;

All of these new and good customs that are pleasing to both Chinese and foreign observers can be fully expressed in a short period of time, all thanks to the increase in train fares.

Also: the common people are now able to walk to work, which is in line with the purpose of thrift and health. Delightful two!

Cigarettes are too expensive, and even low-level civil servants can no longer afford them, and they all complain. Who knows that the New Life Movement has not been promoted? People who have quit smoking hundreds of times can now have their wishes fulfilled. Delightful three!

Economic bankruptcy and financial chaos are naturally headaches for people, but there is at least one benefit: economic knowledge such as "cost of living", "money is loose but cash is scarce", and "good money drives out bad money"... has become universally known to the public, and even middle school students know the ins and outs of terms such as "call loan rate", "discount rate", and "rediscount rate". Economic problems that were difficult to explain in the classroom in the past are now no longer a problem. If this continues, everyone will have an economic mind and a talent for business. Why should the country not be rich? Delightful four!

Tuition fees are too high, and everyone says that they hinder the future of education; however, because tuition fees are high and education is difficult, it is enough to make every student in school be vigilant at all times and deeply understand the need to work hard and study hard. Student movements will naturally disappear without a trace, which will greatly benefit the future of education, and there will be many talents who become famous through hard study in the future. Delightful five!

In this day and age, one should think of everything from the "bright side" and look into the distance, and there is nothing that does not make people feel optimistic! Believe it or not.

### Clock
— Yi Shi

You might wonder, what did people use to tell time before the clock was invented?

Thousands of years ago in Egypt, there was a kind of timer, which was a bronze bowl with a small hole in the bottom. When the sun rose, the bowl was floated on the water next to the thoroughfare. Water slowly flowed into the bowl from the hole, and when the water was full, a watchman would strike a gong to indicate that a fixed length of time had passed. When the second bowl was full, he would strike it twice, and so on until the evening. In England, a candle engraved into twelve equal sections was also used to tell time. Six candles were needed to burn out completely in one day and one night, with every three sections being roughly equal to one hour today. The ancient Chinese used clepsydras to tell time, but they were neither accurate nor labor-saving and expensive.

It was not until 1609 AD that Italian scientist Lelio invented the clock using the relationship between the mainspring and gears. This was a major revolution, which was not only accurate and cost-effective, but also sturdy and durable, so it was immediately adopted by the world. However, clock time is not completely accurate due to the influence of geomagnetism and temperature. With continuous improvement, the invention of the atomic clock recently completed a further contribution, with only one second difference every three million years, approaching absolute accuracy.

### Confession of a Recluse
— Zhong Ming

Having lived in seclusion for a long time, my spirit has also been lazy for a long time. When dressing up for seclusion, I thought of taking advantage of this long day of leisure to write a lot of articles. I had drafted some topics, made some plans, but in the end, nothing came of it. Months passed by aimlessly. But that's nothing, because there is nothing in the world, so why bother myself? As for the plans, they were just a joke. The more detailed the plans, the less the results will be. How often have I seen anyone implement according to plan, step by step? So, it is not surprising that I lived aimlessly.

Recently, I ended my life of seclusion and moved to a new environment, and I have a new feeling about everything. When I sit quietly and feel bored, I really want to write something. I remember that my friend Mr. Zhu Zhu had these words in the preface of his collection of poems: "If writing a few articles can make my wife praise them, I would feel very honored; as for being recited by ten thousand people, making the paper in Luoyang expensive, and passing them on to future generations and storing them in famous mountains, I have always regarded these words as myths." This is my state of mind when it comes to writing articles. Moreover, I also think that articles should not be written too well; if they are written too well, the impression they give to others is just that you are a writer, so all the jobs of being an official and getting rich will not fall on you. What they can find you for is just to ask you to write an article. Think about how sad this is?

The interest of being successful is strong, and the interest of being a recluse is faint. It can also be said that success is a kind of dynamic interest, and seclusion is a kind of static interest. I lived in seclusion for a long time this year. I wanted to say "when the stillness reaches its extreme, one thinks of movement," but I just didn't want to move when the stillness reached its extreme. Recently, I moved to this ten-mile foreign market, not because I wanted to move myself, but because others wanted me to move. What is strange is that this movement made me quiet down. At home, there are still friends' gatherings and relatives' visits, but now I live in this area, as if I am living in seclusion in the mountains and forests. The writing room is very large, but there are only three "writers" in total, each occupying a corner. The work is easy, and they sit silently all day long. When I enter the door, I practice sitting meditation first. I have had this kind of experience of eating writing room food before, so I am naturally not surprised. It's just that after 6:00 PM every day, the two friends in the same room have other places to go, and I am often alone in the room, which is a bit terrifying.

After sitting quietly and feeling bored, I also thought of moving. This movement is very simple, which is to stand up and walk around. In the writing room, wandering back and forth, continuous rotation, often walking for half an hour, or even more than an hour. Sometimes I look up at the bright moon from the glass window, and look down at the grass. I can't help but laugh when I think about it in silence. This laughter is not self-satisfaction, but laughing at myself for becoming so docile. In the past, my friends criticized my life as an Eight-legged essay, but I still thought of myself as a prose. Now I think about it, it is neither an Eight-legged essay nor a prose, but simply a Buddhist scripture.

Because I was too idle, I also thought that what I was using my heart for all day long would be used by villains, so I also moved my brain while sitting quietly. Once my brain moves, I have many thoughts, but unfortunately very few can be put into words; because my current life is like a Buddhist scripture, but I have not yet cleansed the six senses. I still want to be a good person, and I want to write down all my thoughts truthfully. I understand very well that writing successful articles cannot feed me, but living a successful life is the way to do it. Writing lighthearted thoughts can be self-satisfying in articles, but this success is useless, and it is not suitable for being a person after all. I have suffered a lot in writing articles over the years. Now I feel that I have made progress - I have the cleverness of "no longer writing articles too successfully".

### Between Victory and Defeat

— Jiang Shangyu

Last week, I went to watch a soccer game where both sides had several quite "well-known" players. The nature of the game was a "friendly match," but the result was anything but "friendly." Eventually, the actions became rough, with players bumping into each other. The audience also cheered and shouted for attacks, almost turning it into a full-scale brawl. After watching, I couldn't help but shake my head and sigh.

Last year, I returned from America and happened to witness the National Games. Although I study agriculture and wear thick glasses, I am very interested in sports, especially soccer, so I naturally didn't miss any of the soccer matches at the National Games. However, from beginning to end, I only saw fighting from start to finish, except for a few games where the strengths of the teams were vastly different. Especially during the final week of the finals, because those teams were all military teams, some even brought cheerleaders carrying handguns. When the two sides entered the field, they looked like they were bloodshot and ready to shoot, making the referees afraid to go down and blow the whistle. The chief referee had to step in himself. Such a strange phenomenon was truly the first time I had seen it. I think it's because the Chinese take the words "win" and "lose" too seriously. I heard that on the eve of the finals, a team leader warned his players, "You must win this game, or don't come back to see me!" What kind of talk is that? It's a bit like "signing a military order" in Peking opera. If both team leaders tell their players "you must win," then who can be asked to lose? Wouldn't that just mean asking the referee to be beaten and admit defeat?

During my years studying in America, I was a standard soccer fan, willing to pay five or ten dollars for a ticket to a game just to understand what was happening. American soccer is not like the one we play; the ball looks like a green olive. When holding the ball, you can bump, block, and press. We usually call it rugby. If they were as hot-tempered as our players, secretly punching or kicking someone every time they moved, then a single game would result in at least half the people being beaten to death. But when they play, they all follow the rules. Although the competition is thrilling and intense, I have never seen anyone punch another player or the referee.

One thing left a deep impression on me and I will never forget it. That year, our school team held an annual game with the Princeton team. Beforehand, our school coach concentrated the players, practiced hard, and studied tactics, preparing for a long time. On the eve of the departure for the game, a swearing-in ceremony was held in front of the team flag. The principal, coach, and team leader all came to the field in person. The ceremony was simple but solemn and grand. Led by the principal, the entire team prayed to heaven. The prayer was very simple, only four sentences, but at the time, it moved me to tears. The four sentences were:

"If we win, let us win gloriously; if we lose, let us lose gloriously."

What a demeanor, what a spirit! Win, and win gloriously; lose, and lose gloriously. This is not only the spirit of playing ball, but also the spirit of how one should live. As a result, our school team unfortunately lost to Princeton by one point. The players and coaches were of course saddened (this is human nature, inevitable), but all expressed acceptance because the opponent was indeed more skilled. In any case, I never saw anyone say they wanted to beat up the Princeton players or blame the referee.

That day, when I returned to the dormitory, an American classmate asked me if Chinese ball games were also like this. I quickly replied, "Of course, of course," and gave the example of ancient Chinese archery, where one had to "bow before ascending and drink after descending; their competition is gentlemanly." There is also an old saying in Chinese society, "Victory is certainly joyful, but defeat is also met with pleasure," showing that China and foreign countries are the same.

At the time, I actually had no intention of lying. But now, if I were to meet that American classmate again, I would definitely blush greatly.

When will we truly have this open and upright mind, "Victory is certainly joyful, but defeat is also met with pleasure"?
