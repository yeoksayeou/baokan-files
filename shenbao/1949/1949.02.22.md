### Acting President Li Changes Flight to Guilin Today; Yesterday Paid Tribute to Huanghuagang Martyrs in Guangzhou; Called for National Unity to Overcome Difficulties

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou Twenty-first Dispatch] Acting President Li, accompanied by Yu Hanmou, Xue Yue, Ouyang Ju, Zheng Yanfen, and others, went to the tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang at 9:00 AM on the 21st to lay flowers. President Sun rushed there, but Acting President Li and others had already finished paying their respects. They met on the way back. At 10:00 AM, Mr. Li appeared among more than 10,000 people in the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall and immediately gave a half-hour speech, reiterating his determination to strive for peace. He also called on people across the country to strengthen unity and overcome difficulties. He praised President Chiang's spirit of great benevolence and courage in resigning, which is admired by compatriots across the country. Finally, he proposed that any party should respect the national people's demand for peace; those who resort to military force will ultimately fail. Mr. Li attended a joint banquet hosted by Yu Hanmou, Zhang Fakui, Xue Yue, and Ouyang Ju at Yingxian Hall at noon. In the afternoon, representatives of the Legislative Yuan stationed in Guangzhou held a meeting, inviting Acting President Li to report on the progress of peace talks. At 5:00 PM, Acting President Li met with the envoys of the Soviet Union, the United States, Pakistan, Britain, India, France, Italy, Burma, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and other countries at his official residence, and the representatives had a pleasant conversation.

[United Press Guangzhou Twenty-first Dispatch] Acting President Li is carrying President Sun Ke's reply back to Nanjing. Whether Mr. Sun is willing to participate in the peace movement or insists on staying in Guangzhou, the content of this reply is still unknown. Guangzhou newspapers expressed pessimism about Acting President Li's visit to Guangzhou, but it cannot be determined whether this reflects official opinion. The local official newspaper, "Guangdong Evening News," praised Mr. Li's intentions but doubted the sincerity of the Communist side.

### The Kuomintang and the Communists Must Restrain Their Emotions and Consider the People's Demands Rationally; Acting President Li's Speech at the Welcome Meeting of Legislative Yuan Members Staying in Guangzhou

[Central News Agency Guangzhou Twenty-first Dispatch] Acting President Li reiterated his confidence in peace at a welcome tea party for Legislative Yuan members staying in Guangzhou on the 21st, resolving to plead for the lives of 450 million people with 100% sincerity, and willing to endure humiliation and bear burdens, doing his best to achieve peace. The welcome tea party was held at Dongyuan, Dongshan, at 3:00 PM. More than 70 Legislative Yuan members attended. After Vice President Liu Jianqun delivered a brief welcome speech on behalf of the hosts, the acting president rose to speak amidst enthusiastic applause. He first stated that due to certain political affairs that required his personal handling in Nanjing after the Executive Yuan moved to Guangzhou, he regretted not being able to come to Guangzhou earlier. He then explained that the government's decision to pursue peace was purely to comply with the national people's will to abhor war and desire recuperation. The acting president also analyzed the objective situation at home and abroad in detail. Because the people of the whole country and even the people of the whole world unanimously demand peace, although difficulties and setbacks are unavoidable, he firmly believes that the achievement of peace is still possible. If all parties and factions can restrain their emotions and make good use of reason, peace will surely be achieved in the end, allowing our country to embark on a path of construction. The acting president recalled that after experiencing eight years of war against Japan, our country was followed by three years of fratricidal strife, the people's livelihood was devastated, and the whole country was plunged into deep water and scorching fire. The people were in great pain and all hoped for an end to the war and the disbandment of troops. In order to comply with public opinion, the government decided to seek peace with the greatest sincerity and effort. Although efforts to promote peace are inevitably met with some difficulties, the general trend is that one day it will be achieved. The government and the people within its domain certainly yearn for peace. Even the people in the Communist-controlled areas deeply feel the pain of war and all eagerly hope for peace. Public opinion cannot be violated, so he firmly believes that the Communist Party must have considered the necessity of a ceasefire and peace talks. Looking at the international situation, peace and construction are the unanimous demands of all people in the world. The civil war in our country is ostensibly only a domestic political problem, but in fact, it is closely related to the safety and security of the whole world. However, the affairs of the Chinese people must be solved by the Chinese themselves. Since war cannot solve the problem, it should be solved by political methods, striving to talk everything out at the table, instead of resorting to arms. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party have accumulated grievances for twenty years, and there is bound to be some resentment in their emotions. However, fratricidal strife is the most unfortunate thing and must be restrained with emotion, using reason to consider the demands of the people and accepting the demands of the people, sincerely seeking the realization of peace. The acting president finally reiterated his personal attitude, saying that he had been in the military for a long time, knew the cruelty of war deeply, and abhorred war. He was unwilling to resort to force except for the sake of protecting the country and defending the people. This peace negotiation was by no means for the sake of the government or himself, but to seek peace for the 450 million compatriots across the country. If this causes any misunderstanding or setbacks, he will definitely endure it. We must endure for the sake of 450 million people in order to achieve peace and achieve the goal of pleading for the people. The Legislative Yuan members who attended the tea party included Liu Jianqun, Gu Zhengding, Jiang Yiping, Zheng Yanfen, Qi Shiying, Shao Hua, Di Ying, Zheng Zhenyu, Chen Bosheng, Zhang Daoxing, Yang Dezhao, Chen Zifeng, Wu Zhimei, Li Mangui, Pi Yishu, and more than seventy others.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Twenty-first Dispatch] After the Executive Yuan moved to Guangzhou to work, emergency withdrawals of funds required by various agencies in Nanjing have recently been submitted to Ni, Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, for approval and disbursement. Mr. Ni felt that the number of items handled in recent days was large and the responsibility was heavy. At the meeting of the joint office of the ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan stationed in Nanjing on the 21st, he specially proposed two points, which were passed by the meeting: (1) When each unit requests an emergency withdrawal, it must first be submitted to the original competent authority for approval. For example, in the case of emergency withdrawals for schools, the Ministry of Education should first be requested for approval. (2) The Ministry of Finance should send important personnel to Nanjing to jointly review and approve emergency withdrawals with Deputy Secretary-General Ni.

### National Army in Northern Shaanxi Withdraws from Tongchuan and Yaoxian According to Plan; Communist Army Decides to Actively Reorganize Troops

[Central News Agency Xi'an Twenty-first Dispatch] The Xi'an Pacification Headquarters issued a battle report on the 21st: (1) The main force of the Communist Army in Northern Shaanxi, the 1463rd Column led by Peng Dehuai, attacked our troops defending Tongchuan and Yaoxian on the 19th. After our troops fought back, they withdrew from Tongchuan and Yaoxian at dawn yesterday (the 20th) according to plan and retreated to advantageous areas, but Yaoxian is still defended by our national troops. (2) The Communist troops who infiltrated near Wangshan have retreated northward to Juhui, ten miles north of Yaoxian, after being attacked by our troops. (3) The move of our troops to withdraw from Tongchuan and Yaoxian has profound implications for ensuring the safety of Guanzhong, and the main purpose is to demonstrate the responsibility for the war with facts, in order to promote the progress of overall peace.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Twenty-first Dispatch] It is reported that the Communist Army in Northern Shaanxi, in its southward advance, claimed that one route would follow the old route of capturing Baoji for the first time to capture Baoji, and the other route would trend towards the area between Tongguan and Xi'an, so as to create an encirclement posture against Xi'an. General Hu Zongnan is giving them a head-on blow. The previous rumor that Hu's troops had entered Sichuan was purely a rumor.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Twenty-first Dispatch] Recently, the Communist Army in Central Plains held an important military meeting, deciding to appoint Chen Yi as the commander of the East Front Corps and Chen Geng as the commander of the West Front Corps, actively reorganizing the troops, and intensively deploying as many as 3,000 ships in the secluded areas of Gaoyou, Hongze, and Chaohu Lakes.

### Qingdao Situation Clarified; Qin Dechun to Take Office Within the Week; Possibility of Unified Leadership

[Our Newspaper Qingdao Twenty-first Dispatch] Sources familiar with the situation revealed that Qin Dechun's delay in taking office in Qingdao was due to (1) the central government's indecision on Qingdao's status in the past, and (2) Mr. Qin's efforts to increase the number of troops of Feng Zhi'an and Liu Ruming stationed in Qingdao to consolidate its defenses. The situation in Qingdao has now been clarified, and there is no problem with the principle of holding firm. The northward deployment of Feng and Liu can be realized. It is reported that Mr. Qin will come to Qingdao within the week. The municipal government's guest house has been renovated to welcome Mr. Qin.

[Our Newspaper Qingdao Twenty-first Dispatch] A well-informed source told reporters that there is currently no sufficient reason to prove that Qingdao needs to take emergency measures: (1) The Communist Army outside the city is weak and has no active intentions. There is peace and quiet for hundreds of miles in Jiaodong. (2) The Supreme Command of the National Army has not completely finalized this move in Qingdao. At least a week ago, it made new considerations. (3) The withdrawal work that must be carried out should have been started early in terms of the situation. As for whether the US military will "withdraw," the facts have already explained it, and there is no need to discuss it further. The US military's "transfer" work can be said to have ended in late last month, but it still maintains the presence of warships in the harbor and announces the stationing of a very small number of personnel to indicate that it has not "withdrawn." Unless Qingdao falls into the hands of the Communist Army, this meaning will continue to exist. The US military will never imagine using the Qingdao military port in the hands of the Communist Army, so it will never casually use the word "withdrawal" until the last moment to observe the changes in the situation. The person also said that Ramsay's repeated emphasis on using the word "transfer" in his reports to Chinese and foreign reporters seems to be consistent. As for the National Army, the withdrawal of military dependents has been largely completed. Some personnel of the pacification zone have gone south. The military explained that the purpose of this move is to dispel the concerns of the officers and soldiers on the front line. However, the southward movement of industrial and military materials and the contraction or informal dissolution of military, political, and financial institutions will gradually make Qingdao a purely military defense stronghold. Some local people believe that after Chadchun comes to Qingdao, the possibility of a unified leadership will be greatly increased. The person also said: After receiving a certain order, the military authorities once formally and publicly expressed the future trend of Qingdao's situation to the persons in charge of various relevant institutions, and then reserved the previous meaning, which made the order in Qingdao tense and chaotic for several days. The reporter learned that this move made the relevant institutions, especially financial institutions such as the Central Bank, feel confused, because they cannot coordinate their business and invigorate the economic lifeline unless they receive clear instructions. However, the situation has greatly eased in recent days, the spot exchange rate has been rapidly shortened, and the market situation has gradually become normal. The withdrawal plan of the central government agencies in Qingdao was started several months ago, but it was not carried out under the instructions of the highest military and political organs here. The well-informed source finally told reporters: Qingdao is currently quite stable, and all kinds of speculations and concerns are still too early and not helpful to the actual situation.

### Sino-Soviet Negotiations; US Expresses Concern

[United Press Washington Twentieth Dispatch] Official sources reported on the 20th that the United States is extremely concerned about the current Sino-Soviet negotiations, which may give the Soviet Union long-term mining and trade rights in northwestern China. The reporter stated that if these talks are successful, Xinjiang Province will be incorporated into the Soviet sphere of influence and violate the terms of the Sino-US Commercial Treaty approved by the Chinese government in November of last year. Little is known here about the Sino-Soviet talks that are taking place in the capital of Xinjiang Province. However, reports from China claim that these talks will lead to the signing of a 40- to 50-year agreement giving the Soviet Union the right to mine gold, silver, copper, iron, coal, and other minerals.

### Chongqing Garrison Headquarters Director Zhang Qun Takes Office, Expressing Earnest Words, Repeatedly Emphasizing that the Grand Strategy of Peace or War Will Obey Central Orders, and Measures Have Been Drafted to Stabilize the Southwest Financial Industry

[Our Newspaper Chongqing 21st Dispatch] Zhang Qun, accompanied by Qian Dajun, went to the Garrison Headquarters in the same car at 9:30 AM on the 22nd. At 10:00 AM, the inauguration ceremony was held in the auditorium. Liu Wenhui, Wang Lingji, Deng Xihou, Yang Sen, He Guoguang, Qian Dajun, Jing Yisu, and Sichuan-Chongqing provincial and municipal council speakers Xiang Chuan'yi and Fan Zhongqu, along with hundreds of others, stood in front of the stage to listen to the speech. Zhang first stated: He had served as the director of the Rong-Yu Executive Headquarters three times and once concurrently served as the chairman of Sichuan. Returning to Sichuan this time for more than ten days, he deeply felt the great responsibility. He had been listening to reports from all sides these days, reviewing the situation, and considering solutions. He believed that the current situation in the southwest requires more local assistance, concentration of manpower, and thorough cooperation, seeking progress through reform, and saving oneself, the hometown, and the country. He repeatedly emphasized that the grand strategy of peace or war would obey the central government, and that more responsibility should be taken for stabilizing and protecting the southwest. He urged people not to be intimidated by the current environment, to strengthen their faith, to unite sincerely, and to grasp the demands of the people, stating that the southwest definitely has a solution. Zhang affirmed "seeking innovation and change," which is the common desire of people, but concrete manifestations are few, the reason being rooted in ingrained habits of following old ways, perfunctoriness, and conservatism, preserving the status quo, and the vested interests of the privileged class overemphasizing their own interests and freedom, while their desire to dominate and occupy forces others into a dead end. Zhang frankly told the attendees to reflect on why intellectuals are increasingly criticizing the government or not cooperating with it. The current situation requires changes not only in military failures, but also in politics, economics, society, and psychology. Regarding how to stabilize southwest finance, ensure self-sufficiency in materials, and the suggestions of some individuals to plan the southwest as a separate economic zone, Zhang stated that he has invited relevant leaders to brainstorm ideas and formulate measures, and after the central government's economic policy is announced, they will coordinate with the plan to complement each other. What can be told now is: (1) Land reform should be properly planned and decisively handled; (2) A property tax will be implemented; (3) Redundant institutions will be cut, and expenditures will be tightened; (4) Exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies will be abolished, and special donations will be collected from wealthy households. Regarding the collection of grain for land tax, it was decided to adopt the opinions of the participants to stop collecting in kind at the end of this year and restore the collection of currency, so as to reduce the harassment of the people. As for the collection of military and public grain, separate measures can be formulated. Zhang's speech lasted for three quarters of an hour. He appealed that unity is strength. All emotional rifts, ideological discrimination, conflicts of rights, misunderstandings leading from secret struggles to open contention, are enough to cause both sides to suffer. Sharing peace and happiness is easy to conflict, but sharing adversity is easy to cooperate. In the future, prejudices should be eliminated, and the will of the people should be followed to work together. He also frankly admitted his own mistakes, otherwise, without the Communist Party seeking liquidation, he himself would collapse. After the speech, he stepped down, shook hands with the leaders and chatted, and invited them to a tea party.

[Our Newspaper Chongqing 21st Dispatch] Sichuan Council Speaker Xiang Chuan'yi, today at Zhang Qun's inauguration ceremony, represented the guests in his speech. He hoped that peace would be realized soon, and that politics would be reformed, people's hearts would be won back, and the southwest's defense capabilities would be strengthened, and especially hoped that the southwest authorities would be consistent in their steps. Yu Council Speaker Fan Zhongqu also gave a speech, requesting Zhang Qun to immediately invite the leaders of the five provinces and cities of Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Yu to hold a meeting to self-examine the reality.

[Our Newspaper Chongqing 21st Dispatch] Important personnel adjustments in the Garrison Headquarters: Deputy Chief of Staff Liu Zongkuan concurrently serves as the Director of the Third Division, Zhou Junliang is appointed Director of the Office, and Yuan Jinji is the acting Director of the Fourth Division.

[Our Newspaper Chongqing 21st Dispatch] Han Renmin, Deputy Commander of the Sichuan Military Control Zone, after requesting instructions on military administration at 2:00 PM on the 21st, flew from Yu to Rong. It is reported that the Sichuan province's conscription quota may be reduced, and both conscription and recruitment will be used.

Editorial

### Starting with the Mindszenty Affair

US Minister to Hungary Chapin was recalled to the country to report on his work. On the 18th of this month, he passed through Paris and made a statement to reporters, saying: "Hungary, especially the government, is still continuing to arrest Roman Catholics. Since arriving in Paris from Hungary, I feel very happy to breathe the free air of France. As for the situation in Hungary, it is unimaginable, beyond description. Anyone in Hungary, unless blind, can easily see that the Hungarian people are under the complete control of the Communist Party and do not know what their lives are like." We have never been very clear about the actual situation in the countries behind the Eastern European Iron Curtain. Even regarding the trial of Hungarian Cardinal Mindszenty, before understanding the truth, we were somewhat reserved and unwilling to make hasty judgments. But today, after synthesizing information from all sides, the truth has become clear. At the same time, a Bulgarian government newspaper also announced that fifteen pastors will be tried for treason and espionage. We really can't help but comment. Because if the practice of depriving religious freedom continues, many bishops, priests, and pastors of Catholicism and Christianity, as well as many monks of Buddhism, in China will also face the same fate in the CCP-controlled areas.

Cardinal Mindszenty was arrested by the Hungarian government in Esztergom on December 26 last year. According to a statement issued by the Hungarian government, he was arrested on two charges: (1) engaging in espionage activities, attempting to conspire to betray the government; (2) illegally trading foreign currency. Six other people were also arrested at the same time. At that time, because the case was complicated, the outside world did not know the truth, but the Hungarian government's attempt to eradicate the influence of Catholicism among the people was obvious. Therefore, upon hearing the news, both Paris and the Vatican were shocked and hoped that the Hungarian government would conduct a trial as soon as possible to clarify the case.

However, the Hungarian government delayed again and again until early February this year before starting the trial. During the first court session, the prosecutor suddenly abandoned the fundamentals and did not question the above two charges. Instead, he stated that Mindszenty had secretly written to US Minister to Hungary Chapin in prison, asking him to lend a hand to save him from drowning and escape from Hungary by plane. When Mindszenty answered, his voice was low and his response was vague. The court immediately announced that he had "directly admitted to it." The intention of the Hungarian prosecutor's move was very clear: In short, it was to expand the incident, turning it from a domestic event in Hungary into an international event. On February 5, the court session continued. British and American people requested to attend the hearing but were refused by the Hungarian authorities. The British and American governments protested but were ignored. Therefore, all freedom-loving people with a sense of justice are worried about Cardinal Mindszenty. Sure enough, within a day or two, the Hungarian prosecutor announced that the case was established, filed a public prosecution, and demanded the death penalty. The reasons they cited were: 1. Mindszenty led an organization that conspired to overthrow the Hungarian government, thereby helping the Habsburg royal family to restore power; and expected the third world war to break out soon, so he contacted American intelligence personnel, and the United States has long wanted to manipulate Hungary economically and politically. Therefore, Mindszenty's actions were actually based on an imperialist organization to help the United States dominate the world."

This public prosecution was submitted to the Hungarian People's Court, which, after a brief interrogation, sentenced Mindszenty to life imprisonment on February 8 and confiscated all his property. This barbaric and illegal behavior of the Hungarian government almost aroused public outrage in various countries around the world. Not only Paris and the Vatican expressed dissatisfaction, but London and Washington were also very angry. British members of Parliament immediately visited Foreign Secretary Bevin after hearing the news, requesting the British government to formally protest to Hungary; public opinion in the United States was even more filled with passionate emotions. Even the Hungarian people did not approve of it. Because the country is under the strict control of the Communist Party, it is impossible to express their opposition. However, Hungarians abroad have made tangible protests against this inhumane and anti-religious action. The resignation of the Hungarian Consul in New York, Balassa, is a perfect example.

Even without standing on the "religious freedom" standpoint, seeing the Hungarian government persecuting Catholics in this way, one cannot help but sympathize with Bishop Mindszenty. In recent years, the Soviet Communist government has also indicated that people can obtain religious freedom, but after seeing the Mindszenty incident, one can suddenly realize that "religious freedom" within the Iron Curtain is entirely a self-deception by the Communist Party. US Secretary of State Acheson made a statement to the press on February 9, denouncing Hungary's persecution of the church. He said, "This move is actually the Hungarian government, manipulated by the Soviet Union, persecuting the church regardless of conscience in order to remove its anti-communist moral force." He also said, "The Hungarian people have no real freedom to speak of." Secretary of State Acheson's remarks were the most pertinent, and President Truman also expressed his agreement. Therefore, although the Mindszenty incident itself has passed, the consequences of this incident, which are sufficient to affect the world situation, are developing and may deepen the rift between the East and West worlds. We hope that all freedom-loving people in the world will be vigilant about this event that violates "religious freedom."

Secondly, many people now have illusions about the Communist Party, thinking that there is real freedom behind the Iron Curtain. Therefore, in the context of the recent smooth military development of the CCP, they also have some hope for the "democracy" and "freedom" promoted by the CCP. Even American journalists or church people have recently often reported that the CCP authorities in various places do not seem to be persecuting the church very much. We, of course, also hope, with a "desire to be good to others," that the CCP will not be completely closed within the Soviet Iron Curtain and that their practices will be different from those of the Communist parties in Eastern European countries. However, who can guarantee that the CCP will not copy the old articles of the Communist parties of Hungary and Bulgaria and other countries after stabilizing the situation in the controlled areas?

### US Aid Cotton Resumes Shipping to China, First Batch Arrives in Shanghai Early Next Month

[US Information Service Shanghai News] Under the initiative of Leighton Stuart to resume the aid of 95,000 bales of American cotton to the Chinese textile industry, this campaign has been successfully completed. The Washington headquarters of the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) recently announced that the shipment of American cotton will resume immediately.

Griffin, who temporarily served as Acting Deputy Director during Stuart's visit to Washington, said: "As a result of Director Stuart's concerted efforts, the thousands of families who depend on Chinese textile factories for a living can continue to be employed, and the textile factories can continue to produce. The newly approved 95,000 bales of cotton to be shipped to China, as well as the American cotton that has already been shipped, can guarantee that the factories can operate for another two months. The local and foreign raw cotton purchased by the Chinese side during the transition period is not included in the calculation."

20,000 bales of cotton have now been shipped to China, and the first batch of 2,500 bales will arrive in Shanghai on March 7. The ECA has handed over 300,000 bales of cotton to China. The Joint Office for the Distribution of Cotton Yarn and Cloth, which handles the distribution of American cotton, has allocated 184,000 bales of ECA cotton to various factories, and the factories have returned 86,000 bales of yarn and 35.5 million yards of cloth. The yarn and cloth are sold domestically or exported, and the foreign exchange earnings are used to purchase more raw cotton.

[Agence France-Presse Washington 20th Dispatch] A key decision-maker in the Economic Cooperation Administration's policy said here today that the US government is now considering the possibility of extending the decision on any new economic aid plan to China to July 1.

### Pang Shusen Resigns as Chairman of Jiangsu Provincial Assembly, Sends Telegram to Ding Zhipan Attaching Three Requests for the People from Chen Weimin: Stop Conscription, Rectify Military Discipline, and Prohibit Illegal Arrests

[This City News] The position of Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Assembly has been approved by the Executive Yuan to be succeeded by Pang Shusen. It is learned that Pang has declined due to insufficient energy. He has telegraphed the Executive Yuan and Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Ding to request resignation. The original telegram to Chairman Ding also includes three requests for the people from Chen Weimin. The original telegram is recorded as follows:

"Zhenjiang Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Ding Xunjian: According to the report, the Executive Yuan meeting has approved the appointment of Pang Shusen as the chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Assembly. Upon hearing the news, I feel very apprehensive. Shusen has served the local community for forty years. In the past twenty years, although I have been in a retired state, I will still devote myself to local public welfare. However, I have long been tired of my political career. Now, I suddenly hear about the appointment, and I think that I do not have this talent in public and I do not have enough energy in private. The seat of the chairman is difficult for Miao to bear. In addition to the telegram to the Executive Yuan, I will also telegraph the situation again, respectfully requesting you to quickly re-appoint a capable person to preside over the seat. The utmost prayer is. I have also seen the recent situation in the region, and there are things that must be requested for the people. I respectfully attach them: (1) The conscription system is full of malpractices, and the people are complaining. Driving these young adults who are thinking of escaping before the battle to face the crisis of a hundred cracks will only spoil things. This conscription should be stopped. (2) Currently, in various counties in Jiangnan, there are garrisoned troops and military families arbitrarily occupying people's houses, as well as schools and factories, forcibly conscripting boat troops, harassing the local area, and demanding huge supplies. Although this is done by a few undisciplined people, the people's resentment can be heard everywhere. This military discipline needs to be rectified urgently. (3) Recently, during the peace talks, it was heard that arrests of young people and students were still occurring in various places, which violates the central government's intentions and the provisions of the law, and is not enough to show the sincerity of the peace talks. These illegal arrests should be strictly prohibited. The above three points are the most serious suffering of the people, and should be improved immediately. Shusen will still contribute his humble opinions as a member of the people at any time for selection. I pray for your clear understanding. Pang Shusen Kouchou (Ge)"

### Regarding the North Atlantic Security Treaty, Britain Does Not Insist on Military Guarantees; Seven-Nation Negotiations Expected to Proceed Smoothly; Norway Decides to Join the Treaty; Sweden Greatly Disappointed

[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st] Well-informed sources say that British Foreign Secretary Bevin has sent a new instruction to the British Ambassador to the United States, Franks, regarding the Atlantic Treaty. Bevin instructed Franks to assist in accelerating the process of the treaty in the following ways: (1) Do not insist in the treaty that the United States must provide military assistance guarantees in the event of war; (2) Current negotiations should be limited to seven countries, with other countries joining later. Sources close to the government pointed out that if the Western powers relax their position slightly, the draft can be completed next month and signed in late March or early April. It is also said that British experts are now considering whether it is possible to sign two other treaties: (1) a Mediterranean Treaty and (2) a Pacific Treaty. Authorities believe that these two treaties will be discussed after the Atlantic Treaty is signed.

[United Press, Washington, 21st] Diplomatic officials say that an important decision in the negotiations on the North Atlantic Treaty is expected to be reached this week. At the same time, this historic treaty is very likely to be signed within a month. High-level consultations between countries and within Congress are scheduled to be held this week. These consultations may be the most important since negotiations began last July. They said that Secretary of State Acheson will meet with the ambassadors of Canada, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. The information discussed by the seven countries will then be submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for review, and other similar meetings will follow. Officials said that unless unexpected obstacles are encountered, this week's meetings may make the remaining negotiation work a routine technical matter of wording. The hope of signing the treaty has been expanded due to the support of Republican policy leader Senator Taft. Taft said he supports a North Atlantic Treaty similar to the Western Hemisphere Defense Treaty signed in Rio de Janeiro in 1947. The Western Hemisphere Treaty stipulates that an attack on any American country will be considered an attack on all American countries.

[United Press, Washington, 20th] Well-informed diplomatic sources say that Norway may participate in the North Atlantic Treaty negotiations within ten days. It is said that a formal invitation to Norway will be issued after the Norwegian Parliament formally approves joining the Western alliance. It is reported that the powerful Norwegian Labor Party overwhelmingly supported the treaty last night.

[Central News Agency, Stockholm, 20th, United Press] Swedish Prime Minister Erlander said today that given Norway's decision to join the Atlantic Treaty, Scandinavian defense negotiations are now impossible. Sweden is well aware that the people of every country should decide their own foreign policy based on their own historical foundations. The division of the three Scandinavian countries is truly a matter of unhappiness for the three countries. [United Press, Copenhagen, 20th] Denmark still adopts a cautious attitude towards the Atlantic Treaty. Denmark is at a loss among its Scandinavian allies. Sweden is undermining this treaty, while Norway is preparing to join.

### Draft of the Egyptian-Israeli Armistice Agreement Completed; Signing Imminent Upon Approval in Cairo; Dispute Remains Over Beersheba

[Our Report] New York, 21st Broadcast: Cairo News: A senior official of the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the claim reported from Haifa that the Egyptian-Israeli Armistice Agreement has been signed on Rhodes is not true.

[United Press, Rhodes, 21st] The delegation representing the country flew back to Cairo today with the draft of the Egyptian-Israeli Armistice Agreement to seek instructions from its government. According to delegation leader Edin, Egypt will decide its position on the Beersheba issue no later than the 22nd.

Although the Israeli delegation has accepted the entire agreement, the Egyptian side has not yet agreed on the section regarding the disposition of Beersheba. According to unofficial sources, the draft agreement generally recognizes the current boundaries. Israel shall not use Beersheba as a base, but may station troops there. In addition, it stipulates the exchange of prisoners of war and the permission for Egypt to pass through Israeli territory along designated routes to withdraw troops stationed in Jerusalem and the Falujah pocket area. Beersheba is located in the southern Holy Land and is the birthplace of the Arab nation. It has been occupied by Jewish forces since last October. However, according to the UN General Assembly partition plan in 1947, it is not within Israeli territory. The area is strategically important, with highways converging, east to Transjordan, south to Egypt and Saudi Arabia, west to Gaza, and north to Jerusalem, all concentrated here.

### Austria Firmly States that Borders Are Not Allowed to Change; Four-Power Conference Reopens

[Agence France-Presse, Vienna, 20th] Austrian Chancellor Figl declared today that Austria will never agree to changes in its national borders or to compensation exceeding what we can afford to pay. We will only accept a treaty that makes Austria a free and independent country. It is hoped that the foreign ministers' representatives now meeting in London can now end the situation that makes Austria free but not liberated.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st] The four-power foreign ministers' representatives reconvened this morning to discuss the Austrian peace treaty issue. Representative Radebrunner said that there is no reason to be overly optimistic about the outcome of the meeting. He stressed that two important issues, the issue of Austrian assets claimed by the Soviet Union and the future of the Danube Steamship Company, have not yet been resolved. He also said that even if Yugoslavia is willing to take a compromise approach to Austria, Austria will never compromise on the border issue.

[United Press, Capital of Bolivia, 21st] After President Handoso announced yesterday that he had uncovered a conspiracy by exiled opposition leaders to overthrow the government, the political situation remains chaotic.

The first defendant was out on bail and did not appear. After Zhou Naihao testified, the court adjourned and rescheduled the trial. The facts alleged in the case are as follows: On March 15th of last year, the first defendant, Sha Sailan, had a verbal dispute with Zhu Xu, a woman in the Reformatory, due to work-related reasons. Sha used a butcher knife to stab Zhu Xu, causing serious injuries. Afterward, Sha colluded with Zhou Naihao and, under the guise of sending her to work for the Relief Association, sent Zhu Xu to Beijing through Zhou in an attempt to destroy evidence. Later, a neighbor, Yin Jin, reported the above situation and the fact that Huang Wang in the Reformatory had been beaten and miscarried to death. The District Prosecutor's Office initially ruled not to prosecute, but the plaintiff applied for reconsideration. The High Prosecutor's Office ordered the District Prosecutor's Office to conduct an investigation, which resulted in the prosecution of both defendants on charges of assault.

### The Green Team's Female Warriors Widely Known - Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Invite Them to Compete

[Our Newspaper] It is not uncommon for men's basketball teams from this city to compete abroad, but it is rare for women's basketball teams to travel abroad, except for the Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team, which crossed the sea to the east some time ago. The Green Team's women's basketball team has been a force in this city for many years, and their skills and accomplishments are superior to those of the Liangjiang team, and their reputation has spread overseas. The Philippines, the base of basketball in the East, has also been impressed by the name of the Green Team and has the intention of inviting the Green Team to compete in the South. The Manila Youth Association's new building was completed, and during the winter overseas Chinese leader Lin Zhuguang from Minbu wrote to Qian Xucang, chairman of the Municipal Basketball Committee, requesting that a team be formed to compete there. Qian immediately recommended the Green Team, but most of the players in the team were unable to go due to work or school commitments. It is heard that the Filipino representative in Hong Kong entrusted Cai Jindian, a player in this city, to contact the Green Team. Cai proposed two solutions: (1) Cai himself would be the coach, or (2) the Green Team would select nine players, and Cai would select the rest. This was not agreed to by the Green Team. Recently, several overseas Chinese in Shanghai have said that the Hong Kong women's basketball team is a big draw, and that it would be more profitable to go abroad, and are actively seeking to contact players. In addition to basketball skills, the players' appearance is also a condition. There are major questions about their intentions in organizing the team to go abroad and about the prevailing atmosphere in women's sports. When applying for permission to go abroad in the future, it is hoped that the Municipal Sports Association and the Basketball Committee will give serious consideration. Even if the Green Team eventually goes abroad, it is necessary to have careful planning and training beforehand regarding the deployment of personnel, the state of women's basketball in the Philippines, and the use of men's and women's rules. It is impossible to act rashly. Since it is going abroad as a representative team from this city, it must be done in this way.

### Chamber of Commerce Asks Ministry of Industry and Commerce to Promulgate Measures to Supplement Capital Conversion

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to Minister Deng of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday at the request of the Sauce and Pickle Commercial Association, asking him to promulgate measures to supplement the registration of changes in profit-making enterprises' capital converted to Gold Yuan as soon as possible. The telegram stated: After the promulgation of the revised measures for the issuance of Gold Yuan on November 13 of last year, the original measures for registration of changes were no longer appropriate. The Ministry had formulated eleven supplementary measures for the conversion of operating capital to Gold Yuan and, to gather opinions, Minister Deng of the Commerce Department of the Ministry sent a draft of the supplementary measures. The Association submitted six suggestions on December 25 of last year requesting their adoption. The original deadline for supplementary registration of changes, originally set for May 19, 1949, was proposed to be extended by three months to August 19, 1949. Article 2 of the supplementary measures, which stipulated that the amount should be uniformly increased by five times, was requested to be changed to an increase based on the price index announced by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics for the previous month. The Association's letter stated that its original suggestions were included in all of the above, but two months have passed, and these supplementary measures have not yet been submitted by the Ministry to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. Furthermore, the deadline for registration of changes as stated in Article 3 of the original measures for registration of changes issued on October 20 of last year, which was February 19, 1949, has long since passed. If the provisions in that article are followed, and enterprises that have not registered changes are to be dissolved, liquidated, and have their licenses revoked, this would cause great turmoil and go against public opinion. Therefore, the Association has submitted this telegram to the Ministry for consideration, requesting that the supplementary measures for registration of changes, in accordance with the Association's suggestions, be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation as soon as possible for compliance and implementation, as it would be beneficial to all.

### Central Mint Opens Silver Coin Minting

Weight of Seven Mace One Fen Eight Per Coin

The long-rumored currency system reform has been confirmed by a financial authority. The new coin to be released will be a silver coin, with the same design as the old silver coin issued in 1934, with Sun Yat-sen's portrait on the front and a sailboat on the back. The fineness of the silver coin is comparable to that of the Yuan Datou, weighing seven mace one fen eight. According to sources, the Central Mint may start minting silver coins from this week, but it will take a considerable period before they circulate in the market. The reform of the currency system must be formally approved by the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan has now moved far away to Guangzhou, and there are in fact many difficulties in deciding on this important matter, so it will still take some time.

The rumor that the Central Mint is minting half-yuan silver coins is, according to reliable sources, a misinterpretation of one-yuan silver coins. The reporter inquired with relevant authorities at the Central Bank at 5:00 PM yesterday, and it was said that the minting of silver coins is for the purpose of new economic reform. The new economic plan still needs to be agreed upon by all parties before it can be implemented.
