### Acting President Li to Broadcast Tomorrow Evening: Reaffirming Resolve for Peace Talks
### With Communists, Yan Huiqing and Shao Lizi Fly to Beiping This Morning

[Our Own Correspondent] Nanjing Broadcast from San Francisco, 12th: Acting President Li will deliver an important broadcast tomorrow evening, reaffirming the government's determination to seek peace with the Communist Party. It is expected that Acting President Li's broadcast speech will strongly reaffirm the government's unwavering determination to achieve peace. This statement will clarify the misunderstanding regarding recent reports from Guangdong that the government intends to continue fighting. These reports claimed that Acting President Li had agreed to Sun Ke's war policy. Acting President Li's broadcast is expected to emphasize that the government's primary goal remains peace.

[Our Own Correspondent] Gan Jiehou received a long-distance call from Beiping yesterday afternoon, requesting the peace delegation to fly to Beiping today. Gan informed Yan Huiqing yesterday evening at 6 p.m. to notify all delegation members to prepare for departure. This morning, the representatives gathered at Yan's residence at 9 a.m., as previously arranged, to wait for the plane to Beiping. Shao Lizi is traveling on the same flight. They will exchange views with key figures of the Chinese Communist Party.

[Our Own Correspondent, Nanjing, 12th] Regarding Zhang Zhizhong's resignation as a peace talk representative, the Presidential Palace had not yet received a report as of the 12th. According to political figures, Zhang's resignation was likely submitted to the Executive Yuan, as the peace talk representatives were appointed by the Executive Yuan. The reason for Zhang's resignation is unknown. It is reported that Zhang has claimed illness while in Lanzhou. It has been observed that the Chinese Communist Party has recently launched many attacks on the peace talk representatives, including Zhang. At a time when the future of peace is still difficult to predict, the criticism of the peace talk representatives may be the main reason for Zhang's resignation.

[Our Own Correspondent, Nanjing, 12th] The assurance given here today by Ye Jianying of the Chinese Communist Party to the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation, promising that the Communist Party would agree to hold peace talks within this month and would not attack Nanjing, Shanghai, or areas along the Yangtze River before the final outcome of the peace talks is decided, shows that the nationwide people's eager call for peace has made it impossible for the Communist Party to ignore national public opinion. However, it is generally believed that excessive optimism about the future of peace is not warranted until the Communist army officially orders a ceasefire. According to various indications, the Communist army north of the Yangtze River is actively preparing for replenishment. However, Ye Jianying's statement that they will not attack Nanjing, Shanghai, and areas along the Yangtze River within a month should be considered credible. This morning, Qiu Zhizhong of the People's Peace Delegation met with Acting President Li to report on the discussions with the Chinese Communist Party in Beiping. Qiu verbally conveyed the views of the Chinese Communist Party brought back by the delegation during the meeting.

[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] According to sources, General Ye Jianying has assured the Nanjing Professor Peace Delegation that the Communist Party will agree to hold peace talks within this month and will not attack Shanghai, Nanjing and areas along the Yangtze River before the final outcome is decided. The message stated that Ye asked the delegation to convey "several necessary conditions" to Nanjing for starting peace talks. However, the nature of the "necessary conditions" was not disclosed, but it was stated that they included a demand to stop war preparations. The delegation also gained the following impressions in Beiping: (1) The Communist Party believes that Li Zongren is not strong enough to represent the Kuomintang in the negotiation of a peace agreement and will cause internal divisions within the government. (2) The Communist Party is willing to make certain modifications to the demand to "punish war criminals." (3) The Communist Party will not demand the detention or trial of President Chiang. (4) The Communist Party will remove harsh conditions regarding the reorganization of government troops. Wu Yu later quoted Ye Jianying as saying, "If the Kuomintang sincerely seeks peace, the Chinese Communist Party is willing to make peace happen as soon as possible." Wu also revealed that Ye Jianying and other Communist leaders have handed over detailed peace conditions to the delegation to be conveyed to the government. Wu said that the delegation will publish a full report "at an appropriate time."

### Dai Chuanxian Passes Away in Guangzhou Due to Excessive Sleeping Pills
### Central Standing Committee Discusses Funeral Arrangements Yesterday

[Our Own Correspondent, Guangzhou, 12th] Dai Chuanxian, a senior member of the Party and the State, passed away suddenly at 8 a.m. on the 12th at Dongshan Dongyuan in Guangzhou. It was found that he had been suffering from heart disease and needed to take sleeping pills every night to fall asleep, as had been the case since coming to Guangzhou. Last night, he may have taken too many sleeping pills, which affected his heart. After the discovery this morning, the director of the Medical College of Zhongshan University first attempted to rescue him, followed by the director of the Municipal Health Bureau, Zhu Guangtao, but it was too late. The Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang held a meeting at 4 p.m. to discuss funeral arrangements. On the day before his death, he had expressed his intention to enter Sichuan. His sudden passing has shocked those who heard the news.

[Our Own Correspondent, Nanjing, 12th] It has been learned here that Dai Chuanxian, the former President of the Examination Yuan, and his wife took sleeping pills together and fell asleep the night before his death. Dai did not wake up at 8 a.m. on the 12th, and his wife is still receiving treatment in the hospital.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th] Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, and Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan, learned of the critical condition of Dai Chuanxian, a senior member of the Party and the State, before leaving Guangzhou on the 12th. They made a special visit to his bedside as he was dying, lingered for a long time, and sadly said goodbye. Yu could not help but shed tears, feeling infinite grief in his heart.

A Brief Biography of Dai

Dai Chuanxian, also known as Jitao, was from Wuxing, Zhejiang, and was born in Guanghan County, Sichuan. At the age of fifteen, he went to Japan to study. Three years before the founding of the Republic of China, he graduated from Nihon University. After returning to China, he served as an instructor at the Jiangsu Local Self-Government Research Institute for one year. During the Gengxu and Xinhai years (1910-1911), he served as the chief writer for the Shanghai Zhongwai Daily, Tianduo Bao, and the Penang Guanghua Bao, advocating revolutionary ideas. While in Penang, he joined the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance). When the Wuhan Revolution broke out, he returned to China and devoted himself to the revolutionary movement in the Northeast. In the first year of the Republic of China, he served as the chief writer for the Minquan Bao. At that time, Sun Yat-sen presided over the national railway affairs and appointed him as his secretary. The following spring, he accompanied Sun to Japan. In the winter of that year, the campaign against Yuan Shikai failed, and he went to the Northeast to plot revolution. Failing again, he went to Japan to help Sun Yat-sen organize the Chinese Revolutionary Party, serving as the branch leader in Zhejiang and the chief writer for the Minguo Zazhi (Republic Magazine). In the fifth year, he returned to China with Sun Yat-sen. In the sixth year, he served as the Secretary-General of the Grand Marshal's Office and the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. In the eighth year, he founded the Shanghai Weekly Review and assisted Sun Yat-sen in presiding over the Construction Magazine with Hu Zhantang, Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Zhixin, and others. In the eleventh year, he returned to Sichuan under the order of the Premier to persuade the various armies to cease fighting and develop industries. In the twelfth year, after the establishment of the General Headquarters, he was appointed concurrently as the Chairman of the Legislative Committee by the Grand Marshal. In the thirteenth year, the Kuomintang was reorganized, and he was elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee, the Minister of Propaganda, and a member of the Central Political Committee at the First National Congress. In the fourteenth year, the National Government was established, and he served as a member of the National Government Committee. In the fifteenth year, he served as the Chairman of Zhongshan University. In the spring of the sixteenth year, he was sent to Japan as an envoy. After returning to China, he was reassigned as the President of Zhongshan University, and also served as a member of the Propaganda Department, a member of the Central Political Conference, and the Director of the Political Training Department of the General Headquarters. In the seventeenth year, he was elected as a member of the National Government Committee and the President of the Examination Yuan, until the Constitution was promulgated in the thirty-seventh year, when he resigned after the establishment of the Presidential Office. In the eighteenth year, he also served as the Minister of Training. In the twentieth year, the Central Organization established a special foreign affairs committee, and he served as the chairman. At the Fourth National Congress, he was re-elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee and a member of the Political Conference. In June of the thirty-seventh year, he succeeded Zhang Ji as the Director of the National History Museum. His writings were numerous, but many were lost. His most famous works include "The Philosophical Foundations of the Three Principles of the People," "The Road of Youth," "The National Revolution and the Chinese Kuomintang," and "On Japan," which were loved by young people. His son, Anguo, studied electrical engineering in Belgium and is currently the Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Communications.

### Trygve Lie Says He Doesn't Object to UN Mediation in Chinese War
### Australian Foreign Minister Considers Formally Proposing Suggestion

[United Press, Lake Success, 11th] It is learned that Australian Foreign Minister and President of the United Nations General Assembly, Evatt, is considering suggesting that the United Nations mediate to resolve the Chinese civil war. According to reports, Evatt has not yet made a final decision on this matter. Sources from the Australian delegation here said that they have not received instructions from Evatt requesting United Nations mediation, but that Evatt discussed the possibility of United Nations mediation in the China issue with United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie earlier this month via long-distance telephone. Lie and Evatt cooperated at the end of last year to try to resolve the Greek civil war and the Berlin crisis. However, this time Lie was noncommittal about Evatt's suggestion, but Lie hinted that he did not object to Evatt requesting United Nations mediation in his capacity as Australian Foreign Minister. According to reports, Evatt will take office as President when the General Assembly opens on April 5. Australian sources claim that Evatt believes that "if China's long and tragic war harms the entire country and delays reconstruction and recovery, this is a right that the suffering people of China should enjoy. If we strictly adhere to the principles of the United Nations and assist in mediation to promote an agreed peace, it will save countless lives." If Evatt makes this suggestion, he seems likely to request mediation under Article 14 of the United Nations Charter, which states that the General Assembly may recommend peaceful adjustment measures for any situation.

### "President Chiang's State of Mind" - Editorial in Nanjing Central Daily Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The Nanjing Central Daily's editorial on the 12th, titled "President Chiang's State of Mind," reads in full as follows:

A dispatch from Xikou says that President Chiang returned to his hometown for the New Year. During this early spring, he walked from Xikou to Fenghua County and visited Tiantong Temple, paying homage to the Cold Fragrance Pagoda of his former monastic friend, Ruzhi Toutuo. As President Chiang walked, he received the respect and cheers of the residents of the villages and towns. President Chiang's mood was pleasant and serene, unlike anything he had experienced in thirty years.

Since President Chiang left Nanjing on January 21, comrades in the Party have often wondered about President Chiang's future plans. We believe that to answer this question, we must first understand President Chiang's outlook on life, and second, we must understand President Chiang's current position. If we have a correct understanding of these two points, we will not make incorrect and unnecessary speculations about President Chiang's actions.

President Chiang has always been consistent in his conduct and actions, always starting from a sense of duty and responsibility. In his early years, he followed Premier Sun, regardless of position, seeking no fame, only seeking to do his best for the revolution. In 1924, Premier Sun founded the Whampoa Military Academy and appointed Chiang as its president. Despite severe difficulties in funding and ammunition, he cultivated the backbone of the National Revolutionary Army, completed the unification of Guangdong, and launched the Northern Expedition. Before the split between Nanjing and Wuhan, Chiang did not dwell on his achievements and withdrew to promote the unity of the Party. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, whenever there were disturbances, even if he had to use force, the result was always a peaceful resolution due to Chiang's tolerance and concession. After the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident), Chiang resigned for the second time to awaken national unity against foreign aggression. After the victory over the Communists in Jiangxi, he promoted their joint efforts to resist foreign aggression through peaceful, political methods. When the War of Resistance against Japan initially ended, the prestige of the National Government was unprecedented in history, and President Chiang, in his capacity as Chairman of the National Government, sent a telegram to the Chinese Communist Party, inviting Mao Zedong to Chongqing to discuss the great plan of peaceful nation-building. This was followed by the Political Consultative Conference, where he first proposed a plan to reorganize the National Government and end the period of political tutelage, fully demonstrating the spirit of forbearance for the sake of the country. After the Chinese Communist Party destroyed the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the military reorganization plan, they launched a full-scale rebellion, creating a dangerous situation of military disaster. President Chiang then issued a statement on New Year's Day this year, reiterating the policy of peaceful resolution, and resigned for the third time to facilitate the start of peace talks. Looking back on President Chiang's fifty years of revolutionary experiences, especially his major decisions on advancement and withdrawal, it proves that everything he did was based on a sense of duty and responsibility. As long as we have a correct understanding of this, it is not difficult to know that President Chiang, on the one hand, values the independence of the country and the freedom of the people, and on the other hand, purely observes, calmly trusts, and supports the government from an unofficial position. This is exactly the mindset and demeanor of a politician in the opposition in a democratic country. Any speculation beyond this is wrong and unnecessary.

President Chiang's current position is even clearer. His presidential powers have been handed over to Vice President Li in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of China. However, he is the Director-General of the Chinese Kuomintang. He continues to lead the comrades in the Party to strive for the National Revolution. To make the Party's current position easier to understand, it is best to compare it to the current position of the British Labour Party. Today, the Labour Party is the majority party in the British Parliament, and Attlee has formed a cabinet as the leader of the majority party. However, Professor Laski, the leader of the Labour Party, does not participate in Parliament or the cabinet. Our Party is the same today. Our Party is the majority party in the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan. Vice President Li, as a comrade of our Party, is acting as President, and President Sun, as a comrade of our Party, is forming a cabinet. The Party affairs of our Party are guided by President Chiang. As long as we understand this point, it will not be difficult to understand President Chiang's current position.

We must point out here that the current problem of our Party is organizational disarray, spiritual depression, and defeatism prevailing among general comrades. The fundamental cause of the current political failures and military setbacks lies in this. If the Party's illness cannot be cured, then dealing with the current political and military problems in a piecemeal manner will never lead to the revival of the nation. President Chiang is now able to transform our Party from an unofficial position, following the precedent of Premier Sun's reorganization of the Chinese Revolutionary Party in 1913, so that it can once again assume the responsibility of saving and building the country. This is the fundamental principle of the National Revolution. We hope that all comrades will unite and move forward in this direction around President Chiang.

### Presidents of Yu and Tong Arrive in Shanghai,
### Each Convenes Provisional Legislative Committee Seminar, President Sun's High Blood Pressure Prevents Him from Going North

[Our Own Correspondent] Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, and Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan, arrived in Shanghai by special plane from Guangzhou at 3 p.m. yesterday. President Yu is scheduled to convene a meeting of the Shanghai-based supervisors of the Control Yuan at the Control Yuan's Shanghai office today to discuss the issue of the Control Yuan's relocation to the south. After the meeting, President Yu will travel to Nanjing. After arriving in Shanghai, President Tong attended an informal discussion held by local legislators and reported that the transportation, accommodation, and food issues for legislators in Guangzhou had been largely arranged and that they hoped that legislators in Nanjing and Shanghai would travel south as soon as possible. In order to gather opinions from all sides, President Tong has scheduled a seminar with all Shanghai-based legislators on the 15th of this month at the Shanghai-based legislator's office to discuss everything in detail. It is reported that most of the legislators in Shanghai have no preconceived notions about the relocation of the Legislative Yuan to the south and are willing to consider the current needs of the country, strive to enhance unity, and overcome difficulties together. President Tong also revealed that Wu Tiecheng will come to Shanghai in the next few days. Sun Ke, however, will not come because of his high blood pressure of 224 degrees, which prevents him from enduring long-distance flights. However, Sun and Acting President Li are both loyal to the country and have no grudges against each other. All rumors are speculative.

[Our Own Correspondent, Guangzhou, 11th] Legislators from various places are now arriving in Guangzhou one after another.

### Sudden Chaos in Qingdao City, Although the Periphery is Calm, People are Quite Tense, Financial Situation is Barely Maintaining, Lack of Capital

[Our Own Correspondent, Qingdao, 12th] Although the periphery of Qingdao is calm, the city has been quite chaotic for several days. Gunshots are heard everywhere at night, and robberies occur frequently. Small and large institutions only have empty signs hanging, and most of the heads of the institutions have left Qingdao or are preparing to leave Qingdao. Those who remain in Qingdao also have no official business to handle. The financial industry is barely maintaining the situation, but there is a lack of capital, and business is sluggish. Major construction projects are underway outside the pier, and materials and luggage are piled up like mountains on the pier. The Pacification Zone Headquarters requisitioned the Jingxing and Haisu ships for official use, and the second batch of dependents sailed to Xiamen on the 12th. The citizens of Qingdao have been plunged into a battlefield of nerves. They were previously concerned about whether the U.S. military would withdraw, and now they are asking whether the National Army will withdraw. Flour has fallen to 1,500 yuan a bag, less than two U.S. dollars, and no one wants it. Movie theaters are still open as usual, showing five screenings a day, and are packed with people. Auction houses, which were once very popular, are now also experiencing sluggish transactions. This morning, the National Army on the periphery test-fired cannons, which startled the citizens. The general public sentiment is "both nervous and numb."

[Our Own Correspondent, Qingdao, 12th] Air transport to Taiyuan suddenly ceased at 12:00 midnight on the 12th, reportedly due to a lack of gasoline. It is not yet certain whether it will resume.

[Our Own Correspondent, Qingdao, 12th] The China National Aviation Corporation suddenly announced its withdrawal on the 12th.

Another three columns are stationed in the triangular area of Quanjiao, Chaoxian, and Hexian. Four columns are stationed in the area of Liuhe, Tianchang, and Xuyi, serving as the headquarters of Xu Shiyou, the "Commander of the Shandong Corps of the East China Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," who is in charge of the battles in the southern section of the Jinpu Railway and the areas on both sides, with headquarters stationed in Zhangbaling.

[Our Own Correspondent, Puzhen, 12th] Sun Zhongde's unit of the Communist army recently forcibly requisitioned a large amount of military grain from the people in the area of Chaoxian, Wuwei, Hexian, and Hanshan. At the same time, they are also investigating civilian houses, recording those with large houses and few people, in preparation for the arrival of large forces. Also, the Hefei Garrison Commander is Cao Shengde, and there are currently about 30,000 Communist troops stationed there. A portion of them has gone south along the Gongsheng Highway through Shucheng. However, Tongcheng, which shields Anqing, was once invaded by local Communists on the 8th of this month, but has been officially recovered by the National Army since the 10th. Therefore, the situation in Anqing is now gradually stabilizing.

### The Issue of Troops Stationing in Schools

— Zhou Junshang

The Xiang Army of the late Qing Dynasty marked the beginning of private armies in modern China, but Zeng Guofan, with great magnanimity, disbanded the Xiang Army after the recapture of Nanjing. The Huai Army trained by Li Hongzhang was quite different. They considered themselves masters of their own fate, and even Zeng Guofan found it difficult to command them as he wished. It took the help of the Li brothers, and he told Li: "My humble request is not to force you and your brother to do something difficult, but it is because I see that the Nian rebels cannot be eliminated without the Huai braves, and the Huai braves cannot be led without your family." This shows that the Huai Army under Li's command had essentially formed a private army. Later, Yuan Shikai passed on his mantle to the descendants of the Huai Army, which turned into the Northern Warlords of the late Qing and early Republican era. The armies controlled by the warlords were lecherous, plundering, and lawless, causing universal grief and indignation.

In the past, the Chinese people were alienated from the military, even regarding them as tigers and wolves, partly because the armies were privately owned and brought disaster to the country. Since the National Revolution, all armies have been called the National Revolutionary Army, or the National Army for short. The army began to have a relationship with the country and its people. All activities of the National Army were for the sake of the country, and all sacrifices were for the sake of the people, following the orders of the country and the demands of the people to defend the country and protect the people. During the eight-year war of resistance against Japan, the army was more progressive than society in general, and even more progressive than politics. The general society and political circles lacked the sense of urgency of the military, their sense of duty was far inferior, and their lifestyle was even worse. Soldiers could fulfill their duty to risk their lives, while government officials and social figures could not contribute to the country as much as the soldiers.

Today, we see a handful of corrupt officials, powerful families, and treacherous merchants making "national crisis fortunes," "victory fortunes," and recently "contingency fortunes," making money everywhere. However, the vast majority of the people suffer the hardships of national crisis, the hardships of victory, and the hardships of contingencies, suffering everywhere. The government is unclear about right and wrong and indifferent to this situation, which has aroused resentment in society, intentionally or unintentionally directed towards the military. In reality, the income of soldiers (especially the income of enlisted soldiers) is so low that they are barely surviving, filled with resentment, and discipline is inevitably somewhat lacking as a result.

Many problems naturally arise from poor discipline. The stationing of troops in schools is one consequence of poor discipline. Schools in major cities near the front lines have mostly been occupied by stationed troops or troops passing through. In theory, when troops arrive in a place, they should report to the local military authorities and then negotiate to borrow suitable premises for accommodation. Nowadays, there are quite a few people who do not follow this procedure and barge in recklessly. When they occupy schools, they first send armed personnel to negotiate. While many have a good attitude, there are also those whose behavior is intolerable. The schools, of course, initially refuse politely with reason, but the momentum is fierce and impolite. As the saying goes, "A scholar cannot reason with a soldier," leaving school personnel with nothing but tears. Under the pressure of "You must lend, whether you want to or not," schools become ownerless and powerless. At first, they only said they would borrow it for a day or two, but later they stayed indefinitely. At first, only one or two hundred people would stay, but later it was more than seven or eight hundred. At first, the troops were guests, but later they became the masters. Everything within the school is at their disposal. Sometimes even the principal is questioned when entering or leaving, and the school becomes like a military camp.

The stationing of troops in schools has created two serious problems: one is anti-education and the other is anti-military service. Many schools have been unable to open or hold classes due to the stationing of troops, creating tens of thousands of out-of-school children for the next generation out of thin air. In a peaceful place, is it not contrary to the commander's will of "education first" to suffer such a disaster of being out of school? In addition to being anti-education, what will be the end result if the military does not listen to the commander? Moreover, it is inevitable that the actions of a few soldiers in the school are not a good example for young children. Not to mention the usual matters of water use, electricity use, cooking, excretion, and cleaning, there are also special problems. A student from a school in Shanghai reported that the cook was keeping firewood to sell to the student cafeteria. Also, on February 8th, in the middle of the night, the doorman of a school in Shanghai was slapped more than twenty times and forced to kneel down because he got up half-awake in the middle of the night and broke the key in the lock, delaying the opening of the door. The next day, public outrage was aroused, and the student union held a meeting to voice their grievances, almost causing a major incident. Fortunately, the school authorities persuaded them to stop, and it was temporarily calmed down.

The situation of being unable to attend classes can be exemplified by Shanghai. Today, at least thirty schools in Shanghai have been partially or completely borrowed by the military. With an average of six hundred students unable to attend school in each school, this means that 20,000 people are out of school. With each person missing six hours of class per day, 20,000 people will waste 120,000 hours of study every day, which amounts to 3.6 million hours per month. In other words, if the military occupies more than thirty schools and suspends classes for a month, it is equivalent to 150,000 days of being out of school, which is equivalent to a loss of more than 416 years of time. This is only the loss in one corner of Shanghai in one month. If the current situation continues to drag on, the losses nationwide will be incalculable. What can be used to redeem this kind of loss?

It is harmful and not beneficial to have troops stationed in the city. It is a last resort for troops to enter the city if they cannot go to the countryside or retreat to the suburbs. Cities have more temptations, customs and general life are not as simple as in the suburbs and rural areas, and firewood, rice, oil, and vegetables are also much more expensive. Now, there are troops in Shanghai stationed in Gezhi Middle School on Wuma Road, which is a red-light district with many brothels, which is especially unsuitable. No wonder six soldiers ran away from the school last time. The next morning, one of the deserters was caught and severely punished. Students and school staff witnessed this scene and spread the news everywhere, which is definitely not good news for military service. The soldiers' food is still very bad, some only eat rice with salt water, without any vegetables. This is not a good influence on the students either.

In the past, Zeng Guofan believed that the Green Standard Army was corrupt and vulnerable, so he trained the Xiang Army himself. One important criterion for recruiting soldiers was that they should not be wandering rogues, but only "strong, honest, and simple villagers." He wrote to Peng Xiaofang and Zeng Xiangmei: "Do not recruit frivolous people, but seek those of the soil," and all slippery people were eliminated. Today, the National Army comes from the countryside and should stay away from cities to preserve their integrity. Shanghai is a frivolous place, with people from all over. If troops are stationed in the urban area for a long time, they will easily become slippery and weak. This is something that those who lead troops must consider carefully. Reports say that "military discipline should be thoroughly rectified, and military police and the constitution should jointly form a law enforcement team," which is enough to prove that there are already problems with the soldiers. However, law enforcement teams and disciplinary teams are still temporary solutions, not fundamental ones. The fundamental solution is to stay away from urban areas and conduct strict training.

Military training should emphasize "instruction" over "practice." Zeng Guofan said in a letter to Admiral Zhang Shiqing: "I am afraid that once the people's hearts are gone, they cannot be recovered. I vow to train a brigade that will not commit the slightest offense, in order to restore the people's hearts and silence their mouths. Every time there is a drill on the 3rd and 8th, I gather the braves and teach them, repeating it thousands of times, only to ensure that they do not disturb the people... so that they can gradually change the undisciplined state of military officers." Such training, with the "bitter heart and dripping blood of the cuckoo," will slowly turn into an army with faith. I remember during the Pacific War in World War II, when British troops in Hong Kong were stationed in theaters and other public places, the damage to tables and chairs and the consumption of water and electricity were investigated and compensated in full. This kind of reasonable measure had a great impact on the training of the army and the allegiance of the people.

Troops withdrawing from urban areas and leaving schools is beneficial to military service and education. This is self-evident. Otherwise, we sympathize with the current situation of the military and cannot but borrow some schools, but the minimum requirement for staying in schools is that it does not hinder classes and does not live in the classrooms. Sleeping in corridors, maintaining order, and paying attention to cleanliness, are these not things that can be done? With a heavy heart, we appeal to the officers of the National Army to save military service, save education, spare the schools, and spare the next generation.

### Not to Incite Anti-American Movement; Academic and Labor Circles Demand Expulsion of Two American Journalists

[United Press Peiping 12th dispatch] The anti-American movement in Peiping is gradually gaining momentum. This movement was triggered by the Communist Party's news agency asking the people of Peiping to respond to the "insult" of United Press reporter Musa and Associated Press reporter Lyons. It is claimed that Musa said: "Peiping welcomes the Communist army in the same way it welcomed the Japanese army, the American army, and the Kuomintang in the past." In fact, Musa did not make this report. Lyons said: "The people of Peiping welcome the Communist army with reservations." Radio stations have also joined the attack, publishing talks by people from all walks of life published in the Communist mouthpiece "People's Daily," mostly demanding the expulsion of the two journalists, while some believe that an apology would suffice. It also called the United Press and Associated Press tools of American imperialism. The Peking University Student Union denounced Musa and Lyons as small fish working for Wall Street tycoons, warned them that they would suffer the consequences, and demanded that they leave China as soon as possible. A People's Daily editorial said: "American imperialists dream of conquering the world."

When Americans come to China, they beat us up once they get drunk." Peiping students are scheduled to hold a rally on the 13th to celebrate the arrival of the Communist army in Peiping, and it is expected that there will be more accusations against American imperialism.

### Luo Er Makes a Statement in Honolulu: The United States Has No Plans to Withdraw Troops from Japan; If War Breaks Out in the Far East, the United States Will Be Sufficient to Handle Any Aggression; The Importance of Alaska is Further Highlighted

[Honolulu, United Press, 10th] U.S. Secretary of the Army Royall returned home after meeting with MacArthur in Tokyo and inspecting U.S. military defenses in the Pacific. Today, he revealed this matter and declared at a press conference that if war breaks out in the Far East, the United States will be capable of handling any aggressor in Japan. However, he believes that if there is a war in the Far East, it will not involve the United States. When asked if the United States plans to withdraw troops stationed in Japan if it goes to war with the Soviet Union, Royall replied that he was unaware of any plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops in the area. MacArthur and he both believe that the United States will be able to handle any aggression in Japan. MacArthur's achievements in Japan have been remarkable, and the government does not plan to transfer him. Royall also stated that the entire army will be reduced by 25% in June due to budget constraints, in order to economize on military spending. The position of Alaska is extremely important, and he hopes to improve the equipment of the garrison and formulate a reasonable plan to address the future military situation. Okinawa is also an important base, and a large number of U.S. troops should continue to be stationed there.

[Washington, United Press, 11th] A spokesperson for the Department of the Army declared on the 11th: He was instructed to announce that the reports in Tokyo newspapers that the United States would withdraw from Japan without a fight in the event of a conflict with the Soviet Union are completely unfounded. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on reports from senior military strategists.

[Washington, Agence France-Presse, 11th] American military officials generally believe that the plan prepared by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff to deal with possible aggression is based on: (1) preserving Europe and the Near East; (2) using these areas as a springboard for counterattacks. In any new world conflict, Japan will assume the role of a "defensive fortress."

[Tokyo, United Press, 12th] Prime Minister Yoshida today declined to comment on reports that Japan will occupy a secondary position in the U.S. defense plan. He only stated that he does not fear Japan being invaded, nor does he believe that war will break out in Europe. As long as MacArthur is in charge of the occupation, his task is to maintain order and relieve the United States of the burden of Japan's economic reconstruction.

[Our News] London, 12th Radio: The British Foreign Office stated that the British Embassy in Tunisia is currently investigating rumors of a change in U.S. policy toward Japan with the U.S. State Department.

[London, United Press, 12th] Former British naval and army commanders in the Far East stated on the 12th that the rumored U.S. plan to withdraw from Japan "is strategically sound." They unanimously believe that U.S. policy should currently focus on ensuring Japan's neutrality, rather than military bases on Japanese territory. This view is shared by Lieutenant General Percival, former commander of British forces in Malaya, and Admiral Layton, former commander of the British Far East Fleet.

### Marshal Eisenhower Takes Office as Truman's Military Advisor to Assist the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Deciding Strategic Issues

[Washington, United Press, 11th] According to the White House on the 11th, Marshal Eisenhower has been temporarily recalled to advise President Truman and assist the Joint Chiefs of Staff in deciding comprehensive strategic issues. Assistant White House Press Officer Ives stated that this five-star general will serve as the president's and Forrestal's "chief military advisor and consultant." In addition, he will also serve as chairman in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he has already taken office on the 7th.

Ives stated that Eisenhower's service in Washington will be of a relatively temporary nature, and he has taken a leave of absence from Columbia University for seven to eight weeks. White House and Department of Defense officials both deny that Eisenhower was recalled due to the worsening of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. A Department of Defense spokesperson stated that his greatest task will be to "unify the Joint Chiefs of Staff's opinions on basic strategic issues and handle the accumulation of 'routine' official business" related to the three services. It is reported that the Navy and Air Force have extremely divergent views on who will be in charge of strategic bombing. Eisenhower will also resolve disputes between the Navy and Air Force over the allocation of the defense budget.

### Eisenhower's Comeback is Extremely Welcomed in the Philippines

[Manila, Agence France-Presse, 12th] A spokesperson for the Philippine Presidential Palace stated that President Quirino warmly welcomes Eisenhower's appointment as a U.S. military advisor.

The spokesperson also reflected the views of Philippine military leaders, stating that they believe Eisenhower will have deep sympathy and understanding for Philippine military issues and status, as he himself served as MacArthur's Chief of Staff in the Philippines before the war from 1935 to 1937.

### Anti-Tito Movement: It is Rumored that the Cominform is Holding a Meeting to Organize a New Balkan Alliance

[London, Agence France-Presse, 11th] The sudden dismissal of Markos, commander-in-chief of the Free Greek forces, has aroused various rumors here. One theory is that this is the first minor sign of a large-scale Comintern intelligence operation aimed at overthrowing Tito and organizing a new Balkan alliance, with Prime Minister Dimitrov as its leader. According to British sources spreading this rumor, the following changes are expected: (1) Appointing supporters of Stalin as leaders of the Greek Communist Party, because Markos is considered too nationalistic. They will agree to cede Greek Macedonia, including Thessaloniki, to the Balkan alliance. (2) Engaging in propaganda and organizing a Balkan alliance including Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Albania. (3) Strengthening the anti-Tito movement in Macedonia. Cominform propagandists will allow Macedonians to organize a Greater Macedonia, and the rise of anti-Tito elements may allow Macedonia to secede from Yugoslavia, which could lead to the downfall of Tito's regime.

### Canadian Prime Minister Arrives in Washington to Discuss North American Joint Defense; Norwegian Foreign Minister Completes Mission and Returns Home Via Britain

[Washington, United Press, 12th] President Truman met with Canadian Prime Minister Laurent today to hold informal discussions on Canada's participation in North American defense. Laurent arrived here on the evening of the 11th at Truman's invitation. This is his first visit to the United States since succeeding as Canadian Prime Minister last November. During his two-day stay here, he will also meet with Secretary of State Acheson, other cabinet members, and congressional leaders. Although his visit is officially considered to be social in nature, Laurent has indicated that he will raise the future of U.S. bases in Newfoundland during his talks here.

Based on a wartime agreement with Britain, the United States enjoys the right to lease three strategic air force bases in Newfoundland for 99 years. Newfoundland will become a province of Canada on May 31st of this year. Canada recognizes the U.S. right to lease these bases but hopes to place these bases under joint U.S.-Canadian management based on the defense agreement signed by the United States and Canada in 1947. U.S. and Canadian officials also predict that commercial issues and the planned North Atlantic Treaty will be discussed. Laurent himself has long been a strong advocate for the treaty. Truman and Acheson may inform Laurent of the progress of the treaty negotiations, including the results of recent talks with Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange.

[Washington, United Press, 11th] Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange has concluded discussions with the U.S. government on the North Atlantic Alliance Treaty. Lange is scheduled to fly to London tonight and will depart for his home country after visiting the British Foreign Secretary. Before his departure, he met with U.S. Secretary of State Acheson for ten minutes and issued a joint communiqué stating that "the Norwegian Foreign Minister came to the United States to seek information on the North Atlantic Treaty. He had a frank and detailed discussion with the U.S. Secretary of State on the goals and nature of the alliance and provided opinions on Norwegian security issues. All aspects have been carefully considered, but no decisions have been made."

### Inukai Faction of the Democratic Party Decides to Join the New Cabinet

Most of the New Cabinet's Personnel Have Been Tentatively Decided

[Tokyo, New Asia News Agency, 12th] Yoshida's new cabinet will be formed within three to four days, so the new prime minister's investiture ceremony will be held in the Imperial Palace at the same time as the appointment ceremony for the new cabinet members. Regarding the Democratic Party, regardless of whether internal divisions occur within the party, the Inukai faction has decided to cooperate with Yoshida to complete the conservative coalition government. In the future, two or three Democratic Party members from the Inukai faction may join the cabinet.

[Another Dispatch] The work of forming the third Yoshida cabinet in Japan has now begun. On the morning of the 12th, Yoshida met with Ohno and Hirokawa to discuss the matter. It is reported that Hirokawa has already prepared a list of new cabinet members and chairmen of various committees of the Diet and submitted it to Yoshida for reference. Yoshida seems to have indicated that he can accept this list, but a final decision can only be made after Democratic Party President Inukai Ken submits his party's list of candidates to join the cabinet. It is said that the list submitted by Hirokawa includes Oya Shozo (Finance), Masutani Hideji (Justice), Hayashi Joji (Health and Welfare), Mori Kota郎 (Agriculture and Forestry) or Shuto Hideo to continue in their posts. Masuda Koshichi (Labor, continuing in his post), Aoki Takayoshi (Chief of the National Police Agency), and Ozawa Sajo喜 (Chief Cabinet Secretary). This list still leaves several vacancies for the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Communications, Ministry of Construction, and State Ministers, so that members of the House of Councillors or the Democratic Party can be considered. According to Hirokawa's suggestion, the position of Foreign Minister in the new cabinet should still be held concurrently by the Prime Minister, so that the Prime Minister can have more direct contact with MacArthur Headquarters.

### Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister Sends a Letter to the Four Powers Conference, Does Not Mention Compensation Claims Against Austria; Yugoslavia's Shift Towards the United States to Seek Assistance is Quite Subtle

[Our News] London, 12th Radio: Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister Bebler sent a letter to the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference today, which did not mention compensation claims, which is considered noteworthy here. This is because previous negotiations on the Austrian peace treaty broke down due to Yugoslavia's insistence on compensation of 150 million U.S. dollars and border disputes. Bebler's letter revealed that he first consulted with U.S. representative Libel. The fact that the Yugoslav representative consulted with the United States first instead of seeking assistance from the Soviet Union is highly valued here.

After the rituals were performed, hundreds of peace pigeons were released on the balcony of the venue by the China Victory Homing Pigeon Association amidst the music, flying randomly. Photography reporters competed to take pictures as a symbol of the imminent arrival of peace. After the opening speech by the temporary chairman Xu Ji, guest Supervisory Committee member Ni Bi delivered a speech. The opening ceremony ended at 3:20 PM. The preparatory meeting and the first general meeting followed immediately. First, Xiang Changquan, the temporary Secretary-General of the meeting, reported on the preparation process of the National Peace Promotion Association. Then, the agenda of the meeting was approved, and an 11-member presidium was elected. The list is as follows: He Chengjun of the Hubei Provincial Council, Pei Mingyu of the Shandong Provincial Council, Wang Lu of the Nanjing Municipal Council, Zhang Qiang of the Zhejiang Provincial Council, Tang Siyao of the Beiping Municipal Council, Pan Gongzhan of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Wang Xiaolai of the National Federation of Commerce, Du Yuesheng of the National Industrial Association, Zhou Xuexiang of the National Federation of Trade Unions, He Yuanming of the Free Professional Groups, and Lv Xiaodao of the National Women's Association. Xu Ji was the Secretary of the meeting, and Xiang Changquan was the Deputy Secretary-General. The examination of proposals for the meeting was undertaken by the presidium, and the declaration was also decided to be drafted by the presidium and submitted to the meeting for discussion.

Because it was still early after the end of the preparatory meeting yesterday, the first general meeting was held immediately. The presidium temporarily nominated He Chengjun, Speaker of the Hubei Provincial Council, as chairman. Because Mr. He's illness had not fully recovered, he declined the nomination. Therefore, Pei Mingyu, Speaker of the Shandong Provincial Council, was nominated as chairman of the meeting. After a brief speech by the chairman, the temporary motion of Huang Tong, representative of the Shaanxi Provincial Council, was first discussed, recommending representatives to visit Mr. Yan Huiqing and others in Shanghai who represent the people for peace. Subsequently, it was passed that the presidium should handle the matter. Then, according to the agenda, Guo Weiping, Deputy Speaker of the Gansu Provincial Council, Zhang Weiguang, representative of the Liaoning Provincial Council, Jin Songpan, Standing Director of the National Medical Association, Shen Hongpeng, representative of the Qingdao Municipal Council, Xuan Chuanjing, representative of the National Automobile Industry Trade Union, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, and others successively reported and gave speeches. The first meeting was adjourned at 5:30 PM.

After the adjournment, the presidium convened a meeting and mutually nominated Speaker He Chengjun as chairman. Immediately, Pan Gongzhan, Pei Mingyu, and Wang Xiaolai were nominated as representatives of the association to visit Mr. Yan Huiqing, expressing the earnest expectations of all the representatives of the National Peace Promotion Association for Yan and others to go north. They sincerely hope that the sincere desire for peace of the people nationwide, especially the urgent need for an immediate ceasefire, can be fully stated to the CCP authorities, striving for them to accept public opinion, issue a ceasefire order, and appoint representatives as soon as possible to begin peace talks. The entire association is eagerly awaiting good news and is willing to be a supporter. Mr. Yan expressed his acceptance and promised to convey the message to Mr. Zhang Shizhao and Jiang Yong.

The association will continue to hold its second general meeting from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM today (13th) to discuss the proposals. The third general meeting is scheduled to be held from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM tomorrow (14th), and the fourth general meeting will be held from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM that afternoon, followed by the closing ceremony.

### The People's Indisputable Duty to Mediate Disputes: Xu Ji's Opening Speech Presents Three Points of View

The following are excerpts from the speeches of Xu Ji, Ni Bi, Guo Weiping, Wang Xiaolai, and others: Xu Ji said in his opening speech: Today is the opening day of the National Peace Promotion Association. I remember that a month ago, Speaker Pan and I initiated an invitation to the speakers and deputy speakers or responsible representatives of the provincial and municipal councils across the country, the directors or standing directors of national professional organizations, and representatives of national women's organizations to come to Shanghai to solemnly convene a national peace promotion meeting standing on the people's position, in order to jointly discuss how to promote a peaceful solution. At that time, we believed that stopping the war was the unanimous desire of the people across the country. Shanghai has been the site of several peaceful unification conferences in our country since the Xinhai Revolution, and the successful historical facts are still fresh in our memories. Moreover, its convenient transportation and the attention of China and foreign countries are especially conducive to the peace movement. Therefore, we dared to initiate the invitation to hold a meeting in Shanghai. Fortunately, representatives from all over the country have come to Shanghai to participate despite the long journey. On behalf of the Shanghai Municipal Council, I would like to express my gratitude to everyone.

Since the initiation of this meeting until now, for a period of one month, the government authorities have gradually adopted various measures to seek peace. President Chiang, in order to comply with public opinion, issued a New Year's Day message, advocating peace, and on January 21st, he took the lead in resigning in order to eliminate the scourge of war. After Acting President Li took office, he more actively sent representatives for peace negotiations to contact the CCP to discuss the time and location for talks. Recently, he also allowed Mr. Qiu Zhizhong and other gentlemen from Nanjing and Mr. Yan Junren and other gentlemen from Shanghai to fly to Beiping as private individuals to discuss peace issues with the CCP authorities. All of these demonstrate the sincerity of the government in seeking peace, which has been seen by the people of the world. As for the CCP, we have heard in the broadcasts of the CCP's responsible authorities that they are also very willing to resolve disputes through peaceful negotiations. The only problem is the so-called "preparations are not yet ready." In principle, whether it is the government authorities or the CCP authorities, if everyone truly thinks for the people, then there should be no problem in resolving disputes peacefully. Therefore, we should be optimistic about the future of peace. However, what exactly is the key to why peace negotiations cannot proceed smoothly now? Peaceful unification is indeed what everyone wants. Heaven sees as the people see, heaven hears as the people hear, and the people's likes and dislikes are already obvious. None of our common people do not hope for the early realization of peace, and the government and the CCP have not said that they do not want peace. Why can't peace be realized immediately? From the perspective of us people, what kind of peace do we need? I believe that we people all have the right to criticize and advocate. As long as we people do not give up our own rights, anything cannot be contrary to the unanimous will of the people across the country.

Secondly, if the peace talks between the government and the CCP can begin, there may be disputes along the way, then the responsibility of mediating disputes, we local representatives of public opinion, professional representatives, can represent the needs of the people to make choices. Therefore, since peace is the key to the survival of the people's lives, then the responsibility of mediating disputes, we people also have an indisputable duty.

Since We Want to Talk Peace, We Don't Need to Fight Anymore

Furthermore, in terms of the lives of us common people, the country has resisted the aggression of Japanese imperialism for eight years, followed by three years of civil war. What has been sacrificed is nothing more than the lives and property of the common people, and the country's vitality has reached a point where the people are in dire straits and the country is in a state of irreparable ruin. If the war does not stop again, I am afraid that the Chinese nation will truly face the crisis of extinction. Therefore, we feel that we must not only shout "peace," but we are almost shouting "save our lives." Because we want to save our lives, we also advocate that since we have to sit at the conference table to talk anyway, we don't need to fight anymore now, nor should we fight anymore. In other words, both sides should immediately implement a general ceasefire on all fronts. Only an immediate ceasefire can show both sides' sincerity towards peace. I am honored to be nominated by the organizing committee of this association to serve as the temporary chairman at the opening of this conference. I feel that my virtue is weak and my ability is scarce, and I am ashamed to be up to the task. However, I deeply feel that everyone has a responsibility to promote peace, so I took on the task rashly. Fortunately, this conference will also elect a presidium. I hope that distinguished figures from all over the country and leaders from all walks of life can express their opinions freely at this historic and rare gathering. If this conference can achieve something, it will not only be the good fortune of my colleagues, but also the good fortune of the compatriots across the country and the good fortune of the Chinese nation. The above three points are my personal shallow views, and I can only provide them to you for reference. I also ask for your guidance.

Supervisory Committee Member's Opinion on Peace Talks

Guest Supervisory Committee member Ni Bi said in his speech that the significance of this conference lies in promoting peace, which is the common desire of the people across the country, because without peace, the people cannot survive. I heard that the price of rice has reached 10,000 yuan per stone. In this way, the people must face the threat of war and the pressure of life at the same time. How can they survive? Our Supervisory Committee's opinions on seeking peace are: (1) have the courage to admit defeat; (2) properly negotiate conditions; (3) eliminate obstacles; (4) rectify discipline.

The People of Gansu Advocate Eight Points

Guo Weiping, Deputy Speaker of the Gansu Provincial Council, said in his speech: The northwest is a poor and sparsely populated area with complex ethnic groups and a special environment. Everyone is very concerned. Fortunately, since Mr. Zhang Wenbai arrived, he has been calling for peace, democracy, unity, and solidarity, which has won the support of all parties. Currently, he is protecting the territory and people and striving for comprehensive peace. This is to reassure you all. As for the opinions of the people of Gansu on peace, there are the following eight points, which are provided to you for reference: (1) Peace should be based on equality and mutual understanding. (2) Both sides should implement an immediate ceasefire. (3) Convene a political consultative conference of representatives from all parties, all legal entities, all regions, and social elites across the country. (4) Maintain the legal system of the Republic of China, and the constitution can be amended in accordance with the law. (5) Implement the policy of regulating capital and equalizing land ownership based on the Principle of People's Livelihood. (6) Guarantee the people's freedom of life. (7) The army belongs to the country, and no party may use force as a tool. (8) All peace talks should be carried out under the leadership of the central government as a nationwide unified action.

### Wang Xiaolai Has Two Thoughts and Three Beliefs

Wang Xiaolai of the General Chamber of Commerce delivered a speech: Today, the National Peace Promotion Association is discussing the peace issue that the people of the whole country are most concerned about. Xiaolai has two thoughts and three beliefs. The so-called two thoughts are one of joy and one of fear: (1) What is the joy? Although the conditions for negotiation between the two sides are still quite far apart, the need for peace and the pursuit of peace by the people of the whole country have been recognized by the authorities on both sides. From the standpoint of our people, we sincerely hope that the thirty-eighth year of the Republic of China can become a truly peaceful year. If this is the case, then the two sides will dispel suspicions and make peace, and stop fighting in order to promote martial arts, which will naturally become the democratic and correct track for resolving political disputes in the new political history of modern China, and can also lay the foundation and establish a model from now on. (2) What is the fear? Recently, there have been rumors that the two sides have not made active preparations for the peace talks, and that the deployment of warfare, both offensive and defensive, is still frequent, and even that the Third World War will be triggered by our country. What the heart fears is a cold and shivering feeling. The above two emotions, I believe, are also felt by all of you attending this meeting. The most important topic of today's meeting is how to make what we hope for realized as soon as possible, and to eliminate what we fear as soon as possible. In other words, it is the path for good people to strengthen their belief and efforts in the future of peace. Now, the serious opportunity for the country's peace is flickering, and I deeply hope that the authorities on both sides will have the sincerity of mutual tolerance and concession, embrace the attitude of impartiality and fairness, abandon personal interests, take care of the overall situation, and work together to save the situation. Our basic creed for the future of peace is nothing more than three points: (1) Respecting the inherent morality of the nation, promoting the inherent spirit of the nation, neither being the master nor entering slavery. Integrate the social thoughts of the East and the West, and formulate a thorough reform and progress in politics and economy in a planned and step-by-step manner according to the domestic reality. (2) Maintaining an absolutely detached position, striving to resolve difficulties and disputes, without relying on or being partial to anything. Gathering wisdom and considering the conditions proposed by both sides as the initial basis for peace talks between the two sides, and then agreeing on new reform plans in political, economic, military and other aspects, and determining whether they are feasible based on the will of the whole people, and promoting their realization with the power of the whole people. (3) Recognize the current crisis of the country, which lies in the direction of the people's hearts, and do not delay or be too激. 推诫商权，當機之斷。 Everything should be based on the will of the people, the welfare of the people, and the establishment of a new China that is truly owned, governed, and enjoyed by the people.

### Fellow Provincial, City, and County Associations Recommend Representatives to Appeal for Peace

The fourth joint meeting of the fellow provincial, city, and county associations in Hong Kong passed the following proposals at 2:00 PM yesterday: (1) Recommending ten representatives to appeal for peace, including Wang Xiaolai, He Yaozu, Liang Lieya, Kui Yanfang, Ma Junshuo (the five representatives who have not been recommended will be recommended by the various fellow provincial associations separately, and then reported to the conference in writing for decision). (2) Telegraphing the Kuomintang and the Communist Party again to appeal for peace and stop the war. (3) Requesting the peace representatives to depart on a selected date to the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to appeal for peace.

### More Than 100 Cases of Private Schools Charging Fees Beyond Limits, The Education Bureau Decides to Sort Them Out Within Days and Dispatch Personnel to Investigate and Stop Them Separately

Although the fee standards for private schools at all levels in this city have been approved by Mayor Wu, the schools have not complied with them. They have created various names and charged fees beyond limits in disguised forms, causing parents of students to write to the Education Bureau to report them. As of yesterday, the Education Bureau has received more than 100 letters of complaint. Among them, there are more than 40 schools in the middle school department, including Zhongzheng, Guangxia, Huizhong, Shijie, Nanmo, Qixiu, Xiaoguang, and Aurora, and more than 30 schools in the elementary school department, including Jianhua, Qingbai, Bingsheng, Zhengying, Weiyu, Peiguang, Yuying, Zhengzhong, Luzhi, Jinghai, Zhaofeng, and Ziqiang. Now, the Education Bureau has decided to sort them out within days and dispatch personnel to investigate and stop them separately. Otherwise, the principals of the schools will be replaced in accordance with the method decided by Mayor Wu.

### Rice Prices Soar, Mayor Enraged, If Grain Merchants Fail to Sell Within the Time Limit, They Will Be Punished Severely According to Military Law

The price of rice in Shanghai soared yesterday. The black market price of white rice even approached 10,000 yuan. The rice market formed a stalemate and could not open for trading. After Mayor Wu was informed, he summoned representatives of rice merchants at 5:00 PM to inquire about the situation and inquired in detail about the trading situation of various rice firms. He then learned that the number of people who sold rice based on the government's sales of rice with National Identity Card No. 5 had reached more than 130,000, and the number of people who sold rice based on National Identity Card No. 6 was reported to be less than 2,000, with a total of less than 100 shi, which was far from the original order of 5,000 shi per day for each rice firm. This was obviously a malpractice, so he ordered all the representatives of the rice merchants to be detained. After the representatives of the rice merchants repeatedly requested, he changed the order and ordered each firm to submit a guarantee and temporarily allowed them to go out, and set a deadline of the 16th to submit a clear list of the number of sales in accordance with the original method of selling 5,000 shi per day. If they still refused or made other excuses, they would be sent to the garrison headquarters for strict punishment in accordance with military law for disrupting the people's hearts and destroying the market.

### The Chief of Bao and Teacher Was Sentenced to Three and a Half Years in Prison for Committing Fraud in Rice Allocation

[This newspaper reports] Chuan Weizhong, a teacher at a certain school in Penglai District of this city and chief of the 69th Bao of the district, colluded with Lin Furu, the cadre of the Bao who was at large, and deliberately altered the numbers on the rice certificates of the residents of the Bao, making them unable to receive rice. Since the residents of the Bao could not receive rice, many of them gave up. Chuan and others were able to report less and receive more rice for profit. The Civil Affairs Bureau discovered this and transferred Chuan to the court for trial on charges of corruption. Yesterday, Judge Zhong Xianda of the District Court concluded the trial and pronounced the verdict: Chuan Weizhong took advantage of his position to jointly defraud property, and was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for five years.

### In Order to Prevent the Index of This Period from Being Excessively Disconnected, Another Price Survey Will Be Conducted on the 14th

[This newspaper reports] Prices are rising daily, and the lives of citizens are under serious threat. The salaried class with meager income is especially in a state of panic. The consumer price index for the upper period of this month is also the object of most concern to the public, so "index predictors" have speculated, some saying 250 times, and others saying 300 times. However, it is impossible to find the correct answer before the municipal government's statistics are completed. However, the municipal authorities and the labor circles in this city have indeed discussed several times to find ways to prevent the index from being excessively disconnected from prices. The original plan was to conduct the last price survey for this period's index yesterday. It is now learned that the municipal government has accepted the suggestion of the General Labor Union and decided to conduct another price survey on the 14th. Zhou Xuexiang, the chairman of the Municipal General Labor Union, has also frequently contacted various parties, requesting the capital side to generally issue salaries earlier or borrow a portion to reduce the losses suffered by workers due to the rising tide, and at the same time, requiring the index compilation to be absolutely accurate and reasonable.

### The Shipping Industry Issued a Declaration to the Families of the Victims of the Two Ships

The Shanghai shipping industry believes that after the Jiangya Taiping and other shipping accidents, the actions of the families of the victims demanding compensation and pension fees are inevitably excessive, which affects the business of the two shipping companies. The Shipping Association specially convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors and issued a declaration stating that the families of the victims express their sympathy for the pain of their relatives who died in the disaster and call for salvage and send ships to search. As for the aftermath, it should be handled fairly in accordance with the law and should not be over-manipulated. It must be known that the limit of the shipowner's responsibility for ship accidents is stipulated in my country's Maritime Law.

Impoverished Students Wander Outside the School, Hoping That Enthusiastic Readers from All Walks of Life Will Quickly Offer Sympathy and Assistance

Our newspaper-sponsored "Reader Scholarship Fund" has been raising donations since January 18th, and it will be a month today! The total amount of donations received before and after is less than 100 zu of rice, which is too far from our goal of 500 dan. If we retreat to the second place, the "Reader Scholarship Fund" aims to help 300 students, with each student receiving 1 shi of rice, which will also require 300 shi. Now, schools at all levels have started one after another, and countless impoverished students are still wandering outside the school gates... We believe that in a large city like Shanghai, there must be many enthusiastic readers who can give us the greatest support and assistance within this impatient time, and we deeply hope to donate generously and continuously, so that we can achieve the predetermined goal as soon as possible.

### Issues of Troops Stationed in Various Schools, The Education Bureau Convened a Discussion Meeting and Decided to Negotiate and Resolve the Issues Themselves

[This newspaper reports] Director Li of the Municipal Education Bureau convened a discussion meeting with the principals of various schools stationed by troops yesterday, and more than 30 people attended. During the meeting, Director Li reported on the results of consultations with the Garrison Command, and the principals of various schools also reported on the actual situation. Finally, it was discussed and decided that the schools should still negotiate with the stationed troops themselves to find ways to relocate, merge, or disperse, so as to compress the teaching time and attend classes as usual to maintain students' studies.

In addition, the troops stationed in various schools consume a lot of water and electricity, and the principals said that the slight office expenses of the schools could not afford the cost. Director Li instructed the schools to report to the Education Bureau in writing and forward it to the municipal government, and notify the water and electricity companies to exempt them.

[Another report] The Central National School of the 17th District, No. 103 Shanyin Road, is currently stationed and used by the Shanghai Supply Bureau of the United Logistics Headquarters, so the school cannot attend classes at the original site.

[This newspaper reports] Hualian only defeated Renyu by six points in the basketball league last night, with a score of 43 to 37. The first half was 21 to 15, also a difference of six points.

Zhang Fa, Wei Yuping, Jin Yan, Ling Zhihao, Shi Hui, Han Fei, and others all appeared. The stars' skills were inferior and they were no match for the young students. As a result, the Storm team defeated Youyi, 39 to 17. The first half was 16 to 9. The gymnasium was extremely lively last night, with more than 2,000 people attending.

Hualian and Renyu played carefully, and after each tied three times, Hualian added four points, but soon it became 11 to 9, and the scores were not far apart. Hualian was experienced and tall, but Renyu also had ingenious moves from time to time. The first half was only six points behind, which shows the competitive situation. In the second half, it was also only three or four points apart. When it was 34 to 30, Li Zhenzhong and Renyu's Sun Guozheng were both ejected for committing five fouls. The audience was quite worried about Hualian. The movements of both sides gradually increased due to tension, and there were more fouls. At this time, if Renyu could make a comeback, there might be hope, but both sides were more defensive than offensive. As a result, Hualian narrowly defeated Renyu 43 to 37.

### The Export Promotion Office Discusses Plans to Promote the Export of Gauze

[This newspaper reports] The plan to export gauze, which was previously submitted by the Textile Export Committee to the Executive Yuan, has now been approved by the Executive Yuan. However, the committee will be dissolved soon, and its business will be taken over by the Export Promotion Office of the Import and Export Control Committee. Chen Junren, the director of the office, specially invited Rong Erren and Wang Zijian of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association, Song Lifeng and Zhang Silu of the Textile Construction Company, and Liu Jianhua of the Export Committee yesterday to discuss how to promote the export plan. As a result, a method for the Import and Export Control Committee to manage the export of gauze was drafted, with five key points: (1) The export quota of gauze is based on 30% of the total production of the national gauze factories in 1948. If necessary, it can be increased or decreased with the approval of the competent authority. (2) Regarding the export quota of each factory and the price of gauze for export and cotton, a representative from the Joint Management Office of Cotton Yarn and Cloth, two representatives from the Textile Construction Company, and two representatives from private factories will form an organization to review and approve them. (3) A linkage system will be adopted for gauze export and raw material import. (4) Gauze export is limited to members of the Cotton Textile Association. (5) The foreign exchange earned from gauze export is limited to purchasing machinery, raw materials, dyes, fuels, and other necessary machines and materials needed by various factories.

It is reported that the method is currently being submitted to Liu Weizhi, the Minister of Industry and Commerce and the Chairman of the Import and Export Control Committee, for approval.

Yesterday, the silk market saw a surge in prices due to the sharp rise in the black market price of gold certificates outside the trading circle. A range of commodity prices followed suit. Credit in the market loosened, and turnover within the industry became easier, leading to a surge in new purchases. 120 Heaven Bridge opened at 440,000 yuan.

After red and green tea inventories approached depletion, coupled with the consistent and sudden sharp rise in financial items and commodities in recent days, holders' thoughts became sharper and sharper, and the intention to sell turned even firmer. Therefore, although buyers were pleased, the lack of supply made it difficult to boost transactions. The underlying trend repeatedly showed its strength, and prices reached peaks, which is quite alarming.
