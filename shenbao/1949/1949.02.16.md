### Answering Inquiries Regarding the Prospects for Peace: Acting President Li Expresses Optimism; Supervisory Committee Members Hope the Executive Yuan Will Move Back to Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Acting President Li is extremely optimistic about the prospects for peace. When asked by our newspaper's reporter on the evening of the 15th whether he was confident about the prospects for peace, he smiled and said, "I am confident, I am confident." However, due to time constraints, he did not fully reveal the reasons for his confidence. Acting President Li arrived at the Central Broadcasting Station at 9:00 PM on the 15th to make his first broadcast to the military and civilians of the country since taking office. He met with our newspaper's reporter a few minutes before, and only made a very brief conversation. When asked about his views on the peace issue, Acting President Li said: This matter requires our efforts. Regarding the CCP's repeated delays, Acting President Li did not seem to pay much attention to it, but said: "You can see," expressing his confidence fully when he said this. According to Acting President Li, he has not yet received reports from Yan Huiqing, Shao Lizi, and others who have arrived in Beiping. Acting President Li's broadcast began at exactly 9:00 PM in the afternoon and lasted for eleven minutes. Acting President Li used a slow Guangxi Mandarin to encourage the military and civilians of the country. After finishing his speech, he hurriedly got into the car and returned to his official residence.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Acting President Li hosted a banquet for President Yu of the Supervisory Yuan, Vice President Liu, and all the Supervisory Committee members in Nanjing at the Presidential Palace at 6:00 PM on the evening of the 15th, with more than fifty people attending. At 7:30 PM, he hosted another banquet at his official residence for Commander-in-Chief of the Capital Garrison Zhang Yinming, Mayor of Nanjing Teng Jie, and Leng Xin, among others.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] The Supervisory Committee members in Nanjing decided in the morning session of the Yuan on the 15th to hold a secret discussion meeting in the afternoon to exchange views on the current situation. More than forty Supervisory Committee members attended, still chaired by Yu Youren. The discussion focused on the Executive Yuan's move to Guangzhou and President Sun's personal issues. Regarding the irregularities in the procedures for the Executive Yuan's move to Guangzhou, the Supervisory Yuan has already submitted a censure case, which has not yet been answered. It has now been decided to urge the Executive Yuan to respond again in order to determine the second step. Regarding President Sun's personal matters, the committee members heard many rumors from outside, such as President Sun selling his official residence in the mausoleum and a certain woman selling houses in Shanghai, as well as Sun donating 40,000 US dollars to Zhongshan University in Guangzhou. They all agreed to investigate. If these things are true, the Supervisory Yuan should express its opinion. If they are not true, the Supervisory Yuan can also issue a statement to clarify the rumors, which will also help President Sun's personal reputation. It was then decided to authorize President Yu to appoint committee members to conduct the investigation. The meeting also discussed the location of the Legislative Yuan's meeting and the issue of the Executive Yuan's return to Nanjing. In general, it was hoped that the Executive Yuan could move back, and the committee members decided to make private efforts to promote the Legislative Yuan's resumption of meetings in Nanjing and the Executive Yuan's return to Nanjing.

Widespread Rumors of President Sun's Resignation; He Once Entrusted President Yu with a Letter to Bring to Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] It is widely rumored in the capital on the 15th that President Sun Ke has submitted his resignation to Acting President Li due to high blood pressure. Acting President Li has already sent a telegram to persuade him to stay. Reporters inquired with relevant parties on the evening of the 15th, who said that there was no such thing.

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 15th Dispatch] Executive Yuan President Sun Ke convened a symposium of legislators in Guangzhou at 4:00 PM on the 15th. The content was kept strictly confidential and could not be ascertained.

[United Press, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] President Yu Youren of the Control Yuan said that he returned to Nanjing from Guangzhou, carrying a letter from Executive Yuan President Sun Ke, requesting Acting President Li to allow him to rest due to health reasons.

[United Press International, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Reliable sources said on the 15th that Executive Yuan President Sun Ke submitted his resignation because Acting President Li gained more support in his efforts to seek a political solution with the CCP, making the hope for peace in China, which was torn apart by the war, gradually increase. Some legislators and other government officials believe that Sun's insistence on moving the Executive Yuan to Guangzhou is an "obstacle to peace." Most legislators demanded that the Legislative Yuan reconvene in Nanjing, and the Control Yuan held a monthly meeting in Nanjing today, which was a serious blow to Sun's position. When Li Zongren took office as Acting President, he faced the non-cooperation of extremists, but he has now gradually gained support within the government. General He Yingqin's arrival in Nanjing has given Acting President Li more power to control the army so as not to take actions that may be contrary to his peace policy, especially the National Army in the Nanjing-Shanghai area, because General Tang Enbo is an old subordinate of He.

[United Press International, Hong Kong, 15th Dispatch] According to Guangzhou news, Acting President Li may ask General He Yingqin to succeed as President of the Executive Yuan.

### Rectifying Official Conduct and Military Discipline: Acting President Li Encourages Civilian and Military Officials to Reform Politics and Relieve the People's Suffering

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Acting President Li broadcasted to civilian and military personnel, educators, and frontline soldiers at the Central Broadcasting Station at 9:00 PM on the evening of the 15th. The original text is as follows:

All levels of civil servants and officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force of the country:

Since the day I took charge, considering that the arduous historical task entrusted to me is very important, I feel apprehensive and uneasy at all times. I must do my best to live up to the expectations of the country and the people. For the sake of the country's difficulties and the people's suffering, I have decided that in the shortest possible time, our government must complete two important tasks urgently required by the people of the country: First, to seek peace, and second, to reform politics. Regarding the former, I have explained it in several statements. Today, what I want to talk to you about is the issue of political reform. At the same time, I want to tell you that the government has now decided to work hard in this direction and will overcome all difficulties and eliminate all obstacles to achieve the goal. The issue of political reform, of course, includes a wide range of things, but I believe that the most important and minimal thing at present is to rectify official conduct and military discipline. In other words, we must first start with the psychological and behavioral reform of military and political personnel throughout the country, because without sound workers, there is no way to establish a good political atmosphere. The ancients said, "If one is upright, one can lead without giving orders; if one is not upright, one's orders will not be followed," which is the same principle. Regarding these words, I believe that not only your superiors have already said it to you, but at the same time, I also believe that you must have all felt it together. However, from today onwards, we will not only talk about it, but more importantly, everyone must earnestly practice it.

Now our country is so dilapidated and our people are suffering so unbearably. Not only is national construction impossible, but even the line of hope for national revival after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War has been on the verge of extinction. Not only is it impossible to increase the people's happiness, but even the minimum standard of living cannot be maintained. What is the reason for this? Of course, we do not deny that this is the result of years of war against foreign and domestic enemies, but it is an undeniable fact that we who serve the country and the people have not been able to fulfill our duties. Moreover, even further, there are still a few people who are disturbing the people, exploiting the people, and increasing the people's suffering. I ask everyone, we receive the country's salary and the people's support, but we cannot relieve the people's suffering and increase their welfare. Instead, we have the heart to neglect our duties and seek personal gain. How can we face the country and the people, and how can we face our own conscience? Many people criticize our government for being corrupt and incompetent. I think this is not "groundless accusation" and there is no need to "avoid treatment." We can only frankly admit past mistakes, review past shortcomings, and take out courage and determination to start anew from the bottom up in order to save the country from disaster, relieve the people's suffering, and then build the country and benefit the people.

### The CCP Makes a Simple Report of the News of Yan Huiqing and Others Arriving in Beiping - Without Adding the Title of Peace Representatives to Yan and Others

[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 15th Broadcast: "World News Service" reported: The peace delegation, Yan Huiqing and others, have safely flown from Qingdao to Beiping. The CCP radio station only reported it with very simple words on the 15th, and did not add the title of peace representatives to Yan and others, only saying: "Yan Huiqing, Shao Lizi, Zhang Shizhao, Jiang Yong, Huang Qihan, together with the pilot and others, flew to Beiping at 5:00 PM on the 14th. Yan and others flew from Shanghai to Qingdao on the 13th and transferred to Beiping on the 14th."

### Taiyuan's Grain Problem is Serious; Yan Xishan Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday and Flew to Nanjing in the Afternoon on the Same Plane; He Reported to the Acting President That Evening

[Our Newspaper Report] General Yan Xishan arrived in Shanghai by special plane at 8:00 AM on the 15th. This was Yan's first visit to the city in fifteen years. It was kept strictly confidential beforehand, and very few people knew about it. After arriving, he immediately drove to visit Mr. Lai Puhan, but because Lai was scheduled to leave for the United States on the 16th and was busy with miscellaneous affairs, he did not go to the office, so Yan only met with Griffin, the Deputy Director of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, and Mick Jong Grant, the Special Assistant to the Director of the Commission, to discuss the Taiyuan airlift problem. In the past, Taiyuan was not within the scope of US aid for food supply, and Qingdao is facing a shortage of gasoline, so it will be very difficult to continue airlifting supplies to Taiyuan in the future. All of these were the main topics of Yan's trip to Shanghai for consultations. At noon yesterday, the Shanxi fellow villagers in Shanghai held a public banquet for Yan to express their respect. At 3:30 PM in the afternoon, Yan took the same plane to Nanjing to visit Acting President Li.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Director Yan Xishan of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, due to the serious grain problem in Taiyuan, must personally ask the central government for a solution. He flew from Taiyuan to Qingdao on the 14th, and flew from Shanghai to Nanjing at 5:30 PM on the afternoon of the 15th. The special plane landed at the Ming Palace Airport. Dozens of people, including He Yingqin, Xu Yongchang, Gu Zhutong, Gui Yongqing, Guo Chan, Qin Dechun, and Sun Chu, went to the airport to welcome him. Acting President Li also sent Li Yuqing, the adjutant of the Presidential Palace, to represent him at the airport. After Yan got off the plane, he shook hands with all the welcomers one by one, and briefly exchanged greetings with He Yingqin and Xu Yongchang at the airport. He then drove to the Shanxi Provincial Government Office in Shangcheng'an to talk to Guo Zongfen in Beiping. At 7:30 PM in the evening, He Yingqin, Xu Yongchang, and Gu Zhutong jointly hosted a banquet for General Yan at He's private residence in Douya Gate, and invited Sun Chu and Yang Aiyuan, the Deputy Directors of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters who arrived in Nanjing a day earlier, as well as Gui Yongqing and Guo Chan, to accompany them. At 9:30 PM in the evening, Yan paid respects to Acting President Li to report on the serious grain problem in Taiyuan and the recent military and political situation in the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters area. They talked until 11:00 PM before he left. He then visited Gu Zhutong at 11:00 PM and returned to his residence at 12:00 PM. Yan will stay in Nanjing for two or three days and then return to Taiyuan. Acting President Li is scheduled to host a banquet for Yan at noon on the 16th.

According to people who came with Yan, Yan came this time because the grain problem in Taiyuan is serious, and he specifically asked the central government for a concrete and quick solution. The grain in Taiyuan relies on the central government's airlift. The grain needed has already been stored by the government in Shanghai and Qingdao, but due to the lack of gasoline, the amount of airlift is very limited. Currently, the grain reserves in Taiyuan are only enough for three to five days, and the grain transport planes are in danger of being suspended due to the gasoline problem. Yan had sent Sun Chu to Beijing on the 14th to ask for a solution. After Sun left Taiyuan, news came from the airlift that the grain transport planes flying from Qingdao to Taiyuan might be suspended from the 15th. Yan then temporarily decided to take a grain transport plane to Qingdao, and then flew from Qingdao to Shanghai. On the 15th, he met with Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhang of the Combined Logistics Headquarters, Finance Minister Xu Kan, Griffin, the Deputy Director of the US Economic Cooperation Administration's China Branch, and others to discuss the issue of airlifting grain to Taiyuan and allocating funds to purchase gasoline, and some results have been obtained.

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 15th Dispatch] The airlift to Taiyuan was suspended from the 11th due to the lack of gasoline. The Jin Provincial personnel stationed in Qingdao have been actively negotiating every day, and it is said that they can borrow gasoline from the Qingdao Air Force. It is understood that it may resume on the 16th and 17th.

### Using Silver Dollars is Groundless; Xu Kan Convened a Meeting of Shanghai Financial Leaders Yesterday to Exchange Opinions on New Economic Plans

[Our Newspaper Report] Finance Minister Xu Kan arrived in Shanghai at 2:00 PM on the 14th. On the morning of the 15th, he visited Mr. Lai Puhan, the President of the Central Bank, who is about to leave for the United States, to discuss US aid matters. Xu also convened a meeting of the leaders of the financial community in the city at 11:00 AM in the morning. It is said that Xu's main mission this time is twofold: one is to study and expand the promotion of short-term gold public prices and complete the organization of the Fund Custody Committee; the other is to exchange views with the local financial community on the new economic plan that will be announced soon. Due to Finance Minister Xu's visit to Shanghai, it is widely rumored that the currency system will be reformed again and silver dollars will be used. However, when reporters inquired with the responsible persons of the National Bank's Issuing Bureau, they all said that they had not heard of it. According to their personal opinions, it is currently impossible to issue silver dollars. The so-called saying that the mint had started casting tin dollars a week ago is purely unfounded. In order to enhance the credibility of the currency, the authorities have been constantly selling materials and tightening credit. The flatness of prices in recent days shows the effect of this policy. It will continue to be implemented in the future. Other than this, no other measures have been considered.

### Yan Xishan Discusses the Overall Situation: The Major Plan of Peace and War Depends on the Central Government; Taiyuan Will Not Be the Second Beiping

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] General Yan Xishan met with our newspaper's reporter at the Capital Hotel late at night on the 15th. According to him, he came to Beijing this time to ask the authorities about the food problem in Taiyuan. When he paid respects to Acting President Li on the evening of the 15th, the Acting President said that the Central Committee would do its best to supply it and continue airlifting supplies. The specific methods will be discussed with relevant agencies soon. When asked about his views on local peace and the eight conditions for peace talks proposed by the CCP, General Yan said that the major plan of peace and war depends on the central government, and he will abide by the will of the central government. When the reporter asked if Taiyuan would seek local peace, General Yan said in a firm tone that Taiyuan will never be the second Beiping. I am responsible for defending Taiyuan and will never abandon my responsibility. Yan further used the human body as a metaphor, saying that only the nerve center of a person can determine the activity of the whole body. If the one who issues orders is not the nerve center but one of the limbs, then this is abnormal and should not be the case. Yan bluntly pointed out that local peace is wrong. When the reporter asked about his views on Fu Zuoyi's local peace in Beiping, Yan avoided answering on the grounds that he did not understand the environment in Beiping. When asked if the eight conditions proposed by the CCP could make the peace talks successful, Yan smiled and said: The eight conditions proposed by the CCP are entirely conditions for the victor to deal with the defeated. It is difficult to achieve true peace negotiations from these eight conditions. Finally, Yan also said that everything in the world depends on human effort, and the future of the country is still promising. The President will still return to Beijing to discuss peace talks with Acting President Li. Sun especially said that important members of the Executive Yuan will go to Beijing after the deployment in Guangzhou, but he personally is not suitable to go due to high blood pressure. Next, Tong reported on the process of exchanging views with legislators staying in Guangzhou on the 7th of this month, and finally reported on the living standards in Guangzhou and the deployment of the Legislative Yuan in Guangzhou, saying that no matter where the resumption of meetings is located, whether in Beijing or in Guangzhou, our will must be consistent, we must be united, complete, and unified in order to lead future politics, otherwise it will become a division, and there will be nowhere to go for both peace and war. I hope all colleagues will seriously consider it. Then, the committee members spoke with enthusiasm, and the meeting adjourned at 4:30.

[Our City News] The Legislative Yuan will generally reconvene in Beijing on the 25th or 26th. Legislators from all over the country will begin to register on the 21st. President Tong Guanxian will return to Beijing in a day or two to prepare for the resumption of meetings.

### Report from American Newspaper: A Large Amount of Tungsten Ore is Shipped from China to the United States

[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 10th Broadcast: "World News Service" reported: In recent weeks, a large amount of tungsten iron ore from the newly occupied areas of the CCP has been shipped from Chinese ports to New York. The tungsten iron ore is shipped to the Federal Supply Bureau's Defense Materials Group and will be stored for the needs of important government production. The newspaper continued: According to customs officials, it is hard to remember when such a large amount of this precious ore was imported into New York.

Other cargo ships are on the way, and it is said that they also carry a large amount of tungsten iron ore.

Editorial

### Negotiations on the Sino-Soviet Commercial Treaty and the Xinjiang Issue

Since the central government appointed Burhan as the chairman of Xinjiang Province and sent General Zhang Zhizhong back to the Northwest to negotiate the Sino-Soviet commercial treaty with the Soviet Dihua consul general, the gloomy atmosphere between China and the Soviet Union has gradually cleared. According to a United News Agency dispatch from Guangzhou, negotiations on the Sino-Soviet commercial treaty are still in the exploratory stage. However, according to a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing, preliminary discussions between the Soviet Union and Xinjiang on the establishment of an economic agreement have been completed in Dihua, and have proceeded well. The content has not been disclosed. Reuters estimates that the content involves the Soviet Union's early demands to exploit Xinjiang's mineral resources, including rare metals used in steelmaking. If this estimate is correct, then the content of the Sino-Soviet commercial treaty may be the granting of mining rights in Xinjiang in exchange for certain economic benefits from the Soviet Union, thereby establishing friendly relations between Xinjiang and the Soviet Union, and further developing friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union. Standing on the position of being kind to our neighbors and pursuing peace and friendship with foreign countries, we naturally express our satisfaction with the initial success of the Sino-Soviet commercial treaty negotiations.

China and the Soviet Union are two independent great powers on the continent. Regardless of geographical, historical, or economic relations, China and the Soviet Union should maintain a friendly relationship. The Sino-Soviet border adjacent to Outer Mongolia accounts for half of China's entire border line, starting from the Pamirs in the west, passing through the Altai Mountains, the Mongolian desert, and the Heilongjiang and Ussuri Rivers in the north, and extending to the mouth of the Tumen River in the east. These are all adjacent areas between China and the Soviet Union, and also the areas with the most border disputes. The disputes over the past century have arisen either because the border has not been determined, or because although the border has been determined, the boundary markers are insufficient, or because of different interpretations of treaty wording, or because the Japanese puppets and the Soviets and Mongols have changed the border, which China does not recognize vis-à-vis the Soviets and Mongols. It is not surprising that neighboring countries in an international society easily have border disputes. What is regrettable is that Sino-Soviet-Mongolian border disputes are often an expanded explanation of political disputes, leading to unnecessary conflicts and frictions between the two countries in diplomacy and economics. From a national standpoint, this is extremely unfortunate.

The three districts of Yining, Tacheng, and Ashan in Xinjiang, whose borders were clearly defined in various Sino-Russian treaties, are all included within China's territory, while the outside world is adjacent to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union still recognizes these treaties. In recent years, Sino-Soviet border disputes and internal ethnic separatist movements in Xinjiang have originated in the three districts of Yining, Tacheng, and Ashan, and the occurrence of some unpleasant incidents between Xinjiang and the Soviet Union also stem from this. Uyghur leader Burhan is an enlightened politician. He shares the same views as General Zhang Zhizhong, believing that the crux of the Xinjiang issue lies in peacefully resolving the three districts of Yining, Tacheng, and Ashan, striving for cooperation with the leaders of the three districts for co-evolution, and being friendly to the Soviet Union. The Sino-Soviet commercial treaty case, which had been shelved by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a long time, has been resumed and negotiated, and has gained the friendly support of the Soviet consul general in Dihua. This fully demonstrates that the views of China and the Soviet Union on peacefully resolving the Xinjiang issue, uniting the Xinjiang ethnic groups, are not only the same but also mutually desired. We sincerely hope for the complete success of the Sino-Soviet commercial treaty negotiations, and we also hope that the internal stalemate in Xinjiang will be broken as soon as possible, thereby leading Xinjiang towards a bright future.

Chairman Burhan said well: "Strengthening trade with the Soviet Union and promoting local economic prosperity to solve the livelihood problems of the people of Xinjiang; and how to strengthen unity and realize peaceful unification as soon as possible" is the common responsibility of the military and political leaders of the Northwest and him. General Zhang Zhizhong's swift return to the Northwest this time is aimed at this effort. Secondly, "the only important task is to eliminate the special status of the three districts of Yining, Tacheng, and Ashan." This enlightened politician's observation of the Xinjiang issue is insightful, and his sense of heavy and complex responsibility will become the key to peace in Xinjiang. He will start by opening up this path of peace, transforming Xinjiang into stability and harmony. His efforts to strengthen the Northwest gateway of the motherland are truly admirable!

### Acting President Li's Encouragement and Dismissal of Civil and Military Officials (Continued from page 1)

Indeed, in the past decade or so of war, due to inflation and soaring prices, some civil servants have been living a very hard life, and the soldiers who risked their lives for the country cannot even meet the minimum requirements for food and clothing. Yet, they are still persevering. This spirit of perseverance and fortitude is truly admirable. I should represent the nation in expressing my utmost respect to them. However, on the other hand, many unscrupulous officials have abused their power for personal gain, engaging in corruption and malfeasance, and using all sorts of cunning means to seize the people's wealth for their own benefit, even creating the wealthy and powerful families that the people of the whole country are denouncing today. Yet, they are still living in luxury and extravagance, without any scruples. Furthermore, there are some unscrupulous military officers who disregard the suffering of their subordinates and soldiers, indulging in a life of extravagance and dissipation. Their personal extravagance in a single day exceeds the annual expenses of a soldier. In terms of living conditions, they cannot share the joys and hardships of their soldiers, and in terms of spirit, they are completely detached from their soldiers. In addition, there are many military and political leaders who are arrogant, domineering, enslaving their subordinates, and oppressing the people. As a result, a sense of opposition has formed between superiors and subordinates, between military leaders and soldiers, and between the people and the government. There is certainly no talk of unity and cooperation. As a result, not only have official norms and military discipline been completely destroyed, but also the traditional simplicity and honesty, and the virtues of humility and tolerance of the Chinese nation have been completely ruined. I believe that if this situation is not immediately improved and allowed to continue to develop, the consequences will be unimaginable. I am deeply entrusted by the people and the nation, and I am truly overwhelmed with sorrow, anger, heartache, fear, and anxiety. Therefore, I cannot but point it out, hoping that everyone will be aware of the danger.

Furthermore, I want to tell you again that the government's two decisions to seek peace and reform politics, although the objects are different, the purpose of both is the same. Both are based on the supreme principle of following the will of the people and relieving the suffering of the people. In order to cooperate with the government's supreme principle, our governments at all levels must first and foremost refrain from disturbing or harming the people, and correct and eliminate the bad situations I mentioned earlier. I want to tell all our military and political personnel that everyone must enhance the spirit of serving the country and the people, and must not harbor even the slightest bit of selfishness, self-interest, or arrogance. It must be understood that officials in a democratic country are the servants of the people. If we cannot fulfill our duties and abide by discipline, then we are violating the interests of the country and the people, and we will be rejected by the people and subject to the sanctions of the law. From today onwards, in order to implement political reform, the government is determined to strictly enforce discipline and eliminate all corrupt elements, and will never allow these elements to leave traces in any department of the government. I hope that the supervisory organs at all levels will report the facts as much as possible, the judicial organs at all levels will conduct serious inspections and adjudications, and the people of all localities will file lawsuits in accordance with the law. At the same time, considering the principle of "knowing honor and disgrace after having enough food and clothing," the government will also do its best to improve the treatment of military and political personnel. However, everyone must also understand the difficulties of the government and endure a difficult life, because before the lives of the people are improved, the personnel who serve the people cannot, of course, enjoy better treatment. In short, from now on, I am determined to urge the military and political leaders to rectify official norms and military discipline with the greatest enthusiasm. All our military and political personnel must, under this call, do our best to achieve the spirit of "yesterday's death, today's life." Whether our politics can be reformed, whether our country can be revived, and even the life and death, good fortune and misfortune of the people of the whole country, and the merits, faults, honor and disgrace of each of us, all depend on this turning point today. Today, I repeatedly reiterate this principle here, which is to warn all our military and political personnel not to delay and miss this new opportunity. I not only expect this from you, but I also want to encourage you together (End).

### US Senate Discusses Atlantic Pact, Opposes Being Bound by Participation in War, Especially Vandenberg Insists on This Point

[United Press International, Washington, 14th] Leading figures of both the Democratic and Republican parties expressed in the Senate today their unwillingness to bear the moral obligation to participate in war in the North Atlantic Pact. This treaty, a bulwark for Western countries against a Soviet attack, is currently being negotiated by the US, Canada, France, Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and former chairman Republican Senator Vandenberg, both issued warnings after Republican Senator Donnell raised the issue. Donnell cited a United Press International dispatch, listing the eight points recently raised by Secretary of State Acheson in his talks with Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange, one of which stated that although only Congress can declare war, the US government is willing to acknowledge that an attack on one signatory country is an attack on all. This statement can be interpreted as a willingness to assume a moral obligation to participate in the war. Donnell protested this. Connally said he did not approve of any wording in the treaty that would place America under a moral obligation to fight. Vandenberg said he had explained to the Secretary of State that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee did not approve of including any wording in international agreements that would obligate the United States to participate in the war if European countries were attacked. Any European country could be attacked by another country, not just the one we often hear about. Connally's words clearly referred to the Soviet Union. Vandenberg said, "I hope the alliance will reserve for Congress the full power to decide what action to take in response to an armed attack. Even without any guarantee of military action by the United States, this agreement can be effective. I believe that it is enough to indefinitely guarantee the prevention of a third world war if we only acknowledge America's concern about armed attacks on Atlantic countries, without adding another word to the treaty. I believe that if such a statement of concern had been made earlier, the two world wars would not have occurred."

### Sweden Hopes to Obtain US Aid, Has the Resolution to Abandon Traditional Neutrality, Believes a Nordic Alliance Is Most Suitable for the Current Situation

[United Press International, Stockholm, 14th] Swedish defense authorities declared that Sweden is deeply concerned that a final war between the East and West is inevitable, and therefore intends to participate in the North Atlantic Treaty, but at the same time does not want to anger the Soviet Union. Sweden is willing to coordinate its military equipment with US standards, and is willing for the US to assist with materials to manufacture military equipment and provide large-scale assistance to Denmark and Norway.

Sweden is very willing to plan joint defense matters with Western military experts, hoping that Western countries will immediately send troops to assist when the Scandinavian peninsula is attacked. If the enemy directly attacks Scandinavia, Sweden is capable of resisting for several weeks or months. If the war does not occur in Scandinavia, then Sweden does not intend to immediately participate in the war. However, Sweden's thinking has now greatly changed, and it deeply knows that it is difficult to stay out of the third world war, so it has resolutely decided to abandon its 135 years of neutrality. The previous proposal to sign a joint defense treaty with Denmark and Norway is still intended to be done.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange met with a reporter from the Daily Telegraph today and denied rumors that the opportunity for Norway to join the Atlantic Pact had been reduced after his visit to Washington.

### Wallace is Too Clever, Modifies Truman's Budget

Mainly reduces military expenditures for social undertakings

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] Wallace told the press today that "half of Truman's budget is used to maintain the 'Cold War,' and less than one-seventh is used to eliminate disease, unrest, poverty, and illiteracy." Wallace vehemently criticized Truman's budget and policies at a reception for reporters today, and proposed his own "progressive budget," totaling $54 billion, of which military expenditures would be $6 billion, rather than Truman's $14 billion. Wallace said that Truman's "New Deal" was an illusion, and believed that the door to peace had been opened by Stalin's three proposals for talks in the past two years. He also criticized Truman's attempt to "circumvent" the US domestic economic crisis through large-scale military expansion plans. He also said that the European Recovery Program was part of the "Cold War." In addition, Wallace endorsed the policy of increasing taxes on industrial profits and the President's technical assistance program for underdeveloped areas.

### Pro-Communist Female Journalist Arrested in Soviet Territory on Suspicion of Espionage

[United Press International, London, 15th] TASS reported today, citing a Moscow newspaper, that beautiful journalist Anna Louise Strong has been arrested in the Soviet Union for espionage and will be deported within a few days. There are currently eight US journalists in Moscow, and Strong is one of them. She is 64 years old, originally from Nebraska, and married Moscow native Joel Shubin in 1923. She has authored many pro-Soviet books. She first went to the Soviet Union in 1921 to engage in relief work, and was a correspondent for "Hearst International Magazine" at the time.

In 1930, she founded the English-language "Moscow News" in Moscow, which was discontinued earlier this month. Strong authored the book "Dawn Out of China," published in 1948, which recorded her experiences in the Chinese Communist areas.

US Believes Soviet Move is a Smokescreen

[Our Newspaper News] Washington, 15th Broadcast: US officials said today that the Soviet Union's deportation of pro-Communist journalist Anna Louise Strong may be a smokescreen, because the Soviet Union could more easily obtain her assistance if Ms. Strong remained in the United States. The official also pointed out that Ms. Strong had assisted Wallace in his campaign before her most recent visit to the Soviet Union.

[United Press, Washington, 14th] The Department of the Army announced on the 14th that Secretary of the Army Royal will hold a press conference on the afternoon of the 16th. Officials and the press hope that the conflicting reports on the current US military policy toward Japan can be clarified at that time. Royal's plane is expected to arrive in Washington on the 15th.

[United Press International, San Francisco, 14th] Secretary of the Army Royal, who returned home from inspecting defenses in the Far East, reiterated at a press conference and Democratic Party dinner today that the United States has no plans to withdraw from Japan, and in fact intends to rebuild Japan, so the people of Australia and the Philippines can rest assured. However, Royal also said that it is not known how long the United States will remain in Japan, and this will depend on future circumstances. A reporter asked if the United States attaches importance to Europe and neglects the Pacific side of defense, as was the case during World War II, what is the truth? Royal replied, "I don't know about the 'Europe First' military strategy. I said this because the US military is currently most heavily burdened in Europe." Royal also said that the occupied countries are completing their new goals in Germany and Japan.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Turkish Foreign Minister Sadak discussed the Atlantic Pact, the European Parliament, and the overall situation in Palestine during a meeting at the Foreign Office this afternoon. According to responsible Turkish sources in London, rumors that the Turkish government supports joining the Atlantic Pact should not be given too much credence.

### Train Interrupted Again for Five Hours Yesterday, Employees on Two Lines Request Three Items, Director Wang Agrees to Issue 5,000 Yuan to Each Person First

[Our Newspaper News] Employees of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration, dissatisfied with the new method of individual treatment adjustment announced by the Bureau the day before yesterday, staged a labor strike again yesterday. Trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines were suspended for five hours from 3:00 PM to 8:00 PM.

Employees of the two bureaus have demanded improved treatment and have gone on strike twice on the 8th and 9th of this month.

A labor strike was brewing yesterday morning. At 3:00 PM, the northern electricity suddenly cut off, and all traffic signal lights went out. Staff from all units gathered in the open space on the left side of the Bureau. Union leaders went to persuade them, and the opinions of the masses varied. The three points that can be summarized are: (1) The minimum salary for workers should be equal to the value of three stones of rice. (2) A loan of 20,000 yuan per person. (3) Employee treatment should not be lower than that of the Telecommunications Bureau and the Postal Bureau. He Guanglong, director of the Inspection Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, and Zhang Taixiang, director of the Political Work Department, arrived one after another after hearing the news. Director He also reported the cause of the labor strike to Commander Chen Daqing by telephone. Commander Chen immediately instructed the principles of handling: Treatment issues can be negotiated with the Bureau by representatives, traffic must be restored first, the masses must first disperse, and the martial law must be strictly enforced. Director He announced this opinion to the public, and after further efforts by the union leaders, Director Wang agreed to issue 5,000 yuan to each person starting today, and the calculation of treatment will be based on the Telecommunications Bureau. He also ordered each unit to elect one representative to investigate the method of calculating salaries for the employees of the Telecommunications Bureau together with the Telecommunications Bureau. Director He of the Garrison Department also expressed his determination to crack down on soldiers hitching rides without tickets and anyone smuggling "yellow fish" passengers, in order to increase the Bureau's revenue. Director Wang also stated that any employees of the Tai Road who harbor passengers without tickets or violate regulations will be severely punished.

At that time, Mo Dehui and Zhao Ximeng personally wrote a note, which was taken to the Central Bank to transfer the funds to him for distribution on behalf of the groups.'"

Seeing that the situation was not good, McLain still used the formal lineup from the first half and dared not underestimate the enemy. Before long, they chased again at 30-29. The game became more exciting. McLain eventually beat Ren Yu by one point at 36-35.

In addition to working hard to solicit donations for the "Reader Scholarship," we are also actively conducting school surveys and printing application forms these days.

To simplify the procedure, this year's reader scholarship will continue to use the past method, asking the principals of junior high schools and above (limited to private schools) in this city to distribute application forms and be responsible for the recommendation work. The application forms have been printed and will be completely distributed within three or four days.

What we hope from the school authorities is that they can make earnest and serious recommendations. The highest principles are "poverty and excellence." As for "grades," our standard is "above average," with an average grade in the top third. In recent days, many young people have come to this newspaper to inquire about the application procedures. Here, our answer is to ask them to quickly go to the school they are studying at to register so that they can receive the application form issued by this newspaper at that time.

### Murder on Anyuan Road - Husband Suspects Wife of Adultery - Woman Dies Tragically Under Knife

[Report from our newspaper] A husband killed his wife in a bloody incident at No. 169 Jingshou Lane, Anyuan Road, Shanghai West, at around 2:00 AM yesterday morning. Xu Aizheng, a native of Shaoxing, works at the No. 4 Spinning Mill of the China Textile Company. His wife, Gendi, 24 years old, used to work in the same factory. Because she loved Xu, she married him. The relationship after marriage was considered harmonious. However, recently, Xu suspected his wife of infidelity, and quarrels arose from time to time. Yesterday morning, Xu asked to sleep with his wife, but she refused. Xu became angry and stabbed his wife five times with a small knife. The chest, abdomen, and head were all stabbed severely. Gendi shouted desperately. Seeing that he had caused trouble, Xu was about to go downstairs to escape when the neighbors downstairs heard the alarm and rushed over. Seeing the bloodstains, they knew that something major had happened, so they grabbed him. At the same time, they urgently reported to the Putuo Road Police Station. Section Chief Zhu Dingkun led police officers to the scene, arrested the murderer and took him to the police station. They sent the injured to the Southeast Hospital, but because the injuries were so severe, she died before she could be treated. The bureau transferred Xu to the District Prosecutor's Office for trial on charges of murder.

### Many Bank Clients Have Checks Bounce; Financial Management Bureau Intensifies Inspections

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Financial Management Bureau is paying close attention to the situation of bounced checks from bank clients. It has dispatched a large number of auditors to various banks to investigate the reasons for the bounced checks.

According to the Financial Management Bureau, there are two reasons for the increase in bounced checks: (1) Clients have overdrawn beyond their overdraft limit, resulting in insufficient funds; (2) Banks are facing a tight financial situation themselves, and are temporarily unable to turn funds around. Regardless of the reason, bounced checks are an undesirable phenomenon. In order to determine responsibility, the Bureau has decided to send personnel to various banks to inspect the accounts of general clients and the business situation of the banks themselves. If any illegal business operations are discovered, penalties will be imposed.

### Foreign Exchange Certificates Fall Back

Yesterday morning, the opening price of foreign exchange transfer certificates reflected a strong desire to sell short, hovering around 1,250 yuan. Subsequently, due to a sudden and sharp tightening of interbank lending, importers and exporters rushed to unload their holdings, and the market price fell back to 1,200 yuan. In the afternoon, the Central Bank intervened and purchased 200,000 US dollars, improving market conditions. The afternoon closing price for commercial designated banks was 1,240 yuan for buying and 1,280 yuan for selling, a decrease of 20 yuan compared to yesterday.

### Influx of Idle Funds from South China; Credit Conditions Ease from Tight

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday morning, due to unusually tight credit conditions, with the daily interest rate reaching as high as 20 yuan per 1,000 yuan, market prices generally declined. However, credit conditions eased in the afternoon, and commodity prices rose sharply. According to analysis by senior officials of the National Bank, the easing of credit conditions was mainly due to the influx of idle funds from South China. Currently, commodity prices in Guangdong are much higher than in Shanghai, leading to a reverse flow of funds.

Previously, the exchange rate from Guangzhou to Shanghai was 750 yuan to 1,000 yuan. The day before yesterday, it had increased to 1,000 yuan to 1,000 yuan, and yesterday it further increased to 1,100 yuan to 1,000 yuan. Due to the influx of idle funds, the daily interest rate has returned to 80 yuan per 1,000 yuan. It is predicted that there will be no major changes in market conditions today.

The sale of this silk is entrusted by the China Trust Bureau to the China Silk Corporation. As of the 14th, the China Trust Bureau had sold 735 bundles. The market has already absorbed a large quantity, and there were no buyers at the close of the market. There were also no purchases yesterday. As a result, silk prices fell back and stabilized. Over 600 million Gold Yuan were recovered. The Bureau will continue to sell the silk depending on market conditions.

### Sugar Prices Inexorably Decline

Yesterday's sugar market was affected by tight credit conditions and high daily interest rates of up to 100 yuan per 1,000 yuan, resulting in a flat and weak trend. Although there was a rebound in the afternoon, general prices remained low. For example, "four and a half" sugar was 17,500 yuan, "three and a half" sugar was 15,500 yuan, and coarse sugar was 17,500 yuan. Various grades of refined white and red sugar all experienced slight declines of 200 to 500 yuan. However, the prices of Zhen Ji's sliced crystal sugar, clear ice sugar, and green sugar remained the same as yesterday's market, as sellers were unwilling to lower prices.

### Decline in Silk Fabrics Not Yet Halted

The opening trend for superior grade raw silk yesterday morning was flat and weak. Later, the selling pressure intensified due to tight credit conditions, and prices continued to decline.

Arbitrage increased to 9 jiao to 1 yuan.

Silk fabrics: The opening price for Huaqiang coverlets was 247,000 yuan, rising to 253,000 yuan at one point and falling to 246,000 yuan at the lowest. The afternoon closing price rebounded slightly to 250,000 yuan. The opening price for rayon coverlets was 170,000 yuan, and the afternoon closing price rose to 172,000 yuan.

### Tea Market Transactions Sparse

Yesterday's tea market conditions were such that, due to dwindling inventories and constantly increasing costs, sellers were determined to hold out for higher prices, and the trend continued to be upward. However, transactions were sparse due to unsuccessful negotiations. It is understood that since the Lunar New Year, the Suzhou and Wuxi areas have been considering adding additional taxes to various varieties, but under the aforementioned circumstances, it is impossible to proceed.

### Tung Oil Prices Hover

Yesterday's tung oil market, after opening, experienced a sudden halt to rising prices due to tight positions among industry players and high interbank interest rates. The underlying trend gradually showed signs of instability. However, when this month's preliminary index was released, showing an increase of slightly less than four times compared to the previous period, sellers regained confidence due to the sharp increase in expenses, and the willingness to sell turned slightly firmer. The trend quickly turned upward, and the final result was that prices remained unchanged.

### Cotton Yarn Prices Mixed; Tight Credit Conditions Hamper Efforts to Boost Fabric Market

Yesterday, cotton yarn prices fluctuated. The opening reflected the weakness from the previous day, and buying interest was lackluster. During the day, various groups saw no buying or selling, and only a few individual investors made slight upward adjustments. Near noon, it was heard that the cost of living index had increased significantly compared to the previous period, and there were rumors of currency reform. As a result, confidence was restored and the weak situation was reversed. In the end, the prices of various yarns rose and fell differently.

42-count Blue Phoenix yarn opened low at 470,000 yuan, was once pushed up to 510,000 yuan, and finally fell back to 490,000 yuan, a slight decrease of 5,000 yuan from the previous day. 32-count Silver Moon yarn finally rose by 25,000 yuan, closing at 185,000 yuan.

Various fabrics were unable to rally and ultimately closed lower. The leading fine cloth chips were even tighter, and there were still no transactions in the market. As for off-market quotes, they were generally similar to the previous day, with prices around 12,000 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors of speculative buying were strong, and it was said that some people were still buying at 13,000 yuan.

### Market Restores Free Trading; Rice Prices Decline Slightly; Flour and Edible Oil Both Fall Then Rise

The rice market yesterday lifted price controls, and free trading was restored in both the North and South markets. Covert transactions were transformed into open transactions. Due to tight credit conditions, the market was weak and prices were slightly lower than the previous day's black market prices by 100 to 200 yuan. In the South market, Bai Jing and Bo Cheng rice were both trading at 8,400 yuan. Although they strengthened slightly during the day, they weakened at the close, ultimately falling by 100 yuan. Early rice fell by a small amount of 200 yuan, high-quality goods were 8,000 yuan, and medium-grade and substandard goods retreated within the 8,000 yuan mark. Transactions in Bai Yuan and Yin Yuan were rare. In the North market, Bai Jing rice was 8,300 yuan, and Gao Zao Cheng rice fell to 8,000 yuan. Arrivals were 1,754 shi in the South market and 8,622 shi in the North market.

Edible Oil: The market trend was first down and then up. At the opening, the market was bearish due to extremely tight credit conditions and high interbank interest rates. At the opening, rapeseed oil was 31,500 yuan and soybean oil was 38,000 yuan. Later, due to the release of a very high cost of living index and strong reports of outside commodity prices, retail investors bought at low prices, and prices rose steadily. The highest price for rapeseed oil was 39,000 yuan, and the closing price was 38,000 yuan, an increase of 4,000 yuan. The closing price for soybean oil was 44,000 yuan, an increase of 5,000 yuan. Cooked rapeseed oil and other varieties all fell first and then rose. The closing price for soybean cake rose sharply by 300 to 400 yuan.

Flour: First down and then back up. At the beginning of the market, credit conditions were even tighter and interest rates were high. Rice prices fell, and sentiment became even weaker. Bingchuan opened lower by 220 yuan, trading at 3,500 yuan. In the middle of the market, buyers were eager to move, and sentiment was unanimously bullish. The closing price rebounded to 3,620 yuan. After the closing price, buyers were eager to purchase, and sellers took the opportunity to raise prices. Market conditions continued to improve, and the closing price was 3,750 yuan. There were not many transactions in Lao Che flour, which opened at 3,850 yuan. Bran opened down 200 yuan, and rebounded by 20 yuan at the close. The closing price for Fuxin Large Package was 2,680 yuan.

Corn and red sorghum rose slightly by 200 yuan. Selected green grains were slightly lower.

### Commercial Briefs

Yesterday's timber market, although affected by the daily rise in other commodity prices, experienced only a slow increase in timber prices, lagging far behind other daily necessities. The spot price for fir was 45 yuan per foot, and the price for foreign pine was 150 yuan per foot.

Taishi Taihe Hing Bank recently launched a small-amount current account deposit service to develop its business. An account can be opened with a minimum deposit of 3,000 yuan, and a beautiful leather wallet is given as a gift.

Since the Lunar New Year, the rate of increase in hardware store prices has been quite significant, but because factory production has not returned to normal, actual sales are still rare. Apart from rebar, which is still in high demand for military use, there are few large-scale transactions. Only galvanized iron, lead sheet, and wire nails are experiencing brisk trade, with frequent buying and selling, making them more active than other items in the hardware category.

It is reported that in recent months, the single-person hardware trade from Hong Kong to Shanghai has disappeared. The reason is that hardware prices in Shanghai are sluggish, and prices in Hong Kong are higher than in Shanghai, making it unprofitable to transport goods. However, some materials, such as galvanized iron, are said to be flowing back to Hong Kong.

The cigarette and soap market was initially tight due to extremely tight interbank lending rates, which rose to 120 yuan. However, due to Yong Tai He raising its price, the market became firm. Later, after the cost of living index was released, it was necessary to pay a premium on top of the market price to purchase goods at the close of the market.
