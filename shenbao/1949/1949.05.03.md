### The Emergency Committee of Military Academy Alumni Issues a Letter to All Military Academy Alumni

[Central News Agency, this newspaper dispatch] The "Emergency Committee" established by alumni of central military schools held a meeting yesterday (May 2nd). It conducted specific discussions on important committee affairs and action guidelines, and passed and issued a "Letter to All Military Academy Alumni." The full text is excerpted below:

Revolutionary comrades:

What day is this? The great and arduous national revolutionary cause has been constantly attacked and undermined by the Chinese Communist bandit party, and it has reached an extremely serious juncture. The fruits of victory, won with countless sacrifices of blood, are being sacrificed under the expansionist politics and aggressive policies of the Communist International. It incites the Chinese Communist bandit party's violent group to extinguish humanity, betray the motherland, trample on human rights, and ruin the nation and people. It has brought the 5,000 years of cultural history to the brink of destruction, and has plunged the nation, the people, and the masses into a dangerous and dark period. The crimes of the Communist bandit party in China over the past 20 years, including uprisings, struggles, murder, and arson, are well known and need not be listed. Just look at how the Chinese Communist Party helped the Red imperialists dismantle various industrial and mining equipment in the Northeast that had been squeezed out of the Chinese people over the past 50 years, with a value of over 2 billion US dollars, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Recently, the bandit leader Mao Zedong, in order to show loyalty to his foreign masters, shouted for peace and opposed the Atlantic Pact, openly declaring that once the Third World War breaks out, he will fight side by side with the Soviet Union. All of the above facts fully demonstrate that the Chinese bandit party is willing to be the fifth column of the Red imperialists, to massacre our compatriots, destroy our national roots, undermine the spirit of national independence and autonomy, and rob our people of their freedom and rights. It does not hesitate to lock the entire territory of China behind the Iron Curtain, turning it into the battlefield of the Third World War, and does not hesitate to turn all the peace-loving and good people of China into cannon fodder for the Communist International. His vicious heart and insidious methods can be said to be unprecedented and unparalleled.

Ironclad facts prove the hideous true face of the Chinese Communist bandit party violent group:

(1) Taking affiliation with the Iron Curtain as liberation, arbitrarily selling out the nation's territorial sovereignty, fully demonstrating its anti-nationalist behavior;

(2) Taking coercion and enslavement as emancipation, arbitrarily destroying the people's freedom and rights, fully demonstrating its anti-civil rights behavior;

(3) Taking looting and encroachment as liquidation, arbitrarily destroying the people's lives and property, fully demonstrating its anti-people's livelihood behavior.

However, Mao Zedong, the chieftain of this violent group, based on his psychology of "becoming a king if successful, a bandit if defeated" and the old trick of "hooligan ruffians as vanguards of the revolution," as well as the method of coercing peasants to launch armed riots, worked as an accomplice for the Red imperialists. In backward China, he openly raised his head and wantonly set up his so-called "new democratic anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-bureaucratic capital behavior" as a talisman for his false and deceptive propaganda, hoping to use this to cover up his crimes of harming the country, selling out the nation, and oppressing the people. If this arch-villain is not eliminated, the instruction that "the nation will perish and the race will be destroyed in short order" will come true. Treading on the blood of the martyrs, following in the footsteps of patriots and people of goodwill across the country, we will fight together with our compatriots and fellow soldiers to realize the lofty ideals of the Three Principles of the People: government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Over the past 20 years, our alumni and comrades have fallen one after another, achieving righteousness and rushing to death, writing a glorious and moving history with their blood. The accumulated achievements have created new opportunities for national unity, independence, democracy, and progress. However, because of the Communist International Red imperialists, who are more ferocious than the Japanese aggressors, using the situation of poverty and turmoil after the world war to implement a conspiracy of expansion and aggression, and inciting and funding the Chinese Communist bandit party to undermine the country's opportunities for independence, unity, democracy, and progress, in order to achieve their ambition of communizing China and communizing Asia, internally, there is a group of dregs who lack faith in revolutionary doctrines, are corrupt and backward, opportunistic, and afraid of death, who do not know how to cherish this hard-won opportunity for national independence, unity, democracy, and progress, or who corrode the revolutionary ranks, or who echo the bandit party. As such, the Communist bandit party violent group was able to take advantage of opportunities to act arrogantly and violently, causing the revolutionary cause to suffer unprecedented setbacks.

After a close examination of the domestic and international situation, it can be clearly seen that the result of the evil deeds of the Chinese Communist bandit party violent group, driven by the Communist International Red imperialists, can only give the Chinese people war, not peace; can only give the Chinese people totalitarian enslavement, not the rights of freedom; can only give the Chinese people destruction, not construction. That is to say, the Chinese Communist Party can only bring chaos to the Chinese people, not peace; can only bring autocracy to the Chinese people, not democracy; can only bring poverty to the Chinese people, not food and clothing. All the reckless actions of the Communist bandit party violent group, which extinguish humanity, naturally run completely counter to all the just and reasonable needs of life. The result of this will inevitably lead the nation and the people into an irrecoverable abyss!

Furthermore, from the perspective of the current stage of the revolution, it is very clear that China today only has two paths to take: one path is to allow the Communist bandit party violent group to sell out the nation's territorial sovereignty, destroy the people's freedom and rights, and infringe upon the people's lives and property, causing the nation and the people to be trapped in a state of being vassals, enslaved, and plundered for a long time; the other path is for the revolutionary soldiers of the Three Principles of the People and the people throughout the country to resolutely engage in the struggle against aggression, against totalitarianism, and against plunder in order to defend the nation's territorial sovereignty, safeguard the people's freedom and rights, and protect the people's lives and property, so that the nation's independent survival and the people's free life can be ensured. At the same time, naturally, there are only two paths to take: one path is to face the situation of failure, be pessimistic and disappointed, lose heart, be cowardly and timid, live in ease and苟安, willingly abandon lofty revolutionary ideals and glorious revolutionary history, abandon the arduous and outstanding revolutionary leaders, disregard the military's duty to serve the country and the people, and even shamelessly surrender to the enemy, handing over their fate to the enemy to control, allowing the Communist bandit party to trap the nation and the people in a state of being vassals, enslaved, and plundered for a long time; the other path is to face the lessons of failure, conduct strict reviews, make practical corrections, be tenacious and unyielding, move forward bravely, become more courageous after each setback, and reaffirm that the revolutionary war against aggression, against totalitarianism, and against plunder will inevitably achieve final victory. Under any difficult circumstances, we must maintain the character of revolutionary soldiers, and with an iron will and a fearless spirit, fight to the end with the Communist bandit party violent group in order to win the nation's independent survival and the people's free life. It is very clear that the latter path leads to glory and victory.

Comrades, at this most critical moment, we can no longer hesitate or waver. Bravely and resolutely stand under the revolutionary banner of the Three Principles of the People, and forever unite closely with the millions of comrades who share life and death and share weal and woe, and fight for anti-aggression, anti-totalitarianism, and anti-plunder. The final victory will surely belong to us.

Undoubtedly, to embark on the path of glory and victory, we must examine the shortcomings of the past, raise revolutionary vigilance, and reorganize the revolutionary ranks. We believe that everyone, even every revolutionary soldier, has some shortcomings. We must first use strict organization, self-criticism at any time, self-examination, and thorough reflection, muster the greatest courage to admit mistakes, and muster the greatest determination to correct mistakes. We must be able to defeat ourselves before we can defeat the enemy.

Today, we need to examine the thoughts, lives, behaviors, and styles of revolutionary soldiers themselves, not allowing corruption or falling behind. In particular, we need to examine the spirit, atmosphere, and discipline of the revolutionary ranks, not allowing them to be scattered, demoralized, or even corrupted. Let the elements that have become corrupt, fallen behind, and cannot be saved be eliminated from the revolutionary ranks. Let the opportunistic elements who fear death be buried alive by the Communist bandit party in front of defeatism. As long as we share weal and woe and share safety and danger with the soldiers, plan together in action, rescue each other in times of danger, do not compete for credit in victory, and do not shirk responsibility in defeat, as long as we can love the people, protect the people, not startle them when stationed, and not disturb them when marching, the morale of the entire army can surely be raised, and the hearts of the people throughout the country can surely be uplifted. The shame of past failures can surely be washed away. At the same time, retired alumni in their hometowns should also recognize the current serious situation, conduct practical reviews, not be pessimistic or disappointed, not blame heaven and earth, and not see no way out. As long as we have a breath left, our will will not slacken. We will shoulder the responsibilities that revolutionary soldiers of the Three Principles of the People should bear and wage a resolute and desperate struggle against the Communist bandit party that is undermining our military reorganization and recovery plan. As long as we are willing to do our best to organize and train the people, engage in self-defense, mobilize manpower and material resources, and support the front lines, the glorious revolutionary history that we have won in past charges will never be destroyed by the jumping clown Communist bandit party.

Revolutionary comrades! Everyone must raise revolutionary vigilance, thoroughly recognize the unreasonable demands of the Communist bandit party, which have recklessly put forward eight articles and twenty-four clauses in the form of a surrender document, and have brazenly rejected the people's and the government's desire for peace. The bandit leader Mao Zedong has also ordered a general offensive, frantically crossing the Yangtze River, and even vainly claimed to "thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate the National Revolutionary Army." We must thoroughly understand the hidden enemies who are lurking in our ranks, shaking our will, corroding our strength, and all the pessimistic, disappointed, compromising, and surrendering enemies, both overt and covert. We must thoroughly understand our own shortcomings, the corrupt and degenerate lifestyles, the perfunctory working methods, and the unsupportive fighting methods. We must thoroughly change and correct all of these. Recognize the source of the disease, aim at these obstacles to the revolution, and concentrate unparalleled strength to carry out a major sweep.

Secondly, we believe that the past military failures were caused by the inherent shortcomings of the military itself, but the failure factors caused by the unhealthy and unimproved influence of the party and government were even more numerous than the shortcomings of the military itself, and cannot be fully described in a short space. We all have a common grand aspiration today: to pledge our sincerity and enthusiasm to assist in the transformation of the party, to implement all the past political orders that could not be implemented, to ensure that policies that meet the greatest interests of the greatest number of people are effectively promoted and implemented, to ensure that the masses we lead can truly live organized lives, to strive for close cooperation between the party and the government, and to strive to make political facilities a true manifestation of the party's policies. We must target this need, follow this goal, move forward bravely, and promote its realization and success.

Based on the above understanding, we feel that all our revolutionary comrades, whether in active service or reserve service, in the hometown where the military is rising, there is a need to reorganize and unite anew. To restore the organization of the Whampoa Revolution and carry forward the spirit of the Whampoa Revolution to strengthen the strength of the revolutionary struggle is our only responsibility today. It is also our solemn and decisive answer to the Communist Party's threat to "thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate the National Army." Revolutionary comrades! We, the alumni from various places who have come to Shanghai, with infinite grief, look remotely at the tomb of the Father of the Nation, and silently mourn our compatriots who have been subjected to the ravages of war. Today, when the bandit leader Mao Zedong has undermined peace, ordered a general offensive, frantically crossed the Yangtze River, and pressed on Shanghai, the organization of the Emergency Committee of the Central Military Academy Alumni Association has been formally established in Shanghai to unite all revolutionary alumni and continue to fight to the end to eliminate the counter-revolutionary Communist bandit party violent group. We will never abandon the spirit of Premier's peace and struggle to save China, and we vow to be sincere and sincere to do our best to meet the new challenges of the Communist bandit party violent group, and to crush the conspiracy of the Communist International Red imperialists to communize China and communize Asia.

Revolutionary comrades! Organize, unite, thoroughly eliminate the opportunistic and pessimistic defeatists, and at the same time thoroughly eliminate the ultimate enemy of the revolution, the Communist bandit party violent group. Loyalty and treachery are exceptionally clear. Aggression and totalitarianism will inevitably fail, and truth and justice will inevitably triumph. This is very clear. Finally, we unanimously shout: Carry forward the spirit of Whampoa! Eliminate the traitorous bandits! Complete the later revolution! Build the Republic of China! Long live the Three Principles of the People! Long live the Chinese nation!

### The Air Force Can Hinder the Communist Advance

Chennault Attempts to Revive the Flying Tigers

[United Press, Hong Kong, 2nd dispatch] General Chennault of the Flying Tigers has now returned to the United States. He will soon present his opinions on aid to China to Congress and attempt to revive the Flying Tigers to assist the Chinese government in its operations. Before returning to the United States, he told business people in Guangzhou that he believes that the Chinese government still has hope if it receives appropriate assistance. An air force that is specially trained to carry out bombing and ground strafing can stop the communist advance and allow the government forces to reorganize at their leisure and organize new defenses in South China. Chen suggested that if the government retains its bases in the Northwest and Southwest, such as Lanzhou and Chongqing, his Flying Tigers, once revived, can effectively deal with the communist forces.

### Warplanes Concentrated in Shanghai; Continuous Daily Strikes; Fruitful Results

### Commissioner Yu's Office Monthly Meeting; Zhang Qun Reviews the Situation; States Determination to Strive for Stability in the Southwest; Emphasizes the Spirit of Political Innovation

[This newspaper, Chongqing, 2nd dispatch] Zhang Qun presided over the first monthly meeting of the Commissioner's Office on the 2nd since taking office. He reported that the Communist Party's eight articles and twenty-four clauses are not only conditions for crossing the Yangtze River, but also for establishing military control institutions throughout the country. The Minjiang and Tuojiang Rivers in Sichuan Province, the Pearl River in Guangdong Province, the Lancangjiang River in Yunnan Province, the Tanshui River in Taiwan Province, and Keelung and Kaohsiung in Taiwan Province will all not be spared. Therefore, the current war for justice and the War of Resistance Against Japan are not essentially different. Both are wars against aggression. If we do not fight desperately now, the Communist Party will take our lives. However, in reviewing the situation, we should reflect on and liquidate ourselves. Everyone must acknowledge responsibility for the failures of the past. During the peace talks, there was much debate about preparing for war while seeking peace and seeking peace through war. Now that the Communist Party has revealed its true face, he will absolutely follow the national policy decision made by President Chiang, Acting President Li, and Premier He at the meeting in Hangzhou on April 22 and strive to stabilize the Southwest. He also emphasized the spirit of political innovation, stressing the three points of simplicity, speed, and certainty, hoping to strengthen the forces of unity, self-defense, and self-sufficiency. He also said that US President Roosevelt once said, "When we know what environment we are in, we know what to do." Finally, he ordered the cancellation of Sunday holidays.

[Report from Our Newspaper] It is reported that the naval Yangtze River Defense Fleet, which guards the capital and defends the Yangtze River, with the exception of the Yongjia and four other warships that quickly passed through the Jiangyin artillery blockade on the night of April 24th and were immediately diverted to the Nanjing and Caishi areas of the river, anchoring along the shore, ultimately could not escape the search of the Air Force. Since the end of April, the Air Force dispatched bomber squadrons to bomb them. It is reported that as of May 2nd, six of the eight warships have been destroyed, and the remaining two have also been damaged. It is expected that they can all be annihilated within days.

Revolutionary students and comrades! Everyone must heighten their revolutionary vigilance and thoroughly recognize the communist bandits' brazenly putting forward eight articles and twenty-four clauses, which resemble a letter of surrender with unreasonable demands, and stubbornly rejecting the people's and the government's desire for peace. We must completely recognize the sinister attempt of the bandit chieftain Mao Zedong, who has ordered a general offensive and frantically crossed the Yangtze River, and even presumptuously claimed to "thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate the National Revolutionary Army." We must thoroughly understand the internal enemies, whether overt or covert, lurking in our camp who shake our will, corrode our strength, and those who are pessimistic, disappointed, and compromise and surrender. We must thoroughly change and correct our own shortcomings, such as a corrupt and degenerate lifestyle, a perfunctory work style, and a combat style that does not offer mutual support. Identify the source of the disease, aim at these obstacles to the revolution, and concentrate unparalleled strong forces to sweep them away on a large scale.

Secondly, we believe that the military failures of the past were due to the shortcomings of the military itself, but the failure factors caused by the unhealthy and unprogressive influence of the party and government are more numerous than the shortcomings of the military itself, and cannot be fully described in a short space. Today, we all have a common ambition to assist in the transformation of the party with sincerity and enthusiasm, eliminate corrupt elements in the party, maintain the authority of the party's leadership, tighten the party's organization, and rectify the party's discipline. We also pledge to support the government with sincerity and enthusiasm, implement political reforms, and implement all the political orders that could not be implemented in the past, so that policies that conform to the greatest interests of the vast majority of the people can be effectively promoted and implemented, ensuring that the masses we lead can truly live an organized life. Strive for close cooperation between the party and the government, and strive to make political facilities a true expression of the party's policies. We must aim at this need, follow this goal, and move forward courageously, hoping for realization and success.

Based on the above understanding, we feel that all of our revolutionary students and comrades, whether active or reserve, in the military or in the countryside, really have the necessity to reorganize and reunite. Restoring the organization of the Whampoa Revolution and promoting the spirit of the Whampoa Revolution to strengthen the revolutionary combat power is our only responsibility today, and it is also a clear and decisive answer to the brazen statement of the Communist Party that they want to "thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate the National Army." Revolutionary students and comrades! Today, our classmates from all over the country have come to Shanghai. With infinite sorrow, we look to the mausoleum of the Founding Father of the Nation and silently remember our compatriots who have suffered from the ravages of war. Today, when the bandit leader Mao Zedong has destroyed peace, ordered a general offensive, frantically crossed the Yangtze River, and is pressing Shanghai, we have officially established the Extraordinary Committee of the Alumni Association of the Central Military Academies in Shanghai. We are determined to use the organization of the Extraordinary Committee of the Alumni Association to unite all revolutionary students and mobilize all revolutionary students to continue to fight to the end to eliminate the counter-revolutionary communist bandit violent group. We uphold the spirit of Premier Sun's peaceful struggle to save China, and pledge our utmost sincerity to meet the new challenges of the communist bandit violent group and to shatter the conspiracy of the Communist International and Red Imperialism to communize China and communize Asia.

Revolutionary students and comrades! Organize, unite, and completely eliminate the opportunistic, pessimistic defeatists. At the same time, completely eliminate the ultimate enemy of the revolution, the Communist bandit violent group. Loyalty and treachery, obedience and rebellion are exceptionally clear. Aggression and totalitarianism will inevitably fail, and truth and justice will inevitably triumph. This is very clear. Finally, we unanimously shout: Promote the spirit of Whampoa! Eliminate the traitorous bandits! Complete the later revolution! Build the Republic of China! Long live the Three Principles of the People! Long live the Chinese nation!

### Li Lisan Calls on Workers to Oppose American Imperialism: Anti-British and American Parade on May Day in Beiping

[United Press, San Francisco, 2nd] The Beiping Communist Radio Station broadcast on the 1st the Labor Day speech of Li Lisan, "Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Labor," calling on Chinese workers to oppose the "aggressive forces led by American imperialism." The radio station only reported Li's speech and did not broadcast the full text of the speech. The radio station had broadcast the full text of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China praising the capture of Nanjing and Taiyuan, but the statement only mentioned imperialism once and did not mention the United States at all. This possible moderation of anti-American propaganda came one day after a spokesman for the Chinese Communist Party issued a statement yesterday stating that the Chinese Communist Party would consider establishing diplomatic relations with various countries under certain conditions.

In his speech, Li advised workers on the following four points: First, assist the Communist army in completing the revolution; second, quickly restore and develop production; third, establish and consolidate trade unions throughout the country; fourth, for the sake of China's independence, freedom, and peace, workers must stand side by side with the world's peaceful democratic forces and oppose the aggressive forces led by American imperialism.

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 1st] The Beiping Radio Station broadcasted that a May Day parade was held in Beiping on the 1st. The marchers carried huge books with the words "Enemy of the People" written on them. The picture painted on the books was of "Uncle Sam," "Japanese warlords," and a jackal representing Britain, walking hand in hand, pulling several handcarts with the names of ships such as "Amethyst" written on them.

According to a spokesman for the Association, after the Portuguese nationals in Shanghai held a meeting on Sunday to discuss evacuation matters, more than 300 people had registered with the Association expressing their willingness to evacuate. However, due to the fact that various exit procedures require a considerable amount of time, the first evacuation ship, the Dutch ship "Chidatan," will not be able to evacuate all the registered Portuguese nationals when it sets sail from Shanghai on May 6th. A spokesman for the Portuguese Association also said that after the "Chidatan," the Portuguese merchant ship "Huazhong" (transliteration) may be chartered to evacuate Portuguese nationals from Shanghai.

### Editorial: India's New Status

The British government will issue a public announcement on the 27th of last month, after the conclusion of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference held in London, stating: "The Indian government has notified the Commonwealth governments that the people of the whole country hope that India will become an independent and autonomous republic under the new constitution that is about to be implemented, but they are still willing to continue to be a member of the Commonwealth; and are willing to accept the British King as the head of the Commonwealth." From then on, the legal status of India can be completely determined. India no longer has a governor appointed by the British government, and no longer has the Privy Council of the United Kingdom as its highest judicial organ, but will be an independent and autonomous republic, only nominally recognizing the King as its head. The establishment of India's new status must be said to be the result of the efforts of Indian Prime Minister Nehru. The National Congress Party expressed satisfaction with the successful conclusion of this conference, and especially expressed a warm welcome to India's acquisition of a new legal status. The rational adjustment of British-Indian relations is an important factor for stability in Asia. Standing in the position of a neighboring country, we should express infinite joy for our neighboring country to become an independent and autonomous republic.

The theme of this conference, the motive of the British government in convening this conference, was to determine whether India's legal status was still within the scope of the British Commonwealth. Therefore, on the eve of the opening of this Commonwealth conference, the Indian people were very concerned about the fate of their own country, and the British government and the public were also paying attention to the future British-Indian relations. For example, the Liberal Party's "News Chronicle" hoped that the two sides, India and the United Kingdom, would still cooperate effectively, which is necessary to prevent the Communist forces from creating a fragmented situation in Asia. The Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" also said that if India believes that it must withdraw from the Commonwealth, it would be unfavorable to both the United Kingdom and India. The British media's attention to India can also be imagined.

On the Indian side, Prime Minister Nehru had made two suggestions to the Indian Parliament before going to the United Kingdom: (1) Recognize that the Indian people have dual nationality, that is, they are citizens of both the Indian Republic and the British Empire; (2) Continue to maintain political ties with the Empire after India's independence. At the same time, the National Congress Party also held a secret meeting to discuss the issue of India striving for independence at the British Empire Conference. It is said that there are also two different opinions in the National Congress Party. One is to advocate that India completely break away from the shackles of the British Empire and become an independent republic; the other is to advocate that India should still participate in the British Empire even if it implements the new constitution of the Indian Republic. Nehru holds this opinion.

India is a large country in Asia and also an ancient country with a long history and culture. India's history is bizarre and has everything. It is really a history of the old era. The beginning of the new history started on August 15, 1947. The history of India can be roughly divided into three stages: from the Aryan immigration to India and the emergence of Brahmanism to the beginning of the Gupta dynasty in 320 AD, a period of 700 years, which is a period from primitive nomads to the establishment of feudal imperial and religious power; to the 200 years after Babur established the Mughal dynasty in 1526, which is the period when the feudal Mughal dynasty invaded India and began feudal separatism; from 1757 when Clive won the Battle of Plassey, laying the foundation for the East India Company's dominant power, until 1947, it was the period when the British Empire invaded and ruled India. In the old century of India, the Indian people suffered oppression, division, and exploitation. Although the promotion of the historical culture of old India produced many religious scholars, thinkers, and philosophers, they failed to save the Indian people. In the old India, only revolutionaries and politicians who could fight for the people and lift the shackles of the British Empire were Gandhi and Nehru, the master and apprentice. Gandhi's life was spent fighting to end the old India. He came naked and left naked, and his life was upright. Nehru's life was also spent fighting to create a new India. The India after August 15, 1947, was a semi-independent and semi-free new India under Nehru's leadership.

The new India has been born for a year and a half. In terms of status, it is only independent in form and has not gained true independence. Furthermore, due to the partition of India and Pakistan and the rise of Pakistan, the entire India has been split into two parts. Under the role of the British Empire's "divide and rule," India and Pakistan still cannot achieve their own independence. At most, it can only be said that the British Empire's 200 years of notification has come to an end. However, it is still subject to constraints and shackles politically, militarily, and especially economically. Speaking of the domestic situation, the new India under Nehru's leadership has indeed made some achievements in the past year and a half. Apart from economic panic and the people's poverty, which have not been overcome, his achievements such as the determination and expansion of the territory of the new India, the improvement of the new India's international status, and the success of his two convocations of Asian conferences undoubtedly symbolize that the new India has become a major country in the Asian continent.

However, this big country still has two kinds of depression: One is that the Indian people all hope that India can achieve true and complete independence. Economically, it should not be dominated by the pound. It is especially afraid of the rising power of the US dollar. They deeply worry that the old slavery has not yet ended, and the new slavery is locked on their heads. This is a kind of depression. Secondly, Nehru's great talent for Asia shows his ambition to lead Asia everywhere, but India itself is not completely independent and free, which hinders his magnificent ambition. Nehru's thinking is a kind of reformist thinking, and his compromise is very strong. After he ascended to power, he felt powerless everywhere. However, the Indian people generally demand independence, and many people within the National Congress Party also demand that the new constitution of the Indian Republic can actually become an independent and free country. The results of Nehru's trip are still difficult to satisfy the wishes of the general Indian people.

The convening of the British Empire Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference is a major event after the establishment of the Atlantic Treaty. Nehru recently said to a reporter from the Daily Mail: If a world war breaks out, India may not participate in the war. This shows India's aversion to international wars; but if India cannot achieve true independence and freedom, then India still cannot avoid war. Now that the conference has ended, and India is still within the Commonwealth, how will Nehru fulfill his promise? The British praised the successful conclusion of this conference as the victory of British Prime Minister Attlee, which actually contains a profound meaning; in other words, the victory of the British Prime Minister is the failure of Nehru; the Indian people will inevitably express disappointment with the results of this conference.

### East-West Negotiations on the Berlin Issue May Reach an Agreement This Week: The U.S., Britain, and France Exchange Views and May Meet with Malik Today; Rumor Has It That the Four Great Powers Will Meet in France

[Report from Our Newspaper] New York 2nd Broadcast: The U.S. spokesperson to the United Nations recently announced: U.S. Ambassador Jessup will meet with British representative Federgan and French representative Schauffel at the U.S. headquarters at the United Nations at 3:00 PM today to discuss the lifting of the Berlin issue and the convening of a four-power foreign ministers' conference. Jessup has been negotiating with Soviet representative Malik on the German issue for a total of seven times. After meeting with Acheson and others this morning, Jessup left Washington for New York. It is expected that Jessup will meet with Malik again soon (possibly on the 3rd), and British and French representatives may participate in the meeting for the first time.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 2nd] French Foreign Minister Schumann stated at a press conference this morning: It is not possible to determine the date of the Western power foreign ministers' conference within this week. He expressed optimism about the possibility of convening this plenary session. He also revealed that the proposal to convene this meeting in Paris was not proposed by France itself. He said: Neither France nor the United States can allow this endless negotiation between the East and West. When asked whether the Soviet Union and anti-British and French countries would participate in the negotiations, he said that he did not know about it. When asked whether the negotiations would be based on the East and West or the four powers, Schumann said that it would be very reasonable in the initial stage of the negotiations. When reporters asked whether Britain was making various preparations to delay the four-power conference, Schumann said that the United Kingdom and France have always maintained a consistent attitude in responding so far. However, there are currently slight differences of opinion between the two countries, but there are no fundamental differences. Schumann concluded that convening a meeting of several people is precisely to find a middle ground.

[United Press, New York, 2nd] The date for the Soviet Union to lift the Berlin blockade may be set within this week. When the U.S. and Soviet representatives meet again in the next few days, an agreement to lift the blockade may be reached, and the date for the four foreign ministers' conference may be set. The conference period will be around the end of the month or the beginning of next month, and the location will probably be in Paris.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 1st] Radio commentator Pearson said tonight that when Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vanyominco and British Minister of State McNeil met on New York Island last week, they talked about preparing for a four-man summit meeting in Paris between Truman, Stalin, and Curie. US Undersecretary of State Rusk will also be present. The talks went well. According to Pearson, Stalin is preparing to travel to Paris by train and has sent two private letters to President Truman, mentioning the lifting of the Berlin blockade and the cessation of the Cold War. The official will undoubtedly deny it at this time.

### Korean Commission Completes Inspection of South Korea

[United States Information Service, Lake Success, 1st] Several members of the United Nations Korean Commission and personnel from the Commission's Secretariat recently inspected South Korea and have now completed their itinerary for April. According to reports received here at UN headquarters, the inspecting party included the Commission Chairman, representatives from China, Australia, France, and India, personnel from the Korean Transfer and U.S. Liaison Committee, and government officials.

It is noted that the Korean Commission was established by the UNGA in December 1947 to continue the work of the Temporary Commission. The Temporary Commission had supervised the general election in South Korea. The Republic of Korea was established as a result of that election. The UN-supervised election only took place in South Korea, as UN agencies were consistently denied entry into the Soviet-controlled area of North Korea. The new Commission is composed of Australia, China, El Salvador, France, India, the Philippines, and Syria. Its mission is to assist in implementing UN resolutions and promoting the unification and independence of Korea.

The Indonesian side stated that it could not make any decisions regarding the Dutch proposals until the Indonesian government is restored and functioning.

### Allied Powers' Strict Military Control Over Japan Has Transformed Into Friendly Guidance; MacArthur Announces on the Anniversary of the New Japan's Birth

[United Press, Tokyo, 2nd] MacArthur stated today in a statement commemorating the second anniversary of the promulgation of the new Japanese Constitution that the objectives outlined at the Potsdam Conference, many of which have not been completed, have been diligently fulfilled by Japan. The reason why the Allied forces have not yet withdrawn is not due to Japan's fault, but due to its inability to control external circumstances. The Allied occupation has transformed from strict military control into friendly guidance by a protective power. This transitional period will continue to progress rapidly as Japan assumes the responsibility of self-governance. However, the Japanese people should strictly guard against the infiltration of concepts that distrust human wisdom, hinder individual dignity, and severely restrict individual freedom. This is the second anniversary of the birth of the New Japan. It must be understood that there is no greater human purpose than to defend the rights granted by the Constitution. Japan can thereby ensure its peaceful and orderly progress.

### Jewish Forces in Southern Jerusalem Complete Military Operations

Bishop Ordered Villagers to Resist

Although no official statement has been issued here or in Jerusalem regarding this matter, it is reported that conflicts occurred when Israeli forces, acting in accordance with the agreement between Israel and Transjordan, advanced to occupy villages near Haifa and Jerusalem. According to well-informed sources, with the exception of only one village that was occupied peacefully, all the villagers and guerrillas silently continued to resist under the orders of the Archbishop of Jerusalem. Therefore, Israel launched an attack, completing the operation within two hours, and then withdrew. Jerusalem was under strict guard for two and a half hours due to an accident and the explosion of several shells.

### Lovett Asks U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee to Approve the Atlantic Pact; Norway and Iceland Participate and are Subjected to Pressure

[Report from This Newspaper] Washington, 2nd, broadcast: Former Undersecretary of State Lovett stated to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that small countries such as Norway and Iceland joined the North Atlantic Pact voluntarily, denying that major powers had exerted pressure on them. He pointed out that the pact is absolutely necessary for the security of the United States and world peace, and requested the Foreign Relations Committee to approve the pact.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 2nd] Former Secretary of State Lovett will appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today to express his views on the North Atlantic Treaty. This will be the fourth day of hearings, which will not be open to the public. The first session began last Wednesday, when Secretary of State Acheson testified. The hearings are expected to last for several weeks. During this time, the committee will hear the views of both supporters and opponents of the defense pact. It is generally expected that Army Chief of Staff General Bradley, former Secretary of the Army Patterson, and others will express their support for the pact this week, while those presenting opposing testimony will include Wallace. After all those invited have expressed their views, the Foreign Relations Committee will hold a closed session and draft a report. The treaty will then be submitted to the full Senate for debate and final action. The treaty must be approved by a two-thirds majority in the Senate before it becomes binding on the United States. General Bradley will be asked to express how military assistance can supplement the pact. During last week's hearings, Secretary of State Acheson and Secretary of Defense Johnson both commented on the proposed arms assistance program. Although the North Atlantic Treaty and the proposed military assistance program for the contracting states are related in the committee's discussions, these two will still require separate legislative actions. The North Atlantic Treaty only requires Senate approval. The military assistance program still needs to be formally submitted to Congress, and this program will require action by both the House and the Senate, as well as the allocation of funds. Currently, the committee is hearing opinions on the approval of the Atlantic Pact, and will also hear about the military assistance program.

### European Countries Hold Grand Ceremonies for May Day Labor Day; Stalin Personally Inspects Troops and Workers' Processions

[United Press, Moscow, 1st] Today, on May Day Labor Day, President Stalin, along with members of the Soviet Communist Party Politburo and the Central Committee, stood atop Lenin's Mausoleum in the brilliant sunlight for an hour-long military parade to celebrate the holiday. Above the square, Stalin's son, Major General Vasily Stalin, led an air force performance to demonstrate the progress of Soviet jet aircraft capabilities. U.S. Embassy Air Force Attaché Lieutenant Colonel Rendell commented, "The Soviet Air Force's skills have made considerable progress." U.S. Embassy Army Attaché Major General O'Donnell commented, "The grandeur of the military parade has never been seen before."

[Reuters, London, 1st] Union leaders and workers around the world celebrated May Day Labor Day today. In West Berlin, clashes occurred because police prevented workers from going to East Berlin to participate in the celebrations. In the Eastern Bloc countries, grand ceremonies such as parades and military reviews were held. Marshal Stalin, as usual, reviewed the parade of troops and a grand procession of one million workers in Red Square. He stood atop Lenin's Mausoleum for several hours, looking energetic and smiling. The latest Soviet aircraft, including three jet-propelled aircraft, soared through the sky in a performance. The incident in West Berlin was caused by the U.S. authorities only allowing the anti-communist General Confederation of Trade Unions to march within the U.S. sector. A group of workers attempted to pass through the U.S. sector to participate in the demonstration in the Soviet sector. They were driven away by police with batons, and several people were injured. Tens of thousands of workers gathered in Freedom Square in the Soviet sector of Berlin. In Amsterdam, the Netherlands, 45,000 people held a May Day celebration, which was hosted by the Dutch Communist Party. A large demonstration of 300,000 people was held in the Romanian capital, with the phrase "peace" being the most prominent in the banners and slogans. The Norwegian Labor Party and Communist Party jointly held an unprecedented march in Oslo, with no unfortunate incidents occurring. The banners carried by Communist Party members were mostly directed at Truman, Churchill, and the Atlantic Pact. In Belgrade, 100,000 workers, farmers, women, and children marched past Marshal Tito. The procession lasted for seven hours. Tito wore a white marshal's uniform and stood on the command platform, which was decorated with a huge red star symbol and large portraits of Stalin, Lenin, Marx, and Engels. Paris was unusually quiet today, as most workers took the day off.

### U.S. Decommissions Central Pacific Air Force Command

All Fighters and Bombers Transferred Elsewhere

[United Press, Washington, 1st] From next month, air defense in the Central Pacific will rely entirely on naval aviation and Marine Corps aviation. The Air Force Department recently announced that the Pacific Air Force Command will be decommissioned on June 1st. The command has gradually reduced its scope over the past two years, and now only has a small number of transport detachments and one fighter squadron of about 75 aircraft. After these remaining troops are withdrawn to the United States, the Air Force will not leave a single fighter or bomber in the Central Pacific. In the future, the nearest major base will be Guam, and other units will be based in Japan, Okinawa, and the Philippines. At the same time, the naval center is also shifting from the Pacific, and the European situation is giving the Atlantic strategy new value. The Navy used to station hundreds of warships in the Pacific, but this has now been reduced to 96 ships, and coastal stations have also been reduced accordingly. The current fleet includes five aircraft carriers (two 27,000-ton Essex-class carriers and three 14,500-ton light aircraft carriers). Air defense in the Central Pacific will rely entirely on the fighter and bomber squadrons on these five aircraft carriers. The five ships carry a total of approximately 300 aircraft, commanded by the Naval Aviation and Marine Corps Aviation Commands. In addition to the aircraft carriers, the Pacific Fleet also has six cruisers, 53 destroyers and destroyer escorts, and 32 submarines. After the Pacific Air Force Command is disbanded, the air transport unit in the area will be incorporated into the mixed air-sea organization of the "Military Air Transport Service."

### Disbanding German Industry Has Achieved Incomparable Success, According to Clay's Response to Investigator

Clay Responds to Investigation into Allegations Regarding Country's Actual Situation

[United Press, Frankfurt, Germany, 1st] U.S. Military Governor of Germany Clay submitted a report to the War Department today in response to allegations from investigating countries that U.S. authorities in Germany had not disbanded large German industrial and commercial organizations. Clay said that disbanding large German industry has achieved unparalleled success. We have issued more than 1,100 notices of dissolution of large industrial organizations. Germany's highly centralized financial system has been destroyed and replaced by a decentralized system similar to the Federal Reserve System in the United States, and the scope of activities of its branches is also restricted.

### U.S. Dismantling of German Industry Proceeding Extremely Slowly

Due to Conflict with Military Government Plans

[United States Information Service, Washington, 2nd] According to the final report of the investigative committee appointed by U.S. Secretary of the Army Royal in December 1940, the U.S. plan to dismantle industrial alliances in Germany is indeed a sound policy, but the results have been very slow. This recently released report makes twelve recommendations to improve the plan to dismantle industrial alliances. The report states that the reasons for the plan's slow progress are as follows: (1) The Soviet authorities in Germany are not cooperating; (2) The United Kingdom lacks enthusiasm for the overall plan; (3) U.S. authorities are prioritizing the promotion of Germany's economic recovery and neglecting the fragmentation of its industry. In order to explain the above three recommendations, the investigative committee's report recounts the different opinions between the committee and U.S. Military Governor General Clay regarding how to deal with the two major factories that constitute the district's activities. One of the factories is the Ting Schiel Locomotive Factory, which specializes in manufacturing locomotives for the government-owned railway system. General Clay, feeling that transportation was at a standstill, took a cautious approach and historically implemented the dismantling action in order to maintain the production of the Ting Schiel Company. Similarly, General Clay believed that Germany's only steel ball manufacturing plant was essential for restoring Germany's economy. The report of the three-person committee is currently being studied by Assistant Secretary of the Army Fuchs. The members of the committee are Federal Trade Commissioner Ferguson (Chairman), New York City lawyer Essex, and Chicago employer advisor Kiana. The three-person group spent several weeks in Germany last December conducting research. After making a preliminary study of the report, Fuchs pointed out that the committee's task was to study the plan for the decentralization of German industry and the dissolution of German trade associations, while General Clay had to ensure that the plan for the dissolution of trade associations must be coordinated with the urgent need for German economic recovery, which was a very difficult task.

### Former Irish Prime Minister Hopes Northern Ireland Will Not Turn Its Back on Unification; Hopes Britain Will End the Divided State of Ireland

[Reuters, London, 1st] Former Irish Prime Minister Éamon de Valera addressed a meeting of the "Irish Anti-Partition League" here today, revealing that the British Prime Minister had expressed to him his hope that the division of Northern and Southern Ireland could be ended. De Valera said that if the British government truly had this intention, why didn't it publicly announce its good intentions? On the contrary, it has been widely rumored that the British government will reaffirm its declaration to maintain the divided state of Northern and Southern Ireland. He specifically warned the British government that if this happened, it would only increase hatred between Britain and Ireland.

### Truman Reduces U.S. Air Force Bases

Air Force Chief of Staff Expresses Regret

[Agence France-Presse, Indianapolis, 1st] U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg stated in an address at the American Legion convention on the night of the 1st that the reduction in the number of U.S. Air Force bases from 59 to 48 in President Truman's 1950 budget proposal, in order to save expenses, was most regrettable. Vandenberg said that due to this reduction, the United States could only avoid defeat and protect itself if a war were to break out. He also said that of these 48 bases, 14 would need to accommodate 36 Super Bombers.

### British Labour Leader Reveals Election Plans

Attlee Emphasizes the Four Freedoms of the Communist Party

[Reuters, London, 1st] Prime Minister Attlee and other Labour leaders have roughly revealed the Communist Party's election plans for 1950 in their May Day speeches today. Attlee, in an address at a political gathering in Norwich, emphasized that the Communist Party's creed is based on four freedoms: freedom of speech and thought, freedom to choose the government, freedom of the individual from oppression by the strong, and freedom of the individual from economic tyranny by the few. Today's concept of freedom is no longer the freedom advocated by old-fashioned individualists, where individuals arbitrarily fight for dominance. True freedom can only exist in an organized society, where blind economic forces are controlled in the public interest. Attlee also emphasized the benefits that the British people receive under the social insurance system, and said that this system has aroused great interest in the United States, and President Truman also intends to launch a similar plan.

### American Obstetrics Professor Invents Pregnancy Test Method

Proof Can Be Obtained in Minutes

[United Press, Chicago, 2nd] Li Quixson, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University Medical School here, has invented a simple pregnancy test method that is completely accurate and reliable and can be proven in a doctor's office in just a few minutes. This test method is based on the reaction of a simplified chemical reagent to the urine of pregnant women. According to Li's report at a joint meeting of obstetrics and gynecology societies in Chicago and St. Louis Canlans, he has used this method to test more than 1,000 women in five years, and it can accurately detect pregnancy even at an early stage. This method eliminates the need for laboratory animals and is four times faster than the simplest method currently in use. Results can be obtained half an hour after obtaining the urine sample.

### De Gaulle Takes the Opportunity to Launch a Fierce Attack on the French Government's Policy Towards Germany; Calls for the Joint Establishment of Another Regime

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 1st] General de Gaulle stated in a May Day public rally to the "Rally of the French People" today that "the Communist Party is building the largest empire in history." He attacked the French government for spreading a shameful atmosphere of optimism and using chloroform anesthesia on the French people, and said that the current government is "a team of mediocrities." He also fiercely criticized the French government's policy towards Germany as "tending towards the establishment of a fourth German republic, and succumbing to the British and American policy towards Germany, abandoning France's traditional policy, which is to incorporate the German states and the Ruhr region into a true European Federation." De Gaulle called on members of the People's Group to help him change this unsatisfactory French regime, and to jointly establish another regime with him to implement the opinions supported by the majority. Speaking of national defense issues, De Gaulle said that France should establish an appropriate national defense force capable of playing an effective role in the work of defending Europe. De Gaulle continued to declare that the Atlantic Pact is still quite vague regarding the actual military assistance that France can obtain when attacked. He also criticized the Allied strategy of making Britain the main bulwark of European defense, rather than France. He also attacked the current French government, saying: "The current government is drifting with the tide." De Gaulle concluded by saying: "We need to re-establish national unity, and especially need to first restore national authority, which is the sole goal of the People's Group."

### From Acheson's Perspective on American Diplomacy

— By Hash

Translated from "The Christian Science Monitor"

Now, American foreign policy will shift its focus and direction. By what method, and to what extent? President Truman's acceptance of the resignations of his two top State Department officials, Marshall and Lovett, and the appointment of Acheson and Webb as successors, has become the culmination of a series of events. The heads of state and diplomatic agencies of every country in the world are probably contemplating this issue. However, if it were not for the following events, the personnel changes in the State Department would not have been so prominent and so urgently in need of understanding.

During the presidential election, Truman's remarks suggested that he was confident that he would eventually be able to achieve a reasonably satisfactory peace with the Soviet Union. Columnist Franklin, who served as a speechwriter for the presidential campaign, predicted on November 29 that the government's policy would get rid of what he called the "Byrnes-Marshall-Forrestal" plan. This column was denied by the President. However, on December 27, Truman announced his opinion that peace with the Soviet Union was possible, and he decided to use his next four years in office to seek it. He added his view that there were divisions within the Kremlin, and that some of its leaders wanted peace.

The climax came in early January. Franklin wrote another column in a popular publication, this time in "Life" magazine. But Truman once again denied Franklin's assessment, namely that Truman had reversed course and would make a radical shift in American foreign policy towards being friendly to the Soviets. However, the highly reliable and well-informed columnist Lippmann, who believed that Franklin's claim was not worth taking seriously and said that the American economy did not follow the same murderous or theoretical direction that Kremlin foreign policy followed, but who had evidence to confirm Truman's claim that there were divisions within the Kremlin, made the following observation:

"In my view, the President's intuition that the entire conflict (between the West and the Soviet Union) should be re-evaluated, reviewed, and reconsidered, and that the diplomatic deadlock should be broken by active measures, perfectly explains the situation in Europe and the prospects for Western society."

Then came the resignation of Secretary of State Marshall and the appointment of Acheson as his successor. What is the significance of these events? In my opinion, Franklin not only oversimplified the significance, but also exaggerated it. First, Acheson had served as Undersecretary of State under Marshall and had cooperated with him most harmoniously. Second, Acheson was the initiator of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. Therefore, the personnel change from Marshall to Acheson does not necessarily imply a radical political change. Acheson's track record can serve as a prelude, masking any strong assumption that he might be "soft on the Soviets" or have a tendency towards "appeasement." A person who sent American military equipment and advisors to Greece to help fight communism, and who launched the Marshall Plan, which became anathema to Moscow, cannot be expected to overturn the entire policy contained in these actions.

In my opinion, the emphasis and significance lie in more complex nuances. Naturally, changes are still uncertain, but I would say that the change does not come from a sense of altered sentiment or any reversal of hope, but, as Lippmann sees it, from the fact that the underlying situation affecting foreign policy is changing, and therefore policy should be adjusted to adapt to this change. Franklin believes that the "Byrnes-Marshall-Forrestal policy" was a bad thing and should therefore be abandoned now. My understanding is that Truman and Acheson have reached an agreement and are jointly participating in the formulation of a policy dictated by the times. This policy represents a necessary strategy to protect Western society during this post-war recovery period, and also represents the opportunity for American diplomacy to rebuild its ability to cope with the post-war forces of communism and Soviet expansion. Therefore, if there is a change in policy, the change is not the result of an understanding that the past was wrong, but the result of an assessment. This assessment recognizes that policy has mostly achieved its goal of rebuilding the West's ability to cope, and that the time is approaching when the new ability to cope can be used to push the Soviet Union towards a new and rational attitude of reducing the power struggle.

I also believe that Marshall's physical strength could have continued his position as Secretary of State, this same change could have also occurred. In other words, this situation is not a change of policy, but a development of the policy and logic of the Byrnes-Marshall era. That policy was by no means merely aimed at being "tough on the Soviets," but simply at strengthening Western power to the point where it could reach a solution with the Soviet Union that was favorable to Western security.

But among all these factors contributing to change, there are some incidental factors. Secretary of State Marshall was the most respected and influential military figure in America during the war, and Lovett was transferred from the War Department to become Undersecretary of State. Acheson is a non-military lawyer. Webb, who succeeded Lovett, had previously been the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, and before that, a non-military lawyer who assisted members of Congress. Second, Webb played a significant role when he was Director of the Budget, when Truman insisted on a military budget of 15 billion, opposing the 23 billion advocated by the military.

Therefore, the influence of the boundary between the State Department and the Department of Defense on diplomacy will be reduced in the future. The appointment of Acheson and Webb is due to their careful compliance with the authority of the White House during their terms of office. In the State Department under Byrnes, Byrnes' relationship with Truman eventually became strained. At that time, Acheson was Undersecretary of State, and he was very respectful to Byrnes, but he also tried to avoid any accusations of going over Truman's head.

Therefore, another meaning of this matter is that the White House will have more direct control over foreign policy. During Marshall's tenure as Secretary of State, Truman had completely entrusted foreign policy matters to Marshall, and now he is placing people in senior positions who are compliant with his opinions and can be expected to carry out his own proposals.

Truman has four more years in office and does not need to rush. He has time to implement his policies at his leisure. He believes that now is the time to try to reduce the power struggle, and naturally he will take advantage of this opportunity. As for what method to adopt, that is the question. Of course, Truman will not be more in favor of "appeasement" than Acheson.

### Property Construction Donation Business Tax: Finance Bureau Adjusts Implementation; City Government Salary to be Issued Tomorrow or the Day After

[Our Newspaper] The adjustment of the donation rate for the city's property donation and municipal construction donation was submitted by the municipal government to the Municipal Council for review. Except for the cancellation of the "graded progressive" method, the rest were approved as proposed and have been levied since May 1. Our reporter visited Director Qian of the Finance Bureau, who said that the adjustment of the property construction donation was due to the excessive depreciation of the currency, and the original donation amount was small, which was not enough to cover the collection costs. Moreover, taxpayers did not have the same amount of banknotes to pay, which was ridiculed by public opinion and citizens' letters. The Finance Bureau's duty was to handle it early, but because the tax adjustment had to be approved by the Municipal Council, the economic situation completely changed during the months of recess, and it could no longer be delayed. Therefore, the municipal government urged an early meeting so that it could be implemented as soon as possible. As for the original "graded progressive" method, it was originally intended to reduce the burden on ordinary citizens and enable those with property and higher living standards to pay more taxes. Since it has been revoked by the public opinion organs, it should be followed. The remaining key points of the adjustment are approximately: (1) Starting from the summer season, it will be changed to monthly collection. (2) The donation amount in the autumn of the 37th year will be used as the tax base for property construction donations in the future. (3) The job index (i.e., salary index) of the last period of the month before the levy will be multiplied to be the donation amount payable. (4) The spring property construction donation for this year will be multiplied by the index at the end of April and collected together with April.

Furthermore, the adjustment of the city's business tax was also discussed at a meeting of the Review Committee on Saturday afternoon of last week, and it was decided that (1) starting from the summer of this year, the business tax will also be changed to monthly collection. (2) The donation amount in the autumn of the 37th year will be used as the tax base for business tax in the future. (3) The base will be multiplied by the price index on the last day of the month before the levy to be the amount of tax payable. (4) It must be paid within five days from the date of delivery. If it is overdue for one day, the original tax amount will be adjusted and collected according to the latest living index, and a penalty of 5% will be added. This is calculated in the same way as "compound interest." The punishment method for property construction donations is also handled in the same way.

The adjustment method for land value tax has also been amended and passed by the Municipal Council, and the implementation date will be determined separately by the Land Administration Bureau. The "Gasoline Sales Donation Collection Method" originally proposed by the municipal government has been retained.

Recently, prices have been high and public educators have a hard life. Regarding the public education index, the central government announced yesterday that it is 100,000 times. When will the public education salary be issued in this city, which is the most concerned issue of the municipal government? It has also been learned that this funding, including the supplementary payment for April and the advance payment for May, requires a total of more than 600 billion yuan. The Finance Bureau is making every effort to raise funds, and it is expected to be issued tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

### Yang Chuo'an Unable to Bear Leaving for the South, Resigns as Deputy Minister of Finance to Stay in Shanghai to Raise Food; Amount Transported to Shanghai Can Supply Three Months

[Our Newspaper] The food problem of Shanghai's six million citizens has been safely overcome over the years through the supply of household rice by the Emergency Food Procurement and Storage Association and the US Economic Cooperation Administration, which has not been interrupted. At this time of year when the old harvest is running out and the new harvest is not yet ready, and due to the situation, the source is on the verge of being cut off, the extreme seriousness of the city's food problem is beyond words. If a large amount of food is not purchased and stored at this time, I am afraid that there will be a shortage of food soon. Mr. Yang Chuo'an, the director of the Food Storage Association, in view of this, has been running around to find ways to not only request the allocation of foreign exchange from the Central Bank to purchase more than 20,000 tons of foreign rice (approximately 300,000 piculs), but also to agree with the US Economic Cooperation Administration to continue transporting the previously scheduled American rice to Shanghai without transferring it elsewhere. It is estimated that the food storage association, the US Economic Cooperation Administration, and the Shanghai Free Market have about 160,000 tons of grain in stock (approximately 2.2 million piculs), including the amount that can be purchased and transported to Shanghai successively before the end of June, which can supply Shanghai's citizens with food for three months. It is also heard that Mr. Yang has resigned from his position as Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance in order to focus on planning the food supply for the citizens of Shanghai. The telegram stated that "the Shanghai food situation is serious and I cannot bear to leave for the south."

After passenger tickets on the two lines were sold in silver dollars, the authorities considered that this move violated the laws of the gold yuan standard and corrected it. Therefore, the purchase of tickets with gold yuan notes was restored yesterday, and silver dollars were no longer accepted. The fares were converted according to 4 million yuan per silver dollar. The new fares are as follows: From Shanghai North to Jiaxing or Lujiabang, third class 4 million yuan, second class 8 million yuan, first class 12 million yuan.

### Long Queue in Front of the Social Bureau: Concurrent Operation of Silver Dollar Stores: Registration is Very Enthusiastic: The First Batch of Permits to be Completed Before the 8th

[Our Newspaper] Since the Garrison Department strictly stipulated that a permit must be obtained before selling silver dollars, the stores in the city that concurrently operate silver dollar sales have been very enthusiastic about registering with the Social Bureau. Yesterday, a long queue formed in front of the Social Bureau. Each application form costs 50,000 yuan. The first batch of 3,000 application forms was issued yesterday afternoon. After the merchants filled out the forms and sent them to the bureau, the permits were issued immediately. 600 permits can be issued every day. The bureau will be open as usual on Sundays. It is expected that it will be completed before the 8th of this month. Stricter inspections will be conducted by the military police starting from the 9th, and those who operate without a license will be banned. The second batch of 5,000 application forms will then be registered and distributed. The method has been slightly changed, and each form has been changed to a registration fee of 250,000 yuan. The requirement to affix two photos has been cancelled, and only the business registration certificate of each store is required to apply. Stores with a shop but without a business registration certificate must have a certificate issued by a store that has already registered, proving that the shop has a capital of more than 50 silver dollars. If scalpers are found to be impersonating stores to apply, they will be severely punished after being found out. Stall vendors or individuals who sell silver dollars on the roadside must apply to the police station, and the Social Bureau will not handle it.

### Source of Silver Dollars Seems Strong: Street Hype Lower

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday's silver dollar market situation, because the authorities announced a strict order to buy and sell silver dollars, must register and obtain a license, otherwise, if found out, in addition to the confiscation of silver dollars, the identity card will be cancelled and deported. General firms are wary. Street silver scalpers also did not dare to shout loudly and openly, and buying interest turned light. Because the Central Bank announced that 4 million is equivalent to one, the factories mostly issued silver dollars, resulting in supply exceeding demand. Yuan Datou, in the morning, amid a sell-off, fell to a minimum of 3 million, 3.5 million. Near noon, it rose slightly to 3.3 million, 3.6 million, 3.7 million, mostly only selling and not buying, and the foothold was quite weak. In promissory note transactions, Datou fell to a minimum of 4 million, 4.5 million, and finally shouted 5 million, 6 million.

### Stock Market Rise to Limit Up, Off-Exchange Bids for Weaker

Xinguang, Meiya, and others saw demand at 15% above the listed price, but many holders were still unwilling to sell. The market remained at the limit without breaking through, and no transactions occurred.

### Gold Market Plunges Yesterday After Days of Excessive Gains

Plunge of seventy to eighty percent compared with last week's highest price

[Our Report] Yesterday, the gold market softened, plunging by about 70% to 80% compared with last week's peak.

Off-exchange spot prices opened at 350 million to 400 million, then plummeted to 230 million to 280 million, before slightly rising to 310 million to 340 million at noon. Afternoon trading was sparse, and transactions were thin, having reached as high as 350 million to 380 million, before closing at 320 million to 370 million.

The decline in the off-exchange U.S. dollar was relatively slow, as rumors circulated that the U.S. dollar in the north was trading at three to one, which calmed investor sentiment. Small investors actively exchanged currency. The morning opening was 7.5 million to 8 million, briefly falling to 5 million to 5.5 million, before closing at 6.3 million to 6.8 million at noon. In the afternoon, it rose to 7 million to 7.5 million, eventually closing at 6.8 million to 7.3 million, down 700,000 from the previous day.

The exchange ratio of gold and silver at the stock exchange building fluctuated rapidly. The initial quote for silver dollars was 38 to 41, then gradually decreased to 35 to 38, before closing even lower at 34 to 37 in the afternoon.

The street trade in nickel coins was quite active. It was heard that in Qingdao, one yuan in nickel coins could be exchanged for one silver dollar. Individual buyers were actively seeking them out, with 20-cent nickel coins bid at 120,000 to 150,000. Ten-cent coins were bid at 60,000 to 80,000. Five-cent coins were bid at 30,000 to 50,000.

### Rice Prices Show Slight Increase

Flour Sales Particularly Strong, Trend Firm

The rice market showed a slight increase. Arrivals were scarce, and investor sentiment remained stable, so there were fewer sellers. In the North City market, top-grade white rice was equivalent to 5.6 silver yuan, a slight increase of 0.1 yuan. Converted at a rate of 4 million, it was 22.4 million yuan, an increase of 10 million yuan compared with last Saturday. Thin rice was 5.5 yuan. In the South City market, top-grade white rice was 5 yuan, and thin rice was 5.2 yuan, similar to last Saturday. Early rice increased by 0.1 yuan. Converted at a rate of 4 million in gold yuan notes, top-grade white rice was 20 million, thin rice was 20.8 million, and early rice was 19.2 million.

Edible oil prices were initially stable, then increased. Because actual sales in the main streets were still active, many were replenishing their stocks from the market, making the market brisk. The current cash price for soybean oil was 54 million to 57 million yuan, rapeseed oil was 42 million to 46.5 million yuan, and raw oil was 45 million to 51 million yuan. Converted to silver dollars, soybean oil was 18 yuan, rapeseed oil was 15.5 yuan, and raw oil was 16 yuan, each up by 1.5 to 2 yuan. Soybean cake remained unopened.

Amidst the decline of various commodities, flour alone showed firmness. As the currency shortage was resolved and silver dollar transactions were active, the market was flourishing. Old-brand flour initially opened at 4.2 million, but sales in the main streets were particularly strong, once surging to 5 million. Later, holders took profits at high prices, falling back to 4.5 million. Bingchuan flour opened at 3.6 million, and traded as high as 4.2 million in the central market, before closing at 3.9 million, an increase of 20% compared with last Saturday. Large bags of Fuxin bran were 3.6 million, equivalent to 1.2 silver yuan.

### Cotton Cloth Market Still Stagnant, Off-Exchange Bids Plummet

The cotton cloth market remained inactive. Investor sentiment was stable. Overseas prices shifted from firm to weak. Off-exchange barter traders saw prices decline from around 4.2 yuan to 3.9 yuan. Ultimately, high-quality fabrics such as "Four Gentlemen" gabardine and "Dragon Head" fine cloth were generally traded at 20 million gold yuan notes per bolt. The market consistently saw no transactions. Private mills continued to adjust prices. High-end Shilin increased to 55 million, and Daming silk pongee was 3,000 yuan, both increasing by around 10%.

### Cotton Yarn Sales Weaken

Cotton yarn transactions were sparse yesterday, and investor sentiment was subdued. Overseas prices were generally soft, and mills also frequently opened for sales. Sales became sluggish. 21-count horse-brand spot goods were bid at 73 million, and warehouse receipts were 66 million, down 20 million from last Saturday. 42-count Blue Phoenix declined to 114 million, also down slightly by 8.4 million. The above prices were converted according to the rise and fall of gold prices.

### Local News Briefs

### Tense Table Tennis Match: Choubai Team Wins Against Postal Service After Hard Battle

Three More B-Group Matches Today

In the fourth Table Tennis League, Choubai played against the Postal Service in the A-group the night before last. The venue was temporarily changed to the Postal Service's table tennis room. The Postal Service was well-prepared and had a strong presence. Choubai players rushed to the venue from the Jingzong table tennis room one after another, in good spirits. In the first match, Postal Service's young player Wang Chuanyao, unafraid of the young, defeated Choubai captain Yang Changxi in two straight games. In the second match, Yang Changjia was also defeated by Postal Service's Jiang Chunshan. Choubai lost two matches in a row, creating an emergency situation. In the third match, Postal Service's main player Liu Zaoshi faced Choubai's Kong Hanchen. Zaoshi was a well-rounded player and had been selected as a representative of the Shanghai team. Although Kong was an older player who was considered past his prime, it was expected that Zaoshi would win without a doubt. However, Kong, undeterred, fought tenaciously, drawing the ball exceptionally steadily and hitting with ease, as if divinely aided. Zaoshi, facing the Asian Games, was unable to withstand the pressure and lost in two straight games. Subsequently, Choubai's Weng Shuheng seized the opportunity to attack fiercely, playing exceptionally well. Postal Service's Zhuang Kunrong, a hefty player, advanced relentlessly. The two engaged in a fierce three-game battle, with very close scores. Zhuang failed to remain calm and ultimately lost. Relying on the unexpected success of Kong and Weng, Choubai tied the score at two each. In the final match, Choubai turned the tables. Gu Shenghui launched a desperate counterattack, leading all the way. Postal Service's veteran Wang Huizhang repeatedly missed opportunities to win. After a long battle, his endurance failed, and Gu won 2-0. As a result, Choubai miraculously revived, winning 3-2 in a narrow escape. Today (May 3), three more B-group matches will be held. The records of the two teams and today's schedule are listed below:

### Inspecting Mongolia

[Northwest News] The southern part of Chahar-Mongolia is jointly managed by the Chahar tribes, with one banner each (the Right Blue, Right White, Bordered Yellow, Bordered White, Ming'an, Shangdu, and the Right and Left Banners of Tai Temple) and the Doron Lama Printing Office. The population is only 31,319. To the north lies the Xilingol League. Originally, the Xilingol Mongols only had ten banners (East and West Sunid, East and West Abaga, East and West Abagahunar, East and West Harchin, East and West Ujimqin). In the tenth year of the Republic of China, the Buryat people, who had been serving in Outer Mongolia, were incited by the Soviet Union to "revolt." As a result, these Buddhist Buryats fled from Outer Mongolia to Kulunber in Xilingol League. It was not until the eighteenth year of the Republic of China that they moved to the border area between West Harchin and East Abaga. By the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the Panchen Lama arrived in Chahar and petitioned the central government on behalf of the Buryats to establish a banner. Therefore, the current Xilingol League has a total of eleven banners, with a total population of 54,286.

The terrain of Chahar-Mongolia is flat, with clear streams and green fields forming a vast natural grassland. On this vast grassland, countless lives are nurtured. Large herds of cattle, sheep, horses, and camels gallop and chase each other across the grassland. A shepherd boy lies on the grassland, playing with the whip in his hand. A horseman rides on horseback, galloping around the herds, watching over them. When tired, they also lie on the grassland to rest, humming love songs like "Waiting for My Love" that the girls practice singing. A beautiful picture of nature that can only be appreciated on the grasslands of the frontier, and only on the grasslands of the frontier can this natural scene be depicted.

The Mongols do not live in cities, and larger tribes are rarely seen. Usually, there are only four or five or a dozen households. Each village is separated by several or dozens of miles. In the Xilingol League, a small number of princes, lamas, and property owners live in brick and wood buildings. Other people live in mobile yurts, migrating with the availability of water and grass, and needing to move every few days or ten days. Their diet consists mainly of milk tea, beef, mutton, and miscellaneous grains of rice and flour, especially milk tea, which is an indispensable beverage every day. Milk tea is made by boiling brick tea and adding milk or ghee. It has a sweet and salty taste and is as refreshing as a spring. Butter and cheese curds are made from cow and sheep milk, mixed with fried rice, and drunk with milk tea two or three times a day. Wine is also made from cow and horse milk, which is used to entertain guests and as a daily beverage. Cow dung, sheep dung, or camel dung is used for cooking or heating in winter, occasionally with willow branches and dry wood, but the main fuel is still cow dung.

In terms of clothing, cotton cloth is used for clothing in summer, and silk for the nobility. The sleeves are long and the body is wide. In winter, sheepskin and various animal skins are used for clothing. In terms of color, lamas mostly use red and yellow, while other people of all levels wear gray, blue, and green. They all wear colorful silk belts around their waists, with pipes, snuff bottles, knives, flints, necklaces, and Buddha statues inserted on both sides of the belt. They wear leather or cloth boots. Women like to wear gold and silver headbands, inlaid with coral and pearls, adorned with tassels hanging on both sides for decoration. These headbands are very expensive, and the construction style is different in each banner. Unmarried girls only wear earrings and no other ornaments.

The marriage age of Mongol compatriots is around eighteen for both men and women. The wedding ceremony is usually held with the bride being two or three years younger than the groom. The establishment of marriage does not require the consent of the man and woman. It is generally based on the orders of parents and the words of matchmakers. The man asks a matchmaker to negotiate the betrothal gifts with the woman's family. After both parties agree, the man gives the woman's family a small amount of clothing, and the woman's family provides a large dowry of headwear and clothing. On the eve of the wedding, both parties invite male and female relatives and friends to gather for a banquet, and invite a man from the man's family to be the leader, responsible for guiding the wedding. The next day, the groom carries a bow and arrow, dressed as a knight, accompanied by two groomsmen (one older brother and one younger brother) and many guests, all riding fine horses to the woman's house. At that time, relatives and friends of the woman's family line up in front of the door to welcome the guests, exchange greetings, and enter the room, then exchange snuff bottles (a type of etiquette), greetings, and toasting rituals. After various rituals are carried out, they are seated. After three rounds of wine, the groom, groomsmen, and guests go to the room to worship the Buddha, and then to the bride's room to hold the nuptial ceremony. A whole sheep is placed on the table. The groom and bride break a bone of the sheep's leg, and then go outside to ride horses, circling the incense burner three times before inviting the groom back into the house to be seated. After the banquet is over, they return home with the original relatives, friends, and groomsmen. Then the woman's relatives and friends send the bride to the man's house (riding horses, sedan chairs, or cars are all acceptable). The invited godfather leads the new couple to kowtow to heaven, earth, and the kitchen god. After the bride kowtows to heaven, earth, and the kitchen god, she re-combs her hair, changes into women's clothes, and bows to her in-laws, worships the Buddha statue, and then bows to relatives and friends. Three days later, the woman's relatives and friends bring gifts to visit the bride, and within a week, the new couple returns to the bride's home to meet the relatives.

Divorce is extremely simple, without any formalities or procedures. If the two parties disagree and it is difficult to live together, either party only needs to state the reason for the divorce. With the consent of the couple, the reason can be explained to the woman's family at any time, and they are asked to take their daughter back, or the man sends someone to send her back. In this way, the divorce is announced. If there are children, most of them stay with the husband's family. If it is an infant who cannot be separated from the mother, the man negotiates and provides the woman with supplies for raising the child, such as cattle and horses. In the future, when the child grows up, there is a habit of the son returning to the father and the daughter returning to the mother.

### An Embarrassing Incident with the Guizhou Provincial Supervisor of Education: The Commissioner of Education Apologizes with a Letter

[Our Newspaper, Guiyang, 30th via Airmail] The Guizhou Provincial High School, the Second High School, the High School of Agriculture, and the teachers' associations of eight other schools recently requested that the provincial government quickly issue salaries for March and April at 1,500 times each, and requested that public grain and travel expenses be issued to meet urgent needs. Initially, no agreement was reached, resulting in a strike of nearly ten days. Among them, there was an interesting episode: when the faculty and staff of Guiyang Provincial High School were holding a meeting at the school preparing to propose a motion to the faculty and staff association, Supervisor He happened to arrive at the school. This official mistakenly thought that "representatives of various schools were secretly gathering at Guiyang High School to incite a strike," so he turned around and ran back to the Department of Education to report this important intelligence to his superiors. Commissioner Chuan Qixue, who has been excessively nervous recently due to the continuous strikes and demonstrations by college and middle school students, was like a startled bird and naturally believed the report to be true. He immediately went to the conference room of Guiyang High School and, without catching his breath, rudely roared at the faculty and staff who were meeting, without distinguishing between right and wrong. After he calmed down, Principal Liu Xunyu and the faculty and staff of the school felt unfairly wronged and retorted, asking Commissioner Chuan to open his eyes wide and see who in the room was a faculty or staff member of the other seven schools besides the faculty and staff of Guiyang High School. As a result of the counterattack, the principal took the lead and the entire staff resigned. The Commissioner knew that the incident was caused by ["erroneous intelligence"] and ["his own impatience"], so he immediately wrote a personal letter of apology the next day and sent the head of the secondary education section to apologize, saying that ["the recent stomach ailment has made emotions inconsistent and I deeply apologize to all the faculty and staff"]. It is reported that after the letter was formally read aloud by the principal to all the faculty, staff, and students, it was considered to be of great significance and was decided to be handed over to the literature class for filing and investigation as a historical document of the school. This is exactly the same as when he personally signed a guarantee a week later, in front of 5,000 students from the eight provincial high schools who were demonstrating and petitioning, standing in front of the provincial government and refusing to disperse, guaranteeing that all schools would resume classes regularly and permanently.

### Fenghua Declares Martial Law

[Our Newspaper, Fenghua, 27th] The County Self-Defense Headquarters recently issued a notice announcing a special curfew every night from 9:00 PM to 5:00 AM the next morning.

On the 26th, a group of bandits suddenly broke into the Song'ao Township Office. The township head was shot and wounded, and all the guns in the township office were taken away.

The handover ceremony between the new and old County Heads of this county, Fan Kuishu and Zhou Lingjun, was held on the morning of the 29th.

Liu Fugui, the warehouse manager of the County Land and Grain Office in Shangtian, lent all the levied grain to others for profit, so that those from various agencies and schools who went to collect it in recent days were all turned away empty-handed. Zhang Xianjun of the police station (now detained in the court detention center) had previously forged grain tickets, and now the same thing has happened again, so all the issued grain tickets have been rejected.

### A Specialty of Taizhou Fisheries: Songmen White Fish

— Our Newspaper Correspondent, Li Tingbo

[Our Newspaper, Wenling, 28th] Songmen is one of the fishing markets in Taizhou. Songmen's white fish is also one of Taizhou's specialties, famous far and wide, and comparable to Jinhua ham. Because the yellow croaker produced in the Songmen area is fat, fresh, and delicious, the white fish can also enjoy a great reputation. Also, because it is pickled properly, the color and aroma are better than white fish produced elsewhere. However, the production volume has been gradually decreasing every year. Before the war, the annual output was 50,000 to 60,000 catties, which were sold to Hangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Hankou, Fuzhou, and Guangdong, Guangxi, Shandong, Henan, Hunan, and Sichuan. In recent years, due to the decline of the fishing industry, fishermen's fishing is old-fashioned, the equipment is simple, and prices continue to skyrocket, fishermen's lives are difficult, and they cannot organize, repair, or add equipment, so the output has also decreased significantly, with only 30,000 to 40,000 catties per year.

The method of making white fish is that fishermen catch fresh yellow croaker during the tidal season and immediately split it into white fish embryos on the fishing boat or on a nearby small island. The splitting method uses a small sharp blade to split the yellow croaker from the head straight to four inches from the tail. Then bend the back of the fish slightly, take out the internal organs, separate it, and slightly flatten it. Then use a large amount of salt to pickle them one by one. After one or two days, take them out, wash them, and place them on straw to be exposed to the scorching sun. If it doesn't rain, you don't have to take it back, and let it be exposed to the night dew, which makes it taste even fresher. After drying for four or five days, it can be packed and sold to various places.

The characteristics of white fish are that because the famous Songmen white fish is different from the white fish produced elsewhere, it has its own characteristics. The so-called white fish is not completely white. The characteristic of white fish is that all the pectoral fins are combined and closely attached to the abdomen, and the caudal fin is not forked. The whole body has fine scales, the color is shiny, except for the abdomen, pectoral fins, and caudal fin, which are slightly golden, the rest is grayish-white. If you look closely, the golden color emits a faint glow, and the taste is fresh and delicious, and it is popular with everyone. When cooking tofu soup, adding a few slices of white fish meat will make the taste even fresher, while those produced elsewhere and dyed imitations, the scales will never glow, and the taste and color are different, and the pectoral fins and caudal fins are also different.

The storage method is simple. The storage method is quite simple: (1) Remove the fish eyes, because the mold of white fish always starts from the fish eyes and reaches the whole body, turning a good fish all red, and the taste is completely lost. (2) Dry thoroughly before storing. The boneless abdomen should be exposed to the sun when drying. (3) The storage place should have little ventilation and should be dry. Because white fish contains a lot of salt, it is easy to get damp and change color and mold if placed in a place with high temperature. It is best to store the fish in a granary or wheat storage, which will not spoil it, because dry grains and wheat can absorb moisture, so even if there is a high temperature, it will not be affected and will not spoil.

The production season of white fish is all year round, and the best quality is the Fu Fish, "Qiu Fu is a solar term around the seventh lunar month to mid-month," and Fu Fish is divided into Chu Fu, Er Fu, and San Fu, with San Fu being the best quality. During San Fu, the yellow croaker can eat the water along the coast of Songmen, so it is particularly fat and tender, and the taste is particularly fresh. The made white fish is particularly famous, because at this time, the weather is dry and the sun is strong, making it easy to dry the white fish, so drying the white fish also depends on the weather.

### Chongming Fishing Season: Fishing Boats Fully Loaded

[Our Newspaper, Chongming, 28th] This year's fishing season, only Baozhen Port and Shi Qiao River are open. The fishing boats that sailed to the Yellow Sea to catch yellow croaker in the first fishing season have returned one after another. In recent months, the war situation has changed drastically, and people are worried about the order on the sea, but unexpectedly it is more peaceful than in the past. It is said that pirates cannot gain a foothold in the Yellow Sea and have moved to other places. The large sum of "peace money" carried by the fishing boats was actually returned intact. However, the currency value has plummeted. Although it was not given to the pirates, it has already been discounted greatly. The fishermen ran ashore to ask about the price of the goods and were stunned.

Every year there are two fishing seasons. Last year, just after the first fishing season, a spring thunder suddenly came. The fishermen said that when spring thunder sounds, the yellow croaker dives into the deep sea and cannot be caught. Therefore, the second fishing season last year returned empty-handed. These many missed fish have lived an extra year. This year's first fishing season is particularly abundant, and the wind and waves were calm when the fishing boats were at sea, making it easy to cast nets, so all the boats returned fully loaded.

Chongming people love to eat yellow croaker, and the way of eating is very particular. The fish is washed, dried, and pickled in sweet distiller's grains. It can be stored for a long time without spoiling. It is sweet, fragrant, and delicious. Just smelling the taste makes your mouth water, so every family has to buy dozens or hundreds of catties when the fishing boats arrive. In the past, Qidong people also hired small boats to Chongming to wholesale and sell them back, and the harbor was crowded with people. However, the situation has changed greatly this year. Not only have the Qidong people disappeared, but even the local people are sighing at the fish due to the extreme shortage of funds. After several discussions, the fishermen had to implement barter. One pile of fish (about 20 catties) was exchanged for fourteen skeins of 3-ply yarn, or three catties of flowered cloth. In this way, the stalemate was finally broken.

After the first season's yellow croaker is exchanged, the second season can be caught in the Yellow Sea starting from the 28th or 29th.
