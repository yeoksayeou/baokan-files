### Increasing the Number of Peace Talk Representatives: Decision Expected at Today's First Political Affairs Meeting

President He Scheduled to Fly to Guangzhou Next Week to Handle the Handover

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The He Yingqin new cabinet is scheduled to hold its first political affairs meeting at the Presidential Palace at 10:00 AM on the 24th. There are a total of seventeen members, of which, with the exception of Fu Bingchang in the Soviet Union, Hang Liwu and Mo Dehui in Taiwan, Zhang Qun in Sichuan, and Dai Kuisheng in Guangzhou, the rest can all gather in Nanjing on the 24th. The number is sufficient for a quorum, and a formal meeting can be held. At the meeting, He Yingqin will first deliver a speech, explaining the current situation and inviting all cabinet members to encourage each other to overcome the crisis. They will also discuss agenda items, primarily the number and selection of peace talk representatives, and preliminary planning for the departure date. They will also broadly exchange opinions on policy directions. He also scheduled to fly to Guangzhou with Huang Shaogu next week after the new cabinet is officially formed, to conduct a handover with Sun's cabinet. The seal of the Executive Yuan, which Sun's cabinet took to Guangzhou, will also be brought back to Nanjing for use on this trip.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Regarding the dispatch of additional peace talk representatives, He Yingqin invited Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, Weng Wenhao, and others at 4:00 PM on the 23rd for preliminary discussions. It is rumored that in terms of personnel, in addition to the existing Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, and Huang Shaozi, Zhang Shizhao and Mo Dehui were also proposed for the remaining slots. In terms of numbers, it is planned to increase the number from five to six, but no decisions have been made yet. The opinions of the majority of cabinet members will be broadly solicited at the political affairs meeting on the 24th to make a final decision. He also immediately visited the Acting President that evening to report everything.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] It is reported that Zhang Shizhao has agreed to serve as a representative of the government's peace talk delegation. This was decided on the 23rd. He Yingqin spoke to Zhang via long-distance telephone in the evening and obtained Zhang's consent.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Li Acting President’s advisor Gan Jiehou, told United Press reporters today that as soon as the government appoints representatives, peace talks can begin with the Communist side. The number of our peace talk representatives and the date of the peace talks can all be decided by the government. The location of the peace talks will be chosen by the Communist side.

[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Unconfirmed reports here say that both the Nationalists and the Communists hope to announce the list of peace talk representatives before the end of the month. Authoritative sources further stated that the format of the peace talks will be similar to the Nationalists-Communists peace talks held in Chongqing on October 10, 1945. If both parties can negotiate based on Mao Zedong's eight peace conditions, representatives of third parties can also participate in the peace talks.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] According to sources close to Acting President Li, the government's attitude towards peace has not changed due to recent political and military developments. He vehemently refuted the claim that frequent troop movements by the Communist army on the north bank of the Yangtze River will affect the prospects for peace. He said that this type of military action was expected because "We are also preparing for war to seek peace. We certainly cannot expect the Communist army not to make military deployments."

### CCP Broadcasts on Peace Talks, Indicates the Time is Increasingly Urgent

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the Shaanxi-North CCP radio station broadcasted stating, regarding the peace talks, that "the time for peace talks is now increasingly approaching." This indicates that the Communist Party still wants to hold negotiations with the current government. At the same time, the He Yingqin new cabinet of the government has been formed, revealing that the peace delegation is expected to depart for Beiping in early April. This can be seen as an important opportunity in the current situation. The Communist Party believes that the date of the peace talks is near. Once the peace talks begin, it will be clear whether the government will continue the war or accept and implement the Communist Party's eight peace conditions. This reflects that the Communist Party will still insist on the eight points as the basic principles of its negotiations. Yesterday, the CCP broadcast commented on the He Yingqin cabinet, saying that He announced at a reception at the Supervisory Yuan in Nanjing on the 18th that his cabinet was a peace cabinet, but whether He Yingqin's judgment conforms to the facts cannot be verified from each unit of his cabinet, nor can it be verified from his declaration. Therefore, it is not known what role the Nanjing government will play in this peace negotiation. In addition, the CCP made extremely fierce criticisms of the United States and President Chiang in this broadcast, saying that the United States continues to aid and instigate war.

### Xu Kan, Zhang Zhaoyuan, and Sun Zhiping, Supervisory Committee Members Request Simultaneous Impeachment, For Seeking Personal Gain and Malfeasance in Sun Ke's Expenditure of National Funds

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] In the case of Sun Ke's reckless expenditure of huge amounts of national funds under the name of confidential expenses, Supervisory Committee member Hu Wenhui conducted further investigations and recently filed impeachment cases against former Minister of Finance Xu Kan and former Director of the Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office Zhang Zhaoyuan, which will be submitted for review on the 24th. The impeachment document submitted by Committee member Hu stated: "Former Minister of Finance Xu Kan, former Director of the Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Committee Zhang Zhaoyuan, and Sun Zhiping, director of the government shares of the China Industrial Bank, etc., illegally received 110 million yuan in confidential expenses from Executive Yuan President Sun Ke, colluded with each other, befriended wealthy families, abused their powers, and sought personal gain and engaged in malfeasance. They should be impeached together with the case of Executive Yuan President Sun Ke's reckless expenditure of huge amounts of national funds and submitted to the President for strict punishment to rectify the law and discipline and correct official misconduct." According to reliable sources, the facts of Xu Kan, Zhang Zhaoyuan, Sun Zhiping, and others violating the law and engaging in malfeasance are that the Central Bank, on February 10, paid 110 million yuan in confidential expenses to Executive Yuan President Sun Ke pursuant to an order from the Ministry of Finance. On February 15, Luo Zongwen, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, issued a temporary receipt. The Central Bank then submitted a request to the Executive Yuan on February 23 to exchange for a formal receipt. It was not until March 2 that the Ministry of Finance received a formal receipt dated February 10 signed by Zhang Zhaoyuan and Sun Zhiping. Zhang Zhaoyuan received 100 million yuan, and Sun Zhiping received 10 million yuan. According to the provisions of the National Treasury Law, this payment can only be represented by Executive Yuan staff. Zhang Zhaoyuan and Sun Zhiping are not Executive Yuan staff, but they issued a receipt for a huge amount of national funds and even backdated the date, which is obviously malfeasance. Minister of Finance Xu Kan is also difficult to absolve of responsibility.

### Communist Army Threatens to Attack Xinxiang, Now Gradually Strengthening the Outer Perimeter Blockade, National Army Expresses Coexistence with the New City

[Our Xinxiang Dispatch, 23rd] The Communist army is now gradually strengthening the blockade of the outer perimeter of Xinxiang and building fortifications in the Baliying and Tangzhuang areas near the airport to threaten air transport. The National Army is bombarding with heavy artillery on a daily basis. The Communist army has also completed a new highway about three zhang wide between Hebei and Henan and threatened that the Northeast Communist army will soon move south to attack Xinxiang. According to military intelligence, it has been determined that the large number of Communist troops who crossed the river through Dianyang and Changyuan on the 19th are from Nie Rongzhen's troops, mostly new recruits, and equipped with some supplies, and may move south along the Longhai Railway. In addition, the National Army's Independent 9th Division Wang Sanzhu's troops swept the Yanfeng area on the 2nd.

The military is also aware of this real problem, but we adhere to a belief that no matter how the situation deteriorates, we swear to coexist with Xinxiang. If the Communist army invades, we will fight them to the end. The Sui District recently convened officers below the division commander to swear an oath to fight to the end and be loyal to their duties. The Xinxiang National Army is now strengthening its fortifications.

### Central Bank Sells Gold and Silver at High Prices, Supervisory Committee Members to Make Policy Corrections, Tang Honglie and Others Return to Nanjing to Report on the Investigation in Shanghai

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Supervisory Committee members Tang Honglie and Hu Wenhui, who went to Shanghai to investigate the Central Bank's high-priced sale of gold and silver, returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 23rd. After getting off the train, they immediately visited President Yu to report on the investigation in Shanghai and provided an analysis and explanation of the case at the morning court meeting. They will propose a policy correction to the Central Bank's current policy of selling gold and silver. In addition, when the Central Bank sold gold and silver in Shanghai, the pricing was determined by the Stabilization Fund, which also had representatives from the Ministry of Audit participating, but they were not responsible for determining the price. Tang and Hu believe that it seems necessary to withdraw the representatives. They visited President Yu on the morning of the 23rd and explained this intention, and Yu has indicated that he will withdraw the Ministry of Audit representatives from the committee.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The government's policy of selling gold and silver in Shanghai has now become the object of speculation by speculators. They are causing trouble and manipulating the situation, which has obviously defeated the government's policy of selling gold and silver. This policy is indeed a temporary expedient, but it is by no means a permanent solution. To seek economic stability, a fundamental plan must be made, and the policy of selling gold and silver, which is sufficient to promote speculation, must be corrected in time. Supervisory Committee members Tang Honglie and Hu Wenhui made the above conclusions after returning from Shanghai to investigate the National Bank's sale of gold and silver and reporting on the investigation process at the Supervisory Yuan on the 23rd. Tang analyzed the origin of the National Bank's policy of selling gold and silver when reporting at the court meeting on the 23rd, saying that when Sun's cabinet was first established, it was planned to link the three parts of finance, finance, and trade into one in order to increase fiscal revenue and reduce issuance. However, for various reasons, the scheduled plan could not be achieved. The Central Bank, acting as the national treasury, paid out huge sums of money from February 1 to 28 and from March 1 to 19 pursuant to orders from the Ministry of Finance, part of which was for political expenses and another part for temporary expenses. In addition to what has already been arranged and paid out, the unpaid amount is as high as 40 billion yuan. In addition, prices are rising daily, the amount of money is insufficient, and the shortage of banknotes is becoming increasingly serious. In order to take countermeasures, the Central Bank implemented the sale of gold and silver for three purposes: (1) to regulate finance, (2) to combat speculation, (3) to ease rising prices. At that time, the amount of gold thrown out reached more than 40,000 taels. The amount of silver dollars thrown out on the 18th and 19th reached more than 330,000. The methods of selling were divided into two types: explicit distribution and secret sale. Explicit distribution was distributed to various silver shops, and secret sale was entrusted to the Bank of Communications to be sold through brokers. Although prices were stable for one or two days at that time, they then fluctuated sharply again, and the severity of the banknote shortage was not reduced at all. Later, a considerable amount of US dollars was thrown out again, which only had a few days of effect. Then Tang explained the four common views of the two after the investigation: (1) Today, military and political expenses are huge, and the phenomenon of unbalanced income and expenditure is deepening day by day. Currency inflation is also increasing. Within a month, income and expenditure often increase several times, and the situation is very serious. (2) Selling gold and silver can only be effective for three to five days. After this, prices will rise sharply again. Not only can it not stabilize prices, but it also stimulates prices. The technology of selling is highly questionable, and the national gold and silver wealth is limited. The use of limited gold and silver for speculators' speculation cannot be effective forever and should be carefully considered. The reason why such a speculative phenomenon has formed in Shanghai, Tang analyzed, is nothing more than five points: A. Everyone has no confidence in the gold yuan coupon, so they take the gold yuan coupon as much as possible to exchange for gold, silver, and US dollars, and gold, silver, and US dollars have become the object of speculation. B. Speculators in Shanghai are keen, have deep observations, and have sophisticated methods. The methods set by the government cannot escape the hands of these cunning people. C. There are too many military and political agencies in Shanghai, and military and public funds often participate in speculation. D. Banks and money shops in Shanghai collude with each other and are unified, all targeting the government and seeking profits. E. According to various signs, it is obvious that wealthy capital and special forces are causing trouble. With the above five reasons, the policy of selling gold and silver not only cannot combat speculation, but also promotes speculation, and the policy itself may also have problems. On the 38th, the price of silver dollars on the Shanghai market was more than 7,000 yuan. The Central Bank sold it at 7,000 yuan, which was not higher than the market price. However, at that time, the silver dollars in various places outside of Shanghai were mostly below 7,000 yuan. Influenced by Shanghai and the Central Bank selling at 7,000 yuan, they rose sharply and caused price fluctuations. The Central Bank cannot shirk its responsibility for negligence. People from the Central Bank have expressed that this was due to a lack of consideration. When selling, it mostly passes through the hands of brokers. They often collect it in small amounts and then sell it in large amounts. Whether wealthy families are causing trouble should be closely watched. Tang said in conclusion: The policy of selling gold and silver is not a fundamental plan, and efforts should be made from the root to improve the current economy.

### Communist Army in Anhui and Hubei Moves South Section by Section, Qianshan is Occupied and Anqing is Threatened, Garrison Troops in Xishui Also Withdraw to the Suburbs

[Our Anqing Dispatch, 23rd] According to a communique from the Ministry of National Defense today, the 6th and 7th Columns of the Communist Army have fled south from Hefei to the vicinity of Chaoxian. According to this morning's reconnaissance report from the Air Force, the 3rd Column of the Communist Army is moving south from Tongcheng, and the leading troops have reached the northeastern area of Anqing. In the past two rounds, the Communist Army from various places in northern Jiangsu and eastern Hubei has been pressing on Anhui's Communist Army from the south. The southward movement is also coordinated with the army's entire operation.

[Central News Agency Anqing Dispatch, 23rd] Anhui's Communist Army is currently harassing this area. On the night of the 21st, it occupied Qianshan and Gaohebu. The National Army is strengthening its defenses and firmly defending Anqing.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] According to a military reconnaissance report, the Communist Army in western Anhui has continued to increase its strength toward Tongcheng in recent days. There are now more than 20,000 people. Its leading troops arrived in the area 20 kilometers south of Tongcheng yesterday, and there is a possibility that it will continue to flee south and threaten Anqing. However, according to a senior military official, there are currently more than 20,000 Communist troops stationed in Tongcheng, but there are no signs of an invasion of Anqing.

[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 23rd] After a unit of the 4th Corps of the Communist Army Chen Geng arrived near Luotian, eastern Hubei, on the 21st, its main force still stayed at Tengjiabao north of Luotian, and another leading force of more than 5,000 people had crossed Luotian and arrived at Ximabai between Luotian and Guangji, with the intention of continuing to force Guangji. The original 5,000 Communist troops stationed in Macheng have moved south near Xishui. The garrison troops in Xishui have withdrawn to the suburbs of the city (only four li from Lanxi Town, north of the Yangtze River in eastern Hubei), preparing to intercept them. If the Communist army continues to press south, the National Army outside the bridgehead has already laid out an iron formation, and the war in eastern Hubei is difficult to avoid.

[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 23rd] Military news: The 4th Corps of the Communist Army Chen Geng has penetrated deep into the Dabie Mountain area into Luotian and Xishui counties in eastern Hubei. Guangji and Qichun are simultaneously tight. The National Army is actively increasing defenses at various bridgeheads from Lanxi Town (belonging to Xishui) in the east to Qichun, Tianjiazhen, Wuxue (all belonging to Guangji), and Kongdun (belonging to Huangmei) on the north bank of the Yangtze River in eastern Hubei and is controlling several important strongholds with strong forces gathered on both its east and west sides to closely monitor the area. The river defense line has been strengthened.

### Former Military Advisor to China, General Barr, Discusses Our Situation in the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee

Recommends Closely Monitoring its Development

[Central News Agency Washington Dispatch, 22nd] Former Chief of the U.S. Military Advisory Group to China, Major General Barr, attended a closed-door meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 22nd, discussing the military and political situation in China for more than two hours. It is rumored that Barr expressed pessimism about the current situation of the Chinese government. After the meeting, Committee Chairman Connally told reporters that Barr had described the entire situation of both the Nationalists and the Communists to the Committee and submitted a written report to the Committee. This report was not published. Barr did not propose any U.S. aid to China plan, but he suggested that even if the political situation in China evolves to the point that the entire country is engulfed in an iron curtain, the United States should closely monitor the development of the situation in China.

### Editorial: The Change of Foreign Minister and Foreign Policy

After the announcement of the list of cabinet members of the He Cabinet, people felt that the new cabinet, in addition to the general feeling that the talents and qualifications were slightly insufficient, could not but be said to have made considerable progress. In any case, this seems to be a new atmosphere compared to the previous two cabinets. The most eye-catching thing is the return of Ambassador Chuan Bingchang, the ambassador to the Soviet Union, to take over the position of Foreign Minister. According to general opinion, Chuan has been stationed in Moscow for five or six years, and may have a clearer understanding of the Soviet political situation and its attitude towards China. Now that he has returned to the country to take over as Foreign Minister, China's foreign policy may undergo drastic changes. Therefore, in the past few days, foreign news agencies, which have always been able to make something out of nothing, have once again spread news about Chuan's appointment as Foreign Minister, saying that China's foreign policy will abandon the Washington line and take the Moscow line, or that there has been a great division within the Kuomintang over the choice of Foreign Minister. Some telegrams even said that Fu's appointment as Foreign Minister was the result of Zhang Zhizhong and Shao Lizi's efforts to fight for it. Based on our common sense, the wide spread of these rumors raises serious doubts about how much factual basis there is, and it is not worthy of a knowing smile. The foreign policy of any country has its immovable foundation, and it will not change its course due to personnel changes. We would like to take this opportunity to review our country's foreign policy with the whole country.

For thousands of years, the Chinese people have been accustomed to self-respect and arrogance, and have always called China the world, without any modern international concept. It was not until the late Qing Dynasty, after China's doors were opened, that they realized that there were many countries in the world besides China; but they still regarded foreign countries as barbarians, unwilling to treat them as equals, unwilling to study the world situation, and even more unaware of what diplomacy was, only knowing that handling foreign affairs was a new policy. The ignorant relatives of the emperor and the vulgar ministers made China's diplomatic history full of shame and stains, making it unbearable to read. Even after the birth of the Republic of China, the vigorous May Fourth Movement made the general youth deeply aware of the importance of "people's diplomacy", but they were poisoned by the stale concept of "weak countries have no diplomacy". In the past two or thirty years, our country has not had brilliant achievements in diplomacy.

We study the truth of the matter, not because there are no diplomats in the country, but because the people who handle diplomacy are misled again and again by some wrong ideas. Let's take a well-known example: For example, the well-known "using barbarians to control barbarians". In the use of diplomacy, it is indeed one of the diplomatic means, but it must have some prerequisites when using it. If you can't stand on your own feet and vainly try to use the means of "using barbarians to control barbarians", the result will inevitably be a tragedy of "rejecting the tiger at the front door and letting the wolf in at the back door". There are many examples in China's diplomatic history. We must accept the lessons of history and have a thorough understanding. In fact, when China handles diplomacy, we believe that only the six characters of "speaking truthfully, acting sincerely" should be our treasure. To put it more succinctly, it is just "sincerity". "Sincerity is the beginning and end of things; without sincerity, there is nothing". In the world, even in ordinary daily life and social interactions, there should be no lack of "sincerity". Can it be said that means can be used between countries and that sincerity and trustworthiness can be abandoned? Or do you think that the world is changing rapidly and the wind of maneuvering is prevailing? Although China is nominally a great country, it is weak and powerless. If you talk about sincerity and trustworthiness, wouldn't you worry about being deceived? However, it is not known that only when the national strength is insufficient, should we be more determined not to change our sincerity and trustworthiness. Only sincerity can investigate things, move people, and receive the effect of getting more help. It is by no means something that those who change their minds can dream of getting unexpected gains.

Since the Anti-Japanese War, the foreign policy of the National Government has consistently adopted the principle of independence and autonomy. We are grateful for the friendship and assistance of any country; and we cannot tolerate the deliberate aggression and humiliation of any country. The United States has no territorial ambitions towards China, and its years of assistance are nothing more than hoping that China can become an independent, democratic, and strong country to maintain peace in East Asia after the war. The Chinese people are happy to accept the friendship of the United States for this reason, and there is no so-called "pro-American", let alone falling into the arms of the United States. However, some people have excessive expectations of the United States in the past, but they do not reflect on themselves. Once they feel that American aid is not as much as we hoped, they turn around and curse the United States, and even say that if the United States does not strengthen its assistance, they will turn to "pro-Soviet", which is very strange. Some foreign journalists do not realize that this is just the prejudice and fantasy of a few people, so once they see Ambassador Chuan being transferred to be the Foreign Minister, they become neurotic and speculate that this is a sign of a change in China's foreign policy. We think not.

First, it is still under consideration whether Ambassador Chuan is willing to return to the country to take over as Foreign Minister. Even if Ambassador Chuan agrees and returns to the country to take office, it cannot be said that the ambassador to the Soviet Union must be "pro-Soviet" and must take the Moscow line. Take Mr. Bohlen as an example. He is today a strong advocate of anti-Sovietism in the United States, but he once served as the Ambassador to the Soviet Union. What's more, it is questionable how many times Ambassador Chuan has met Stalin and Molotov in the Soviet Union for several years, and how the Soviet Union values him. Even if he wants to be "pro-Soviet", it is not so easy.

Second, in terms of China's current foreign policy, it still takes an independent and autonomous stand and takes the middle line. On the one hand, it welcomes US economic and military assistance, but on the other hand, it still has a 30-year Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with the Soviet Union. The friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union are no less than those between China and the United States. If it is true that China's foreign policy will take the Moscow line as rumored, but what kind of benefits will it have? This is a serious question. This kind of wavering and lack of a central idea will plunge China into a dangerous abyss.

Third, in terms of the international situation, since the content of the Atlantic Treaty was announced, the Cold War between the East and the West has become more and more intense, but it is believed that it will not turn into a hot war for a while. China is a major country in the Pacific. As the Pacific Treaty is about to be brewed, China must be cautious in our actions, always maintain our attitude of opposing totalitarian aggression, so that the world's democratic countries can strengthen their front, in order to show that the world's war fire is not allowed to be reignited by totalitarian aggressive countries, so that those who play with fire can know what to be afraid of, and a new international war may be avoided. At a time when more than 50 US senators (accounting for more than half of the total) have signed a request to strengthen aid to China, it is said that the government will instead change its course and take the Moscow line. Not to mention that the He Cabinet is not so stupid, even if the He Cabinet wants to do so, the people may not be willing to give up.

### Four Soldiers Executed by Shooting in the Case of Gang Rape of the Wife of the Regiment Commander in Hankou; Three Other Criminals Transferred to the Court for Investigation

[Our newspaper, Hankou, 23rd] The much-publicized case of the gang rape of the wife of the regiment commander by six people in Wuhan suddenly announced a partial judgment on the 23rd. The four main criminals with military status, Cui Bowen, Zeng Xuanmin, Ling Zhi, and Shi Pan, were tied to the execution ground at 5:00 pm on the 23rd and executed by shooting. The remaining accomplices, Cha Dajun, Yuan Shangzhi, and the worker Chen Songlian, who destroyed the evidence, were transferred to the court for investigation because they had no military status. Previously, after the case was tried by the military judicial organs here, it was repeatedly submitted to the Ministry of National Defense for review. Later, because the ministry returned it for retrial and sent You Xiongjun, deputy director of the Military Law Bureau, to Hankou to conduct an investigation, it was delayed for several months before entering the final decision stage. In recent days, because National Assemblywoman Zhang Renji repeatedly urged Commander-in-Chief Bai to inquire about the outcome, Bai immediately telegraphed Acting President Li, and the original judgment was approved by telegram on the 22nd and sent to the Military Law Department of the Ninth Supply District for execution by shooting. Very few people outside knew about the execution. However, according to the judgment issued by the department, which was more than a thousand words long, it was determined that the fact of the gang rape by six people was largely the same as that stated by the victim, Chen Yu. The only main corroborating evidence was that the worker Chen Songlian admitted that he saw six people carrying the woman into a small room and found a pile of liquid like snot on the floor. He was accused of destroying evidence by wiping away this pile of "snot". Overall, the judgment was indeed made with great care.

### Pacific Region Nations Could Conclude Treaty in Mid-July Commonwealth Conference Will Discuss First

[Reuters, London, 23rd] High-ranking British and American diplomatic circles here believe that countries in the Pacific region can form a collective security pact within four months to protect their territories and prevent the long-term intrusion of communism. Diplomatic circles on the western shore of the Atlantic have now begun to seriously study the work of placing the cornerstone of the Pacific Pact. This pact, along with the soon-to-be-formally-signed Atlantic Pact, will be the cornerstone of the British and American joint policy of maintaining world security and peace. It is said that the British government's decision to convene a Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in London on April 23 is primarily motivated by the Pacific Pact. The United States has reportedly indicated to Britain that the participation of the British Commonwealth is a necessary prerequisite for the Pacific Pact. Therefore, before formally convening the Pacific Pact conference, the opinions of the British Commonwealth on this matter must first be determined. External experts here predict that if the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference convened next month goes smoothly, the Pacific Pact conference is expected to be held in Washington, D.C., in the latter half of May, and the pact could become a reality by July at the latest this year. Because the Atlantic Pact can serve as a precedent for the Pacific Pact, there should not be any major difficulties in the latter's discussions. British and American officials acknowledge that the main motivation for the Pacific Pact is the deteriorating situation faced by democratic countries in Asia and the Far East. At the same time, there are signs that the Soviet Union is shifting the Cold War front from Europe to Asia. The active expansion of communist forces in China, Burma, Vietnam, and Indonesia has made resolutions regarding the Pacific a major issue. The United States has previously advocated sympathy for ethnic movements in colonies, but due to the continuous expansion of communist forces, whether the United States should still retain this traditional policy in the Far East is a difficult decision. Related parties here also predict that the countries joining the Pacific Pact can be determined to be the United States (including the trust territories in the Pacific), Britain (including its colonies in the Pacific), France, the Netherlands (both including their colonies in the Pacific), Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Finland, and Canada. Those who may be invited to participate include Siam and the Philippines. As for those who have an opportunity to join only after their domestic situation is clarified, they include China, Japan, South Korea, Burma, etc.

### After the Establishment of the Pacific Pact Colonial Movements Can Be Weakened The U.S. Has Recently Agreed to the British View

[Reuters, London, 23rd] According to British sources here, the United States has recently agreed with Britain's view that supporting colonial movements at this time would indirectly weaken the position of Western countries, which is contrary to the original intention of the Atlantic Pact. The impact of the United States' acceptance of this view on the Far East region can be summarized as follows:

In Vietnam: The war between France and the Viet Minh Nationalist Party is expected to continue for more than two years without interruption. After the realization of the Pacific Pact, France may obtain foreign aid under the pact to quell armed rebellions across the border.

In Indonesia: Although the Netherlands' military actions have temporarily gained the upper hand, the future is fraught with hidden worries. The establishment of the Pacific Pact can enable the Netherlands to obtain material and moral support.

In Burma: The Burmese government is already on the verge of collapse in the face of domestic armed rebellions and has sought aid from Britain and India. The establishment of the Pacific Pact will naturally enable the Burmese government to cope with internal unrest by borrowing foreign aid.

### Siam Eager to Join Pacific Region Alliance

[Reuters, Bangkok, 22nd] A spokesman for the Siamese cabinet stated today: Siam is eager to join any possible defense group formed by non-communist countries in the Pacific and Asian regions.

### Yoshida Trapped in Difficulties with New Budget Issues

Planning to Request MacArthur to Save Face

[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida visited Dodge, MacArthur's economic advisor, on the afternoon of the 22nd to begin political negotiations on the issue of budget preparation, and agreed to personally discuss it with MacArthur again in a day or two. According to Yoshida, he intends to ask MacArthur to save face for the ruling Liberal Party by at least retaining the following three promises: (1) canceling the transaction tax; (2) not reducing public utility fees; and (3) not increasing passenger transportation fees. Otherwise, the Liberal Party will be in an unfavorable position in the Diet, and there is also a risk of internal division. However, according to well-informed sources close to MacArthur's headquarters, "MacArthur's intention is very firm, and it is unlikely that Yoshida will be able to shake his major principle that the budget must be balanced."

### House Foreign Affairs Committee Approves U.S. Aid to Europe Allocations Reduced by US$200 Million

### The Soviet Union Accuses the United States of Establishing Bases in Iran Acheson Denies It as Absurd But Declares Deep Concern About the Situation in the Middle East

[This newspaper's dispatch] Washington, 3rd Broadcasting: Acheson dismissed as completely absurd the Soviet Union's accusation that the United States is establishing military bases in Iran in preparation for an attack on the Soviet Union. Acheson also stated at a press conference today that the United States' concern for the North Atlantic region should not be misunderstood as a reduction in the United States' attention to Greece, Turkey, and the countries of the Near East and Middle East. Acheson said that there are currently 62 American officers and soldiers in Iran. Their mission is only to advise on matters such as the organization and replenishment of the Iranian army and to assist Iran in establishing appropriate international security forces. Acheson said that in recent weeks, the pressure on Iran from Soviet newspapers and radio broadcasts has obviously increased. The Soviet side often claims that the U.S. military obviously intends to make Iran a military base for attacking the Soviet Union, but such accusations are purely absurd.

At the same time, New York Governor Dewey has accused the conference of being hosted by the Communist front. A State Department spokesman said: Even if no more passports are issued to other participants, the twenty-one representatives who have already obtained passports and come here from the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Romania, and other countries are enough to show that this event belongs to the Communist side.

### Headless Dismemberment Case: Important Clues Discovered; Substantial Reward for Information on Woman who Disposed of Package in River; Hairy, Yellowish, Large Feet, Robust Build; Victim Possibly Not a National; Meticulous Care by Murderer in Removing Fingerprints

[Our Dispatch] The headless dismemberment case discovered on Jinyi Road has now entered its third day. Thanks to the diligent investigation of all parties, significant progress has been made in the main leads of the case.

The case is the primary focus of attention for police investigators. Where did the body come from? According to a preliminary investigation, Zhang Wenneng, a secretary at the local Baojia (neighborhood watch) office, believes that this could not have been the work of rural farmers. He deduced that the body was transported from the city to Jinyi Road, possibly via Hengshan Road, Wanping Road, or Linsen Road. However, after investigators departed from Wanping Road, passed the Xujiahui Station, the "Luke Clinic" on Puxi Road, and returned along the Xujiahui Road riverbank, passing Tianyao Bridge, Jinyi Bridge, and Fenglin Bridge, paying attention to whether there were any traces of blood along the riverbank or whether any used goods stalls had sold oilcloth, women's jackets, cotton batting, or travel bags, the result was negative.

The police have a hypothesis that if the dismemberment of the body was not done within the city, then it must have been completed not far from Shanghai. There are two pieces of evidence to support this hypothesis: first, the striped cloth used to wrap the body is not a product of this city, but may have been produced in nearby areas with small-scale textile industries; second, the forensic examination determined that the time from when the victim was killed to when the body was moved did not exceed forty-eight hours. Currently, the police are preparing a transportation chart centered on Shanghai, including airplanes, ships, trains, and automobiles, to identify locations that can be reached within the above time limit, and then study the most likely locations to conduct focused investigations. At the same time, they are notifying local police, drivers, passengers, and rickshaw drivers to recall whether anyone carried a package similar to the one in this case a few days ago, and to report or confidentially inform the police as much as possible.

This reward for confidential information has yielded a major breakthrough as of yesterday. According to reliable sources, at 8:00 AM on the 22nd, on the Baotai Ferry from Puxi to Yangjiadu in Pudong, a woman suddenly threw a heavy package into the river, and her expression was extremely panicked. The woman was about forty years old, dressed in short shirt and pants, looking like a rural farmer. The only distinguishing feature was that her left eye was a snail-shell eye. Currently, this person is unknown and cannot be questioned, but it is believed that she may have an important connection to this case. The police have stated that they will spare no expense and hope that someone can provide various clues about the case, including the whereabouts of this woman.

The results of the third examination of the body by the police forensic doctor determined that the cartilage in the victim's throat had hardened, so it was inferred that the victim should be about forty years old. Furthermore, there were signs of trauma in the victim's throat before being killed, which may have been the cause of death. Secondly, the victim's pubic hair and armpit hair were yellowish-white. The neck muscles were thick, the feet were especially large, and the muscles were firm. The victim's nutrition appeared to be very good before death. All of this suggests that the victim may not be a national. Today, the police will re-examine the leg hair to confirm. According to Branch Director Cheng Yikuan, human hair from head to toe must be of the same type and color. If the victim's head were still present, it would be of great help in the investigation. However, the murderer discarded the head before moving the body, which proves that the murderer was already concerned that the victim's hair could be used for investigation. Furthermore, considering that the fingers and toes of the body were all cut off (leaving only one thumb, but the fingerprint was also removed), it is even more evident that the murderer deeply understands the importance of the victim's fingerprints falling into the hands of the police. The murderer is definitely a complete "insider" and must have in-depth knowledge of anatomy, without a doubt.

The work of household registration and record-keeping in our country has not yet been fully perfected, which is the greatest regret when investigating criminal cases. There is a body abandoned on Jinyi Road, so there must be a person missing from the population somewhere, but since the occurrence of the case, no missing person reports have been received. The police have now decided to issue a public announcement to inquire whether any sudden disappearances have been discovered recently in various places, or whether any abandoned human internal organs, fingers, toes, and heads have been found anywhere, so as to gain a deeper understanding of the case. According to the police, they initially suspected whether the body might have been discarded by a medical institution after an autopsy. However, after inquiring, it was learned that autopsy practices never involve cutting off the head or removing fingers and toes, and there is certainly no need to dismember it into dozens of pieces.

In addition, yesterday, police officer Zhang Huiyu of the Changshu Road Branch mentioned after investigating the case that he had heard Branch Chief Zhang Zhen of the Longhua Branch casually mention that on the 29th at midnight, he was walking from the branch back to his residence at Jinyi Bridge on Xiexu Road. When passing in front of the Shandong Guild Hall, he heard noisy sounds of shouting and even beatings inside the hall. Zhang was suspicious and went to the Shandong Guild Hall to investigate. He learned that there were fifty to sixty refugees living there. According to the person in charge, Zhang Zihe, they usually behave themselves and denied that there had been any quarrels on the 19th night. Later, Zhang secretly visited various villages near the guild hall and made a detailed record for reference.

[Another Dispatch] In the case of the dismembered body on Jinyi Road, female prosecutor Wang Youqin of the District Procuratorate went to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall with a forensic doctor for examination. She is currently drafting a report and has begun the investigation.

### North-South Navigation Issue; Navigation Industry Nominates Six Representatives; Going to Capital to Report and Seek Instructions

[Our Dispatch] Regarding the issue of north-south navigation, since the four representatives of the Shanghai navigation industry returned from North China, various navigation organizations and private shipping companies have been constantly in contact, carefully discussing the navigation plan and details proposed by the CCP in order to summarize the opinions of the entire industry and provide them to the government for reference.

### Public Utility Prices to Rise by 70% Starting Today; Assumed Index is 2,350 Times

[Our Dispatch] Starting today, the prices of various public utilities in this city will be adjusted according to the estimated index, in accordance with the methods approved by the previous Council. According to news from various public utility companies and public transportation companies, the new prices for public utilities will be based on the base price multiplied by an assumed index of 2,350 times, which is about 70% higher than the original price. The new prices for trams, buses, and other items are being calculated overnight by various companies and will be implemented starting today. Public transportation prices can be maintained until the 8th of next month. The prices of water, electricity, gas, and telephone will be re-priced on the 1st of next month according to the next period's cost of living index for employees, with refunds or supplements for any differences.

[Another Dispatch] After the new prices of public utilities such as water, electricity, and gas are automatically adjusted according to the base number, there does not seem to be a significant saving in general consumption. The supply figures of the power company, water company, and gas company cannot be accurately compared because they need to be settled after the end of the month. However, according to the persons in charge of each company, the figures are generally the same as before. For example, the daily power generation of the Shanghai Electric Power Company is still above 3 million, and the supply of industrial electricity has not increased much compared to before.

### Premier He Earnestly Retains; Mayor Wu's Intention to Resign Remains Unchanged; Will Travel to Hangzhou with Wife in Early Next Month

[Our Dispatch] The reporter visited Mayor Wu yesterday to inquire whether, after Premier He of the new cabinet earnestly retained him, the mayor's intention to resign could be dispelled. The mayor replied that he had not received the order. As for changing the resignation to a vacation, he thought it was not very appropriate. Because the environment in Shanghai is complex and difficult, problems cannot be solved without exerting all efforts. Therefore, it is very difficult for others to replace him. Moreover, it is difficult to predict whether he will recover his health after two months of vacation. Therefore, he will still firmly request his resignation. As for the report that the mayor's wife has already moved to Taiwan, the mayor strongly denied it, saying that his wife is living peacefully in Shanghai. Starting in early next month, he will get rid of everything and travel to Hangzhou with his wife to enjoy the spring. He firmly believes that the beautiful scenery will greatly benefit his health.

Yesterday, more than 30 city councilors, including Tang Shichang, unanimously signed a petition to retain Mayor Wu and the bureau chiefs, asking them to dismiss their intention to resign.

### Train Car Corpse Case; Deadline of Half a Month to Solve; Concrete Clues Obtained After 24 Days

[Our Dispatch] The train car corpse case was discovered at the North Station at the beginning of this month and has been going on for 24 days. In these 24 days, although the police departments of the two railways have worked hard to investigate, there are still no concrete clues. Qian He, the director of the police department, believed that the case was of great importance and must be solved quickly. Therefore, he issued a hand order to the police officers handling the case yesterday, setting a deadline of half a month to solve the case.

A certain film production company in this city is very interested in the box corpse case and believes that if the tortuous and bizarre details of the case can be slightly embellished and compiled into a terrifying and suspenseful detective story and made into a film, it will definitely be a sensation, and the business is absolutely guaranteed. The company specially sent personnel to visit the relevant departments of the two railway bureaus yesterday to make contact.

Also, the plainclothes police officers handling the box corpse case have been working extremely hard in recent days. As for the section in the Suzhou telegram in this newspaper a few days ago that an official from a certain agency in Jiangyin seemed to recognize the deceased, the railway police authorities are also paying close attention to it, but said that the letter from Jiangyin has not yet been received. If someone recognizes the deceased and can find their family, then solving the case is just around the corner.

### Continuing Influx of Refugee Students to Shanghai: Disappointment Expressed Due to Lack of Assistance; Absence of Freedom in Beiping and Tianjin Main Reason for Departure

[Our Dispatch] In recent days, there has been a continuous stream of students from North China fleeing to Shanghai. Yesterday, the "Jing Yu" and "Li Tai" ships arrived from Qingdao, carrying more than two hundred and fifty middle school and university students. They are experiencing difficult living conditions, with many lacking adequate food and clothing. Their journey to Shanghai was facilitated by the Qingdao Municipal Government Temporary Relief Committee, which arranged free passage for them. After arriving yesterday morning, they immediately went to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Education Bureau with their luggage, seeking solutions to their food, lodging, and onward transportation problems to the south. Following discussions between the two bureaus, aside from those who had relatives or friends in Shanghai or were able to stay in hostels through their own means, the rest were sent to the Third Reception Center of the Caohejing Municipal Relief Association for temporary accommodation. Meanwhile, the Social Affairs Bureau and the Education Bureau contacted the Railway Bureau to arrange train tickets to Hangzhou, with the necessary train fares being provided by the Municipal Relief Association. After going to Hangzhou, they will contact the Youth Re-enrollment and Employment Assistance Committee of the Ministry of Education to discuss educational opportunities. There is news that the Ministry of Education is planning to establish Southeast University in Fujian Province, to which they are all pinning fervent hopes.

These more than two hundred and fifty male and female students belong to schools such as Peking University, Normal University, Chaoyang University, Northeastern University, Changchun University, Changbai Normal School, Northeast Provisional Middle School, and Northeast Zhongshan Middle School. They successively left Jinan from Beiping and Tianjin before and after the Communist Party of China (CPC) occupied Beiping, and then went to Qingdao via Weixian. The most recent group left Beiping at the beginning of this month. According to them, after the CPC entered Beiping, in addition to the original schools, three new universities were established. Among them, the Military and Political University is a place for training military cadres, with Ye Jianying as the president. The predecessor of North China University was the Anti-Japanese University, with Wu Yuzhang as the president, and its purpose is to train political cadres. In addition, the North China People's Revolutionary University is located in the western suburbs. The entry level of the school ranges from elementary school to university, and there are now more than 10,000 students. The curriculum includes political common sense and revolutionary thought, etc. After graduation from training, they will go to work in the countryside.

One in Ten Students from Beiping, Tianjin, and the Northeast Flees

As for the major universities and middle schools in the Northeast that had moved to Beiping and Tianjin, the CPC relocated the schools back to Changchun, Harbin, and Shenyang on February 28. There are more than 10,000 students from the Northeast in Beiping and Tianjin, and about one-tenth of them have fled south. They believe that there is no freedom of life in Beiping under the control of the CPC, so they choose to go south despite the difficulties and dangers. However, after arriving in Shanghai, they are quite disappointed due to the lack of government assistance. It is said that there are still students from various schools in North China who want to go south, and they urgently hope that the government can take more responsibility and provide more care for this matter.

The Municipal Education Bureau Declares That It Is Not Handling Registration on Behalf

[Our Dispatch] The Municipal Education Bureau, in response to a news report yesterday that the Education Bureau was handling the registration of refugee students from North China on its behalf, specifically declared: "The Ministry of Education has not entrusted the bureau to handle the registration of refugee students. However, the Youth Re-enrollment and Employment Assistance Committee of the Ministry of Education dispatched Mr. Yu Xiaoci from Hangzhou on the 16th of this month, carrying a temporary relief fund of 2 million yuan, to Shanghai to prepare for the registration and relocation of refugee students. As a result of consultations between Mr. Yu and the Education Bureau, the work of providing relief to refugee students is extremely heavy and must be handled by a dedicated institution established by the Ministry of Education in Shanghai, and there must be a fixed budget to be effective. Mr. Yu immediately returned to Hangzhou with the relief fund of 2 million yuan that evening to ask for instructions, and has not yet come to Shanghai."

University and College Petitioning Students Set Off for Nanjing Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] The ten student representatives of the Shanghai Municipal National University and College Association for Survival who are petitioning in Nanjing set off yesterday. They include one representative each from Jiaotong University, Fudan University, Tongji University, Jinan University, Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai Business College, Conservatory of Music, Preschool Teachers College, Tangshan College, and Wusong Merchant Marine College, as well as four student representatives from Nanjing and one representative from Hangzhou. Their demands are fourfold: (1) full public funding; (2) adjustment of salaries for faculty and staff according to the price index; (3) increased regular funding for schools; (4) provision of professional development funds for staff.

[Another Dispatch] The Association of Universities and Colleges in the Nanjing Area to Fight for Public Funding has been established, indicating that they will take unified action with the students in Shanghai.

Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff Request Three Points from the Mayor

[Our Dispatch] Representatives Xi Zhenyong, Zhang Zhihua, and Gu He from the Municipal Middle School Teachers and Staff Friendship Association, and representatives Li Zhanren, Huang Shiping, and Xu Yuchang from the Municipal Primary School Teachers and Staff Friendship Association, visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government at 10:00 am yesterday, and asked the mayor to withdraw his resignation, and made three requests. The mayor said that his resignation was due to physical exhaustion. As for the requests made, he replied to each one as follows: (1) Requesting the issuance of 1,000 times the salary before the 25th of this month. The mayor informed that at least another 450 times can be issued before the end of the month, and if there is a way to raise funds, it can be increased. After the central government announces the public and educational index for each region, Shanghai can issue the full amount. The representatives hoped that the amount promised by the mayor would be issued before the 28th or 29th. (2) Requesting the maintenance of in-kind rations and the issuance of overdue edible oil and coal briquettes. The mayor agreed to urge the competent authorities. The request to continue monthly distribution in the future will be submitted to the central government. (3) Requesting an increase in welfare rice to respond to the grain storage movement. The mayor stated that two dou of rice per person will continue to be distributed monthly. In addition, the mayor advised that the Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff Friendship Association should postpone sending representatives to Nanjing for various petitions. The mayor believes that the cabinet has just been completed, and the measures for public and educational treatment have not yet been determined, so we can wait for the announcement before determining the attitude.

The Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff Friendship Association will hold a joint meeting again at Yucai Middle School at 4:00 pm today.

### Habitual Thieves on Two Railway Lines Do Not Change Their Ways; Commit Crimes Again After Being Released from Prison

[Our Dispatch] Habitual thief Xiao Xizi, one of the "Five Tiger Generals" who ran rampant on the two railway lines, had been arrested with his accomplices Hangzhou, Wang Asi, Guan Afeng (female), and Changjiao Ganbin for theft in May, December of the 35th year, and June of the 36th year, and was sentenced to six months in prison by the District Court. Unexpectedly, after the criminals were released from prison, they used the alias Yang Zhengyuan, and took their accomplice Zhang Binghua (nicknamed Xiao Tailor), to resume their career as thieves. A few days ago, the two thieves were wandering on Platform 1 of the North Railway Station, waiting for an opportunity to steal. They were spotted by the railway police, who noticed that their actions were suspicious. They stepped forward to inquire whether they had train tickets. The two criminals were afraid and tried to escape, so they were detained. After being sent to the police section for questioning, they confessed that they often committed theft with their accomplices in various stations and trains on the two railway lines. On the 3rd of this month, they stole 250,000 yuan of huge amount of money in gold yuan at the North Railway Station, and stole 135,000 yuan on the train to Hangzhou.

### Housing Dispute Resolved; Wang Hanlun Will Go to the Countryside

[Our Dispatch] Since this newspaper revealed that Wang Hanlun, a veteran movie star from twenty years ago, was impoverished and her residence was forced to move, it has attracted attention from all sectors of society. Yesterday, the Land Administration Bureau summoned the landlord Zhou Xiangsheng and the tenant Wang Hanlun to mediate. After persuasion by the person in charge of the Land Administration Bureau, Zhou agreed to move out of the kiosk of the Xiangsheng Apartment within half a month. The bureau also believed that Wang's situation was pitiful and agreed to give her six taels of gold as her moving expenses. Both parties established a record in the Land Administration Bureau, and this housing dispute came to an end. It is reported that Wang, because of her old age and faded beauty, has no confidence in returning to the stage or silver screen, and after receiving the moving expenses, she will move to the countryside to spend her twilight years.

### "Air Palace" Has a Very High Speed; China National Aviation Corporation's New Aircraft Will Arrive in Hong Kong at the End of the Month; Shanghai Flight Will Only Take Two Hours

[Our Dispatch] China National Aviation Corporation ordered six Convair passenger planes in the United States after the war. Two of them have already been delivered and will fly from the United States to Hong Kong at the end of this month. This Convair aircraft is one of the world's newest passenger aircraft. It is said that its performance is even better than the "Sky Master" aircraft, especially its speed is very high, it can fly more than 300 miles per hour, which is unmatched by other aircraft. Its internal equipment is similar to the "Sky Master" aircraft. The cabin is full of sofa seats, the temperature and air pressure are automatically adjusted, and the engine sound is completely isolated, so passengers will not have the uncomfortable feeling of high-altitude flight such as ear pain, vomiting, and palpitations. The aircraft has two engines with great horsepower, which is equivalent to the four engines of the "Room Master" aircraft. The disadvantage is that it cannot withstand long-distance flights, so this time it flies from the United States to Hong Kong, it cannot take the shortcut across the Pacific Ocean, but detour through Europe and Africa, because there are more intermediate stops where it can land and refuel. In addition, this type of passenger aircraft is particularly luxurious and requires good airports. In addition to Hong Kong, the only domestic airports that can be used at present are Shanghai and Beiping. In the future, if Beiping can be opened to traffic, the company will fly the Hong Kong-Shanghai-Beiping line with this type of aircraft. It will take only two hours to reach Shanghai from Hong Kong, and the round trip to Hong Kong and Beiping can be made on the same day. It is heard that the company authorities may name this type of aircraft the "Air Palace."

### Investigation of Hongxing Factory's Tax Evasion; Accused of Corruption and Embezzlement; Direct Tax Bureau Supervisor Wu Zhi; Case Sent Back for Retrial After Conviction

[Our Dispatch] Xu Daofu, a professor at Zhejiang University (formerly an employee of the Hongxing Yarn Factory), previously reported that Wu Zhi, supervisor of the Municipal Direct Tax Bureau, was corrupt and embezzled when he was ordered to investigate the Hongxing Yarn Factory's tax evasion. The District Court originally sentenced the defendant to three years and six months in prison. It is now learned that the High Court sent it back to the District Court for retrial based on the following three points: (1) The defendant's report to the bureau criticized the Hongxing Yarn Factory for tax evasion and did not protect the factory; (2) The Hongxing property details list has been taken back by Xu Daofu, with two of Xu's business cards as proof; (3) It cannot be confirmed about the Weida printing shop that was the location of bribery. Yesterday, District Court Judge Wang Kanghou summoned the defendant and relevant person Xu Wende, and witnesses Zhou Huikang, the tea waiter of the Oriental Hotel, and Zhang Yuliang, the tea waiter of the Weida Hotel, for questioning. Because there were other witnesses who were not present, after a brief interrogation, the court ordered a retrial at a later date.

### Embezzlement of Grain Depot Unpolished Rice Case; Boatman Chen Jinrong Sentenced

[Our Dispatch] Chen Jinrong, the boatman who embezzled 170 bags of unpolished rice from the Shanghai General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food, was sentenced to three months in prison by Judge Chen Shijing of the District Court for the crime of embezzlement. Because the defendant heard that the General Warehouse had purchased 563 bags of unpolished rice in Suzhou, through the introduction of Song Zuomei and Xia Yuanqing, Chen transported it to Shanghai for delivery to the Ministry. The shipment started on December 25th of the old lunar calendar last year and arrived in Shanghai on January 4th. Unexpectedly, Chen embezzled as many as 170 bags in the middle, falsely claiming that he encountered wind and collided with buoys in Zhoujiadu, Huangpu River, and some rice bags fell into the water, and some were automatically thrown into the river. After investigation, there were discrepancies, so the Water Police Branch detained Chen. After the District Court summoned relevant witnesses for interrogation, the defendant's embezzlement was confirmed and the judgment was made as above.

### Call for Help in Sipailou; Fishmonger Injured in Robbery on Liming Road

[Our Dispatch] Fishmonger Yuan Jinhai, 47 years old, from Nantong, lives at No. 38, Zhengxing Lane, Linyin Road, Ximen. Yesterday morning at about 5:00 am, he went to the 16th Pier with five or six companions to purchase fish. When passing near the Qiu Tianbao Silver Shop in Sipailou in the city, four thieves suddenly emerged from the darkness, claiming to be policemen, and ordered them to stop with guns. They searched the fishmongers' pockets and found more than 100,000 yuan in funds. Just as they were about to turn around and flee, Yuan, because all his funds of 26,000 yuan were robbed and he could not make a living, stepped forward and knelt down begging for the return of the funds. The thieves saw that he was chattering endlessly, fearing that he would ruin their plan, so they drew their guns and fired a shot, hitting his right arm on the spot. The thieves scattered and fled. Shortly after, the police officer No. 7846 from the Yimiao Police Branch heard the sound and rushed to the scene. In addition to sending Yuan Jinhai to Renji Hospital for treatment, he immediately reported to the branch for pursuit.

### Yongxing Ship Sets Sail North Today; Carrying a Large Batch of Flour and Mail

### Third and Fourth Class Train Tickets Are Difficult to Buy; Regulations Limit Each Person to Two Tickets

[Our Dispatch] After repeated adjustments to the passenger tickets for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, there are not as many first and second class passengers as in the past, but the number of third and fourth class passengers has suddenly increased. The original ticket windows in the third and fourth class waiting rooms could no longer cope, so "scalpers" took the opportunity to move around, resulting in legitimate passengers queuing for days without being able to buy tickets. The North Shanghai General Station specifically stipulated yesterday that each passenger is limited to purchasing two third and fourth class tickets, and employees and police of this railway are strictly prohibited from purchasing tickets on behalf of passengers. If passengers see railway employees or police purchasing tickets on behalf of passengers, they can report to the General Station.

### Under the Pretext of Selling Counterfeit Cigarettes; Peddlers Extorted and Sentenced

[Our Dispatch] Peddlers Ji Chonghuan, Li Biao, and tailor Dai Jiaren, purchased several cartons of Three Gun cigarettes from Wang Dingfa on January 27 this year. Afterwards, Ji and others pointed out that they were counterfeit. On the afternoon of February 1, they invited several soldiers of unknown names to Wang Dingfa's home on Xingjia Road to reason with him. Wang happened to be out, so Wang's wife received them. Ji and others took the opportunity to sell fake cigarettes and planned to detain Wang and send him to the team headquarters for detention, threatening to extort 10,000 yuan to settle the matter. Wang's wife sold her gold ring and white rice and paid the money. Afterwards, Wang sued the police station and transferred it to the District Prosecutor's Office for prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Guo Zugan of the District Court sentenced the three defendants to ten months in prison for extortion and fraud.

### The Isolated City of Northern Jiangsu: Yizheng

— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper: Ling Songshou

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang to this Newspaper, 19th] On the afternoon of the 16th, this reporter, along with several colleagues from Zhenjiang, accepted the invitation of Zuo Zhiren, the Magistrate of Yizheng County, and boarded a special boat to inspect the last remaining county seat east of the Jinpu Railway and north of the Yangtze River.

After the north and south banks were blockaded, the Yangtze River's desolation defies description. The waves still surge endlessly eastward, but it's now rare to see a single boat on the river. The sky is filled with grey clouds, threatening rain. The images of sails rising and falling in the past only serve to cast the shadows of memory into the abyss of reality.

Riding into Yizheng

At dusk, we arrived at Siyuan Canal, where a warship named "Liansheng" was anchored. Siyuan Canal is four li away from Yizheng City. Along this four-li stretch of highway and on both sides, semi-permanent bridgehead fortifications have already been built. Yizheng City lies beyond these fortifications. Magistrate Zuo Zhiren told us that this road is the only retreat route Yizheng City has to the south, and the Liansheng warship will be Yizheng City's only reliable support. A misty rain had already begun to fall. He mounted his horse, and with the clip-clop of hooves, accompanied us northward towards Yizheng City. Magistrate Zuo and Chen Ce'an, the commander of the county's First Security Regiment, greeted us outside the city. We met in the dim twilight and walked into the city.

Yizheng's city walls are so low that even city defense fortifications seem unusable. On the streets, we could vaguely see barricades for street fighting built from bricks. Beside these barricades, or at intersections, stood public checkpoints, manned by people in long robes, holding wooden sticks, shouting "Halt!" with great spirit. Some of the common people were secretly peeking at us from their doorways. One wonders what expectations they, living in this isolated city, have for us Western-suited guests of the magistrate?

A History of Rise and Fall of the Isolated City

Yizheng has a century of rise and fall in its history. Over eighty jewelry stores, seventy-two pawnshops – this shadow of prosperity was burned away by the flames of the Red Turban Rebellion. However, the Twelve-Wharf Town in the southeast of the city remained a distribution center for Huai salt until before the war, with a population of over 130,000. Unfortunately, after the Grand Canal changed its course to enter the river at Guazhou, the section of the canal from Yangzhou to Twelve-Wharf became silted up and impassable, only navigable by small wooden boats. Twelve-Wharf's status plummeted, and coupled with the destruction during the War of Resistance, Twelve-Wharf became desolate, and Yizheng became even more desolate. Today, most of the foreign-style houses and mansions in Twelve-Wharf have been torn down, becoming an important bridgehead position. As for Yizheng, an isolated city, stranded on the riverbank, the urban population has dwindled to just over 4,300 people. Looking at the desolate long street within the city and the ruins and rubble everywhere, it's truly disheartening, realizing that the dream of prosperity is becoming increasingly distant and vague for Yizheng!

With the shift in the government's overall political and strategic plans, almost all of the Northern Jiangsu region was abandoned. Yangzhou, Taizhou, and Tongzhou were evacuated one after another. But Yizheng, this isolated city on the riverbank, was left behind. This is something that the local Communist cadres find unbelievable. In late January, after the Nationalist troops retreated from Luhe, Tianchang, Yangzhou, and Taixian, Yizheng began its fate of facing the river on one side and being surrounded by enemies on three sides. Around the Lunar New Year, the 208th and 203rd detachments of the local Communists, as well as units of the Southeast Detachment, all attacked the city in succession. The Communist soldiers reached the edge of the city, shouting to the defenders outside the north gate, "Come over here and celebrate the New Year! We have cured meat, salted chicken, and Qianmen brand cigarettes!" With the cooperation of the county security regiment and the stationed troops, Yizheng stood firm. Magistrate Zuo Zhiren and the other military and political officials hadn't slept well for eight nights. At this time, the county government was left with only the magistrate, a section chief, and Gao Chonghua, the chief of the police bureau.

The Tense Current Situation

Although the Communist offensive has temporarily stopped, the situation in the isolated city becomes more tense with each passing day. The territory of Yizheng County, which was originally not large, now only has the Twelve-Wharf and the city area, and these aren't even fully intact. The production areas are not under control, and military and civilian food supplies are a problem. The county government originally had one security regiment, and recently another one was established. The security regiments' provisions are, as usual, the responsibility of the local area. The county government has two sources of income, the main one being the land tax. Before the war, Yizheng's land tax often fell short of 70%. Normally, 60% of the daily expenses relied on Twelve-Wharf. Last month, the common people couldn't even collect their rent grain, so naturally, the land tax was out of the question. In addition, there were revenues from autonomous taxes and levies, including house tax, entertainment tax, feast tax, business tax, and slaughter tax. According to the statistics for the past month, the monthly income was less than 400,000 yuan. 400,000 yuan is naturally a paltry sum, but looking at how dilapidated Yizheng City is, not only do I think that levying taxes on the people is a cruel act, but the magistrate also agrees. In this situation, just considering the monthly grain ration of over 2,000 dan of rice needed by the security regiments, naturally, besides requesting assistance from the provincial government south of the Yangtze, they can only go to the Communist-controlled areas to seize their public grain! The Yizheng County government employees haven't been paid their February salaries yet, and the soldiers of the security regiment haven't been paid their salaries from January until now. After the Yangtze River was blockaded, the outside county government employees and Baojia chiefs have all run away. Luckily, Magistrate Zuo Zhiren is a veteran officer, and he still has a group of friends who are surplus officers who can be pulled over to suffer with him.

Within three hours of this reporter's arrival in Yizheng, what I saw and heard was just such a bleak and difficult outline. Under the protection of four or five light and heavy machine guns, and with the faint light of a flashlight, we attended the county government's "banquet." Afterwards, the magistrate accompanied us along the dark and muddy streets, sending us to the hotel to rest.

It was a night of slanting wind and fine rain, a night of chilling spring cold. In the isolated lamp of the lodging, the barking of dogs in the desolate city surrounded us with a sense of bleakness and silence. I took off my coat, crawled into a cold and greasy thin quilt, and fell asleep fully clothed. In the sound of the raindrops, I seemed to faintly hear sporadic gunfire coming from the north in the middle of the night. People here all say, "Gunfire is an embellishment in daily life." Naturally, I wasn't surprised.

Wax Temple Position

The next morning, Commander Chen Ce'an accompanied us to inspect the stronghold five li outside the north gate of the city—the Wax Temple. A month ago, this road outside the north gate was still an unsafe area. Only after Chairman Ding Zhi-pan came to Yizheng to inspect and instructed that the Wax Temple stronghold should be controlled did this road become passable.

The Wax Temple is located on an earthen mound, and together with the North Mountain Temple to its east, it serves as a defensive screen for the north of Yizheng City. From the bunkers, we looked far into the distance and spotted a column of Communist soldiers operating in a pine forest three or four li away. Bang! Bang! Gunshots rang out, firing several shots at the target. The sentries in front also responded by firing a few shots at the stronghold. I smelled a strong gunpowder scent. Both the Wax Temple and the North Mountain Temple are large temples. Now the temples have been torn down, and only an old tree stands tall, still able to evoke a sense of desolation. The area near the earthen mound used to be a maple forest, known as "Red Leaves of North Mountain" in the Eight Scenic Spots of Yizheng. Now, only winding trenches and rows of bunkers remain, waiting for unfortunate blood to paint a red hue on this unfortunate land! I looked south into the distance. The Yangtze River was like silk, and the mountains of the south were faintly visible between the silk threads. The pagoda of Tianning Temple in Yizheng City was also clearly visible. This temple was where Sun Chuanfang, the commander-in-chief of the Five-Province Allied Army, had his headquarters when he led his troops across the Yangtze River. Today, the talk of "crossing the river" resounds throughout the north and south of the Yangtze. Without having to delve into distant history, just the changes in the past thirty years are enough to fill one with emotion!

Returning to Zhenjiang

On the way back to the city, this reporter saw the streets more clearly. Since the north and south banks of the Yangtze River were blockaded, it's difficult to transport goods from the south. Although the number of consumers is limited, general prices are already about five times higher than in Zhenjiang. Along the main street between the north and south gates, shops occupy less than one-tenth or two-tenths of the space. The north of the city seems to be a "market" area, with many vendors. Rice sells for 20,000 yuan per dan, which is cheaper than in the south, but the only source of food for the people is now to smuggle it in from the Communist areas. Those who could leave Yizheng have already left. Those who stayed are either unwilling or unable to leave. They seem very unconcerned about the development of the situation. In reality, being in a besieged city, they can't care even if they want to.

On the afternoon of the 17th, this reporter boarded a boat back to Zhenjiang again. The dock was in a mess. This one was the wife of a military officer, and that one was a relative of someone else. Everyone was scrambling to board the boat to go south. This seemed like a mockery of the blockade of the Yangtze River! Everyone seemed to have no attachment to Yizheng. Let the development of the situation verify the future fate of Yizheng.

### Hail in Suzhou

[Dispatch from Suzhou to this Newspaper, 22nd] After days of continuous rain and lingering cold, hail suddenly fell at 6 PM on the 21st, lasting about an hour. The hail was the size of soybeans. At 8 AM on the 22nd, sleet fell again, lasting about twenty minutes.

### Changzhou: A Duet of Farming and Weaving in the City and Countryside

— Reporter for this Newspaper: Li Tianxing

[Dispatch from Wujin to this Newspaper, 21st] The people of Changzhou excel nationwide in two things: (1) The county has over 2,000 elementary schools and over 50 public and private middle schools. The number of educational institutions exceeds the total number in remote provinces such as Gansu and Guizhou, ranking first among all counties in the country. (2) Cloth production: before 1937, the county used over 160,000 bales of yarn annually, with daily sales of 500 bales. The county had over 20,000 looms, producing over 20,000-30,000 bolts of cloth daily. This number is not small. At that time, the price of cotton cloth in Shanghai was dictated by Changzhou.—This is a page of glorious history from the past. The trials of the eight-year War of Resistance and the gloom of the three-year civil war have made progress increasingly difficult. Industry and commerce as a whole are trapped in a precarious situation. But even in its current state of decline, Changzhou still retains the characteristics of the old gentry. It still has some assets and a deep and strong foundation, facing the arrival of the new era head-on.

Changzhou's textile industry has a bright future because of the human-made environment that has been brewing and developing for decades, and the textile and dyeing industries have a duet of both urban and rural elements.

The Twin Stars of Textile: Dacheng and Minfeng

The largest textile factories in the urban area, and the twin stars of Changzhou's textile industry, are the Dacheng Factory and the Minfeng Factory. Dacheng has three factories in Changzhou. The first factory is the main factory, located outside the South Gate. Before the War of Resistance, it had 20,500 spindles and 4,800 thread spindles. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, it endured hardships and struggled to survive. After the victory, it recovered from the ruins and underwent extensive repairs. It now has 29,700 spindles. The thread spindles have been moved to the third factory for spinning. Currently, it produces 74-75 bales of cotton yarn per day. The yarn spun is 42-count, 32-count, 22-count, 20-count, and also low-grade 10-count. Except for the low-grade 10-count and a portion of the 20-count, which are sold as yarn, the rest are used for weaving in the cloth factory. The weaving department had 756 looms before the war. During the War of Resistance, the looms and factory buildings were completely destroyed in military incidents. In the year of victory, reconstruction efforts were undertaken on the ruins. Steel frames and cement, cement and steel frames, workers and materials were brought together. After more than a year, 540 newly built looms began to operate again at the end of 1947. From April 1948, they gradually increased, and by August, they had returned to the old number of 756. This shows how difficult the recovery was. Now, they produce cloth day and night, with 720 bolts of one-two-pound fine cloth and 540 bolts of Shantung silk fabric per day. The fine cloth is trademarked "Butterfly Ball" and is shipped to Shanghai for transshipment to Hong Kong and Guangdong. The Shantung silk fabric is supplied to the second factory for dyeing and finishing. The second factory is located outside the East Gate and is divided into finishing, bleaching, and dyeing groups. It specializes in producing various colored cloths, producing 2,000-3,000 bolts per day. Currently, due to the difficult environment, they are forced to retreat everywhere and cannot engage in intensive, comprehensive production. The third factory is located at Baijiaqiao in the East Gate. It currently has 20,160 spindles and 416 looms. Due to the cutoff of raw cotton sources, only 7,000 spindles and 200 looms are operating. The rest of the spindles and looms are idle and dormant. They work day and night shifts every Saturday and Sunday, producing about 8 bales of 20-count cotton yarn and about 2 bales of 60-count double-strand yarn per day, and about 500-600 bolts of cotton cloth. The three factories have about 3,000 employees.

The Minfeng Factory is located outside the Small South Gate and has a long history. It currently has 28,500 spindles, producing about 60 bales of 20-count "Fairy" yarn per day, and 300 looms, producing 900 bolts of fine cloth per day. The entire factory employs about 1,600 people. In terms of spinning, due to the difficulty in purchasing raw cotton recently, a portion of the work is only done for the American Aid Flower Yarn Cloth United Corporation to spin 32-count fine yarn. They are working for others and making slow progress, trying to survive this difficult period.

Success in all things ultimately depends on human effort. Liu Guojun, the manager of Dacheng, and Jiang Shangda, the manager of Minfeng, have not only developed their own businesses but have also made real contributions to the local area, implicitly acting as leaders in Changzhou's business community.

Over Eighty Factories, Scattered Like Stars

In addition, scattered throughout the city and suburbs are over eighty small and medium-sized dyeing and weaving factories, such as Tongcheng, Xieyuan, Minhua, and Yifeng, which are all considered outstanding. However, no one can escape the hardships of the times. The textile and dyeing industries today also face a serious crisis. The source of raw cotton is blocked, yarn is scarce, and the prices of coal, oil, electricity, and fuel are expensive. Sales of finished products are declining daily, and the scope is shrinking. Coupled with heavy taxes and levies, although prices are constantly rising, they can never keep up with costs... These series of issues are ruthless and extremely challenging. They demand answers. The price limit imposed on August 19 last year was like a violent storm, and many factories with weaker capital have not yet recovered. The situation is quite "tragic"! There are quite a few "?" symbols, and they are large!

A New Picture of Farming and Weaving in the Countryside

In addition to the dozens of large, medium, and small factories mentioned above, Changzhou's cloth production also has a "scattered troops" production area: rural weaving. Decades of development in which the countryside engages in both farming and weaving have created a completely new picture. This production area is centered on Hutang Bridge outside the South Gate and surrounded by dozens of li of land. Hutang Bridge has become the general term.

Hutang Bridge is a small rural town located about seven li outside the South Gate of Changzhou. The Wuyi Road runs north-south, and a tributary of the Grand Canal runs east-west, providing convenient land and water transportation. The surrounding countryside is dotted with villages and densely populated. Historically, the farmland has not been enough to distribute, and the surplus labor has had to find side jobs to make a living—some handicrafts, such as comb, domino, and playing card making. The water-ground fan bones and bamboo-carved fan bones used to be famous in Hutang Bridge, but they have now declined. What has risen in their place is weaving. The current situation is that in Hutang Bridge, nine out of ten households have looms, with loom connected to loom and weaving following weaving. In the countless villages surrounding Hutang Bridge for more than ten li, loom after loom is connected from door to door, with weaving following weaving. Fields are connected, forming a sea of mulberry, hemp, wheat seedlings, and green clouds. In the villages, in addition to the crowing of chickens and barking of dogs, there is the sound of "click-clack, click-clack" of the looms. Every farm family has at least one loom, and some have as many as three or four. Men and women, old and young, work diligently in their light industry with joyful hearts. Every village and every household thoroughly understands warp yarns, is skilled in sizing yarns, is even more skilled in weaving, can also remember how to dye, and can also sell cloth and buy yarn. They are also good at calculating profits. If each family is likened to a factory, then parents, children, grandchildren, and daughters-in-law are all factory owners, but they are also workers at the same time. There is never any "labor-capital dispute" or "factory management" between them, and there is no "cost of living index." They share joys and hardships, and their interests are aligned. Men and women, old and young, farm when it's time to farm, and weave when it's time to weave. Over the past decade, their hard work has made Hutang Bridge famous for its cloth, creating a beautiful picture of farming and weaving in the local area. New tile-roofed houses have been built in succession in the villages, and every family is well-off, presenting a picture of prosperity. The most commendable point is that there are very few idlers who drink tea and gamble. Diligence and thrift have become the norm.

Three Years of Success in Production Cooperation

In the town, there is a First Cotton Cloth Production Cooperative, which has been established for three years. The chairman of the board is Mr. Yang Tingbao, a local person who is extremely enthusiastic about social causes. The cooperative's headquarters is in Hutang Bridge, and branch offices have been established in Nanxiawu, Mingfeng, and Jiangwan, which are more than ten li away. In the ranks of rural weaving, they have added the strength of organization to production and sales. Generally, the situation is that they are managed in groups, with each village having a group leader to lead the members. Each group has anywhere from two to twenty-two members. One member has one loom. Currently, the Hutang Bridge headquarters has 55 groups, with over 500 looms. Together with the Nanxiawu and Mingfeng branch offices, the total number of looms is between 800 and 900. The looms are all iron-wood treadle looms, which are considered relatively new. The Hutang Bridge headquarters alone produces between 200 and 300 bolts of cloth per day, requiring 6-7 bales of yarn. The products are mostly 10.5-pound 26 plain cloth and light and heavy twill, and 8.5-pound 23 plain cloth and 8-pound type B 23 plain cloth. After the price limit on August 19 last year, in order to make it easier to sell, they produced a large quantity of flour sack cloth. The Shanghai Fu Xing Flour Mill and the local Chengyu Ding Flour Mill are all specially contracted long-term customers. The cooperative adopts absolutely strict standardization for the quality of the products of each member. The length, width, warp and weft density are all stipulated. Any slight difference is rejected. All the white unfinished products are dyed and finished by the dyeing factory. According to the evaluation, the quality is superior and is better than the products of ordinary cloth factories. Therefore, the reputation is outstanding.

The cooperative's business is in production and sales, and it is commendable that it is purely service-oriented. Every morning, members are required to exchange cloth for yarn. The procedures are orderly, and the profits are calculated based on the yarn. The current index is 17 handles of 8-count yarn for plain cloth and 25.5 handles for twill. Depending on the prosperity of the sales, the profits are also reduced accordingly. Everything is based on yarn and is not affected by inflation. Country people do things so honestly. It seems ordinary, but it is actually extraordinary. As for the many weavers in the Hutang Bridge area who do not belong to the cooperative, they each have their own characteristics. The types of cloth woven are not limited to one. Some specialize in weaving woolen cloth, some weave striped cloth, and some weave figured cloth. There are no statistics on the quantity of their finished products. However, every morning, large quantities are brought to the city, and the morning market on Xiyingli Street is entirely a world of yarn and cloth. It is lively and vibrant.

Here, I should mention Mr. Yang Tingbao, who enthusiastically promotes and personally leads this cause.

The Gospel Messenger, Old Man Yang Tingbao

Yang Tingbao is a local and an elder who is over sixty years old, but he is very energetic. He has courage,魄力, enthusiasm, and methods in his life. From his career, he is truly a gospel messenger for the countryside. Twenty years ago, he promoted sericulture in the local area and achieved great success. Then, he tried to operate machine drainage and electric irrigation, which succeeded in 1937. Now, most of the land within thirty li south of Changzhou Hutang Cotton is electric irrigation. This scene is quite new and approaches scientific farming and mechanized farming. Old Man Yang is truly a pioneer. Based on his decades of work experience, Old Man Yang has realized the philosophy of life and explored the truth of the universe. He bravely dedicates himself to society and does not hesitate to sacrifice his small self to benefit the masses in the countryside. He is currently leading a vibrant First Cotton Cloth Production Cooperative in Hutang Bridge, fully demonstrating the cooperative spirit of "I am for everyone" with facts. He has already won the trust of the masses. The headquarters and the Nanxiawu, Mingfeng, and Jiangwan branch offices have a total of over 800 members. All 800+ looms are led by him. Without being a hero, he is still commendable. This reporter had a conversation with Old Man Yang, and Old Man Yang said that if the situation is peaceful, there will be no problem in expanding Hutang Bridge to 5,000 looms. Old Man Yang's next plan is to seek further progress in the current situation. He wants to completely convert the foot-operated iron-wood looms into small Leimada iron looms and weave cloth with electricity. It is very convenient to use the electricity from the Qishuyan Power Plant nearby. If successful, then the products will never have to worry about being eliminated. The products can compete with the exquisite Longtou fine cloth. If successful, then Hutang Bridge will become the largest and most ideal cloth factory in China. I believe that the day of realizing this ideal is not far away! Old Man Yang, stroking his sparse beard, excitedly declared his ideal. This reporter believes that the broad and progressive development of the new farming and weaving picture is very much in line with the traditional spirit of "men farm and women weave" in China for thousands of years. This path of light industrial development will correct the malignant symptoms of "capital concentration and industrial concentration" and turn into a new road of universal benefit and wealth dispersed among the people. Obviously, the dawn of a new rural era has already been revealed in Hutang Bridge.

### National Bank Sells Over 6,000 Taels at High Prices: Gold Market Hits Limit Up with First Sound

Market Opens Up, Rises to Limit Up, Then Price Waxes and Wanes

The gold market's trend this morning reversed the sluggishness of the previous day. After opening at 5.6 million yuan per ten taels, amid widespread buying from brokers, it reached the limit up of 5.68 million yuan around 9:36-37 AM, and trading was suspended. Later, due to retail investors selling at high prices, the price softened, fluctuating between 6.55 million and 6.57 million yuan. By 11:30 AM, the price rose again, with reports of sales exceeding the limit-up price of 5.68 million yuan, but no transactions occurred. At the same time, the Central Bank began to entrust Dadecheng to sell at high prices at 5.64 million yuan, and the market price settled at 5.64 million.

Subsequently, due to the Central Bank's large-scale sales, some brokers lowered their bids to seek purchases, once bidding as low as 5.6 million yuan, but no transactions occurred. Eventually, due to bullish sentiment, the price gradually rebounded to 5.635 million yuan at 11:58 AM, and continued to fluctuate without transactions until the noon close. The final price settled at 5.64 million yuan, up 40,000 yuan from the opening price. However, the off-exchange trend was even more pronounced, with the price remaining high without retracement when the exchange price hit the 5.68 million limit up. Around noon, the price was raised to 5.71 million yuan with buying reported.

In summary, although the Central Bank sold a large amount yesterday, it failed to suppress the market due to strong absorption. From the start of sales at 11:30 AM until half an hour before the close, brokers scrambled to absorb the supply, with actual sales of 632 bars, totaling 6,320 taels, and 3.564 billion yuan recovered.

This afternoon, due to regulations requiring spot transactions for the day's positions, there were many concerns, so the trend showed a waxing and waning pattern. It is expected that the money market will stabilize this morning, and the rising trend may be slightly reduced.

[Another Dispatch] In the afternoon, the on-exchange market opened at 5.89 million, once rising to 5.9 million. Subsequently, major players sold short, and the Central Bank provided covert support, while rumors circulated widely, the boom dissipated, and the market price fell rapidly, all the way down to a closing price of 5.54 million.

The off-exchange market opened at 5.83 million and 5.88 million. After the opening, reports of a stronger on-exchange market bolstered sentiment, and retail investors enthusiastically re-entered, pushing the price up to 5.85 million and 5.9 million. Subsequently, the price fell all the way back down, with the evening close at 5.61 million and 5.64 million.

The US dollar opened this morning at 11,400 yuan and 11,500 yuan, closing at noon at 11,500 yuan and 11,600 yuan. In the afternoon, the market opened at 11,700 yuan and 11,800 yuan, and the evening close was 11,300 yuan and 11,400 yuan.

### Money Market Uncertain, Cash Shortage Unresolved, Number of Returned Checks Increases to Unprecedented Levels

[Our Dispatch] Recently, the money market has been inconsistent, and cash is extremely scarce. As a result of the flood of checks, the percentage of returned checks to exchanged checks at the local check clearing house has reached unprecedented levels in the past week. In particular, the number of returned checks on the 14th reached 4,757, with a returned amount of 1,118,967,470 yuan, accounting for 71% of the day's exchange amount of 156,930,590,042 yuan.

On the 16th, the amount of returned checks was 822,972,219 yuan, accounting for 94% of the day's exchange amount of 167,026,182,151 yuan.

The percentage on the 15th also reached 46%, on the 17th it reached 47%, on the 18th it reached 38%, and on the 19th it reached 26%.

Authorities Investigating Extension of Check Clearing Time

Regarding the fact that the check clearing house automatically extended the clearing time on the 21st, all the way to after business hours on the 22nd, the Gold Control Bureau has dispatched personnel to investigate thoroughly. Yesterday, a person in charge of the bureau said that the handling of this matter is currently awaiting a report from the investigators. Once the report is received, a decision will be made on how to handle it.

He also said that it had previously been stipulated that exchanged checks should be delivered no later than 1:30 PM each day. The reason for this delay was said to be due to a shortage of cash and an excess of checks and bank drafts, but the clearing house did not take steps to prevent this situation beforehand, nor did it report it to the bureau afterwards, which was negligent and should be reprimanded. Such a phenomenon will not be allowed to occur again in the future.

### Erratic Money Market

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday's money market was quite erratic, but ultimately the authorities maintained a loose situation through large-scale intervention. The initial interbank rate in the morning continued the loose trend from the previous day, fluctuating between 60 and 70 yuan. However, there were still many purchase orders, and the interbank rate fell below 60 yuan, reaching a low of 45 yuan.

After 4:00 PM, the loose trend eased somewhat due to the National Bank's large-scale gold sales. However, with large government treasury disbursements and continued inflows of remittances from other locations, the money market remained fundamentally loose. The final interbank rate was around 50 yuan.

Yesterday, the National Bank and its agencies intervened with an unprecedented 7.39 billion yuan, foreign merchants intervened with over 2.3 billion yuan, and banks in the major clearing house intervened with 3.75 billion yuan, while banks in the smaller clearing house intervened with 5.94 billion yuan.

### Stable Hong Kong Exchange Rate

The Hong Kong exchange rate opened this morning at 1,000 yuan and 4 jiao 2 fen, closing last night at 4 jiao 4 fen. The gold yuan opened this morning at 1,000 yuan and 4 jiao 6 fen, closing last night at 4 jiao 4 fen. The Hong Kong gold price opened this morning at 312.5 yuan per Hong Kong tael, closing last night at 311 yuan and 5 jiao. The US dollar telegraphic transfer rate opened this morning at 5.26 yuan, closing last night at 5.25 yuan. The US dollar term bill rate opened this morning at 5.23 yuan, closing last night at 5.22 yuan. The US dollar cash rate opened this morning at 5.23 yuan, closing last night at 5.22 yuan.

### Foreign Exchange Bank Association Holds Fourth Annual Meeting

Welcoming New Members and Electing Standing Committee Members

[Our Dispatch] The Designated Foreign Exchange Bank Association held its fourth annual meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the China Bank Building, 4th floor, welcoming ten new members newly approved by the National Bank to handle foreign exchange. The ten new member companies are: American Commercial, American Express, Central Cooperative Treasury, Guohua, Continental, Hecheng, China Industrial, United, Sichuan Meifeng, and Xinhua. Together with the association's original nineteen members, the total membership has reached twenty-nine. The meeting was chaired by Chen Changtong, representative of the Bank of China. Mr. Chen delivered a report on the association's work over the past year, including financial situation and financial trends.

The election of the members of the standing committee took place and as a result, the following eleven banks were elected: China, Jiaotong, Banque de l'Indochine, Mercantile, Chase, Zhejiang First, Zhongxing, HSBC, Jin Cheng, Citibank, Shanghai.

The standing committee in turn chose members to the executive committee: China, Jiaotong, Citibank, Shanghai, Mercantile. Finally Jiaotong and Citibank were elected as vice chairmen, and Mercantile was elected as secretary. (According to the regulations of the association, the chairman and honorary secretary are permanently held by China and Shanghai Banks respectively.)

The meeting also passed a telegram to congratulate the new finance minister, Liu Gongyun, expressing our determination to fully support and cooperate in future financial stability and trade development. Wheelock shares bought at 60,000 yuan with no sell orders heard, the rest were mediocre. Gold public bonds opened in the morning at 350,000, following the rising trend in the gold market to 365,000, and the price came back down slightly in the afternoon closing at 350,000. A brief trade occurred at 350,000 in the afternoon with only two taels traded, with no further offers.

### Cotton Yarn Market Rises, Fabric Market Rebounds and Fluctuates

The cotton yarn market has become strong again. The money market has loosened, and because the gold price hit the limit-up, the market sentiment has been bolstered. The purchase appetite is now strong, and there are many short covering trades.

In the morning, the initial price for 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was at the 4 million mark, but ultimately the high levels led to abundant selling from retail investors, and the market became weaker in the middle of the day, once reaching only 3.95 million yuan. At the close, short covering trades caused the price to rise back to 3.97 million yuan, up 240,000 yuan from the previous day. The 40-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose 200,000 yuan, while the 32-count Silver Moon yarn declined from 2.7 million yuan to 2.655 million yuan, ultimately rising by 100,500 yuan.

The 21-count Double Horse yarn initially opened at 1.99 million yuan, then jumped over 2 million, followed by a decline to 1.95 million yuan, and finally rose back to the opening price of 1.99 million yuan at the close, up 100,000 yuan. Factory orders and spot prices were even. The 20-count Double Horse yarn rose 90,000 yuan to close at 1.89 million yuan at noon. Other yarns, such as Golden City and Celestial Maiden, all initially opened close to the high levels, but showed declines at the close. Lower grades of 16-count yarn also followed the upward trend.

The fabric market fluctuated at high levels, and shipments to various regions remained limited. Business in the local market was also slow, and market sentiment was difficult to be optimistic. Although various fabrics rose by half a percentage point, this was not enough to cover one day's interest, so there were very few direct sales in the market, and only trading on the tables occurred.

Longtou fine cloth became more active due to the reopening of sales by Fangjian the previous day, and the amount of stock in the market increased. It opened at 83,500 yuan, reached a high of 86,500 yuan, and fell to 80,700 yuan near noon, finally settling at 83,800 yuan, up 3,800 yuan. The price of Labatong fine cloth rose by 4,000 yuan.

The Four Gentlemen yuan beige opened at 77,000 yuan and then fell to 76,200 yuan, once approaching the 80,000 yuan mark. The closing price was back to 78,000 yuan, up 5,000 yuan from the previous day. The Golden Luck Wonderful Dance yuan beige finally closed at 77,000 yuan, also up 5,000 yuan. In addition, factory prices for popular items, such as poplin, floral cloth, and Hanslin, increased by half a percentage point to 10%, while the prices of most other fabrics remained unchanged.

### Rice Prices Stop Rising and Fall, Flour Prices Fluctuate Slightly, Oil Market Sentiment Remains Strong

Rice prices were stable in the Nanshi market and fell in the Beishi market yesterday. The rice prices in the Nanshi market also fell at the opening, but when the news of the gold price hitting its upper limit came to the market, market sentiment was greatly shaken. The sellers raised prices, and the market eventually rebounded, closing at the same level as the previous day, with a slight increase of 500 yuan. The Beishi market fell slightly by 2,000 to 2,500 yuan, as the price had risen too much the previous day. White japonica rice was 62,500 yuan, and special japonica rice was 66,000 yuan. The total volume of goods arriving in the two markets was 4,706 shi.

Edible Oil prices show no sign of stopping rising. The loose money supply, rising gold prices, and strong market sentiment have all contributed. The market opened strong and closed slightly weaker. Soybean oil ultimately saw a sharp increase of 14,000 yuan, with a closing price of 268,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil was 249,000 yuan, up 10,000 yuan. A barrel of auspicious rapeseed oil was 365,000 yuan, an increase of more than 20,000 yuan. The soybean cake market had no sales and the market was very weak.

Flour initially rose and then fell, with not much difference from the previous day. Initially, it was heard that the price of gold and banknotes was rising sharply and the money supply was very loose. The northern merchants were very strong in buying, and the factories did not sell much, so market sentiment was bullish. The morning opening price for various brands of flour all rose by 1,000 yuan. In the middle of the day, it was heard that the National Bank was selling, and market sentiment was weak, so the market became unsustainable and gradually declined. The price for old vehicles fell to 22,200 yuan, and the price for warship fell to 21,380 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains saw mixed results. Soybeans initially rose and then fell, while raw peanuts were in short supply and rose by another 10%. Yangzhou Tizhuang rose to 194,000 yuan. Sesame seeds were stable, red sorghum rose slightly by 2,000 yuan, and corn had weak appetite and declined by more than 1,000 yuan.

### Market Stroll: Onlooker's Commentary

Although the Estimated Issuance Volume Is Accurate, It's Wrong One Minute Later: Small Increases Are Allowed, Big Increases Are Suppressed, and a General Wave Is Approaching

Now running through the market, one only sees an atmosphere of confusion and hesitation.

The amount of Gold Yuan issued, some say 600 billion, some say 1 trillion out of customs, these estimates, even if correct, only last for one minute. The next minute, who knows how many hundreds of millions more will be issued.

The other side of poor sales is the lack of supply. If the two sides are linked, the problem lies in local factors. Paper money floods, and interest accumulates, so it will rise even if it doesn't want to. But with eyes to see and ears to hear, the sounds of the drums are yet another matter.

Receiving paper money makes you unable to sleep, and buying goods weighs on your mind. Thinking it over and over, it's difficult on both sides, so the idea turns to gold, US dollars, and silver dollars that can be carried and stored. But once the wind is tight and the rain is heavy, rice and coal are more important.

Rice comes from the countryside, and coal comes from the north. If they can't come, you still have to eat and burn them. So, insure yourself as much as possible. Whether it's for one month or three months. And so emerges the phenomenon of the "all withered, only one thrives" among the various industries.

"All withered, only one thrives" is by no means normal, so sooner or later, they will all gradually catch up. A universal wave is likely to occur within the next few days.

Yesterday morning there was a small movement, and the Central Bank used its force. In the evening there was another small movement, so let's see how much strength the Central Bank has today. The Central Bank should remember Mr. Bei Zuyi's secret: when there is a small increase, either let it go or incite it to rise even more. Once everyone is caught up in the rising wind, come up with a sudden attack and hit everyone so hard that they can't breathe.

Recently, the Central Bank has often used foreign exchange transfer certificates to provoke rising winds, and then comes the head-on blow. This method only works on seasoned speculators, and ordinary people are easily caught up in the market atmosphere, so it always works.

It is also for this reason that experienced speculators take advantage of the sober to profit from those who are dizzy. And most of those who are dizzy are retail investors, who don't have enough strength, so they collapse as soon as there is a rush, are tripped up by high interest rates, and the Central Bank takes advantage of the situation with a blow, and the effect is immediately seen. Once the effect is seen, experienced speculators rush to cover their positions, and the Central Bank lags behind, inevitably suffering a loss.

### Foreign Stocks Rise Slightly, Gold Prices Mediocre

The foreign stock market was initially high and then low yesterday. Initially, the market sentiment was still strong due to loose money, but then the market softened slightly as floating retail investors sold at high prices. Jardine Matheson saw some trades at 15,400 yuan, up 100 yuan. The closing prices of British American Tobacco and San Miguel were mixed, and Tsingtao Brewery rose nicely at 2,900 yuan and 3,100 yuan, while Jardine Wright rose nicely at 5,800 yuan and 6,100 yuan.

### Foreign Exchange Certificates Rise Sharply Again, Closing at 10,009 Yuan

Foreign exchange transfer certificates rose sharply again yesterday (23rd) following the rise in gold and banknotes. The market opened at 10,300 yuan, and importers immediately bought heavily. The market then reached a new high of 11,000 yuan. Major players took profits and sold, and the market closed slightly softer at 10,900 yuan, up 700 yuan from the closing price the previous day (22nd).

### Military and Government Expenditures Require More Cash, Bank Withdrawals Are Restricted Again

Although the cash shortage has improved slightly since the beginning of this week, with bank withdrawals increasing to 12% on the previous day (22nd), yesterday, due to excessive cash requirements for government treasury expenditures, the bank withdrawal limit was reduced to 10%.

It is understood that the National Bank withdrew approximately 1.5 billion yuan in cash from various banks yesterday, and it is expected that it will be difficult to fully supply the market within the day.

### Silk Market Flat and Soft

Yesterday's silk market saw a looser money supply and sluggish sales. There was more selling than buying, and holding goods was not as profitable as earning interest, so market sentiment was very weak. When the rumor of a Zhongxin Bureau sale was heard, the market became quiet, and the market price declined after opening.

120 Heavenly Bridge Spot was 2.4 million yuan, slightly higher by 100,000 yuan after the opening. Subsequently, the supply became abundant, and the market price fell to 2.37 million yuan. The closing price for the morning was 2.4 million yuan. Overnight positions traded at 2.5 million yuan.

In the afternoon, the gold price declined, market sentiment weakened, and asking prices continued to decline. The initial asking price was 2.45 million yuan, once falling to 2.37 million yuan. The final price was 2.42 million yuan.

Raw Silk With the continued rise in prices of foreign exchange certificates and strong gold prices, market sentiment was slightly better. The price of standard grade was initially 3.6 million yuan, rose as high as 3.7 million yuan, but then fell back down to 3.62 million yuan in the afternoon.

Silk and Satin Dachen Fabric opened in the morning at 1.68 million yuan. After the opening, the buying interest was still strong, and the price rose as high as 1.77 million yuan. The market immediately sold at high prices, and the price fell back down to 1.68 million yuan. The market sentiment improved at noon, and the market price rebounded, again closing at 1.77 million yuan.

### Silk Exports Active

It is understood that the market for silkworm cocoons in Zhejiang is currently quite good. Each dan can be sold for 100 yuan in transfer certificates. Also, the selling price of raw silk overseas is once higher than the price of raw silk.

### Threat of Selling Gold Is Too Great, Chinese Stocks Rebound Sharply After Rising

The Chinese stock market yesterday stopped its decline and turned to rise. The market was initially high and then low. The long and short targets within the circle were different, and their views varied. However, because the short selling force was still strong, the peak only appeared briefly and passed. There were reports that a new cabinet was formed, and peace was expected, which slightly boosted market sentiment. However, the threat of selling gold was significant, the control of money supply was uncertain, and high interest rates prevailed in the market, which also made the bulls disheartened. The short sellers were active, and the future of the stock market was still uncertain.

The price of Yongsha in the morning was initially high, because the money supply was still loose, and also because the gold price rose, which bolstered market sentiment. The morning opened at 7 yuan and 3 jiao, and the market trend was stable after the opening. Various groups were strong in their intention to buy, and the price rose to 7 yuan and 6 jiao and 7 fen. Securities brokers and flower yarn brokers sold, and the price fell to 7 yuan and 5 jiao and 3 fen. Financial brokers forcefully absorbed, and the price rose to 7 yuan and 6 jiao and 1 fen. Later, it was heard that the Central Bank was selling gold, and gold merchants, in order to square their positions, collectively sold aggressively, and market sentiment was timid. Floating bulls became anxious, and a soft wind arose in the market. The market price plunged all the way down to 6 yuan and 9 jiao and 5 fen. After the low, short sellers covered, and the price rebounded, but with heavy fluctuations, market sentiment was depressed, and the soft state remained. The price finally closed at 7 yuan and 2 jiao and 8 fen at noon.

The opening trend of small and medium-sized stocks in the morning was good, but in the middle of the day, because Yongsha fell sharply, market sentiment softened, and the market also showed a tired color. The opening price of Xinguang in the morning was 7 jiao and 3 fen, once rising to 8 jiao and 1 fen, and the closing price at noon was 8 jiao and 05 fen. The opening price of Jingfu was 2 jiao and 9 fen, reaching as high as 3 jiao and 1 fen, and the noon closing price was still at the original level. The price of Qinxing was initially offered at 3 jiao and 8 fen, reaching as high as 4 jiao and 1 fen and 5 li, and the closing price at noon was 3 jiao and 9 fen and 5 li. The price of Meya was 2 yuan and 1 jiao and 5 fen, rising to 2 yuan and 3 jiao after the opening, and then closing at 2 yuan and 3 jiao and 2 fen at noon. The prices of gold and silver stocks were stable, with a trading volume of 4.22635 billion shares.

### Thin Inventory of Bezoar and Musk

In the medicinal materials market, the weather has cleared, and local medicinal slice merchants are replenishing supplies of Radix Ligustici Chuanxiong (Chuanxiong), with many customers from Jiáxiá also present. As a result, prices have risen, with Fǔjí Chuanxiong at 4,500 yuan, Chuanxiong Wang at 4,000 yuan, and Diāo Chuanxiong at 3,600 yuan. Bezoar and musk are being added to prescriptions for medicinal slices, and demand for medicines for feverish diseases is gradually increasing. Industry insiders say that the inventory in Shanghai is low, and incoming goods are scarce, raising concerns about potential shortages. The price has risen to 260,000 yuan, equivalent to only around 37 silver dollars at the current market price. The purchase price at the place of origin is close to breakeven, without covering shipping costs, so prices need to be raised further.

### Women's Basketball Tactics

— Translated by Qi Gong

(2) (Please refer to Diagram 12) This method is related to the second method. If three attackers are used to pressure the defenders in a certain area, the attackers and the defenders in the backcourt are positioned as shown in the diagram above. The center defender guards the central area, watching for the opponent's long-distance passes over the backcourt. A more rigorous full-movement method is shown in (Diagram 13). In the backcourt, the center defender is adjusted to stand at the center line to guard. She must watch the movement of the ball and roam to the left and right. The other two defenders guard the attackers in the backcourt. If the center forward believes that the attackers in the frontcourt are unable to prevent the opponent's defenders from passing the ball over the backcourt, the center defender should immediately retreat to guard her original position.

So, how should one respond when throwing the ball inbounds? This is not difficult. If the ball is thrown inbounds in the east zone, the defender closest to that area should move forward to the sideline to guard. The other two defenders should hold their positions. After the thrower has thrown the ball into the court, the defender must immediately retreat to guard her original position. The movement method is as shown in the initial diagram.

If the opponent's attackers are throwing the ball inbounds under the basket, the defenders should switch to a man-to-man defense until the ball has been passed out of the keyhole circle, after which the defenders should quickly return to the original zone defense. Therefore, the defenders must often discuss how to deal with the attackers to form close coordination.

If the defenders gain possession of the ball, they naturally switch from defense to offense. In this case, the zone defense is abandoned. The defenders should try to pass the ball to each other along the sidelines, making sure to pass the ball to the attackers in the frontcourt. Diagrams 11, 12, and 13 show how the defenders keep the ball in their hands and the defenders' passing routes.

The ultimate conclusion is that a moving zone defense relies on the intelligence of the defenders, precise positioning, close cooperation, and agile movement to be effective. In terms of player selection, the best and tallest defenders should take on the important position of center defender. The most important skill is the ability to move quickly.

The zone defense does not produce results after just one day of practice. It also depends on the players' habits and personalities. This must be done quickly. If the team finds it effective, they may continue to use it.

### Ye Guanxiong Defeats Xiao Xu; A Good Tennis Match in Hong Kong This Year

[Hong Kong, 23rd Dispatch] The first public grass tennis singles semi-final of the year was completed on the 22nd in front of a full crowd. Xiao Xu narrowly lost in straight sets (3-6, 6-8, 5-7) to Ye Guanxiong. However, I must admit that his performance was his best ever. Facing a younger opponent who was slightly superior in skill, he should have lost, but in his defeat, he served ten aces and broke Ye’s "set point" six times. Although only three sets were played, the match lasted one hour and twenty-five minutes, which was more intense than the usual five-set match. One can imagine how exciting it was at the time. After this performance, I am confident that Ye Guanxiong will once again win this year’s singles championship.

Xu Runpei knew that a formidable opponent was in front of him and that old habits die hard. His skills tend to improve as the match progresses. As expected, Ye Guanxiong won the first game after getting the first serve. After reaching a tie, Ye won the game. In the second game, Xiao Xu took advantage of his serve to win four points in a row, taking a clean victory. Then, Ye took a 3-1 lead, followed by Xiao Xu closing the gap to 2-3. In the end, after 17 minutes, Ye Guanxiong won the first set 6-3. Xiao Xu won the second, fifth, and eighth games. This set was dominated by Ye, who served three aces. Xiao Xu made a double fault in the fourth game.

Second set

In the second set, Xiao Xu served first, and after two ties, he lost to Ye. But at this point, Xiao Xu's level gradually showed, and he quickly won two consecutive games, taking the lead for the first time at 2-1. However, Ye chased back to a 2-2 tie and was never able to take the lead again. He trailed 3-3 and then 3-5. The most wonderful part was the ninth game, in which Ye made two successful kill shots, but Xiao Xu took it step by step, not only retaking the lead after a tie but also serving an ace for the second time after the second tie, regaining a 4-5 situation. In the tenth game, Ye had a 40-15 advantage, and everyone thought Xiao Xu would lose 4-6, but Xiao Xu suddenly saved two set points in a row and then saved another set point after the second tie, finally reaching a 5-5 tie amidst thunderous applause. In the thirteenth game, Xiao Xu served two aces, but his strength was gradually failing, and he was defeated by Ye, who took the lead at 7-6. In the fourteenth game, Ye suddenly played aggressively, using both short and long shots, and gained a clean victory, winning the second set again 8-6. This set lasted 43 minutes, which is equivalent to the time of two ordinary sets. Xiao Xu had three aces, and Ye had no aces.

Third set

In the third set, Xiao Xu initially seemed to be lacking in strength, losing the first game cleanly. He only won one point in the second game and took back two points in the third game, losing three games in a row. But from the fourth game onwards, Xiao Xu suddenly recovered and often made excellent shots, winning four games in a row and taking the lead for the second time at 4-3. In these four games, even Ye Guanxiong, as strong as he was, could only take back four points. Ye even submitted a blank sheet in the seventh game, which shows how powerful Xiao Xu was at that time. Unfortunately, good times don't last long. After being chased back to a 4-4 tie by Ye, Xiao Xu could only win one more game, taking the lead for the third time at 5-4, before collapsing completely and quickly losing three games, allowing Ye to win 7-5. Xiao Xu's overall situation collapsed, and this set took 24 minutes to complete at 5:55 PM. In this set, Xiao Xu "received aces" seven times and had "double faults" twice. Ye had "aces" four times. Ye never made a single "unforced error" in the whole match, which shows that Ye's skills have improved even further.

If calculated by points, Ye scored 29 points and Xu scored 20 points in the first set. In the second set, Ye scored 60 points and Xu scored 50 points. The closest was the third set, with Ye scoring 34 points and Xu scoring 30 points. The total for the whole match was 123 points for Ye and just 100 points for Xu, which is a magnificent spectacle.

### "Pearl of Malaya": Wong Peng Soon's Glorious Battle History

[Singapore Dispatch] Being able to win the world badminton individual championship is certainly great, but giving up all possibilities of winning this laurel and contributing the most to Malaya to enable Malaya to win the prestigious Thomas Cup is even more commendable. The former is the American badminton prodigy Freeman, and the latter is Malaya’s Wong Peng Soon.

Wong Peng Soon played in eight matches in the Thomas Cup semi-finals and finals representing the Malayan team, winning seven and losing one.

There is no doubt that Wong Peng Soon would never conserve his energy for the sake of others' honors, preparing to defeat America's Freeman in the All-England Badminton Singles and win the All-England Singles Championship, which symbolizes the world men's badminton singles title. Recalling the semi-finals between Malaya and America in Scotland, Wong Peng Soon took the lead and exhausted all his abilities to defeat America's second-ranked player Varges. Wong Peng Soon's victory was of great importance in establishing the Malayan badminton team's victory. Otherwise, the situation would have been difficult to predict. Recalling the Malaya-Denmark final, Wong Peng Soon again fulfilled his greatest responsibility, defeating Denmark's champion Scalopp, who dominated Europe, and smoothly enabling Malaya to ascend to the throne of the world's badminton kingdom. I remember when Wong Peng Soon defeated Mr. Scalopp in the Malaya-Denmark final in Preston, the 2,000 spectators in the audience stood up spontaneously and applauded enthusiastically for the exhausted Wong Peng Soon. Looking at the entire process of the Thomas Cup, no athlete received the same praise as Wong Peng Soon. Wong Peng Soon is the unshakable rock in the Malayan badminton team. Before this rock-like pillar, the American and Danish badminton teams have all bowed down to him one after another.

Indeed, anyone in the world who loves badminton agrees that Wong Peng Soon's efforts for Malaya to win the Thomas Cup are more significant than if he had given up this effort to win the world badminton singles title. Now, let us briefly introduce Wong Peng Soon's history in badminton. Wong Peng Soon is a Penang Chinese, hailed as the "Pearl of Malaya." In his youth, he studied at English schools in Penang. Among sports, he first became involved with baseball, but he also played football and swam, and participated in Boy Scout activities.

It was not until he was fifteen that he started playing badminton, joining the Penang Chio Yang Badminton Club. Initially, Wong Peng Soon seemed to have no particular interest in badminton and no special characteristics. There was even a time when he was demoted to a lower group due to declining performance.

1937 was Wong Peng Soon's "golden year" of today's fame. In this year, Wong left the Chio Yang Badminton Club and joined the prestigious Linstead Badminton Club in Penang. In this year, Wong Peng Soon began to show his abilities in Penang. In the Penang Open Badminton Championships held in the same year, Wong Peng Soon passed one level after another, only to be eliminated in the semi-finals.

The following year (1938), Wong Peng Soon seemed to change his strategy, giving up competing for the Penang singles championship and partnering with another player, Chen Genfeng, in doubles. In the doubles arena, Wong Peng Soon indeed fulfilled his wish. In the All Badminton Open Championships, Wong Peng Soon and Chen Genfeng partnered to win three consecutive doubles championships and also won the All-Malaya doubles championship once.

Hard work

Just like many famous people who have achieved ultimate success in their careers, Wong Peng Soon reaps today's harvest only after plowing. Wong Peng Soon has put in a lot of effort in badminton and has indeed practiced hard for several years. Wong Peng Soon has spent at least half an hour practicing various basic postures of hitting and intercepting under the guidance of four badminton coaches.

As an athlete, Wong Peng Soon strictly abides by physiological hygiene in terms of health maintenance. He needs to have adequate sleep before the game, and in the days before the sport, he avoids stimulating foods, even the coffee foods generally preferred by Malayans, which he strictly avoids. His reason is: "If our stomach is on fire, we will definitely not be able to play well."

Technically, Wong Peng Soon has not yet reached perfection. He does not have lightning-fast hitting techniques. His main weapons are dealing with high balls, occasional light drops in front of the net, preparedness, and agile steps. In addition, Wong Peng Soon has another feature, that is, his eyesight is sharp, and he can detect the opponent's weaknesses in tense games. Wong Peng Soon uses this specialty to make Denmark's Scalopp useless. When he fought Scalopp in the Malaya-Denmark final, he changed his offensive route quickly after detecting Scalopp's weaknesses. From attacking Scalopp's backhand to pressing his forehand. In addition, in terms of sportsmanship, Wong Peng Soon has a calm and persevering spirit of combat. In Malaya, Wong Peng Soon used this spirit to defeat Wong Bingsoon. Wong Peng Soon's sportsmanship was again proven in the two games in Scotland and Preston. Many people believed that Wong Peng Soon might have exhausted himself and fallen to the ground in each of the games against Freeman (USA), Mantiez (USA), Phillips Bay (Denmark), and Scalopp, but the opposite was true. Wong Peng Soon not only made Freeman (USA) enter a situation where he had to fight hard to win, but also successively defeated Mantiez, Phillips Bay, and Scalopp in situations where his strength was reduced. In scenes where his strength was gradually exhausted, Wong Peng Soon relied entirely on his confidence to fight. Wong Peng Soon's performance in the Malayan Open over the years is outstanding in Malayan badminton history.

1938: Penang Grade B singles champion, Grade B mixed doubles champion, Penang Open men's doubles champion. First represented Penang to participate in the Malayan Inter-City Games. In the same year, he also won the Penang Open singles and doubles championships. Malayan mixed doubles champion.

### Blood's Hypnosis

— Liu Sui

After a great war, there must be a year of famine. Historically, every dynasty feared war, and even more so, the plagues and famines that followed. In China, this historical lesson should be etched in the minds of our generation. However, based on the many facts before our eyes, the bright red blood left on our land for decades has not only failed to awaken everyone to the vigilance of transformation into jade, but on the contrary, the absolute majority of people have fallen into madness in the bloodshed. Right and wrong, grievances, all depend on bloodshed. Before the greatest plagues and famines fall upon us, we have already used blood as mutual sacrifices. The blood shed by the previous generation has instead become a hypnotic for our generation. Is this truly a tragedy of the times?

The ten days of Yangzhou and the three massacres of Jiading are racial hatreds. The "mopping-up" and "city cleansing" by a branch of the "China Expeditionary Army" only demonstrated the barbarity inflicted upon us by another nation. They were irresistible and unavoidable. But recently, during the Xiangxi civil unrest, why did Yuanling suffer the fate of nine out of ten houses being empty? For "the people" to "rebel," there must be hidden pains and sufferings. However, the government belongs to us, and we can accuse and appeal. And if Xiangxi feels pain, how can Yuanling be an exception? Being in the same province, "the people's" interests are the same. Why must the minority who "rebel" subject the majority to the ax?

The discovery of a "boxed corpse" at the North Station was followed by a "bagged corpse" on Xietu Road in less than two weeks. In between, we can see the murderer's techniques have significantly improved. The dismemberment of the corpse has progressed from eight pieces to thirty-two segments. Whether this case involves a love affair, money, or revenge, why must the murderer display the cruelty of human nature to such an extent? Is it inspired by the times? Or does it indicate the extinction of spirituality? It truly makes one unable to bear thinking about it.

The Western heroes of the uncivilized American West also relied on blood to avenge grievances. But they dealt with enemies with only a bullet, a fist, or a kick. Even if Native Americans wanted to eliminate an outsider, it was limited to a guillotine or a rope. "Slaughtering a village" and "dismembering" would probably seem superfluous to them. But in China, it's not like that. It is still flourishing. As a child, listening to elders talk about the past deeds of Zhang Xianzhong and Li Chuang already made one's hair stand on end and filled one with lingering fear. Unexpectedly, such events have reappeared before our eyes. Would you believe that history is progressing?

Yesterday, I saw someone reading a newspaper in a restaurant. Perhaps the dismembered corpse case triggered a reaction in his conscience. He said to another companion: "This murderer is too ruthless! Look..." Unexpectedly, this companion replied coldly: "Brother, you are truly making a fuss over nothing. This is how it is these days. How many people die on the battlefield every day?" At this time and place, it proves that human compassion and self-awareness have been diluted clean by interest-bearing banknotes.

After a great war, there must be a year of famine. Blood is ultimately not the most auspicious thing. We should be terrified by the lessons of blood. We oppose being subjected to the hypnosis of blood.

### This Precedent

— Xu Zhuozhi

I heard that the price of set meals will be based on the price of rice, divided into three levels: 2.5 *sheng*, 2 *sheng*, and 1.3 *sheng*. Because I have to leave the company and eat set meals at nearby restaurants every day except Sunday, rain or shine, all year round, I was particularly surprised to hear this news.

Of course, restaurant owners are very shrewd. Even if a vegetable dish is mixed with a dozen shreds of meat, they will definitely classify it as "Grade A" set meal without mercy. This is secondary. The wonderful thing is that the price of rice may increase at any time, especially when the market report is announced at noon. Then, the story of suddenly increasing the price halfway through the meal, resulting in insufficient money in the pocket to pay the bill, will really come true.

In fact, using rice as a standard is not the most reliable. Because a set meal only includes two small bowls of white rice. In addition, there is a pot of vegetables and a bowl of "Pacific soup." The soup is best based on the market price of soy sauce, let alone. This dish should obviously be based on meat, such as divided into three levels: one *jin* of meat, eight *liang* of meat, four *liang* of meat, etc. Calculated in this way, it becomes complicated, and it seems that a "set meal index" that is adjusted daily must be compiled.

After all, people who eat set meals are not the majority, not comparable to household rice, so no matter how it is calculated, it is fine. It's just that once this precedent is set, it is difficult to guarantee that it will not trigger imitation, such as hairdressing, laundry, trams, buses, etc., can also rise up and demand to be calculated based on the rice price of the day. Then the Gold Yuan Certificate, which is the only legal currency, will be greatly impacted once again.

Precedents cannot be easily set; because once a precedent is set, it is difficult to take it back.

Mangoes, which are produced in Malaysia, the Philippines, India, and other places, have a long history of four thousand years. Residents of the tropics love to eat this kind of thing. Mangoes produced in Brazil, South America, can be as large as twenty-five feet in circumference and seventy feet high, with fruits weighing up to five *jin*.

### Han Tombs in Shaoxing

— Guan Zhou

It was reported the other day that a Han tomb was discovered in Changzhou, and residents flocked to see it, causing a sensation. But this is commonplace for residents in the southeastern mountains of Shaoxing, and they are not surprised at all.

As early as March of the 25th year of the Republic of China, Han tombs were discovered in Shaoxing. The author wrote an article "Han Tombs of Shaoxing" in this newspaper in the 29th year of the Republic of China, recounting the matter. There are many small mountains in the southeastern region of Shaoxing, such as Nanchi, Pingshui, Shangzao, etc., and there are many Han tombs, with no less than two or three thousand unearthed successively, of varying sizes. Small tombs are shaped like large trucks, and burial objects are located at the front of the truck. Villagers are especially careful when excavating this part to avoid breaking porcelain and other objects with hoes. Large tombs have two or three chambers (the one discovered in Changzhou is probably a large tomb), and the chambers are mostly silted up with mud, which makes excavation quite labor-intensive.

After August 13th, the trend of digging ancient tombs became very popular. Villagers called it "panning for ancient tombs," and every tomb was bound to yield something. So antique dealers in Shanghai often sent people to be stationed in the countryside to buy unearthed objects at low prices. However, in the eyes of the villagers, it was still profitable, and they regarded it as a way to make money, so they used it as a side business during the slack season. Later, the county government issued a notice prohibiting it, and violators would be detained. So this work of stealing and digging was held at night. The author once saw them joyfully panning for gold in the ancient tombs at night.

Unearthed antiques include pottery, bronze ware, and iron ware, but there are not many jade objects. Fortunately, they are cheap, and I also bought a lot, which are still preserved today. Pottery such as basins (with protruding zodiac images on the edges), flower pots, water basins, and human figures have different shapes from the current pottery. Bronze ware is the most valuable, especially bronze mirrors, which are most liked by antique dealers. Because they have been buried in the soil for many years, their color has turned black, like black gold. The large ones are four or five inches in diameter, and there are also zodiac signs on the back. (This object is also preserved in the museum on Museum Road in this city).

The tomb bricks are extremely large and heavy, and occasionally there are words on the edges, but there are not many. Those without words are worthless, and those with words are worth a little, such as "Jiaping third year" on one side and "made by so-and-so" on the other. Others such as Phoenix first year, Yellow Dragon first year, Chiwu, Taikang, Yonghe, etc. I checked the chronological table of major events in past dynasties, and they are mostly the reign names of emperors in the Three Kingdoms period and before and after the Three Kingdoms period. (For example, a Phoenix first year brick I own, which I checked is the reign name of Sun Quan). No skeletons have ever been found in the tomb, let alone coffins. Probably because over the years, the people and the wood have rotted away.

Why are the most Han and Jin ancient tombs found in Shaoxing? It is said that because Kuaiji was prosperous in culture and relics during the Three Kingdoms period, literati and refined scholars such as Wang Xizhi moved to Yue to live, so Yang Shie has the saying "Osmanthus blossoms for the first time on the Shanyin road, and the Wang and Xie families are full of Jin and Wu's elegance."

### Eisenhower and the "Chongqing" Battleship

— Pingzhai

The "Chongqing" is finished. Such an ending is really regrettable. Now, recalling its glorious achievements in World War II is really unbearable!

Many people are tracing its heroic battles with Italian warships, saying that it once had the nickname "Silver Light Ghost," and that it later served as the British king's yacht... But they do not know that the Supreme Commanders of the United Nations once took the lead on this light cruiser, braving the enemy's artillery fire, showing unparalleled composure and courage.

On June 6, 1943, just as the Sicilian landings were about to begin, the crew and sailors of the "Chongqing" were suddenly nervous, because several distinguished guests suddenly came to the ship, and this warship was obviously going to be assigned an important task. What task? No one knew.

The two most important of these distinguished guests were: Allied Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower (then only a four-star general), and then Allied Naval Commander Admiral Kirk.

At five o'clock in the dawn on June 7, Captain Agnew was ordered to broadcast to the entire ship, saying, "The air and sea forces are about to attack the Pantelleria military port in the southern end of Sicily. Four cruisers and eight destroyers will participate in this battle. This ship will go to observe the battle." Admiral Kirk roared: "We will not observe the battle. I will take responsibility!"

He immediately issued several orders to his aides. The "Zhendan" immediately changed all the preparations for "observing the battle" and prepared to "participate in the battle."

At 10:30 a.m., it arrived at Liudi Pan Port. The "Zhendan" accelerated its speed, leading all the participating warships, taking the lead, but the artillery fire on the shore was unusually silent. The "Zhendan" returned to the ship and advanced towards the coast in a curved direction, but the other side did not fire. In the blink of an eye, a large number of British dive bombers appeared, raining down bombs on the coastal defense positions. When the smoke rose, the "Zhendan" ship shuddered, and nine cannons fired in unison. At the same time, the ship moved forward slowly, cooperating with other warships, and arrived at the front of the targets of each ship's attack. The sound of artillery continued, and the "Zhendan's" cannon hit the breakwater along the coast, and then fired two hundred yards to the left, shattering the Pantelleria shipyard.

Fifteen minutes after the shelling, the destroyers advanced rapidly to a place two thousand yards from the shore. The artillery fire of the coastal defense forces also became active, and shells fell on the sea surface three hundred yards from the starboard side of the "Zhendan."

There was another burst of heavy artillery fire on the shore, and General Eisenhower suddenly felt a huge shock on the ship, and thought that this time he had been hit. But when he calmed down, he knew that it was the "Zhendan" firing another salvo.

Eisenhower calculated on the ship that if he fought like this, plus five days of air raids, the morale of the Pantelleria garrison would probably be unbearable, so he decided: A general attack on Pantelleria at noon on June 11.

At noon, the "Zhendan" ship returned in complete victory, without any casualties. The only loss was that Admiral Kirk's medal on his chest was shaken off and fell into the sea.

However, on June 11, the "Zhendan" ship did not participate in the general attack, because at noon that day, Admiral Kirk received a telegram. When he gave this telegram to Eisenhower, Eisenhower smiled. The text of the telegram was: "Pantelleria Port has surrendered."
