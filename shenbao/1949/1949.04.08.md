Administrative organs, including the administrative commissioner's office, the county government, the police bureau, and part of the security regiment and police force, are assisting in the defense of the city. The core fortifications of the city have long been completed, and if the Communist forces take the opportunity to penetrate deep, the garrison is determined to defend the core positions and protect this famous city.

In order to take both into account, this case should be discussed with equal emphasis on legal and political viewpoints; (2) Regarding the detailed measures for simplifying the organs, the Executive Yuan should, based on the actual needs of each province and the complexity of the original business, realistically verify and merge the organs as much as possible; (3) Regarding the organization of the provincial governments in the Communist-held areas, in addition to reducing them according to the original opinion, the actual situation should be considered and the organs should be minimized as much as possible.

### Editorial: Will Japan Implement the "Nine Principles"?
The Yoshida Cabinet in Japan has submitted the draft budget for 1949-50 to the House of Representatives on the 4th. Prime Minister Yoshida has also declared to the Diet that the government has guaranteed to implement the nine principles of economic stability instructed by MacArthur. Although the government faces serious difficulties, it will try its best to increase income, balance the budget, and achieve self-reliance without relying on US aid. It is currently unknown what kind of reaction the submission of this large budget will cause in the Diet. However, two points can be made at this time: (1) Shigeru Yoshida has completely bowed to MacArthur, so the so-called subtle relationship between the United States and Japan is essentially servitude. (2) Yoshida has indeed expressed his compliance with the nine economic principles instructed by MacArthur to the Japanese government. From the perspective of the Allied Headquarters, MacArthur has obtained the guarantee from the Japanese government, and MacArthur's measures to control Japan have gained new and powerful effectiveness. From the Japanese side, the burden on the Japanese people will become heavier as Japan strives for self-reliance and implements the nine economic principles. The prosperity of the Japanese economy in the future will only bring about the revival of the old *zaibatsu* and the resurgence of the old militarism, and the world's demand for the democratization of Japan's politics and economy will become increasingly distant and unattainable.

The large budget compiled by the Yoshida Cabinet was compiled by Finance Minister Ikeda Hayato in accordance with the instructions of Dodge, the financial advisor of the Allied Headquarters. During the compilation process, unpleasant incidents occurred several times between the cabinet and the Allied Headquarters. Yoshida once left Tokyo to rest, expressing his passivity towards politics. Ikeda even expressed his intention to resign. Tokyo's *Yomiuri Shimbun* and others also demanded that the cabinet resist the occupying authorities, but as a result of this subtle relationship, Yoshida and Ikeda finally succumbed. The budget bill submitted to the Diet on the 4th of this month is clear evidence of Yoshida's submission. Japanese "politicians" have always suffered from osteomalacia. They are willing to sacrifice the interests of the people and compromise in this way, which will only deepen the morbid state of the weak cabinet and accelerate the collapse of the political economy. This newspaper pointed out in its editorial on April 1 that the unprecedented large budget of the Japanese government illustrates the hopelessness of US aid, and the United States will control Japan with its bare hands. In particular, the unreasonableness of the budget's income and expenditure will inevitably lead to the discrediting of the Yoshida Cabinet, causing the current regime and the position of the Liberal Democratic Party to shrink and decline.

The so-called "Nine Principles for Economic Stability" are organic measures to revive the Japanese economy and arm Japan. They are formulated entirely from the perspective of the interests of American capitalists. To achieve this goal, on October 19th of last year, the Allied Headquarters issued a public letter from "MacArthur to Prime Minister Yoshida," instructing nine principles and ordering the Yoshida Cabinet to quickly formulate measures and implement them. These nine principles, as mentioned above, are the "Nine Principles for Economic Stability," and their contents are as follows: (1) Reduce expenditures. Any measures deemed effective and strong should be implemented immediately so that the consolidated budget can quickly achieve balance. (2) Strengthen the tax collection plan and promote tax payment. Criminal prosecution should be carried out quickly, widely, and thoroughly for tax evaders. (3) Financial institutions' financing of funds should be strictly restricted, and only businesses that contribute to the Japanese economy should be given financing. (4) In order to stabilize wages, an effective wage stabilization plan should be drafted quickly. (5) Strengthen the existing price control plan and expand its scope if necessary. (6) Improve the operation of foreign trade management and strengthen the existing foreign exchange management. (7) Improve the current distribution and rationing system, especially with the goal of promoting export trade. (8) Increase the production of various important domestically produced raw materials and industrial products. (9) Improve the efficiency of the food requisition plan.

Based on the surface of the above nine principles, it seems that every item is necessary for stabilizing the Japanese economy. In reality, they guarantee the stability of American investment and its acquisition of high dividends. The economic revival of Japan stipulated by the nine principles is to help the prosperity of the American foreign market, and in the end, the American economy is still the mother of the Japanese economy. At first, Japan hoped to obtain US aid and then calmly implement the nine principles, so Yoshida did not provide a firm guarantee for the implementation of the nine principles. Recently, the United States' policy towards Japan is to temporarily suspend US aid and require Japan to be self-reliant in everything. Even if the burden on the people is increased, the implementation of the nine principles must be guaranteed without compromise.

In short, the unpleasantness between the Yoshida Cabinet and the Allied Headquarters can be seen as a dispute over demanding US aid and not paying US aid, or as a dispute between an egg and a stone. As a result, the Yoshida Cabinet must succumb. Shigeru Yoshida attended the House of Representatives on the 4th and guaranteed to comply with the nine economic principles. This not only shows the Yoshida weak cabinet bowing to the Allied Headquarters to prolong its cabinet life but also shows that the large budget sacrifices the interests of the people to ensure the implementation of the nine principles. The result will inevitably be that the Japanese economy will be built into a link in the American group. Therefore, we look forward to the future of Japan's finance, which is also full of thorns and reefs and may collapse at any time, becoming the Yoshida Cabinet's fatal wound.

### Barr Attends US House Foreign Affairs Committee to Report on Current Situation in China; Judd Says Chinese Government Can Obtain Glorious Peace
[United Press, Washington, 6th] The former commander of the US Military Advisory Group in China reported to the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 6th about the "good and bad news" regarding the situation in China. Major General Barr, who led the military delegation to train Chinese officers, held a closed-door meeting with the Foreign Affairs Committee members for three hours. He declined to explain what was discussed, but Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Li Yuehan李約翰 said, "We have obtained good and bad news." Other committee members said that the discussion was "not very discouraging." Congressman Judd said that he believes there is hope for obtaining a "glorious peace" rather than a surrender involving a Communist united government. He said that this kind of peace would involve recognizing two governments in China—the Communist government controlling the areas controlled by the Communist army and the Nationalist government in the unoccupied areas. Judd said that the method of agreement depends entirely on the United States continuing to aid the Nationalist Party. Judd also told reporters that he had received several letters from Chinese friends, saying that "for the first time in three years, there is hope for the future of China." The Chinese people have confidence in Acting President Li Zongren and believe that Li has eliminated the corrupt elements in the government. Judd said that his friends also said that, according to news from areas "liberated" by the Communist Party, prices there are extremely high and the standard of living is far lower than in government areas. Congressman Judd said that the Foreign Affairs Committee meeting was informal, and the committee has no plans to further discuss the China issue in the near future. However, he reiterated that the Foreign Affairs Committee hopes that the situation in China can be relatively stable by the end of this congressional session so that the committee can conduct a "comprehensive review" and recommend future aid.

### Allman Calls for Support of Chinese Government in Speech
[Associated Press, New York, 6th] Allman, the publisher of the Shanghai Continental News, gave a speech at the Overseas Press Club here today, calling for the United States to support the central government of China. He claimed that Acting President Li can help China overcome the current difficulties, but only if China is not swept across the country. It is regrettable that the general public in the United States believes the fallacy that the Chinese Nationalist government will collapse and that the Chinese Communist Party is not a true Communist Party. We must support the Nationalist government of China; otherwise, we will allow all of China to be reddened. Although the central government of China is in difficulty, it still possesses land and air forces.

### Griffin Returns to Shanghai After Leaving Japan

### Monitoring of Incidents at Two Schools in Taiwan Turns Moderate; About 20 Students Arrested; Provincial Government Orders Teachers College to Suspend Classes for Reorganization
[Our Taipei Dispatch, 7th] The Taiwan Garrison Command's detention of illegal students from National Taiwan University and National Taiwan Normal University has become less serious in mood than yesterday. Although the military police monitoring the dormitories of National Taiwan University and National Taiwan Normal University still exist, traffic in the vicinity has resumed. The National Taiwan University Hospital, which is right in the surveillance zone, has also resumed medical services, allowing doctors and family members of patients to enter and exit. Various sectors in Taiwan do not feel uneasy about this measure by the Garrison Command. The occurrence of this incident was due to the Garrison Command dispatching personnel on the afternoon of the 5th to arrest Zhou Shenyuan周愼源, a student of National Taiwan Normal University, based on confidential reports. While passing by the National Taiwan University dormitory on Gongyuan Road, he was rescued by National Taiwan University students. That night, they immediately gathered to plan a large-scale march and strike. In order to stop this action from happening, the Garrison Command dispatched military police to monitor and prohibit students from going out at 1:00 AM on the 6th. According to official sources, this was an unavoidable measure. It is understood that to date, in addition to over a hundred students from National Taiwan Normal University voluntarily leaving the school, the number of military police ordered to arrest is around 20.
[Our Taipei Dispatch, 7th] In order to rectify the school spirit, the Provincial Government recently ordered the Teachers College to suspend classes immediately and await reorganization. All students will be re-registered, and classes will be resumed at a later date. The Provincial Government has also issued a notice to all secondary and higher schools to focus on classes but not to take any reckless actions. Chairman Chen expresses great pain over this incident. He hopes that parents can assist the government in rectifying the school spirit. It is understood that parents gathered at the Sun Yat-sen Hall yesterday and expressed their willingness to assist the government.
[Our Taipei Dispatch, 7th] Wu Xize吳錫澤, a spokesman for the Provincial Government, told reporters that the arrested students will be transferred to the court in the near future for legal processing. Also, the Provincial Assembly issued a statement on this matter today, listing four points: (1) The school spirit in Taiwan has always been good, but it is now infected with current habits, which is extremely regrettable. (2) It is hoped that parents will urge their children and students to use reason and focus on their studies. (3) The government is requested to quickly investigate and release the innocent and send the guilty to the court for processing. (4) Education should be protected.

Treasury Minister Reviews Work of the Peiping-Tientsin Committee; Decides to Strengthen Control; Thoroughly Stabilizing Financial Market According to Established Policy

[Special Dispatch] Finance Minister and Governor of the Central Bank, Liu Gongyun, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning after completing his official duties in Nanjing. It is reported that Liu originally planned to accompany President He to Guangzhou to handle the transfer and takeover matters of the Executive Yuan, but due to the massive gold dumping by the Central Bank in Shanghai, and the simultaneous implementation of various measures such as the cessation of accepting bills for same-day value, which have plunged all sectors of the market into an unprecedented state of paralysis, he hastily changed his route to Shanghai in order to plan further stabilization measures. After arriving in Shanghai, Liu attended the regular meeting of the Financial Stabilization Committee yesterday morning, conducting a thorough review of the measures decided by the committee in recent days, analyzing the gains and losses, and deciding to implement further forceful controls on the already battered speculative market, in order to achieve the ultimate goal of comprehensively stabilizing prices.

Subsequently, Liu returned to his office at the Central Bank. As soon as he stepped out of the elevator, he was surrounded by reporters. The reporters bombarded him with questions, to which Liu hastily replied. The key points are recorded as follows: (1) The determination to stabilize the financial market will be consistently implemented, adhering to the established policy and observing future market developments. (2) Although he mentioned the so-called issuance of banknotes with larger denominations during his report to the Legislative Yuan, this was merely an explanation and does not imply the immediate necessity of issuing banknotes with larger denominations. (3) Whether the gold market will be reorganized, and whether silver dollars will be included in the transactions, are still under consideration, and no concrete decisions have been made.

Rampant Off-Exchange Gold Trading Continues; In-Exchange Transactions Remain Stalled After Bills Not Allowed for Same-Day Value

[Special Dispatch] Yesterday, the gold market remained in a state of semi-paralysis. The opening price in the morning was 1,584,000, hitting the upper limit again. Only Yifengyong and Yingfengyong made one large transaction for book transfers. Although there were quotations, there were no actual deals. The Central Bank originally intended to continue massive sales in the middle of the day, but ultimately failed because the settlement method was not determined and the industry could not accept it. Buying and selling were cautious in the afternoon. Before the market closed, members had already left the floor one after another, and no formal transactions were completed until the close. Compared to the previous day, it increased by another 264,000, with an interest of 200 yuan.

According to a person in charge of the gold market, the gold market has always followed the practice of immediate payment for immediate delivery, and all transactions were settled on the same day. Since the prohibition of using bills for same-day value, the industry's turnover has suddenly become ineffective, business operations have encountered difficulties, and transactions cannot be completed, resulting in a standstill. Once there is a flexible solution for the same-day value of bills, it should be able to return to normal in the short term.

Off-Exchange

[Special Dispatch] Off-exchange trading remained rampant. Due to frequent positive news in the morning, the opening price was 1,730,000, 1,780,000, rising all the way to 1,750,000, 1,800,000. There was profit-taking at high levels in the middle, and retail investors flocked out, falling back to 1,580,000, 1,630,000. Silver shops slightly supported the market, and the afternoon close rose to 1,640,000, 1,670,000. Due to the loose money supply and favorable external environment in the afternoon, securities firms, banks, and Shanxi firms competed to buy enthusiastically, and the opening price rose to 1,730,000, 1,780,000. It once rose to 1,780,000, 1,830,000. Before the close, there was more profit-taking, and the upward momentum slightly subsided, falling to 1,680,000, 1,730,000. Finally, it closed at 1,720,000, 1,770,000, an increase of 80,000 compared to the previous day. The next-day interest was increased by 100 yuan. The bid was raised to 1,896,000, 1,947,000, and all transactions were settled with cashier's checks in the morning and transfer applications in the afternoon.

U.S. Dollars

[Special Dispatch] Yesterday, U.S. dollar transactions were scarce. The opening price in the morning was 34,000, 36,000, rising to 36,000, 38,000 and falling to 33,000, 35,000, and the afternoon close was 34,000, 36,000. Due to active trading by money changers in the afternoon, the opening price was 36,000, 38,000, rising to 37,000, 39,000, and falling to 35,000, 37,000. The close was 35,500, 37,500, a decrease of 1,000 compared to the previous day's result. The next-day interest was increased by 100 yuan, and the bid was raised to 39,005, 41,250. Street trading was settled with cash on the same day, and the final bid was 35,000, 37,000.

Silver Dollars

[Special Dispatch] Silver dollar arbitrage was strong yesterday. About one million silver dollars continued to be arbitraged out of South and West China. Street trading was active due to rising prices in other areas, and market sentiment was firm. In the morning, large-head silver dollars were quoted at 30,000, 31,000, rising to 32,000, 34,000 near noon. In the afternoon, they rose further to 34,000, 36,000. Small-head silver dollars were quoted at 26,000, 28,000, and Dragon dollars were quoted at 20,000, 22,000, all increasing by 6,000 compared to the previous day. Cashier's check transactions were even higher, with large-head silver dollars finally quoted at 36,000, 38,000.

Following Silver Dollar Transactions, Minor Currency Transactions Have Been Active on the Streets Recently. Yesterday, 20-cent coins were quoted at 600, 10-cent coins at 300, and 5-cent coins were scarce, quoted at 150 to 200.

Gold Ornaments

[Special Dispatch] Gold ornaments in silver shops changed three times yesterday. In the morning, they were listed at 1,530,000, 1,750,000, rising to 1,570,000, 1,750,000 at noon, and further rising to 1,620,000, 1,800,000 in the afternoon, an increase of 180,000 compared to the previous day. However, the price of silver ornaments remained stable at 16,000, 20,000. Money changers suffered losses, listing at 1,580,000, 1,780,000 in the morning, and rising to 1,700,000, 1,800,000 in the afternoon.

Designated Foreign Exchange Banks Revise Business Hours

[Special Dispatch] Designated foreign exchange banks in the city have decided to revise their business and bill collection hours starting tomorrow in order to coordinate with the recently revised business hours of the Silver, Money, and Trust Associations. The banks held the 20th executive committee meeting at the Central Bank at 3 p.m. yesterday, chaired by Chen Changtong. After discussion, it was decided that the new business hours would be as follows: The time for foreign exchange trading will be tentatively set from 9:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. from Monday to Saturday. It will be difficult to accept transactions outside of these hours.

It is also learned that the Central Bank has recently added Taiwan Bank and Zhongfu Bank as designated foreign exchange banks, bringing the total number of designated foreign exchange banks to forty-one. Among them, the scope of Taiwan Bank's foreign exchange operations is limited to Taiwan.

Yarn Market Gradually Returns to Normal; Sales to Out-of-Town Merchants Decline

Cotton yarn trading is gradually returning to normal. Yesterday, the market started strong but then weakened, and market sentiment was still stable. Demand from out-of-town merchants decreased, and only a few fellow traders and reprocessors made purchases. At the opening, various yarns reached their peak under the support of account holders. Subsequently, due to the wait-and-see attitude of payers, the firm support was weak, and the market closed at a low level. The results were roughly the same as the off-exchange bids on the previous day. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn fell all the way from 12 million to 10.5 million at the end, an increase of 1.85 million compared to Monday. Other yarns such as Jin Cheng and Guang were traded outside the 10 million mark. 21-count Double Horse yarn opened at 5.45 million, rose to 5.75 million in the middle, and then gradually declined, closing at 5.25 million, also an increase of 1.85 million compared to Monday. There were not many transactions for other yarns, and it is difficult to expect improvement in the short term.

Cotton Fabric Trading is Sluggish

Yesterday, the cotton fabric market resumed trading. Most of the previous transactions had been settled, but since bills could not be used for same-day value on that day, it was very inconvenient for businesses to turn over funds. Therefore, holders were mostly in a wait-and-see mode, and local merchants were also reluctant to buy. Trading in the market was sluggish. At the opening, due to the one-day interbank interest rate, the prices of various fabrics saw gains. Top-quality fine cloth was priced at 230,000, and Four Gentlemen serge was priced at 218,000, all in same-day cashier's checks. After the opening, rumors about the current situation were rife, and account holders immediately shouted to lower prices and sell. Finally, after repeated price cuts, the former retreated to 220,000, and the latter to 200,800, still an increase of 41,000 to 48,000 compared to Tuesday. Subsequent transactions were even scarcer, and the trend was slightly firm. Top-quality fine cloth was priced at 240,000, and Four Gentlemen serge was priced at 222,000, but the underlying support was very weak.

Longs Take Profits at High Levels; Shanghai Stocks Rise Initially Then Decline

[Special Dispatch] The Shanghai stock market was dull yesterday due to the political situation becoming more depressing, and market sentiment was worried and uneasy. Both large shorts and large longs remained on the sidelines, and the market trend was flat all the way. Initially, news of loosening money supply was heard, and the overnight interest rate fell to 90 yuan, 100 yuan, but due to consecutive days of gains, longs were keen to take profits at high levels. The opening price was a low of 22.7 yuan. Shorts covered their positions, rising to 23.5 yuan. Shorts exerted pressure, falling again to 21.8 yuan. Subsequently, due to the opening of off-exchange interest rates as low as 75 yuan, 82 yuan, speculative buying rose again, rising again to 23.5 yuan. Longs took profits again at high levels, and retail shorts covered their positions. The market trend was flat, and the fluctuations were still flat. Near noon, news was heard that the Central Bank was dumping yarn in large quantities, and yarn firms dumped forcefully, causing the market to fall, closing at 22.4 yuan.

Small and medium-sized stocks, which were heavily supported behind the scenes the previous day and showed a unique market trend, saw a large number of them dumped yesterday, suppressing retail investors. Xin Guang opened at 1.6 yuan, fell to a low of 1.45 yuan, and closed at 1.56 yuan at noon. Mei Ya closed at 5.45 yuan at noon. Xin He opened low and closed high, and the trend was flat and weak. Qin Xing opened and closed flat. Jing Fu fell sharply at one point after the opening, and there was some buying at low levels near the close, stabilizing the downward trend. Zhong Yi closed at the limit of 0.64 yuan. Zhong Ni was at 9.6 yuan, and Shang Ni was at 2.1 yuan, both seeing limit-downs. Transactions in Tong Yi were scarce after the opening, and large players pushed the price up, leading to a limit-up. Miscellaneous stocks were all weak.

In the after-market, Yong Sha settled transactions, initially trading at 22 yuan. After the opening, it rose slightly but was suppressed by selling pressure, and remained in the 21-yuan range. Subsequently, longs were discouraged, and shorts fully expanded, falling to 19.6 yuan at the limit at the close. For transactions preparing for delivery, Yong Sha initially traded at 23 yuan. After the opening, it trended downward, also falling to 21.5 yuan at the close. Mei Ya still closed at the limit down. Jing Fu was even weaker. Xin Guang's trend was mediocre. Only Jing Lun and Tong Yi saw limit-ups. The total turnover for the day was 2,615,150,000 shares.

Gold Bonds and Foreign Stocks Show Strength

Gold public bonds were bullish yesterday due to the strong gold market, and buying interest increased sharply. The opening price was 700,000 for selling, rising to 790,000 for buying at one point, and the afternoon close retreated slightly, still ending at 750,000. The afternoon opening was 840,000 at the limit-up, with a transaction volume of two taels.

Foreign stocks were booming yesterday, and buying interest was strong. The morning opening was due to the firm gold market, and market sentiment was very high, and bid prices rose repeatedly. Yi Sha traded at 47,000 yuan, 48,000 yuan, Ying Lian traded at 52,000 yuan, 54,000 yuan, and Yi He traded at 80,000 yuan, 90,000 yuan, all increasing by 10% to 20% compared to the previous closing price. Asia traded at 46,000 yuan, 48,000 yuan, and Wheelock traded at 153,000 yuan, 165,000 yuan, all increasing by about 15% to 20%.

High-Quality Rice Disappears from the Market; Second-Crop Early Rice Has Reached the Limit; Edible Oil, Flour, and Miscellaneous Grains All Surge

Due to price limits on rice, high-quality rice has disappeared from the market, and only second-quality early rice is available, opening at 168,000 yuan plus commission to 170,000 (cashier's checks) yuan, which has reached the limit. High-quality white japonica rice and thin rice are not available. The spot price for early rice opened at 160,000 yuan, and the market was nominally flat but actually firm. Few holders showed samples, and there were very few transactions. Coarse japonica rice was 150,000 and 155,000, respectively, and the prices of various types of rice secretly increased by about 10%. The total arrival of goods in the two markets was 3,850 dan.

Edible Oil

Due to loosening credit and off-exchange price increases, the market surged again. Qingdao Jiton raw oil was 1,060,000, and the closing price was 1,020,000, an increase of 140,000. There was little soybean oil, and the price also broke the 1 million mark, exceeding the price of raw oil. Dayouyu soybean oil closed at 1,040,000, an increase of 190,000. Raw rapeseed oil was 920,000, an increase of 70,000. Cooked rapeseed oil and other oils all increased by 15%. Small-cart sesame oil was 1,020,000, and soybean cake increased by 5,000.

Flour

Affected by the sharp increases in various off-exchange goods in recent days, market sentiment was firm, and the initial market prices of various brands of flour all increased by more than 15%. The later market was quite short of cashier's checks, and buyers waited and watched, and sales were extremely slow. The market trend turned sharply downward. Old Car brand opened near the 70,000 mark in the morning, and the closing price fell back by 2,000, trading at 68,000 yuan. Bing Chuan once traded as high as 67,000 yuan, and the later market fell to 64,800 yuan, still a net increase of more than 10% compared to the previous day.

Miscellaneous Grains

Rose across the board. Yellow soybeans rose by more than 15% amid soaring prices for oil cakes. Che beans traded as high as 160,000, winter beans were quoted at 175,000. The Shantou gang in Chaozhou continued to take deliveries of beans and also rose by more than 10%. Transactions in raw kernels were extremely scarce, with a total of only 40 bags, and the Guangdong gang still had sales. Corn rose sharply in the after-market, and red sorghum broke the 80,000 mark.

Improvement in Dishonored Checks

[Special Dispatch] After the suspension of same-day value for bills, the results of the bill exchange in the city on the 5th showed an unprecedented amount of dishonored checks, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the results of the bill exchange on the 6th showed an improvement in the dishonored check situation. On the 6th, the total number of exchanged bills was more than 670,000, and the total amount exchanged was more than 202.5 billion yuan, similar to the total amount exchanged on the 5th, while the number of dishonored checks was more than 11,700, and the amount of dishonored checks was more than 12.4 billion yuan, less than 10% of the total amount exchanged. Compared with the 70 billion yuan of dishonored checks on the 5th, it has decreased dramatically. However, in terms of the amount of dishonored checks itself, it is still quite large.

Yesterday, various banks and firms still refused to accept some cashier's checks issued by small banks and firms for same-day value. According to officials of the Gold Control Bureau, the market is discriminating against cashier's checks issued by various banks and firms, and the bureau is closely investigating the origin of the discrimination. According to regulations, cashier's checks issued by banks and firms are made at the request of customers, and the issued cashier's checks should have sufficient funds deposited in the National Bank. Now that discrimination has occurred, it is necessary to closely investigate the creditworthiness of the discriminated banks and firms to protect the rights and interests of the check holders.

### The CCP Proposes Crossing-the-Yangtze River Demand, Acting President Li Will Reject It, Decision Pending He Yingqin's Return to Nanjing

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 7th] Whether peace talks can begin on the 8th or 9th appears problematic based on the information obtained on the 7th. According to extremely reliable sources, the CCP has already, through the three representatives who came to Nanjing with Liu Zhongrong a few days ago, proposed to the government the demand that the Communist army must cross the Yangtze River. This demand has apparently caused difficulties for Acting President Li and Premier He. An authoritative source acknowledged on the 7th that the issue of crossing the Yangtze River is the biggest obstacle to the start of peace talks, and the CCP's new demand is clearly presented as a "precondition" for the peace talks. It is said that the CCP initially demanded that even after the peace talks are successful, the Communist army must still cross the Yangtze River. This opinion seems to be directed at the idea of "dividing the country along the river." The CCP believes that since the government has agreed to the eight terms as the basis for negotiations, it is tantamount to accepting those eight terms and only slightly relaxing their scope during implementation to facilitate the rapid realization of the eight terms. Based on this viewpoint, the reorganization of the army in the eight terms is no longer a problem, so the Communist army can cross the Yangtze River. The government has not yet agreed to this, so the CCP believes that the government lacks sincerity in seeking peace. Therefore, they further demanded that during the peace talks, the Communist army should be allowed to cross the Yangtze River immediately to monitor the implementation of the first term, punishing war criminals, and the fourth term, reorganizing the army, as a guarantee for the peace talks. This further demand for crossing the Yangtze River was put forward by the three representatives who came to Nanjing on the 5th. The authoritative source believes that the three people who came to Nanjing on the 5th are not representatives of a third party. They may be representatives of the CCP, or one of them may be a representative of the CCP. Their task is to verbally convey the CCP's demand and wait in Nanjing for the government's response to determine whether peace talks can begin on the 8th or 9th. The CCP's intention is that if peace talks begin on the 9th, they can be concluded by the 12th at the latest. Since the eight terms are insisted upon without change, what can be discussed is only technical and scope issues, which should not require more time. After Acting President Li met with the three representatives on the evening of the 5th and learned of this demand, he immediately telegraphed He Yingqin to participate in the discussion. The next morning, He flew to Guangzhou to attend the KMT Central Standing Committee meeting, reported the matter, and listened to the Party's opinions to discuss countermeasures with Acting President Li after returning to Nanjing. It was learned on the 7th that Acting President Li has decided to reject the CCP's demand made in this manner, but the expression of rejection will be decided after He returns to Nanjing.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 7th] According to reliable sources, the peace talks are scheduled to begin on the 8th and end on the 12th. Within these five days, the principles of the eight terms will be discussed to reach preliminary conclusions. Then, the meeting will be adjourned, and representatives from both sides will consult with their respective authorities. However, it is also said that because of the CCP's raising of the issue of crossing the Yangtze River, they may wait for a response from Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin) before deciding when to start the peace talks.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 7th] Foreign news reports that "the CCP has issued an ultimatum demanding the government's actual surrender" and that "Acting President Li has notified diplomatic representatives of Western countries that the Communist army may cross the Yangtze River within ten days" caused great turmoil in the political circles of the capital on the 7th. People close to Acting President Li and government members all denied the matter, and the government spokesman issued a formal statement of denial. Huang Xuecun, director of the Second Bureau of the Presidential Office, commented on the matter to reporters, saying: This news is absolutely untrue. This may be someone deliberately spreading rumors to sabotage peace talks. Huang's basis is that the peace talks have not yet begun, so the CCP should not propose conditions, and the government cannot abruptly notify foreign envoys before a concrete decision is made on this issue. However, according to the reporter's investigation, the CCP's notification was verbal, not in the form of a written ultimatum. Acting President Li did not formally notify diplomatic representatives, but only someone close to Acting President Li informed a certain diplomatic envoy in a private capacity. The foreign news reports are not entirely consistent with the facts.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 7th] The government spokesman specifically and strongly denied the report in several newspapers on the 7th that the CCP had issued an "ultimatum" to the government. The spokesman emphasized: "The government has never received any so-called 'ultimatum,' nor has it notified any diplomatic envoys that the Communist army may cross the Yangtze River within ten days. This news is purely fabricated and has no basis in fact."

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 7th] The two representatives and one staff member from a third party, who came to Nanjing from Beiping accompanied by Liu Zhongrong, have now become the center of attention from all sides, and their actions are extremely mysterious. They are currently staying at Acting President Li's official residence in Fu Hou Gang and rarely go out. Relevant parties explained that the reason for not announcing their names is "to take the Wang Baozhen incident as a warning," entirely for security reasons. According to the reporter's investigation, they did not go through the government peace delegation in Beiping this time, so there are no reports from government representatives in the letters they carried. The relevant parties also suspect whether the government representatives were informed of their arrival in Nanjing beforehand. At 7:00 p.m. on the 7th, Acting President Li hosted a banquet for the three of them at his official residence. In addition to Liu Zhongrong and Cheng Siyuan, only Chen Qitian of the Youth Party was present.

### Rumor: The CCP's Conditions Do Not Allow for Bargaining, The Prospects for Peace Talks Appear Dim, The Communist Party Demands a Response Before Next Week Tuesday

[United Press, Nanjing, 7th] A source said that the CCP has formally demanded the government's unconditional surrender. He said: "Judging from the current signs, the Beiping peace talks are destined to fail because the CCP's demands are by no means acceptable to the government." The CCP suggested that negotiations officially begin on April 9, which the government has accepted.

He declined to disclose the nature of these terms but said that these conditions are truly "appalling" and far exceed the scope of the eight terms published by Mao Zedong on January 14. The CCP's attitude is now very firm, allowing no compromise or room for bargaining, and must be accepted in full, or not accepted at all. Moreover, to strengthen its demand for unconditional surrender, the CCP threatened to cross the Yangtze River completely and occupy all of China immediately. He said: Under these conditions, peace talks cannot continue, and April 12 may be a historic date for China unless "a final miracle occurs to make the CCP change its mind." He firmly refused to disclose the nature of the CCP's unconditional surrender terms, but it is generally believed that they clearly belong to the type of the Beiping Armistice Agreement.

[United Press, Nanjing, reveals:] The CCP has submitted to the government terms similar to unconditional surrender and must give a "yes" or "no" answer before April 12. Among these terms, in addition to the widely rumored point of "establishing a joint committee to replace the Kuomintang government, with Mao Zedong and Li Zongren serving as chairman and vice-chairman respectively," the following are also included: (1) confiscating the property of the "four major families of Jiang, Song, Kong, and Chen"; (2) reorganizing the government's army, navy, and air force into the People's Liberation Army; (3) occupying Nanjing, Shanghai, and several other strategic areas south of the Yangtze River; (4) the government withdrawing from Hubei Province; (5) the CCP controlling the government's financial and economic resources, and the gold bars currently stored in Taiwan and South China must be handed over to the CCP.

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 6th] Acting President Li has refused the Communist Party's request for him to go to Beiping to serve as the vice-chairman of the Joint Committee and to jointly manage the handover of the KMT and Communist armies in the Beiping style. However, the same sources say that Acting President Li's refusal does not necessarily mean that peace talks have broken down.

### CCP Accuses The Government of Preparing for War

[Our News] The CCP radio station broadcast yesterday, claiming that behind the scenes of the peace talks, the Nanjing government is stepping up the reorganization of its army. The Ministry of National Defense has established 14 training headquarters, planning to expand the number of troops from 3.5 million to 5 million. The currently organized troops include two divisions of the 37th Army, and the armies under Qiu Qingquan's Corps and Huang Wei's Corps have been restored. The government sent representatives to conduct peace talks and demanded an "unconditional ceasefire in place" with the intention of preventing or delaying the Communist army's advance to the south of the Yangtze River and taking advantage of this opportunity to complete this large-scale plan to train new troops, becoming part of the world's anti-communist struggle. Therefore, the Communist army can only carry out "thorough extermination," eliminate its armed forces, and capture war criminals and politicians to achieve the goal of liberating the entire China.
