[Our Hankou Dispatch, 25th] It is reported that the Communist troops who left Qishui, eastern Hubei, are moving towards Anqing.

### Railway, Postal, and Telecommunications Freight and Tariff Adjustments to be Made Monthly Starting Next Month; Legislative Yuan Passes Calculation Based on Cost Index

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The method for adjusting railway, postal, and telecommunications freight and tariffs was passed by the Legislative Yuan on the 25th after intense debate. It stipulates that railway, postal, and telecommunications freight and tariffs can be adjusted according to the cost index, once a month, starting from April 1st. Each operating entity must also effectively reduce redundant personnel and tighten expenditures within May of this year, and the staffing levels should be restored to pre-war standards. Given the significant price differences in postage across regions, zonal regulations may be implemented. The case was originally a "Method for Adjusting Railway, Postal, and Telecommunications Freight and Tariffs According to the Cost Index, Related Implementation Measures, and Trial Operation Conditions" submitted by the Executive Yuan for review. During the preliminary review, the railway, postal, and telecommunications authorities directly adjusted rates according to the method, causing widespread anger among legislators. Therefore, the original method was completely revoked during the review and changed to adjusting rates according to the cost of living index for public educators. When submitted to the general assembly for discussion, some committee members believed that the costs of various graduates should be considered, and it was decided to appoint a committee for joint review. The second review overturned the method of adjusting according to the cost of living index for public educators and restored calculation based on the cost index. However, the compilation of the cost index was significantly reduced compared to the original plan of the Executive Yuan. According to the opinions of the review committee, the revised formula significantly reduced prices compared to the original formula. For example, the reduction for railways was 20%, for postal services 31%, and for telecommunications 39%. Committee members also believed that to reduce costs, redundant personnel in various transportation operating entities should be effectively reduced, and expenditures should be tightened. In addition, postal rates should be proportionally regulated in southwestern and northwestern regions, where living standards are lower and prices are cheaper, to reduce the burden on the people. When the matter was raised for discussion at the Yuan meeting on the afternoon of the 25th, it sparked heated debate and controversy. Committee members paid particular attention to the corruption and redundancy of personnel in transportation operating agencies. It was claimed that, taking the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway as an example, before the war, there was an average of only 18 employees per kilometer. The Ministry of Communications stipulated that there should be 24 employees per kilometer. The two railway bureaus have a total length of 482 kilometers. According to pre-war standards, only 8,678 people were needed, or 11,568 people according to the Ministry of Communications regulations. However, the road currently has 23,588 employees, more than 10,000 extra. Employee expenses account for more than 50% of costs. Therefore, only by reducing redundant personnel and tightening expenditures can costs be reduced and freight rates be lowered. Therefore, the resolution that transportation operating entities should reduce redundant personnel and tighten expenditures, and that staffing levels should be restored to pre-war standards by May of this year, was passed smoothly. After item-by-item discussion and a second reading during the meeting, the third reading was omitted, and the method for adjusting railway, postal, and telecommunications freight and tariffs and all related matters for improvement were passed.

### Full Text of Adjustment Method

The full text is recorded as follows: "Method for Adjusting Railway, Postal, and Telecommunications Freight and Tariffs"

(1) This method is formulated in accordance with Article 20 of the State-Owned Enterprise Management Law.

(2) Railway and postal rates may be based on pre-war freight rates and adjusted separately with reference to the current cost index after being submitted to the Executive Yuan for resolution by the competent authority. (3) The method for compiling the cost index is as follows: (A) The cost index for railway freight is based on the following items: (A1) Labor costs account for 45%, which is calculated by multiplying the average rice price index of designated stations along each route by 63% (the average monthly income of current employees is 63% of the average pre-war income). (A2) Coal and fuel costs account for 40%, which is calculated according to the different sources of prices and the proportion of their usage. (A3) Foreign equipment costs account for 6%, which is calculated by multiplying the certificate exchange rate of the US dollar by one-third. (A4) Domestic equipment costs account for 3%, which is calculated using the average cement price index. (A5) Office expenses and other expenses account for 6%, which is calculated using the average rice price index. (B) The cost index for postal rates is based on the following items: (B1) Labor costs account for 50%, which is calculated by multiplying the average rice price index of designated regions by 63% (the average monthly income of current employees is 63% of the average pre-war income). (B2) Transportation costs account for 22%, of which 12% is calculated using the railway freight index, and 10% is calculated by multiplying the certificate exchange rate of the US dollar by one-third. (B3) Business expenses and other expenses account for 28%, of which 16% is calculated using the average newsprint price index, and 12% is calculated using the average coarse cloth price index. (C) The cost index for telecommunications rates is based on the following items: (C1) Labor costs account for 47%, which is calculated by multiplying the average rice price index of designated regions by 63% (the average monthly income of current employees is 63% of the average pre-war income). (C2) Business expenses account for 28%, which is calculated using the average newsprint price index. (C3) Material costs account for 25%, which is calculated by multiplying the certificate exchange rate of the US dollar by one-third.

(4) The cost index multiplied by the pre-war railway and postal rates is the freight and tariff to be adjusted. However, adjustments should be appropriately reduced, at least by 5-6%, and may be adjusted once a month. If the index increase rate does not exceed 20% of the previous adjustment amount, no adjustment will be made.

(5) Price survey areas: (A) Railways: Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway; Hangzhou, Nanchang, Pingxiang, or Zhuzhou on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway; Guangzhou, Hengyang, and Wuchang on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway; Hengyang, Liuzhou, and Guiyang on the Hunan-Guizhou Railway; Kunming and Qujing on the Kunming area Railway; Hankou and Xinyang on the Pinghan Railway; Xi'an, Baoji, and Tianshui on the Longhai Railway; other routes are not listed temporarily due to military reasons. (B) Post and Telecommunications: Guangzhou, Kunming, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Lanzhou, Chongqing, Guilin, Chengdu, Fuzhou, and Taipei.

(6) Investigating authorities: The previous prices were verified by railway, postal, and telecommunications agencies in conjunction with the local governments and chambers of commerce or trade associations in the above-mentioned locations, and then reported to the Ministry of Communications for approval.

(7) The calculation formula for railway, postal, and telecommunications freight and tariffs is as follows: (See attached table)

(8) The implementing rules of this method shall be formulated by the Ministry of Communications.

"Matters for Improvement Related to this Case"

(1) The railway and postal subsidies approved by the government shall be allocated in one lump sum before the 5th of each month according to the subsidy amount for the previous month, and any shortfall shall be made up before the 5th of the following month.

(2) Military transportation and telecommunications expenses shall be paid monthly in cash.

(3) State-owned transportation operating entities shall reduce redundant personnel and tighten expenditures, and their staffing levels shall be restored to pre-war standards by May of this year.

(4) Article 4 of the Postal Law should be revised so that it can be applied to Article 20 of the State-Owned Enterprise Management Law and the provisions of this method.

(5) Postal rates in each region may be proportionally regulated based on price differences.

### Calculation Formulas for Railway, Postal, and Telecommunications Freight and Tariffs

Calculation formula for railway freight: (A) Adjusted freight rate: Pre-war freight rate base × cost index × discount

(B) Cost index = 45% (63% × rice price index) + 40% × coal price index + 6% (% × US dollar exchange rate) + 3% × cement price index + 6% × rice price index

Calculation formula for postal rates:

(A) Adjusted postal rate = Pre-war postal rate base × cost index × discount

Calculation formula for telecommunications and telephone charges:

(A) Adjusted telecommunications and telephone charges = Pre-war telecommunications and telephone charge base × cost index × discount

(B) Cost index = 47% (63% × rice price index) + 28% × newsprint price index + 25% (% × US dollar exchange rate)

### Legislative Yuan to Hold Ninth Meeting on the 30th; New Cabinet to Deliver Policy Report; Three Financial and Economic Bills Resolved Yesterday to be Reviewed Together

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The ninth meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held on the 30th, at which the policy report of the new cabinet will be heard and questioned. The Legislative Yuan's Procedure Committee met on the 25th and only added the case proposed by Wang Yisheng and others, "The Postal Law contradicts the State-Owned Enterprise Management Law, proposing to amend the Postal Law," to the agenda of the next Yuan meeting for discussion along with the seven bills not discussed at the eighth meeting.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The ninth meeting of the Legislative Yuan was originally scheduled for March 29th, but that day is the Memorial Day for Revolutionary Martyrs, and all agencies are closed for one day. Tong Guanxian proposed at the Yuan meeting on the morning of the 25th to hold it on the 30th, which was passed.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The eighth meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 25th, chaired by Tong Guanxian. After reporting on matters, the following were discussed: (1) Yang Buping and others proposed that the Yuan should consult the government and negotiate with the CCP to agree on a time and place to start peace talks. The case had been passed by the previous Yuan meeting and only needed to be organized. The government has now appointed representatives and notified the Communist side, and there is no need to submit this case. It was resolved to retain it. (2) Yang Baodong and others proposed to issue special national salvation bonds to stabilize the currency and prices, establish economic credit, and stabilize social life in order to save the national crisis. It was resolved to submit the case to the Finance and Economics Committee for review. (3) The President consulted the Executive Yuan and requested that the financial and economic reform plan be promulgated in accordance with the provisional clauses of the Constitution. It has been clearly ordered by the government to promulgate it for reference. (4) Zhu Huqing and others proposed that the current economic situation is extremely critical, and the government's financial measures are chaotic, the policies are unclear, there is no budget for revenue and expenditure, and the issuance is endless. The recently promulgated financial and economic reform plan is even more of a mess. The Yuan should, in accordance with Article 59 and Article 57, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution, resolve to request the government to change and correct it as soon as possible in order to save the situation. (5) Qiu Hanping and others proposed that in order to unify the currency system and implement the silver standard, the gold yuan notes should be recovered, silver dollars should be re-minted, and silver dollar notes should be issued to stabilize prices and benefit the people's livelihood. The above three cases were discussed together and resolved to be submitted to the Finance and Economics Committee and the Budget Committee for joint review. The meeting continued at 4:00 PM, and the chairman announced a change to the agenda, advancing the review of the "Method for Adjusting Railway, Postal, and Telecommunications Freight and Tariffs." After being revised and passed (see separate article), the revision of the Legislative Yuan Organization Law and the Legislative Yuan Committee Organization Method continued to be discussed. Due to time constraints, it was decided to move it to the next meeting for discussion, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.

### Chen Cheng Arrives in Taiwan from Xikou; Zhu Shaoliang Accompanies Him and Will Stay Briefly Before Returning to Fuzhou

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 25th] Chen Cheng, Zhu Shaoliang, Yan Jiagan, and others returned to Taipei on the 25th at 4:00 PM on a special Tianxiong aircraft. Chen and Zhu flew to Ningbo on the 24th and then went to Xikou to see President Jiang and stayed overnight. They flew to Taiwan at 2:00 PM on the 25th. Because the Fuzhou airport is under repair and cannot land, Zhu will stay in Taiwan for a few days and then return to Fuzhou. Chen is scheduled to meet with reporters on the 26th to announce the progress of this trip.

[Central News Agency Taipei Dispatch, 25th] After Chen Cheng flew from Xikou to Taipei on the afternoon of the 25th, he replied in writing to reporters from various newspapers, saying: "I arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 23rd and arrived in Xikou on the afternoon of the 24th. I stayed overnight in Xikou and saw President Jiang. He is in good health and spirits. President Jiang did not give any instructions regarding Taiwan, but hopes to strive for stability in the rear and work hard to increase production so that the people's lives can be improved." Chen also said in his written statement: "During this difficult period, the new cabinet was able to be quickly formed and the agency was simplified, which is very well received by all parties. Peace talks have not yet begun, and it is still difficult to report on the future progress." Regarding the simplification of provincial agencies, Chen said: "Taiwan province has many business agencies, and those that are unnecessary have been automatically reduced."

### Wang Shijie on Taiwan

The Legal Nature is Different from Japan and Germany; There is Absolutely No Question that It Belongs to Our Country

[United Press Taipei Dispatch, 25th] Former Foreign Minister Wang Shijie stated in a speech at the Rotary Club yesterday that the Chinese government has full sovereignty and freedom to rule Taiwan. Wang's remarks were obviously to refute the recent widespread speculation that the fate of Taiwan will be decided in the future peace treaty with Japan. Wang pointed out that the legal nature of Taiwan is different from that of Japan and Germany for three reasons: (1) When China declared war on Japan in December 1941, it stated its intention to abolish the treaty in which Taiwan was ceded to Japan. (2) At the Cairo Conference, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union agreed to return Taiwan to China after the war. (3) In 1945, Japan was defeated and signed an unconditional surrender document, so there is absolutely no question that Taiwan belongs to China. Taiwan has been enslaved by Japanese imperialism for 50 years, so peace-loving Chinese people must concentrate their efforts to defend the region to prevent another wave of imperialism. If the people of Taiwan do not guard against the CCP's attack under the command of the Third International, they will fall into another dark period and lose their freedom and independence. There is no freedom in the areas occupied by the CCP, the facts are all there. Some so-called liberal figures have remained silent about the situation in Peiping and the Northeast.

### Peace Talk Representatives Discuss All Day; Military Chiefs Participate in Discussions on Troop Reorganization; Will Travel Immediately Once the CCP Sets Time and Place

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Government peace talk representatives met all day on the 25th to discuss preparations for various issues related to the peace talks. Acting President Li also participated in the discussion. The content was quite extensive. In addition to Huang Shaohong, who is still in Hong Kong, Zhang Shizhao also rushed to Nanjing on the night train of the 24th. In addition to the four peace talk representatives, Xu Yongchang, Gui Yongqing, Zhou Zhirou, Gu Zhutong, and others also attended the meeting at the Ministry of National Defense at the invitation of He Yingqin at 10:00 AM. He Yingqin presided over the meeting, which did not end until after the meal. It is heard that the theme of the meeting may be related to the issue of troop reorganization. After the representatives took a short rest in the afternoon, they went to He's official residence in Menjizha for dinner at 7:00 PM and continued to discuss various issues. At 9:00 PM, Acting President Li also attended the meeting, which did not end until midnight. According to official sources: The government's peace talk representatives are only waiting for news from the CCP. Once the CCP specifies the location and time and representatives, our delegation can travel immediately. The start of peace talks can be expected soon, and the government's opinions on peace talks, Acting President Li and President He are consistent. The current discussions are preparations for some detailed issues.

[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] It is widely rumored here that the peace talk representatives may depart for Peiping within ten days, but officials cannot yet confirm this.

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Shao Lizi was re-appointed as the government's peace talk representative with the CCP after a resolution by the Executive Yuan today. However, Shao expressed that he is not optimistic about the future of the peace talks. He said: He had already requested the government to resign from his position as a representative, but it was not approved, so he had to reluctantly take on this important task again. He believes that there are many practical difficulties in the peace talks. If the CCP insists on the eight conditions, the future of the peace talks is not optimistic. However, he will reluctantly take on the role of representative and do his best, taking one step at a time.

[Associated Press Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Li Zheng told reporters: He is not optimistic about the future of the peace talks, but at the same time, he also emphasized that he is not pessimistic. He said: Because peace is now the demand of all the people, we must make sincere efforts to achieve it.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Legislative Yuan members Chen Ruxuan and 34 others, and Huang Jianzhong and 23 others, proposed two identically-worded motions in the Yuan meeting on the afternoon of the 25th, requesting that before the government's peace talk representatives depart, they be invited to attend a plenary meeting of the Yuan to exchange views on the peace issue, which was passed unanimously.

### Mao Zedong, Zhu De, and Others Arrive in Peiping; CCP Party and Military Headquarters Move to Peiping to Work

[Associated Press San Francisco Dispatch, 25th] On the 25th, the CCP broadcast still referred to Peiping as the former capital and has not officially named it the capital.

[Our Report] The CCP's Peiping Radio broadcast that the CCP Central Committee and the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army moved to Peiping to work on the 25th. Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Ren Bishi, Lin Boqu, and others flew to Peiping at around 4:00 PM on the 25th. Lin Biao, Ye Jianying, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Guo Moruo, and others went to the Xiyuan Airport to welcome them.

[Associated Press San Francisco Dispatch, 25th] Political observers here believe that the relocation of the Communist Party headquarters to Peiping indicates that the Communist Party is preparing to start peace talks, as Communist leaders hinted earlier this year that they were prepared to start peace talks after completely occupying Peiping. The fact that the Communist Party headquarters has now moved to Peiping means that the date of peace talks is not far away.

### North-South Navigation and Exchange of Materials; Shipping Industry Formulates Plan; President He Orders Submission to Ministers of Economic Affairs and Finance for Review

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] National shipping industry representatives Wei Wenhan, Li Yunliang, Hu Shiyuan, Shen Qi, Zhong Shandao, and Shanghai Maritime Bureau Director Hong Ruitao, along with eight others, arrived in Nanjing by train from Shanghai on the morning of the 25th for the issue of North-South navigation and maintaining shipping rights. Wei and others visited President He at Doujizha at 8:00 AM, Sun Yueqi at 10:00 AM, Duanmu Jie and Guo Chan at 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM respectively, and Shao Lizi at 5:00 PM. They are scheduled to visit Acting President Li on the morning of the 26th. Wei and others carried a detailed report on negotiating navigation issues in Peiping and a plan formulated in accordance with the instructions of the Executive Yuan. In addition to navigation, they also put forward concrete suggestions for the exchange of materials between the North and the South, and are scheduled to return to Shanghai at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 26th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] After the shipping industry formulated a concrete plan for North-South navigation and the exchange of materials in accordance with the instructions of the Executive Yuan, President He has appointed Ministers of Transportation Duanmu Jie, Minister of Economic Affairs Sun Yueqi, and Minister of Finance Liu Gongyun to convene a meeting for review in the short term. Once the official plan has been reviewed and completed, it can be submitted to the Administrative Yuan meeting for approval and implementation. The content of the plan stipulates that the navigation locations include the Qinhuangdao-Shanghai and Tianjin-Shanghai lines. The categories of materials to be exchanged also extend to items other than coal and flour. The North can exchange coal, caustic soda, soybeans, and other items for tea, sugar, and light industrial products from the South. As for the technical issues of passenger travel incidental to navigation, they remain to be further negotiated. It is widely believed that both the government and the CCP are actively promoting the early realization of navigation for the convenience of the people of the North and the South, and navigation is expected to officially begin next month.

### Huang Shao-gu's Hasty Trip

Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning, Returned to Beijing the Same Night

[Our Newspaper's Report] Executive Yuan Secretary-General Huang Shao-gu arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. In the morning, he visited General Tang Enbo with a friend, and he took a train back to Beijing that night. According to Huang, his trip to Shanghai was purely for personal matters and there were no other missions involved. The rumor that he was searching for senior personnel to join the Executive Yuan is unreasonable. When asked if the Executive Yuan was preparing to move back to Nanjing, Huang said that in the future, political affairs would be handled in Nanjing and administrative affairs would be handled in Guangzhou. How to connect them is a technical issue, and he himself is prepared to run between the two places. Premier He will visit Guangzhou, with the date set after he gives a policy report to the Legislative Yuan. Regarding the peace talks, Huang said that it would be better to say less. The government's peace plan has not yet been completed. Whether there are differences of opinion between Nanjing and Guangzhou, he did not know the details because he had only attended one meeting in the Executive Yuan.

### Hang Liwu's Remarks in Taiwan: Seeking to Improve Professors' Salaries

[Our Newspaper's Taipei, 25th Dispatch] Minister of Education Hang Liwu stated that the universality of national education in Taiwan Province is the best in the country. Building on this foundation to develop education is indeed promising. He expressed great concern about the salaries of professors in universities and colleges in the mainland, saying that he would do his best to improve them, but due to limited funds, it is still difficult to say how much practical benefit can be achieved. He will be flying to Beijing soon.

### Ma Hongkui to Fly to Beijing in a Few Days

[Our Newspaper's Lanzhou, 25th Dispatch] Ningxia Chairman Ma Hongkui, in response to a telegram from Acting President Li, will fly to Beijing in a few days. However, due to the spring thaw at the Ningxia airport, aircraft cannot take off or land. The runway is currently being reinforced. If this is still unsuccessful, Ma will come to Lanzhou and take a plane east.

Editorial

### Stabilize Anqing!

Just as the calls for peace talks were hanging by a thread, the flames of war in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River have rekindled, which is extremely worrying and distressing. According to a special dispatch from Nanjing in yesterday's edition of this newspaper, after completing their reorganization and replenishment, the communist forces north of the Yangtze River have formally begun to gradually increase pressure on the Nationalist army's bridgehead positions. Among them, starting from the border of Hubei and Anhui, with the exception of Yuxikou (opposite Wuhu), Jiangpu, the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, and Dahekou (southeast of Luhe), which remain relatively calm, there are still small-scale skirmishes in Yizheng, Shierwei, Guazhou, and Shijiaqiao. The Nationalist forces, limited by the terrain, had to automatically abandon Kouan (south of Taixian), Qianshan, Taihu, Wangjiang and other places on the 21st. In the Anqing area, starting on the 22nd, more than ten thousand communist troops were discovered marching south in two routes from Qianshan's Gaohebu. The Nationalist forces fought and retreated, and are now concentrated on the line of Jixianguan West Road Wanshankou Town on the outskirts of Anqing (more than ten miles from Anqing City), engaged in fierce fighting. At the same time, the personnel of the Anhui Provincial Government, who were originally working in Anqing, also began to evacuate to Tunxi via Wuhu at this time. General Xia Wei, the former chairman of Anhui Province, will be in charge of military affairs exclusively, and the position of chairman has been announced by the Executive Yuan to be filled by Zhang Yangchun. These signs all indicate that the situation in central Anhui has indeed reached a critical stage, and the flames of war on the north bank of the Yangtze River will be difficult to avoid due to the active advance of the communist forces.

Anhui is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, both north and south, and the terrain advantage lies on the north bank. Anhui Province is the abdomen of the Yangtze River, and Anqing is its provincial capital, facing the Yangtze River. Its geographical value lies in its reliance on the Yangtze and Huai rivers as mutual defensive barriers. Since the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign last year, when Tongcheng and Hefei fell into the hands of the communist forces, Anqing's situation has become increasingly isolated, with a superficial rather than substantial defense, becoming a bridgehead on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, controlling the outer perimeter of the capital. Therefore, the gain or loss of Anqing is extremely important, relating to the status of the capital and the traffic on the Yangtze River. Gu Zuyu of the Ming Dynasty pointed out the importance of Anqing's position in his book "Essentials of Historical Geography": "Anqing Prefecture is the barrier of the Huai River and the pivotal point of the Yangtze River. Xu Cong said: 'Anhui's territory, if China (note, meaning central China) obtains it, can control the area south of the Yangtze River; if the area south of the Yangtze River obtains it, it can also benefit China. And Xiaogu has always been a place controlling the Yangtze River.' Thus, Anqing is the gateway to Jinling; Xiaogu is the gateway to Anqing." Gu Zuyu revealed the relationship between Anqing and Jinling based on the historical experience of the Jin people invading south. The military failure of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in the Qing Dynasty was also due to the loss of Anqing's strategic advantage. Hong Yang believed that the Yangtze River was a natural barrier, which could ensure the safety of Jinling, but they failed to deeply understand Gu Zuyu's warning. Zeng Guofan led the Xiang Army to attack the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and besiege Jinling, first taking Anqing as the main camp. As a result, the Yangtze River was pacified successfully, and the effect of controlling both the inner and outer regions was achieved. This was Zeng Guofan's success in understanding history and geography. From the above geographical advantages and historical evolution, it can be seen that the gain or loss of Anqing is by no means just a gain or loss of Anqing alone, but is greatly related to the fate of Nanjing and the safety of the Yangtze River.

Our modern military and political strategists, especially the generals who currently only rely on strong armor and sharp weapons, often neglect geographical advantages and historical experience, which often leads to major mistakes. In the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign last year, abandoning the Huai River to defend the Yangtze River, making Anqing's situation isolated, can be said to have already led to a major mistake. Zhao Fan of the past said, "With the Huai River, there is the Yangtze River; without the Huai River, the area north of the Yangtze River is full of reeds and rushes, where the enemy can all secretly cross the river. With thousands of miles of the Yangtze River, how can we defend it from all directions?" This shows that with the Qin and Huai rivers defending the Yangtze River, it is already quite difficult to defend. Now, the communist forces are taking advantage of the opportunity of peace talks and the government's indecision over the past two or three months to prepare to lightly take Anqing, a water and land defense area, from the junction of the Huai River, well-versed in historical facts. However, the military and political leaders of the capital seem to have failed to pay attention to the deployment and intentions of the communist forces, and may repeat major mistakes, leading to an irreversible situation. In the past, when the Jin soldiers divided their forces to invade Anhui Province, the Yangtze and Huai rivers were in imminent danger. At that time, Qiu Chong was the pacifier of the two Huai rivers. Someone advised Chong to abandon Luhe to defend the Yangtze River. Chong secretly said, "Abandoning the Huai River is to share the danger of the Yangtze River with the enemy. I will coexist and perish with Huainan." Although the general trend was unfavorable and Qiu Chong's hard fighting failed, General Qiu's insight wrote his glorious deeds in the history of war. This is sufficient for later generations to deeply reflect upon.

Looking at the current situation of the communist forces, militarily, they intend to break through the bridgehead line from Wuhan to Nantong on the north bank one by one, as a convenient route for the next step of crossing the river eastward. Politically, they are using military force as a backing for peace talks, intending to obtain an overwhelmingly advantageous negotiating condition to achieve the practical effect of a surrender under the city walls. This two-pronged offensive seems to have already started with the attack on Anqing. Therefore, the gain or loss of Anqing is not only related to the survival of all the bridgehead positions on the north bank, but also greatly related to the conditions discussed during possible peace talks. In order to ensure the attainment of genuine peace, on the one hand, we hope that the communist forces will not use military attacks to exert pressure during the peace talks; on the other hand, we hope that the government will learn from historical experience and lessons, and should not easily give up Anqing in its efforts to strive for peace!

In short, the abandonment of Anqing will lead to the risk of the severance of water transportation on the Yangtze River, and even the threat of the loss of the capital's safety may immediately arise. This situation is unbearable to imagine! Therefore, stabilizing Anqing and seeking peace have the same important value today. We believe that Acting President Li's efforts to prepare for peace and Premier He's cabinet's efforts to prepare for the defense of the Yangtze River are equally indispensable, like the two wheels of a cart. Whether they can closely coordinate to achieve their tasks should be tested by the defense of Anqing.

### The "Heping" (Peace) Steamer on the Hong Kong-Guangzhou Route Exploded and Sank After Hitting a Mine; Less Than Half of the More Than 500 Passengers Survived

[Our Newspaper's Guangzhou, 25th Dispatch] The "Heping" steamer (formerly known as "Lihang"), sailing on the Guangzhou-Hong Kong route, known in foreign dispatches as the "Miss Orient," recently hit a mine in the Pearl River after the Shimen steamer. The steamer departed from Guangzhou for Hong Kong at 9:00 p.m. on the 24th. At about 10:00 p.m., while sailing through the waters of Humen, it suddenly hit a mine, which exploded on the left side of the ship. The entire ship immediately capsized. At that time, there were more than 500 passengers on board. Currently, only 225 people have survived. The rest were either killed by the explosion or are missing. Eight injured have been transported back to this city for treatment. The local maritime administration, seafarers' union, and relevant authorities have dispatched personnel to provide rescue. In addition, the steamer belongs to a British company and recently began sailing on the Hong Kong-Guangzhou route. It weighs about a thousand tons and has a dance hall, and is known for its splendor.

[Reuters Hong Kong, 25th Dispatch] The steamer "Miss Orient," traveling between Hong Kong and Guangzhou, hit a mine about six miles from Guangzhou last night. It is suspected that the mine was planted by bandits, as the ship had received threatening letters demanding "protection money" for several months.

### Supervisory Committee Member Cao Xuan Reports to the Control Yuan: The Main Reason for the Departure of the Chongqing Warship Was Friction Between Naval Factions

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing, 25th Dispatch] Supervisory Committee members Cao Dexuan and Lu Fengkai, who went to Shanghai to investigate the case of the departure of the Chongqing warship, returned to Beijing on the morning of the 25th. At the Control Yuan meeting on the morning of the 25th, Cao reported on the investigation process. According to Cao, the most important reason for the departure of the Chongqing warship was friction between naval factions. The original captain, Deng Zhaoxiang, belonged to the Mawei faction, while the newly appointed captain, Lu Dongge, belonged to the Qingdao faction. The issuance of the order to change the captain aroused dissatisfaction from Deng Zhaoxiang and the Mawei faction officers and soldiers on the ship, and therefore they left in anger. It was neither due to excessively poor treatment nor due to the conspiracy and instigation of the Communist Party. According to General Commander Gui and Chief of Staff Zhao, the treatment of the officers and soldiers of the Chongqing warship has always been better than that of other warships, and there were no signs of dissatisfaction beforehand. However, the departure of the Chongqing warship may have been a temporary premeditated act by Deng Zhaoxiang. On the 21st of last month, when the Naval Headquarters held a meeting in Shanghai, Deng ordered the deputy captain, who was not from the Mawei faction, to attend, and ordered more than forty other sailors who were not from the Mawei faction to go ashore. When the appointment of the new captain was announced on the 21st, the Chongqing warship left on the 22nd under the pretext of a sea trial, sailing seventeen nautical miles that day and then turning back. Based on this information, it can be known that the Chongqing warship intended to leave. Because if it was a sea trial, it only needed to sail thirteen nautical miles, and its return was also due to heavy fog. After the Chongqing warship left, no communist soldiers boarded the ship until Yantai. When it reached Huludao, more than two hundred communist soldiers boarded the ship and replaced the original gunners on the ship. The reason why there was no fierce resistance when the air force bombed was because of this. After Cao's report, several committee members spoke, believing that Gui could not shirk his responsibility, but some committee members also believed that further detailed investigation should be conducted, and advocated that the case of impeaching Gui Yongqing should be seriously considered.

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 25th Dispatch] Supervisory Committee member Cao Deyi stated during his report on the investigation of the Chongqing warship incident at the Control Yuan meeting: The rumor that a large amount of gold and silver was stored on the ship was not true. There were only 300,000 silver dollars for the welfare of the officers and soldiers on board. Committee member Cao also revealed that in addition to the Chongqing warship, the Huang'an and Changbai warships and Landing Craft No. 201 also defected from the naval system.

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing, 25th Dispatch] Regarding the departure of the Chongqing warship, Legislative Yuan members Li Yaxian and others proposed that Minister of National Defense Xu Yongchang, Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong, and Naval Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing attend the meeting to explain the reasons and responsibilities, and investigate the case of the missing Commander of the Thirteenth Pacification Zone, Wang Lingyun. The proposal was resubmitted to the Legislative Yuan meeting on the morning of the 25th, and it was decided that the new Premier of the Executive Yuan would attend the Legislative Yuan meeting on the morning of the 30th to deliver a policy report, and the military authorities could be invited to attend the report that afternoon, at which time questions would be raised. The meeting passed without dissent.

Deng Zhaoxiang Arrives in Shenyang

From the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th, multiple bomber planes with American emblems repeatedly bombed Huludao, and the Chongqing warship was eventually sunk. The broadcast also stated that three American naval submarines were discovered in the waters off Huludao on the 19th. The broadcast also claimed that after the Chongqing warship arrived in Huludao, Captain Deng Zhaoxiang sent a telegram to Mao Zedong and Zhu De, and Mao and Zhu replied on the 24th.

### US Policy Statement on China: Truman Unwilling to Issue; Congressman Herter Criticizes US Policy of Silence on China

[United Press Washington, 24th Dispatch] President Truman told a press conference on the 24th that he did not think a statement on China policy should be issued, so there would be no statement on China policy in the near future. The President made this statement when answering a question about the possibility of issuing a statement on China policy in the near future. His answer seemed to be consistent with the State Department's policy of not issuing a US statement on China policy. At the same time, Republican Congressman Herter had previously denounced the US policy of silence on China in a speech to the House of Representatives. A copy of his speech was distributed by the post office in Washington. Herter said, "When the Secretary of State has to discuss our China policy in a closed meeting, there is obviously something wrong. If our China policy is clear and rational, then the questions we raised to the President in the letter should be answered publicly and clearly." Herter said, "The State Department has not only failed, but has succeeded in making communist progress unhindered. We, like the executive branch of the government, should be responsible for the security and glory of China."

[Associated Press Washington, 24th Dispatch] Democratic Senator McCarran announced today that the State Department has submitted a report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, deciding to no longer support the Chinese government. According to Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of State Acheson was asked to express his opinion on McCarran's proposal to provide $1.5 billion in aid to China. Connally has received a reply from the Secretary of State.

### Zhejiang Replaces Six County Magistrates

Strengthening the County Magistrates' Conscription Performance

[Taibao Hangzhou, 25th Dispatch] The Zhejiang Provincial Government today replaced six county magistrates.

### Opening Up Navigation Rights on the West River: He Cabinet to Correct

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing, 25th Dispatch] According to authoritative sources: Regarding the former Executive Yuan's decision to designate Wuzhou as a foreign trade port and open up navigation rights on the West River, the He Cabinet will investigate and correct it after its establishment. According to an explanation from a responsible government official, opening Wuzhou as a foreign trade port is the same as Chongqing and Hankou, where customs can be established for settlement, but it does not mean opening up the navigation rights on the West River. In the past, it was misunderstood that the West River could freely navigate foreign vessels. In the future, corrections will be made through diplomatic channels.

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing, 25th Dispatch] Regarding the recent decision by the Executive Yuan to designate Wuzhou as a foreign trade port and open up navigation rights on the West River, this reporter visited Legislative Yuan member Li Yunliang, who has always strived to protect navigation rights, and asked for his opinion. Li said that the West River is a beautiful inland river of our country, and its importance in terms of economy and national defense is no less than that of the Yangtze River. Since the signing of the Mackay Treaty between China and Britain in the 28th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, the Maritime Customs, led by the British, promulgated the West River Trade Regulations, opening up Guangzhou, Jiangmen, Sanshui, and Wuzhou as trade ports, Baitukou and other six places as temporary ports, and Maning and other ten places as passenger landing places. The navigation rights on the West River were lost and became the sphere of influence of British ships for half a century. It was not until the victory of the Anti-Japanese War that Britain, the United States, and other countries abandoned various privileges they enjoyed in China, the most important of which was the right of inland and coastal navigation. For example, the Sino-British New Treaty stipulated (1) His Britannic Majesty abandoned all existing treaty rights under the "Treaty Port" system in China. (2) Abandon the privileges granted to its ships in Chinese territorial waters regarding coastal trade and inland navigation. The navigation rights lost for many years have thus been recovered. The inland navigation rights of the West River have also returned to the embrace of the motherland. In the past four years, the results of the efforts of the shipping industry in Guangdong and Guangxi have resulted in a total of 854 national ships of various sizes, totaling 56,615 tons, regularly sailing in the Pearl River Basin. The freight and passenger transport to and from Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Wuzhou is extremely convenient. Currently, the tonnage already exceeds demand and is often less than half full. Whether in terms of sovereignty or facts, there is no reason to reopen the inland navigation rights that were recently recovered.

### First Group of Foreigners Leaving North China Says Tianjin Has Become a Commercial Ghost Town; If the Current Situation Continues to Develop, It Will Be Reduced to a Village

[United Press Seoul, 24th Dispatch] The first group of foreigners allowed to leave the communist-controlled North China area told the United Press on the 24th that Tianjin has become a commercial "ghost town." Sixteen foreigners and fourteen Chinese arrived in South Korea from Tianjin two days ago on the "Hanyang" steamer. According to the foreigners, the foreigners in Tianjin have not been harassed by the communists, including the White Russians. The movement of foreigners in the city has not been restricted.

Travelers quoted communist officials as saying that they hope for foreign trade and that all businesses at home and abroad will flourish again. However, business in Tianjin is now completely stagnant. Some foreigners in Tianjin believe that if the communists can restore prosperity to Tianjin without relying on foreign aid to maintain foreign trade, the communists will squeeze out foreign merchants. Another traveler said that communist officials have not contacted foreign consulates. They believe that the Communist Party is implementing the policy of "Your government does not recognize me, and I do not recognize you."

Another traveler said that the Communist Party is still "groping in the dark." The Communist Party obviously lacks knowledge of basic principles such as foreign trade, banking, municipal management, and operating port facilities. He believes that the Communist Party is indeed working hard to make Tianjin prosperous, but if the current situation continues, Tianjin will become a "village." Communist leaders also admitted that they had failed to manage the city. Although the Communist Party has not had any contact with any foreign consulates, it has negotiated with foreign merchants. At the same time, foreign merchants in Tianjin jointly sent a letter to Dong Biwu, chairman of the North China Government of the Chinese Communist Party, stating the situation of the commercial depression in Tianjin.

### News from the Former Capital

Shops Lack Patrons, Unemployment Increases Daily; Americans Are Hated, but American Dollars Are Loved and Valued

[United Press Dispatch from This City] A certain gentleman who once worked in the press circles of Beiping, in a letter to a friend in Shanghai this month, the 14th, briefly described the situation in Beiping, saying: Beiping under the rule of the Chinese Communists has both bright and dark sides. Society has been completely renewed, and the performers on stage are beyond our imagination. The line between special people and ordinary people is extremely clear, but I admit that the new authorities are superior to the old forms in certain respects. However, poverty is visible everywhere, shops have no customers, waiters in restaurants are drowsy all day long, ordinary people are selling their belongings to maintain their livelihoods, and unemployment is increasing daily. The new authorities need manpower in every kind of enterprise, but they express suspicion towards those outside their circle. Their training period in universities is four to six months, and the level of university graduates can be imagined. Old newspaper and magazine editors are considered reactionaries, villains, enslaved, and stubborn. You often pride yourself on having friends on the other side; I advise you not to expect too much. Friends on the other side are useless. Prejudice cannot be shaken, and there is no real friendship between them and people from the outside world. We now do not know the situation outside, only the local situation (Note: In Beiping, except for two Communist Party newspapers, all other newspapers have been closed), and all foreign reporters have stopped their activities. Americans are hated, but American dollars are valued. The exchange rate between American dollars and silver dollars is one dollar to two dollars and twenty cents, and each silver dollar is worth 300 yuan in People's Currency.

Atlantic Pact Signing Date Approaching; British and Belgian Foreign Ministers Travel to America by Ship; Soviet Delegation to the UN General Assembly Travels with Them; Pacific and Mediterranean Regional Pacts Not Likely to Be Realized in the Near Future

[Reuters dispatch from Southampton, 25th] Foreign Secretary Bevin and British Minister of State Hector McNeil departed from here today aboard the Queen Mary bound for New York. When the ship arrives at Cherbourg, France, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko will board for America. Before departing, Bevin stated that he was going to America with a very important mission. In addition to signing the Atlantic Pact, he will discuss important international issues with Secretary of State Acheson. McNeil is going as the chief British representative to the United Nations General Assembly.

[Agence France-Presse dispatch from London, 4th] The British Foreign Office announced that during Foreign Secretary Bevin's absence, Prime Minister Attlee will also manage the affairs of the ministry.

[Agence France-Presse dispatch from Paris, 24th] French Foreign Minister Schuman is scheduled to leave here on the 30th for Washington to participate in the signing ceremony of the North Atlantic Treaty.

[Reuters dispatch from Washington, 24th] It was announced here that only officially invited guests and journalists will be allowed to attend the signing of the Atlantic Pact on April 4. The signing ceremony is tentatively scheduled to be held in the State Department Auditorium, which can accommodate 1,300 people, so no one else will be allowed to enter without an invitation to attend.

[Reuters dispatch from Washington, 24th] Authoritative sources here say that the United States does not intend to participate in any regional pacts other than the Atlantic Pact in the foreseeable future. Diplomats from the North Atlantic Treaty nations also solemnly stated that there are currently no other regional pacts supplementing the Atlantic Pact under discussion or planned. They generally believe that because of the broad implications of the North Atlantic Treaty, there is currently no need to conclude other regional pacts. For example, Article 4 of the Atlantic Pact stipulates that the scope of discussion among the North Atlantic Treaty nations may extend to the entire world. For example, developments in Southeast Asia, Burma, Siam, Vietnam, and other places, if deemed by Britain, France, and the United States to have affected their security in those regions, can convene a meeting of the treaty nations under Article 4 of the Atlantic Pact. This discussion does not necessarily give rise to an obligation to take action, but military action is not impossible. It is said that this is the maximum extent of assistance that the United States is currently prepared to provide to maintain world security.

### Soviet Minister of Defense Replaced; Bulganin Dismissed, Still Retains Post as Deputy Prime Minister; Vasilevsky Succeeds as Minister of Defense

[United Press dispatch from London, 24th] Moscow Radio broadcast on the 24th that Minister of Defense Marshal Bulganin has been dismissed, and his vacancy will be filled by Deputy Minister Vasilevsky. The broadcast pointed out that Bulganin will remain as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Bulganin's dismissal as Minister of Defense is the same as Molotov and Mikoyan being dismissed as Foreign Minister and Minister of Foreign Trade. After being relieved of their regular administrative responsibilities, the three are expected to devote themselves to higher-level political strategies, as all three are still members of the Politburo.

Before announcing this news, Moscow Radio broadcast that the National Congress of the Young Communist League is about to be held. The list of delegates attending the conference begins with the twelve members of the Politburo, including Stalin, Mikoyan, Molotov, and Bulganin, but one Politburo member, Voznesensky, is conspicuously absent from the list. Voznesensky was dismissed as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Chairman of the State Planning Commission on March 14.

[United Press dispatch from Washington, 24th] The transfer of leadership of the Soviet ground forces adds a further layer of mystery to the recent Soviet political changes. Officials are still puzzled as to whether this kind of change represents the promotion of Soviet leaders or contains some "cleansing" factors. The most important perception here is that the Soviet Union is having its senior Politburo members devote more time to Soviet internal problems, while neglecting foreign affairs somewhat. This move may indicate that the Soviet Union may decide to stop further expansion and focus its efforts on consolidating the gains after its post.

[Agence France-Presse] Bulganin was born in 1895. Before World War II, he was the general manager of the Lenin factory, and later served as the president of the National Bank. During the war, he was appointed as the political commissar of Marshal Zhukov. He then served as the Deputy Mayor of Moscow, Deputy Chairman of the People's Committee, and then as Chairman of the National Assembly. In December 1944, he succeeded Voroshilov as Deputy Chairman of the Defense Committee. After Bulganin was appointed as a member of the Communist Party Organization Bureau, he was appointed as the First Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Soviet and Deputy Chairman of the Union Council in March 1946. In the same year, he was promoted to the rank of Marshal.

Vasilevsky, who succeeded Bulganin as Minister of Defense, is 47 years old this year. He is the son of a poor peasant. He joined the army shortly before the revolution, just after turning eighteen. In 1940, he had been promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General, and in January 1943, he was promoted to General. The following month, he was promoted to Marshal. At this time, he replaced Shaposhnikov as the Chief of the General Staff of the Red Army. After taking office, he commanded a major counter-offensive against the German army, driving the German army from the Don River beyond the borders of the Soviet Union. In 1944, he led the Soviet delegation to England. On May 5, 1947, he was appointed as the First Deputy Minister of Defense.

### Second Phase of European Recovery Appropriation Bill; U.S. Senate Begins Fierce Debate; Republican Senators Attack Britain for Trading with the Soviet Union

[Reuters dispatch from Washington, 24th] During today's Senate debate on the $3.58 billion appropriation bill for the Marshall Plan over the next fifteen months, some senators firmly demanded that Britain guarantee not to supply military supplies to the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. They expressed deep anger over a recent speech by British Minister of Commerce Wilson.

Wilson said that Britain will never allow trade agreements with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries to be affected by political issues in the future. One senator requested that the Economic Cooperation Administration investigate Britain's trade agreements with the Soviet Union and Poland. Illinois Democratic Senator Douglas hoped that the next European aid appropriation bill could be submitted for a final vote tomorrow, pointing out that the bill must be passed by both houses of Congress before April 300, otherwise the Economic Cooperation Administration's funding will be problematic. Republican Senator Taft said that he supports reducing the bill's appropriations, but does not intend to propose reductions. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally strongly urged that the total amount of $5.58 billion be maintained, especially pointing out that the amount of aid to Britain of $640 million should not be reduced, otherwise it will delay Britain's and Europe's recovery.

### City Police Bureau Fully Investigates Dismemberment Case; Offers Reward of Five Gold Bars for Arrest of Culprit; Gardener's Evasive Words Raise Suspicion

[Report from Our Newspaper] Following the occurrence of the headless dismemberment case on Jinyi Road, yesterday marked the fifth day, and the case's details continued to develop, causing great tension. The entire police bureau, from Director Mao downwards, paid exceptional attention to the case. To swiftly solve it, they concentrated all their efforts, investigated separately, and firmly believed that a breakthrough could be made quickly. Late last night, this reporter learned that the police bureau had offered a reward of five gold bars to anyone who provided information leading to the case's resolution. A public announcement was made that if the perpetrator surrendered to the bureau immediately, the sentence could be reduced by half. Furthermore, a person in charge at the police bureau told this reporter that in the past two days, they had obtained a highly valuable new lead in the case. However, to facilitate the investigation, they would temporarily prohibit anyone from disclosing it to the outside world.

In summary, the results of various investigations over the past five days have revealed five important leads in both the "person" and "thing" aspects related to the case.

First, regarding witness testimony: Li Chang'an, who initially discovered the dismembered body (pictured, photographed by our newspaper), may still have countless details to uncover. According to this reporter's investigation, Li is the head gardener employed by the Qilu Villa. His daily routine involves irrigating and guarding the vegetables. He regularly eats and sleeps in a small hut next to the villa (about 50 meters from the knights' office). Due to recent vegetable thefts, he gets up several times every night to patrol the vicinity of the vegetable plots. According to regulations, Jinyi Road is the only way to get to Longhua Airport and the Longhua Barracks. Therefore, military vehicles pass by all night long, but during curfew hours, there is definitely no one to be seen. The police bureau has now, based on highly reliable evidence, proven that the act of abandoning the body was done before dawn on the 21st (i.e., during curfew hours). Given Li Chang'an's awareness of potential vegetable theft, he would undoubtedly get up to investigate any footsteps he heard. However, his words were evasive, and he insisted that he heard or saw nothing.

Secondly, the workers repairing the road surface on Jinyi Road. According to "Old Wang," the gatekeeper of Qilu Villa, he heard them mention that on the 19th, they saw a pedicab carrying a passenger with a package heading in the direction of the crime scene. After this reporter investigated, it was found that these workers belonged to the Eighth Public Works Section of the Second District of the Public Works Bureau. They had been working on Jinyi Road for two weeks, and the section chief was Chen Shaolong. Last night, this reporter questioned them again, but they denied ever talking about this matter and said that the working hours of the section were from 7:30 AM to 5:00 PM. This situation seems to warrant further in-depth investigation.

There is also the woman who was once seen dumping a package on the Pujiang Ferry, who is worth investigating. Because the victim's head, fingers, toes, and internal organs are still missing, if we could find out the woman's address and further ascertain what was actually inside the package that day, then this case could easily become clear.

In terms of physical evidence: In addition to the saying on the calendar discovered in yesterday's newspaper, which is sufficient to roughly gauge the perpetrator's criminal motive and schedule, the oilcloth and travel bag containing the body are also important information. Due to the texture of these materials, it is impossible to leave fingerprints. Therefore, one can only use the presence or absence of soil adhering to the outside to discern the route it took when it was brought here. The detection of the Yu Shengxiao murder case on Qinghu Road in the previous year relied on a small amount of soil on the car to determine the location of the crime. According to the police bureau's preliminary examination, there was no soil, but this matter warrants further detailed examination.

Yesterday, this reporter also visited the Longhua and Xujiahui sub-bureaus, which border the local branch. They have another view of the case: namely, that the box corpse case at the North Station and the dismemberment case occurred only three weeks apart, and the packages contained women's clothing. Both victims have not had any family members come forward. All of this can be seen as the two cases being related, or even a planned action by a certain organization. Or it could be that after the box corpse case occurred, the perpetrators turned on their accomplice due to distribution of spoils, conflict, and other reasons, leading to the dismemberment case. They further believe that the case most likely occurred within the urban area of the city. At the same time, due to the location of the discovery in the southern suburbs and the thorough washing of the dismembered body, the place where the perpetrator acted is especially likely to be in the major buildings of the southwest district. They suggested that they could cooperate with the French Water and Electricity Company to investigate the recent water consumption of major apartments. Because washing the body and flushing away the internal organs would require a lot of water, if the water consumption in a certain place on a certain day greatly exceeds its usual average consumption, then inspecting its sewage pipes and nearby sewers would certainly yield a shocking discovery.

As for the total weight of the dismembered body, the police bureau re-verified it yesterday, weighing it at 97 pounds. The woman's hair found inside the package was also properly preserved. However, in order to actively search for the victim's head and internal organs, the police bureau has decided to dispatch a large number of well-trained police dogs starting today, dividing them to search in various places, hoping to obtain another important clue from this.

### District Prosecutor's Office Examines Dismembered Body and Orders Burial at Pushan Villa

[Report from Our Newspaper] The day after the dismemberment case on Jinyi Road was discovered, District Prosecutor Wang Youfeng, accompanied by forensic doctor Zheng Tingpin and inspector Shao Guojun, went to Tongren Fuyuan Hall to examine the body, and instructed Pushan Villa to arrange the burial. Yesterday, the office issued an examination report stating: The corpse is missing the head, neck, and internal organs (because the abdomen was cut open, leaving only small organs and half a kidney). The nipples are flat, slightly brown, and the genitals were cut off, with pubic hair remaining at the root. The torso was divided into upper, middle, and lower sections, and the lower limbs were cut into several pieces. The thighs were very fat. The whole body was cut into 32 pieces, and each muscle had no blood adhering to it, indicating that the victim was murdered and then dissected. As for the cause of death, it is impossible to prove because the head, neck, and internal organs are missing, leaving only muscles.

### No Progress in Hangzhou Regarding Train Box Corpse Case

[Special dispatch from our newspaper in Hangzhou on the 25th] Regarding the train box corpse case, the police department has requested the Zhejiang Provincial Police Bureau to investigate. This reporter spoke with Director Zhou Kang yesterday about the investigation. Zhou said that the letter from a Hangzhou resident, which stated that a box containing a person was found under the Yongjin Ning, had been investigated and found to be inaccurate. They also went to the area near Yongjin Gate to investigate, and everyone claimed that no such person exists.

### Paper Strip Found Inside Woman's Jacket Sleeve Reveals Origin and Background

[Report from Our Newspaper] The most thought-provoking piece of evidence in the dismemberment case is the paper strip found inside the sleeve of the woman's jacket in the package containing the body parts. Judging from its words and meaning, it seems like a maxim and may be an important clue in the case. Therefore, this reporter searched through more than 600 pages of the "Collection of Ancient and Modern Chinese and Foreign Maxims" but found no such statement. In addition, we thoroughly examined diaries and various calendars printed with maxims, but also found nothing. Then, at midnight on the 24th, we suddenly discovered a maxim at the bottom of the page for October 21st in this newspaper's calendar, the full text of which is "人之有仇於我可忘而不可念" ("One should forget rather than dwell on the grudges others hold against me"). Compared to the paper strip in the dismemberment case, it only has one extra "而" ("and") character. We quickly took this unused calendar and inspected it page by page, and were shocked to discover that the calendar for February 11th had the eleven-character maxim "人之有仇於我可忘不可念" ("One should forget, not dwell on the grudges others hold against me"), which is exactly the same as the paper strip in the case. Subsequently, it was determined that the calendar was produced by the Hua Xin Calendar Factory.

Yesterday, this reporter visited the Hua Xin Calendar Factory and inquired with the personnel who edited the maxims for this calendar. According to them, there are a total of four similar maxims, and their order is as follows: first, "人之有恩於我可念不可忘" ("One should remember and not forget the kindness others have shown me"), second, "人之有仇於我可忘不可念" ("One should forget rather than dwell on the grudges others hold against me"), third, "人之謗我也能辯不如能容" ("When others slander me, it is better to tolerate than to argue"), and last, "人之侮我也能防不如能化" ("When others insult me, it is better to transform than to defend"). The arrangement dates were February 10th to 13th and October 20th to 23rd. Regarding the extra "而" ("and") character on October 21st, it was explained that it was an unintentional addition. However, these four maxims had never been used before and were included for this year only. The source and origin of the maxims could not be stated in detail. However, according to this reporter's research, a similar meaning can be found in the words of Tang Ju to Lord Xinling in the Strategies of the Warring States: "There are things that cannot be forgotten, and there are things that cannot be forgotten. The kindness others have shown me should not be forgotten. The kindness I have shown to others should not be forgotten."

Hua Xin Calendars this year come in ten different sizes, horizontal and vertical, and all are printed with maxims. The only difference is the slight variation in spacing during the arrangement. The paper strip found in this case was checked page by page against the February 11th calendar produced by the factory by the police officer in charge of the Changshu Branch, and the results matched the one published in this newspaper yesterday, which can truly be called a coincidence.

### Ancient Tomb in Changzhou Seems to Have Been Robbed; Expert Returns from Visit and Discusses; Believes It Still Has Excavation Value

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yang Kuan, director of the Municipal Museum, and Jiang Dayi, director of the Art Department, went to Changzhou a few days ago to investigate the ancient tomb discovered outside the South Gate, and have now returned to Shanghai after completing their task. According to their observations, the tomb may have already been robbed, because when the city defense troops discovered the tomb, they were digging trenches in the thickest part of the soil and first discovered a hole. Continuing to dig down, they exposed the wall of the first chamber, but there was no tomb roof. From this kind of sign, it is speculated that the tomb has been robbed eight or nine times already. However, the purpose of tomb robbers is to obtain gold, silver, and treasures, while the purpose of archaeology is to seek its contributions, so even if the tomb has already been robbed, it still has value for excavation and research. The Gaoqiu where the tomb is located occupies an area of seven or eight acres, but judging from the size of the tomb chamber that has already been discovered, the tomb is definitely not seven or eight acres large. There may be several ancient tombs under Gaoqiu, or it may only be one tomb, currently discovered, on the edge. Under the ancient custom of elaborate burials, the tombs of ordinary people after death would have multiple doors and layers, so the tomb is most likely not the tomb of an emperor or duke. As for its era, the Three Kingdoms period of Sun Quan is still the most likely. Among the ancient coin patterns on the tomb bricks that have been discovered, the character "五" ("five") is relatively clear and upright, while the shapes of the other three characters are unprecedented. But upon closer observation, it can be seen that they are similar to the characters "大" ("big"), "泉" ("spring"), and "百" ("hundred"), which may have been the result of the artisans' impromptu changes when copying them at the time. Although there are three types of patterns on the bricks, no matter what, their earliest dynasty does not exceed the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, and the latest is limited to the Western Jin Dynasty. The excavation work of the tomb has not yet continued. Yang and Jiang contributed opinions on the excavation methods during their trip to Changzhou, so that the artifacts will not be damaged during the excavation and their documentary value will be preserved.

### Speaker and Senators Plead with Mayor to Stay; Mayor Sheds Tears, Stating Force Majeure; Not Out of Fear of Difficulty but Due to Ill Health Making It Difficult to Endure

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Senate believes that Mayor Wu has been meticulously planning and working diligently for the past three years, and has made outstanding achievements. Recently, due to health reasons, he submitted his resignation. However, at this time of turbulent situation, it is precisely when wise people are needed to continue their efforts. Yesterday, a tea party was specially held at the Senate to discuss retaining him. After the meeting, Speaker Pan and 44 senators went to the Municipal Government to meet Mayor Wu, conveying their sincere intention to retain him in person. Mayor Wu received them in the conference room of the Municipal Government. Speaker Pan first expressed the Senate's intention to console and retain him, hoping that the mayor could think of the city's six million citizens and dismiss the idea of resigning. Mayor Wu then stated that he had insisted on resigning this time due to physical exhaustion, which was truly a last resort. He felt ashamed and grateful for the high regard and kindness of the Senate colleagues, but hoped to gain their understanding. Yesterday, Mayor Wu was deeply moved by the senators' plea for him to stay, causing extreme emotional distress. Due to a momentary surge of emotion, he even burst into tears on the spot. He said: People are all emotional animals. For the past three years, I have been able to maintain the city's difficult situation thanks to the assistance of the senators. On the eve of my departure, I cannot bear the feeling of reluctance. Today, it is difficult for me to speak in front of you all, because I have no choice but to leave.

Three Major Problems Solved, Making It Easier for Successor

However, it must be stated that I am definitely not retreating due to difficulties. On the contrary, three major problems in the city have been resolved, which will make it easier for my successor and will not cause them difficulties: (1) Economic problems: The supply of US aid rice can be extended to the end of June. This was announced earlier, and now, after my efforts, other economic parts, such as cotton, flour, oil, and fertilizer, can also be extended to the end of June. This has provided considerable protection to industry and commerce, and the city's economy can be said to be temporarily free of problems. (2) Military discipline problems: Currently, the treatment of soldiers has been improved, and there is also a solution for non-staple food expenses. It is hoped that the burden on suburban residents can be reduced, and the city's security can be ensured. (3) Municipal government revenue and expenditure problems: Next month is the peak month for surcharges. As for the issue of increasing the salaries of municipal government employees, each person has now received an additional two dou of rice per month, and efforts are being made to continue the water and electricity subsidies to ensure that their minimum living standards can be maintained. Seeing all of this, I am definitely not leaving without taking responsibility, leaving the citizens with no explanation. Moreover, my illness has indeed been difficult to bear for the past two months, especially in recent days. It has been recurring almost every morning, affecting my work spirit. As for temporarily taking leave, it is definitely not a thorough solution, because I am inherently responsible in my work and must be completely free from it. It is also extremely difficult for the acting mayor to handle affairs. Therefore, after repeated consideration, I have decided to firmly resign. I am deeply grateful for everyone's good intentions, but I cannot accept them and can only swallow my tears. After Mayor Wu finished speaking, Senators Wang Xianqing and Jiang Huaishu stood up and spoke in succession, pleading with him to stay, saying that at this time of tense situation, the citizens cannot let Mayor Wu leave Shanghai and decided to telegraph the Executive Yuan to order him not to resign.

Mayor's Face Covered in Tears, Choking Unable to Speak

After hearing this, the mayor was at a loss, unable to cope, and looked quite nervous, saying in a discontinuous tone: I have already said what I needed to say, my body cannot do it, I cannot force it. Serving the public while sick is either destroying myself or delaying public affairs... At this point, the mayor's face was covered in tears, and he was choking, unable to speak. At that time, the entire room was silent. Speaker Pan then spoke, saying: It is a fact that the mayor's health is deteriorating, and it is also a fact that Shanghai needs Mayor Wu. For the sake of both public and private affairs, we can immediately request sick leave for him to recuperate, while also telegraphing the central government to retain him, and asking the mayor not to submit his resignation again from today. It is already very late today, so we can conclude here. After the meeting, the reporter asked Mayor Wu whether the senators' sincere plea to stay would lead the mayor to dismiss the idea of resigning. Wu shook his head and replied: I will still firmly resign, because my body does not permit it.

Unanimous Passing at Tea Party to Telegraph Executive Yuan to Retain Mayor

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Senate Tea Party was held yesterday afternoon at 3:40 PM in the Assembly Hall of the Senate, attended by Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, and 56 senators. Speaker Pan chaired the meeting, first explaining the purpose of the tea party, which was to discuss how to retain the mayor. Mayor Wu's achievements in Shanghai are outstanding, and his sudden resignation has prompted people from all walks of life to sincerely plead with him to stay. I have repeatedly asked him to dismiss the idea of resigning, but he has not accepted. The current situation in Shanghai is becoming increasingly tense, and the mayor must not be allowed to resign. I hope that the Senate colleagues will exert their strength and sincerely request his retention. Deputy Speaker Xu and Senators Tang Shichang, Jin Runxiang, Jiang Huaishu, Chen Baotai, Fei Shusheng, Yu Shun, Zhao Yangxiong, Qu Yue, Wang Yansong, Zhu Wende, and others then spoke in succession, mostly expressing their intention to retain the mayor, and resolved that the Senate should ask the Executive Yuan to retain him, and after the meeting, they went to the Municipal Government to see Mayor Wu in person, conveying their sincere intention to retain him.

### US Consulate General Issues Statement Regarding Return of American Civilians and Families to Shanghai; Believes It Is Still Difficult to Say That the Emergency Has Passed

[US Information Service, City Dispatch on the 25th] Regarding the return of evacuated American families to Shanghai, the US Consul General issued the following statement today:

The Consulate General has received numerous inquiries regarding the return of American families to Shanghai, requesting clarification of its position. Some of these inquiries have been made because a small number of families have already returned to Shanghai.

Although the current situation has temporarily entered a state of calm, the Consulate General believes it is still too early to say that the emergency has indeed passed. The fundamental reasons for issuing the evacuation warning in November remain unchanged. We certainly hope that Shanghai can avoid the accidents encountered by many regions of China in the tragic conflict, but this is still difficult to say. Regardless of the outcome of the peace talks, Americans in Shanghai may face various accidents and difficulties in the coming months. Under the current circumstances, it may not be unexpectedly dangerous to come to Shanghai temporarily from nearby safe areas. However, it is still too early to say that families—especially children—can safely return to this area. The situation of Americans who remain here for pressing reasons may become more difficult due to the return of families here.

The Consulate General firmly believes that Americans will give careful consideration to the above points before allowing their families to return. The responsibility for deciding on the return of families, as with the original evacuation efforts, still rests with the individuals and families involved. When the situation becomes sufficiently clear to permit families to return, the Consulate General will issue a clearer statement. Inquiries regarding family returns have been answered in accordance with the above opinion.

### Conference Celebrating Art Festival; More Than Two Hundred People

### Re-examination of Rent Standards; Plan Drafted by Councilors' Office Not Passed by Municipal Meeting

[Report from Our Newspaper] The issue of rent standards in the city was discussed again at the Municipal Government meeting yesterday after being researched by the Councilors' Office, but it still did not pass. It is understood that the standard drafted by the Councilors' Office is still based on the three methods proposed by the Land Administration Bureau, and the city's houses are divided into six grades. The high or low rent standard is directly proportional to the quality of the house construction. In principle, the rent is still adjusted according to the multiple of the cost of living index, and the base number is discounted appropriately according to the pre-war rent. The size of the discount is inversely proportional to the original rent amount. For example, for a pre-war rent of 100 yuan, the current rent payable is 25 percent of the original amount multiplied by the current cost of living index. For pre-war rents lower than 100 yuan, it is 20 percent of the original amount multiplied by the current cost of living index. After the above method was presented for discussion at yesterday's municipal meeting, it was believed that if implemented, there would be many disputes between landlords and tenants in the future. Although there is a certain standard for the quality of houses, if the landlord and tenant cannot reach an agreement, they will inevitably ask the Land Administration Bureau to coordinate, and the Land Administration Bureau will be overwhelmed. Therefore, it was deemed necessary to re-examine it, and no concrete results were agreed upon yesterday. According to news from the Municipal Government Councilors' Office: Rent standards are related to all Shanghai citizens, and the Municipal Government will definitely formulate fair and reasonable methods, which will be discussed, decided, and announced in the next few days.

### Deliberation on the Base Price of Hairdressing Reaches a Decision; Divided into Five Grades and Ten Levels, Calculated by Multiplying by the Cost of Living Index; Base Price for Bathhouses Still Undetermined

[Report from Our Newspaper] The base prices for hairdressing and bathing, after being drafted by the two industry associations, were submitted to the Social Bureau for review. The Social Bureau convened the responsible persons of the two industry associations yesterday morning to study the matter. The base price for bathhouses could not be determined due to the soaring price of fuel.

The above base prices are doubled and then multiplied by the cost of living index. Taking the cost of living index of 1339.36 times on the 15th of this month as an example, the Special First Grade price is 4553.824 yuan, the Special Second Grade price is 3482.336 yuan, the Grade A First Grade price is 2678.72 yuan, the Grade A Second Grade price is 2142.976 yuan, the Grade B First Grade price is 1741.1868 yuan, the Grade B Second Grade price is 1473.296 yuan, the Grade C First Grade price is 1205.424 yuan, the Grade C Second Grade price is 937.552 yuan, the Grade D First Grade price is 669.68 yuan, and the Grade D Second Grade price is 401.8 yuan.

In the future, the prices for the hairdressing industry for each of the four weeks of the month will be adjusted according to the above formula. The Social Bureau has submitted the resolution method to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation.

### Police and Robbers Fight Fiercely on Hartung Road; Owner of Shirt Factory Robbed at Home; Patrol Officer Almost Suffers Fatal Attack; Three Criminals Captured Successively, Weapons Seized

[Report from Our Newspaper] No. 35, Lane 240, Tongren Road (i.e., Hartung Road), is the residence of Shui Mingde, the owner of the Shuimeida Shirt Factory. At about 8:30 PM the night before, seven robbers suddenly arrived, all carrying weapons such as Mauser pistols and automatic rifles, threatening the female owner, Shui Fan Yueying, and others, and arbitrarily looting. They were robbed of two diamond rings, six US dollars, one gold thread ring, and 15,000 yuan in cash. At that time, the victim Shui Mingde took the opportunity to jump over the wall and ran to a neighbor to borrow a telephone to report to the Jing'an Temple Police Branch. Wang Huachen and Yan Xianghu, the chief and deputy chiefs of the branch, ordered Yu Ding, the chief of the criminal section, to lead patrol officer Meng Ruisheng, police officers Yang Zhenzhong, Zheng Wangwen, Lu Changjiang, Xia Yongchao, Chen Jue, and others to rush to the scene in a police car. Meng Ruisheng bravely broke through the door first. At that time, the robbers were rushing out from the darkness. Meng immediately ordered them to stop and raise their hands. Unexpectedly, the robbers aimed their automatic rifles at his head and fired three shots. Fortunately, Meng was alert and immediately fell to the ground to dodge. The robbers fled past him in different directions, and Meng also drew his gun and fired three shots in return, but none of them hit. Two robbers at the rear turned back and ran into Lane 250. Patrol officer Meng led police officer Xia Yongchao to pursue them. When they reached West Beijing Road, because there were many passengers near the tram station, the two robbers escaped into the crowd. Two other robbers turned from Tongren Road to Nanyang Road. Police officers Yang Zhenzhong and Lu Changjiang pursued them closely. The robbers opened fire with their Mauser pistols to resist arrest, and the police also fired many shots, but none of them hit. The police and robbers exchanged fire more than 20 times. When two robbers turned from Nanyang Road to West Kangding Road, one of them secretly discarded a revolver with four bullets next to a pancake stall. Police officer Yang saw that he had no weapons in his hand and rushed forward, capturing him. He recovered the firearms, bullets, and other items, and took him to the station for interrogation. According to his confession, his name was Chen Hengbiao. A gold ring was also found in his sock. Based on his confession, the investigating police officer led the suspect to Wuzhen Road and other places and arrested two accomplices, Li Wu and Dai Youshan, that night, and seized two pistols. The fleeing robbers are currently being pursued.

### The North China Trade in the Eyes of Hong Kong Merchants: Taking Hope, Bringing Back Disappointment

— Our Reporter Zi Jian

[Hong Kong, 22nd (Shipping Report from Our Newspaper)] The first ship returning from the Communist-controlled area of North China arrived in Hong Kong yesterday. Over the past two or three weeks, ships, one after another, have carried goods and the boundless hopes of Hong Kong merchants to North China. During this period, the Chinese Communists promulgated the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Foreign Trade," which further excited the Hong Kong merchants, who were focused on "business for business' sake." However, the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment. The "facts" brought back by the "Shanghuali" cargo ship yesterday caused the Hong Kong merchants to be suddenly lost. Everyone couldn't help but turn pessimistic and filled with emotion about this business!

The goods carried by the Huawali to Tianjin included ten boxes of saccharin, about 1,000 pounds, 100 tons of rubber, and 200 dan of Yuanqing sulfide. Based on Hong Kong market prices, Hong Kong merchants were confident that they could exchange them for 3,000 pieces of peanuts. However, they only exchanged them for 100 pieces of peanuts and more than 700 pieces of other mountain products (including walnuts, apricot kernels, chestnuts, melon seeds, and other Beijing candied fruits) and medicinal materials. It was truly like a bucket of cold water poured over them, and losing a lot of money was the least of their worries.

Now, Hong Kong merchants have suddenly realized that the Chinese Communists, who tout a "policy of protecting industry and commerce," have a set of methods that seem even more severe than the government's previous trade controls! The Chinese Communists have either listed goods that ordinary merchants "dream of" as monopoly products (such as peanuts, soybeans, pig bristles, oils, and coal) or prohibited their export (such as grain, bean cake, and raw cotton), and the only things they allow to be freely exchanged are mountain products and medicinal materials with limited sales. The only things welcomed by the Chinese Communists are military supplies and machinery. As for industrial raw materials, cotton cloth, grain, etc., although they can be imported, they are subject to discrimination and cannot be exchanged for valuable goods. Hong Kong merchants are beginning to see the authority of the Chinese Communist's "Trade Bureau."

It is said that the import tax levied by the Chinese Communists is the same as the government's previous tax rate. Exported mountain products and medicinal materials are taxed at 5%. In order to pay taxes and apply for barter, goods must undergo two appraisals: one by customs and one by the trade bureau. The two appraisals differ from each other and from local prices. Hong Kong merchants have left a deep impression on the "lack of experience and ability" of the Chinese Communist appraisers and expressed great disappointment. The "valuable lessons" brought back by the Huawali have caused Hong Kong merchants to finally question the policies of the Chinese Communists and have a new understanding of the true face of the Chinese Communists.

The Hong Kong government announced yesterday the trade figures with China for February, with imports valued at 34,008,132 Hong Kong dollars, of which South China accounted for 23,330,435 dollars, North China accounted for 8,284,214 dollars, and Central China accounted for 2,393,483 dollars. Exports were valued at 23,029,271 dollars, of which South China accounted for 11,778,941 dollars, North China accounted for 7,915,269 dollars, and Central China accounted for 3,335,061 dollars. (In the eyes of the Hong Kong government, there is only one government in China, with no distinction between the Nationalist and Communist governments. North China is part of China, so trade between Hong Kong and North China is still considered trade with China and not trade with the Communist area.) It can be seen from this that in February alone, trade between North China and Hong Kong reached more than 16 million yuan, even more than Central China. These figures reveal a big secret: in addition to Hong Kong merchants, the Chinese Communists or those related to them are also doing a lot of business with North China in Hong Kong. They hire special ships to transport urgently needed materials to North China in batches and also transport raw materials from North China to Hong Kong in batches. One merchant said angrily: "Now I understand the economic policies of the Chinese Communists. They only allow themselves to make money on profitable businesses and monopolize high-profit goods. They only know that there is a Trade Bureau and do not know that there are merchants. The policies of the Nationalist Party in the past were not so selfish and arbitrary!"

According to automobile merchants, the Hong Kong market is now lacking trucks. Whether new or old, they have all been bought up by people related to the Chinese Communists. As a result, automobile parts, tires, and gasoline are also in short supply. The transportation of printing paper to North China has also made rapid progress recently. According to relevant sources, in this month alone, the amount of imported book paper to North China is already 500 tons. Including roll paper, copy paper, kraft paper, etc., the total is at least over 1,000 tons. Due to the actual needs, trade between Linjiang and North China will continue to increase in the future, but for merchants who are focused on "business for business' sake," they will have to "change course" or "look at it differently."

### Alarming Developments in the Tortoise Head Peninsula Bloodshed Case

[Report from Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 24th] After the "Tortoise Head Peninsula Bloodshed Case" occurred, rumors spread for a while.

### Is it really the world's highest peak? Jishi Mountain Faces Another Test. American explorer Clark and others proceed by land to explore.

[Our Newspaper Lanzhou Seventeenth Dispatch] Whether Jishi Mountain (Amne Machin) is the world's highest peak has been a mystery since last year when Central Air Transport Deputy Manager Chen Wenkuan flew in a special plane to explore it, proving it was a lie by the conman Reynaud. Later, as time passed, Jishi Mountain gradually faded from people's minds. Recently, someone brought up the old story again: An American explorer named Clark, went via Beiping, Baotou, Ningxia to Lanzhou, accompanied by a professor from Fu Jen Catholic University. After arriving in Lanzhou, they visited Lu Shounan, the curator of the National Science Education Hall, expressing great interest in Jishi Mountain and wanting to visit it by land; because he had read an article written by Reynaud about Jishi Mountain in an American magazine, which described Jishi Mountain as still being the world's highest peak. This trip to the Northwest is especially to explore its height to clarify the situation and appreciate the scenery of Jishi Mountain in the snow and ice. Clark also loves hunting and hopes to hunt rare birds and animals in Jishi Mountain. After obtaining the consent of the Qinghai Provincial Authorities, they set off immediately and will return to Lanzhou in two or three months.

Fleeing to Lanzhou to talk about the ancient city of Beiping.

Since the success of the Beiping peace talks, many public officials and university students who had disguised themselves and fled have come via Baotou, Ningxia, or northern Shaanxi. Wang Dehou, the mayor of Zhangjiakou, and his advisor Gao Yutian, Gao Jinlan, the major general and deputy commander of the Beiping Self-Defense Force, and Dong Bosheng, as well as a dozen or so university students, have all arrived in Lanzhou one after another. According to them, they took a train from Beiping to Zhangjiakou, a car to Pingdiquan, and then a train to Zhuozishan. This is a vacuum zone, and the Chinese Communists check very strictly at each station. Because they were disguised as legitimate merchants and carried proper documents, they were not hindered along the way. After walking from Zhuozishan to Suiyuan, they took a train to Baotou, then went to Ningxia and arrived here. It is said that students who fled from Yenching University, Peking University, and Normal University are constantly on the road, and many are stranded in Ningxia. When they talked about the recent situation in Beiping, they said that after the Communist army entered Beiping, order had not been restored, and the economy and finance were particularly chaotic. People's currency, local circulating coupons, and many small notes were used at the same time, and inflation was abnormally high. The Communist army registered people's property. It is rumored that some of Fu Zuoyi's cadres have committed suicide, such as Guo, the commander of the 35th Army, and some have fled in disguise, such as An Chunshan, the commander of the Provisional 3rd Army. Captain Gao Jinlan said that he had seen Wu Yuzhang's so-called Nanjing People's Peace Delegation. The Communist Party has about three rules for the news media in the "liberated" ancient capital: (1) Publish more news from the New China News Agency. (2) Incorrect news is not allowed to be published. (3) Manuscripts must be approved before they can be published. Afterwards, the newspapers rarely had "Our Newspaper News" and became a uniform "New China News Agency News." A Normal University student, Li Yanxia, ​​said with a smile: "There are many jokes in Beiping. After the Chinese Communist army entered Beiping, the excessive luxury of the city really made the Communist army feel like 'Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden,' with a feeling of being 'overwhelmed by favor.'"

Six "Convair" planes ordered from the United States will arrive in Lanzhou.

According to Zhao Wenbin, director of the Lanzhou office of Central Air Transport, six new "Convair" passenger planes ordered by the company in the United States have flown from the United States via Europe and will arrive in the next few days. The "Convair," also known as the "Flying Palace," is most suitable for long-distance flights. For example, if an ordinary passenger plane flies from Shanghai to Dihua, it takes four days for a round trip. If the "Convair" type plane flies, it can reach Dihua in one day, so this type of plane is very likely to join this longest domestic route in the future. The "Convair" type plane can carry 40 passengers and has eight characteristics: (1) The cabin is equipped with an automatic temperature regulator, so you don't have to suffer from the cold or heat. (2) The flying speed is 300 miles per hour, which is faster than any current passenger plane. (3) The engine horsepower is very strong, and the take-off and landing are easy. (4) There is a pressure regulator in the plane, so passengers do not feel dizzy or tired. (5) The wings are equipped with heating equipment, and ice and snow will melt immediately on the wings, without any real icing. (6) The observation holes are quite large, so passengers can enjoy the scenery. (8) The refueling is simple and quick, and there is double insurance in the cabin, and the safety equipment is complete.

The calligrapher Zhao Wangyun disappeared in Xi'an.

According to news from Xi'an, Zhao Wangyun, a famous painter known for drawing from life, was suddenly kidnapped around 8 pm on the 7th of this month, and his whereabouts are unknown. Note: Mr. Zhao came to Lanzhou last year to exhibit his works and went to Xinjiang to draw from life at the invitation of General Zhang Wenbai, with great success. Friends in Lanzhou were very concerned when they heard the news.

A two-foot-long horseshoe crab is on display in Landu.

Aquatic animals are very rare in the Northwest. Recently, someone brought a horseshoe crab from the south, more than two feet long and nearly one foot wide, which is unusually large. It has been made into a specimen and presented to Chairman Guo Jijiao. Mr. Guo considered this object to be quite rare and specially sent it to the National Gansu Science Education Hall, where it will be open to the public for exhibition in the next few days.

There are many obstacles to investigating wealthy households in Gansu.

In October, the Gansu Provincial Government ordered the counties and cities to start investigating people's wealth. The highest standard for "special wealthy households" is real estate or movable property worth 50,000 silver coins. It has been almost half a year, and the counties have encountered many obstacles. As of recently, only a few counties and bureaus, such as Xiahe, Subei, Zhuoni, Huichuan, and Hezheng, have reported to the province. More than 60 other counties have no information at all. According to reports from several counties and bureaus, there are four or five households in Xiahe County, and only two or three households in the two administrative bureaus of Subei and Zhuoni. Huichuan, a large county, does not even have wealthy households that meet the fifth-class standard (with movable or immovable property worth 10,000 silver coins). No one would believe this kind of report, but the Huichuan County Council even sent a letter to the provincial government to confirm it. Therefore, the provincial government yesterday ordered the county to stop making excuses and conduct a thorough investigation. These facts prove that the future of the renovation movement is indeed a bit difficult.

### The Reader Scholarship of Shen Bao for the Spring of the 38th Year of the Republic of China has been successfully completed.

Six points on assisted students, handling of aid funds, submission of academic works, and statements.

The list of approved junior high, high school, university and college students for the Spring Semester of the 38th year of the Reader Scholarship of this newspaper, has been published in this column from the 12th to the 16th of this month, and the aid funds have also been fully distributed. At the end of this period, we would like to report a few points to the readers: (1) Recently, eleven late applications, including Wang Chengwei's second batch of applications, could not be processed, but considering the student's poverty and excellence, and because of the school's signature procedures and other reasons, they could not be completed on time, so a special exception was made. However, the amount of aid can only remain the same, and the students will be responsible for the losses caused by the devaluation of the currency, to show fairness. (2) This newspaper stipulates that those who receive aid from other places shall not receive aid from this newspaper. If there is such a situation, it must be returned voluntarily within this month. Once found out after the deadline, or reported by other readers, in addition to recovering the principal and interest of the aid, the name and school of study will be published in the newspaper as a warning. (3) Schools should not recommend students who have already been granted free tuition within their stipulated free quota; however, it has recently been found that some schools have violated this regulation and collected the aid funds of the assisted students on behalf of them, thereby reducing the burden of free tuition, which is very regrettable! We hope that the authorities of these schools will still return the aid funds automatically, otherwise this newspaper will announce it when necessary. (4) The donations for this session were used to purchase and store rice at any time, so although prices have soared, the aid received by the students has been less affected. The purchased rice and jewelry gold must be settled in total in order to average the amount of money that more than 300 university and college students should receive, so they were all sold at market prices on the 9th of this month. (The detailed accounts have been published yesterday). (5) At that time, St. John's University and Shanghai University sent letters stating that due to winter vacation and holidays, they gave up the 16 aid quotas they should have received, and several other people who voluntarily gave up or resubmitted their applications, so the 26 shi of rice donated under the Chifeng aid project were not sold, and the physical objects were kept by the scholarship committee for the next aid session. (6) All students who received aid this session must submit theses, vocabularies, or the most insightful academic works before the summer vacation, in order to show their gratitude to the enthusiastic donors, and the joint submission method will be announced in two months. The specially approved list of second batches is now published as follows:

(Shanghai Law School) Wang Chengwei, (China New College) Shi Pinquan, (China Industrial and Commercial) Jia Zhenzhong, (Guanghua High School Attached) Yan Lanyu, Lao Guoying, (Daren Middle School) Wang Ziji, Zhao Zhizhong, (Minli Middle School) Xu Jiyu, (Chuneng Middle School) Lin Yimin, (Guanghua High School Attached) Yue Changnian, (Chuneng Middle School) Xu Zhiying.

### The Guilin Provincial Council Firmly Supports Opening Wuzhou

— Our Newspaper Reporter Liang Yushan

[Our Newspaper Guilin Seventeenth Dispatch] The port of Wuzhou is the lifeline of Guangxi Province, and the province unanimously calls on the government to implement its opening immediately. The reasons are: (1) In terms of transportation, the Sui-Wu route is 418 kilometers, and the Hong Kong-Wu route is 432 kilometers. When Wuzhou had customs, exports could go directly to Hong Kong and Macau, taking only two or three days. After the Wuzhou Customs was reorganized, exports had to be detoured through Guangzhou, Jiangmen, and other places, extending the journey to a week, increasing freight and cost, and causing merchants to suffer losses, and goods cannot flow smoothly. (2) In terms of finance, there are many advantages in foreign exchange settlement after Wuzhou is opened. Because Wuzhou is not opened, the Central Bank does not set up a foreign exchange agency here, and all foreign exchange settlement matters for imports and exports from Wuzhou are handled by other banks on behalf of them, and then transferred to the Shanghai Central Bank for collection, which invisibly increases the burden on exporters due to the different values of Hong Kong exchange rates and the loss of transfer fees and time. (3) Loss of foreign exchange. Guangdong has many rivers and is prone to smuggling. Materials transferred from the Wuzhou River to Guangdong may not be able to settle foreign exchange in accordance with regulations, resulting in a huge loss of national foreign exchange. The number of exports from Wuzhou is quite large. If it is stipulated that all export materials from Wuzhou must be settled and exported here, it is expected that the income of the family will increase.

The Guilin Provincial Council is now strongly advocating the speedy restoration of the Wuzhou Customs. The 23rd Standing Committee of the Council also discussed this issue and believes that opening Wuzhou as a foreign port, so that native products from Guizhou, Yunnan, and other places, as well as foreign goods from Hong Kong and Macau, can directly enter and exit from Wuzhou, will be of great benefit to the national economy and people's livelihood. Unequal treaties have long been abolished, and tax autonomy is not comparable to the forced signing of treaties to open commercial ports by the decadent Qing Dynasty. Internal river navigation rights are where national sovereignty lies, and the government can carefully consider them. Therefore, it is believed that opening Wuzhou to foreign trade can facilitate merchants and people, promote the prosperity of the inland economy, and promote production, which is consistent with the significance of setting up customs in Guangzhou, Hankou, and other places.

After Wuzhou is opened, transit taxes and freight costs will be reduced. In terms of exports, the reduction in costs can increase the quantity of native products for export, which will naturally be beneficial to the prosperity of commerce and the development of the economy. In terms of imports, the reduction in costs will invisibly enhance consumers' purchasing power. However, because of this, the inland handicrafts and shipping industries will also have problems. How to increase production, stabilize the economy, and control navigation rights is really worth studying.

The authorities have arrested Fan Zhongmin, the manager of the factory.

### New Finance Minister Liu Gongyun Answers Reporters' Questions: Financial Reform is Under Discussion; Last Night's Reception for the Financial Community was Said to be Ordinary Entertainment

[Our Newspaper News] The newly appointed Minister of Finance, Liu Gongyun, completed his official duties in Nanjing yesterday and flew back to Shanghai by plane at half past four in the afternoon. Mr. Liu went directly to the Central Bank office at the starting point by car at about five o'clock. Fearing that a group of reporters would gather for a collective interview, Mr. Liu first declared to the outside world through the News Liaison Committee of the bank: Although he has been appointed as Minister of Finance by the He Cabinet, he has not yet officially taken office. Therefore, all statements made in the position of Minister of Finance must be announced after taking office.

However, the group of reporters still submitted many written questions, requesting Mr. Liu to answer them. The following are the questions and answers that Mr. Liu has answered: (1) Are there any new supplementary measures for the new financial reform plan? Answer: It is currently under discussion. (2) Is there any new reform of the current monetary system? Is it true that silver dollar notes will be issued? He did not answer the first half of the question, but said that the issuance of silver dollar notes is absolutely not true. (3) Will there be any changes to the existing import and export control policies? Answer: It is being discussed with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. (4) When can the cash shortage be effectively resolved, and are there any concrete solutions? Answer: We are currently trying to gradually improve it. (5) Will silver dollars be sold in the gold market? Answer: The use of silver dollars will be handled at any time as appropriate.

Mr. Liu did not give any answers to other questions regarding silver loans, the new candidates for the political and permanent vice ministers of the Ministry of Finance, the deputy governor of the National Bank, and the attitude of the Ministry of Finance towards the north-south money transfer.

Also, Mr. Liu hosted a banquet for the leaders of the financial community in the city on the fourth floor of the Bank of China at 7:00 p.m. last night. Although Mr. Liu told reporters yesterday that the invitation was just ordinary entertainment, it is generally believed that after Mr. Liu takes office as Minister of Finance, he will have a new set of more mobile and more effective new methods to address the various realistic problems after the implementation of the current new financial reform plan, in order to supplement the shortcomings of the old plan. Judging from Mr. Liu's answer to the first question from reporters yesterday, it is sufficient to prove that Mr. Liu not only has the determination to formulate supplementary measures, but is already under discussion. However, Mr. Liu, as the newly appointed Minister of Finance, in order to express the desire to gather ideas and benefits, specially listened to the opinions of the leaders of the financial community in the city again in order to win the cooperation of the financial community and facilitate the implementation of the new supplementary measures.

### The National Bank did not sell gold yesterday, and the market was brisk and profitable.

[Our Newspaper News] The gold market trend was stable in the morning yesterday and soared in the afternoon. In the early morning, because the money supply was still abundant, it was rumored that after the National Bank continued to put a lot of pressure on the market, it had the intention to temporarily stop yesterday. Moreover, the overnight banks had a huge difference, and the industry predicted that it would not be possible to tighten it temporarily, so the trend was strong, and the intention to absorb the surface was also strong. The morning opened with a firm tone, and the initial call was to buy at 6.05 million, but no one responded to sell, and there was no transaction. In an instant, the call rose to 6.12 million before a transaction was made. Large households sold at high prices, and the market calmed down slightly, falling to 6.11 million. However, idle funds outside the industry continued to attack, and the trend outside the market was already higher than the call in the market. Therefore, the brokers raised the price, and there were many who paid the price. The market rose directly to 6.19 million. The trend was firm all the way in the middle, and there was no sign of fatigue. At about 11 o'clock, fearing that the National Bank would exert pressure again, the psychology of floating more tended to soften, and the short side was active. The intention to get out of the market was strong inside and outside the market, and the market took small steps, falling to 6.12 million and 6.13 million. Afterwards, no sales were seen, the market turned stable, and the new shorts were replenished, and the call price rose again, finally closing at 6,145,000 yuan.

In the afternoon, following the brisk trend of the previous market, the money supply was still loose, and large households absorbed secretly, and the market saw another brisk rise. The initial opening was 6.18 million, and it rose all the way to 6.25 million, closing late. The midday closing price outside the market in the morning was 6.12 million, 6.15 million, and the late closing price in the afternoon was 6.18 million, 6.21 million. In addition, the spot position was settled the next day, with an interest rate of 290,000 yuan.

The US sales bill opened at 12,700 yuan, 12,800 yuan in the morning and closed at 12,300 yuan, 12,400 yuan. The afternoon opened at 12,400 yuan, 12,500 yuan. The late closing was 12,500 yuan, 12,600 yuan. Interest will be added to the next day's position.

### The gold sale fraud is not a fact.

[Our Newspaper News] Yesterday's report said that another fraud case occurred in the gold sale work presided over by the Business Bureau of the Central Bank. According to a statement from the spokesman of the bank: The bank's gold sale has accounts to be checked, and the reports are not factual. The bank will also send a letter to the newspaper that published the news to correct it.

### Money supply is loose.

[Our Newspaper News] Yesterday's money supply continued to be loose and flat. The morning opening continued the loose trend of the previous day. The daily dismantling was about 50 to 60 yuan, and there were still many supply orders inside and outside the industry. Fortunately, the disbursement of the national treasury and remittances from other ports often arrive, and fortunately, there is a yarn settlement of about 3 billion the next day, which has a mutual offset effect. In turn, the various industries were cautious about dismantling orders due to the approaching weekend, and the money supply once showed a stabilizing trend, but the national banks continued to dispatch 4 billion yuan in the afternoon, so the supply of spot funds was still loose and flat. The daily dismantling was finally around 50 yuan.

The National Banks continued to dispatch more than 4 billion yuan yesterday, the large exchange banks dispatched more than 1.1 billion yuan, the foreign merchant banks dispatched about 900 million yuan, and the small exchange banks dispatched about 2 billion yuan.

### Small remittances to Beiping continued to be opened yesterday.

[Our Newspaper News] North-south money transfer, Xinhua and China Industrial and Commercial Banks still opened small amounts yesterday, the situation is similar to the previous day. The amount of funds that each bank counter can accept for remittance depends on how much spot funds are available for payment in Beiping. Therefore, although there are many applicants for remittance, the banks remitting are unable to accept large amounts for the time being due to the problem of settlement capacity in Beiping. South remittances to the north are also limited to small household remittances. As for large commercial remittances, it remains to be seen when they will be opened. Other transshipment banks such as Shanghai, Jin Cheng, and Jianye were also heard to have transactions yesterday.

### The Central Bank has telegraphed and ordered to purchase foreign exchange certificates in Wuzhou.

[Our Newspaper News] According to the Import and Export Control Commission, since the government decided to open Wuzhou as a foreign port, the export merchants there believe that the Wuzhou branch of the Central Bank has not yet opened the foreign exchange transfer certificate purchase business, which has greatly affected the price of transfer certificates in the area, which will hinder the exports in the area in the future. The two Import and Export Control Commissions have contacted the Central Bank to handle this purchase business in Wuzhou. The Commission believes that this move is indeed necessary and has forwarded a letter to the Central Bank for consultation, and has obtained the intention to purchase. It is heard that the Business Bureau of the Bank has telegraphed and ordered the Wuzhou branch to handle it accordingly.

### The Central Bank will set up a Gold and Silver Business Section.

After the establishment of the gold and silver market, the Central Bank believes that the business will expand, and it is necessary to establish a special management agency to be responsible for all matters. It is reported that the Gold and Silver Business Section will be established immediately, and Zhou Shunxin, the deputy director of the Business Bureau, will be appointed.

### Southern and Northern Rice Prices Stabilize, Cooking Oil Experiences a Sharp Price Increase, Miscellaneous Grains Fluctuate, Flour Slowly Rises

Rice prices in the southern market rose, while rice prices in the northern market remained stable. Because the southern market price was lower than the northern market price the previous day, suppliers raised prices. Coupled with continued loose credit and rising prices in Wuxi, prices increased by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan immediately after the market opened. Later, due to poor actual sales demand, prices slightly declined. White japonica rice was 65,000 yuan, and thin indica rice was 66,000 yuan, each rising by 2,000 yuan. There were no price changes in the northern market, remaining the same as yesterday. Total arrivals in the two markets were 5,999 shi (石, a unit of dry measure).

Cooking Oil: Yesterday, another sharp price increase occurred due to scarce supply and suppliers hoarding goods. Under speculative manipulation, soybean oil reached a high of 350,000 yuan. Prices slightly declined at the close, but ultimately rose by 15%. Raw oil exceeded the 400,000 yuan mark, rising by 35,000 yuan. Raw bulk oil and other types all increased by 20,000 yuan, and soybean cake also rose by 1,000 yuan.

Flour: Slowly rising. The market opened in the morning with easy credit and smooth actual sales. Old "Car" and "Warship" brands all rose by 1,000 yuan. Later, upon hearing that gold prices had fallen, market sentiment weakened. Old "Car" brand retreated to 24,700 yuan, and "Warship" brand retreated to 23,680 yuan, still increasing by 600 to 700 yuan compared to the previous day.

Miscellaneous Grains: Prices were mixed. Due to loose credit and strong actual sales, and with oil cake prices surging, suppliers were pushing prices up vigorously for soybeans. "Car" soybeans rose by 10%, and the asking price for the afternoon market exceeded 60,000 yuan. Raw Sichuan and newly arrived goods remained sluggish, with slow sales, falling by 10,000 yuan. Sesame, with a large quantity awaiting delivery, saw prices rise by 10%. Red sorghum rose slightly, and corn prices initially increased and then declined, with the market ultimately closing flat.

### Strong Selling Pressure in the Stock Market Forces Continued Decline in Chinese Shares

[Reported by this newspaper] The Chinese stock market continued to weaken yesterday. Various foreign goods remained stagnant, and business sentiment lacked any stimulus. Since the Central Bank began selling gold, the price trends of a range of goods have been uncertain, greatly reducing speculative psychology, which has had a particularly severe impact on the stock market. Consequently, speculative funds have shifted to interbank lending. Moreover, yesterday being Friday, the double burden of interest on old positions further intensified selling pressure. Yong Xin Yarn opened at 7.25 yuan. Short sellers took profits, pushing the price up to 7.36 yuan, the highest point of the entire trading session after the opening. Later, upon hearing that credit conditions remained loose, some parties attempted to push prices up. However, the bulls felt deeply scarred by consecutive declines, and their ambition had waned. Therefore, short sellers became active in the market. Gold merchants and securities firms also began selling, plunging the market into a sluggish state, breaking the 7 yuan level and reaching a low of 6.94 yuan. Near the close, upon hearing that the Central Bank was selling gold, some floating short positions were covered, pushing the price up to 7.10 yuan. Ultimately, short sellers released more positions, and the market outlook remained hopeless, closing near noon at 6.95 yuan. Small and medium-sized stocks were uniformly weak. All stocks opened at lower prices. Xinhe fell from 2.20 yuan to close at 2.00 yuan. Xinguang fell from 0.775 yuan to close at 0.675 yuan. Meiya fell from 2.20 yuan to 2.03 yuan. Jingfuqin and Jinglun both closed at lower prices. Taiwan Sugar opened lower but closed higher, maintaining a strong trend. Huafeng opened and closed at average levels, with little change. The remaining miscellaneous brands all fell across the board. Total trading volume for the day was 4,189,665 yuan.

### Foreign Shares Show Slight Gains

The foreign stock market showed slight gains. Institutional investors, seeing that credit conditions were still loose, showed some interest in window dressing. However, floating short-term investors sold on the highs. Near the close, signs of weakness reappeared. Yisha traded at 15,500 yuan to 15,700 yuan, up 300 yuan. British Union traded at 21,000 yuan, uniquely rising by 1,000 yuan. Yeguang had offers at 6,500 yuan, but no transactions were reported. Asia traded at 1,530 yuan to 1,560 yuan, up 300 yuan. Jardine Matheson traded at 65,000 yuan to 67,000 yuan, surging up 2,000 yuan.

The gold and government bond market remained stable. The market opened at 390,000 yuan, rising all the way to 450,000 yuan, and closed at noon at 400,000 yuan. The afternoon market initially traded at 390,000 yuan, and later remained at 400,000 yuan.

### Extension of Check Clearing Time; Financial Management Bureau Has Ascertained Responsibility

Regarding the illegal extension of check clearing time by the check clearinghouse in recent days, after thorough investigation by the Financial Management Bureau, the issue of responsibility has been reported to the Ministry of Finance for appropriate action. According to reporters, the responsibility can be pursued in two aspects: (1) The check clearinghouse's unauthorized extension of the prescribed check clearing time is illegal. The manager of the clearinghouse, Cao Jiru, should bear considerable responsibility. Furthermore, whether there are other instances of corruption needs to be further investigated. (2) Banks and financial institutions are required to submit checks for clearing to the clearinghouse by 1:00 PM every day. However, in reality, banks and financial institutions often delay until 4:00 PM or later to submit checks, which hinders the clearing process. The respective banks and financial institutions should also bear considerable responsibility.

### Silk Market Flat and Weak

The raw silk market was flat and soft yesterday. Prices of external goods were stable. Interbank lending was prevalent. Short-term investors frequently liquidated positions. Bullish sentiment decreased. Sales in the local market were sluggish. Speculative trading appeared particularly dull. No. 120 Guangxin new goods opened in the morning at 2.6 million yuan, immediately declining to 2.57 million yuan. There was no improvement at the noon close, still ending at 2.57 million yuan. Next-day settlement was 2.68 million yuan.

Raw silk market sentiment has weakened as gold and currency price surges have been halted. Although credit conditions were loose, purchasing demand was not strong. There were fewer external hoarders. High-grade Lingdan initially traded at 3.85 million yuan, then declined slightly to 3.7 million yuan. D-grade 78-uniformity white silk initially traded at 2.82 million yuan, then also retreated slightly to 3.71 million yuan.

The silk fabric market was flat and soft. Purchasing demand was moderate. Trading in the market was increasingly quiet. Market sentiment was very weak. Dacheng opened in the morning at 1.87 million yuan, rising slightly to 1.88 million yuan. After the high, many short positions were released, falling to 1.84 million yuan. The trade recovered by 5,000 yuan, and Meiya closed at noon at 1.85 million yuan.

### New Longjing Tea Prices Fall

This year's Wenzhou new Longjing tea, since its arrival in the market some days ago, had further arrivals in Shanghai yesterday, totaling about 40-odd catties. Although the arrival quantity increased compared to before, at present it is still considered news teas, hence lacking substantial shipment volume. It is generally expected that it may gradually pick up starting next week. As for prices, they have moved in the opposite direction of the arrivals, steadily declining. It is heard that colleagues are offering prices around 8,000 yuan per catty, a decrease of 2,000 yuan compared to before. The reason for this is that the initial batches to market were newly sprouted buds, and scarcity made them expensive, driving prices up. Subsequently, as more goods arrived, the quality was slightly inferior to the earlier ones, and market sentiment ultimately declined. According to this situation, further declines are expected in the future, but the trend will be softly weak and strongly firm.

Also, according to people in the trade, this year, due to weather conditions, rainfall was not evenly distributed, resulting in harvests and output of new tea in various regions that were lower than in previous years. As for the color of aged tea, in the market yesterday, with stable external material prices, it also eased along with the trend, with prices almost on par with the previous day.

### Tung Oil Price Increases Halted

Following a series of frantic surges, the tung oil trend in the market yesterday, although speculative positions were still abundant, actual sales were extremely narrow, buyers showed no interest, and external goods generally turned flat. As a result, colleagues' thinking stabilized, and the rising trend was suddenly blocked. As a result, white and red tung oil both maintained their original levels, as did light green oil.

### Prolonged Drought in Taiwan Affects Taiwan Sugar Production

[Reported by this newspaper] The prolonged drought in Taiwan has significantly reduced water resources, threatening the power generation capacity of the Sun Moon Lake power plant. There is concern among some that the production of Taiwan Sugar, which the nation relies on for export, may be affected. According to economic observers who recently returned to Shanghai from Taiwan, the province has not had rain since the end of last year. With the exception of the eastern part of the province, there is a widespread water shortage in the north, south, west, and central regions. The water storage in the Sun Moon Lake reservoir is low, and electricity conservation measures have been implemented, stipulating that factories with less than 1,000 kilowatts are only supplied with four and a half hours of electricity per day (starting after 6:00 PM). Residential electricity use is also restricted. If this situation continues, agriculture and industry will suffer severely. Fortunately, the total production of Taiwan Sugar has reached over 400,000 tons to date. Medium-grained sugar accounts for the largest portion of the products. If it rains and electricity is sufficient, factories in Tainan and Pingtung can harvest another 96,000-plus tons by mid-May. Then, before the end of the sugar production season, approximately 600,000 tons will be harvested in total, exceeding the estimated 500,000 tons. Regarding exports, Taiwan Sugar is very active in the international market. As of mid-May, Japan has ordered 100,000 tons, and the United Kingdom has ordered 50,000 tons, significantly enriching the national treasury. As for the reasons for strong sales abroad, the cost is lower, which is due to the economic stability of Taiwan, low wages, and no labor unrest. According to world-renowned sugar factories, employee salaries account for about one-third of the output. Currently, the monthly expenses for Taiwan Sugar employees are only equivalent to 2,500 tons of sugar, a difference that cannot be overstated. Also, such as the restrictions on remittances between Taiwan and Shanghai, which results in low employee compensation, and treatment that is sometimes unreliable, the authorities are strongly encouraged to improve this as much as possible. Finally, the observer stated that Taiwan Sugar factories have been working hard towards increased production since their takeover, and the results have been remarkable. Currently, it has approximately 25,000 employees and cane farmers, and approximately one million people rely on it directly and indirectly for their livelihoods. The annual replenishment of factory equipment, supply of fertilizers, and use of working capital are all provided by the Central Bank and the Taiwan Provincial Government, and does not rely on any U.S. aid.

### Deadline Extended for Factories to Collect Allocated Coal to Next Monday

[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Industry Association announces: Regarding the collection of allocated coal by various factories in the city, the Industry Association, in consideration of the difficulties faced by various factories in circulating funds, specially consulted with the Coal Adjustment Association to extend the coal purchase date. The Association has agreed to extend the date to next Monday (March 28th). During this period, all factories can purchase coal, but they must pay according to the daily price.

### Discount and Lending Industry and Mining Advisor Held Regular Meeting Yesterday

### Market Stroll

— The Spectator

The Beneficial Factors Are Not Working Anymore

Everyone finds it strange: now that credit is very loose and interest rates are high, prices are not improving, and stock prices are even more depressed. Isn't that odd?

Financial authorities listen and smile: secretly thinking that the current methods make sense.

Could it be that the current high-interest-rate policy is really preventing hoarding activities? If the fact that "prices are not improving" now is a result of the current policies, then that would be strange!

But one thing is certain: every day, the market price rises by more than 10%, and no one with goods thinks that it has risen. This huge desire that is not satisfied with a daily increase of 10% is indeed the only achievement of the current high-interest policy.

Is this achievement worthy of praise? Is it worthy of flattery? Please let the Central Bank authorities reflect on themselves!

Loose credit, high-interest rates, and the inability of goods to rise in price refer to the inability to generate enough profit to offset the interest. What is the reason for this? The reason is very simple: it's not fear of pressure from the Central Bank, nor fear of high interest rates. To put it bluntly, it's because the overall environment is not right.

In this environment, the ability to ensure one's own life is still a problem. If one were to carry a large pile of goods, wouldn't that be asking for trouble?

In the past, not hoarding goods was a big loss. Now, earning interest is not bad. It feels more flexible than hoarding goods. Because one can adapt to changes at any time, this point alone makes high-interest rates seem to have a spectator effect. But if the overall environment were not like today, then with interest as a base, the conditions for hoarding goods would be even better. So the problem lies in the overall environment, not in high-interest rates.

However, the high-interest-rate policy is absolutely correct from the perspective of the authorities' response strategy.

Because everyone is making a living by lending money, only doing paper-based business, the banknotes issued have great sales. This is the first reason.

Everyone is making money with paper, so no one is competing with the issuing authorities to purchase goods. The authorities can turn soft into hard as they wish. This is the second reason.

The shortage of spot sales is wonderfully effective in reducing inflation. At the same time, it increases the responsibility of inflated credit.

"Inflated credit" has always been a pretext used by the authorities with a straight face to shift the responsibility for inflation onto merchants.

Now, the overall environment affects some commodities in a sluggish state. In theory, credit expansion should not be possible. But tight spot sales mean that the effect is inevitable. There is also the temptation of high-interest rates, so one tries to force out loans even when they cannot be made.

This reveals a secret: the cash shortage and high-interest loans are the two major ingredients for creating and accelerating credit expansion. The sins of credit and inflation can then be diluted.

The current financial measures are truly infinitely subtle.

### Yarn Market Trading Sluggish, Cotton Cloth Prices Weak and Declining

The prospects for the yarn market are difficult to view optimistically. There are few buyers in the market due to a lack of funds. Generally, there is vigilance against the state bank selling cotton yarn and gold, silver, etc., so it is difficult to break the stagnant situation. Buyers are hesitant, and trading in the market is quiet.

42-count Blue Phoenix yarn declined from 4.25 million yuan all the way to 4.12 million yuan at the close, a decrease of 10,000 yuan compared to before. 40-count Blue Phoenix yarn was higher by 20,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon opened in the morning at 2.79 million yuan, then rose to a high of 2.81 million yuan, and then retreated to 2.75 million yuan at the close, ultimately falling by 10,000 yuan.

21-count Double Horse spot goods opened at a high of 2.1 million yuan, immediately falling to 2.05 million yuan. Near the close, short positions were slightly covered, and the price returned to 2.065 million yuan, ultimately rising by 15,000 yuan. Factory orders ultimately traded at 2.05 million yuan. 20-count Double Horse was higher by 10,000 yuan. Price fluctuations for other yarns were narrow, with slight increases and decreases as a result.

The cotton cloth market was weak and unable to recover. This was due to the mediocre purchasing demand in the local market and the lack of intent to act on the part of merchant groups. There was strong selling pressure in the market yesterday, and it was difficult to expect any good recovery in the tired situation of the morning.

Longtou fine cloth opened in the morning at the noon closing price of 84,500 yuan from the previous day. Halfway through, surface groups had risen to push sales, once rising to 87,000 yuan. However, upon hearing near the close that external goods were all flat and tired, morale was scattered, and the rising trend ultimately failed to continue, retreating to a conclusion of 84,000 yuan, a decrease of 500 yuan compared to before.

Mid-range fine cloth such as Trumpet Boy and Five Blessings all fell by about 2,000 yuan each.

Sizijun yuan twill spun from 82,000 yuan all the way to 82,500 yuan for the highest, ended at 80,400 yuan, down slightly 100 yuan, Sizijun yuan zhigong remained high at 500 yuan, shilin cloth and other color cloth, the sales was narrow, privately owned factories operational there is a plummeting trend.

### Offering a Plan for Jen Yu in Mourning for His Troops: How to Resist the League Leader Tonight?

If Jen Yu had not been defeated by Huili the previous evening, then tonight's game against Hualian would be a match of great importance, for if Jen Yu could defeat Hualian, it would be a show of strength with the same record of two losses. After being defeated by Huili, considering that this game is not stimulating enough, the Jen Yu generals must have lowered their high spirits.

However - I think Jen Yu should still value this game tonight. If they can defeat the league leader, even if they have no chance for the championship, it should still be a good thing. What's more, Jen Yu has had foreign coaches this year, and has the help of Cai Jindian, and Xu Zhong has returned. They had long been harboring this ambition, how could they become depressed because of this?

In fact, it is not yet time for Jen Yu to defeat Hualian this year. If they can continue to work together in the long run, there may be hope for the day in the next session. Even today, if I were Hualian's military advisor, I would have a brilliant plan to defeat Jen Yu. However - now I want to take advantage of Jen Yu being defeated by Huili and not being wary of Hualian to come up with a plan for Jen Yu, and to create a miracle of using a sad team.

Based on the strategies for today's game against Hualian, they will surely emphasize stability in offense and tight pressing in defense. Hualian's offense and defense are known for being slow and steady. Today, they will take a tight pressing approach against Jen Yu's defense, preventing Jen Yu, who are good at using methods, from playing their game. Therefore, Jen Yu should take a counteracting approach in offense and defense. Do the opposite. Take speed in offense, and a more relaxed approach in defense. Speed in offense avoids the tight pressing, hoping to gain a victory in stamina. A relaxed defense is not over-anxious, thus avoiding unnecessary fouls, and also reducing the opponent's chances of shooting, thus reducing points lost. If Jen Yu can do this, which I state lightly, Hualian will definitely have a headache.

In all respects, Hualian will definitely not just be defeated by Jen Yu, but the author wants to show the voice of the weak, and at the same time boost the morale of Jen Yu's athletes after their loss to Huili, and thus wrote this article. It is also to increase the interest of the enthusiasts. (Bi Xian)

### Another A-League Hai Qing vs. McLaughlin Women's Game; John's vs. Xinghua

Tickets are still the same price: 500 yuan upstairs, 1,000 yuan downstairs, and 1,500 yuan for reserved seats in the stadium. Today's games include two A-League games, one of which, Hualian vs. Jen Yu, is expected to be exciting, so it is sure to be a great spectacle. Fans who want to see a good game should go early. Reserved seats will go on pre-sale starting at 10:00 AM, and general admission tickets will go on sale at 1:00 PM.

John's - Xinghua (Women's Group) 5:30 PM

Hai Qing - McLaughlin (A-League) 6:15 PM

Hualian - Jen Yu (A-League) 7:15 PM

John's will meet Xinghua again in the women's group and take the first match of the day. In the first round, Xinghua won with a score of 40 to 33. Last week, the team drew with the Li team and led the way, proving that it has restored its strong fighting power. Although John's has three good players, Zhu Min, Zhang Luoluo, and Lin Jingyi, it may not be easy to avenge the loss.

Following will be two civil wars in the A-League. McLaughlin won the previous game with a score of 43 to 39. The team will attempt to create another victory this time. The team has been improving recently, becoming more and more courageous. It is unstoppable. Hai Qing will have a Churchill substitute for the battle today. It is said to be a capable player. It is definitely not just an average player. The two American teams will meet, and there will be many tense and exciting moments.

### Today's A-League Soccer: Longtou Meets Qingbai; Youth Cup: Yingguang vs. Pan Team

[Reported by this newspaper] The soccer league, which has been dormant for a long time, has entered a tight and intense stage this week. Today there will be an A-League game at 3:30 PM at the Yiyuan Garden between Longtou and Qingbai. Tomorrow morning, Jingwu will fight Qunli, and in the afternoon, the Mayor's Cup final will be held. At 1:15 PM this afternoon, there will be a Youth Cup semi-final. Yingguang has defeated the Public Transportation team and won the Group C championship. Pan Team is the Group B championship team. In the Mayor's Cup, they lost to China Aviation by only 1-0. This semi-final is sure to be a great battle.

Longtou was defeated miserably by Qingbai in the first week of the league. Since then, both teams have been in poor condition, resulting in Longtou losing to Zhichao and Qingbai losing to China Aviation in the Mayor's Cup. After two weeks of rest, the two powerhouses have been recuperating and preparing for battle. After the new defeat, can Qingbai maintain its winning streak in the league? This will be determined in this battle.

Since Qu Yongfu injured his foot and retired, Qingbai has lacked an ideal center and right-wing forward. The lineup is not as complete as it was in the first week. The whole team emphasizes defense over offense. Luo Shoufu is the soul of the front line. If he can have tacit cooperation with Jin Lusheng, he will still pose a threat to Longtou's defense. However, Xiao Luo is the "lifeblood" of the forward line. If he is monitored, the attacking power of the entire line will be affected. Therefore, Longtou must restrain this to suppress Qingbai's offensive. Meng Yiliang is the mainstay in the middle. Xue and Jiang's skills have improved with time. Ren Yi reluctantly serves as left inside defender, which is not his original position. It is difficult for merchants to gallop across rivers and reach far. Therefore, there is more room for opportunity in this area. If you try to storm Qingbai's solid wall from the center, it will only be a waste of effort.

Longtou's tough style has its advantages. Its offensive is as rapid as a landslide, with courage to spare, but wisdom is insufficient. Those who are too brave and strong lack planning and are easily broken. Longtou seems to be approaching this situation. During the game, it charges forward with all its strength. If it cannot break through, its spirit will be frustrated, and the situation will be greatly reversed. The reason why they suffered a crushing defeat in the first week against Qingbai, despite having the upper hand, is the same. Learn from the past, Longtou generals should not repeat the mistakes of the past. During the attack, they should pay attention to the use of pincer attacks on both wings. The inside forwards should use a calm mind to lure them to the left and attack them from the right, avoiding their strengths and attacking their weaknesses, and do not expend too much energy. Therefore, there should be contact in position for joint attacks, and do not run blindly to waste energy.

The rear defender Wang Baoshan has a sweeping kicking style. The former inner defenders have steady and reliable feet. In defense, they must find a way to restrain the connection between Qingbai's Xiao Luo and Jin Lusheng. This is because Xiao Luo and Xiao Jin have the ability to kick and break through when they see an opportunity. The so-called "startled birds will strike, flying lowly and concealing their treasures, fierce beasts will fight, bowing down and prostrating." Luo and Jin will make noise before attacking, and the defender should know how to respond. The lineups of both sides are as follows:

Qingbai

Huang Shijie

Qian Changrong, Jiang Geqing

Fu Jiutang, Zhang Renyi, Meng Yiliang, Xue Peiran

Luo Shoufu, Liu Longxin, Jing Linggui, Gu Yisa, Liu Tiyin

Longtou

Yan Chengbing, Gao Weichen

Zheng Bingyi, Li Chengxian

Wu Yi Min, Wang Baoshan, Shi Dafa

Zhang Jingen, Jiang Kun, Wang Burong, Chen Qin, Xia Shufu, Yao Qingsheng

### Central Aviation's Small Football Team Defeats Jin Kang

Yesterday, the Central Aviation Small Football Team faced the strong Jin Kang team at Longhua Airport. Yao Hua served as the referee. Chen Longquan, formerly of Central Aviation, returned to the team, greatly increasing its strength. After a fierce battle, Chen Longquan scored the first goal. In the second half, the Jin Kang team wanted to avenge past grievances, but Central Aviation's defense was solid, making it difficult for them to score. Goalkeeper Dong Jincai was particularly helpful, saving many dangerous shots. As a result, Central Aviation won the match 1-0. The team welcomes invitations to play from all sectors. Correspondence should be sent to the Central Aviation Company at Longhua Airport.

### Establishment of the Meifeng Basketball Team

The Meifeng Basketball Team was organized by Chen Haisheng and Fang Lian, who are enthusiastic about sports. Its establishment was announced yesterday at the Qishilin. The team welcomes invitations to play. Correspondence should be sent to the Meifeng Restaurant at the Stadium. The team roster is as follows:

(Leader) Chen Haisheng, (Advisors) Zhang Baokui, Huang Han, (Executive) Xu Jianhua, (Managers) Cen Yaoyuan, Ye Yunzhou, Ye Yunqing, Liu Kang, Lin Zhonghua, Xiao Mu, Shi Yuan, Lu Rong, Wang Zheng.

### Lanzhou Sports Venue Lacks Funds for Construction

[Report from Lanzhou by our newspaper] As spring returns to the capital of Gansu, all sports activities are about to begin. The establishment of a sports stadium in Lanzhou has been brought up again, but after two or three meetings of the Municipal Sports Association, no resolution has been reached. The first difficulty is the location. In the past, there were plans to use the open space in Guan Garden. The site was large enough, but there would be no way to secure spectators. The public sports field in Hongshangen has a large area, but it is far from the city center, making it unsuitable due to inconvenient transportation. The second difficulty is the cost of construction. Although Chairman Guo and Mayor Guo have both advocated for its establishment, the amount of money required is considerable, and there is no tradition of selling tickets to events in the Northwest, so raising funds would be very difficult.

Last winter, the garrison headquarters established an ice skating rink to raise money for winter relief. The results were not ideal, and now that the ice has thawed, it has come to a satisfactory end. The land for the ice rink is public property of Zhongshan Forest. In the past, there was a tennis court there, but because tennis is seen as an aristocratic sport in the eyes of the people of the Northwest, many people are now calling for a small swimming pool to be built on this land. The Municipal Sports Association has accepted this suggestion and considered issues such as water sources and funding, and there are generally no major difficulties. However, the summer in the capital of Gansu is very short, and the hot weather does not last long, so this sport may not be able to attract much public interest.

Talking About the University Student Army John Team

In principle, I should be writing about Xinghua today, but because of the photos, I think I'll write about Xinghua next week instead. Let's write about the John Team first.

This is a university student army team, and it is tied for first place with Shanghai University in this year's university league, so their performance should be good, but they only slightly beat the last-place Li team in the league, which is quite disappointing.

In terms of conditions: the team is superior to any other team, with appropriate age for sports and the essence selected from the masses. What's more, they are together every day, have good venues, and have ready-made guidance. I wonder if the team is taking advantage of these more favorable conditions?

Looking at the reality, several of her team members, such as Zhang Luoluo's height, Zhou Zhifen's activity, Zhu Min Li Miao's strong fitness, Yao Huijuan's intelligence, and Lin Jingyi's mind, are all top-notch materials in various analyses. If we add the good conditions, John should have achieved better results no matter what, but - if you take a cold look, she does have very obvious shortcomings. First, Lin Jingyi Zhu Min's basic movements are not good enough, so the guards have quick shots but lack a target, and the forwards are either too slow, or they are too fast and have no accuracy, wasting so much that they are the champions of each team, and they can't take advantage of following up, so they can't get points. Second; the team has a common casual mentality, which is evidenced by their clothing, and another example is their lateness. Although the focus is on sports and not on winning or losing, it is not a bad thing. However, it is also important to improve ball skills, increase standards and interest. I wonder what a few student soldiers think?

Speaking of coaching, it was Wu Xinyun at first, and now it's Qi Gongxiong. Although she has a coach, the performance seems to have no method at all, and she doesn't look like an organized team at all. The impression is of a rabble, each doing his own thing. It is said that Qi Gongxiong has not been a coach for a long time, and improvements under his guidance are undoubtedly expected.

Since it is difficult to discuss her team tactics, it is better to make a small comment on her personal strengths and weaknesses.

Lin Jingyi - is the theory of the team's scoring, and the top-down shot has some truth, but because she is relatively short, she is easily blocked. If she can further study how to avoid people, it would be great.

Zhang Luoluo - has a good body like Wang Shan, if she can have the ability to follow up under the basket, wrist jump rope may be helpful.

Wu Hanyun - her medium and short shots are not bad, but there are two problems. Sometimes her shots are too slow and she is blocked, and sometimes she is too fast and too far away from the basket. If she can compromise a little, she can become an ideal front general.

Zhu Min - is indeed a good striker, but it is a loss to the team because she has left her alma mater and it is difficult for her to attend.

Li Miao - She is a typical forward guard, with a strong physique and strong wrist strength. She runs enough, but she hasn't grasped the basic movements of basketball, so she gets twice the result with half the effort, and it's hard to please.

Yao Huijuan - the most outstanding member of the guards, who can grab and use her position to block people, is quite commendable. Because of her lack of experience, she has not yet reached the peak of perfection, but she is highly expected in the future.

Zhou Zhifen - is a veteran and a former athlete of the Greater China Women's Jianyu Team, but it seems that she lacks training and her performance is quite poor, and her results are only deteriorating, not improving.

Above, the author has made many comments on her team, which may be too subjective, but it is indeed with sincerity, and I wish the team, with good conditions, can get the guidance of Qi Gongshi and make progress day by day, and cheer on the athletes.

### Don't Laugh Too Soon

— Situ Shao

——Occasional Notes on Reading

After reading Bernard Shaw's books, I always feel that telling the truth is not easy.

To tell the truth, one must have keen eyes and outstanding knowledge, capable of discovering baseness beneath a gorgeous exterior and genuine nobility from the depths of baseness. But the difficulty does not lie here. What is most disheartening is that when you tell the truth, others mistake it for jest. Just as a fire breaks out in a circus, and the clown rushes onto the stage, shouting, "Fire! Help!" but the audience applauds and cheers, thinking the clown is performing a humorous interlude.

Bernard Shaw repeatedly warned of the tragic nature of humanity's future, but the response was only applause from the audience.

Applauding hastily upon seeing a superficial appearance, while forgetting the tragic implications of the facts, such people do not know whether they are laughing at Shaw's comedy or whether Shaw's comedy is silently slapping their faces.

More reflection will bring more understanding.

When reading Shaw's books, never laugh too soon. "The philosopher laughs last." Sometimes, the comicality of the facts you see is far less comical than the face you make when you "laugh too soon."

We are accustomed to baseness, so when we see something more noble, we find it laughable. Similarly, we are accustomed to lying, so when we suddenly hear a philosopher telling the truth, we mistake it for mockery.

Here is an anecdote about Shaw:

One day, Shaw went to an ophthalmologist to have his eyes checked. The doctor said his eyes were very normal. Initially, he assumed that "normal" meant like everyone else's. However, the doctor explained that normal eyes are not like ordinary people's; they are precisely unlike ordinary people's. There were fewer than ten people in all of London with normal eyes like his.

This was an epiphany for him: what ordinary people consider abnormal is, in fact, normal.

More reflection will bring more understanding. With more understanding, he will be ashamed of laughing too soon.

### New Type of Gramophone

— Yu

After many years of experimentation, a new type of gramophone has been launched in the United States, and the price is not more expensive than a wireless radio. It can listen to phone calls for you, record wireless radio programs, leave your baby's first sound of crying when he was born, and can also be used to record debates in court or speeches at meetings.

The sound recording can be kept forever without damage, no matter how many times you reopen it. It can also be easily eliminated + and reused repeatedly. It can be stored in any climate or condition without damage.

This new type of gramophone is made according to the principle of magnetization. Although it has many forms, the size of the gramophone is about the same as a desktop radio. Inside the gramophone, there are two coils the size of fried dough twists. Between the coils, there is a two-mile-long wire like hair, which can be used to record continuously for 135 minutes. The recording principle of this wire is the same as that of ordinary gramophone records.

When the wire passes through the magnetic recording head, it records the sound according to the frequency and sound. It's just that what is left on the wire is not dots or lines, but magnetic impressions. To the naked eye, the wire is no different from before recording, because it has not undergone any physical changes.

After the recording is completed, the wire is wound onto the first coil, because the wire must proceed in the same direction for recording and playback. The recorder is also a player at the same time. It's just that when playing, the head acts as a speaker, and its function is the same as that of a stylus moving on a gramophone record.

This new type of gramophone can be attached to a wireless radio. Some have automatic switches that can automatically record when a certain program starts and automatically turn off when the program ends. That is to say, when you want to go to see a must-see movie at night, and at the same time you don't want to miss a must-hear wireless radio program, you only need to adjust the automatic switch, and you can hear the wireless radio program from the gramophone when you get home.

It can also be attached to a telephone. When you are out, it will record the words left by your friends. When you get home, you can turn it on and hear the report.

### The 1949 Model Car

— Oriental Jing

Rather than calling the 1949 model car a "car," it would be more appropriate to call it a "land yacht." It seems less designed to suit the needs of the car owner and more designed to be flaunted in shop windows or color advertisements.

The 1949 model new car is huge and priced at US$2,000. Someone sold their 1941 car and replaced it with a 1949 model, but ran into problems when they drove it home because they couldn't drive it into the garage - the car was too wide and too long.

This wide and long car is designed to fit the "streamlined" goal, and it is also a psychological coercion for those who bought the 1947 model car, making them feel that they are driving an antique.

An expert said that this car is expensive, not durable, and not applicable. However, in any case, it is the 1949 model. The luggage compartment in the back of the car is large enough for you to put a piano inside.

### The Scholar is Useless

— Thunder

The threat to life is increasing day by day. However, when I look at others, they are still enjoying themselves leisurely, and the feeling that "the scholar is useless" floats into my mind again.

In fact, "writing has misled me" is just an excuse for useless scholars. When has writing ever misled him? "Dudu writing in the air" is a portrayal of bookworms who dare not face reality, indicating that he only has the ability to "write in the air." This is my experience after being unemployed.

I happened to borrow a copy of "Gone with the Wind," which was originally for leisure, but it made me discover the crux of why I felt pressured by life. Isn't Rhett Butler the richest person in this novel? His wealth is because he has a way, and his way is to see that "the rise of a system, or the collapse of a system, is a good opportunity to make money." He not only faces reality, but also sees the facts clearly. As for whether this is contrary to the morality and conscience of a bookworm, that is another matter.

In fact, since the War of Resistance against Japan until now, when have we lacked Rhett Butler-type heroes? For example, those who made money from the national crisis, those who made money from victory, and those who made money from reception are as numerous as the carps crossing the river; even those who made money from peace, I am afraid that now and in the future, no one dares to say that there is no verbal criticism. Condemnation, investigation, and punishment, in their eyes, are just "sour grapes" tricks.

Another example is the scalpers who are looked down upon by the public. Aren't they also Rhett Butler-type heroes? They grabbed theater tickets, train tickets, boat tickets, allocated rice, allocated oil, and gold, until now, they are selling silver dollars. Aren't they also seeing reality clearly and getting it right?

The heroes mentioned above, although there are differences in size and strength, all have the same ability to seize opportunities and use opportunities. According to the natural law of the survival of the fittest, it cannot be said that this is social injustice.

Now, aren't there people lamenting that the income of a university professor is far less than that of a rickshaw driver, and that the life of a public official is not as good as that of a hawker? This is a fact, but it is also a natural phenomenon of natural law. Who told you not to take off your gown and break free from the shackles of the scholar's ideas? Who did it for you? Who caused it?

I admit that I am also deeply affected by the gown concept; I also believe that if I can take off my gown, I will definitely be more capable. However, the truth is that I still don't have the courage to take off my gown.

Complaining about heaven and blaming others is a superfluous act. So, "the scholar is useless" is just a self-deceiving smokescreen.

### Little Brain Trust

— Chen Yaoguang

The wetlands of Florida in the United States cover a total of 4,298 square miles, making it the state with the most lakes and rivers in the country.

Thomas Nast first created the donkey as a symbol of the Democratic Party in 1870, and in 1874 he created the elephant to represent the Republican Party.

Four hundred and eighty-eight US dollar bills weigh exactly one pound, so one million US dollar bills weigh 2,049 and one-tenth pounds, which is a little over a ton.

### More Notes on "Hate to See You Alive"

The "Hate to See You Alive" test screening notes published in this journal on March 18 only wrote about its outline. Now, I will divide it into singing, acting, and director's surgery to elaborate on it.

First, singing: In the whole play, the Yuanban, Kuaiban, Yaoban, Nanbangzi, and Erliu tunes are all good; what is especially moving is the Daoban in "Night Complaint," "I hear the first watch of the drum again," accompanied by Wang Shaoqing's huqin, which is really lingering and sad. The singing of the Xipi Kuaiban starting from "Escape from the Nunnery at Night," "The barbarian is too hateful," and the "Farewell" scene, closing the door while starting to cry Sanban, "The house leaks rain, snow adds frost," and expressing emotions with the water sleeves at the same time, can be said to be hearty and vivid.

Second, acting: Dr. Mei's water sleeve kung fu is the deepest. Every move is extremely beautiful. For example, the hand gestures when weaving in "Night Complaint," singing "Only I, facing the lonely lamp, guarding the empty room," both hands are out of the water sleeves, pointing at the lamp with two fingers, all kinds of postures, are really beautiful to the extreme. Western dance has the beauty of the waist's flexibility and the beauty of the legs' movements. Dr. Mei's water sleeve expression can be called the dance beauty of the hands. Also, such as the dodged stick during the "Torture" (there is a special term in the old drama, I accidentally forgot it). His figure and water sleeves are all in line with the dance posture. It is the beauty of Eastern art, and those who do not have real kung fu cannot reach this point. The shy expression on the face in "Dream" and the eyes when I first saw Cheng Pengju are really as Mr. Fei Mu said: "He played the role of women to the depths of women's dance souls."

Third; regarding the director's surgery, the whole is impeccable. Such as the clear scenery of "Nunnery Night Escape," a school of elegant emotions, the round field around the tree, using the technology of the stage, integrated into the film, can be described as seamless. For example, painting, within the inch, actually has the momentum of Xunzhang. Also, such as the death of Han Yuniang, the director did not perform the evil image of the corpse falling, only Han Yuniang sang the last sentence "The moon is cold on the Quantai," and the outside of the window showed a round moon, the population was not seen, and the singing was still lingering and endless, that is, the closing scene, which really has the meaning of leaving room for endless meaning. Director Fei Mu said: "I didn't do splendor in plainness." But I think that this film is elegant and colorful, which is his success.

In short, there are too many advantages in this film. The above is just a little understanding I got during my visit, and I put it forward as an aid for those who watch this film.

In addition, this achievement was originally compiled by Qi Rushan's Yixie Ji, and its story comes from Tao Zongyi's Zhui Geng Lu. After Mr. Xu Jichuan reorganized and recompiled it, it was changed to the current name of Shengsi Hen, and it is also recorded here.

### Please Doctor Remember

— Xu Zhuozhi

We have a saying in our hometown: "Poor people don't get sick, it's like having good luck." Because I have rarely been sick, although I have always had good luck, I am not very clear. It wasn't until last week, when I had a little illness, that although I only lay down for four days, it spent half a month's salary, and I realized the misfortune of poor people getting sick.

The disease came suddenly. The day before, I came back from the writing room in the afternoon, because I was caught in the rain, and I had a little fever at night. In the morning, I felt dizzy and my head was swollen, and my face was also red from the burning. I originally wanted to drink more boiled water and get through it, but by the next day, the situation was even worse, and the temperature had risen to about 103 degrees, so I was a little anxious. Thinking about it, I had to ask a doctor this time. Let's go to the hospital to register for an outpatient clinic, but I really can't afford to get out of bed; and it's raining again, I'm afraid that if I get wet in the rain, the disease will get worse. After thinking about it, I had to ask a doctor to come for a visit.

I asked a middle-class doctor, because I couldn't afford a famous doctor, and I was afraid that a too superficial doctor would not be able to treat me properly, and I would waste money in vain. In the afternoon, the doctor came, sitting in an old jeep card that rattled when it started. My wife was naturally very anxious, and repeatedly told him the cause of the disease and the situation in the past two days, and asked him: What kind of disease is this, and is it serious? But the doctor seemed to have no interest in these things, "ummed" twice, took out the stethoscope to listen, looked at his tongue, sat down and wrote a dragon-flying-phoenix-dancing prescription, and prepared to leave after closing his briefcase. Less than a quarter of an hour before and after.

"Excuse me, how much is the consultation fee?"

"Um, 26,000, plus 8,000 for the car fare."

I heard it on the bed and was taken aback, as if I was slightly sweating from the cold. 34,000! There are only 35,000 yuan in the family.

There was no way, so I had to count the banknotes and give them to him. As for the prescription, my wife immediately took two big heads out to fill it. Fortunately, the medicine only cost more than 5,000, so I only sold one big head. The clerk in the pharmacy said that it was just some aspirin-like medicine. I deeply regret that I shouldn't have made a fuss and asked the doctor this time.

The disease is cured, maybe it was cured by this cold sweat. Thinking about it, why should the doctor be so good-headed and take so much money from others, and still have that indifferent expression, which is really incomprehensible. Is it necessary to do so to show his high medical skills?

All businesses have costs, profits, and reproduction, etc. factors, and their pricing should be based on these factors to some extent. Public utilities are one example. Then why does a doctor charge two or three thousand for a single visit? As for the car fare, it is collected separately, which is enough for his gasoline fee and more. The hospital cannot be said to be a public utility, but at least it is closely related to the lives of ordinary people. I feel that the authorities must pay attention to it. Because hairdressing, bathing, and guest meals, etc. are all stipulated by the Social Affairs Bureau, then why can the doctor's consultation fee, especially the hospital's outpatient fee, be ignored and left to nature? This is taking advantage of people's danger, and the Social Affairs Bureau should come forward to stop it.

While writing this, a friend came to talk, took a look and smiled and said: "Why are you so upset? This is still good. I have a friend who went to a dentist to have his teeth pulled. The doctor didn't say how much money he wanted, he just said: Cheap, cheap. Unexpectedly, after the pliers clamped the tooth from the beginning, the doctor shook the pliers very vigorously twice, which made my friend so painful that his eyes turned black, and he almost fainted, but he saw the doctor standing in front, holding the pliers, glaring at my friend fiercely and said: You say! How much money do you give?"

I took a breath of cold air after hearing this.

I didn't dare to complain anymore.
