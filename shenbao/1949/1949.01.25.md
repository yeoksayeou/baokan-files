### The National Army Withdraws Near the Final Defense Line, Hoping the Communist Side Will Immediately Cease Advancing and Quickly Send Representatives to Discuss Peace

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] Military observers here on the 24th solemnly pointed out that the continuous withdrawal of the National Army in the Jinan section and areas north of the Yangtze River is because the government advocates peace and aims to promote a swift ceasefire and reconciliation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Therefore, unnecessary strongholds are being evacuated by the National Army one by one to reduce unnecessary losses. However, the government's intention is to seek peace, not surrender. Such measures to avoid unnecessary conflict also have their limits. The Yangtze River is the National Army's final defense line. To protect Jiangnan, the National Army must retain some strongholds north of the river. As of the evening of the 24th, the National Army had withdrawn to areas near the final defense line. If the communists continue to advance, war will likely be unavoidable. Since the Executive Yuan's resolution on the 19th to suggest a ceasefire and reconciliation, the government has, in fact, taken ceasefire measures and has already appointed representatives to prepare for peace talks with the Communist side. Although the Communist side insists that peace talks need not stipulate ceasefire conditions beforehand, we have now made the greatest effort to promote peace. It is hoped that the Communist army will immediately cease advancing and use the areas from which the National Army has withdrawn as a buffer zone, and quickly send representatives to negotiate. Then, peace can be achieved quickly.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] In the past week, the National Army has been withdrawing south daily, possibly completely realizing the situation of facing each other across the river, defending the Yangtze and not defending the Huai, before the Lunar New Year's Eve. Although the mood of the capital's residents is heavy, everyone hopes that this "period of transitional suffering" will pass as soon as possible.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] The Capital Garrison Headquarters, considering that the Communist army north of the Yangtze River is approaching the Yangtze River, has specially established a Shipping Control Office to control all types of ships along the river between Wuhu and Zhenjiang. Deng Yunyi has been appointed as the director, and the office will start working in Xiaguan today.

[This Newspaper, Nantong, 24th Dispatch] To ensure safety, the Nantong County government has established a Jiangnan Office in the Liu Hai district on the south bank of the Yangtze River. In addition, the local garrison authorities have mobilized civilians to build city defenses.

[United Press, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] According to unconfirmed reports, Acting President Li has today transferred 50,000 men from Chongxi's command here, presumably to prevent the National Army from violating future ceasefire agreements or, in the event of a Communist offensive, to protect the capital.

### Southern Section of the Jinpu Railway Front: The Two Armies Face Each Other Across the Chu River; Yangzhou is Fortified, and the Situation in Yizheng is Improving

[This Newspaper, Puzhen, 24th Dispatch] To implement the established policy of ensuring Jiangnan, the National Army, except for some bridgeheads in the north of the Yangtze River, continues to withdraw south according to the planned schedule. Therefore, there have been few major contacts on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway front, the Huainan Road, and the Huaiyang Highway in recent days. Among them, the Chu County area of ​​the Jinpu Railway is responsible for covering the retreat south from Danzi Station. At noon on the 24th, this unit encountered a part of the Communist 12th Column and the Jianghuai Military Region Independent Brigade five miles north of Niaoyi, repelled them, and then retreated to the south of Dongge, forming a confrontation with the Communist army across the Chu River. In addition, after more than 10,000 Communist troops entered Chu County, they advanced towards Quanjiao via Meijiapu and Yaopu at 2:00 PM on the 24th. The National Army Hu Changqing's troops have given a strong resistance, and the battle is still going on outside the city. As for Liuhe, the National Army voluntarily abandoned it on the afternoon of the 23rd. As for Yangzhou, when a long-distance call was made to the city at 2:30 PM on the 24th, it was still fortified by two regiments of the National Army's regular army and one regiment of local troops. In addition to contact with thousands of local communists, the main force of the two Communist columns has not yet participated in the battle.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] The Communist army that entered Liuhe was the 12th Column of Chen Yi's forces. Chen Yi's 10th, 11th, and 12th Columns also gathered northeast of Yangzhou on the 24th and engaged in fierce fighting with our army. Until 7:00 PM, Yangzhou was still in the hands of our army. The National Army on the Chu County front has now withdrawn south, retreating to the south of the Chu River. Hexian is still being built into a bridgehead north of the Yangtze River by the local security regiment and has not been abandoned.

[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 24th Dispatch] After the National Army transferred from Wanfu Bridge, fifteen miles east of Yangzhou, on the 23rd, the rail bridge was blown up. After our reinforcements arrived in Yizheng on the 24th, the situation improved.

Yesterday, she made an exception to receive Gan and provided several suggestions for conducting peace, instructing him to convey them to the government.

### The President Quietly Resides in His Hometown, Enjoying Family Happiness; He Plans to Prepare a New Year's Eve Dinner with His Clan on New Year's Eve

[Central News Agency, Xikou, 24th Dispatch] After President Chiang retired and returned to his hometown, he quietly resided at the mausoleum of his mother, Mrs. Chiang, without receiving any guests. He spent his days with his family, including Chiang Ching-kuo and his wife, as well as grandchildren, enjoying family happiness. The President took a walk near the mausoleum this morning, enjoying the scenery and appearing very happy. The President has participated in the revolution for several decades, working tirelessly, and has never returned to his hometown for the New Year. This time, he retired and returned to his hometown for a quiet residence, coinciding with the end of the year. He specifically planned to prepare a New Year's Eve dinner at the old residence of Fenghao House, to enjoy a chat with his clan. The local elders and members of the Chiang clan also consider it rare for the President to return to his hometown for the New Year and are preparing to perform operas and welcome lights during the Spring Festival to express their sincere welcome.

### Li Jishen and Others' Statement Does Not Hinder Peace Talks

[This Newspaper Report] Since Li Jishen, Shen Junru, and 53 others issued their opinions on the current situation, people in society have held pessimistic views on the prospects for peace talks. Yesterday, the reporter specifically inquired about the significance of this matter with Gan Jiehou. According to Gan, the results of research with various parties all believe that this declaration was written before Mr. Chiang's retirement, so it only mentioned the New Year's Day proclamation, and did not mention the situation after his retirement. Therefore, it is believed that the publication of this declaration does not hinder the progress of peace talks. Gan also believes that although the Communist offensive has not stopped, military actions will actually cease once peace talks begin. The reporter then asked whether the Peiping ceasefire agreement could be a microcosm of a future peace agreement. Gan believes that this is unlikely, because the former is local, and the latter is comprehensive, so they cannot be compared. The conditions of the Communists cannot exceed the eight points they have proposed, and the government will also put forward proposals, and the eight points are the basis for negotiations, which does not mean full acceptance.

[United Press, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] Acting President Li held a tea party on the 24th to receive diplomatic envoys from various countries.

[This Newspaper, Peiping, 24th, 5:17 PM Dispatch] After the Peiping peace agreement was signed, both sides earnestly performed their duties. The Communist army outside the city withdrew 30 miles from its original positions, and the National Army inside the city also successively received orders to move to designated areas.

It is learned that after the National Army arrives at its new station, it will be reorganized in about a month.

[This Newspaper, Peiping, 24th Dispatch] According to those familiar with the matter, the Joint Office, which handles the military and political affairs of Peiping during the transition period under the ceasefire agreement, has actually begun working. It is said that the military transition period is one month, and the political transition period is shorter. Currently, the Hebei Provincial Government and the Peiping Municipal Government are sorting out files and sundries in preparation for handover.

[This Newspaper, Peiping, 24th Dispatch] The signs that Peiping will become the center of peace talks have not yet been confirmed by more information today.

[This Newspaper, Peiping, 24th Dispatch] There are many signs of comprehensive peace talks in Peiping. It is rumored in Peiping that Li Jishen has arrived in Shijiazhuang and may come to Peiping after the situation in the old capital is clarified. Furthermore, sources familiar with the matter report that Communist Chairman Mao Zedong will also come to Peiping soon.

[This Newspaper, Peiping, 24th, 6:55 PM Dispatch] After the Peiping peace agreement was signed, the issue of "war criminals" still attracted attention. According to an important official source, the war criminals issue will disappear after the state of war no longer exists.

[United Press, Peiping, 24th Dispatch] The National Army's withdrawal work was completed last night. According to the ceasefire agreement, only a part remains to guard warehouses or assist the police. There is currently a regiment of the Communist army in the city without flags. Its main task is to protect Communist officials. The handover is proceeding smoothly. The Communist representative of the Joint Office is temporarily represented by Xue Zizheng, Ye Jianying's chief of staff. The government representative is Fu Zuoyi. The Office has ordered that civilian aircraft be prohibited from entering or leaving, and several government air force planes are also under its jurisdiction. It is hoped that rail transport between Peiping and Tianjin will return to normal within days. Except that it is necessary to find ways to cross several bombed bridges along the way, it is not difficult for any traveler to travel directly from Peiping to Harbin. According to the Communist authorities, the section of the Ping Sui Railway from Peiping to Zhangjiakou has been repaired and is expected to open to traffic soon. Food from the surrounding countryside is being continuously transported into the city. A 49-pound bag of flour, which was priced at 1,400 yuan a few days ago, has now fallen to 600 yuan.

### Acting President Li Telegraphed Yesterday, Inviting Gu Mengyu and Others to Visit Nanjing

[This Newspaper, Hankou, 24th Dispatch] It is learned that Huang Shaohong did leave Hankou five days ago, and his whereabouts are unknown.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] Minister of Water Conservancy Zhong Tianxin, having been appointed as a representative for peace talks, has had his request approved by the Executive Yuan to have the affairs of the Ministry of Water Conservancy delegated to Vice Minister Wang Peiren.

[United Press, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] Officials here, from Acting President Li down, have apparently accepted the status of a defeated party in spirit and are willing to pay any price for peace short of unconditional surrender. Their greatest hope is to gain equal status with the Communist Party in a coalition government, but if a ceasefire agreement similar to that in Peiping is acceptable for the entire solution, it would not be surprising if the government's peace initiators agree to a minority party status in a coalition government. Many believe that this is very possible because the "honorable peace" advocated by President Sun Ke in the highest-level discussions has been transformed into "peace on the best possible terms."

[United Press, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] Government officials announced on the 24th that although the Communist telegrams continue to attack the Nanjing government, it is expected that the Communist Party will accept the peace proposal. According to unconfirmed reports, the CCP has designated Peiping as the site for peace talks and has appointed Zhou Enlai as the chief representative of the Communist side.

It is heard that the release of political prisoners was listed as one of the terms of the agreement. However, it is found that most of those who are imprisoned for political cases are still groaning under iron bars and living inhuman lives. Speaking of this, how can we bear our grief? It is hoped that you, the directors, will practice your promises.

### The Beginning of Cooperation Among Asian Peoples

The conference of nineteen Asian nations, which opened in New Delhi on the 20th, successfully concluded on the 23rd. Although the conference period was brief, it completed its initial task and achieved a good start for the self-help and mutual assistance of Asian countries. As Indian Prime Minister Nehru, the initiator of the Asian Conference, said, "This Asian Conference is indeed the forerunner of a new era of cooperation among the peoples of the Far East."

Summarizing the themes discussed at this Asian conference, they are nothing more than the following two: one is the new situation caused by the Dutch invasion of Indonesia and the countermeasures to be taken, as proposed by Indian Prime Minister Nehru; and the other is the Asian regional security mechanism proposed by Philippine representative Romulo. During the four days of the conference, representatives from the nineteen countries expressed their opinions one after another. Because of the consistency of their positions and the similarity of their interests, no disputes occurred, and agreements were reached through consultation, which is a rare phenomenon in any international conference.

Regarding the resurgence of the Dutch-Indonesian conflict, although world opinion has unanimously condemned the Dutch atrocities against Indonesia, and the United Nations Security Council has also demanded that the Netherlands immediately cease its military operations; however, the Dutch authorities have consistently refused to abandon their "colonialism" towards Indonesia, and still want to carry out their imperialist policies under the smoke screen of "anti-communism," blatantly ignoring the accusations of world opinion and the resolutions of the Security Council. If the relevant Asian countries stand idly by and do not take "effective action," it will be difficult to see a thorough resolution of the Dutch-Indonesian issue. Indian Prime Minister Nehru, angered by the Dutch tyranny in Indonesia, and also to save the crisis in Southeast Asia, specifically initiated the convening of a conference of nineteen Asian countries, in order to assist the United Nations Security Council in resolving this issue through self-help and mutual assistance. In Nehru's initial proposal, he put forward two steps to resolve the Dutch-Indonesian dispute. The initial goal was to restore the Republic of Indonesia to the state before the Dutch army attacked Yogyakarta, so that the country could negotiate with the Netherlands in the position of a free government. The second step was to eradicate colonialism by other countries in Asia, so that all countries in the world would know that Asia would never tolerate other countries interfering with its freedom. However, in the eyes of the Indonesian representatives, Nehru's proposal was still too slow, so they demanded that Asian countries impose effective sanctions on the Netherlands to force the Netherlands to withdraw from Indonesia. The final result of the discussion was a decision to recommend that the United Nations Security Council demand that the Netherlands end its rule over Indonesia, and to condemn the Dutch military actions against Indonesia as nothing less than a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter and a threat to peace in Southeast Asia and the entire world.

In addition to this general resolution, ten specific measures were also decided: (1) The Netherlands should immediately release all Indonesian political leaders; (2) The Republic of Indonesia should restore its jurisdiction over Java, Sumatra, and other regions before March 15; (3) Yogyakarta should be restored as the capital of the Republic of Indonesia; (4) Indonesian people should be allowed freedom of movement throughout the country; (5) The Netherlands should completely withdraw from the occupied areas under foreign supervision before March 15; (6) All trade restrictions should be lifted, and Indonesian people should be allowed to freely interact with all countries in the world; (7) The Indonesian provisional government should be formed before March 15; (8) All troops should be under the jurisdiction of the provisional government, and the Dutch army should withdraw from the entire East Indies on a designated date; (9) The work of convening a constitutional assembly should be completed before November 1; (10) Sovereignty should be transferred to the Indonesian government on January 1 of next year. These ten measures are thorough and comprehensive, and it is hoped that Asian countries will work together to promote their realization one by one; moreover, whether these ten measures can be fully achieved is also a major test of whether Asian countries can cooperate and help each other.

In terms of a permanent regional security mechanism in Asia, the high-pitched advocacy of an Asian alliance today has its profound meaning. Although this Asian conference did not have a concrete resolution, it only agreed to request the governments of the participating countries to study the possibility of organizing a regional security mechanism for Asian countries within the framework of the United Nations; however, the awakening of the Asian people and their desire for unity have formed an irresistible mainstream in the New Delhi Conference, making it impossible for any world power to ignore. When Philippine representative Romulo spoke, mentioning that "after centuries of bondage, Asia is now casting off its chains and striving for its new freedom and power, let us work together to help Asia obtain the rightful place it deserves in the new world," he received warm applause from the entire audience. This call from New Delhi is indeed the harbinger of the arrival of the Asian century, worthy of the attention of the great powers. Even more worthy of our cherishing!

### Hoffman to Meet Acheson to Request Instructions on Aid to China; U.S. Government Action Hinges on Outcome of KMT-CCP Peace Talks

[United Press, Washington, 24th] Economic Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman announced today that he will ask Secretary of State Acheson for instructions on future aid to China, likely this week. This move has been agreed to by Acheson. Unless the State Department formulates a new China policy, the Economic Cooperation Administration will not change its current $275 million aid to China plan. However, the U.S. government's actions largely depend on the outcome of the peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, with the following three possibilities: (1) If the KMT and the CCP divide the north and south, continue to aid the government-controlled areas. (2) Negotiate with the future Communist government or a government partially communist, but this move must be approved by the State Department. (3) Completely stop aid to China.

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] According to the general opinion here, China will be the most difficult problem for the new U.S. Secretary of State Acheson. However, well-informed sources believe that there is little prospect of major developments in U.S. policy toward China for the time being. Authorities here announced on the 23rd that if the current chaotic situation in China remains unchanged, the U.S. will still adhere to a policy of non-intervention, but if a coalition government or a communist regime is established, the U.S. will take measures to adapt to the new situation.

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 22nd] Recent developments in China, such as President Chiang's retirement, Vice President Li's inauguration, the appointment of a five-member delegation to negotiate peace with the Communist Party, and the ceasefire in Beiping, are all headline news in Pacific coast newspapers and broadcasts.

### Talking about Fuzhou Amidst Evacuation

— Our Reporter Zheng Shizhu

[Our Fuzhou Dispatch by Air Mail on the 21st] In the early stages of the evacuation, people's attention was focused on the beautiful island of Taiwan. But as the evacuation neared its end, tens of thousands of people surged in, and this provincial capital on the edge of the sea greeted them with a mixture of surprise and joy.

The Navy came, the Air Force came, the Quzhou Pacification Headquarters was abolished, but the Fuzhou Pacification Headquarters was established. The number of officials often did not match the number of their family members, so the Air Force Supply Division and the Ground Service Squadron, plus their families, amounted to about 4,000 people. Many of the officers and soldiers serving in the Navy were from Fuzhou, and the number of their families returning to Fuzhou was certainly more than that. Together with others evacuated from various places through various connections and by various public and private means of transportation, it is estimated that the population of Fuzhou City and its suburbs has increased by at least 40,000 in the recent period. Fuzhou's population is said to be 300,000, which has increased by one-seventh. More conspicuously, most of these additional people are non-producers, but their purchasing power is stronger than that of the average local. In the past half month, Fuzhou's sea, land, and air transportation has been more frequent and larger in scale than ever before, with as many as 24 special planes landing in one day and as many as 80 small naval vessels entering port at one time. At present, various evacuation agencies are still arriving in Fuzhou one after another, and the population is still increasing rapidly.

In the past half month, commodity prices have stirred up a huge storm. The price of rice once shouted to 3,000 yuan on the 16th, a 12-fold increase in ten days, which is particularly daunting. The price of pork rose from 30 yuan per catty to 96 yuan in ten days, and the citizens looked at each other in dismay as the Lunar New Year approached. This round of price increases was led by rice, which instantly surpassed Beijing and Shanghai. It is said that it was impacted by the influx of speculative capital from the south, especially the hoarding of rice, which was the main stimulus. Amidst the sharp rise in prices, there was even a situation similar to panic buying. Nine out of ten oil markets were empty, and the oil tanks were as clean as if they had been washed. Even if there were some reserves, they were unwilling to sell them in large quantities. After the news of peace spread, although the prices of various goods fell slightly, people were still mostly waiting and watching.

### The Democratic Liberal Party Gains an Advantage in the General Election: Yoshida Likely to Continue as Prime Minister; The Communist Party's Startling Rise: Seats in Parliament Increase to Thirty-Five; Most Leaders of the Social Democratic Party Fail to be Elected

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th Dispatch] Japan is likely to produce a one-party cabinet of conservatives after yesterday's election, as the Democratic Liberal Party holds an absolute majority of 263 seats in the new parliament, according to the election results. Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida will certainly continue in office after the parliament convenes on February 15. The final election results are as follows:

Democratic Liberal Party: 263 seats (152 seats in the old parliament)

Democratic Party: 70 seats (90 seats in the old parliament)

Social Democratic Party: 49 seats (111 seats in the old parliament)

Communist Party: 35 seats (4 seats in the old parliament)

People's Cooperative Party: 14 seats (19 seats in the old parliament)

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th, Associated Press] The extreme conservative Democratic Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida, has apparently won an absolute majority in the Japanese parliament. The Communist Party has demonstrated its startling strength in this general election. In this largest-ever election, the Japanese people have effectively abandoned all middle-of-the-road parties.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th Dispatch] Most of the leaders of the Social Democratic Party failed in this election. According to incomplete vote counting, the party chairman Tetsu Katayama, former Deputy Prime Minister Suehiro Nishio, former Minister of Labor Kanji Kato, and his wife Shizue Kato, former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Katsu Nozomi of the Katayama Cabinet, and former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Kazuo Nagae of the Ashida Cabinet, all failed in yesterday's election.

Nosaka predicted that the number of seats in the Japanese Communist Party will increase further.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 24th Dispatch] Prime Minister Yoshida's extremely conservative Democratic Liberal Party has apparently won an absolute majority of seats in the House of Representatives in the general election, enabling him to confront the Communist Party, even if the party becomes the largest party in Japan. Yoshida admitted at a press conference that he was surprised by the strength shown by the Japanese Communist Party in the election. Yoshida said that he planned to organize a "cabinet of action" to cooperate with MacArthur's nine-point economic plan.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th Dispatch] MacArthur issued a statement commenting on the results of the Japanese election, saying: "The people of the free world can be satisfied with this enthusiastic and orderly election in Japan. This election in Japan, held at a time when the history of Asia is rising and waning, shows that conservative government thinking has gained clear and decisive approval."

### Togliatti Comments on Truman's Speech: Peace is Not Difficult to Achieve if the United States Desires it

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 23rd Dispatch] Italian Communist Party Secretary Togliatti mentioned President Truman's inauguration speech at a meeting here today, saying that he had an impression that "the American people's desire for peace is beginning to be noticed." And American leaders must take this desire into account. He continued, "If the United States wants peace, it will be easy to reach an agreement. It is absurd to say that Moscow is launching a peace offensive, because the Soviet Union has always demanded peace, and our party has also been constantly striving for peace, and today we are doing our best to strengthen our actions against the war policy."

MacArthur said: "I am deeply grateful for the gathering of my compatriots to celebrate my humble birthday, which shows the depth of friendship and love. At the same time, it also shows the determination of the American people to promote Americanism, which has been harmed by enemies at home and abroad, who have caused unrest and turmoil through misunderstanding and deception in order to undermine the traditional unity of the American people. Standing at an outpost far from the American coast, seeing that the Asian continent is being threatened by communism, I am given a lot of strength and courage by the trust and support of my compatriots. Although I cannot estimate the military strength, I dare to guarantee that this outpost of democracy and freedom will never succumb to the political or social pressure of communism or any other enslaving ideology, no matter how the situation on the neighboring continent changes."

### Encouraged by the Asian Conference, the Security Council Will Take Stern Action Against the Netherlands: Representatives of Several Countries Will Submit Amendments Today

[United Press, Lake Success, 23rd Dispatch] Sources close to the US delegation said today that the resolution on the Dutch-Indonesian issue submitted by the Southeast Asian Conference to the United Nations Security Council has strengthened the Security Council's position in dealing with the issue. But a group of countries with great potential should take more severe action, and the resolution seems to be too moderate. It is expected that when the Security Council resumes its discussion of the Indonesian issue tomorrow, the delegations of several countries, encouraged by the Asian Conference, will submit amendments to the joint proposal of China, the United States, Norway, and Cuba. However, any tough amendment is unlikely to obtain the necessary majority.

### The Iranian Government Feels Uneasy About the Turbulent Situation in China: Believes it May Become "China's Second" in the Future

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 23rd Dispatch] The retreat of China's President Chiang has caused unease in government circles here, as communism is expanding day by day. It is unknown to what extent the countries on the continent can rely on US aid, and what attitude the United States will take if Iran is in the same situation as China. The semi-official newspaper "Tehran Daily" commented today on the possibility of the Communist Party directly threatening Iran, saying that government circles are now divided into two factions on the issue of US opposition to the expansion of communism. One faction believes that the US government is now shortening the anti-Soviet front, but is also preparing to defend the Middle East, which is most evident in the policies pursued by the United States in Turkey and Palestine. The other faction holds a skeptical attitude and is awaiting the return of the US Ambassador to Iran, Wiley, before deciding on its opinion. The newspaper also said that the development of the situation in China is the Soviet Union's most significant victory, and Iran may become "China's Second" in the future. Finally, it said that what distinguishes Iran from China is that all provinces of Iran are directly under the central government. The changes in China are sufficient to support the general trend of the Iranian government, namely, maintaining a good neighbor policy, promoting internal reforms, and trusting the United Nations organization.

[Report from Our Newspaper] New York, 24th Broadcast: Paris News: After several consultations between the French government and Fischer, the chief representative of Israel in France, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a communique today formally announcing its decision to recognize the Israeli government de facto.

[Associated Press, London, 23rd Dispatch] It is reported that the British Cabinet will make a final decision on the recognition of the provisional government of Israel on the 24th. It is generally believed that Britain's recognition of Israel is a foregone conclusion. It is generally believed that British Prime Minister Attlee and his cabinet leaders will make a decision at their official residence at 10 Downing Street on the 24th. Britain is already discussing the recognition of Israel with Australia and New Zealand. Australia and New Zealand have indicated that they will follow suit once Britain recognizes Israel. At the same time, France may also follow Britain in recognizing Israel. Political circles suggest that Britain will likely announce it before the 25th, as this move will benefit the conservative elements in Israel.

### Acheson Begins Work: Is Personally Planning the North Atlantic Defense Treaty; It is Reported that Acheson Will Soon Consult with Various Countries

[US Information Agency, Washington, 22nd Dispatch] Secretary of State Acheson began work early this morning at his desk. He acknowledged that this work would entail great responsibility. When the new Secretary of State was asked to make a statement in a newsreel, he said: "I have been instructed by the President, and I know that the task is arduous and the responsibility is heavy. I vow to fulfill these responsibilities with loyalty."

[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd Dispatch] Well-informed diplomatic sources predicted on the 23rd that the new Secretary of State Acheson will immediately take over as the US representative for the negotiation of the North Atlantic Security Alliance. Acheson has already received the documents of the plan from State Department officials and is expected to proceed with this matter first. The plan will unite the United States, Canada, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg into an alliance to prevent aggression - in fact, to protect Western Europe from aggression by the Soviet Union and its satellite countries. As drafted, the plan stipulates that signatory countries should consult promptly on the definition of aggression or the threat of war. The US Congress will retain the right to decide what action the United States should take. This provision reaffirms that the US Congress alone has the power to declare war, and is intended to alleviate the concerns of some senators and representatives who have vehemently opposed the treaty until this guarantee is given. The treaty will require the approval of the US Senate and may be submitted to the Senate on February 15. It is rumored that Acheson and other foreign ministers of the signatory countries will hold a meeting soon to sign the treaty. The meeting may be held in Bermuda.

### British Newspaper Comments on the New Delhi Conference: Believes That the Netherlands' Plan to Establish a Federal Government in Indonesia is a Wise Move. The Suspicions of All Parties Towards the Netherlands Will Eventually Be Eliminated.

[British Information Service, London, 23rd Dispatch] The British Times wrote an evaluation on the New Delhi Conference today, stating: "When representatives of 19 countries met in New Delhi to consider the Dutch actions in Indonesia, Nehru made a cautious statement in his opening speech, saying that the purpose of the meeting was to strengthen the Security Council's strength, rather than to establish a hostile Asian group to protect Asian interests. The countries participating in the meeting, from Egypt and Ethiopia in the west to Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines in the east, as Australian Foreign Minister Evatt called it, all felt a desire to see the Security Council's orders obeyed by Indonesia, and throughout Southeast Asia, relations between Western countries and the nationalism that is unfolding among Asian people should be promoted by the United Nations Charter rather than by older ideas of racial dominance. "It is remarkable that the countries of the Eastern Hemisphere, regardless of their different cultural and economic backgrounds, can work together closely to support the ideals set forth in the United Nations Charter. The participation of all five British dominions of different natures—New Zealand, Australia, India, Pakistan, and Ceylon—undoubtedly strengthens the belief in the meeting that this kind of cooperation is possible. All indications have shown that the current crisis in Indonesia may change the entire Southeast Asia, as this crisis can make the Asian people believe that racial ties are not as important as ideals, and that the true foundation of international cooperation is the principle of freedom and justice." "Since the majority of countries at the New Delhi Conference considered the Netherlands' actions in the Dutch East Indies to be close to the use of force to suppress legitimate nationalist movements, it is hardly surprising that the Dutch government was severely attacked at the meeting. However, the Security Council's accusations against the Netherlands should not be regarded as a complete endorsement of the Indonesian Republic. The views of the Republic have been fully elucidated by many representatives at the New Delhi Conference, but the Dutch side, although there are sufficient reasons, seems to have failed due to the lack of defense. Before the Dutch government attacked the Indonesian Republic, the Security Council had begun to recognize that Indonesian nationalism was not a simple issue between the wishes of the Republic and Dutch "colonialism." There are several powerful groups in the Dutch East Indies who, while recognizing the Republic as their comrades, are unwilling to recognize it as their master. The Dutch government's plan for an Indonesian Federal Government is a wise move. In this plan, the Republic can have its appropriate place, but it cannot exceed this place. Unfortunately, the Dutch government's attack on the Republic has caused deep suspicion of the Dutch government's intentions, and this suspicion will not be dispelled until the new federal government takes effect."

### Arrests of Teachers and Students in the City; University Association Demands Release; Presidents of Thirteen Schools Scheduled to Visit Garrison Commander Today; Two Jiaotong University Professors Granted Bail Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai University and College Association held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Tsinghua Alumni Association. Those in attendance included Wang Zhizhuo from Jiaotong University, Zhang Yi from Fudan University, Ou Yuanhuai from Great China University, Zhu Guozhang from Shanghai Business College, Hu Wenyao from Shanghai Zhen旦 College, Ling Xianyin from Shanghai University, Zhao Xiuhong from St. John's University, Sheng Zhenwei from Soochow University, Chu Fengyi from Shanghai Law College, and Wang Yukai from Guangxia Commercial College, totaling over forty people. Zhang Yi presided over the meeting. There were three important proposals discussed during the meeting: (1) Eighteen students from various schools arrested last autumn are still being held in custody. It has been five months, and they have neither been prosecuted nor released. Recently, there have been incidents of illegal arrests of teachers and students from various schools. The arresting officers did not have warrants from the Special Criminal Court, which is a violation of personal freedom and detrimental to the dignity of academic institutions. In order to uphold justice and maintain the dignity of national law, in addition to sending letters to the Municipal Government, the Garrison Headquarters, and the Special Criminal Court, it was decided that the presidents of thirteen schools, including Jiaotong University, Fudan University, St. John's University, Great China University, Guanghua University, New China Law and Commerce College, Shanghai University, Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Shanghai Zhen旦 College, Shanghai Business College, Tongji University, Datong University, and China Industrial and Commercial College, would jointly visit Garrison Commander Chen Daqing this morning to demand the immediate release of teachers and students arrested in the past without legal procedures and the eighteen students currently in custody. Furthermore, they would demand that there be no arbitrary and illegal arrests of teachers and students in the future, but this proposal was not approved. (2) During the winter vacation, military troops were stationed at Guanghua University, Shanghai Law College, Municipal Industrial College, Teachers College, Physical Education College, and New China Law and Commerce College, which affected the opening of the next semester. It was decided that the school presidents would raise this issue during their visit to Garrison Commander Chen Daqing this morning and urge the withdrawal of the troops. (3) Over thirty Tsinghua University students who came to Shanghai have organized a Southward Student Association. Because their hope of returning to school and resuming their studies next semester is slim, they are requesting that major universities and colleges in Shanghai provide them with opportunities to audit classes. After discussion, the meeting decided that the University and College Association would send letters to all member schools, asking them to provide as much convenience as possible for students from Peiping and Tianjin to audit classes based on each school's situation.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Weiji, the director of the Textile Department of Jiaotong University, and Professor Su Yanbin, who had been arrested, were granted bail yesterday afternoon by the school authorities in conjunction with the China Textile Corporation to the Garrison Headquarters. Another arrested student from the school, Yan Zushou, has also been released.

Furthermore, Chen Siwei, an English professor at China Industrial and Commercial College, has been detained for several months, and despite repeated requests from the school for bail, he remains in custody.

Jiaotong University Professors' Association Resolves to Lodge Protest with the Government

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Jiaotong University Professors' Association held an expanded board meeting yesterday afternoon. Regarding the arrest of Professors Chen and Su from the school, despite their release on bail, they expressed deep indignation that such a violation of human rights occurred in this peaceful atmosphere and decided to lodge a protest with the government. In addition, regarding the contingency measures, it was decided to suggest that the school establish a university-wide contingency organization, consisting of representatives from six units: the school authorities, the Professors' Association, the Lecturers and Assistants Association, the Staff Advancement Association, the Student Self-Government Association, and the Labor-Police Association, with one to three representatives from each unit. The three months of contingency funds that the Ministry of Education previously promised to allocate to each school have not yet been issued, and they urged the school to expedite the allocation from the Ministry of Education. Regarding the relocation of the school, the Professors' Association had previously advocated against it, and the school authorities have not yet received an order to do so. Therefore, they will not consider external rumors. Regarding the request to adjust salaries, the Professors' Association had previously sent a telegram calling for action, but there has been no response to date. It was decided to suggest that the school contact other national universities and colleges in the city to vigorously fight for the adjustment of salaries in accordance with the methods previously drafted by the Legislative Yuan.

### Tang Enbo Issues Statement to Reporters; Local Security Maintained as Usual; Those Disrupting Order and Transportation Will Be Severely Punished

[Our Newspaper's Report] General Tang Enbo, the Commander-in-Chief of the Jinghu-Hang Garrison, received reporters at the Garrison Headquarters at 10:00 AM yesterday and issued several important statements: (1) Since the peace talks began, opinions from all sides have been quite inconsistent. I absolutely support peace, but peace talks are a matter for the government. As a local official, I have the responsibility to maintain local order and security. While the Communist Party continues its advance and the peace talks have not yet succeeded, everything will continue as usual. (2) Anyone who disrupts local security or damages local order and transportation, regardless of who they are, will be severely punished according to military law. (3) I do not oppose the release of political prisoners and the opening of freedom of speech, but I believe that the timing of implementation must be studied. I advocate that the release of political prisoners and the opening of freedom of speech should wait until the Communist army stops its offensive or until the peace talks succeed and a ceasefire is achieved. If the Communist army continues its offensive and the peace talks are not effective, it will absolutely not be possible. Even if the central government orders implementation, I will consider it at that time.

### Answering Reporters' Questions

Tang also answered reporters' questions as follows: (1) Before peace is achieved, local garrison work and city defense works will continue as usual. (2) In his view, the Communist Party will not stop its offensive against Nanjing and Shanghai. (3) Tang's jurisdiction includes Jinghu-Hang and parts of Zhejiang and Anhui. He declined to disclose the strength of his troops. (4) The progress of the peace talks has some impact on the morale of the soldiers, but he believes it is not very serious, because "when the enemy is attacking us, we have no choice but to fight." (5) The treatment of soldiers in the Jinghu area has improved since this month, with an additional two catties of meat and two catties of oil issued each month. (6) He had not heard of foreign reports that parts of Bai Chongxi's troops in Central China and Hu Zongnan's troops in North China had been transferred to the Jinghu area. (7) According to what he knows, there are about a dozen columns of Communist troops on the Nanjing front. The Yangzhou area is not suitable for combat, and the defense there will focus on river defense.

### Inspects Troops and Returns to Nanjing That Evening

Tang met with General Sun Liren yesterday morning, inspected the city's troops in the afternoon, and returned to Nanjing that evening. [Another Report] Chen Daqing, the Garrison Commander of Jinghu, added two points after Tang Enbo's reception of reporters: (1) The current stage is one of talk and war, and there is still a considerable distance to peace. Since the Communist Party continues the war, those who are soldiers should continue to prepare for war. (2) Regardless of talk, war, or peace, local order and security must be maintained.

### Banks Are Unwilling to Undertake Industrial Loans; Municipal Industrial Association Suggests Charging a Handling Fee

[Our Newspaper's Report] In recent months, usury has prevailed, affecting industrial loans. The banks that handle the loans believe that the interest rate on industrial loans is too low. Even if it is calculated according to the Central Bank's re-pledge method, the total monthly interest rate is only 60%. The interest is not as good as interbank lending, so most of them are unwilling to undertake the loans, and factories cannot obtain loans. The Municipal Industrial Association suggested that the Central Bank's discount committee allow the banks that undertake industrial loans to charge a handling fee in addition to the prescribed interest rate in order to compensate for the loss of interest, so as to encourage commercial banks to be willing to handle the loans and enable industrial loans to be universal.

[Our Newspaper] On the night of the typhoon on August 8th of last year, the Yongbei Underwear Factory in Taizhou was struck by lightning, burning 54 workers to death. Following a report by the General Labor Union, the District Prosecutor's Office investigated and found that the Guangnan Water and Electricity Engineering Firm, which contracted the factory's electrical equipment, had failed to fulfill its duties, leading to the disaster. As a result, Guangnan's manager, Guo Zhicheng, and Guangnan's technician, Zhang Qifu, who was responsible for the installation, were indicted on charges of endangering public order. Judge Wu Xiangzu of the District Court held a preliminary hearing yesterday morning. The defendant Guo Zhicheng did not appear, but Zhang Qifu argued that the electrical engineering installed by Guangnan for the Yongbei factory had been approved by both the Public Utilities Bureau and the Works Bureau. He claimed that the installation of a lightning rod had not been requested by Yongbei at the time, so it was not installed, and he could not be held responsible after the fact. The plaintiff was represented by Shui Xiangyun, the former chairman of the Municipal General Labor Union, who provided three points: (1) The Yongbei factory was originally an old-fashioned pawnshop that had been slightly renovated and repainted, and the three stories had been converted into five stories, which was extremely unsafe. (2) The water and electricity engineering was approved by the Public Utilities Bureau, and they should also bear joint responsibility. He demanded a thorough investigation to ensure the safety of workers' lives.

### Restrictions on the Transfer of Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates Greatly Affect Trade; Import and Export Industries Telegraph Ministries and Commissions to Quickly Cancel

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Import and Export Industry Association believes that the low price of foreign exchange transfer certificates is affecting export business. It recently telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Export Management Committee, and the Central Bank, requesting the cancellation of Central Bank Announcement No. 170. The original text is as follows: We note that our country's international trade policy has been repeatedly touted by the government as encouraging exports and expanding imports, and the foreign exchange transfer certificate method is a concrete manifestation of the implementation of the above policies in the past. Since its implementation, it has achieved significant results. Unexpectedly, the Central Bank suddenly issued Announcement No. 170, which strictly restricted the transfer of foreign exchange transfer certificates, and the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates has been declining day by day, and has been in a slump. As a result, exports from all ports in the country are almost completely at a standstill, and the bad state of smuggling and exchange evasion has reappeared today. This method is contrary to the entire national trade policy. The result of suffocating exports is that foreign exchange income decreases, and if foreign exchange income decreases, it is difficult to increase imports. If this continues, it is unimaginable. To remedy this, we should immediately cancel Central Bank Announcement No. 170. This announcement's most obvious consequence is to reduce exports and increase exchange evasion and smuggling. The country suffers serious losses, and it has a major impact on the overseas markets of our export commodities. Taking tung oil as an example, the American Tung Oil Association has repeatedly asked the US government to say that the cost of Chinese tung oil should be around four US cents per pound according to the current price of foreign exchange transfer certificates, while the selling price in the US market is only two cents and one point, which shows that Chinese tung oil is undermining the interests of American tung farmers by dumping at a discount. Therefore, the American side is about to implement anti-dumping regulations and impose an import tax of more than two cents per pound, which is also being brewed. Other items such as bristles have also experienced similar situations. The reason for this is that the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates differs greatly from the actual exchange rate, which leads to exchange evasion and smuggling. Furthermore, the domestic export goods are oppressed by the re-export of goods transferred through Hong Kong. The Hong Kong price is on average 30% lower than the Shanghai export price, which is due to the escape and smuggling. Legitimate export businesses in the country are suffering severe oppression. Moreover, the change in the transfer of foreign exchange transfer certificates has not promoted imports. From a long-term perspective, it is even more unfavorable to imports. Therefore, this restriction on the transfer method is tantamount to killing the chicken to get the eggs, and is a completely unreasonable measure. Therefore, we telegraph you especially to ask you to review and verify, and request you to forward it to the Central Bank, and quickly revoke Announcement No. 170. The export industry really depends on it.

### Vendors Sell for Cash, Rice Prices Slightly Decline, Flour from Northern Suppliers Gradually Gains Popularity

Yesterday, the rice market saw a slight decline, as vendors were mostly selling to finalize accounts, resulting in a large number of sellers. The price of rice in the southern port production area was still low, and the sellers were eager to sell. At the start of the market prices were stable, but because rice shops had limited space to store rice, there was more supply than demand and prices declined. In the Northern District market, white japonica rice retreated to 1,680 yuan, a drop of 40 yuan. Thin indica rice fell 50 yuan, while sheep indica rice was stable. Yin yuan was 50 yuan lower. In the Southern District market, white japonica and thin indica each fell 20 to 30 yuan. The arrival of early rice was at its highest, and prices plummeted by 100 yuan. Yesterday, the two markets received a total of 9,985 piculs.

Flour prices rose. Although rice prices fell, the northern suppliers shipped rice north, so prices soared. The initial asking price for Lao Che flour was 700 yuan, and later it rose to 735 yuan at closing, a huge increase of 60 yuan compared to last Saturday. Bingchuan flour closed at 710 yuan, up 55 yuan. Hong Feng, Jiancheng, etc. all offered over 700 yuan, up more than 50 yuan. Bran also rose 40 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains: The market was originally scheduled to finalize procedures yesterday, but because some traders had surplus or insufficient funds, there were still a few transactions, causing prices to fall due to excess supply. Yellow soybeans were down by one hundred yuan, corn by fifty yuan, sesame, red sorghum, and tea beans were all stable, and the off-the-street sales of raw peanuts were still good, and prices were also stable.

Cooking Oil

Traders are still gathering at the market to finalize procedures, but due to funding issues, there are still a few transactions, and prices have fallen sharply. Soybean oil closed at 6,400 yuan, down 900 yuan. Jilong raw oil fell sharply to 6,500 yuan, a dramatic drop of 1,450 yuan, due to the low price in Qingdao and the expectation of shipments.

### Yarn Market Supply Exceeds Demand

The yarn market was strong at first but then fatigued. Although credit was loose, direct sales were still not smooth. Only scattered households made slight purchases, but eventually, due to excessive supply, the market showed a lack of momentum to rise. As a result, the average yarn price fell by about 10%. 42-count Blue Phoenix retreated from 81,000 yuan to close at 77,000 yuan, ultimately falling 4,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix fell 6,500 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon opened at the previous weekend's original price of 69,000 yuan, but no one was interested in buying it midway, and it ended at 61,000 yuan, plummeting 8,000 yuan. 21-count Shuangma spot retreated from 60,000 yuan to as low as 50,000 yuan, and closed at 52,000 yuan in the afternoon, 6,000 yuan lower than the weekend.

Cotton Cloth: At the beginning of the morning's trading, those who held the goods were worried about the currency system after the peace, and the asking prices rose sharply. Midway, the sales to other areas were weak, the customers had little intention of buying, and the local demand was also low. The rising momentum eventually ran out of steam, and the market retreated slightly, closing at a lower price than the weekend, but still slightly higher. Dragon Head fine cloth initially asked for 2,500 yuan, but as the yarn market was reported to be falling, sentiment turned weak, and the price declined gradually. At midday, the lowest price was heard to be around 2,400 yuan. Trumpet fine cloth retreated from 2,100 yuan to a low of 2,050 yuan, and closed at 2,070 yuan in the afternoon, ultimately rising 220 yuan. Other items such as Three Peaches and B Dragon Head fine cloth, etc., each rose by 150 yuan to 250 yuan. The initial opening trend of Four Gentlemen's Yuan Biji was very high, asking for 2,250 yuan, but no one was selling. The closing became fatigued at 2,210 yuan, 240 yuan higher than the weekend. Four Gentlemen's Yuan Zhigong rose 290 yuan, ending at 2,450 yuan. The sales of other cloths were sluggish, and the price changed little.

### Silk Market Flat and Tired

Yesterday's market conditions for rayon fluctuated. As the end of the year approached, scattered households sold continuously, while buyers were very indifferent. Sentiment was weak, credit in the market turned loose, and the market was about to close. Delivery was very complicated. Each stall opened high and closed low. As a result, there was not much fluctuation in the morning market, and the trend in the afternoon market was slightly softer. 120-count Tianqiao opened at 80,000 yuan and sold. Credit saw easing and the stall tried to pull the table up, it looked like there was still a firm plate in the market. Later the cotton market dropped and the gold notes dropped too and they were holding inventory as the situation turned anxious. The market conditions retreated. 75,000 yuan was the morning closing. In the afternoon, gold notes continued to decline, everything turned soft, and the sentiment became more weary, and the price was reduced by another 2,000 yuan.

Raw silk: Because the Rayon market was failing, sentiment was lacking to stimulate it. The year end was nearing, and foreign firms mostly stopped buying. Transactions on the stall turned lonely, and the market fell from plate. Excellent grade was 85,000 yuan to close in the first half, just a slight lift from last Saturday. In the afternoon the sentiment was very weak, and there were no takers. The market shouted 83,000 yuan, 84,000 yuan.

Because Gold notes and cloth were under pressure, investment money continued to be squeezed. There was a heavy appetite from the market. Beauty Asia was being advertised at 55,000 yuan with a healthy trend and the buyer was active and the asking price would go up a bit to a thousand. But because the end of the year draws near and as gold notes and cotton price went down, and people became hesitant and soft on the market, it was immediately leveling out. On the front half of the market it closed at 53,000 yuan, showing a lift. With some increased demand. On the after noon market sentiment was idle, and money was coming in and selling. However because the money was smaller, and appetite went slow, and the market became weak as Beauty Asia advertised at 51,500 yuan for offers.

### Little Activity in the Woolen Fabric Market

Yesterday's market for tung oil, the official price for standard white oil and genuine Xihong, and guild brands all remained at 4,000 yuan without change. Other brands such as deputy brand Xihong and Qing oil, traders asking price has been rather quiet. Market transactions indicate very little business and trading due to year end. Both buyers and sellers adhered to traditional customs and were busy settling accounts for the year and made any business.

### Tea Market Quiet

As the end of the agricultural year approaches, most industries in this city are settling accounts according to custom. Therefore, tea merchants have been uninterested in making transactions for days, and the process has become even quieter. However, sentiment is unusually stable, so the market can be described as firm. According to people in the industry, the current stock of tea is very low, and sellers are reluctant to part with it.

### Police New Village Fundraising Basketball Game:  Hua Lian Triumphs Over Shanghai Police, Fat Team Fights Valiantly but Loses to Police Mobile Unit by Three Points, Charity Auction of Balls Raises 70,000 Gold Yuan

[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Police Department held a charity basketball game last night at the Municipal Gymnasium to raise construction funds for the Police New Village.  Commissioner Yu Shuping, along with other police officials, attended the event, which began at 6:00 PM and was watched by nearly a thousand spectators, creating a lively atmosphere. Commissioner Yu also presented each of the four participating teams with a banner to commemorate the occasion. The police band provided musical accompaniment, adding to the spirited and exciting atmosphere.

At 7:00 PM, a charity ball auction was held. Mr. Ding initially bid 50,000, but did not accept the ball. Mr. Dong then purchased it for 20,000, demonstrating admirable generosity. In the first game, the Fat Team fought valiantly but was defeated by the Police Mobile Unit by a score of 32-35, losing by only one and a half baskets. In the main event, Hua Lian maintained its reputation by defeating the mighty Shanghai Police team, which was a guise of Chen You. The encounter between the two teams fulfilled a long-held wish and attracted the attention of many fans. Ultimately, Hua Lian's entire team exerted their efforts and delivered an excellent performance, winning 49-37, with a score of 27-17 in the first half. Detailed match information is as follows:

First Game: Fat Team vs. Police Mobile Unit. The latter scored first, and the Fat Team became anxious, immediately scoring a free throw. The Police Mobile Unit was resourceful, experienced and skilled. They led 5-1. At 10-6, the Fat Team called another time-out, and the game resumed, becoming increasingly intense. In the first half, "Fatty" protested, and the Police Mobile Unit led 18-12. In the second half, the Fat Team's momentum shifted, and they scored points with long-range shots, once narrowing the gap to just one basket (18-16). Unfortunately, the good times did not last, and they gradually fell behind again. However, the Fat Team had many tricks up their sleeves, constantly adjusting their lineup to catch their breath. Sun Mingxin was the team's "Number One," weighing over 200 pounds. His basketball skills were also not bad, shooting accurately from the right corner. The sound of the ball bouncing indicated the Fat Team's fierce offense. The buzzer sounded, and the Police Mobile Unit won 35-32, the Fat Team losing by only three points.

Hua Lian Defeats Shanghai Police

In the main event, Hua Lian faced the Shanghai Police. Liu Fushan, Bao Songyuan, Chuan Jinsheng, Wu Chengzhang, and Li Zhenzhong were Hua Lian's five tigers. The Shanghai Police's five players were Chuan Qixia, He Zeng, Wang Bowen, Shi Jiuquan, and Wang Rongsheng. Shanghai Police's Wang Rongsheng made a free throw first, and Hua Lian's Ah Di Da Li scored five consecutive points. Shanghai Police's Wang Bowen scored two baskets, tying the score at 5-5. Chengzhang scored one point, taking the lead. Wang Rongsheng and Lao Bao both made free throws, tying the score again at 7-7. Songyuan scored twice under the basket, putting Hua Lian ahead 11-7, leading by four points. Fushan also went from static to dynamic, making it 15-9. Shanghai Police alternated He and Jin Gui with Zeng. At this point, Hua Lian had a good passing performance, making it 17-9. Zhang Liangxiong replaced Fu Jinsheng, and on the other side, Liang Yongbiao replaced Shi Jiuquan. Hua Lian's "Wu Bao" duo revealed their prowess, and the opponent's formation was disorganized. At 24-15, Shanghai Police's Sun Moses replaced Wang Bowen, and Hua Lian's Xiao Le replaced Fushan. The two teams engaged in three minutes of "blind flight," a chaotic back-and-forth battle. Hua Lian's momentum was strong, making the score 27-17 at halftime. Scorers: Hua Lian Wu 11 points, Bao 10, and Da Li and Fushan 2 points each.

After the break, Shanghai Police's Wang Rongsheng replaced Chuan Qixia, and Wang Bowen replaced He Zeng. Hua Lian's Han Ting brought out Liangxiong, probably not to play for the time being. Hua Lian showed a one-sided posture, and the Shanghai Police scored only one basket while they increased their score by eleven points. At 38-19, the red-clad team could not exert its power, and at 40-23, Jinsheng returned to the battlefield, and Jia Zhou left. Shanghai Police increased their score by seven points in an instant, as if there was still hope, but time was running out. At 44-34, Han Ting graduated, and Jinsheng entered. In the end, Hua Lian won 49-37.

### Basketball League Authorities Refuse Spectators Without Tickets

The fourth Basketball League for Group A First Division, Group A Second Division, and the Women's Division opened on the 22nd of this month. Over two thousand spectators attended, with enthusiastic spirits. However, only over four hundred tickets were sold for the lower level, indicating a large number of attendees without tickets. Fearing that league revenues would not be balanced in the future, the organizers issued the following statement:

"This time, we bravely took on this difficult task, and all the construction is mostly for the sake of the competing players. The required funds cannot be raised, so we plan to use the revenue from ticket sales for the games to make up for this. What is taken from sports will be used for sports. From now on, we will have to politely refuse entry to those without tickets. Players should enter the game or watch with their player cards. We also hope that they will not accompany friends without tickets into the venue to avoid disputes with ticket inspectors. We hope that everyone will understand these unavoidable measures."

### Act Three of the Basketball League: Shanghai Police Face N.K.A.S. Today; Two Group A Second Division Matches First, Starting at 5:30 PM

The fourth Basketball League continues today, starting at 5:30 PM, with three acts at the Municipal Gymnasium. Tickets are 25 yuan for the upper level, 50 yuan for the lower level, and 80 yuan for reserved seating inside the venue. There are no women's matches today.

Hua Nan vs. He Zhong (A2 B) 5:30 PM

Tie Lian vs. American Weather (A2 C) 6:30 PM

Shanghai Police vs. N.K.A.S. (A1 Group) 7:30 PM

In the first match of Group A2 B, Hua Nan faces He Zhong. Hua Nan has a considerable history in Shanghai. This time, they are making a comeback, no different from Chun Mao, with veterans such as Liu Fuqiang, Li Xianzheng, and Deng Guozhang, and the addition of new forces Huang Tianlie and He Hanfu, making them even stronger. He Zhong is also a strong team in this group, with a lineup primarily from Zhongyi. They are sure to have a fierce battle with Hua Nan. Next is Group A2 C, Tie Lian vs. American Weather. The latter played against Donghua in a friendly match. Although they won first and then lost, their performance was not weak. They must be cautious when facing Tie Lian, otherwise, they may suffer a sneak attack.

Hua Lian vs. Western Union (Charity Match) 2:30 PM, Yiyuan

The last act is Group A, N.K.A.S. vs. Shanghai Police. The foreign team has always been powerful among the Western teams in the city and has often been a major concern for our Chinese teams. This year, in addition to the Kairoski brothers, Clebert Otto Chai Liao, and others, the giant main players Kaiji Miilov, Funik, and others are all mobilized, showing a great ambition to win the championship. The Shanghai Police is a guise of Chen You. They gathered for training in the Chen You Cup last season, so they were able to keep pace with Huili, and their hopes for the championship are high. Their strength and cooperation are well-known. He Zeng, Wang Bowen, Wang Rongsheng, Chuan Qixia, and others all possess superb skills. Facing the foreign team for the first time, they should be able to display everything. However, having fought Hua Lian in the charity game the night before, they may feel slightly fatigued, which is a concern.

### Huainan Under the Sound of Peace Talks

— Special Correspondent Liang Feng

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou Seventeenth Telegram] Since Zhu Ziwen was ordered to preside over Guangdong in the autumn of the year before last, informed people have seen that this vast Huainan area will become an important base for the government's politics, military affairs, and economy. Now, this question has an even clearer answer. Indeed, amidst the flames of war, the ferocity of the conflict has approached the Yangtze River basin, and only this remote southern region can still be said to have "stability." However, the burden of the great rear area on its shoulders will increase with the evolution of the situation.

The Influx of Refugees Heading South

Arrived like a tidal wave a month ago, adding a lot of excitement to this quiet southern region. Although no one has ever counted how much the population has increased, now, in any corner, especially in more upscale public places, one can hear the accents of Mandarin spoken by those "out-of-province" friends, making people almost think that the government's promotion of the national language movement has achieved such widespread success, and feel amazed. These people who came south naturally felt fortunate when they first stepped into the gates of Guangzhou. But when they settled down, they immediately felt the threat of the high cost of living, because Guangzhou is probably the city with the highest prices in the country now. Even if they brought "IOUs," one note could only be exchanged for a few Hong Kong dollars, and almost all daily expenses here require Hong Kong dollars, which inevitably makes them imagine: they can escape death, but they cannot escape the terror of hunger. Therefore, many people came with excitement, but many returned in disappointment.

However, until now, this surge of people has continued to increase. Staff and families of various central government agencies have become a large column, collectively arriving in a mighty manner by sea, land, and air. Naturally, these poor civil servants will immediately taste what it is like to live under the "salty dragon" (Cantonese term for Hong Kong dollars). Moreover, as the population increases, the market price of Hong Kong dollars will inevitably increase due to high demand, and the price of everything based on Hong Kong dollars will be even more unpredictable. Here, some people may ask: Guangzhou is a Chinese territory, why is it allowing Hong Kong dollars to circulate so freely, and why doesn't the government stop it? This question is indeed perplexing, but the fact is just that. This is probably because the law only prohibits the trading of foreign currency, but does not prohibit people from holding it, so transactions in the market, although

Everything is settled in Hong Kong dollars

It can be said that it is "transfer of ownership" rather than a trading behavior, which leaves the authorities helpless. Moreover, the authorities seem to advocate letting general market trade develop freely, rather than excessively strict control. In Guangzhou now, there is indeed no shortage of resources, whether they are daily necessities or non-essential goods. However, the continuous rise in prices is also frightening enough. This is naturally an unavoidable fact in the situation of weak production and insufficient supply. But the political and economic policy here is not afraid of it rising, only afraid of not having it, so it can maintain a relatively stable facade in Guangdong when the markets in Beijing and Shanghai are most chaotic, which is the reason.

Since Mr. Song took charge of Guangdong for more than a year, the most obvious political achievement that people recognize is that he is most capable in dealing with food, which is also a result of his efforts in material regulation. However, there are also two things that he considers most troublesome, namely smuggling and public security. Regarding the former, it can be said that it is not very serious at present. In recent months, in addition to some smuggling of grain and tungsten ore exports, the smuggling of imported goods has indeed decreased significantly. This is certainly related to the strengthening of inspections by both parties after the Sino-Hong Kong anti-smuggling agreement, but the main reason is probably the generally weak purchasing power of domestic cities. Although there are many routes for foreign goods to come, the domestic sales are sluggish, and the price of goods naturally falls, making smugglers feel it is not worthwhile, and they would rather not do it on their own. Therefore, this problem is temporarily considered to have come to an end, but the latter problem has become increasingly serious. Since Mr. Song

Began to take charge of the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters

He has been striving to strengthen the issue of public security. Mr. Song subsequently employed a group of veteran generals known for their good faces during the Anti-Japanese War to establish ten suppression zones and two border zone command headquarters. Together with the navy stationed in Guangdong by the Central Government and a newly trained national army, the military strength has at least tripled compared to before. However, the results of suppression in various zones were not as ideal as he had hoped. According to the recent report of the Security Department to the Senate: the total number of bandits in the province is 32,000. Even if this number is true, it proves that bandits have not decreased due to suppression, but have only increased compared to the 29,000 reported by the previous Senate. Moreover, in last winter, several units that had originally surrendered and been incorporated defected: such as the entire battalion of Wang Guoquan's 11th Security Battalion in Dongjiang; two companies of the 6th Security Regiment on Hainan Island; and the most rampant, two battalions of Chen Yilin's 10th Security Regiment on the South Road. This time, they also tricked and killed Mr. Song's "favorite general," Zhang Junhao, commander of the 10th Suppression Zone (formerly the head of the Tax Police Regiment, and commander of the Provisional 8th Division during the war), and deputy commander Deng Bohan. This was indeed a great blow to Mr. Song.

Mr. Song's understanding of this problem is that the treatment of security teams is too poor, less than half that of the national army. Therefore, he decided to increase their treatment as much as possible without increasing the burden on the people; recently, he has also changed to issuing in-kind benefits. At present, the treatment of security teams in Guangdong Province is actually better than that of the national army. At the same time, Mr. Song further realized that using soldiers to defend the people is not as effective as the people defending themselves. Therefore, he organized a fairly large people's self-defense force.

The Provincial People's Self-Defense Force

Already has a total of 500 companies, and the reserve self-defense force has more than 3,000 companies. According to statistics: Guangdong has at least 300,000 civilian guns. If they can be used well, it will of course be a considerable force. Therefore, he shouted out the slogan "Determine to Defend Guangdong"; gathered people from all walks of life, and established a local self-defense guidance committee. Deputy Commander Huang Guoliang, a lieutenant general of the Guangdong Security Forces who had years of experience in combat in Jiangbei Shandong, drafted a "New Plan for Suppressing Bandits in Guangdong Province." The main point is to use the self-defense forces of the people to launch a guerrilla plan. Mr. Song repeatedly expressed his willingness to humbly accept opinions from all parties at the meeting. This point is credible. Mr. Song, who is considered an expert in finance and economics, probably also learned some lessons during the suppression year and more; knowing that using soldiers is not as easy as he imagined. Therefore, he has strongly urged veterans like Xue Yue and Zhang Fakui to come out of retirement, and he is willing to cede military power to more capable people.

Some time ago, there were rumors that the five provinces of Huainan (Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Fujian) would establish a joint defense organization, or that a general headquarters for suppressing bandits in the five provinces would be established. The source of this rumor may be due to the fact that the chairmen of Guangxi and Fujian provinces, and representatives of the chairmen of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guizhou provinces visited Mr. Song in Guangzhou one after another last winter. I dare not say that they completely had no such intention, but even if there is a plan for the connection of the five provinces, I believe it is more in the economic aspect, and very little in the military and political aspects. Because the leaders of various provinces in Huainan may have considerable potential in their local areas. Under the current situation, it is not easy to find a general who can have

The prestige to command the five provinces

and power. If it is an economic cooperation organization, such as the exchange of materials, transportation, and stabilization of finance among the five provinces, then of course there is an absolute possibility. Because what Mr. Song can truly show his achievements in Huainan is probably still in economic construction. Indeed, since Mr. Song took office,

Significant Progress in Economic Construction

has been his characteristic. Such as building Huangpu Port; planning the Wengjiang Hydropower Project; planning the construction of a coal-fired Dogtooth Cave branch line; increasing the construction of sugar factories and restoring the Guangzhou Paper Factory; actively developing transportation, and building water conservancy projects, etc., not only is he working hard, but some of them have already had concrete results. Take the Huangpu Port project as an example. Since the completion of the highway connecting Huangpu and Guangzhou, as well as the docks and warehouses, it has assumed a great responsibility in this evacuation. There have been hundreds of large and small ships berthed at Huangpu Wharf; all people or goods can be conveniently transported to Guangzhou by road. The second phase of construction of Huangpu is still actively being carried out. As for the Dogtooth Cave branch line, 25,000 workers are currently mobilized every day, spending 2 billion yuan, and it will be completed by the end of this month. After its completion, the mining area is estimated to have 7,200 tons of coal, which can be supplied continuously. According to the daily coal demand of Guangdong as 500 tons, it can supply for 50 to 100 years. Even after the supply of northern coal is cut off, the coal in Huainan provinces is sufficient and more than enough to supply. As for the remaining construction projects, they are also being actively promoted. Therefore, if the public security problem in Guangdong can be solved, it will shorten some milestones on the bright road of economic construction.

(8) The work of transcribing household registration books can make full use of woodcuts to save manpower and make them neat.

### The Salt Problem in Guizhou Province is Serious

— Our Reporter Liu Mengchi

[Our Newspaper Guiyang Twelfth Airmail] Chairman Gu Zhenglun took a special train to Chongqing and flew to Beijing early in the morning of New Year's Eve last year after receiving a telegram from the President. He flew back to Guiyang after more than ten days. Our reporter went to visit him on the second day after his return to Guiyang. Due to various reasons, he talked very little about the current situation, but he talked in detail about the beginning and end of the salt problem that 11 million Guizhou people have been anxious about day and night and has been noisy for a month, and believes that this salt problem, which is indispensable to the lives of the people of Guizhou, if the relevant authorities in the central government cannot find a way to provide relief as soon as possible, the impact of the salt shortage in the future, whether the overall situation is peace or war, and the public security order in the rear, will be difficult to predict. He said: Although the central government has agreed to find a way to provide relief, the salt problem is often said to be related to national finances, and coupled with the low administrative efficiency of our country, the thorough solution of this problem cannot but rely on the power of the people. According to Gu, Guizhou salt

Has relied on Sichuan salt supply. Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Sichuan-Kang Salt Bureau has increased prices at any time, and the people of Guizhou have long expressed their dissatisfaction. Especially from the introduction of the Gold Yuan to December 1 last year, the time was only three months, but the salt price has been adjusted six times, as high as more than 53 times. Before the war, the people were happy to talk about rice and salt per catty. At present, the highest price of rice per dou is only 20 yuan, while the black market price of salt per catty has reached 25 yuan, which means that a dou of rice cannot buy a catty of salt. This refers to Guiyang City. In remote counties and villages, salt has long been regarded as a "treat." Unless there are weddings, funerals, celebrations, or festivals, they dare not even think about it. Salt is one of the "seven things to open the door every day" in people's lives. Such a strange rise in price, exceeding the people's ability to bear it, is unthinkable in the future!

Since the Sichuan-Kang Bureau announced the salt account, the dissatisfaction of the people of Guizhou with the Bureau has become even more intense. First of all, Gu Zhenglun himself scolded the Sichuan-Kang Bureau loudly on the phone with Zhu Shaoliang, director of the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters, for "neither benefiting the country nor harming the people." Then, the county and municipal governments and the people of Guizhou Province unanimously advocated

Thoroughly liquidate the Salt Bureau, making a great deal of noise. During this period, although there was a great deal of noise, the people could still buy salt per catty at black market prices because the Salt Bureau had abundant reserves. By the end of December, the Sichuan-Kang Salt Bureau suddenly received a telegram ordering the Guizhou Salt Bureau to "temporarily postpone the sale of official and commercial salt per catty that has been taxed and shipped out of the warehouse." As a result, more than 300,000 people in Guiyang City, from December 29 to January 4, did not have an ounce of salt supply in the city for a week. The black market salt per catty originally cost only 11 or 12 yuan. During this week, it rose day by day, reaching as high as 24 or 25 yuan per catty, and it still required "connections" to buy it. Although the Provincial Senate and the Provincial Government repeatedly called for urgent telegrams to release sales as soon as possible, the Salt Bureau levied salt tax at the central government level and changed to ad valorem collection. The collection standard was also approved by the second session of the Legislative Yuan, and 10% was levied on those who sold in Guizhou. Its cost per dan was 137 yuan and 66 cents, and the assessment was 14 yuan per zu, and it was implemented from January 1 this year. However, since December 1 last year, the assessed price per dan of well salt in Guiyang has been 578 yuan and 78 cents. How unreasonable is this, exceeding the 137 yuan and 66 cents approved by the Legislative Yuan. The Sichuan-Kang Salt Bureau saw that the Guizhou salt problem could not be solved, which was not their blessing, and Guizhou Province was determined to open up Guangdong, Yunnan, Huai and other places to salt. Sichuan salt will soon run into obstacles in Guizhou. If they do not reduce prices as soon as possible, they will also be making a cocoon and imprisoning themselves. Therefore, after the sales were released on January 4, it was decided again that "all salt catties that were allocated but not received before December 1 will be allowed to be distributed according to the previous pricing method after adding 8 yuan and 40 cents of salt tax per dan, and the amount will be paid." The so-called salt price allocated before December 1 was 233 yuan and 77 cents per dan, and the salt tax was 5 yuan and 60 cents per dan. However, the Salt Bureau has a restriction that it must be "allocated but not received," and only those who have prepaid part of the price are valid.

What is the current price of Guizhou salt stipulated by the Sichuan-Kang Salt Bureau

By claiming that the salt tax has been reformed? It stipulates that each dan is 716 yuan, 1 jiao and 4 fen, which is nearly 200 yuan more than the 578 yuan, 7 jiao and 8 fen, which the people of Guizhou have been opposing for a month since the assessed price of December 1. The result of the opposition is like this. How can the people of Guizhou live without finding a way to open up Guangdong, Yunnan and Huai salt? Gu Zhilun has been promoting the planting of American tobacco, rapeseed, and tung oil in Guizhou as much as possible, hoping to exchange them for Guangdong salt with Guangdong, and trying to mobilize the legislative and supervisory committee members and national representatives outside the province and the important officials of Guizhou origin who work in the central government to cooperate with him to jointly appeal to the central government to strictly order the Sichuan-Kang Salt Bureau to reduce the salt price. He believes that as long as the people of Guizhou can have salt to eat, and even not eat expensive salt, that is the only great good deed he can do as the chairman of Guizhou Province to comfort the people of Guizhou. According to Gu's words to the reporter: The Guizhou salt problem

Is so bad, because: (1) Government and merchants collude to cheat and raise prices. Salt merchants must respond to any request to increase prices. Except for a part of the salt sold by the Salt Bureau itself, the salt transportation and sales in Guizhou are entrusted to merchants. If the salt transporters believe that the cost is insufficient, they can request the Salt Bureau to increase the freight to compensate, otherwise they will threaten to stop transportation, while creating rumors and black markets to obtain double profits from increasing freight and selling salt on the black market. There are more than a dozen existing entrusted salt transporters in Guizhou, including [Zhonghe], [Daye], and [Limin]. On the surface, they are just transporters, but in the dark, they have countless salespersons as followers, and they also collude with the Salt Bureau. Moreover, they themselves are Hao's capital, using the means of semi-official and semi-commercial buying and selling to harm the people of Guizhou. If salt officials, financiers, and transporters communicate to form a series, the salt problem in Guizhou Province will never be solved. (2) The Salt Bureau is poorly managed, the measures are inappropriate, and the transportation and sales methods are outdated and do not conform to reality. Guizhou Province needs 110,000 dans of salt per month. At the current salt price, each zu is 716 yuan, 1 jiao and 4 fen, and the monthly cost is more than 78 million yuan. The annual total is nearly 800 million yuan in gold yuan. Such a huge number, private capital, Miao is difficult to take on. Transportation in Guizhou Province is inconvenient. It takes more than four months to transport it from Zigong or Yule production sites in Sichuan to the wholesale location in Guizhou. The capital of the long-term transportation is huge, and ordinary merchants cannot do it.

Gu Zhenglun and enlightened people in Guizhou believe that to solve the salt problem, it is necessary to

Implement the following methods to make the 11 million people of Guizhou have no suffering from expensive salt and light salt: (1) Please ask the central government to clearly designate this province as a special sales area, and all salt transportation and sales will be handled by the state. (2) Before the state unifies the handling, the salt tax should be collected at the production site, the government will handle the transportation from the site to the shore, and the people will be allowed to freely transport and sell from the shore to the province, and break the sales area system to allow the people to freely purchase and eat Yunnan and Huai salt without restrictions. (3) Please provide low-interest loans from the National Bank for the purchase and transportation of salt. (4) Adopt the "Ding Baozhen Gongbao Salt Law," which has been effective for decades, to implement official transportation and commercial sales, increase salt storage bases, and adopt strict management methods. (5) The provincial government may request the appointment of a deputy head to participate in the central salt affairs agencies set up in this province to adjust surpluses and deficiencies and manage all the businesses of official transportation and commercial sales. (6) Telegram the central government to strictly order the Salt Bureau to store the full amount of Changping salt in this province, and only sell it when there is a salt shortage. It cannot be sold together with commercial salt at ordinary times. (7) Please ask the central government to thoroughly investigate and punish the salt affairs officials and merchants who collude and commit fraud, and announce the numbers of salt cats that have been allocated but not sold before December 1948. (8) Please ask the central government to take into account that Guizhou Province does not produce salt and specially approve the reduction of salt prices.

### A Murder Case in Wuxi City: The Tragic Death of the Manager's Wife

[Our Newspaper Wuxi Twenty-second Telegram] Jiang Jingzhai, the manager of the Wuxi branch of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank, currently lives at No. 4 Shawenjing, Guangfu Gate. At more than 10:00 p.m. on the 20th of this month, Jiang and his wife, Wang Suyue, were lying in bed when suddenly a strange thug broke in, claiming to be surnamed Wang, a native of Jiangyin. When he explained his intention, an old servant happened to go out to get tea. The thug, fearing that he would go out to report to the police, immediately took out a pistol from his sleeve and shot at Jiang. Because he avoided it properly, he was not hit. Jiang's wife, Wang, tried to persuade him, but the thug fired two shots at her. The second bullet entered from the temple, and she died before reaching the hospital. Seeing that he had caused trouble, the thug hurriedly went downstairs and fled. At that time, the Queen's Theater was just dismissing the audience, and the thug mixed into the crowd and escaped. After the incident, the city defense command immediately issued an emergency alert, announced special martial law, and sent investigation team members to rush to the scene of the incident to conduct a detailed investigation. Finally, the major suspect in the case, Shi Yubao, was captured the next morning.

The Victim: A Page of Vicissitudes

Since the case occurred, because it is located in the city and is very close to the Guangfu Gate Guard, and such a bizarre murder case occurred during martial law, it has spread throughout the city. According to general speculation, the content of this case is complex and there must be other circumstances. The victim, Wang Suyue, is 28 years old, originally surnamed Pan, from outside the West Gate of Liyang. Her family was as poor as the law. When she was three years old, her mother sent her to the prostitute Wang outside Guangfu Gate as an adopted daughter, named Xiao Jindi (an elder sister named Da Jindi was also an adopted daughter). When she was nine years old, she suffered from typhoid fever and external symptoms. Although her left foot was bad, fortunately it did not hinder her walking style. In the spring of 1943, Xiao Jindi met Jiang Jingzhai (over 50 years old), an employee of the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank. The two fell in love at first sight and soon lived together. Jindi's name was changed to "Wang Suyue." After the victory, Jiang managed to become the manager of the Xif Branch of the Provincial Farmers Bank and had smooth sailing.

Married the Manager: Became Famous for Speculation

After Jiang and Wang lived together, Wang was unusually clever and gained Jiang's favor. Jiang had a total of three wives and concubines, the eldest was in Shanghai, the second was in Suzhou, and Suyue ranked third, living in Wuxi. She accompanied her husband to work in the bank every day, serving him on the left and right. When prices fluctuated, she also took the opportunity to do business. Because she was capable and had good skills, no matter what the market was, rice, flour, gauze, gold, etc., no one did not know about "Mrs. Jiang" when they talked about it. Jiang's family was also managed by Suyue. Even speaking of the bedroom of the Jiang family, the whole set of pink furniture was of unparalleled elegance, which shows one aspect of the happiness of the Jiang family.

Poor Brother-in-Law: Borrowing Money Caused Trouble

Jiang has a relative, Shi Yubao, who is from Shijia, Qianzhou, and currently lives at No. 10 Xiaocai Market, Zhoushanbang. He once worked as an agent, so he has a White Langlin pistol. Now he has a rice and grain stall there, and business is normal. His wife, Yue, is "Da Jindi," and Wang is a righteous sister. The two have a good relationship after marrying and often visit each other. However, because the husbands they married are very different in wealth, one is a bank manager and the other is a local rascal, Shi often borrowed money from Jiang. Half a month ago, he borrowed one stone of rice and 1,000 yuan in gold yuan. Shi wrote a threatening letter to Jiang because it was not enough for expenses, saying: I have helped you a lot and helped your wife earn a lot of money. You should borrow some money, otherwise I will personally settle the account at your home. The words were very threatening. Jiang ignored it at that time. After the bloody case occurred, the investigation team believed that Shi was a major suspect, so they sent people to arrest him. It is not difficult to obtain the real culprit based on this clue.

### A Recent Incident in Chengdu: Sharp Conflict Between the Municipal Government and the City Council

— Our Correspondent Zhou Xueduan

[Our Newspaper Chengdu Dispatch, 21st] As the lunar New Year approaches, the festive atmosphere in the inland city of Chengdu is much stronger than that of the Gregorian New Year. In recent days, families have been replacing peach wood charms to welcome the new year with firecrackers, and the wave of peace adds a touch of "prosperity." Although the war is far away, the general public's concern for peace is no less than that of compatriots closer to the war zone. After ten years of turmoil, the people are weary. Moreover, the price surge, which came with the old year, weighs heavily on people's lives, and their desire for governance is redoubled.

In this atmosphere of peace, unfortunately, discord between the Chengdu Municipal Government and the City Council has sparked a contentious dispute fraught with animosity. Originally, Chengdu Mayor Qiao Cheng belonged to the "nouveau riche" in the Sichuan officialdom, while the City Council had many social "celebrities" and "dignitaries." In the eyes of the councilors, Mayor Qiao was a young upstart who had climbed to a high position through connections, and there was a deep-seated reason to look down on him. In addition, Qiao's measures in recent years have been quite inappropriate, and he has been at a loss in municipal affairs. In particular, the inability to solve the city's finances has caused the most criticism regarding employee benefits and municipal construction. The cause of the conflict has been long-standing. At the last City Council general meeting, concerning the issue of Mayor Qiao concurrently serving as the director of the donation office involving "corruption," the council unanimously passed a resolution to report six major charges against Qiao to the provincial government: (1) extravagant decrees, (2) illegal collection of fees for national identity cards, (3) illegal collection of money for illicit gain, (4) stealing and selling public grain, (5) illegal collection of children's welfare funds, and (6) misguided measures. In addition to sending letters to the provincial government, the Sichuan-Kang Supervision Committee, and the administrative office to report the matter, the speaker and deputy speaker personally met with Chairman Wang Lingji to request his removal and investigation. However, several months have passed, and the provincial government has not investigated, and Mayor Qiao has continued to do things his own way, determined to deal with the situation with the Huang-Lao philosophy of "letting them laugh and scold as they please, I will be a good official myself." This has further aroused the extreme dissatisfaction of all councilors. The council convened its twelfth general meeting a few days ago, and in addition to holding an opening ceremony and issuing a telegram supporting peace, it formally announced its adjournment to show that it would never coexist with the mayor and would not reconvene until the goal of replacing Qiao was achieved. The next day, senior officials of the municipal government collectively resigned to protest the council's actions. The evolving situation is seen by Mayor Qiao as "personal spite," by the council as a matter of "parliamentary dignity," by the provincial government as "illegitimate," and by the common people as "a farce." Today, the stalemate has become even more acute. Some believe that the conflict between the government and the council may cause waves in the Sichuan political scene. How it will develop remains to be seen in the next installment.

Follow-up Report on the Case of Yu Chao, Assistant Manager of the Tunxi Branch of the Former Central Bank of China

[Our Newspaper Tunxi Dispatch, 18th] Wang Gongchen, prosecutor of the Xiuning District Court, recently released the indictment of Yu Chao, the former assistant manager of the Tunxi Branch of the Bank of China, for embezzlement. The original text is nearly ten thousand words, detailing the investigation process of the case and the criminal charges, which have been submitted to the criminal court of the court for trial, along with a request to increase his sentence and impose a severe penalty. As for the accomplices involved in the case, due to the complexity of the content, further investigation is needed, and they will be handled separately.

[Another Dispatch] The reporter recently visited Jiang Tonghou, speaker of the Anhui Provincial Council, who is recuperating in his hometown of Dongyuan (Longfu), three miles from Tunxi, to inquire about his views on the peace issue and the future trends in northern and southern Anhui. He pondered this question for a long time and slowly replied, "Peace is difficult, and war is also difficult, but only peace can restore the people's livelihood, so war is not as good as peace." Jiang is a native of She County in southern Anhui. He was once known as the "Jiangnan Talent" for his literary reputation and profound learning. He had a close relationship with Hu Shih in his early years, and Hu's hometown of Jixi is a neighboring county of She. In addition, people in southern Anhui believe that the war cannot be dragged on any longer, and they will soon jointly express a concrete opinion publicly.

### Agricultural Demonstration in Zhejiang

— Our Correspondent Jiang Feng

[Our Newspaper Jinhua Dispatch, 22nd] In the autumn of last year, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization took a liking to Zhejiang and planned to work with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Zhejiang Provincial Government to build Zhejiang into an agricultural demonstration province. Thus, the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Extension Committee was established in response to this need. There are seven members of the committee, and a supervisory office was established under the committee as the implementing agency for the project. After deliberations by many experts, twenty-five counties, including Hang County, were selected as demonstration areas in the Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Jinhua areas, with Jinhua as the center. The steps were discussed very thoroughly, and the plan was drawn up very carefully, but later, due to funding problems, the plan was largely "called off." However, since the drums and gongs had already been sounded, it had to be done, so the demonstration area was reduced, leaving only Xiaoshan, Haining, Yuhang, and Hangzhou for implementation. Since the beginning of September, each county has been raising funds and adding technical personnel under the extremely difficult circumstances of the county's finances, scattering them in the fields or rural areas to work on the ground.

In the past four months, the demonstration areas of the above-mentioned three counties and one city have carried out the following tasks:

(1) Rice Preservation. Over the years, the pure-line rice varieties promoted by each county have gradually become mixed and inferior. After the establishment of the demonstration area, efforts were made to encourage counties and cities to strengthen guidance to farmers in carrying out field preservation work, eliminating the false and inferior, totaling 630 mu. After implementation, the purity has been increased to over 95%, and it is planned to be used for special contract breeding of original seeds next year.

(2) Wheat Promotion: The wheat promotion work is carried out in conjunction with the Zhejiang Province Food Production Increase Plan, with a promotion area of 17,450 mu.

(3) Tobacco Improvement: Xiaoshan introduced 50 mu of American tobacco "Foguang" variety and plans to set up a small-scale tobacco curing house for improvement demonstration.

(4) Yellow Ramie Preservation: Haining once promoted 25,000 mu of Indian ramie, but because its seeds are quite mixed, guidance was provided for seed preservation on 20 mu.

(5) Vegetable Disease and Insect Control: Hangzhou City carried out vegetable disease and insect control, introducing the use of sprayers and guiding the application of 237 jin of derris powder, lead arsenate, DDT, and other agents. 213 mu was designated as an insect control demonstration area in the central location, and many villagers imitated and implemented it.

(6) Promoting Improved Sheepfolds: Sheep farming is a common and important sideline for farmers in Haining. The construction of farm sheepfolds has been slightly improved to facilitate ventilation and drainage. An improved demonstration sheepfold has been built on a contract farm in Yuanhua Township to promote it.

(7) Promoting Farmland Water Conservancy: Assisting Xiaoshan in dredging and reclaiming Xiang Lake, and the first phase of dike construction and water pumping is currently underway. Farmers' groups in Haining purchased five water pumps and launched voluntary labor to dredge river ports.

(8) Holding Farmer Training Classes: In order to utilize the agricultural slack season, impart practical skills, and increase farmers' interest in improving agricultural affairs, various agricultural life training classes have been held in each demonstration area since the end of November, lasting for five to seven days, totaling seven locations, with a total of 274 young farmers participating.

The pilot of the agricultural demonstration area is the first of its kind in China. Although much work has been done in just four months, the performance of the results is still not satisfactory.

Based on past experience, the supervisory office of the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Extension Committee has formulated five principles as the basis for future work, after reviewing the gains and losses of the extension work in recent months.

(1) Business design should target the entire life of farmers, promote in multiple directions, and suit the interests and needs of farmers, not just limited to technical improvements.

(2) The implementation area and objects must be concentrated, taking agricultural extension as the center and starting point, and coordinating with water conservancy, land administration, education, health, organization and training, and agricultural loans and other facilities, depending on the local environment, to achieve great results.

(3) Agricultural extension is a kind of educational service work, neither a charitable undertaking nor a routine matter. Administrative power from top to bottom should be used less, and more teaching methods should be used to inspire farmers' awareness of improvement.

(4) Rural construction should be based on farmers as the main body, and the interest and ability of farmers to automate should be cultivated to tap the potential of farmers and achieve the goal of self-reliance.

(5) Agricultural construction is the basis of all governance. After the foundation is stable, it can take root locally after being guided and improved. Special attention should be paid to the cultivation and training of rural leaders and the strengthening of county and township autonomous organizations.

Millions of farmers are waiting for this "flower of agricultural extension demonstration," planted on the fertile soil of Zhejiang, to bear fruit soon.
