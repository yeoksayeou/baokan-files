### Xu Kan Goes to the Capital for Final Instructions; New Economic Plan to be Announced; Free Trade of Gold and Silver to Enhance Currency Credibility

[Our Newspaper Report] Finance Minister Xu Kan was still in Shanghai yesterday dealing with important matters. The work of seeking minor opinions before the implementation of the new economic plan has come to an end. Mr. Xu went to the capital last night or at the latest this morning to meet with Acting President Li and provide final instructions on the matter. According to sources close to Mr. Xu, the existence of the new plan is no longer a question, and the free and open trading of gold and silver will indeed help enhance currency credibility, at least in the short term. Yesterday afternoon, the city's financial market clearly felt the impact of this new plan. Financial commodities fell by about 20% within 20 minutes in the afternoon due to the transmission of certain confirmed information. As for when the measures will be officially announced, there is much speculation from the outside world. According to the plan, Mr. Xu must also go to Guangzhou to submit the new plan to the Political Affairs Conference on the 19th for approval. The most likely time for the announcement should be early next week.

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou Dispatch, 17th] According to reliable sources, the authorities are determined to reform financial and economic policies, will use all their strength to stabilize currency values, and absorb idle capital in order to establish gold yuan credit, thereby cracking down on local currency system reform plans being carried out in various places. As for the content of the new reform plan, it will be announced as soon as Minister Xu returns to Guangzhou. The Ministry of Finance spokesperson also denied the rumor that silver coins would be issued, saying that there are currently no signs to prove that silver coins may be adopted. In addition, the business community here has requested the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to abolish the overly strict export control system for several days. Recently, the person in charge of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce stated that the Ministry has consulted with the Ministry of Finance to effectively improve the measures. It is also learned that after the new policy is implemented, all past measures such as export foreign exchange settlement and foreign exchange transfer will be abolished.

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou Dispatch, 17th] The Guangdong Provincial Assembly Standing Committee once passed a proposal by Ou Yi-ming and others, requesting the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters to restrict the entry of gold yuan notes into Guangdong and prohibit the circulation of Hong Kong dollars in order to stabilize finance and stabilize prices, based on previous methods. The Assembly sent a telegram to the Pacification Headquarters, requesting its execution. The Pacification Headquarters currently believes that the number of gold yuan notes carried by passengers into Guangdong should be executed in accordance with the proposal. In addition, the Guangzhou Financial Management Bureau and the Guangdong Customs have been strictly ordered to strictly enforce the ban on the free flow and sale of Hong Kong dollars.

### Proposed Solutions to the Requirements of the Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Association

[Our Newspaper Report] The eight requirements submitted by the Silver, Money, and Trust Industry Association to Finance Minister Xu Kan the week before last, it is heard that the National Bank and the Financial Management Bureau have formulated solutions based on the actual situation, and they can be implemented immediately after being approved by the Ministry of Finance. The key points of the requirements put forward by the silver and money industry are as follows: (1) The balance of cashier's checks should be exempt from being sent to the National Bank, and the banks should be responsible for them themselves. (2) The daily exchange balance should be transferred to the joint reserve car. The authorities believe that there is no problem in principle with the above two points, but they are worthy of research technically. They will not be implemented before Zhu Nanchang of the National Bank leaves, and are not currently considered. (3) Please return the foreign exchange portion of the declared foreign exchange assets. Due to environmental reasons, there is no possibility of implementation for the time being. (4) The valuation of US dollar public bonds in the deposit reserve. In principle, the authorities have agreed to modify it, changing the original exchange rate of 20 to 1. The new ratio will be determined after discussion. (5) Regarding the interest on deposit reserves, it has been increased from 12% to 15%. (6) The association can adjust the interest rates on bank deposits and loans at any time according to market conditions. (7) The capital verification procedures after the bank's capital increase are currently being expedited and can be completed this month. (8) The use of the cash portion of the bank's capital increase has been carried out in batches in accordance with the original plan.

### The Government Proposes a Three-Year Aid-to-China Plan to the United States; Rumor Says $600 Million Loan Has Been Approved

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou Dispatch, 17th] According to reliable sources, the US$600 million loan to China from the United States has been approved by the US, and it is said that both parties have signed a contract, but officials have not confirmed it.

[United Press Guangzhou Dispatch, 17th] Executive Yuan President Sun Ke told a reporter from this agency yesterday that he does not believe that President Chiang will make a comeback. When the reporter asked whether Mr. Sun thought that Mr. Chiang would actively lead the government again, Mr. Sun solemnly replied: "No, Mr. Chiang intends to retire for a long time." Mr. Sun met with reporters at his new official residence in Chengnan. It was the first time Mr. Sun had hosted foreign reporters since the government moved south. Mr. Sun denied that he had disagreements with Acting President Li, saying that the actions of the cabinet moving south were completely consistent with Acting President Li. It is expected that other major administrative agencies remaining in Beijing will move to Guangdong with the cabinet, and Acting President Li will also visit Guangdong, but the exact date has not been determined. The personnel of the President's Office and a portion of the files have already been transported here. Acting President Li's preparation to come to Guangdong proves that the cabinet's move to Guangzhou was not a decision made solely by the cabinet, but was made after the entire government consulted with Acting President Li and obtained his consent. Meetings of the Legislative Yuan should not be held in Shanghai or Nanjing, but should be held in Guangzhou. Holding meetings in Guangdong can guarantee that they will not be interfered with by the Communist Party. About 120 members of the Legislative Yuan from Taiwan have expressed their willingness to hold meetings in Guangzhou with 100 members of the Legislative Yuan from the southwestern provinces. About 60 members of the Legislative Yuan from Guangdong advocate holding a vote in Guangzhou to decide where to hold meetings. This proposal has a democratic style. Mr. Sun did not pay attention to the fact that the Control Yuan resumed its meeting in Nanjing yesterday, saying only that a plenary meeting will be held in March. Mr. Sun emphasized that Guangzhou is suitable as the capital, smiling and saying, "Once Nanjing becomes too hot and uninhabitable, I believe ambassadors from various countries will also come to Guangzhou." When talking about the issue of peace talks, Mr. Sun said that the cabinet has not thoroughly discussed or decided on the terms of peace talks, and there has been no news since the Shanghai peace delegation went to Beiping. I absolutely believe that Acting President Li will never accept any peace terms that are tantamount to surrender. The Chinese Communist Party opposes mediation by United Nations agencies. I don’t know the reason, but it is also a good thing if direct negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can achieve a fair and honorable peace. Mr. Sun denied rumors that he had resigned, believing that they were speculation by some reporters in Shanghai, but in fact there was no such thing. Mr. Sun revealed that the government had submitted two plans to the Economic Cooperation Administration, requesting continued assistance after the current aid-to-China plan expires on April 3 this year. This was proposed by former Executive Yuan President Weng Wenhao when ECA Director Paul G. Hoffman came to China in December last year. One of them requested an allocation of US$80 million as a temporary advance payment from April 3 to the end of the fiscal year in late June. The other requested the United States to implement a three-year aid-to-China plan, from July 1949 to June 1952, with a total cost of 3 billion yuan, similar in nature to the aid-to-Europe plan. The Economic Cooperation Administration's US$70 million aid-to-China construction plan had been suspended, but the construction funds for the railways in Taiwan and South China will be restored. I recently raised this issue in person when ECA branch director Lapham visited Guangdong. I also requested the ECA to allocate US$3.5 million to complete the Huangpu Port project. The cabinet allocated the same amount of funds at the meeting yesterday morning to improve the port so that it can accommodate 10,000-ton ships. The entire project can be completed within one year.

Mr. Acheson mentioned the situation in China at the meeting, and when reporters asked questions, he reluctantly replied: He and Ambassador Gu discussed matters of great interest to both China and the United States, but no decisions were made.

### Location of Legislative Yuan Session Still Awaiting Final Decision

Mr. Tong originally planned to return to Beijing by night train on the 16th, but the workers' strike on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway was unsuccessful, and he has now changed his plan to return to Beijing on the 18th. Chen Kewen, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, contacted President Tong by long-distance telephone on the evening of the 17th, but because President Tong was out and had not returned, he only spoke to his secretary.

[Central News Agency Taipei Dispatch, 17th] The members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan in Taiwan have not yet responded to the resolution of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan to hold meetings in Beijing.

They will meet again within a few days to discuss the matter. Some members of the Legislative Yuan said that there are more than 100 members of the Legislative Yuan in Beijing and Shanghai, and a total of more than 180 members in Guangzhou and other places.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] More than 1,000 Communist troops from the Jiang Gao and Xishan independent regiments and the Yangzhou Gu Weihang unit sneaked into the Shijiaqiao area, the forward bridgehead of the National Army south of Yangzhou, on the night of the 16th. After the National Army's Wang Zuohua unit blocked and attacked for two hours, the Communist troops were unable to resist and retreated north after suffering more than 200 casualties. In addition, 4,000 Communist troops from the Yangtze River Column suddenly arrived in Jingjiang City from Huangqiao on the 15th. The National Army's bridgehead on the other side of Jiangyin, Bazhou, has been put on alert.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The Yangtze River Column of the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu is currently actively building Jiang defense works in the section along the river from Nantong to Langshan Junshan. At the same time, the port facilities of Tiangshenggang, Lujinggang, and Rengang have been completely destroyed in order to prevent landings.

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang Dispatch, 17th] Two units of the Communist Army's New Sixth Regiment and the Xinghua Independent Regiment, totaling about 2,000 people, attacked the Shijiaqiao National Army position north of Liuyu at 10:00 last night. The garrison fought back, and the artillery battle lasted all night. By dawn today, the Communist Army had retreated. There was no contact on the south side of Jiangnan from Yizheng to the port. The National Army is still strengthening its alert, and the Air Force is constantly flying over the north bank of the Yangtze River for reconnaissance.

[Our Newspaper Jiangyin Dispatch, 16th] The Jingjiang Communist Army Independent Regiment and others once engaged in outpost battles with the National Army at Bazhougang and Shizhouqiao, but soon retreated north. It is reported that when the Communist Army entered Jingjiang City, some agency personnel were arrested.

[Our Newspaper Pukou Dispatch, 17th] About 100 Communist troops in He County once harassed the Wujiang National Army bridgehead at midnight on the 16th.

As for the Jinpu Front East-West Ge area, it was still quiet and there were no battles on the 16th and 17th.

[Associated Press Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The Communist Army, which is lined up on the north bank of the Yangtze River like giant herons with outstretched wings, has not yet exerted pressure on the National Army's bridgehead still on the north bank. According to military sources here on the 17th, this fact indicates that the Communist Army has no intention of forcibly crossing the Yangtze River in the near future. These people believe that the Communist Army's crossing offensive will take the form of a concentrated attack, most likely in Wuhu, because the Communist Army may establish an attack line straight to Hangzhou here to cut off the retreat of the National Army in the Nanjing-Shanghai area. They said: The Communist Army's consistent strategy is not to capture cities as the main goal, but to annihilate the main force of the National Army on the battlefield. If the Communist Army directly attacks Nanjing and Shanghai from the front without cutting off the retreat, the National Army will be able to retreat south when necessary. On the other hand, the reduction of the Communist Army's pressure may be considered as the Communist Party's understanding that crossing the river will require a large sacrifice of manpower, and peace talks may avoid this sacrifice. If the peace talks are successful, the Communist Party can cross the Yangtze River without spending a single soldier.

Military sources said that there are currently no signs of the Communist Army under Lin Biao moving south from the Pingjin area, but when the final crossing offensive must begin, it is very possible for Lin Biao's troops to move south. As for the Communist Army under Chen Yi, it is currently gathering in Huaian, Tianchang, Chuxian, Chaoxian and other places for reorganization.

### Shanghai Peace Representatives Yan Huiqing and Others May Meet with Mao Zedong; CCP Broadcast Calls the Release of Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng a "Farce"; Wu Yuhou and Others Meet with President Sun in Guangzhou

Editorial

### Maintain Traffic and Stabilize Society!

Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou are located south of the Yangtze River, where transportation has always been convenient. Until now, they are still separated from the war zone by the Yangtze River. However, the transportation situation has fallen into chaos in the past two months and is trending downward. As a result, public transportation in Shanghai is often suspended due to various reasons. Especially in the past two weeks, the situation has worsened, and the chaos in traffic order has reached an extreme. On the first day of this month, the French tram once stopped running, and the dispatching offices of two tram lines were destroyed. On the second day, the French tram's workshop was destroyed. On the third day, French tram drivers and ticket sellers clashed with soldiers, resulting in a strike to protest. On the eighth day, workers of the two tram lines surrounded the management bureau to demand better treatment, and all trains were completely suspended. On the same day, public bus employees went on a slowdown due to wage issues. On the ninth day, the labor unrest on the two tram lines resurfaced, and the vehicles on both lines were suspended again. On the 15th and 16th, the labor unrest on the two tram lines expanded, with 6,000 workers collectively petitioning, and the vehicles on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines were suspended all day. On the same day, public bus employees in the city went on strike again because their request for emergency funds was not met. In addition, incidents such as petitioning groups obstructing traffic, or passengers rushing and squeezing onto vehicles, resulting in falls, injuries, and deaths, are common occurrences, truly making people lament the difficulty of moving even a step.

Such a situation would be understandable if it occurred on the day when enemy troops were at the city walls. It would also not be surprising if it occurred in a remote area with traffic congestion. But at this time and place, with the communist army stationed north of the Yangtze River and showing no signs of crossing it, and with the river defenses as solid as a rock, south of the Yangtze River is as stable as a mountain. The people certainly do not need to rush and seize transportation, and the regulatory agencies should calmly dispatch and maintain order. Even if there is a military need, extra trains should be added in sequence. As for the general employees of transportation agencies, although their treatment is meager, it should not be worse than that of ordinary public school teachers and government employees. Even if skyrocketing prices make it impossible to make a living, they should legally apply for adjustments and improvements. These are problems that should be directly negotiated between employees and supervisors, and are internal affairs of the transportation agencies. However, the responsible authorities could not prevent problems from occurring, nor could they properly handle and resolve disputes when they did occur, ultimately causing the labor unrest to drag on and expand repeatedly. The employees, on the other hand, did not consider the overall situation and resorted to slowdowns, strikes, petitions, and encirclements as means of coercion. This resulted in vehicles being suspended several times a day, and public transportation coming to a standstill. What is even more strange is that there are clear announcements prohibiting strikes and concentrated coercion, but they are treated as waste paper. Such disarray and chaos, such shouting and clamoring, what kind of system is this, what kind of society is this! At the same time, news is coming from Tianjin that railway transportation centered on Beiping seems to be gradually recovering. Regardless of how the Communist Party handles these issues, its administrative efficiency exceeds that of our government, which even people in the government cannot deny.

Although the unrest on the two tram lines was largely resolved yesterday, the factors of social unrest still exist, and such unrest is likely to continue to arise here and there. Looking at our country, which is on the verge of storms and turmoil, on the brink of collapse, it is also at a critical juncture for revival. The central government is sincerely seeking peace and striving to reform politics. All agencies, organizations, employees, and people throughout the country should share the burden, work together, overcome the current difficulties, and move forward towards the future of reforming politics and improving the economy. In particular, maintaining public transportation and stabilizing social order is the responsibility of everyone.

The quality of social atmosphere is originally tied to the morale of the people. If the entire society is filled with violence, selfishness, contention, and rascality, resulting in shouting, fighting, and destruction, and all that is seen everywhere is chaos, and the authorities are only greedy and incompetent, then where have the human virtues of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame gone? And what is the point of the state establishing official positions and assigning duties, and the local authorities issuing proclamations of martial law? As for national consciousness and social concepts, there is even less to talk about!

We fervently hope that Acting President Li will rectify official misconduct and military discipline, and achieve the goal of reforming politics. We also hope that reforming politics will not forget to improve the economy, stabilize currency value, curb price increases, and improve the salaries and benefits of public school teachers, government employees, and general wage earners. In particular, maintaining public transportation and stabilizing social order are matters of utmost urgency. In this regard, we also hope that all compatriots throughout the country will repeatedly reflect on Guanzi's words on the four pillars of the state, and cooperate with political reform and economic improvement to jointly transform the social atmosphere.

### Communist Party Has Not Stopped Military Actions; Scattered Battles in Various Regions; Ministry of National Defense Announces Weekly War Situation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th Dispatch] The Ministry of National Defense recently announced the weekly war situation from the 10th to the 16th as follows:

In the past week, the government has continued to sincerely seek peace, but the Communist Party has not stopped its military actions. Here is a summary of the scattered battles in various regions: On the Yangtze River front, the Communist forces of Chen Yi's unit north of the Yangtze River have been moving south along the entire line since the 13th (the day after the Lantern Festival). They are currently gathering in Gaoyou, Tianchang, Mingguang, Chaoxian, Hefei, and other places. There are currently no main Communist forces in the area north of Bengbu and Huaiyin, and the situation in the Liangpu area has not changed significantly. A small number of Communist troops are appearing near Wuyi. The 6th and 7th Columns of Chen Yi's unit are currently being reorganized and replenished near Hefei. In the areas of Chaoxian and Hexian, the number of Communist troops has also been increasing in recent days, and their activities are more active than before. All ships, horses, fuel, food, and young men in the vicinity have been requisitioned. It appears that the Communist forces in that area are actively replenishing new recruits and collecting food, preparing to cross the river. As for the small number of local Communists near Caishi, they have been cleared by the National Army. In the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, a unit of the National Army launched a continuous counterattack against Tianshengang, Nantong, starting on the 10th, inflicting considerable damage on the Communist forces. Now that the mission has been accomplished, they have safely returned to their original defenses. The situation in the requisition has stabilized, and the Communist forces have withdrawn 15 li. Order in the area has returned to normal. Around the Jiangyin Fortress, our army and navy are strictly defending. Rumors that small groups of Communist troops had secretly crossed the river are absolutely untrue.

In Central China, the Communist forces of Chen Geng's unit on the Han-Ying Line are still in the Tanghe area, without major changes. There is no Communist activity around Xinyang, Queshan, and Zhumadian. A unit of Communist forces circled southwards the week before. The 10th Column, Jianghan Column, and New 1st Brigade, commanded by Li Xiannian, infiltrated Jingmen after invading it, and then infiltrated near Shilipu and Tuanlinpu. The National Army recovered Jingmen at 10:00 AM on the 16th. The Communist troops originally based in Jingmen fled eastward. In order to ensure the safety of the periphery of Yichang and Shashi, our army is dividing its forces to attack Li Renlin's unit of Communist troops in the area southeast of Xionggou and Zheluhe. In addition, the National Army in Anlu, Yingcheng, Jiangling, and other places is also launching clearing operations in the surrounding areas to block the Communist forces' local offensives and protect the safety of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. In other areas, there were no major battles in Taiyuan and northern Shaanxi this week. The government has made its utmost efforts to seek overall peace. Whether or not a peaceful ceasefire can be achieved now faces the final test of whether the Communist Party is sincere about peace.

### Xie Nanguang Speaks on the Current Situation in Japan

Believes It Is Extremely Easy to Restore Armaments

[Our Taipei, 17th Dispatch] Xie Nanguang, a member of our delegation to Japan, was invited by the Information Office today to speak to the press about the current situation in Japan. Xie said: The Allied Forces have controlled Japan for more than three years, and the armaments of the army, navy, and air force seem to have been dismantled on the surface. In fact, however, various military facilities have only been expanded. Taking the air force airfield as an example, Tokyo now has an airfield that can accommodate 500 B-17 Flying Fortresses. The crackdown on financial cliques is also incomplete. Therefore, it is extremely easy for Japan to restore its armaments. To prevent its aggression from rekindling, our country must insist on veto power when signing the peace treaty. Xie also mentioned that the Allied Forces' control has succeeded in two areas: first, the Emperor's system exists in name only; second, land reform has been quite effective.

### Change of Director at Yuehan Railway Bureau; A Movement to Retain Du Occurs

[Our Changsha, 17th Dispatch] Du Zhenyuan has resigned from the position of Director of the Yuehan Railway Bureau, and Yuan Menghong has been appointed to succeed him.

It is heard that Yuan is from Guangdong, and some Guangdong employees do not sympathize with the anti-Yuan movement, and a movement to welcome Yuan may occur.

[Our Hankou, 17th Dispatch] Infighting has broken out among the employees of the Yuehan Railway. Some employees have organized a road protection movement, advocating for the retention of Director Du Zhenyuan and demanding that the Ministry of Communications withdraw its order for Yuan Menghong to take over the railway. They also claimed that the resignation of the heads of the bureaus was instigated by a few people. However, other employees believe that Du's perfunctory actions have led to the railway's decline and that Du should not be retained.

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 17th Dispatch] Lu Han, Chairman of Yunnan and Commander of the Peace Preservation Forces, believes that the incident on the 12th in which the Kunming Central Bank was mobbed was due to the ineffective leadership of the bank's manager, Wu Yong, the arrogance and impoliteness of the staff, improper handling of affairs, and the failure of the gendarmerie and police authorities to fulfill their duties, leading to the escalation of the situation. After a thorough investigation by the Peace Preservation Forces Headquarters, the following punishments were decided: Kunming Mayor Zeng Nianhuai and Police Preservation Chief Li Yuzhen were given reprimands; Wang Wei, Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, was given one major demerit; Xie Cheng-zhang, Chief of the First Police Precinct, was removed from his position but retained; Wang Xu, Commander of the 13th Gendarmerie Regiment, was given one major demerit; Wu Yong, Manager of the Central Bank, was given one major demerit and ordered to thoroughly investigate and report the inappropriate staff behavior that led to the incident, so that severe punishment can be imposed in separate cases.

### Some Huainan Coal Mine Workers Transferred to Jiangxi for Work

[Our Nanchang, 17th Dispatch] After the Huainan Coal Mine fell under the control of the Communist Party, the supply of Jiangnan coal has become increasingly difficult. The mine's remaining 150,000 tons of coal and all equipment have not been evacuated. It is now planned to transfer some of the miners, about 150 people, to Leping to participate in the Jiangnan Coal Mine work. Production will be increased through competition, and the highest daily output may reach 200 tons in the future. Mining expert Wang Dezi has arrived in the province and will go to Leping to plan increased production. Also, due to the Lunar New Year, many miners in the Jiangxi Coal Mine have returned to their hometowns, and production has generally decreased, with a current daily output of 100 tons. The coal used along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway mostly relies on Pingxiang coal supply, which is also feeling inadequate. In the future, if the Zhangshu Muqiao cannot run, the use of ferries will make the coal supply problem in Jiangxi more serious. The Provincial Department of Construction has decided to strengthen the production of the Tianhe and Beicheng Mines to cope with the industrial coal use in Jiangxi.

### One Week Visit to Southern Henan: People South of Zhumadian Can Freely Discuss Peace Issues

[Special Dispatch from Xinyang, 16th of the Month] The reporter's summary of the situation on various fronts in southern Henan over the past week is as follows: (1) The seven columns of the Communist army—the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 9th, 10th, and 11th—that remain stranded on both sides of the Shahe River in southern Henan and on the northern, eastern, and western sides of Zhumadian are still actively replenishing their forces. In Luohe, 56 kilometers from Zhumadian, there are also over 10,000 newly organized troops from the Nationalist 10th Army. The Communist 1st and 3rd Columns on the eastern side of the Pinghan Railway are encircling the two divisions of Huang Wei's army corps, which were forced to surrender during the Xubeng Campaign but have not yet handed over their weapons, with a watchful attitude, slowly attempting to absorb them. It seems difficult for them to withdraw and advance southward in the short term. As for the two columns that have already advanced to the southwestern area of Wuyang, reconnaissance reports from aircraft indicate that a portion of them had crossed the Tang River on the 15th and fled toward Wuxiangfan, seemingly to coordinate with Communist forces operating on the periphery of Shayi. (2) Zhengyang has turned from danger to safety. Although the 7th Regiment of the 4th Security Brigade, which guards the south gate of the city, has suffered casualties, the 1st Security Brigade and the Communist White Horse and Black Horse Cavalry Regiments suffered very little loss in the 48-hour battle of attack and defense. This shows that the morale of the National Army on the front lines has improved compared to before. Furthermore, in Minggang, 90 li from Zhengyang, the entire town came out to welcome the reporter group on the 15th. Among the welcoming crowd at the station, there were even elders with long beards reaching their chests standing solemnly on the platform, setting off firecrackers to express their welcome. The reporters were deeply ashamed, as the 5th Bao of the town had over ten villages destroyed and over 300 civilians killed or injured by unruly local militias at the beginning of the first month of the lunar calendar. They had grievances but no one to tell. Now that Zhang Tu's army corps, which claims to be the army of the common people, has arrived, they can pour out their grievances to the Shanghai-Hankou reporters about the excellent results of military-civilian cooperation, which is very gratifying. (3) According to merchants from the north: the people south of Zhumadian can freely discuss the issue of peace negotiations, but the opposite is true north of Luohe.

[Special Dispatch from Xiaogan, 16th of the Month] After a 600-li visit to the war zone in southern Henan with colleagues from Wuhan, our reporter returned to Xiaogan from Xinyang at 4:00 PM on the 16th to meet with the military and political authorities of the 6th Security District and plans to travel to Changjiangbu, the economic heart of central China, and Yingcheng, the outpost of Wuhan, within the next few days to interview the local military and civilians.

### Building a Large-Scale Air Defense Network from the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean: The US Prepares to Supply Britain with a Large Number of Flying Fortresses

[United Press, London, 17th of the Month] The countries of the Western European Union are currently establishing a large-scale radar air defense network, from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Mediterranean Sea in the south. This can be seen in the British government's defense white paper released yesterday. It is said that Britain has provided ground radar equipment to France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg to complete a unified air defense network. According to official sources, a radar air defense headquarters will soon be established, under whose command will be all air defense stations from Lübeck, a Baltic port in the British-occupied zone of Germany, to the French Mediterranean coast. The radar air defense stations in the British-occupied zone of Germany will also be incorporated into this air defense network.

[United Press International, London, 16th of the Month] The Western European Union is stepping up the construction of a radar wall to defend against any unexpected air raids. The British government's white paper hints that an electronic "Eastern Wall" is being built. British sources say that concealed radar stations will be set up along the borders of the five countries and very closely spaced to form an invisible net capable of detecting even small rockets and enemy aircraft. If any suspicious aerial activity is detected, headquarters will immediately order each station to track the suspicious aircraft while simultaneously ordering fighters and anti-aircraft guns to prepare for combat. This system can double the effectiveness of the air defense network that inflicted heavy damage on German aircraft during the war.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th of the Month] The "Daily Telegraph" reported today that the British and American governments are currently negotiating the transfer of 150 American B-29 Flying Fortresses to the Royal Air Force. It also stated that this is the reason why the new bomber was not mentioned in the British defense white paper released on the 15th.

### Atlantic Pact Negotiations Underway: The US Reiterates Policies and Objectives: No Disagreement Between Government and Congress

[United Press, Washington, 16th of the Month] Secretary of State Acheson firmly stated today that the US attitude toward the North Atlantic Pact has not changed. Acheson did not specify what specific obligations the US will undertake in the pact, only stating that it is still under negotiation.

Acheson repeatedly mentioned the US objectives and policies for the pact, saying that on this point, there is no disagreement between the State Department and Senators Connally and Vandenberg, the bipartisan foreign policy leaders in the Senate. We are conducting negotiations with the relevant countries in accordance with a clearly defined policy. This policy was recently revealed by President Truman in his inaugural address and was initially seen in the resolutions passed by both houses of Congress last June. This is the so-called Vandenberg Resolution, "In principle, the United States, in accordance with constitutional procedures, participates in regional and other collective measures, provided that such measures are based on continuous and effective self-help and mutual assistance and are related to the security of the United States." The resolution also stated that these measures should be in accordance with the purposes, principles, and provisions of the United Nations Charter for self-defense.

Validity Period of 20 Years

As for the duration of the pact, the countries have not yet reached an agreement and are still discussing it together. European countries generally advocate a term of fifty years, while the State Department believes that it should not exceed twenty years, but can be renewed upon expiration.

Security Guarantee Clause

[United Press, Washington, 16th of the Month] Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, advocated that the security guarantee clause in the North Atlantic Security Treaty should be stipulated as follows: "If one of the signatory countries encounters an armed attack, the other relevant countries, in order to exercise the right of collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, may individually or jointly take necessary measures to maintain the security of the North Atlantic region." It has not yet been determined whether the State Department is satisfied with the wording of this provision. Acheson recently said, "Our greatest contribution, together with the relevant countries, to maintaining peace is to declare in advance that any country that launches an armed attack on our security will be met with overwhelming force."

### Turkey Advocates Concluding a Mediterranean Alliance

### Indonesian Committee Requests a Two-Week Extension to Propose a New Dutch-Indonesian Plan: The Security Council Passed It Without a Formal Vote

[United Press, Lake Success, 16th of the Month] The United Nations Security Council today, unwilling to oppose the Soviet Union, passed the request of the Indonesian Incident Mediation Committee without a formal vote, giving it two weeks of extra time to draft a new plan to resolve the Dutch-Indonesian dispute. Previously, Soviet representative Malik declared that if the Security Council approved this request, it would be tantamount to condoning the Dutch military's aggression against Indonesia. The Dutch military will take advantage of the postponement of discussions to carry out further aggression.

[United Press International, Washington, 16th of the Month] Secretary of State Acheson told a press conference on the 16th that the United States will not take any action on the Indonesian issue until the US representative to the United Nations Mediation Committee submits a report.

### Royall Did Announce in Tokyo That the US Was Considering Withdrawing from Japan, He Doubted Japan's Value in a War Against the Soviet Union, Royall Denied It Again in Washington

[United Press Reporter Kristoff, Tokyo, 17th of the Month] Secretary of the Army Royall's straightforward denial that he had told American reporters here that the United States would withdraw US troops stationed in Japan in a war against the Soviet Union, and his statement that he had never authorized the release of this information without disclosing his name, are inconsistent with his talk to twelve American reporters at the American Embassy here on February 6. The reporter is one of these twelve people, and although there is no record of the entire meeting at hand, the key points extracted by the reporter and other reporters confirm that the information we released is not incorrect. Regarding the possible withdrawal from Japan, Royall said: "The headquarters is now reconsidering Japan's military value. I have deep doubts about Japan's value in a war against the Soviet Union. I think it may be better to withdraw from Japan before the war starts, but no decision has been made yet. Any announcement regarding this suggestion is not yet ripe. This matter may be announced in January or mid-February, but I cannot be sure. I am not sure whether we can retain Japan. Similarly, while we possess the Ryukyu and the Philippines, I am not sure whether it is worthwhile to retain Japan. The Ryukyu and the Philippines are safer than Japan. In these two places, we can conduct strategic air attacks without having to bear the responsibility of feeding Japan's 80 million people." Regarding this important issue, the reporter compared his own notes with those of Chicago Daily News reporter Peachy and International News Service Far East Manager Hentermann, and the results were completely identical. Royall said that any form of strict telegram and decisive battle bound by Asia will be won in Europe. He said: "But if we are driven out of Western Europe, it will take fifteen to thirty years to return to Western Europe, but even if we lose Alaska and the Aleutians, there is still an easier way to attack the United States. At the same time, the US air bases in Western Europe, Britain, or even Iceland can achieve strategic goals far better than Alaska or the Far East." Royall said that he doubted whether a war would break out in the Far East or whether the Soviet Union would invade Japan and bear the responsibility of supporting Japan's 80 million people. He also said: "In my opinion, we have no obligation to Japan. The impression of the war is still fresh in our minds. I don't think we have any moral or other obligation to protect the Japanese people." Then Royall told the reporters that he thought it might be better to withdraw from Japan before the war broke out. Royall mentioned at least twice that the US Army was reviewing the entire US situation in the Pacific. He said that China controlled by the Chinese Communists is not a special military asset to the Soviet Union, or a threat to the United States.

[United Press, Washington, 16th of the Month] Secretary of the Army Royall, following a statement by Secretary of State Acheson today, again bluntly denied at a press conference that he had said that if the Soviet Union invaded Japan, the US military would abandon the area. Royall said, "What I said was the opposite, that the United States does not intend to change the strength of US troops stationed in Japan and is prepared to deal with any aggression." The reporter then asked about various issues reported in Tokyo, and Royall replied, "Although I met with many reporters on the 6th, I did not discuss the strategy of the US military in Japan." When asked if anyone else present at the time had made the statement, Royall said: "As far as I remember, no one said that if a war broke out, the United States would withdraw from Japan." When asked whether Deputy Chief of Staff Wedemeyer, who accompanied him to Japan, or officials from MacArthur's headquarters were present, Royall replied: "No."

[United Press International, Washington, 16th of the Month] US Secretary of the Army Royall admitted on the 16th that the "senior US official" who held discussions with newspaper reporters in Tokyo was Royall himself.

### Public Bus Strike in the City Ends: Three Employees Executed by Firing Squad, Another Six Drivers and Ticket Sellers Sentenced to Imprisonment, Full Service Expected to Resume Today

[Report] The Garrison Command executed three employees of the Public Transportation Bus Company of the Public Utilities Bureau yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM: Zhong Quanzhou, a worker in the maintenance yard; Gu Bokang, driver of car number 944; and Wang Yuan, driver of car number 381. According to the Garrison Command's announcement: the three men "took the lead in gathering the masses on February 16 of this year, making unreasonable demands on the company for 6 shi of rice for contingency expenses and 1 shi of rice for meal subsidies, and inciting all employees to strike. At the same time, they incited the French-owned tram to stop running, and all roads of transportation were suddenly cut off, disrupting order and endangering public safety to the utmost extent. They have been arrested and interrogated about the previous situation. During this period of martial law, Gu Bokang and others dared to coerce the public and disrupt security. The headquarters had no choice but to enforce the law and sentenced them to death."

Gu Bokang was 39 years old, from Zhuji, Xinjiang; Zhong Quanzhou was 30 years old, from Zhenhai, Zhejiang; and Wang Yuan was 31 years old, from Zhenhai, Zhejiang. The three were arrested and sent to the Garrison Command at 3:00 AM yesterday morning. After being tried by the Military Law Department in the morning, they were presented to Commander Chen for approval and sentenced to death.

At 6:00 PM, the three were taken from the detention center. The executioner told them that they were ordered to be executed. Gu Bokang burst into tears upon hearing this. Zhong Quanzhou and Wang Yuan were both terrified. The three still hoped that the company authorities would rescue them, but the judge told them that it was impossible. Then, they jointly wrote a will, mainly asking the company to prove their usual actions and previous acceptance of orders to mediate for the company. Finally, after each was injected with anesthesia and drank sorghum liquor, they were escorted onto a prison car and rushed to the execution ground, where they were killed by several shots.

Those who were arrested at the same time as Gu Bokang and others included drivers and ticket sellers Wang Qiuping, Zhu Fusheng, Shen Pengjie, Yu Qinxue, Xu Kuijun, and Wang Changming. Because their circumstances were lighter, they have been sentenced to imprisonment.

[Additional News] Zhao, the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, told reporters yesterday that the public transportation company's employee strike has come to an end. As of yesterday afternoon, more than 2,000 of the company's drivers and ticket sellers had registered with the company to return to work, accounting for 80% of the total number. It is said that the remaining 20% are either those who had already requested leave for personal or medical reasons. It was announced that starting at 4:30 PM yesterday, some buses on lines 3 and 10 had already started running. Director Zhao told reporters with a firm tone that full service can be restored starting tomorrow (i.e., today). The company authorities are currently conducting a review of the qualifications of the employees who have registered to return to work by the Reinstatement Employee Qualification Review Committee and will try to retain all of them unless they have committed serious misconduct in the past.

### Frequent Labor Strikes in This City: Mr. Chen Daqing Speaks, Expressing Four Hopes to All Parties; Disruptive Elements Will Be Strictly Controlled

Recently, labor strikes have been occurring frequently in this city, greatly affecting transportation, production, and social order. Mr. Chen Daqing, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, issued the following statement on this matter:

Recently, labor strikes have been occurring frequently in this city. For example, the workers of the French Tramway Company, the Transportation Company's public buses, and the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways have successively gone on strike. The impact of these strikes is sufficient to cause production to cease, transportation to be interrupted, and society to become uneasy. We should clearly recognize that public utilities such as transportation and state-owned enterprises belong to the state, and their sovereignty belongs to the people. No one can arbitrarily control or obstruct them for any reason. As for private enterprises, factories, and companies, although they are privately owned, their purpose is to serve the people and benefit society. They cannot be arbitrarily monopolized or destroyed for any reason. If someone deliberately incites labor disputes, they are a criminal against society and a public enemy of the people. Based on the above reasons, I would like to express several hopes and requests to all relevant parties: (1) Labor unions in all industries should earnestly guide and train workers to understand that their mission is to serve society and the people, and that they cannot arbitrarily strike and cause social unrest. (2) Capitalists should understand that they exist because of society and should also seek to coexist with society. They should automatically make reasonable adjustments to workers' wages so that they can work with peace of mind. (3) Workers in all industries should recognize the environment and their responsibilities, and strive to work hard. Any demands should only be resolved reasonably and in a reasonable manner. They must not be exploited by others, act emotionally, endanger society, or sacrifice themselves. (4) All schemers and selfish elements who attempt to use workers and youth as tools for factional and political struggles, not hesitating to sacrifice others to satisfy their personal desires, their despicable, insidious, and unscrupulous behavior will ultimately be despised by the people of the whole country.

It is my duty to ensure the safety of all the people in the city. I will adopt all effective methods to strictly punish the few elements who disrupt public order.

### National Bank Suspended Yarn Sales Yesterday: Will Adopt Flexible Policy in the Future

The National Bank's suspension of yarn sales in the market for several consecutive days has led to a continuous surge in yarn and cloth prices. This has raised concerns among all parties. No yarn was sold yesterday.

In other news, the National Bank's suspension of yarn and cloth sales is temporary and may be restored within a day or two. Because the National Bank believes that the price of gold is rising even more sharply, it has significantly increased gold sales. In terms of tightening the money supply, this is actually more effective than selling yarn and cloth.

### Leather Industry in Peril

Raw Material Prices Soaring, Production Costs Increasing

The leather industry in this city is facing a serious crisis: (1) The raw cowhide required for leather production originally came entirely from the Xuzhou-Bengbu area. Now, the source has almost been cut off, causing raw material prices to soar, while the prices of finished products are lower than the cost. (2) The leather production process is extremely complex, constantly requiring several months, poor turnover, and prices change several times a day, making it extremely difficult. (3) Cowhide is also one of the export commodities. When the source is lacking, plus exports, the supply in this city cannot meet the demand, resulting in abnormal adjustments. The industry is currently requesting the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to prohibit the export of cowhide. There are a total of 370 leather factories in this city, of which those engaged in manual leather production account for eight-tenths. Machine-made and semi-machine-made account for one-tenth. The monthly output is estimated at 530,000 pounds of machine-made sole leather, 200,000 pounds of green leather, 180,000 pounds of handmade sole leather, 780,000 pounds of face leather, and other types such as Moroccan leather, Swift leather, and sand factory belts, cowhide suitcase leather, etc., are also produced in considerable quantities, with a monthly requirement of 1.4 million pounds of dry cowhide.

### New York Mile Race: American, Dutch, and Swedish Triad Compete for Victory; Gagliano's Astonishing Performance

[Special Dispatch from New York for This Newspaper] In Madison Square Garden, an intense indoor sports meet is underway. The lights are dazzling, and music is playing, with the national anthems of the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States played in succession. The mile race is about to begin. The Dutchman Sleekuis and the Swede Bengtsson are both famous athletes in the world games. These two national anthems are a tribute to them. The "Wanamaker" mile race has never been won by a foreigner. This year, after the retirement of American mile champion Shutts, no one has emerged to take his place in long-distance running. The only American competitor is the bespectacled 21-year-old young man Gagliano from the University of Wisconsin. Several weeks ago, he had a trial run in Madison and achieved an astonishing time of four minutes and six and one-tenth seconds, only eight-tenths of a second behind Dues's indoor record. If this record holds, many say he has the potential for a shocking creation. After the starting gun, Gagliano, wearing a red jersey, took the lead. At the half-mile mark, the announcer reported his time as two minutes and two seconds. Second place was Sleekuis, closely following. Bengtsson, suffering from a toothache and with his mouth full of penicillin, was dispirited and obviously far behind, giving up the race. At the three-quarter-mile mark, the Dutchman had surged ahead, with a time of three minutes and eight seconds. Gagliano thought to himself that he was confident he could win the final sprint, and he was very sure he could break four minutes and five and three-tenths seconds. On the final 34-yard straight track, he indeed emerged, sprinting like a short-distance runner, and defeated Sleekuis by five yards, with a time of four minutes and nine and five-tenths seconds. Gagliano said that he was a bit out of form tonight and didn't achieve a good result. Before the band had finished playing, the cheers of the Belgians resounded. Biel Van Rief, the world champion in the 5,000 meters, indeed won the two-mile race, with a record of eight minutes and fifty-six and one-tenth seconds, the best result after his wife Rief.

### Talking About the South in the Midst of the Southern Relocation

—Si Ming

The city of Guangzhou in the past three months is vastly different from what it used to be. Amidst this turbulent situation and the talk of the government relocating to the south, officials are gathering here. Although it has only been a short three months, there have already been significant changes.

The surge in civil servants from various regions and "refugees" seeking evacuation has caused a sudden increase in the city's population. As a result, several bustling streets are constantly packed, and the neon lights of various shops at night compete in their splendor to attract customers. This is something that the Shanghai night market, which is in decline, can only dream of. There is no curfew here, and the city is open all night. Due to the population surge, the market has suddenly become prosperous, and the original power supply is no longer sufficient. Therefore, a system of rotational power outages in different areas has been implemented. However, even at night, the lights are still shining brightly, and teahouses, restaurants, theaters, and opera houses are all thriving, making threefold profits. The heavily made-up female servers greet customers with smiles.

Few Cars, Many People

The wealthy individuals with "03" and "04" license plates speed along the asphalt roads covered in dust, along with Guangzhou's "16" license plates. The number of cars, though not small, points to the city's prosperity. The municipal government is preparing to ban the issuance of new car licenses to maintain traffic flow. There are no trams here, only some dilapidated and poorly designed "long-distance buses." With few cars and many people, everyone struggles to squeeze in like sardines. There are full-fare tickets and "military-police" tickets. In reality, the military and police officers are brazenly riding "霸王車" (unpaid), while ordinary citizens are purchasing "military-police" tickets. Only a few young ladies and wives are neither "military-police" nor "public educators" and have no choice but to pay full fare. Whether you buy a ticket or not, as long as you hold your head high and purse your lips, the ticket seller won't dare to ask too many questions. Perhaps this is the servility developed from long-term oppression.

Knowing Only the Country

A few days ago, I went to Huangpu for some business. When I boarded the bus, it was full of people in uniform. As usual, they were riding without tickets. The ticket seller grumbled a few times, which angered them. They started to shout, "Damn it, we've been fighting for years, shedding blood and sweat, and ended up with our families scattered and people dead. We only know the country and don't know our homes. Yet, even riding the bus is frowned upon. It's because the country is poor, not because we don't want to buy tickets!" Hearing this, my heart ached.

A Glimpse of Huangpu
Huangpu, a major southern port and the gateway to Guangzhou, has become even more important after the war. In the past, ships could sail directly into the city, but after years of war, the Pearl River has become shallower. Now, foreign passengers and goods can only be unloaded in Huangpu and then transported to the city by barges or cars. Here, the cradle of the army and the birthplace of the Northern Expedition, the Huangpu Military Academy stands tall. Time is merciless. Although its spirit is immortal, its shell – the school site – is dilapidated. Recently, amidst the talks of relocating the military academy to the south, this muddy little gathering place is bustling and bustling, creating a whole new world.

High-Pressure Living
With Premier Sun's high-pressure living style coming to Guangzhou, the mood of the citizens is particularly heavy. Is there a split between the government and the parliament? Will the peace talks fail? As a result, the Gold Yuan Note depreciates again and again, and prices soar again and again, creating unprecedented volatility and chaos. The common people are gasping for breath under this high-pressure whip. Since Guangzhou is close to Hong Kong, the Hong Kong dollar has become a favorite. Gold shops and "cigarette" vendors are as numerous as carps crossing the river, specializing in the open but forbidden trade of foreign currency. Most prices have been changed to a base point system. In fact, the base point is a disguised Hong Kong dollar base, which is multiplied by the black market exchange rate to convert it into Gold Yuan Notes. This is much more flexible than Shanghai's bi-monthly cost-of-living index. Therefore, it is no longer a daily jump but fluctuates every moment. Even municipal donations and taxes will implement a base point system.

Taking Risks
The bandits in South China have always been known for their ferocity. Security in the suburbs is not guaranteed. The successive hijackings on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway have turned people pale. Even open robberies and petty thefts in the city have become commonplace. After dark, pedestrians in quiet streets and alleys are mostly wary. With the unrestricted rise in prices and a large number of unemployed people, it is no wonder that many people are taking risks these days.

Leisurely Eating
The abundance and novelty of the restaurants here will make your mouth water. It is worth mentioning that there are unique flavors here that you can't find in Shanghai: dog meat, cat meat, snake meat, etc. Because Guangzhou is close to Hong Kong and Macau, there is an abundance of foreign goods, especially the vendors in the bustling areas. The candies, biscuits, and snacks are colorful and varied. The scale of capital is beyond your imagination. Teahouses are busy three times a day and are always crowded with people. A friend from Shanghai asked me, why are the Cantonese so free? Is this a habit of the two Cantonese regions? I had no answer.

Southern Women
If a modern city should be adorned with fashionable women, then Guangzhou is lagging behind. In my three months in Guangzhou, I have rarely seen stylishly dressed ladies. I remember someone saying that French women have charm, German women have health, American women have cuteness, British women have stability, and Japanese women have gentleness, while Shanghai ladies combine all of these qualities. Although this statement is exaggerated, it does show how much they are admired. I don't deny the phrase "Southern beauties." There are many beautiful girls in Shanghai, but from the perspective of a modern city, their clothing is not fashionable enough. However, if you look at it with a different mindset, perhaps this is the simplicity of our people.

### Jinhua Ham Strives for Revival and Seeks Development

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper Jiang Feng

[Reported from Jinhua on the 14th by This Newspaper] When mentioning Jinhua, everyone will think of ham. Indeed, Jinhua ham, which is as famous as Xuanwei ham in Yunnan, has a better aroma than other hams. Jinhua ham is not only produced in Jinhua but also in Dongyang, Lanxi, Pujiang, Yiwu, Yongkang, Wuyi, Tangxi, and other counties belonging to the old Jinhua Prefecture, all of which are collectively called "Jinhua ham." The reason why Jinhua ham is famous at home and abroad is that the manufacturing method is appropriate, but the Jinhua pig breed is different from ordinary pigs, which is the main factor. Jinhua pigs have thin skin, thin bones, short limbs, less subcutaneous fat, particularly developed muscles, fine meat fibers, and are not very heavy. They usually grow for ten months and weigh about 130 catties. The characteristics of the shape is a narrow and long back, a curved waist, a pointed mouth, a long neck, and short limbs. The hair color is mostly black on the head and tail, and white on the four feet and waist.

Pig Feeding Methods

Most farmers in Jinhua take pig raising as a side business. The feeding method is similar to the general method, but the feed is better. Usually, the first day after the sow gives birth, feed it with glutinous rice porridge, followed by soy milk, to make its milk abundant. When the piglets can eat feed, feed them rice, rice soup, or wheat porridge, and then gradually give them a mixture of 10% barley and 40% bean and wheat flour porridge. After eight or nine weeks, they can be weaned and raised separately. After weaning, they are fed in the pigsty. The pigsty is padded with rice straw and wheat straw, and attention is paid to changing it at any time to keep it clean and dry. The usual feed is the leftovers from human food, rice washing water, wild vegetables, and barley flour. Two months before slaughter, better feed is given to fatten them, such as barley porridge, carrot porridge, etc., and sometimes mixed with tofu dregs and wine dregs. During the growing period, it is forbidden to let them run around in the pen, and attention is paid to their hygiene.

The salting method of ham is generally believed that the ham is pickled in a kiln vat, and a dog's leg must be placed in each vat for the whole vat of ham to have a good aroma. In fact, this method is only used by farmers for small-scale salting. Large-scale ham making is not like this.

Leg House and Leg Bed

Now, let's talk about the selection of the pickling room and the structure of the leg bed: The prerequisite for building a leg house is to have light but not too dry and not very ventilated. Other important conditions include preventing the intrusion of flies and mice. Therefore, most choose the downstairs room where the ground is humid, and choose a room with neat and square attic bars. 排釘 (Rows of nails) are placed on the attic to prepare for hanging the legs.

The structure of the leg bed is made of wood. The two feet at one end are slightly higher to allow salt water to flow out. The frame is about eight feet long and about three feet wide. It is covered with alternately facing half-split bamboo tubes, with the joints removed to make it smooth. The leg bed is placed in the pickling room, and several pieces are placed according to its size.

Let's talk about the criteria for selecting legs. In terms of weight, before the war, legs of about 20 catties were selected. In recent years, due to the impact of low purchasing power, large hams are not selling well, so fresh legs of about 10 to 12 catties are selected. In terms of quality, white hair and white toes, thick lean meat and thin fat layer, small limbs, thin and strong skin are the best choice.

Pickling Process

After the leg selection is completed, pickling is started. Now, the process is described as follows:

(1) 整腿: Use a knife to trim the leg meat to make it look beautiful, remove the grease film on the fresh leg, and wipe off the leg congestion.

(2) 椒鹽: Sprinkle a finger's thickness of salt on the leg center, and other places can be slightly thinner. Also, wipe a small amount of salt on the skin surface. After that, salt must be sprinkled each time when flipping the leg, but the amount can be slightly reduced. Some do not sprinkle salt at the last time. It is estimated that about one or one and a half taels of salt is required for one catty of fresh legs.

(3) 疊腿: After the first salting, the leg stacking work is started. First, place the legs facing up in the leg bed. After one layer is full, place two bamboo 蔑 (strips) on the legs. These 蔑 (strips) should be placed on the tail ridge bone. In this way, ten layers can be stacked tightly. Those with excellent skills can stack up to fifteen layers.

(4) 糊腿: Three days after stacking the legs, the first leg flipping is done. First, place the legs one by one on an empty bed, sprinkle some salt, and flip the legs onto the empty bed, using the same method as stacking the legs. Usually, the legs are flipped three times, about every four days. However, according to custom, if it rains, the legs must be 　(cleaned), to prevent them from rotting. Under normal conditions, it takes 12 to 15 days from the first salting to the last flipping of the legs. After that, stack them for another half month, and the leg washing work can be done.

(5) 洗腿: Soak the legs in water for seven or eight hours to allow the rotten substances and salt to gradually dissolve, and then clean them.

(6) 製腿: Press the two sides of the leg with both hands until the shape is full, and then hammer the knee. Also, insert the leg claw into the orange hole, which is tied in advance, so that the claw tip is curved. Then, scrape off the greasy oil on the outer skin with a knife, and then print the trademark.

(7) 晒腿: After the trademark is printed, place the legs facing up on the 蔑 (strip) mat to dry. After they are slightly dry, tie the leg claws with ropes and hang them on wooden racks to sun-dry until the leg skin turns red and oil透 (permeates).

(8) 修腿: Before selling, the legs must be trimmed once to make them smooth and flat.

Types of Jinhua Ham

The finished ham can be divided into the following types:

(1) 雪舫: Those pickled from Minor Snow to Major Snow have good quality and are the best among hams.

(2) 直冬: Those pickled in the dead of winter are also called "眞冬."

(3) 醬腿: A layer of soybean paste is applied to the outside during the last salting. It is brushed off when washing the legs. Although the appearance is inferior, the taste is better than ordinary hams. This kind of product is not produced much and is mostly used for self-consumption.

(4) 月腿: Often the front leg is used, and the limb bones are cut off, and the shape is like a团月 (round moon), hence the name.

(5) 竹葉燻腿: Hang the fresh legs on the stove and smoke them for more than a month. Most are not salted, and the taste is sweet and light.

(6) 深山野味: Made with wild boar legs, black hair is often left as a sign, and the taste is fresh and different.

(7) 戌腿: Made with dog legs, the taste is also very good, and it is mostly used by 번 (??).

(8) 風肉: Pickled in the past, but not cut into a round moon shape, the meat is thicker, and the taste is inferior.

Leg making is a sideline for farmers in the old Jinhua Prefecture counties. In recent decades, due to the oversupply, it has gradually transitioned to centralized production, becoming a workshop form. Each workshop employs a technician who can make more than a thousand hams each year. If a helper is hired in addition to the technician, about three thousand hams can be pickled. Technicians are paid very well, with a monthly salary of 5.6 dan of rice, and some are as high as more than a thousand catties. Ordinary middle and upper-class farmers still produce it as a sideline. Each winter, they make several hams, and the farmers inherit the ancestral methods and pickle them by hand without hiring others to operate.

Total Production Volume

Before the war, the total output of ham in Jinhua counties was more than 800,000 pieces. Among them, Dongyang had the largest output, with an estimated annual output of about 300,000 pieces. Second is Lanxi, with an annual output of 200,000 pieces. Yiwu and Jinhua rank third, with an annual output of about 150,000 pieces each. Yongkang and Pujiang each have about 30,000 to 40,000 pieces. Wuyi and Tangxi also have a combined annual output of more than 10,000 pieces. The annual output of each county varies, depending entirely on market supply and demand. The above-mentioned hams, except for some that are directly transported to Shanghai and Hangzhou by leg merchants, are mostly collected and distributed in Jinhua.

During the Anti-Japanese War, due to various reasons such as raw materials, capital, and sales channels, the production of Jinhua ham once declined sharply to almost no production. Especially after the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Incident in 1942, the entire production area fell into the hands of the Japanese. The enemy often looted everywhere, and few people were willing to raise pigs. Raw materials became a problem, and coupled with the lack of industrial security and the despair of foreign sales, Jinhua ham almost disappeared.

Last Year's Production Volume

After the victory, ham production was expected to recover quickly. However, since the counties of Jinhua had been in enemy hands for three years, the vitality of the rural areas had not recovered, and the production of ham was still sluggish, only reaching one-third of the pre-war level. Last year, it seemed to be gradually recovering, with signs of prosperity, but compared with before the war, it was still far behind. According to insiders, Dongyang still ranked first in production last year, with about 150,000 pieces. Jinhua 　登 ranked second, with only about 100,000 pieces. Lanxi and Yiwu each had about 60,000 to 70,000 pieces, Yongkang had 30,000 pieces, and Pujiang and Wuyi had about 20,000 pieces. The approximate number was only more than 400,000 pieces, which was slightly more than half of the pre-war level.

Road to Revival

Although Jinhua ham has gradually resumed its revival and regrouped, due to the depletion of the rural economy, the depletion of capital in the leg industry, and the inability to restore the pre-war level of production, it seems that it wants to rise but lacks strength. However, ham has suddenly become one of the precious specialties of eastern Zhejiang and should have a promising future. In addition to reporting, I sincerely feel that the Jinhua leg industry needs to be revitalized urgently, and I hope that the government should pay attention to the following points:

(1) Establish a pig breeding farm in Jinhua to breed excellent pig breeds to increase the source of raw materials.

(2) Encourage farmers to raise pigs universally.

(3) Establish a commodity inspection system and standardize the quality of production areas to compete for overseas markets and enrich the rural economy.

(4) Guide farmers to improve ham production technology.

### Hunan-Guangxi-Guizhou Railway Powerhouse: Heshan Coal Mine Faces Difficulties

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper Liang Yushan

[Airmail Report from Guilin on the 14th by This Newspaper] Due to the impact of the situation, the task of the Hunan-Guangxi-Guizhou Railway, which connects the southwest, is becoming more and more onerous, and the problems that need to be solved are becoming more and more urgent. Today, the power problem of the railway is obviously more important than anything else. At present, the railway needs more than 13,000 tons of coal per month, mainly from Heshan, Qiyang, Dapu, and other places. The quality of the coal is very poor except for that produced in Heshan, which contains half sand and soil. In the past, the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway could not climb the high slopes above Liujia without Heshan coal.

The Heshan Coal Mine is located in Qianjiang County, Guangxi Province, with the Heshan and Heli mines. The quality of Heli's products is not pure and cannot be used as machine fuel. The Heshan mine has been mined for more than ten years and is about to be exhausted, from a daily output of 130 tons to a daily output of 70 tons. In May last year, Heshan Coal Mining Company discovered the Dong Mine coalfield in Niulan, eight miles east of the original mine. The reserves are about 500,000 tons. At a daily output of 150 tons of coal, it can be mined for ten years. After this new power was discovered, the mine began construction, but due to limited financial resources, the mining project only opened eight level lanes, and the daily output of coal was only 30 tons, which was far from the original plan. After the products are produced, the transportation problem also follows. To transport the coal energy out continuously, a five-kilometer-long light railway branch line must be built before the rainy season this year. This project alone is enough to make the mine difficult. A five-kilometer light railway with 35-pound rails has more than 100,000 cubic meters of earth and stone, and more than 20 large and small culverts. In addition to materials, the wages alone require more than 2 million catties of rice. If the light rail can be built on schedule, the nearly 2,000 production and transportation workers at the mine railway will also have to eat every day. At a time when production is extremely difficult and coal prices cannot keep up with prices, it is really not easy to cope with such a large scene. At present, the mine is facing these many difficulties. The funds for building the convenience road cannot be borrowed, and the production of coal mines is therefore suffocated. The power fuel for the Hunan-Guangxi-Guizhou Railway will also be blocked. The mine is now calling out loudly, requesting the government to assist.

A Storm in the Guilin Provincial and Municipal Circles

[Reported from Guilin on the 11th by This Newspaper] A small storm has recently arisen in the long-quiet provincial and municipal circles. Recently, the Guilin Municipal Council had opinions with the Municipal Bank and the Police Bureau, which has to be said to be a pity in the unity attack center. On the 7th of this month, the Municipal Council held the 12th session of the Standing Committee. The first two days were to listen to the Municipal Government's policy report, and on the 10th, the Municipal Bank and the Police Bureau were invited to attend the General Assembly for consultation. At that time, both units refused to attend, causing dissatisfaction among all the councilors, and six people, including the speaker and councilors, were sent to the provincial government and the provincial security department to file a joint complaint, while postponing the meeting to await orders.

The police bureau's view is simple, and the attitude is mitigated afterward. The reason given is that the police bureau is a provincial-level agency and has no precedent for attending county and city meetings to report. If it is necessary to consult on municipal security, please send a letter to inquire at any time. Finally, it was expressed that it was willing to wait for the approval of the provincial government and the provincial security department.

The Municipal Bank's attitude is tough, and it goes to extremes with the council, presenting many reasons for refusing to attend. It said that the Municipal Bank is a special limited company jointly run by the government and merchants. All business operations are carried out by a manager who is responsible to the shareholders' meeting or the board of directors in accordance with the regulations. If the council wants to inquire about the bank's business, it needs to talk to the bank. The manager of the bank, Chen Shouyun, firmly stated that he would never accept the council's opinions. Even if the superior agency instructed, he said: "The mayor is the chairman of the municipal bank and the speaker is the standing supervisor. The bank acts as the municipal treasury and other businesses. The council members can directly go to the bank to inquire. It is not discrimination against the council, but there is no need to attend the report." He finally reiterated that if the council insisted on making things difficult for him, he would at most leave. The council is still continuing to postpone the meeting, and this deadlock seems to be awaiting Chairman Huang to resolve it.
