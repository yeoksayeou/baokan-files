### Close Coordination of Land, Sea, and Air Forces in Combat: National Army Achieves Victory at Gaoqiao, Pudong; Communist Troops Suffer Heavy Losses and Offensive is Contained

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Military sources at 10:50 AM on the 21st: Yesterday, the bandit forces, with a force of four elite armies, attacked our Gaoqiao position in Pudong. Our army, navy, and air force soldiers and officers launched a fierce joint attack, engaging in hand-to-hand combat, exerting their maximum power. The bandits suffered casualties of over 12,500, with corpses littering the field. Over 150 light and heavy machine guns were seized, and over 1,500 prisoners were captured. The bandit forces' formation was extremely chaotic, and their offensive gradually subsided. Fierce fighting is still ongoing.

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Military news: Yesterday (21st), a large number of bandit troops were discovered near Gaoqiao, attempting to make trouble. Our front-line command immediately contacted the air force. Due to poor weather in the early morning, a large number of aircraft groups were not dispatched. In the afternoon, the weather cleared, and our air force dispatched a large formation of aircraft groups from a certain base, flying over Gaoqiao to bomb in shifts. At the same time, our navy coordinated with infantry and artillery, launching a three-pronged attack on the bandits. The bandits suffered heavy losses, and the bodies of the dead were stacked like pillows. Detailed battle results are still being investigated.

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] According to the Air Force Headquarters, after the Communist army's attack on the Wusong District was frustrated, they gathered the 20th, 21st, 25th, 30th, 31st, and 5th Armies in the Pudong District. Last night, they launched a fierce offensive against our Gaoqiao-Gaohang line in Pudong, attempting to capture Gaoqiao and then cross the Huangpu River to attack our Wusong fortress area from the rear. Our military authorities were aware of the Communist army's intentions and made careful preparations. This morning (21st), as soon as the Communist army's offensive began, it was met with a brave counterattack by our army, navy, and air force. This morning (21st), although the area around the city was covered with low, dense clouds, less than 400 feet high, a unit of the air force still bravely took off. From 11:00 AM, as the weather improved, a large number of aircraft were deployed, attacking the Communist army in shifts at ten-minute intervals. Within a few hours, nearly one hundred aircraft were dispatched. Furthermore, due to the close and accurate coordination of the land-air liaison radio, bombing and strafing were all on target. The Communist army's offensive was immediately contained by us. The Communist army's losses in this battle are believed to be very heavy. As of 8:00 PM, our army had generally advanced one thousand meters southeast from Gaoqiao and has already achieved preliminary victory. Our aircraft suffered damage to six aircraft due to anti-aircraft fire from the Communist army during low-altitude bombing. However, each air force soldier became even more emboldened due to the damage to their aircraft and continued to attack during the night.

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] The Songhu Garrison Headquarters issued a battle report at 11:00 AM on the 21st: A bandit force of over 300 in Pudong attempted to infiltrate the Zhonghua Wharf from Langli on the evening of the 20th. Our mobile troops immediately rushed to intercept them. The Zhonghua Wharf is still under our army's control and is as peaceful as usual.

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] The Songhu Garrison Headquarters issued a battle report at 7:00 AM on the 21st: (1) On the Yuepu-Yanghang line, the bandits on the front have been severely annihilated for days and are in disarray, with no ability to attack again.

(2) The bandits in Liujiahang International Radio Station and other places frequently attacked us yesterday (20th), especially on the International Radio Station line, where the fighting was the fiercest. A certain unit of our loyal and brave officers and soldiers calmly responded to the battle, repelling the invading bandits. The bandits' corpses were piled up, and blood formed ditches.

### Acting President Li Publishes a Message, Clarifying the Government's Purpose in Engaging in War, Hoping for National Unity and Cooperation to Achieve the Task of Self-Salvation and National Salvation

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 20th] Acting President Li published a message to the compatriots of the whole country on the 20th. The full text is as follows:

Compatriots across the country! Four months ago, the government, unwilling to allow the country and people to continue suffering the horrors of war, followed the unanimous desire of the people of the whole country for peace and decided to advocate peace. Zongren also repeatedly expressed his willingness to use the highest sincerity, personally sacrificing everything, in order to achieve peace. Unexpectedly, all these sincere expressions and painstaking efforts to compromise have come to naught. Because the Chinese Communists have never given up their attempt to conquer the whole country by force, they put forward a so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement" that was extremely harsh and unacceptable to the government. At the same time, when the government replied asking them to reconsider, they disregarded it and ordered a general offensive, forcibly crossing the Yangtze River. As a result, the peace talks that the compatriots of the whole country eagerly hoped for could not continue and finally broke down, and the flames of war spread and expanded again. Who is responsible for this breakdown of peace talks and the continuation of the war, who is not sincere in seeking peace, and who has made the people suffer the misery of war again? All of this, the whole country and even the world, can make a fair judgment based on ironclad facts. I will not explain more here. But there is one point that I want the compatriots of the whole country to clearly understand, that is, the Chinese Communist Party, due to its international background and its basic spirit, must use violence to eliminate all non-Communist forces, must use violence to rule all the people of China, and must destroy China's excellent traditional culture and morality for thousands of years. They are not only without pity, driving all the people of China to sacrifice in today's civil war, but also in future international wars, they will make our country and people loyal to the Communist International and die for it. The so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement" they put forward this time is full of this spirit and fully exposes their conspiracy and poisonous plan, which also explains the content of their so-called "liberation" work. Compatriots! I ask you, do we need such "liberation"? Should we take our lives and country to sacrifice for another international group and follow them down the road to destruction? If not, we must resist this violent oppression, because we want to survive, we want freedom, we want democracy, and we want to protect our country's independence. The government is fighting today based on this purpose, and compatriots across the country should understand this meaning and make the greatest effort to cooperate with the government to achieve the task of self-salvation and national salvation.

Everyone knows that war is the most cruel. After more than ten years of continuous internal and external wars, the people are impoverished and the country is devastated. The government cannot bear to engage in war unless it is absolutely necessary. I personally have also believed in the past that the dispute between brothers should be resolved politically, and there is no reason to resort to arms. This is my basic concept of advocating peace. But the Chinese Communists not only have no sincerity for peace, but also want not only the government to surrender to them, but also the people of the whole country to surrender to them, and want all the people of China to be placed under the violent rule of the Chinese Communists. The facts shown today in the so-called "liberated areas" are enough to prove their cruelty and hypocrisy. Some people and young people in the "liberated areas" have fled to government areas. Some poor peasants and workers have been forced to become cannon fodder under their so-called "joining the army" and "offering grain" calls and have been squeezed dry. Some young people have no books to read, and some of the "democratic people" they advocate have become ornaments under strict surveillance. In short, the people in the "liberated areas" today not only have no freedom in life, but also suffer great oppression and terror in their thoughts and spirit all the time. Furthermore, in the peace talks this time, the Chinese Communists deliberately put forward the most harsh conditions and immediately began to cross the river without considering our reply, fearing that there would still be room for mediation and that their conspiracy would not succeed. These facts show that the Chinese Communists are determined to cruelly conquer the people to complete their attempt to conquer all of China by force and rule all of China by violence. Therefore, today I want to tell the compatriots of the whole country that I stand in the position of the government and with my sense of responsibility to the country and people. I cannot sacrifice the sovereign right of national independence in our hands. I cannot bury the right of the compatriots of the whole country to live freely. Therefore, I know that the continuation of the war will increase the suffering of the people, but in order to resist this violent oppression and destruction, I must painfully end the war with war. I hope that the compatriots of the whole country will further understand that if we cannot endure the current pain and work together to resist the violence of the Chinese Communists, the pain we will suffer in life and spirit in the future will be a thousand times greater than today. Everything that the compatriots in the so-called "liberated areas" are suffering is a good example.

Secondly, the Chinese Communists have publicly sworn that they will fight side by side with the Soviet Union in the next world war. This is tantamount to the Chinese Communists having already signed a pre-sale contract to sacrifice the lives and property of our compatriots across the country for others before the outbreak of the Third World War. This is what every person with a national and national concept cannot tolerate. In the past, the government accepted material assistance from the United States. The Chinese Communists have repeatedly accused us of being a traitorous government. Compatriots, everyone thinks about it, who is willing to sell the country? If accepting American aid is selling the country, then which country did not accept American aid in the Second World War? Wouldn't they all become traitorous governments? After the war, the Soviet Union and other countries also asked the United States for assistance. Why did the Chinese Communists not accuse the Soviet Union of being a traitorous country? Why did the people of other countries not accuse their own governments of being traitorous countries? Compatriots! Let us think again, is it selling the country to accept American aid that treats me equally, or is it sacrificing our country's independence and autonomy to accept the leadership of the Communist International and make our country and people loyal to the Communist International and die for it? We must know that the Chinese Communist Party today takes another country as their motherland and uses the national flag of another country as the national flag of China. Therefore, they say with madness that they will fight side by side with the Soviet Union. This is what all people with a national and national concept cannot bear to hear. Compatriots! We must also know that the reason why the Chinese Communists oppose American aid is to deliberately deepen the poverty of the Chinese people and develop the power of communism in the poverty and hunger of the whole of China, so they do not hesitate to sacrifice our country and people to achieve their so-called world revolution. Fellow compatriots! I ask you, do we need such a revolution? If this revolution succeeds, perhaps half of the lives of the Chinese people will be sacrificed, and the country of China will be completely reduced to an appendage of another country. The continued development of this violent force will inevitably threaten Southeast Asia and even the whole world. Therefore, in order to protect national independence, the survival of the people, and world peace, we must fight to resist the violence of the Chinese Communists.

In short, compatriots! We should be clear that today this war is definitely not for the government, but for the people, for the country, and not for the interests of a few, but for the struggle for survival and freedom of the people of the whole country, not for a certain party or faction, but for the struggle for national independence. The government's military situation is undoubtedly quite bad, but I think that if our compatriots across the country can have a correct understanding and distinction of reality and the future, good and bad, and clearly understand the conspiracy of the Chinese Communists to harm the country and people, then the reversal of the military situation and all the difficulties and hardships need not be worried too much. Because in history, only justice can defeat force, and those who believe in force will eventually fail. Here, I can responsibly tell the compatriots of the whole country that from today onwards, the government I lead has a firm determination to resist this violent oppression. Even to the last soldier, we will never give up our responsibility. At the same time, we must eliminate any obstacles and carry out reforms in politics, economy, and military affairs, and ensure that all government measures can adapt to the needs of the times and the demands of the people, in order to rigorously organize the government's line-up and strengthen the government's power to engage in the anti-communist war to protect the interests of the country and people. I sincerely hope that our compatriots across the country can recognize the meaning and purpose of this war. For the sake of self-salvation and national salvation, we must voluntarily and actively do our best to assist the government and work together in this war against violence, anti-deception, anti-totalitarianism, anti-terrorism, and anti-aggression. With the support of the broad masses, I believe that we will inevitably achieve final victory. Long live the Republic of China.

He asked to be transferred to the front line to serve, and then asked to be transferred back after the victory in Greater Shanghai.

### Salary Payment Method for Civil and Military Personnel this Month: Shanghai Calculates According to the Local Customs Gold Unit Exchange Rate

It was resolved that the payment of salaries and allowances to public servants and teachers in May would be calculated at a rate of one Customs Gold Unit to six Hong Kong dollars in Guangzhou, and according to the local Customs Gold Unit exchange rate in Shanghai. Areas outside Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Huanghai would be divided into three zones according to the method used in April, and it was stipulated that each Customs Gold Unit would be calculated as 1.8 million Gold Yuan in the first zone, 1.4 million Gold Yuan in the second zone, and 1 million Gold Yuan in the third zone to issue Gold Yuan coupons. Military personnel would all be handled according to the standards of the second zone.

### Main Force Lost, Publicly Abandoned, and Relatives Separated: Wu Huawen Detained by His Subordinates in Pudong

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Reliable military news, Wu Huawen was willing to sell himself to the Communist bandits after leading his troops to defect in the Jinan campaign. During this time when bandits crossed the river, Wu was driven to the front as a vanguard, serving as cannon fodder in every human wave tactic. His troops were always under the surveillance and control of the Communist bandits, and were forced to participate in combat. After crossing the river, they were transferred to the suburbs of Shanghai and roamed around in the Pudong area. After days of joint suppression and bombing by the national army's land and air forces, the main force was almost completely lost, and the remnants had no fighting spirit. Wu still had to carry out the Communist Party's orders, driving his troops to their deaths. According to a Communist prisoner's confession, Wu was bought by the Communist army with a certain amount of gold bars when he defected in central Shandong. His important aides on the left and right expressed dissatisfaction and often complained. Recently, Wu was detained by them in a certain place in Pudong, and he was ordered to hand over the Communist Party's gold bars.

### Commander-in-Chief Gui Inspects the Battle on the Flagship: Machine Guns Heavily Fire on Enemy Positions; Heavy Smoke Covers the Jiang'an Bank Outside Wusongkou East Depot

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] A certain unit of the Navy's First Fleet yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM shelled the Communist army attacking Gaoqiao from the waters of Dongku, Yangjiazha, and Tianzhutang outside Wusongkou, achieving remarkable results. According to reports from ground troops, more than a thousand Communist soldiers in the Dongku, Yangjiazha, and Tianzhutang areas defected to the national army due to the intense shelling by naval warships. There were more than 500 casualties. The navy cooperated with ground troops in combat for three hours yesterday afternoon. Navy Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing, First Fleet Commander Ma Jizhuang, and Captain Liu Guangkai took the flagship to the front line to command. Commander-in-Chief Gui ordered the flagship he was on to sail close to the Communist army's position in Pudong at a distance of 2,000 meters, using the 40mm machine guns that the Communist army feared most to fire intensively. The reporter saw through binoculars that more than a dozen Communist strongholds were destroyed and caught fire. At that time, in addition to the ground troops engaging in positional warfare with the Communist army, the air force dispatched three bombers to indicate naval firing targets and carried out bombing and strafing. Heavy smoke covered the Jiang'an bank outside Dongku. Many national army soldiers relied on the back-to-water fortifications to block the Communist army's various activities. Fishermen on Chongming Island fishing with nets, as well as farmhouses and fishing families and pedestrians in fields more than ten miles away from the front line, could be seen from the flagship. Gui and Commander Ma and other senior naval generals commanded other warships to fight by radio on the flagship. The gunners on the ship were calm, careful, and meticulous. Gui told reporters that the fighting will of the naval soldiers and officers is extremely strong. After the retreat from Nanjing, the navy has formed a strong and seamless fortress. He believes that with the victory of the Pudong offensive, Shanghai can be stabilized for at least three months. General Gui believes that the bandit army actually has many difficulties. He believes that we should put will first. A strong will combined with artillery will definitely achieve victory.

### Editorial: Calm First, Order First

As the flames of war draw closer to Shanghai, the streets become even more filled with wartime scenes. The most obvious are the panic of the people and the eastward and westward movements of refugees. Not only are people from the suburbs moving to the city, but people in the city are also moving to the safe areas they envision, with everyone believing that another place is ultimately safer than their own. This is the existence of illusion, which not only increases the psychological panic of the citizens but also increases their material losses. Standing from the perspective of public opinion, we must shout the slogan "Calm First" to the six million citizens of the city. This state of being restless all day long only increases the danger to society. Frankly speaking, in today's Shanghai, fate is shared, and there is no distinction between the southeast, northwest, east, or west. Anyway, everything is the same. What is the difference between fifty steps and a hundred steps in the end!

Logically, obtaining safety and avoiding danger are basic needs of life. Thinking carefully about it, this need is actually more urgent than eating. The purpose of eating is to maintain life, but once safety is ignored, danger approaches, and life is lost in an instant, what is the use of just talking about eating? Safety is directly related to life. The "Safety First" advocated by Westerners is truly worthy of contemplation.

As the world changes, the essence of the safety issue also changes. Many dangers in the past, such as floods and fierce beasts drowning and eating people, have now become relics. On the other hand, the modern era of culture and machines has brought a brand new and more serious danger. Life has become more stressful, cities have become more crowded, and both people and things have become more mobile, thus creating dangers that did not exist before. Car accidents are the most prominent example. In the United States, the total number of people who die under the wheels of cars every year is twenty to thirty thousand. According to statistical reports, the year with the fewest deaths recently was 1923, but even then, 18,400 people were killed. In 1941, it was 39,969, and in 1949, it was 28,076. Among the deaths, young people aged fifteen to twenty-four accounted for 52%. In World War I, the United States lost 300,000 soldiers, while 325,000 were crushed to death by cars at the same time, almost one person dying every eighteen minutes! In the United States, the total number of accidental injuries and deaths per year is about 100,000. In the past twelve years, more than one million people have died, 25 million have been seriously injured, and the loss is at least 400,000,000 gold dollars.

In today's civilized countries, the leading cause of death is not disease but accidental injuries. In the United States, between the ages of three and thirty-eight for males and three to twenty-one for females, death from accidental injuries is more common than any disease or epidemic. This is the case in peacetime, and even more so in wartime. With artillery fire raging in the suburbs of Shanghai, the danger is truly unimaginable for people with outdated minds surrounded by new weapons in a small battlefield. On the 16th, when a group of air force planes flew over the city on their way to the front lines, one plane suddenly lost control and dropped a bomb due to the vibration on Tangshan Road. On the 18th, when the Zhongxing ship was departing for Taiwan, the order at the pier was chaotic. Some people boarded the ship without buying tickets, and some bought black market tickets near the ship temporarily but could not get on. Later, the gangway was removed, and people were hoisted up from the ship with ropes. How great is the danger in this situation! These past few days, citizens fleeing from Pudong and the suburbs have been passing through rivers and streams late at night, pushing and trampling each other, and the crowds are unbearable, making it possible to cause death everywhere. There is always the danger of escaping for one's life but losing it.

Citizens of Shanghai have been sitting in a powder keg recently, and their psychology is inevitably abnormal. They are startled by the slightest sound and see enemies everywhere. In their imaginations, they will also create something out of nothing. Their nerves are tense, and they react greatly to the slightest stimulus. When rumors start, they believe them to be true without asking questions. The day before yesterday, a slight sound of gunfire was heard at the Sixteenth Wharf, and people thought something was wrong. Stores closed one after another, and pedestrians and rickshaw pullers scattered in panic, running away with all their might. The road was in complete chaos. The pedestrians were running away while asking people what was going on. But no one could answer what was going on. However, everyone blindly followed others and ran away in a mess. The entire Nanshi fell into a commotion. It turned out that nothing had happened. It was just that the guarding troops in the Huangpu River fired their guns to prohibit ships from approaching the shore. This situation is like "one dog barks at a shadow, and a hundred dogs bark in response." There is nothing wrong in the world, but mediocre people trouble themselves. However, the danger lies hidden in this chaotic scene.

I remember during the "August 13th" incident, on the evening of November 7th, there was a rumor that Pudong had fallen, and people rushed to cross the river at night, and countless people drowned. On November 9th, Fenglin Bridge was lost, and corpses piled up along the Binjiang. Many children with faces stained with dark blood sucked on their mothers' stiff nipples and fell on the shore. Before the war, wasn't the Shanghai concession a safe haven? But the Public Concession had such an shocking report: "From August 13th to October 12th, in these two months, 2,057 non-combatants (i.e., citizens) and 36 foreigners died from stray bullets in the Shanghai Public Concession. This number of deaths is 33 times more than the 71 deaths and 116 injuries during the "January 28th" incident. Casualties not reported to the patrol room are not included in this example." Remember the past, and you will be a teacher for the future.

In short, in this time of war and danger, only by maintaining calm and responding to all changes with an unchanging spirit can we turn danger into safety. We appeal to the six million citizens of Shanghai with this, and at the same time, we hope that the police authorities can take "maintaining order" as their sacred duty and maintain the order of Shanghai with all their strength.

### Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to Open Tomorrow; Acheson Arrives in Paris; Confers with Bevin and Schuman at French Foreign Ministry on Common Position; Vyshinsky's Entourage Departs Moscow

[Report from this Newspaper] Paris, 21st - A broadcast from Paris states that US Secretary of State Acheson, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and French Foreign Minister Schuman met at the French Foreign Ministry today for about 15 minutes to discuss adopting a common position to attend the Four-Power Conference. Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky left Moscow for Paris today.

[United Press, Paris, 21st] US Secretary of State Acheson, aboard the presidential plane "Independence," arrived at Orly Airport here at 9:03 this morning to attend the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, which opens on the 23rd.

[Reuters, Paris, 20th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin arrived here from London today. He will approve, together with Acheson and Schuman, the common policy of the three powers in the Foreign Ministers' Conference, which was secretly drafted by the three countries' diplomatic experts this week, before the opening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Well-informed sources said that the opinions of the Western three powers have now almost converged, and it is expected that Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky will face the unanimous position of the three powers on the following points: (1) Not to allow the Soviet Union to participate in the control of the Ruhr; (2) To maintain West Germany; (3) Never to give up aid to Germany. The Soviet Embassy here does not yet know when Vyshinsky will arrive. Reports from Moscow say that Vyshinsky is accompanied by as many as 70 people, including German experts, political advisors, and secretaries.

[United Press, Paris, 20th] Diplomatic sources said today that Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky will likely reveal a recent change in the Soviet leadership at the beginning of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. Whether this indicates a major change in Soviet policy remains to be seen. With Vyshinsky succeeding Molotov as Foreign Minister after the recent major changes in the Soviet leadership, it is expected that his remarks after the opening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference here on Monday will provide clues to the significance of the Soviet leadership change. Western allies believe that if there is any change in Soviet policy, it will turn for the better, so Western diplomats will observe signs of the Soviet Union wanting to end its obstructionist tactics. In the past 24 hours, the Soviet Union has issued two important announcements, apparently in preparation for the Foreign Ministers' Conference: (1) After the US and Britain suggested to the Soviet delegation at the UN General Assembly in New York to resolve the Greek civil war, Soviet representative Gromyko suggested a possible solution. (2) The Soviet Union intends to repatriate all remaining Japanese prisoners of war to Japan. It is generally believed that these two announcements by the Soviet Union are actions in the Soviet peace offensive. These two issues are unlikely to be submitted for discussion at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, as the purpose of this conference is to specifically discuss the German issue, but there may be informal talks on the Greek situation. Deputy representatives of the UK, US, and France have drafted a comprehensive plan on the German issue to deal with Vyshinsky. According to various sources, the success of the Foreign Ministers' Conference depends solely on the Soviet Union.

### Austrian Foreign Minister Warns Four Powers: Occupation Must End; Austrian Peace Treaty Cannot Be Delayed

[Reuters, Vienna, 21st] Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber said in a speech to the Austrian People's Party Congress yesterday that if the Four Powers cannot resolve the Austrian issue at this Foreign Ministers' Conference, Austria will refuse to pay any occupation fees if necessary. Austria will also declare that the Austrian issue is no longer a topic for international conferences to discuss, and then immediately begin to organize a federal army to end the occupation.

He emphasized that we must tell the powers that the current state of occupation, disguised as liberation, must end. We must also show the powers that the Austrian people's patience has run out. In the future, the Austrian people will adopt a more active policy, with Austria's own interests taking precedence over the demands and orders of the Allied governments. If the Four Powers refuse to discuss the Austrian issue at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference and refuse to recognize Austria's right to build an army and demand an end to the occupation, Austria will accuse the power that refuses of aggressive actions against Austria in the United Nations.

### Pravda Commentary

Success or Failure of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference Depends on the Attitude of the West

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 20th] "Pravda" published today, criticizing the attitude of the UK, US, and France as the reason why an agreement on the German issue could not be reached. It continued, saying that the division of Germany has led to the division of Europe. But the Western countries' policy of division, their refusal to cooperate with the Soviet Union, and their abandonment of the plans obtained in Potsdam have promoted the development of a worldwide movement in favor of peace and against war. The agreement of the four countries has allowed the Foreign Ministers' Conference to be reopened and to discuss the basic German issues again, but the success or failure of this discussion will depend on the position taken by the Western countries.

### Railway Workers in West Berlin Stage a Strike

Demand Wages Paid in West German Marks

[Associated Press, Berlin, 21st] Twelve thousand railway workers in West Berlin began a strike at noon yesterday in opposition to the Soviet-controlled Railway Administration, and railway transport lines in West Berlin were also blocked as a result. The Railway Administration sent armed forces to interfere with the strike, and clashes occurred with anti-communist striking workers. A row of elevated railway passenger cars was burned down in the melee. The West Berlin government announced that West German police will suppress further interference with the strike by communists in the Soviet zone. It is heard that some communists have expressed sympathy for the strikers, believing that the workers' demand for wages to be paid in West German marks (worth four times more than East German marks) is quite reasonable. At the same time, the Railway Administration has ordered West German freight cars to unload goods in Potsdam and then transfer them to Berlin by truck. Soviet freight cars are also unloading and transferring goods outside the city of Berlin.

### Four-Power Negotiations on German Economic Cooperation Proceed Smoothly

[Associated Press, Berlin, 20th] Four-power negotiations on German economic cooperation were smoother today than in previous days. The meeting was held at the Soviet headquarters in Karlshorst. According to a British spokesman, the meeting has made headway in reorganizing trade between East and West Germany.

### The Only Condition for Ending the Greek Civil War: The Rebels Must Lay Down Their Arms; Official Attitude Towards Soviet Proposal is Cold

[Associated Press, Athens, 20th] The Greek Cabinet held a special cabinet meeting today to discuss the Soviet proposal for ending the civil war, but both official and non-official sources expressed a cold attitude.

[Reuters, Athens, 20th] Greek News Agency reported: Greek Minister of Public Security Rentis said today that if Greece is to obtain peace, all powers, including the Soviet Union, must recognize that the Greek Communist Party must never participate in the political life of Greece.

The powers should understand the goal of the Greek guerrilla leaders, which is to understand Greece, and their unrestricted activities are no longer possible. According to informal sources, the Greek government's policy towards the guerrillas is as follows: (1) The guerrillas must surrender unconditionally; (2) The government is prepared to pardon communists who can "repent and reform"; (3) The Greek Communist Party cannot be recognized or participate in any elections; (4) The Greek government may consider the participation of non-communist left-wing elements in politics. British Ambassador Norton and Charge d'Affaires McNair visited Foreign Minister Tsaldaris tonight to inform him of the Soviet proposal for the three powers to negotiate an end to the Greek civil war.

The Course of Negotiations between the US, UK, and France

[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] After lifting the Berlin blockade, the Soviet Union again proposed to the UK and US to end the three-year Greek civil war. According to TASS news, the Soviet Union has proposed a conditional solution to the Greek civil war to the US and UK. London and Washington immediately released information on informal contacts. According to the State Department, these informal contacts began at a banquet at the home of UN Secretary-General Lie in New York on the 26th of last month. On the 4th of this month, US Deputy Secretary of State Rusk and British Undersecretary McNeil were invited by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko to meet and talk, and they continued to talk at the UN General Assembly last Saturday.

The Soviet Union Proposed a Solution

Gromyko put forward several conditions: (1) All countries should stop all military aid to Greece. (2) The relevant countries should supervise the re-election in Greece, and the Soviet Union is willing to participate in the supervision. (3) The relevant countries should organize a monitoring group to manage the northern border of Greece. Gromyko also conveyed the conditions put forward by the guerrillas: (1) Order a ceasefire; (2) Implement a general amnesty; (3) Re-election. Rusk replied to Gromyko at the time that the crux of the problem was the illegal assistance provided by Greece's neighboring countries to the rebels, and that the United Nations organization was the formal place to discuss this issue. According to the British Foreign Office, McNeil also told Gromyko that if Greece's northern neighbors stopped aiding the Greek rebels, the war could be stopped. After several talks, Gromyko immediately returned to Moscow to ask for instructions from the government.

The US Respects Athens' Opinion

[Reuters, London, 20th] The UK and US today officially notified the Soviet Union that they do not intend to begin negotiations to end the Greek civil war without fully exchanging views with the Athens authorities. At the same time, the US State Department has stated to the Soviet Union that the US will continue to assist the Greek government in defending itself against aggression. Because the US believes that the discussion of the Greek issue must fully solicit the opinions of the Greek government, the US cannot agree to discuss the Greek issue at the next Foreign Ministers' Conference.

### Archbishop of Athens Passes Away

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 20th] Archbishop of Athens and Greek Orthodox Pope Damaskinos passed away due to a heart attack at his suburban residence today. The Archbishop served as the Governor of Greece after the Greek Revolution in 1944.

### Tito's Speech Condemns the Soviet Union

Hopes to Correct Past Mistakes

[Reuters, Belgrade, 20th] Marshal Tito said in a speech to his Communist Party Guard Division here today, referring to the relationship between Yugoslavia and the Eastern Bloc, that the Soviet Union should be responsible for the current tension. The Soviet Union should know that it has made mistakes and should try to correct them. Tito also said that our position is not bad, and our goal is to establish socialism.

### The US Does Not Intend to Consider a Pacific Treaty at Present

[Associated Press, New York, 20th] "The New York Times" said in an editorial today that Secretary of State Acheson has made it clear that the government does not intend to consider concluding a Pacific treaty along the lines of the Atlantic Treaty at present. It is true that the political nature of the Pacific region is different. If a Pacific treaty cannot be concluded, other measures and steps should also be planned and taken to uphold the position of the United States. Our avoidance and prevention of any attempt to establish a Pacific treaty should not hinder our consistent advocacy of resisting communist expansion.

### The World's Largest Exposition Opens in Paris

### Three-Power Football Enthusiastically Performed; Tung Wah Wins 2-1 Against Railway

[Report from this Newspaper] The third act of the Tung Wah vs. Railway Three-Power Football Invitational Tournament was held at Yiyuan at 3:00 PM yesterday. Nearly 10,000 fans attended, a grand occasion rarely seen in the football season. Railway is the champion of this year's Mayor's Cup, and Tung Wah is a well-known veteran team. As expected, they showed their prowess and defeated Railway by 2 to 1 after 90 minutes of intense battle. The performance was quite wonderful, especially in the first half. Tung Wah scored two goals in a row, taking the lead with a score of 2-0. In the second half, Railway was awarded a penalty kick. Zhang Lingen committed a foul, and Xiao Ziwen scored, breaking the egg for Railway with a score of 2-1. Tung Wah's victory was due to its solid defense. Wu Qixiang, Zhang Lingen, and Han Nibo, the three musketeers, made the Railway forwards inflexible and unable to play their role. Fortunately, Gao Baozheng firmly defended the center and blocked Tung Wah's offensive. In the second half, Tung Wah's stamina was insufficient, and Railway's counterattack was fierce, but they did not achieve their wish. The whole match was a quite intense and wonderful performance.

When the time came, Railway ordered an attack but withdrew midway. Tung Wah pressed forward with all its strength, and the Railway hinterland was in danger. Tung Wah's generals attacked endlessly. Chen Mingzhe started an uprising on the frontier and kicked a ball in the middle. Liao Xiong jumped up to catch it, but Han Longhai crashed into it head-on and failed to score. Qian Yuanqing got the ball and cleverly passed it through the gap. Chen Mingzhe rushed in like a horse freed from its reins and shot. Liao Xiong couldn't defend in time and lost a goal. Tung Wah took the lead with a score of 1-0. After this loss, Railway worked hard to counterattack, but Tung Wah's momentum was even stronger. Chen Mingzhe ignited the flames of war on the border and pointed it towards the center. Han Longhai shot near the goal, but Liao Xiong扑ed it out. Railway moved from silence, Wu Binghao jumped to the left and started an army, Gao Baozheng hooked it in the middle, Lin Dianyi rushed to shoot, hit Zhang Banglun's foot and bounced out. Holding each other until 36 minutes, Li Yao got the ball and circled around a few times, passing Wu Jiabang, and passed it in front of the goal. Han Longhai rushed up and headed it in, and another goal was scored. The first half ended with a score of 2-0. After the break, the two armies fought again, with Railway's original formation unchanged. Tung Wah's main generals Xie Xichuan and Gao Xiuqing arrived and replaced Li Kongjin and Guan Yuanchang. Railway was eager for revenge and fought hard. Zhang Lingen fouled in the penalty area, Xiao Ziwen took the penalty kick, and the ball fell into the net, pulling back a goal. After that, Tung Wah's stamina was insufficient, and Railway pressed hard, relying on Wu Qixiang as a pillar to repel the offensive. Xiao Ziwen pulled hard from 20 yards away, and Zhang Banglun saved it. After that, Lin Dianyi went straight into the camp, a wonderful opportunity, but it did not work. When the silver whistle blew, Tung Wah won by one goal.

### Men's and Women's Basketball, Two Games Today

There will be one men's and one women's basketball friendly match today, starting at 3:45 PM in the gymnasium. Tickets are priced at 5 million yuan downstairs, and 8 million yuan for reserved seating inside. The schedule is as follows:

Ya Team – John (Women's Friendly) 3:45 PM

Hua Lian – Old Rain (Men's and Women's Friendly) 4:45 PM

The Ya Team is a rising force, having won the third place in the Mayor's Cup women's group. Their strength is quite formidable, with famous players such as Wang Shan, Zhu Jiazhen, Wang Zhelun, Qian Mengyue, and Sun Fengzhu in their lineup. Their defense is solid. John is the elite of the school team, brave and skilled, and their abilities are evenly matched with the Ya Team, making a fierce battle inevitable.

Since winning the League A and Mayor's Cup championships consecutively, Hua Lian has been showcasing their skills in friendly matches, and they have been victorious in every game, not encountering any opponents. This shows that their championship style is truly extraordinary. Old Rain combines the elites of Da Gong and Hui Li, and their lineup is well-organized. In addition to Tu Wenlong, Cai Zhongqiang, Zhan [blank space], and Shang Chongyue, they have also gained Cao Zhiji and Tian Fuhai to participate, making them even more powerful. Previously, they faced Ren Yu and the match was undecided, showing their strong fighting ability. At that time, they were evenly matched with Hua Lian, and the battle situation will be very exciting.

### Mayor Concerned About Soaring Rice Prices, Severe Punishment for Those Stirring Up Trouble, Designating Two Wharf Areas for Rice Ships to Dock, Simplifying Oil Allocation Procedures for Public Utility Companies

[Reported by this newspaper] Mayor Chen Liang met with reporters at the City Hall office at 5:00 PM yesterday and reported on the city's commodity prices, rice supply, and oil supply for public utilities as follows:

(1) After a period of stability, commodity prices in the city have suddenly risen sharply again recently, especially food. The rise in vegetable prices is largely influenced by the environment. Due to the approaching war, the transportation of vegetables has become difficult, and the source has been blocked, thus affecting the price surge. As for the soaring rice prices, there are signs that unscrupulous merchants are taking the opportunity to raise prices. The city government has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Department to thoroughly investigate. Commander-in-Chief Tang has also ordered the Garrison Command to effectively suppress the prices. If any unscrupulous merchants are found to be stirring up trouble and harming citizens, they will be immediately arrested and severely punished with the death penalty for disrupting the financial system during the martial law period.

(2) Regarding the rice supply issue, recently, due to the impact of the war, all rice ships transporting rice to Shanghai have been anchored outside the Wusongkou, unable to directly drive to the wharves of the Huangpu River, making it impossible to unload. In addition, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recently had three rice ships, Hai Lie, Hai Tian, and Hong Zhang, fully loaded with 19,000 tons of rice purchased by the US Economic Cooperation Administration and the government from Hong Kong, but they had to return to Hong Kong midway due to the impact of the war. In order to solve the rice supply problem, I personally discussed solutions with Commander-in-Chief Tang, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Shi, and Naval Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing yesterday morning, and it was decided to assign Deputy Chief of Staff Hu Xin and Naval First Fleet Commander Dong Muzeng to jointly be responsible. The Navy was ordered to vacate a military wharf in Wusongkou and designate the Zhanghuabang Wharf exclusively for rice ships to dock. Both wharves are safe areas, and imported rice ships can unload there. If any rice ships are still unwilling to go there, they can report to the city government, and the authorities will send other ships to Wusongkou to unload and transport them to Shanghai, and send the Navy and Army to protect them at the same time, so as to prevent the rice supply in the city from being cut off.

(3) In order to solve the problem of oil supply for public utilities and prevent its interruption, the city government has decided to simplify the oil allocation procedures. According to the original allocation procedures, it was necessary to obtain joint approval from five institutions: the Shanghai Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, the US Aid Utilization Committee, the Central Bank, the Customs, and the City Government. It is now decided that in the future, only the seal and approval of the Shanghai Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration will be required for allocation. The Shanghai Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration will be responsible for settling the prices with the above responsible institutions and notifying the public utility companies to directly pay the Central Bank.

Jewelry for silver dollar exchange, miscellaneous foreign coins initially traded at 45-50. In the afternoon, it also fell to 46-47. Factory bars added another 2 yuan, at 44-49, also a decrease of 3 yuan.

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the market for nickel coins continued to rise. Due to the brisk gold-cash market and strong public confidence, street vendors only bought and did not sell. In the morning, 20-fen coins traded at 1 million-1.5 million, and in the afternoon, they rose to 2 million-2.5 million. Ten-fen coins rose to 1 million-1.5 million, and five-fen coins were also brisk at 500,000-700,000, about twice the previous day.

### National School Teachers Who Have Not Received Salaries Can Contact the National Education Department

[Reported by this newspaper] If the principals of various national schools in the city are blocked in the war zone and cannot bring out the school seal, resulting in their inability to collect the issued salaries, the teachers remaining in Shanghai in the schools can immediately contact the National Education Department of the Education Bureau for remedies.

### Health Bureau Establishes Civilian Casualty Rescue Stations

[Reported by this newspaper] The Health Bureau, considering the increasing need for rescue services in the city, previously planned to actively organize rescue institutions to be specifically responsible.

Among them, the 27th and 28th stations are mobile rescue stations, which are regularly stationed in the bureau for patrol service and have already started working. Some civilian casualties in the war areas have already received rescue. The bureau will send personnel to inspect the equipment and layout of each rescue station after all 30 rescue stations are established. However, due to the current difficult times, rescue equipment such as stretchers needs to be supplemented, and it is hoped that citizens will gather all their strength to assist together.

### National Bank's Various Business Departments' Relocation of Office Canceled

### Wages Paid at Official Exchange Rate, Unable to Maintain Livelihood

Public Utility Workers Request Remedy from Social Affairs Bureau

[Reported by this newspaper] Representatives of the six major public utility trade unions in the city met with Director Zhang of the Labor Division of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday. Because the official silver dollar exchange rate and the black market price are too far apart, and workers are paid wages converted into gold yuan based on the official exchange rate, the losses are huge and they cannot maintain their livelihoods. They requested a remedy. Director Zhang advised the worker representatives that they still hope to accept the current salary payment. Director Chen is also very concerned about this matter and will convene all parties to study the matter in the coming days to find an appropriate solution. The capital side of the six major public utilities will also hold a meeting tomorrow to discuss this issue, and Director Zhang will participate to listen to the opinions of the capital side.

### Police Bureau Orders Pedicab and Rickshaw Industries to Organize Volunteer Transportation Corps, Limited to Three Days to Obtain Registration Certificates with Licenses

[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Police Bureau, following the order of Commander-in-Chief Tang, ordered the organization and training of pedicab and rickshaw drivers to assist in military transportation. The bureau has convened representatives of the respective car merchants' trade associations and workers' unions to discuss the method and organize a Volunteer Transportation Corps to be established in the near future. The organizational outline is as follows: (1) There are about 30,000 double-seater pedicabs and rickshaws in the city, which will be organized into three corps. One corps will be double-seater pedicabs, and two corps will be single-seater pedicabs and rickshaws. Each corps will have about 10,000 vehicles.

The deputy corps commanders of each corps will be selected by the Pedicab and Rickshaw Workers' Union. (4) Each corps commander, under the command of the police chief, is responsible for managing, investigating, controlling, and deploying vehicles. When necessary, the bureau will send personnel to guide and assist in military transportation.

Violators will be severely punished according to wartime laws.

At the same time, the bureau also issued a public notice yesterday stipulating: (1) All car merchants must, within three days of the publication of the notice, bring all vehicle licenses and the identity cards of each car worker to the pedicab or rickshaw trade association for registration and obtain a registration certificate. (2) If any car refuses to register, the license will be revoked and the vehicle confiscated.

Beyond the deadline, it will be considered abandoned and no further correspondence will be made. Duplicate payment receipts will have the smaller amount canceled and filed without further accounting. Tax evasion cases previously discovered that are pending tax payment will be leniently closed without further investigation. Cases that meet the Ministry of Finance's regulations for a 50% tax reduction will be approved leniently, without being implicated in unsettled cases due to some non-compliant operations. Other cases that are time-barred will also be closed and filed without any response. However, merchants who have already participated in the simplified tax collection and administration will not be approved for tax reduction or withdrawal due to poor business or no business, as it affects the entire simplified collection method. It is also heard that in the future, if merchants have any further cases of tax evasion or delays in business tax payments, they will be severely punished.

### Tao Yishan to Convene Deputy District Chiefs for Training Today

### Social Affairs Bureau Mediates Solution to Substitute Rice Distribution Method, Labor and Management Agreement Reached on Four Points at Private Cotton Textile Factories

[Reported by this newspaper] Private cotton textile factories in the city had labor-management disputes due to a reduction in the distribution of substitute rice. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the Labor Division of the Social Affairs Bureau, together with the General Labor Union, convened labor and management representatives of the industry to discuss the method and stipulated four points for the distribution of substitute rice: (1) Six dou of substitute rice will still be issued each month (including one dou of special ration rice). In addition to the one dou of special ration rice, which will be calculated according to the government's ration price, and another one dou calculated at 4 jiao and 8 fen and 4 li per dou, the remaining four dou will be calculated according to the following formula, deducting 2 jiao and 4 fen and 2 li of silver yuan from the wages per dou. The formula is as follows:

0.20 (base salary) × 1.21 × (increase in gold yuan) × 20% (silver yuan conversion) = 0.0242 (silver yuan price per sheng)

### Robbery on Zhejiang South Road

[Reported by this newspaper] Five armed robbers suddenly came to No. 14, Bao'anfang, Zhejiang South Road at noon yesterday. Two spoke with a northern accent and three with a local accent. After entering the room, they drove the residents to a corner and had one robber watch over them. The remaining robbers went upstairs to search through boxes and luggage for an hour. As a result, 75 taels of gold and 300 silver dollars were robbed. By the time the police station in charge received the report and dispatched a police car, the robbers had already escaped.

### Rice Market Still Not Open, Cooking Oil and Flour Soar

Rice market transactions are still stalled, and neither the North nor South markets opened yesterday. Due to the excessive rise in financial commodity prices, it was difficult for cargo owners to quote prices. Rice shops were also less willing to purchase because door-to-door sales were difficult. Therefore, both buyers and sellers adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and no transactions were made until the market closed. The market quotation list was not issued. Door-to-door sales prices followed the rise in gold and silver, and the asking prices were chaotic, with white glutinous rice at 400-450 million.

Cooking Oil

There were slightly more transactions as door-to-door sales suddenly became brisk. Local businesses increased their purchases, and market sentiment rose. Furthermore, due to the rise in gold and silver prices, the increase was particularly sharp. Raw soybean oil was at 1.1 billion, raw rapeseed oil at 950 million, clear oil at 750 million, and tea oil at 900 million.

Grains

Transactions became increasingly light, with only a small amount of soybean and mung bean transactions specializing in local sales. Prices soared, with Pinghu small grains at 225 million and Pudong rapeseed mung beans at 300 million. Lin Huai Guan raw kernels were at 400 million, and others did not open.

Flour

The market had scattered transactions yesterday, and prices soared to unprecedented heights. This was because gold and silver prices were skyrocketing, factory stocks were depleted, and the market supply was extremely scarce. However, actual sales in this area were extremely brisk, and public confidence was very strong, so the prices continued to rise rapidly. The Lao Che flour opened at 73 million in the morning and reached a peak of 77.5 million at the noon closing. The Bing Chuan flour opened at 65 million and quickly rose to the 70 million mark near noon.

### Civil Aviation Passenger Flights Suspended, Airport Peaceful as Usual

[Reported by this newspaper] Neither China nor Central Aviation companies had passenger flights yesterday. In the morning, there were still passenger flights from South China, but because no one contacted them on the ground after arriving over the city, they did not land and flew away. In fact, the airport was as peaceful as usual, and yesterday's suspension was "a case of unnecessary worry." It is heard that the flight personnel of the two companies are prepared to continue working today, and civil aviation flights may resume.

### National Bank Sells 154 Gold Bars, Surge in Gold Market Slightly Dampened

[Reported by this newspaper] The gold market was extremely strong yesterday. Due to the abundance of funds and the increasing ease of cash, investors, seeing the recent tense situation, poured into the financial market, making the market even more chaotic. The rise continued to soar, still creating a situation of demand exceeding supply. The exchange continued to raise the price to 9.5552 billion, once again hitting the upper limit, but there was still no market. Outside the exchange, it opened at 16 billion and 19 billion in the morning, breaking through four levels in an instant. By 10:00 AM, it had already broken the 20 billion mark, reaching as high as 22 billion and 25 billion. Upon hearing the news, the Central Bank took action, entrusting the Da Desheng Gold Shop to sell a total of 154 large bars at 22 billion, 21 billion, and 20 billion, gradually lowering the price to 19.5 billion, slightly suppressing the rise. From 21 billion and 24 billion, it gradually lowered to 18 billion and 21 billion at the noon closing. In the afternoon, trading was scarce, but public confidence was still very strong, and in the evening, it broke through the 20 billion mark again, closing at 20 billion and 25 billion. This was about 80% higher than the previous day.

The US dollar outside the exchange also rose step by step, trading at 32 million and 37 million in the morning, rising through four levels all the way to 45 million and 50 million, closing at 40 million and 45 million at noon.

Cotton cloth prices were readjusted according to the silver dollar exchange rate, but the dark market outside the exchange was rising sharply, making it impossible to trade in gold yuan inside the exchange. Barter trading was still the norm, and the number of quotes was even less than the previous day. Private factory prices continued to be reported as firm.

### Exorbitant Retail Prices for Cigarettes

The exchange was at a standstill, and prices were not listed. However, there were some transactions outside the exchange, and the market was very strong. Retail prices in cigarette stores were shockingly high. Yesterday afternoon, a pack of 20 Qianmen cigarettes was 3.6 million yuan, a pack of 10 Meili cigarettes was 1.5 million yuan, a pack of 20 Yinhang cigarettes was 2.9 million yuan, and a pack of 20 Hong Gaole cigarettes was 2.3 million yuan.

### Residents Near City Suburbs Flee to Central Districts

[Reported by this newspaper] As the Battle for the Defense of Greater Shanghai gradually enters its climax, residents near the edge of the city are again fleeing to the central area. In Nanshi, Zhabei, Yangshupu, and Hongkou, moving vehicles were constantly coming and going throughout yesterday. They had no definite relocation destination, and most of them were temporarily staying with relatives and friends, while a small number were temporarily renting rooms in hotels. Some were also painfully paying huge transfer fees to rent houses in the Western District. A reporter inspected various small hotels last night and found that most of them were full. The hallways were full of boxes and packages, piled up in extreme disarray.

### Desolate Huangpu River Surface
