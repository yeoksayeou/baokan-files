### Joint Memorial Week for Guangdong and Guangzhou Party Members; Deng Wenyi Analyzes the War Situation; The Kuomintang and the National Revolutionary Army Should Thoroughly Awaken

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 9th] Deng Wenyi, Director of the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, attended the Joint Memorial Week for Kuomintang members in Guangdong and Guangzhou on the 9th and analyzed the current war situation. The full text is as follows:

Because the Communist Party wants to carry the war through to the end, the Communist Party has no sincerity in peace talks and uses them as a cover for the Communist Party's preparations for crossing the river and attacking. On April 20, the government rejected the Communist Party's arrogant eight articles and twenty-four demands. Zhu and Mao ordered a general offensive on all fronts on the 21st, with Taiyuan in the north and Nanjing in the south as their primary targets. Due to various reasons, the main one being that the strength of the bandit army exceeded the local National Revolutionary Army several times, the National Revolutionary Army could no longer hold Taiyuan and could not but quickly make a strategic retreat in Nanjing. As the war situation has progressed to a new stage, the future war situation will change to a shift in roles between host and guest. After the National Revolutionary Army puts down the heavy burden of cities it has been carrying, it will gradually gain the initiative and engage in a long-term war with the bandits. The Communist bandits will henceforth carry many urban burdens, and will inevitably be forced to carry out comprehensive operations. After a long period of attrition, the bandit army will eventually follow in the footsteps of the Japanese invasion of China.

Communist Bandit Military Strategy

The Communist bandits, in view of the failed path of the Japanese warlords, realized that there was no quick victory in the military sense. After occupying Nanjing, the Japanese army did not quickly advance to Wuhan, giving the National Government time to move the government from Nanjing to Wuhan, and then from Wuhan to Chongqing, so the Japanese army finally failed. The Communist bandits' recent and future strategy will be "quick victory," and they hope to end the war this year. The Communist bandits' crossing-the-river offensive has four slogans: "Attack Nanjing, isolate Wuhan, liquidate Shanghai, and smash Guangzhou." This illustrates his strategy of a direct attack to the south, and that after "attacking Nanjing," the main force will go through Jiang, Wan, Gan, and directly to Guangdong. This strategy is ideal, but dangerous. They are going deep into enemy territory, although they rely on the support of local communist elements in Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces, and can obtain some supplies and internal support locally. However, the people of South China have a strong and unyielding spirit. They have experienced the Communist bandits' armed uprisings, and they all have experience and lessons in dealing with the Communist Party. They also have considerable organization and strength to deal with the Communist bandits, so the Communist bandits will definitely not be able to do whatever they want. Even if Mao Zedong has formulated deceptive urban policies and industrial and commercial policies, and has repeatedly stated that the actual liquidation of land in Jiangnan will be delayed for five years and that the struggle will be eased, the bandit areas of Tianjin and Northeast North China are all mirrors, and everything is obvious and very clear. This means that the Communist bandits' political strategy does not match his military strategy. His mass base and so-called people's line in South China are very weak, which will make the Communist bandits not dare to venture to drive straight in. Once he encounters resistance, he will stop.

Comparison of Strengths

Over the past year, the strength of the Communist bandits and the National Revolutionary Army has waxed and waned. The reason why the National Revolutionary Army has suffered losses and lost territory is not because the bandit army is strong and has defeated the National Revolutionary Army, but because the Communist bandits used political offensives and propaganda to first disarm the National Revolutionary Army spiritually and deceive young students, peasants, and workers. Therefore, in the Northeast and North China, whether it was Changchun, Shenyang, Jinzhou, or even Beiping and Zhangjiakou, there were no fierce battles. The strength of Lin Biao and Nie Rongzhen was not damaged, while the bandit East China Xuzhou team went through an unprecedented battle of more than three months, and the main force of Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng was exhausted. Now that the bandit army has undergone four months of reorganization and thorough general mobilization, although dozens of field armies and regular troops have been formed, claiming to be two million people, there are also equal military district reserves and militia. Now, two-thirds of the troops, about 44 armies, have been mobilized to cross the river and attack. This force is considerable in quantity, but in terms of quality, except for Lin Biao's ten armies, the teams of Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng are mostly composed of newly gathered people, some of whom are prisoners of the National Revolutionary Army, some are recruits, and the Northeastern youths who were forced to join the army in the Northeast by Lin Biao are unwilling to fight in Jiangnan for a long time. This means that the internal strength of the Communist bandits is very fragile and cannot withstand long-term serious blows. The strength of the National Revolutionary Army, when totaled up, is not less than that of the Communist bandits. It is still superior to the Communist bandits in terms of quantity and quality, although some of it has been recently reorganized and the troops are slightly scattered in various places. Fortunately, since the war will be a long-term war, the National Revolutionary Army has sufficient talent and cadres, and the potential strength of the southeast, northwest, and southwest is still considerable. As long as there are thorough reforms and mobilization methods in terms of morale, popular support, and economic materials, local advantages can still be obtained everywhere. At least it can be said that the strength of the Communist bandits and the National Revolutionary Army is equal.

How to Continue the National Self-Defense War

Because the National Revolutionary Army's forces have not been concentrated quickly, the natural barrier of the Yangtze River has not been well utilized, and the new defense lines in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and South China do not seem strong enough, pessimists and propagandists of the Communist bandits are spreading terror rumors. In the first ten days after the retreat from Nanjing, Shanghai was indeed quite panicked, but after a week of strengthening war preparations, it stabilized. The fighting time in the Shanghai area will be quite long. The National Revolutionary Army still controls hundreds of thousands of strong National Revolutionary Army troops in Fujian, Jiangxi, and Hunan, Hubei. If the Communist bandits want to go deep into South China to attack Guangdong, they will be severely threatened or attacked on both the left and right flanks. Guangdong also has time to strengthen war preparations. If the potential strength of Guangdong and Guangxi is brought into play, and some troops are transferred from other provinces to Guangdong for reinforcement, it will not be easy, and even impossible, for the Communist bandits to smash Guangzhou in the shortest time. Gaining time, avoiding decisive battles, defending South China, important strategic strongholds, and severely attacking the bandit army are the recent key points of the National Revolutionary Army's operations. With the base of Taiwan and the support of the northwest and southwest, the situation of a long-term war can be formed, and the war can definitely be fought. With total mobilization and comprehensive operations, the military and civilians of the southeast, southwest, and northwest will soon know the Communist bandits' conspiracy to destroy the country and exterminate the race. The local peace of the Beiping style cannot appear again. The Kuomintang and the National Revolutionary Army should thoroughly awaken. Corrupt officials and politicians will run away quickly. Only by thoroughly implementing total war and total mobilization can forces be concentrated. The slogan of "those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength" during the War of Resistance against Japan should now be changed to "go bankrupt to protect property, risk your life to protect your life." All those who want freedom, survival, and to live should rise up and participate in this long-term comprehensive war, step by step, with each person fighting for themselves. It is not possible without doing so. The revolutionary spirit of Guangdong twenty years ago should be carried forward. The Communist bandit army will be wiped out when it arrives in Guangdong. The rampant momentum of the Communist bandits has reached its peak, and it will decline after this.

The military and civilians of all of China, and especially all of Guangdong, should start taking action, fighting for anti-communism, national salvation, and free survival. The enemy is not scary, there is no need to be pessimistic and negative, everyone should stand up, be strongly united, tightly organized, and fight the Communist bandits to the end. I believe that after a long battle, the Communist bandits will definitely be defeated and the National Revolutionary Army will definitely win.

### Communist Troops in Northern Hubei are Harsh and Tyrannical; The People Rise Up in Resistance

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 9th] According to a certain gentleman from Shashi who came here, since the Communist troops invaded and occupied northern Hubei, various liquidation struggles and forced grain contribution and conscription movements have emerged one after another. Now, the people of Xiangyang, Nanzhang, Yicheng, and other counties, unable to withstand various cruel oppressions, have risen up in resistance, successively destroying dozens of county and district units of the Communist troops, killing dozens of Communist officers and soldiers, and seizing 47 light and heavy machine guns, pistols, rifles, and countless supplies.

### Xuejiadao, Opposite Qingdao; Communist Troops Launch a Fierce Attack and Suffer Heavy Losses

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 9th] A battle occurred on Xuejiadao, opposite Qingdao. This morning, citizens were awakened by the rumble of artillery fire. The bandits mobilized local communist elements, approximately 10,000 strong, and launched a fierce attack on the National Revolutionary Army's position at 4:00 AM this morning using human wave tactics. They were met with a fierce counterattack by our defending troops. Upon hearing the news, our naval authorities immediately dispatched three warships to assist in the battle, bombarding the bandit army's positions with concentrated fire. The bandits suffered too many losses and began to waver by noon, starting to collapse and retreat. The National Revolutionary Army's pursuit forces have crossed Wujiazhuang and Zhangjiawan and are advancing.

### Fujian Decides on Contingency Measures; Strengthens Political, Economic, Military, and Social Measures; Large Armies Gather in Northern Fujian, Tranquility Remains

[This Newspaper, Fuzhou, 9th] Yushan and Qianshan, on the border of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian, have successively issued warnings. The Fujian border is approaching the front lines. Although Wuyi Mountain is a natural barrier, the disturbances of local communist elements are worrying. In order to prevent problems before they occur, the provincial authorities have decided to strengthen measures to meet the needs of the times. It is reported that it has been initially decided to take the county as the basis and decide on two matters of attention for contingencies. In the political aspect, the powers of county magistrates and section chiefs will be increased, forces will be strengthened, security will be ensured, and non-essential organs and undertakings may be reduced or cut as necessary. In the economic aspect, taxes may be collected in silver dollars or in kind, grain administration will be reorganized, arrears of land tax will be urged, grain contributions may be organized as necessary to replenish military food, and self-defense special donations may be organized to provide funds for contingencies. In the military aspect, the promotion of conscription will be actively assisted, and local reputable and capable people will be called upon to lead the people to organize self-defense forces to assist the government in defending their homes. In the social aspect, the stability of local order should be carefully noted, refugees throughout the territory should be properly relieved, and military organs should be assisted in the rescue and placement of wounded and sick officers and soldiers.

[This Newspaper, Fuzhou, 9th] Large armies are gathering in northern Fujian. Zhu Shaoliang declared at the provincial government meeting on the 9th that northern Fujian is peaceful and nothing is happening. All telephones in the province are working smoothly. Only the county magistrate of Guangze County has abandoned his post and fled, and a decision has been made to arrest him. The food problem that everyone is concerned about is also not a cause for concern. 200,000 dan of Jiangxi rice have been exchanged for salt and will be shipped to the province immediately. In addition, the United Logistics Shanghai Equipment Supply Office has 90 million packages of rice stored in eastern Jiangxi, and it is being negotiated to allocate and transport them to Fujian. Furthermore, the provincial government has purchased a large amount of flour in Hong Kong, and the central government has purchased rice in Siam, with a quota of 30,000 tons allocated to Fujian Province, which will be shipped in continuously. Furthermore, Chen Gongbei, Director of the Provincial Land and Grain Office, and He Jie, Director of the Storage and Transportation Section, are scheduled to go to Taiwan on the 10th to negotiate the exchange of Fujian native products, timber, and mushrooms for 100,000 packages of military grain, so the future of food supply in Fujian Province is very promising. Furthermore, Shi Juemin, Deputy Commander of the Fujian Provincial Security Force and Director of the Fuzhou Police Bureau, is scheduled to go to Taiwan on the 10th on official business.

### Bai Chongxi Receives Consuls of Various Countries in Hankou; Briefly Reports on Our Current Situation

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 9th] Bai, the Commander of the Central China Military and Political Office, held a tea party at the office at 4:00 PM on the 9th to receive consuls from various countries stationed in Hankou. During the party, Bai made a brief report on the current situation in our country. Bai first stated that since the government advocated peace, it has repeatedly compromised and made the greatest concessions since April. Finally, because the CCP put forward eight articles and twenty-four harsh surrender conditions, peace broke down. The ambition of the communist bandits lies in turning the entire China red and then carrying out their world revolution. Our government is determined to lead the military and civilians of the country to rise up and fight in order to ensure the freedom of speech and life of the people of the country, to save the country and the nation from the current crisis, and to make efforts for world peace. He continued: Wuhan is a strategic location, and war is inevitable. I am sincerely afraid that this will damage the lives and property of foreigners. If the consulates and foreigners stationed in Hankou intend to leave Hankou for other places, this office will do its best to assist and facilitate transportation to ensure safety.

[This Newspaper, Hankou, 9th] Commander Bai Chongxi is scheduled to invite leaders from all walks of life to talk on the morning of the 10th, and will report on the situation in Central China.

### Guangdong Needs a Brand New Situation; The Guangzhou Central Daily Publishes an Article

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 9th] The Central Daily here today published an article entitled "Guangdong Needs a Brand New Situation," stating that the government has already moved south to Guangzhou, so Guangdong's mission for the future history of China is greater than in the past. Although Guangdong has become the actual capital today, the conditions are still inadequate. Therefore, the newspaper believes that Guangdong at this time and place should strengthen its defenses and stabilize its economy. The newspaper first pointed out that the capital where the government is located must have strong defenses. Judging from the current situation in Guangdong, local communist elements are acting recklessly and society is unstable. The other day, Legislative Yuan member Xiao Zheng and others suggested that Guangdong Province should add nine armies. If this point is not easy to succeed, then it can first organize and train the strong private forces that can be utilized. Secondly, the current economic situation in Guangdong is chaotic. The government's reform of the currency system is still in the planning stage, while public utilities and transportation businesses are collecting silver dollars, and the gold round coupon has lost its value as currency. Gold and foreign currencies are causing waves, and the government cannot stop them. People are distracted by the economy and are exhausted, and they inevitably feel indifferent to the suppression measures. The newspaper finally said that the military suppression of bandits has reached the point of close combat, so the security of Guangdong is actually the security of the entire free China. Therefore, it requires the central government to quickly strengthen the military and stabilize the economy, so that Guangdong can be the lighthouse for the revival of China.

### The Wuhan Temporary Relief Association Will Fail if It Does Not Receive Permission

[This Newspaper, Hankou, 9th] The Temporary Relief Committee organized by elders of Hubei Province and people from all walks of life in Wuhan will likely fail because it has not received permission from the authorities.

### Legislative Yuan Committee Review Meeting; President Tong Reports on the Reasons and Process of the Reassembly in Nanjing; Hopes to Form an Investigation Committee to Thoroughly Investigate

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 9th] The Legislative Yuan held a committee review meeting at 3:00 PM on the 9th. 208 committee members attended, chaired by Xu Yuanquan. First, President Tong reported on the process and evacuation of the reassembly in Nanjing. Then, Secretary-General Chen Kewen reported on the affairs and financial situation, and the process of the Nanjing evacuation. Committee members Peng Chunshi, Pan Yuying, Peng Zhenhuan, Chen Zifeng, Lu Zonglian, and others successively spoke, asking questions about the affairs of the Yuan. Finally, President Tong replied, and hoped that a proposal to form an investigation committee would be formally proposed at the Yuan meeting on the 10th, and that a number of committee members would be elected to conduct a thorough investigation to clarify the truth. If he himself does have illegal activities, he will be dealt with according to the law. He hopes that his colleagues in the Legislative Yuan will not be impulsive and avoid hurting harmony. The meeting was adjourned at around 6:00 PM.

When President Tong reported on the issue of the reassembly in Nanjing, he said that some colleagues did not quite understand this matter. In the past, because there were many problems, there was no opportunity to explain to you. In early February of this year, after the government withdrew from Nanjing, Nanjing was empty and almost became a state of anarchy. Many committee members present today saw this situation. After research by several leaders, I was instructed to fly to Guangzhou with President Yu on February 8 to first invite important leaders to return to Nanjing to support the spiritual power of the Nanjing government, and then engage in stabilizing the military and the people's hearts as a preparation. This situation was not good to announce to the outside world, so President Yu and I agreed in advance to see how the preparations were going here. At that time, the most important thing was to invite President Sun and Vice President Wu to return to Nanjing to make a detailed plan for the overall situation. When I was in Guangzhou, the newspaper published that I had agreed to reassemble in Guangzhou, which was not true.

On February 12, President Yu and I flew to Shanghai. After I reported the situation here, a colleague said, "President, do you think it is better to reassemble in Nanjing or in Guangzhou?" My reply was to listen to the opinions of the majority. Everyone said that they wanted to be in Guangzhou and Guangzhou was ready. If they wanted to be in Nanjing, they would prepare immediately. On the evening of the 13th, I took the car back to Nanjing to report to Acting President Li. On the 16th, I went to Shanghai to attend the symposium. There were more than 100 committee members present. There were many speakers at that time, and after a very enthusiastic discussion, it was unanimously decided to reassemble in Nanjing, and the date was decided by the President of the Yuan. When I returned to Nanjing on the 13th, there were many telegrams and letters from various places. Some of these telegrams and letters advocated reassembling in Nanjing, and some advocated reassembling in Guangzhou. According to the statistics, 300 people advocated reassembling in Nanjing, and more than 100 people advocated reassembling in Guangzhou. After returning to Nanjing from attending the Shanghai symposium, Tong Jingren firmly advocated reassembling in Nanjing and wanted me to announce it on the 17th. I said that the funding problem must be solved first. Later, I negotiated with Minister Xu on funding, and Minister Xu agreed to borrow first. According to the Constitution, the meeting will be reassembled within two months. There are only 28 days in February. Calculating the journey from all sides to Nanjing, it takes at least one week, so it was decided to start registration on the 20th. These are the reasons and processes for the reassembly in Nanjing.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 9th] More than 20 Legislative Yuan members, including Gao Tingzi, flew to Guangzhou on the 9th to attend the Legislative Yuan meeting. Another 40 Legislative Yuan members will fly to Guangzhou in two batches on the 11th and 16th.

### Hubei Provincial Government Moves to Enshi; Decides to Establish Southern Hubei Administrative Office

### In Memory of Deceased Naval Officers and Soldiers: Memorial Service Held Yesterday at the New Life Club; Foreign and Chinese Warships Stationed in Shanghai Fly Flags at Half-Mast for One Day in Mourning

[Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch] A memorial service for the deceased naval officers and soldiers who sacrificed themselves in suppressing the rebellion, including Captain Lu Weiyuan of the Yongxing warship and over 300 other officers and soldiers, was solemnly held yesterday (the 9th) at 9:00 AM at the New Life Club on Weihaiwei Road in this city. Those in attendance included Gui Yongqing, Tang Enbo (represented by Chen Daqing), Fang Zhi, Chen Liang (represented by Shen Chuanli), Wan Wuqing, Xu Mingya, as well as heads of various naval headquarters units, officers and soldiers from various warships, and representatives from various sectors, totaling over 800 people. Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing presided over the ceremony, with Zhou Xianzhang, Dong Muzeng, Ma Deji, Ma Jizhuang, Wang Tianchi, Liu Qingsheng, and Tao Diya serving as accompanying officiants. The hall was filled with wreaths and elegiac couplets, creating a solemn and respectful atmosphere. President Chiang Kai-shek presented an inscription that read, "Their Spirit Fills the Rivers and Mountains," He Yingqin offered an elegy that read, "Elite of the Nation," and Tang Enbo's elegy stated, "Join Forces to Stem the Tides, Military Campaigns are Difficult; Summon Souls to the Distant Shores, the River Flows with Sorrowful Sounds." Gui Yongqing's elegy read, "To Preserve the National Pulse, They Sacrificed Themselves for Freedom; The Universe Admires Their Loyalty and Steadfastness, Their Spirit is Immortal; Vowing to Ride the Winds, They Carry on the Legacy Upon Encountering the Red Flames; The Ocean Remains Vast, the Great Cause Ever Renewed." The memorial rituals proceeded in order, lasting for forty minutes, with an atmosphere of solemnity and sorrow throughout.

Following the service, Commander-in-Chief Gui gathered all the naval officers and soldiers present to deliver a brief address. General Gui first expressed his deep sorrow to the deceased officers and soldiers, expressing his infinite regret for not being able to personally visit and comfort the families of the fallen. He continued, "After the heroic and glorious sacrifice of over three hundred of our naval officers and soldiers, it has proven that ninety percent of the Chinese Navy has ambition, courage, ideals, and understanding. Our naval officers and soldiers are all incomparably loyal and brave warriors. In the past, everyone greatly neglected the Navy." General Gui Yongqing, speaking of the heroic and glorious sacrifice of Warden Lu Weiyuan of the Yongxing warship and other officers and soldiers, moved all the officers and soldiers in attendance to tears. "After the test and lessons of the blood of these heroes, it also proves that the fighting spirit of the Chinese Navy is more magnificent than that of any navy in the world's history. Therefore, the combat path that our Chinese Navy takes is more difficult, magnificent, and heroic." General Gui said, "Only those who do not enjoy killing can unify China." He said, "Facing our enemy - the Communist Party that betrays the nation - our naval officers and soldiers must remember these bloody lessons and fight even more bravely." "Today is the most difficult time of our revolution, especially for the Navy. We must further recognize that this most difficult time is also our most glorious time. We must be more ambitious, courageous, and determined, and fight even more bravely. Continuing the fighting spirit of the eight hundred fifty nautical miles along the Yangtze River, we must create an even stronger force in naval operations and eliminate the enemy."

Furthermore, the naval warships of the United States and Britain stationed in Shanghai, as well as the various fleets and naval combat command units under the Chinese Navy, in order to mourn the Chinese naval officers and soldiers who died in the suppression of the rebellion, specially flew their flags at half-mast for one day yesterday, the "9th."

Memorial Oration at the Memorial Service

The memorial oration at the memorial service is as follows: "On this ninth day of May in the thirty-eighth year of the Republic of China, Naval Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing, leading all officers and soldiers, respectfully offers incense, flowers, and spiced wine in sacrifice before the spirits of the naval officers and soldiers who died in suppressing the rebellion, saying: 'We are the rhinoceros-armored force, the Great Wall on the rivers and seas; our warships cleave the waves, under the moon and stars. From the beginning of our military construction, we have been determined to be vigorous and refined, hoping to build up our strength and consolidate peace. But the red flames have grown fiercer day by day, bringing disaster to the country and harming the people. The three armies join forces to suppress the rebellion and rectify names. The Northern Fleet supports our warships in rapid voyages, eliminating the enemy along the Yangtze and Huai rivers, earning remarkable prestige. But the lurking dragons stirred and moved, forming a turbulent current. Over thousands of miles of waterway, every night brings surprises. Day and night, we are vigilant, guarding against the lurking bandits. We are the mainstay in the torrent, engaging in relentless cannon battles. Our officers and soldiers fight bravely, their will forged in iron, vowing to guard the natural barrier in order to restore the nation. Though arms are broken and heads severed, our steadfastness is strengthened. We stand firm, as stable as the mountains and as deep as the abyss. The landscape has changed color, the Central Plains have sunk into darkness. We sacrifice ourselves to repay the nation, heroically achieving benevolence. Alas, my compatriots, you have fought a hundred battles and sacrificed your lives. Alive, you were fighters; in death, you are heroic spirits. The river water is endless, the sea waves connect to the sky. Our banners are in sight, ready to face the winds. Your great ambitions have not been fulfilled, our desire to restore the nation remains the same. Return, O souls, and guide our vanguard. Alas!'"

### Opinion of U.S. Military Officials in Tokyo: Communist Attack on Hong Kong Could Lead to World War III

[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] Reliable British sources here confirm that the Communists will attack Hong Kong. Some U.S. officials stationed in Japan doubt whether the approval of the Atlantic Pact necessarily requires the United States to participate in the defense of British colonies. A well-informed British source said on the 9th that whether Hong Kong will be attacked is no longer a question; the question is when it will be attacked. The Communists have repeatedly demanded the elimination of all foreign influence from Chinese territory. The Communist army shelled British warships in the Yangtze River. Neutral observers say that the Communists are clearly not afraid of Britain. They believe that the Communists will inevitably clash with Britain over Hong Kong, at least diplomatically.

At the same time, if the Communists attack Hong Kong, the question of whether the Atlantic Pact countries will assist each other outside the North Atlantic area will arise. Some U.S. military officials here believe that if Britain and the Communists actually clash in Hong Kong, it will form a potential trigger for World War III; therefore, it is a conflict between the East and West blocs. Some people believe that if the Atlantic Pact is not limited by region, U.S. forces stationed in Japan may rush to Hong Kong to assist in the defense, but this must await orders from the Supreme Command in Washington.

[Associated Press, London, 8th] The Daily Mail's editorial on the 8th, titled "Britain's Crisis in China," stated: "The Western blockade has just ended; when will the Eastern blockade begin? Hong Kong may become a second Berlin. Has the government prepared Hong Kong to deal with possible aggression? The United States and Britain should be united on this point. Hong Kong is an important part of the American Pacific border. The Soviet Union has almost lost a battle in the West, but they hope to lose in the West and gain in the East. If we recognize in time that Hong Kong is a new political symbol of our determination to resist Communist oppression, the Soviet Union may also fail in the East."

### From Wuhu to Shanghai

[Special Report for This Newspaper] Recently, this reporter's relative, Mr. Xu, escaped from the Communist-controlled area and arrived in Shanghai. This reporter made a special visit to him. Mr. Xu had been doing business in Wuhu. This time, he left Wuhu and returned east on the 23rd of last month when Wuhu fell. He passed through Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, and other places, braving the elements and experiencing hardship. It took him more than ten days to reach Shanghai. The areas mentioned above have been cut off from news from Shanghai since their fall. There must be many people along the Nanjing-Shanghai line who have family members in these areas and are very concerned about the recent situation in their hometowns. Therefore, the following is a compilation of what I learned from the meeting, to share with the readers of this newspaper.

Evacuation from Wuhu

Wuhu was originally defended by the 20th Army under Yang Gancai. On the evening of the 21st of last month, Yang's troops received news that they were about to withdraw. On the 22nd, the families of the soldiers began to depart first. That evening, Yang's troops also received official orders to withdraw. Upon hearing the news, the people of Wuhu panicked and fled with the elderly and the young. Mr. Xu also rushed to the Jiangnan Railway Station with the crowded crowd on the morning of the 23rd. He managed to buy a ticket and climbed onto the roof of the train. The train left eastward around 8:00 AM and arrived at Zhonghua Gate in Nanjing at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. It was precisely during the vacuum period when the National Army was withdrawing and the Communist Army had not yet arrived. The situation in Nanjing was chaotic. Robberies occurred frequently. All the shops were closed, and many large windows were shattered into powder. Even street vendors were hard to find. The streets were filled with all kinds of people. The Communist Army had not yet entered the city that day, but colorful slogans had already been posted all over the streets. Mr. Xu was fortunate to meet an old man named Ji and stayed at his house because it was impossible to find a hotel at that time. Two days later, the old man introduced him to a room in the house of a woman in Xiaguan so that he could wait for the train to return east. The newly built Junzhan Building in Xiaguan was completely destroyed, almost razed to the ground. He heard that the train service had been restored, but it was for military use and civilians were not allowed to ride.

On the Road from Nanjing to Changzhou

Mr. Xu stayed in Nanjing for several days and went back and forth between Xiaguan and Hepingmen several times, but he had no chance to get on the train. Just when he was feeling depressed, he met a friend named Xu at Hepingmen, who also planned to come to Shanghai. So they agreed to travel together. Finally, on the morning of May 1st, they took a truck to Zhenjiang for the price of one silver dollar per person, just like traveling on the inland highways in the past. It was very emotional. After arriving in Zhenjiang around 4:00 PM, they had some congee and rushed to the train station. Mr. Xu and others repeatedly pleaded with the Communist sentries. Until 12:00 AM at night, they were allowed to enter the platform. They saw a locomotive with its fire lit, waiting to depart. After inquiring, they learned that it was going to Danyang, so they climbed onto the locomotive. After about an hour, the Communist troops arrived and boarded the train one after another. Then the train traveled east. At dawn, the train stopped at Lingkou. Mr. Xu and others had not slept all night and were hungry. They walked to Benniu and had a meal around 1:00 PM. They also tried to find a vehicle and finally took a car to Changzhou for the price of eight dimes of silver dollars per person and stayed at the hotel. Shops in Zhenjiang and Changzhou were already open, but there were very few customers.

City Scenes of Suzhou and Wuxi

The next morning, he found a small steamship to Wuxi, which cost one and a half silver dollars per person. He arrived around noon. Without having a meal, he transferred to a boat to Suzhou and arrived around 4:00 PM. Suzhou and Wuxi still seemed quite lively on the surface. On the way, gold yuan could no longer be used. In addition to silver dollars, people's currency, and Central China currency, nickel coins and lead coins also became commonly used auxiliary currencies. The general cost of living was very high. The price of rice in Zhenjiang and Suzhou was about eight silver dollars per load.

After staying in Suzhou for one night, he took a sailboat the next morning and traveled to Lujiabang, which took about a day and a half. He arrived safely at Lujiabang and then took the Nanjing-Shanghai train to Shanghai.

### Central Government Agencies Stationed in Xinjiang Request to Receive Silver Dollars

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 8th] As Xinjiang Province issues silver dollar notes, and gold yuan is about to lose its value in circulation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the High Court, the Telecommunications Bureau, the Post Office, the Grain Bureau, the Customs, and other central government agencies stationed in Xinjiang have jointly sent an urgent telegram to the central government, requesting that funds and salaries be issued in silver dollars, and that a special plane be dispatched monthly to transport them to Dihua in order to maintain operations.

### Decision to Temporarily Close New Well at Yumen Oil Mine

[This Newspaper, Jiuquan Dispatch, 9th] This year's new well, K-15, at the Yumen Oil Mine, has reached a depth of 993 meters, breaking the mine's record of 972 meters for well depth. It is extremely beneficial to the geological research of the oil field there. However, because the well will produce a large amount of salt water after completion, it has been decided to temporarily close it in order to avoid wasting materials.

### Gu Jiaqi Assassination Case: Magistrate of Fenghuang County Not Harmed

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 9th] The magistrate of Fenghuang County, Tian Mingyu, who was killed by bandits at the same time as the newly appointed member of the Hunan Provincial Government, Gu Jiaqi, has now been confirmed by sources here to be a mistake. It was Tian Wanlong, the speaker of the Fenghuang County Council. Magistrate Tian is currently in his office and has not left the county. Speaker Tian was invited by Member Gu to the province. Another victim who died at the same time as Gu was Yang Zhongpu, who had served as the magistrate of Fenghuang County and was currently the director of the Political Work Department of the Fourteenth Army. Yang was under the order of General Song Xilian and was traveling with Dai Jitao and Shi Honggui from Changde to Fenghuang to visit Chen Quzhen. After completing the task, he left Fenghuang with Gu Jiaqi and was tragically killed.

### China to Negotiate with Siam; CNAC Plane Lands in Bangkok

[Reuters, Singapore, 8th] Several Chinese government officials are about to fly to Bangkok to assist China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and the Siamese government in negotiations to allow CNAC aircraft to land in Bangkok in order to expand its Southeast Asian routes to Singapore. According to CNAC personnel here, the Chinese government hopes that the negotiations will be completed quickly and are unrelated to the domestic situation in China. It is also not preparing to transport evacuees to Singapore on CNAC planes. Although CNAC planes can fly directly from Hong Kong to Singapore, it is not very profitable without intermediate landing stations, so it is necessary to negotiate landing rights with the Siamese government.

### Editorial: The Price Problem at the Present Stage

Since the price control dam collapsed, the gold yuan has followed the old path of the late legal tender. Initially, the rate of price increases was still very slight, and the period of fluctuations was still cyclical. But today, due to the dramatic changes in the objective situation and the excessive expansion of credit, prices are changing every day, especially in Guangzhou, where prices are rising several times a day, which is most alarming.

Taking Guangzhou's prices last week as an example, the Hong Kong dollar opened at 1 million yuan on Friday and closed at 900,000 yuan. Gold was 405 yuan per bar in Hong Kong dollars, U.S. dollars were 5.6 million yuan, and silver dollars were 6.5 million yuan. But by Saturday, the price surge rose sharply. The Hong Kong dollar rose to 2.1 million yuan, the U.S. dollar to 13 million yuan, and the silver dollar to 14 million yuan. The change in just one night was so huge that it was unbelievable, or like a feeling of being separated by a lifetime. The eras of the German mark, the Russian ruble, the Hungarian pengő, were probably not so bad. Therefore, not only ordinary people have no way to cope with life, but even the senior officials in charge of finance are feeling helpless. If this continues, what will become of the national economy and people's livelihood!

The recent surge in prices is superficially due to popular unrest and market chaos, but it is actually caused by the malignant inflation of the gold yuan and the shrinking of production capacity. Originally, everything in the world accumulates gradually and erupts suddenly. There is no such thing as a miracle that "falls from the sky." Moreover, the current complex and multifaceted prices are not that simple. Especially today's currency and prices promote and cycle each other, which is one and two, and two and one. To achieve overall economic stability, it is necessary to take a two-pronged approach: control issuance on one hand, and control prices and increase production on the other, in order to be effective. Finance Minister Liu stated in his speech in Guangzhou that the recent price increases were due to the issuance of local currency in various places, which crowded out the gold yuan. This is actually a seemingly correct but actually incorrect assertion.

Although the issuing agency is keeping the number of gold yuan issued secret, we can assert that it has exceeded the amount of legal tender issued in the past, due to the massive military and administrative expenses that are taken at will. In addition, the area of use is shrinking, so the gold yuan flooded the market, and a natural depreciation occurred. At the same time, after Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places were successively abandoned, the general situation changed rapidly. People bought materials or gold notes to preserve purchasing power. Due to the rush to abandon the gold yuan, prices became more expensive and the value of the currency fell. Moreover, the government's "magic weapon" for stabilizing the value of the currency - the policy of buying and selling - has been impossible to implement since the gold and silver were transported south. Therefore, how can we blame the currency for its tragic fall? How can we blame prices for soaring?

According to the principle of prices, prices can remain balanced if the increase in currency is matched by an increase in the supply of materials. However, under the current conditions of traffic disruption and transportation paralysis, there are major problems in the procurement of raw materials and the supply of power and fuel. If we purchase from abroad, the exchange rate is extremely high, which increases the burden of costs. This will inevitably cause the price of products to be lower than the cost, and how can manufacturers maintain operations? In addition, recently, due to the turbulent situation, bankers are mostly concerned about the safety of loans and investments, and the financing of industrial capital is becoming increasingly difficult. As a result, the allocation of manufacturers' operating funds cannot be carried out smoothly. In addition, in recent years, North China has experienced water shortages, and the general purchasing power is extremely weak, resulting in sluggish sales and hindering the output of products. Even if products are reluctantly sold at low prices, it is difficult to replenish raw materials. On the other hand, due to heavy taxes and high wages, various difficult factors make industrialists hesitate and feel extremely disheartened, resulting in a pessimistic attitude. Therefore, the phenomenon of suspending work and reducing production is everywhere. At this time, although industry has stalled and legitimate business is in decline, speculation and hoarding are rampant. People are addicted to the侥倖"get rich quick" mentality of "gaining without labor." How can we expect productive efficiency and increased supply of materials in this kind of murky environment? On the contrary, the imbalance between supply and demand makes prices more expensive. Facing such a dangerous situation, how can the authorities suppress prices if they do not start from the fundamental issue of increasing the supply of materials?

It is undeniable that the current torrent of prices has destroyed the structure of the economy, and the prospects for prices are even bleaker. This situation is extremely serious. The stability of the economy depends on prices. The prerequisite for stabilizing prices is only to start by stopping the policy of inflating the currency, slowing down the circulation rate of the currency, and strengthening the production mechanism. Otherwise, everything is empty talk.

### Important Step Towards Democratic Party Line: New Constitution of West Germany Established; Guaranteeing Freedom of Belief and Speech for the People; Federal Government to be Formed in Mid-July

[United Press, Bonn, Germany, 8th] The first constitution of the German government since Hitler's defeat was established today. The West German Constituent Assembly passed its third reading minutes before midnight on the fourth anniversary of the victory. Fifty-three voted in favor, and only one Communist and ten Bavarian right-wingers voted against it. Bavarian representatives said that the new constitution failed to give sufficient power to the states. The Communists have always opposed the independent establishment of a West German state. The Constituent Assembly has been discussing for eight months, and when the final voting results were announced today, there was a thunderous applause from the audience. The Speaker will send a copy of the constitution to the military governors of the three occupying powers, Britain, France, and the United States, for approval. The constitution contains 146 articles, stipulating the establishment of a federal democratic government to govern the 46 million people in the American, British, and French occupation zones of West Germany, pending the establishment of a unified German government. Elections will be held in the three occupation zones to form a parliament. The new government is scheduled to take office on July 15. The new constitution also stipulates that the red, black, and gold flag of the Weimar Republic will be the national flag of West Germany, completing a historic event. The Bonn Constitution opens a new page in German history, and the era of Nazi dictatorship and death cell terror officially ends from this point forward. The new constitution also stipulates the abolition of the death penalty, no army, and neither the president nor the parliament has the power to declare war. Conspirators of aggression will be severely punished, and national sovereignty belongs to the European Federation. People, regardless of gender, race, creed, language, or political views, have freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, and belief. Censorship of post, telegraph, and news is absolutely prohibited. The new constitution adopts the British and American model, giving specified powers to the federal government, while the remaining powers are reserved by the states. The parliament adopts a bicameral system.

[Agence France-Presse, Frankfurt, 9th] The premiers of the eleven West German states will meet in Godesberg on Friday to discuss various issues following the adoption of the Bonn Constitution.

### Bevin Discusses the Purpose of the Four Foreign Ministers Meeting: Planning for World Peace, Britain Guarantees Consideration of the Interests of All German People, Hopes to See European Stability Last for Two Hundred Years

[United Press, Berlin, 9th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin flew to the British-occupied zone of Germany from the Tempelhof US military airfield today. US Military Governor Clay personally saw him off at the airport. Before departing, Bevin happily told reporters, "The upcoming Paris Four Foreign Ministers Meeting will plan for world peace."

[Reuters, Berlin, 8th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin stated here today that when the Foreign Ministers Meeting convenes in Paris on May 23rd, resolutions will be reached based on a final peace treaty settlement. Bevin emphasized that efforts must be made to obtain a plan that allows the people of Europe to join hands and prosper together. Bevin arrived here yesterday from London to inspect the Berlin airlift situation. He delivered a speech to West Berlin city officials, stating: "If I had come here a week ago, I could only lament with you. But today, the dark clouds have dissipated, and the future appears brighter. Britain opposes any totalitarian system, whether it be communist totalitarianism or Nazi totalitarianism. We believe that mankind must have spiritual freedom, so that they have no fear in their existence." This morning, Foreign Secretary Bevin addressed British troops, stating that the airlift would continue, and British troops must continue to be stationed in Germany to fulfill their responsibilities. At a press conference, Bevin also stated, "I believe that the real key to peace lies in maintaining stability in Europe for at least two hundred years, which of course requires diligent work and patience. I hope that the German region of Berlin will be filled with freedom, with free elections and free newspapers. I want to see the German people freely use their strength to rebuild their cities. A country or a city can only survive based on the spirit of freedom." Speaking of the Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, Bevin said that the four powers must find a way at this conference to achieve a proper solution to the entire European problem. A reporter asked if the chances of success at this meeting were better than they were eighteen months ago. Bevin said that at least they were no worse than before. A reporter also asked if developments in the Far East were more important than developments in Europe. Bevin firmly replied in the negative. A reporter asked for the reason for the Communist Party's policy change. Bevin replied that he could not answer this question because he was not a member of Communist politics. Bevin is staying at the residence of British Army Commander-in-Chief General Robertson in Berlin. This morning, he met there with US Governor Clay, British Governor Robertson, and French Deputy Governor Noiret for over an hour.

US military government officials and some Germans say that this compromise is very possible because the dual currency system is a major issue in the Cold War against Germany.

### Soviet Interference with English, American, and Russian Radio Broadcasts

Strong Soviet Noise Overwhelms Western Voices

[Reuters, London, 8th] The radio broadcasting war between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union resumed at 3:15 this afternoon when the BBC and the Voice of America began broadcasting news in Russian. Only one minute after the English and American radio stations began broadcasting in Russian, powerful Soviet radio stations focused their radio waves to interfere with the Western radio stations. Here, it can be found that most of Moscow's domestic radio stations are silent and are slowly moving wavelengths until the strange noise overwhelms the voices of the Western radio stations. When the Russian-language broadcasts of the Western radio stations ended, the Soviet interference also stopped. The voices of Moscow radio became clearly audible again. Previously, Moscow Radio criticized the BBC and the Voice of America, accusing them of deliberately suppressing the growth of peaceful and democratic forces.

### Eastern European Satellite States Act Independently, Molotov's Plan Fails, Political Disputes Between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia Lead to Economic Warfare

[United Press, Washington, 9th] The United States has learned from behind the Iron Curtain that the Soviet Union's "Molotov Plan," which intended to promote the production of its satellite states, seems to have failed halfway. Poland and Czechoslovakia behind the Iron Curtain organized the "Council for Mutual Economic Assistance" at the beginning of this year, guaranteeing to increase production within the year, with the plan of using the production of the entire region to seek the welfare of the entire region. However, the countries are still acting independently and are not helping each other.

For example, Czechoslovakia dismantled textile machines, while Hungary added new textile factories. Molotov had allowed the satellite states to invest approximately 3 billion yuan in industry, but several countries are establishing the same enterprises, not afraid of future overproduction. After the Soviet Union monopolized the Danube River, shipping plummeted to only one-tenth of what it was when the river was open. The countries along the river also manage navigation independently. Moscow's greatest difficulty seems to be Yugoslavia, Premier Tito, and political accusations by the Kremlin. The South Communist Party's newspaper "Borba" stated that the Moscow Radio's claim that the Soviet Union provided South with 500,000 tons of wheat in 1944 was a lie. In fact, it was only 50,000 tons. The Soviet Union demanded that the South exchange 370 tons of aluminum sand for a Soviet traction line, which was very unfair in price. The Soviet Union also required Yugoslav students in Moscow to pay fees in US dollars, which further depleted the South's foreign exchange. Moscow seems to have stopped transporting industrial machinery to the South and has withdrawn Soviet technicians from the South, which has made Tito the most annoyed. In a speech, Tito pointed out that Moscow intended to suppress the industrialization of the South, and Yugoslavia was unwilling to continue to be a supplier of raw materials. The situation in Romania is also not optimistic. Romania's national industry is managed by eight Romanian joint committees. The Soviet Union has ordered a large number of heavy industrial machines from Romania, but the Romanian Communist government has expressed dissatisfaction. At the same time, Soviet policy observers have discovered that Stalin has long wanted to use the Soviet Union's neighboring countries. Stalin had a book in 1920, "Soviet Policy and National Issues," which stated, "The Soviet center of the world revolution cannot be sustained for a long time without the assistance of neighboring countries rich in raw materials, fuel, and food."

### Burmese Rebels Launch Offensive

The President replied: "I have worked hard all my life and have never done anything that would harm my health, so I am strong." White House doctor Graham said that the President's physique is strong, like an "iron man."

### Amateur Tennis King, Kramer Talks About Tennis Experience

[United Press, London, 8th] Tennis king Kramer announced today that he has been smooth sailing since going professional and can still dominate the professional tennis world for more than three years, maintaining his reputation as a winning army.

He said: "If tennis players can take good care of themselves and improve their courage slightly, they can maintain their momentum until they are 32 years old. But this is very difficult. I must limit drinking beer and forbid drinking whiskey."

Kramer led a team to Europe in March to perform. The team members included Riggs from the United States, Bales from Australia, and Segura from Ecuador. Kramer's usual opponent is Riggs. Since December 1947, Kramer has won eight or nine out of ten games between the two. Therefore, Kramer hopes that new players in the amateur tennis world will join the professional world this year. Kramer believes that among the amateur tennis players this year, there is hope of winning the three major tennis championships (Wimbledon Championship, US Championship, and Davis Cup Championship) for Schroeder and Gonzalez of the United States and Brownweich of Australia. Schroeder is Kramer's old partner. The two have collaborated twice in 1946 and 1947 to win the Davis Cup. Gonzalez is a 20-year-old young player who has won the three major American clay court and indoor tennis championships. Brownweich has been unlucky for many years, but Kramer said: "He has had good luck since coming to the United States this year, or he may be lucky." The other three hopefuls are Vandenberg, the 1948 Wimbledon champion from the United States, Parker, a veteran from Los Angeles, and Quloni, a Czech left-handed player. Kramer criticized Quloni, saying: "Quloni is worthy of being a general, but unfortunately, he lacks stamina and cannot fight three major battles in a week. This kind of encounter must occur in the Wimbledon competition."

Any one of the above six people only needs to win the championship in the amateur tennis world in the next six months, and there will be ready-made opportunities to make a fortune waiting for him. Kramer said: "It is not difficult for me to drag him into the sea. I just need to show him my savings book. In the first year of going professional, I earned 115,000 yuan."

### Another Upset in Group B Table Tennis: Yucai Overwhelms Seeded New Star

Today, Group A Silk White vs. Bank of China

In the 4th Table Tennis League, a shocking upset occurred in Group B, Division Three, the day before yesterday. The seeded team New Star was unexpectedly defeated by Yucai by a lopsided score of 1-4, which was astonishing. The young players of Yucai initially did not expect to win, but unexpectedly, Zhuang Tingfang achieved victory in the first match, which boosted the morale of the other young players. New Star suffered a setback due to the defeat of their star player Gao Shangzhi. The second and third matches were also uncertain, which was unfortunate. The entire team only managed to win back one point through their main player Wang Xiuguang. As a result, Yucai achieved a great victory over New Star with a score of 4-1, which can be considered a remarkable achievement. According to League Secretary Chen Linsheng, the seeded team Ling in Group B, Division One, has already been defeated by the Red and White team. The seeded team China Merchants in Division Two was defeated by Fansheng. This battle witnessed the young players of Yucai overwhelming the seeded New Star in Division Three. It can be said that the younger generation is surpassing the older generation, which is a significant achievement of this league and is worth celebrating. However, it is hoped that the winners will not be arrogant and the losers will not be discouraged, but will strengthen their research on technical deficiencies, improve their standards, and strive to become outstanding talents. The scores of both sides and the results of previous matches are recorded below:

Yucai　Score　New Star

Zhuang Tinghang　21-19 21-19　Gao Shangzhi

Chen Gongbai　21-12 19-21 21-17　Shen Huanzhong

Li Yaogi　21-19 20-22 21-16　Qin Yulian

Gong Jianren　16-21 12-21　Wang Xiuguang

Yao Yunsheng　21-12 21-23 21-16　Li Baoyan

Red and White defeated Zhongji (B1) 3-2

China Agriculture defeated Railway (B2) 3-2

Youlian defeated Post 18 (B2) 3-2

Jianxin defeated Red and White (B1) 3-2

Today (the 10th), there will be one match in Group A and four matches in Group B. In Group A, Silk White will face the Bank of China. The two sides have played four matches each, with equal wins and losses and equal points. Their results are better than the two strong teams Qinglian and Post B. Tonight, they will meet, and they can be called evenly matched opponents. A fierce battle is inevitable. Among the four matches in Group B, only the United team in Division Two is undefeated. In this battle against Tianxiang, they will naturally strive to defend their territory. Tianxiang has the veteran Lin Binru to help, and the team's morale is very high. They are determined to break the United team's winning streak, and a fierce battle is expected. The schedule for today and the list of players for the two teams in Group A are recorded below:

Silk White——Bank of China (Group A) 7:00 PM Silk Industry

Railway——Starfire (B2) 6:00 PM Mental Hospital

### Final Two Matches of the Football League: Railway and Leader Meet This Weekend

The Football Committee announced yesterday the schedule for this week's football league. There will be two matches in Group A on Saturday and Sunday (the 14th and 15th), which will still be played at Yiyuan. China Airlines vs. Zhichao, Leader vs. Railway. This will be the end of this year's league, and the football season will also come to a close. The Football Committee announced that during the Qingbai vs. Zhichao match on the 7th, Zhichao player Zhu Jia-Zheng fell in a rough manner and was given a warning.

In the China Airlines vs. Zhichao match on Saturday, the former won with a score of 1-0 in the first round. Zhichao should seek revenge. However, there is talk of China Airlines forfeiting the match, which remains to be seen.

The battle between Leader and Railway has been problematic in the two matches of the league, which is regrettable. This rematch should not have any more complications. Railway is the champion of the Mayor's Cup, and last week they drew with Qingbai, which shows their strong fighting spirit. Leader's northern style has become a unique style, with bold moves and brilliant performances. When they meet Railway, it is still unknown who will win. This week's program is recorded below:

May 14 (Saturday)

China Airlines——Zhichao (Group A) 4:00 PM Yiyuan

May 15 (Sunday)

Leader——Railway (Group A Rematch) 4:00 PM Yiyuan

### Water, Electricity, Gas, and Telephone Fees Temporarily Paid at 370,000 Times

Do not cut off water and electricity to those who have not paid beyond the time limit

[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Public Utility Bureau has notified various companies to pay water, electricity, gas, and telephone fees in accordance with the decision of the Municipal Council, temporarily based on the salary index of 370,000 times. However, some companies refused to accept payment yesterday. According to Acting Director Gu Zhenbai of the Public Utility Bureau, the notice has been issued, and the companies may not have been fully informed. It is expected that there will be no more refusals to accept payment starting today.

[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council's Public Utility Subcommittee rejected the method of charging fees for the four public utilities of water, electricity, gas, and telephone based on the pricing index and decided to temporarily pay at an index of 370,000 times. However, the public utility companies refused to accept payment because they had not yet received a notice from the municipal government, causing general citizens to feel bewildered. If they temporarily delay payment, they fear that the companies will cut off their water and electricity. For this reason, the reporter specifically consulted Mayor Chen. According to Chen, he immediately notified the Public Utility Bureau to inform the companies that they must not cut off water and electricity to users who have not paid beyond the deadline before a new pricing method is decided. He also said that the primary task of Mr. Liu Xiqi, whom he has appointed as the director of the Public Utility Bureau, is to solve the problem of public utility prices. He has asked Liu to gather experts to study the expenses of each company and determine whether there are any wasteful or unreasonable expenses, and to try to lower their prices as much as possible.

### Grain Storage Committee Allocates 2,000 Metric Tons of Rice for Public Utility Grain Reserve to Ensure Work Is Not Affected by Grain Shortages in Future Emergency Situations

[Our Newspaper] The Emergency Grain Purchase and Storage Committee has recently allocated 2,000 metric tons of rice to the city's public utilities for emergency grain reserves. The storage of this grain will ensure that all public utilities in the city will not be affected by grain shortages in future emergencies (especially the supply of water and electricity).

The allocation of emergency grain storage is based on the resolution of a meeting convened by the US Economic Cooperation Administration on the 1st of this month. The main principles decided at that time were as follows: (1) The US Economic Cooperation Administration and the Grain Storage Committee agreed that, without affecting the principle of household rice rations, the Grain Storage Committee would immediately allocate 2,000 metric tons of rice, specifically for the emergency use of employees and direct dependents of various public utility companies. (2) The amount of emergency reserve rice for employees and direct dependents of the above public utility companies shall be based on 30 jin (2 shi dou) per person, with each employee and their direct dependents calculated as a standard of four people. (3) After the above rice is transported to the location of the company, the company shall be responsible for proper storage and shall not be used until the household rice rations are suspended.

There are a total of 17 public utility institutions preparing emergency grain reserves, with a total of over 115,000 employees and dependents. All of this emergency grain has now been allocated to the Civil Affairs Bureau for receipt and distribution. Although the use of grain storage is stipulated to be at the time when household rice rations are suspended, this provision is only hypothetical. It is hoped that citizens will not misunderstand that it will be suspended soon, because the rations for May and June in the city have been fully raised, and the rations after July are also being actively prepared by the Grain Storage Committee, the US Economic Cooperation Administration, and the local authorities.

### Municipal Government Plans to Investigate Public and Private Materials

[Our Newspaper] Mayor Chen revealed to reporters that the municipal government is actively planning to thoroughly investigate all public and private materials in the city in order to enrich the storage of daily necessities in the city and prevent panic in emergency situations.

Therefore, we will consider improving this method."

### Three Key Criminals for Plotting to Overthrow the Government, Meng Shiheng et al., Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] At the end of last year, military authorities in Nanjing and Shanghai uncovered an organization called the "Kuomintang Reform Committee" in Nanjing and Shanghai that plotted to overthrow the government. They arrested key criminals, including Meng Shiheng, the chairman of the Nanjing branch of the committee, Wu Shiwu, the propaganda committee member of the branch, and Xiao Jiankui, a deserter from the Communications Company of the 7th Regiment of the Military Police. After repeated interrogations by the authorities, they were sentenced to death according to martial law and approved by Commander-in-Chief Tang. They were executed by firing squad at the Song Park execution ground at 3:00 PM yesterday by the police bureau, with Si Daoping, the commander of the garrison police, serving as the execution supervisor. Before the execution, the three criminals sang the national anthem and shouted slogans. According to the police bureau, Meng Shiheng, 44 years old, from Jilin, was the head of the "Kuomintang Reform Committee Nanjing Branch" organized by Li Jishen. Meng was appointed as the director of the branch by Wang Baozhen, a special envoy of the committee in Nanjing and Shanghai.

Six Conspiracies

He led this conspiracy organization in Nanjing, with various departments such as labor movement, youth, public education, and military personnel. He specifically sent people to recruit wavering elements from the party, government, military, police, and constitution, attempting to incite rebellion, conspire to overthrow the government, respond to the communist troops crossing the Yangtze River, and decided on six conspiracies. (1) Control the airport, (2) Cut off transportation trunk lines, (3) Detain key government officials (including Acting President Li, Commander-in-Chief Tang, Director Huang, Mayor Teng, etc.), (4) Establish the People's Liberation Committee, (5) Establish the Nanjing People's Government, (6) Respond to the communist troops crossing the Yangtze River. Wu Shiwu, 36 years old, from Harbin, was appointed as the propaganda committee member of the branch by Meng Shiheng. The announcements posted by the branch in Nanjing were mostly written by him. He once planned to represent Meng Shiheng to meet with the communist army leaders in Jiangbei to discuss plans to cross the Yangtze River. Xiao Jiankui, also known as Xiao Chengyu, 25 years old, from Shenyang, Northeast China, was a private in the Communications Company of the 7th Regiment of the Military Police.

Unexpectedly, the scheme was discovered and arrested. The above criminals were found to be true after interrogation and were sentenced to death.

### Bounced Check Fraudulently Obtains Medicine, Caught by Chance and Arrested

[Our Newspaper] Western medicine merchant Zhang Zhengxiong has an office at 645 Jiujiang Road, buying and selling Western medicines on behalf of customers. Several months ago, Si Zhiyu, a fellow dealer with a familiar face, bought 600 dozen Tiger Balm Yong An Tang Balms and 400 dozen Bagua Dans from him. Si signed an immediate check for 840,000 yuan, but it bounced due to insufficient funds. Afterwards, Zhang urgently searched for him to no avail and reported the case to the police bureau, asking them to investigate and arrest him. He also inquired if any large quantities of Tiger Balm, etc., were being sold on the market. He later learned that a large number of Bagua Dan and Tiger Balm of unknown origin had been found at Liang Yu's place at 2 Lane 423 Jinling East Road. He notified the police bureau to send people to investigate and recover the goods, totaling 200 dozen. According to Liang's confession, it was indeed Si Zhiyu who sent them to repay debts. In addition to ordering him to be released on bail pending trial, the stolen medicines were handed over to Zhang for retrieval first. The police are still continuing to arrest Si and bring him to justice. According to Zhang Zhengxiong, the value of the above goods, calculated at the current market price, is as high as 5 billion gold yuan.

### Decision to Abolish Security Donation, A New Method of Levy Will Be Developed for Subsidizing Troop Provisions

[Our Newspaper] Regarding the issue of abolishing or retaining the security donation in the city, Mayor Chen convened representatives of the industrial sector, such as Liu Hongsheng, for a meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. According to Chen, the total amount obtained from the security donation to date is only 54 billion yuan, which is a very small amount and does not help matters. Moreover, there must be a lot of leakage in the middle. Therefore, Commander-in-Chief Tang advocated abolishing it and not collecting it again. Another method of levy will be developed to replace this donation to make up for the shortage of funds for subsidizing troop provisions.

### Food Rice Supply and Demand are Both Scarce, Early Thin Rice Knocks on the 30 Million Mark in the Southern Market

Yesterday, the rice market slightly rose in the southern market and stabilized in the northern market. Market transactions became increasingly sluggish due to the scarcity of both supply and demand. White japonica early rice and indica rice were both priced at 29.2 million yuan in the southern market, with thin rice knocking on the 30 million mark, an increase of 2 million yuan compared to last Saturday. The prices in the northern market stabilized yesterday because they had risen too much last week.

In the miscellaneous grain market, imports and exports were sporadic, and prices stagnated at last week's original prices. Jiujiang winter beans were priced at 15 million and 14 million yuan, selected green beans opened at 30 million yuan, with only six bags sold. Corn rose slightly by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, red beans were priced at 7 million yuan, mung beans had more transactions, and sesame seeds were not yet open.

Flour prices revolved upwards. The market was ordered to strictly prohibit silver dollar bidding. Merchants were wary and unwilling to let go easily. Therefore, yesterday's transactions were particularly scarce. Soldier ship initially opened at 7 million yuan, the central market rose to 7.5 million yuan, but it was still difficult to buy in. The later market rose again, with bids reaching as high as 8 million yuan. Old car opened at 8 million yuan in the morning, and by noon, the asking price was 8.5 million yuan, bran has not yet opened.

Edible oil stopped falling and rebounded. As rice prices remained firm, people's minds turned up. Retailers took advantage of the low prices to absorb, and the market showed less supply and more demand. Factory soybean oil and factory vegetable oil both opened at 95 million yuan, fresh rapeseed oil was at 72 million yuan, and small car sesame oil was at 75 million yuan. Soybean cake was still not open.

### Gold Market Stabilizes, Jewelry Stores Resume Business Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the gold market was as stable as usual. As the authorities tightened their control over the market, people's hearts softened, and all parties lost interest. Although the rise and stop price tags in the market were still hung up, the general transaction was carried out outside the market. The morning market shouted as high as 250 million, 260 million, but there was no transaction after opening, and immediately fell. It was reported that Da De Cheng sold at 240 million, and the market fell slightly to 210 million, 240 million, and the lowest to 180 million, 210 million. The afternoon closed at 200 million, 230 million. There were few transactions in the afternoon. The initial market was stable, and then it fell slightly to 190 million, 220 million, with little change from the previous day.

The US dollar outside the market still followed gold. The morning opened as high as 4.5 million, 5 million, and as low as 3.7 million, 4.2 million. The afternoon closed at 4 million, 4.5 million, and in the afternoon, it was slightly smaller, closing at 3.8 million, 4.3 million, a reverse decline of 200,000.

[Our Newspaper] The jewelry industry, which has been suspended for many days, has gradually stabilized, and the exchange notes have been clarified. They resumed police business yesterday. The price was 190 million for purchase and 230 million for sale, with transactions in cash and fixed-amount exchange notes. The afternoon price remained unchanged. There is still no market for silver.

The gold market has been expanded to a gold and silver market. According to the person in charge of the market, no official order has been received yet.

### Cigarette Industry Association Calls on the Ministry, Please Withdraw the Order to Adjust the Tax Amount

The Shanghai Cigarette Industry Association believes that the tax amount recently announced by the Goods Tax Bureau is too high and cannot be afforded. Yesterday, it specifically sent a telegram to the Minister of Finance and the Director of the National Taxation Bureau in Guangzhou. The original telegram stated: "Recently, the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau announced that the second phase of the cigarette tax in May will be implemented on May 6. The figure is about five or six times larger than the one announced and implemented in the first phase on May 1. It accounts for about 90% of the current market price of various cigarette brands. Recently, the cigarette industry has been promoting sales, and less than one-tenth of them can maintain production. The factory workers have been demanding payment, and the response to the environment has been increasing day by day. The factories are short of cash, and many of them use existing cigarettes to pay the workers. The actual market price has decreased from May 1 to May 5. This shows that the cigarette factory's business has become very state. Even if the tax amount is not adjusted, it is already extremely difficult, and it is already difficult to survive. After this adjustment, the average tax revenue of each cigarette brand accounts for more than 90% of the cigarette's market price. If the manufacturers want to purchase taxes and sell cigarettes, their income will only offset the taxes, which is equivalent to giving away cigarettes. It is no different from accelerating the collapse of the cigarette industry. In addition to presenting the case to the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau, we sent a special express telegram, hoping that you will take into account the reality, and immediately inform the Shanghai Bureau to immediately restore the original tax amount of May 1. Please withdraw the order to adjust the tax amount every five days and settle the tax payment every three days, so that the cigarette industry can be slightly postponed."

### Shanghai Grain, Fuel Oil, and Cotton: Economic Cooperation Administration Decides to Maintain Regular Supply

[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Government recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangzhou, forwarded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai, stating that Mr. Lapham, Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration's China Branch, informed the Ministry that the ECA has decided to maintain a regular supply of 300,000 dan of grain per month, as well as other fuel oil and cotton, to Shanghai. However, if there is an urgent need for an increase in the above-mentioned allocation, Mayor Chen and the American Aid Utilization Committee can negotiate with them to increase the amount. It is also learned that the municipal authorities and Taiwan are actively proceeding with the exchange of cloth for coal and grain, and it is estimated that approximately 70,000 tons of coal can be obtained each month. The edible oil exchange method has also been agreed upon.

### Scarce Silver Dollar Transactions: Prices of Various Versions Gradually Equalize; Nickel Coin Market Weak

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the silver dollar market showed signs of weakness. Due to the authorities' repeated emphasis on punishing those who violate regulations for disrupting the financial system, and after the execution of five silver dollar dealers on Saturday, many were discouraged from exchanging different versions. Half of the businesses stopped trading, while the other half quoted 3.8 million for buying and 4 million for selling. Eagle foreign dollars were available for purchase, but when asked about "small heads" (smaller denomination silver dollars), they replied that they were not being collected. The market price weakened further, and the situation improved in the afternoon. By evening, "small heads" and "junk dollars" were being sold by everyone at 4 million, and it is expected that the prices of various versions will equalize on their own.

Gold and silver exchanges maintained their style yesterday. There was a great deal of anxiety in the "big building" (referring to financial institutions), and no firm dared to exchange versions, but the price drop has already started to even out. In the morning, they were buying at 42 yuan and selling at 47 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose to 43 and 48. Some even did as high as 45 and 50, but that was a minority. The afternoon was calm, still doing 43 and 48, and there was no distinction between factory bars and bank bars.

Gold-paper money exchanges and paper money-silver exchanges were completely suspended by general businesses yesterday. "Scalpers" operating in a guerrilla style in the corridors of the "big building" were still active. The gold (one tael)-paper money exchange was 50 yuan for buying and 52 yuan for selling. The paper money (ten yuan)-silver exchange was 8.5 yuan for buying and 9.5 yuan for selling, regardless of the version. Gold ornaments exchanged for silver dollars on the street were done at 43 and 47.

[Our Newspaper] The nickel coin market was initially stable but then weakened. Due to the Garrison Command's order prohibiting the raising of silver dollar prices, people's confidence was weak, causing the market to remain at its original level. In the morning, 20-fen coins were bought at 160,000 and sold at 190,000. 10-fen coins were bought at 80,000 and sold at 100,000. 5-fen coins were bought at 30,000 and sold at 50,000. In the afternoon, 20-fen coins dropped to 140,000 and 180,000, 10-fen coins dropped to 70,000 and 90,000, and 5-fen coins dropped to 20,000 and 40,000, all down 20,000 from the previous day.

### Cotton Cloth: Officially Rising, Actually Falling

Cotton cloth trading in the market has returned to normal. Yesterday, quoted prices officially increased but actually decreased. The market was initially absorbed by the South China traders, but then weakened in the afternoon. It was said that there was a shortage of South China ships, making loading difficult. Traders then resold, causing a slight rebound. "Dragon Head" fine cloth rose from 16.8 million to 17.5 million, finally closing at 17 million. "Dragon Head B" fine cloth initially opened at 14.6 million. The highest price reached 16 million, but retreated to 15.4 million at noon. "Double Dragon" fine cloth saw a lot of transactions, rising from 14.4 million to 14.6 million. "Three Peach" fine cloth was traded at 14.8 million, and "Four Gentlemen" serge reached a high of 18 million, finally closing at 17.4 million. The prices from the People's Police Factory remained largely unchanged.

### Cotton Yarn Market: Flat and Weak

The cotton yarn market was weak yesterday due to the low price of gold outside the circle, resulting in very weak buying interest. 42-count "Blue Phoenix" was traded at 820,000, a decrease of 80,000 from last week. 40-count "Golden City" was 760,000, also a decrease of 70,000. 32-count "Silver Moon" was 610,000, a slight decrease of 60,000. 21-count "Double Horse" single-ply had more supply than demand, resulting in weak interest. The spot price was 535,000, all down from last Saturday. 20-count, 16-count, and 10-count were all mediocre.

### Brief News from Guiyang

— Our Reporter Liu Mengchi

[Our Newspaper Guiyang, 29th by Airmail] Recently, all industries in Guiyang have gradually adopted the silver dollar as the base currency. This Monday (the 25th), movie theaters changed the price of balcony seats from 5,000 gold yuan to 1.5 silver dollars, and the price of orchestra seats from 3,500 gold yuan to 1 silver dollar, charging in gold yuan converted at the current silver dollar price. A ticket that used to cost 5,000 yuan suddenly became more than 50,000 yuan, even more than 70,000 yuan. In movie entertainment venues where people living on salaries are the main audience, the business situation is naturally dismal. Yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock, the Qunxin Cinema encountered a funny and yet depressing incident. The second show had already started more than a quarter of an hour ago, but only three balcony seats and four orchestra seats had been sold, all to soldiers and students. If a show were played for these seven people, the cinema would lose too much money, so they politely asked them to change their tickets to the next show, but these seven people firmly refused to change their tickets and insisted on watching the show immediately. The staff of the cinema politely expressed their willingness to refund the tickets, even offering to double the refund, but these seven people still firmly refused. Finally, the public relations manager of the cinema came forward to apologize, explained the difficulties, and invited them to a big meal at a nearby restaurant, doubling the refund for each of them, finally ending this farce caused by changing to silver dollar pricing that exceeded the people's ability to pay.

[Also Reported] The prices of newspaper publishing and advertising in Guiyang are so high that they are probably among the highest in major cities in the country. Before April 20, a full-size daily newspaper was priced at 1,600 gold yuan per copy, a quarter-size evening newspaper at 800 yuan, and advertising was priced at only 1,600 yuan per inch. On the 20th, all evening newspapers complied with the agreement of the Newspaper Association and changed to using the silver dollar as the base currency, with full-size daily newspapers priced at 1 silver dollar per copy, quarter-size evening newspapers at 5 cents, and advertising at 30 cents per inch, converted to gold yuan at the silver dollar price at 9 PM the day before publication. The price of a newspaper on the 19th was only 1,600 yuan, but the next day it suddenly jumped to 8,500 yuan. From then on, the silver dollar price rose every day, and the newspaper price also rose every day, reaching a maximum of 39,000 yuan per copy. Unfortunately, the newspaper vendors in Guiyang also have a bad practice of wholesaling at 60-70% of the list price and then reselling at 10-20% above the list price. In other words, in the past two days when the silver dollar price reached a peak of 490,000, people in Guiyang had to spend 60,000 gold yuan to buy a daily newspaper to read, which is shocking in a small border city where industry and commerce are not developed! In the past ten days, daily and evening newspapers have greatly felt the pain of "currency reform." Subscribers have been canceling subscriptions, retail sales have been decreasing day by day, and advertising has been almost entirely limited to weddings, engagements, and pleasure-seeking, with virtually no new customers coming in. The people in charge are always sighing and feeling that they are suffering the consequences of their own actions.

The Central Daily News, Guizhou Daily News, and Guizhou Commercial Daily News have recently been planning to automatically reduce the silver dollar base price of publishing under the pretext of "reducing the burden on readers" and are preparing to offer large discounts on advertising rates to overcome the difficulties. The Small Spring and Autumn, New World, and Mingdao Evening News have an even better idea: from May 1, they will change to a rotating publishing method, that is, doing the business of "working one day and eating for three days," changing from daily publishing to tri-daily publishing, thereby saving a lot of expenses. Each day, one evening newspaper will do the business of selling "exclusive" items, and each newspaper can also lay off many employees. The Youth News Evening Post boldly suspended publication for two days, standing on the "Yellow Crane Tower" to see how the others fared across the river before making a decision. They believe that not changing to silver dollars is impossible, and changing to silver dollars is still impossible. The only way out is probably to close down.

### The Third World War is a "Political Germ Warfare"

— Zeng Xubai

Will the Third World War happen? If so, when will it happen? How will it happen? These are questions that everyone is concerned about today. Many opinions have been published by commentators at home and abroad, and I would like to add some opinions that have not yet been noticed.

To discuss the world war, we must first establish a definition for the term "war." Generally speaking, armed conflict is war. However, modern political struggles can achieve the effects of war without bloodshed. If the definition of war is limited to the former, I dare say that a world war initiated by the Soviet Union is not only unlikely to happen in ten or fifty years, but will never happen. If the definition of war is expanded to include the latter, then the Third World War has already begun before the end of the Second World War and is now actively expanding.

When I say a world war initiated by the Soviet Union, some may ask, "Is it certain that the future world war will be initiated by the Soviet Union?" I say this is inevitable because, judging from the current state of confrontation between socialism and capitalism, capitalist countries are clearly taking a defensive stance, aiming to secure their vested interests and maintain the status quo of their social order. Socialist countries, on the other hand, aim to achieve a world socialist revolution and are taking an offensive stance, naturally being the initiators of war. Assuming that we can determine that this proactive country will not adopt the form of war to attack, we can infer and determine that the future war of socialist revolution will never involve armed conflict.

Anyone who understands or has personally experienced the political tactics of communists knows that the Communist Party uses organizing the masses, grasping the masses, and using the masses as capital for their struggles. They are always the directors behind the scenes and never personally appear on stage. Their specialty is to disperse cadres among the masses, organize cells, and then use the power of many cells to dismantle the inherent organizations of society and rebuild their ideal new organizations. They have village cadres and township cadres to direct the performances on the stage of village and township congresses, and they have peasant cadres and worker cadres to manipulate the resolutions in the venues of peasant and worker organizations. They exclude or punish the current regime as well as landlords and capitalists, never exposing the political power they have gained to exert rigid oppression, but instead use democratic mass meetings for liquidation and struggle. This set of tricks is already familiar to the Chinese people today.

However, this set of political maneuvering tactics is not a secret unique to the CCP, but a fixed formula under the communist dogma for seizing political power. In every village and town in the CCP-occupied areas, we see the widespread application of this formula. In countries behind the communist Iron Curtain, such as Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, etc., there is not a single place that has not used this method to seize political power. Although the application of techniques varies somewhat from country to country due to differences in the environment, the basic method remains unchanged.

This infiltration tactic is political germ warfare. In the eyes of the Communist Party, its power is far greater than that of airplanes and artillery. They believe that this tactic can render atomic bombs useless because the germs they spread penetrate into every cell of a country's social organization. Who can distinguish which cell contains these germs? Even if they are identified, thousands upon thousands of cells mixed together make it impossible to find the object of destruction.

This tactic is fundamentally a political atomic bomb. Because the role of the atomic bomb is to shatter the organization of material cells, while this tactic is to shatter the organization of political cells. This is how communists think.

Therefore, they will never rely on airplanes, artillery, and atomic bombs, which they know they cannot match, to expand their political sphere of influence. Instead, they will try their best to use their political atomic bombs, which they are confident they have a firm grasp on, to achieve their social revolution. In other words, they will never engage in war with capitalist countries through armed conflict. Therefore, I say that wars of this nature will never happen.

Some may say, "Wasn't the Soviet Union one of the Allied countries in World War II, and one of the countries that suffered the most? They could participate in one war, so why not initiate another war?" This consideration is indeed meaningful because it can further infer the motivation of the Soviet Union's current military preparations.

When we study the course of World War II, seeing how the Soviet Union joined the Allied camp with hesitation and ambition, and how the results of the war revealed the heavy sacrifices it suffered due to the imperfection of various war conditions, we can understand that the Soviet Union cannot fight tough battles. Its communist rulers also know that it cannot shoulder the heavy burden of fighting. Its participation in the war was a last resort. If it had not stepped forward, the Nazi railways would have destroyed the podium from which the Third International issued orders, and the foundation of the social revolution would have been fundamentally eradicated. It had to take advantage of the ignorance of the capitalist countries and join their camp to preserve its existing political capital. It was forced to fight a tough battle, and fighting a tough battle would inevitably result in heavy sacrifices. The Communist Party knew this but could not avoid it, which is their unspeakable tragedy.

Today, the Soviet Union's lack of war preparedness is even greater than before its participation in World War II. This has already been repeatedly revealed by British and American reporters, and I need not elaborate further. I only wish to expose the errors in the final conclusions of some British and American reporters: they believe that the Soviet Union is now devoting itself to the expansion of military equipment, hoping to surpass the military strength of capitalist countries after the completion of the scheduled plan, and then fight a decisive battle with the United States and Britain on the battlefield. They do not know that the Soviet Union's military preparations, in military terms, are entirely defensive. In fact, its offensive has already begun. In the self-deceiving compromise and expectation of capitalist countries, it has broken through countless lines of defense and entered the heart of capitalist countries.

Judging from the current situation to infer the future, it is not difficult for us to imagine the outline of the expansion of communist forces. The attack of germs must first target bodies with weak resistance. The communists have even more grasped the weakness of capitalist countries, that even the physically strong countries rely on the support of a large group of weak masses to maintain their health. If the communists can disintegrate this group of weaklings, the group of stronglings will lose its support, become weak, and become easy targets for germs. First disintegrate the weak and then the strong, and the task of the socialist revolution will be accomplished. Observing the changes in the Near East and the expansion of communist forces in the Far East, we dare say that this inference is correct. The fortresses of capitalism are the United States and Britain. Assuming that the colonies and dominions of the British Empire are first eroded by germs and collapse, the British Isles may be hard to preserve as the only remaining fruit. Assuming that the South American countries all become red and the Far Eastern market is covered by an Iron Curtain, it will be difficult for the United States to become a gold-dollar kingdom.

Therefore, we can assume that there will be no more international wars like the First and Second World Wars. Some countries will experience civil wars like China, and some countries will experience constant political turmoil. On the surface, it is a struggle between the left and right factions within each country, but in reality, the so-called left in each country has unity and a large military and political group directing from behind the scenes, while the so-called right is an unorganized and aimless mess.

Assuming that this inference is correct, and then looking at the recent measures of capitalist countries, such as the conclusion of the Atlantic Security Treaty, etc., which are actively defending in military terms, I am afraid that the leaders in the Kremlin are secretly laughing. They will laugh at these politicians who are setting up sentries on the front lines, and one day they will wake up to find that their old nest has been taken over by someone else.

The disease caused by the political germ warfare of the communists is an internal disease of cell disintegration, but capitalist countries want to cure this disease by adopting an external surgical operation, which is truly prescribing the wrong medicine for a desperate disease.

Internal diseases should be treated with internal medicine. If germs want to break your cells, you should strengthen your cells. If germs want to take advantage of your weakness, you should support your origins. The world is an interconnected economic system, and there is a life-and-death, common-fortune relationship between countries and nations. Therefore, we should be even more vigilant that the disintegration of the weak is the death knell for the strong. Helping the weak around the world who are susceptible to germs and making them strong is the only correct struggle policy to ensure that you will not be attacked by germs in the future. All the human and material resources that are currently actively preparing for war should be shifted to this aspect.

### The Renowned Horses of Yanqi in Xinjiang: Silent Warriors

— Li Songze

[Dispatch from Dihua, 2nd (by airmail)] "Alfalfa follows the Heavenly Horses." In fact, the Yanqi horses of the ancient Western Regions were comparable to the Heavenly Horses. The Yanqi Uyghurs call it "Black City," but these "Silent Warriors" of "Black City" (as General Tao Zhiyue, Commander of the Xinjiang Provincial Garrison, called them) are still raised by the nomadic Mongols.

Originally, Xinjiang, including areas like Yili, Tacheng, Zhenxi, and Yanqi, were all horse-producing regions. If we compare them in terms of height, build, endurance, and ability to thrive on coarse feed, the horses from Yili and Yanqi are the best. Now that Yili is still a "special zone," Yanqi has become Xinjiang's only horse depot today.

Yanqi horses are not exclusively produced in Yanqi. Within the Yanqi administrative region, which includes eight counties—Yanqi, Heshuo, Hejing, Luntai, Weili, Ruoqiang, Qiemo, and Korla—horses are produced in all of them, but those from Yanqi, Heshuo, and Hejing are considered the best. East of the Qingshui River, south of the Kaidu River, extending to Bosten Lake, is Heshuo, which locals call "Heshuo horses" or "Heshuo families." Conversely, those extending into the Tianshan Mountains are "Hejing," which locals call "Hejing horses" or "Great Mountain horses." Yanqi County is situated in between geographically, essentially being divided, so the people of Yanqi don't call them "Yanqi horses."

Since "Yanqi horses" is a general term for those from Yanqi, Heshuo, and Hejing counties, their distribution is naturally on the lush grasslands in different corners of these three counties. Those on the plains are found in Quhui, the Qingshui River, the Taoniaojia River, Niaoshitala, Niaolachahan, the lower reaches of the Kaidu River, and near the shores of Bosten Lake. Those in the Tianshan Mountains are found in Halun Gully, Ala Gully, Baluntai, Eastern Tashkent, Nayurile, Shahatke, Cao Hanchacha, Kailigute, Niuchigeng Tashkhan, and the greater and lesser Yuludusi areas. The climate in the Tianshan Mountains is extremely cold in winter, and the grass withers, but in summer, the grass is lush and green, and the weather is exceptionally cool. The plains are very hot and have many mosquitoes in summer, but in winter, they are warm, and the water and grass can sustain nomads. Therefore, nomads distinguish between "summer camps" and "winter camps."

If we consider ourselves the "Boles" (expert horse judges) of today and differentiate them scientifically, Heshuo horses are inferior to Hejing horses, and among Hejing horses, the Great Mountain horses are inferior to those from outside the mountains. Compared to the commonly referred to Yanqi horses, they are even more inferior.

Generally, the body of a Yanqi horse is symmetrical in all its parts: the head is square, the ears are short, the nostrils are large, the lips are thin, the head is moderately long, the back is broad and long, the croup slopes gently, the chest and knees are broad, the fetlocks are relatively abundant, and there are very few club feet or hoof deformities. The posture is very handsome, and there are few mixed colors. The most common colors are yellow, black, black chestnut, red chestnut, and red date. The length and thickness of the hair are also moderate. The average height is above 136 centimeters. Their gait is mostly "lateral couplet," and "diagonal couplet" and "mili xi" together only account for half of all horses. Their temperament is more "blood type" than "lymphatic type," nervous temperament is "less than three percent," and their nature is gentle and their movements are agile. As for endurance, climbing ability, and the ability to thrive on coarse feed and withstand cold and exposure, horses from other places cannot compare.

Among the horse herds in the Hejing area of Yanqi, especially the Great Mountain horses, the overall quality is almost twice as good as that of horses produced in Hetou. The most obvious difference is that the coat color of Hetou horses is impure, and the hair is coarse, thick, and long, with a body length slightly lower by two or three centimeters. However, longevity, climbing ability, and the sturdiness of joints and hooves are unique characteristics of Hetou horses.

The ownership of these horse herds is mostly in the hands of the Mongols. For the Mongols, horses can be said to replace their legs. The Mongols' wealth, the horse herds, are the main part of the calculation, so it can also be said that horses are the Mongols' lifeline. We recall that Genghis Khan was able to dominate Eurasia and realize his so-called "I will make those who are now living in tents higher than all the nations of the world" ambitious words because of horses. Therefore, traditionally speaking, reasonably speaking, Mongol compatriots should cherish and improve horses. But what is the reality? The number of Yanqi horses is decreasing day by day. In 1939, the Soviet Union purchased over 30,000 of them at high prices in Yanqi. When Ma Zhongying withdrew from Xinjiang, he robbed over 4,000 horses in the Yanqi area. After the Yili Incident, about 20,000 horses grazing in the Tianshan Mountains were detained by the Yili side. As for the Yanqi horses purchased by local soldiers and civilians over the years, the number is even uncountable. The current combined estimate is only over 20,000, which is a very small proportion of the 900,000 horses in Xinjiang. Moreover, the number produced each year cannot even compensate for the number consumed each year. In another twenty or thirty years, even if they do not become extinct, the so-called renowned horses of Yanqi may only be in name. This is just looking at the quantity. In terms of quality, the Mongols cannot promote their traditional animal husbandry experience to improve breeds. On the contrary, they pay little attention to the selection of breeding partners, almost completely allowing horses to mate and reproduce freely, so their defects and losses are increasing. In addition, riding them before their teeth are fully developed, and innate deficiencies and acquired maladjustments, the body size is decreasing day by day. Ten years ago, the average height was 146 centimeters, now it is only about 136 centimeters. Plus, being left on the grasslands every day, year after year, some die of illness (mostly glanders and epidemics), some are ridden to death, some freeze to death, some die of heat, some drown, some fall to their death, some foals are bitten to death by wolves, and some foals are trampled to death by horses. All of these are due to the failure to prevent natural disasters, treat diseases, and acclimatize them to the environment, resulting in enormous losses, so both the quality and quantity of Yanqi horses are decreasing day by day. Although the Mongols have grown up on horseback, they know nothing about assisting horses other than secure riding. As for riding posture, there is even less to talk about. At the same time, they are not very particular about saddles and tack, which are all ragged and broken. In recent years, I have rarely seen them riding properly or riding a handsome, tall horse. Most are old, thin nags covered in mud and dung!

Finally, I would like to quote a few words from Zuo Shuping, the grandson of Zuo Zongtang and the administrative commissioner of the Yanqi District, as a concluding remark: "Yanqi is a world-renowned horse-producing place. I hope the people of Yanqi will be world-renowned horse lovers!"

### Legal Q&A

Answered by Lawyer Tang Mingshi

[Mr. Huang Zihe asks:] (1) Regarding the gift of real estate to the eldest son and eldest grandson in the grandfather's written will, can it be considered separate property according to law? (2) If this separate property is sold or gifted away by the legal representative without the consent of the parties involved and not for the benefit of the children, can it be considered invalid? (3) Due to abuse by the stepmother, the child has early-stage tuberculosis, and the stepmother controls the family's finances and refuses treatment. In this situation, is it considered unreasonable to ask the family to allow the child to become independent and provide financial assistance?

[Answer:] (1) If the gift procedures are complete, it should comply with the provisions of Article 1087 of the Civil Code. (2) According to Article 1088 of the Civil Code, the legal representative shall not dispose of it unless it is for the benefit of the children. Any violation of this provision is of course invalid. (3) Medical treatment is a condition that meets "for the benefit of the children." The legal representative should make arrangements for payment, and the children can also designate separate property to request payment of medical expenses. However, it is not necessary to go as far as "requesting independence" and other irrelevant issues.
