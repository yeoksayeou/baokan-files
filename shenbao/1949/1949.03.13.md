### Voting Results in the Legislative Yuan: He Yingqin Approved as Premier, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhizhong, etc. Return to the Capital

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] The Legislative Yuan successfully passed the motion to approve He Yingqin's succession as Premier of the Executive Yuan during a 75-minute meeting on the afternoon of the 12th. Among the 240 members of the Legislative Yuan who participated in the vote, only 30 voted against. He Yingqin obtained approval from the Legislative Yuan with a majority of 209 votes, with only one invalid ballot. Acting President Li nominated He Yingqin as Premier of the Executive Yuan, and the official letter requesting the Legislative Yuan's approval was delivered to the Legislative Yuan at 9:00 AM on the 12th by a special envoy. At 11:00 AM, Acting President Li hosted a tea party to explain his intentions to all members of the Legislative Yuan, and most legislators expressed their agreement. At 3:35 PM, the Legislative Yuan held its first temporary meeting of the third session to exercise the right of consent. President Tong Guanxian presided over the meeting, read the presidential letter, and then changed the meeting into a plenary review meeting, with Tong Guanxian still serving as chairman. Many members requested to speak. After expressing his agreement, Liang Dong hoped that the new cabinet would carefully select true talent and that the new cabinet members should have a democratic style, a determination to reform, and be thorough in implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood. He also hoped that He Yingqin would have a policy direction that conforms to the Principle of People's Livelihood and Democracy in the future. Pan Lianfang believed that in extraordinary times, extraordinary measures should be taken to complete extraordinary tasks. He hoped to abolish personnel relations and idolatry, unite to endure hardship, and reform politics. The assembly believed that the speeches at this time should state the reasons for agreeing or disagreeing, and it was inappropriate to discuss the personnel and policies of the new cabinet. Therefore, it was decided to stop the discussion and reopen the plenary session for voting. Lou Yiwen and 14 others were elected as supervisory committee members. Voting began at 4:10 PM and ended at 4:35 PM. Ballots were counted on the spot, and at 4:50 PM, President Tong announced the voting results. He Yingqin received a total of 209 votes of approval, and the meeting adjourned immediately.

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 12th] After celebrating their sixtieth birthday in Hangzhou today, He Yingqin and his wife are scheduled to return to Nanjing tomorrow on the Zhuiyun, a special plane dispatched by Acting President Li, to officially begin forming the cabinet. He Yingqin reported his travel schedule to Acting President Li via long-distance telephone at 9:30 PM tonight. He Yingqin's entourage and relatives are scheduled to return to Nanjing on a special train at 10:30 AM on the 14th.

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 12th] Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Zhongxin, Gu Zhutong, and Wei Yongcheng departed from Jianqiao Airport at 11:40 AM this morning on the Meiling special plane to return to Nanjing to report for duty.

### Speculation on Vice Premier Candidates: Gu Mengyu, Huang Shaohong, Shao Lizi, and Zhang Zhizhong Among Them, Major Changes Possible for Department Heads

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] After Acting President Li's nomination of He Yingqin as the successor to the Premier of the Executive Yuan was approved by the Legislative Yuan by vote on the afternoon of the 12th, people in political circles here reacted very positively. They all believed that He Yingqin was the most suitable candidate for Premier in the current situation. The absolute majority agreement in the Legislative Yuan can also be seen as a symbol of the expected cooperation between the Legislative and Executive branches in the future. They all wish to see the formation of He Yingqin's new cabinet as soon as possible. Regarding the candidates for Vice Premier and heads of various departments, they became the object of speculation from all parties on the 12th. In addition to Gu Mengyu and Huang Shaohong, Shao Lizi and Zhang Zhizhong were also rumored to be candidates for Vice Premier. As for the heads of various departments, it is generally believed that there will be many changes, and only a few people are expected to remain in their positions. However, it is generally believed that Shao Lizi has a high probability of joining the cabinet. A political figure told reporters on the evening of the 12th: The Executive Yuan is a responsible cabinet, and the heads of various departments are responsible to the Premier. When He Yingqin agreed to serve as Premier, he also expressed his advocacy for truly establishing a responsible cabinet system. Acting President Li also expressed his agreement with this view. Therefore, the candidates for Vice Premier and heads of various departments under He Yingqin must be considered by He Yingqin. Even the candidates recommended by Acting President Li must first be discussed with He Yingqin. The person revealed that some of the candidates for the heads of departments had the opportunity to indirectly exchange opinions between Acting President Li and He Yingqin himself when He Yingqin agreed to form the cabinet. There was no excessive discrepancy between the two sides. Once He Yingqin returns to Nanjing from Hangzhou to ask for instructions from Acting President Li, a final decision can be made.

### Acting President Li Hosts Tea Party for Legislators

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] Acting President Li hosted a tea party at the International Friendship Club at noon on the 12th to entertain more than 300 legislators in Nanjing. When he announced that he had invited He Yingqin to serve as Premier of the Executive Yuan and that he would come to Nanjing on the 13th, the entire audience responded with warm applause, which was well received. Acting President Li, accompanied by Chief of Staff Li Hanhun and Adjutant Li Yuqing, first expressed his admiration for the legislators' demands for unity, democracy, and progress. He then explained Sun Ke's firm resignation and retirement, as well as the process of entrusting He Yingqin to form a new cabinet. He said that the most important tasks of the new cabinet were to reorganize the army, reform politics, and strive for peace. He also said that He Yingqin was the most suitable candidate to complete these three tasks. He believed that He Yingqin would respect the Legislative Yuan in the performance of his duties and hoped that the legislators would support him. Finally, he expressed his emotion and gratitude for the legislators' perseverance in coming to Nanjing to attend the meeting despite their hard work and dangers. After the speech, legislator Yang Gongda hoped that the new cabinet would respect the legislature. Zheng Zhenyu said that the most important task at present should be army reorganization and hoped that He Yingqin would thoroughly implement the purpose of army reorganization and pay attention to the selection of the heads of the new cabinet to share the Premier's burden and be responsible for success. Niu Jianchu hoped that the new cabinet could be formed quickly within five days and that it would contact local people more in the future to understand the people's suffering. Zou Shuwen asked the new cabinet to pay attention to the people's livelihood so that the people could live and work in peace and should clearly define responsibilities and powers to facilitate the implementation of government affairs. Finally, Tong Guanxian delivered a reply on behalf of all the legislators, expressing satisfaction with Acting President Li's invitation to He Yingqin to form the cabinet, and hoped that He Yingqin would move forward based on the three major goals of seeking peace, seeking progress, and seeking unity.

### He Yingqin and Wife Celebrate 60th Birthday

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 12th] Today is the sixtieth birthday of General He Yingqin and his wife, Ms. Wang Wenxiang. The Tang Mansion was filled with distinguished guests, and important central officials came to congratulate them. On the eve of He Yingqin's formation of the new cabinet, President Chiang specially wrote the eight characters "Sharing Peace and Danger, Tasting Bitterness Together" as a blessing. Acting President Li, Gu Zhutong, Bai Chongxi. Wu Zhongxin, Zhang Zhizhong, Gu Zhenggang, Tang Enbo, Chen Liang, Zhou Zhirou, and others all sent birthday banners. The layout of the auditorium was simple. In addition to the heads of various departments in Hangzhou, Zhou Zhirou, Lei Zhen, Gu Zhenggang, Tang Enbo, Chen Xigang, and others all came to Hangzhou by special plane to celebrate their birthdays and returned to Nanjing by the original plane at 4:00 PM that afternoon.

Tang Enbo and others held a banquet at noon, and Zhou and Zhang Qiang held a banquet in the evening.

### Peace Talks Postponed Due to Cabinet Reorganization

[French News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] When interviewed by a reporter from the French News Agency today, Acting President Li declared: He has great confidence in restoring peace. Acting President Li stressed: The political situation is very good, and the hope of peace is also very high. He said that He Yingqin's cabinet will benefit the unity within the Kuomintang camp. He also said that the members of He's cabinet will stay in Nanjing for a long time in the future, while the subordinate organs of the Executive Yuan will still stay in Guangzhou. Acting President Li refused to comment on US aid.

[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] The CCP is currently trying to find the greatest propaganda value in the downfall of Sun Ke's cabinet. The Communist Party believes that Sun Ke's resignation is the "failure" of its "Glorious Peace" movement and links this matter with the topic of US interference in China's internal affairs. The Communist Party radio said that US Ambassador Stuart Leiden and four military attachés met with Bai Chongxi to send representatives to Washington to "establish direct contact with military personnel." The current situation is that before the new Executive Yuan is in place, no action can be taken on formally complying with the Communist Party's conditions, and the hope of conducting actual negotiations on March 15 has now disappeared. Even if Li Zongren can immediately have a new cabinet, the new cabinet will have to re-examine the steps already taken at the beginning. In addition to the consistent attacks on the Nanjing government, the Communist Party radio also reports daily on the stories of the Communist Party's efforts to make women, students, workers, and businessmen comply with the Communist Party, and almost every broadcast has a lengthy description of mass rallies and parades. Analysts who pay close attention to the Communist Party's broadcasts believe that the importance of this matter is that it reveals the Communist Party's efforts to gain the support of the people in their occupied areas.

### Liu Luyin Arrives in Beijing, Denies Joining the Cabinet

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] Liu Luyin flew from Chengdu to Beijing on the 11th and visited Acting President Li Kun that night. It was rumored that Liu might join He Yingqin's new cabinet. Reporters interviewed Liu on the evening of the 12th. According to his statement: He will convey the opinions of the people as an opposition figure. Regarding joining the cabinet, he repeatedly stated that there was no such thing. Liu then strongly emphasized the nationwide people's desire for peace and the importance of peace today, and believed that if open and honest discussions can be carried out, peace will eventually be hopeful. Also, Liu's trip was in response to Acting President Li's call for inquiries and will visit old friends who have been separated for more than ten years and stay in Beijing for a while. Liu's demeanor was graceful, his conversation was humble, and he showed a slight sense of distance from today's political affairs.

### He Yingqin Announces Commitment Goals: Establish Political Institutionalization, Seek Peace in Accordance with People's Needs, KMT Central Standing Committee and Political Committee Support He's Cabinet Formation

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 12th] It is reported that He's principle for the selection of the heads of the new cabinet is "using new people and implementing new policies." He will start using some new people to reform China's revolving-door style of politics. On the 12th, reporters from this newspaper visited He Yingqin. He said that the new cabinet's mission is to first meet the needs of the people, seek peace, and devote itself to reforming politics, reorganizing the army, and rectifying the current economic situation. He also accepted the suggestions of local people in Zhejiang Province and will increase the food expenses for soldiers in the future.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] After He Yingqin was ordered to form a cabinet, he decided to make the establishment of political institutionalization and strive to truly achieve the responsible cabinet system as the goal of his efforts. This goal has been unanimously supported by Acting President Li and the central officials, who believe that it is as important as the policies of unity, peace, and reform. He's goal of this effort was reported by Zhang Zhizhong at a banquet held by Acting President Li for the KMT Central Standing Committee members in Nanjing after returning to Nanjing from Hangzhou on the 12th. Zhang said: When he persuaded He Yingqin to form the cabinet in Hangzhou, He Yingqin specifically pointed out that the shortcomings of past politics were that political institutionalization had not been established, powers and responsibilities were unclear, and duties were not separated. He hoped that institutionalization could be established in the future, a responsible cabinet system would be implemented, and a layered responsibility system would be adopted. After Zhang's report, the members spoke and expressed their support for this point. Acting President Li also said that he nominated Mr. He as Premier of the Executive Yuan because he completely trusted Mr. He and decided to enable Mr. He to achieve the responsible cabinet system in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. At noon on the 12th, Acting President Li hosted a banquet for the KMT Central Standing Committee members and the Political Committee members in Nanjing. He first reported that Sun Ke's resignation had been approved and that he had nominated He Yingqin as Premier of the Executive Yuan. According to the Constitution, the President's nomination of the Premier of the Executive Yuan is a power granted by the Constitution, but in accordance with the political parties and the KMT's practice, it should first be submitted to the Central Standing Committee for approval. However, since the Central Party Headquarters has moved to Guangzhou, the Central Standing Committee cannot be held. As an expedient measure, in addition to having telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters in Guangzhou on the morning of the 12th to request the completion of the approval procedures, he specially invited the Central Standing Committee members to solicit opinions this afternoon, hoping to give their consent. Subsequently, Wu Zhongxin and Zhang Zhizhong, who had just returned to Beijing from Hangzhou, reported on the process of persuading He Yingqin to form a cabinet in Hangzhou with Bai Chongxi and Gu Zhutong. According to Wu and Zhang, He Yingqin repeatedly declined, saying that the current situation was difficult and the financial and economic difficulties were heavy, and he was deeply afraid that he would not be able to do the job. However, after being held accountable by the four on the grounds of righteousness, Bai Chongxi also expressed to He Yingqin that under the current circumstances, only He could bear this important task, and all parties absolutely unanimously supported He. Finally, He reluctantly agreed to do his best. After Wu and Zhang finished their reports, the members stood up and spoke, unanimously agreeing that He should take office as Premier of the Executive Yuan and accept Acting President Li's nomination. They also unanimously advocated that unity, peace, and reform should be sought in the future, and that the army, personnel, and agencies should be streamlined. Cheng Qian was also invited to attend the meeting. He stood up and said that as a local official, he would support Mr. He. Zhang Qun said that although the current situation is very difficult, it is not irredeemable. Taking the flight of an airplane as an example, flying against the wind can fly higher. Mr. He's formation of the cabinet in a difficult situation can better show his contribution. Yu Youren also stood up and said that today is Mr. He's birthday, and he has also been ordered to form a cabinet. At the same time, it is also Mr. Cheng Songyun's birthday, so he specially raised his glass to celebrate. The atmosphere at the meeting was harmonious. More than 20 members who attended the meeting were pleased with the formation of the cabinet and spoke enthusiastically until the meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM. The Central Standing Committee members who were invited to the banquet on the 12th included Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Zhizhong, Bai Chongxi, Wu Zhongxin, Zhu Jiahua, and Shao Lizi.

### Sun Ke and His Wife Arrive in Shanghai, Will Go to Guangzhou for a Short Rest in Three or Four Days, Said Stabilizing Prices Depends on the Realization of Peace

[Report from Our Newspaper] Sun Ke and his wife arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the morning of the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death—the 12th. Later, Sun met with reporters and said that apart from expressing his grief in silence, there were no other actions at home. Next, Sun answered questions about the current situation. The main points are as follows:

(1) I may go to Guangzhou in three or four days. In the future, I will take a short rest and use my spare time to read books related to world affairs, but I do not plan to write a memoir. I have no intention of accepting the position of acting chairman of the Political Council. (2) There are many difficulties in the peace talks, and the formal start is still to be determined. In my personal view, the basic difficulty is that the degree of understanding between the KMT and the Communist Party is too shallow, and the suspicion has not been eliminated. When talking about the issue of army reorganization, there is a need for this in terms of finance. As for the actual difficulties of army reorganization in the process of peace talks, I can only ask the new Premier of the Executive Yuan to answer. (3) It is rumored that the CCP requires control of Beijing and Shanghai as a prerequisite for peace talks. This is a matter for the future and is difficult to achieve. Regarding the content of the peace plan, Sun firmly refused to disclose it, believing that it would hinder the peace talks and be detrimental to the country. (4) After the CCP controls China, our country will inevitably tend to the Soviet Union bloc, but from the perspective of the people, China should not be anti-American or anti-Soviet. In this way, even if there are no new conflicts in the world in the future, our country can stay out of it. Otherwise, our country will suffer war again, and the sacrifices will be so heavy that they will be difficult to recover in a century. In the future, China should not be drawn into other disputes, except to resist foreign military aggression. (5) There are no major mistakes in the past foreign policy of the National Government, but it has not been effective. This is due to the deterioration of the post-war world situation in which countries are competing for hegemony. We cannot do anything about it and cannot bear this responsibility. As far as the US policy towards China is concerned, the past aid to China was to use our country as a tool, and I personally do not agree with it. (6) Political reform must wait for the realization of peace before it can be effectively carried out. As for the Kuomintang itself, it should review its mistakes and resolutely correct its past mistakes before there is hope of revival. (7) The current problems of prices and finance can only be stabilized if peace is realized. Because only after peace can we talk about reducing the army and economizing on government expenditures. With our country's wealth, we can at least maintain one million regular troops in peacetime, but at present, the armed forces of both sides are more than six or seven million? In the past, I advocated reducing the army to 2.5 million, but the military authorities believed that it was impossible to do so. Even the United States, with its wealth, maintains only 1.5 million soldiers in the army, navy, and air force during the Cold War.

### Annual Meeting of the Control Yuan Opens in Beijing Yesterday

### The Type of Peiping

— Jiang Xue

The author is the president of a newspaper and an evening paper in Peiping. During the "localized peace" period in Peiping, both his daily and evening papers were suspended. He originally planned to stay in Peiping. On the 20th of last month, he resolutely left Peiping, traveled along the Jinpu Railway to Jinan, then from Jinan to Qingdao, and arrived in Shanghai by ship at the beginning of this month. He wrote this article partly to commemorate the days he spent and partly to make the public truly understand Peiping as it is now.

"Localized peace means surrender." Yan Xishan once said this. Peiping has now achieved localized peace. The facts of the peace in Peiping prove that this statement is correct. Fu Zuoyi may regret making this move today, but the environment and general situation at the time he made this move also played a part. Without understanding the events before and after the peace talks in Peiping, one cannot understand the truth behind Peiping's achievement of localized peace.

After the government retreated from Changpan and failed in the Northeast, Fu Zuoyi, in his senior cadre meeting, reviewed the failure of the Northeast war and openly criticized the Northeast National Army for "losing without a fight." He confidently told his cadres that if Lin Biao entered the Pass with ten columns, he could withstand it and would give the Communist army a severe blow on the plains of North China. From his military deployments, successively and automatically withdrawing from Qinhuangdao, Huludao, Chengde, Baoding, Zhuozhou, and Tongzhou, shortening the front lines, and concentrating forces, it can be seen that he was working to coordinate with this plan and earnestly hoping to defend Peiping and Tianjin.

According to rumored estimates, after Lin Biao entered the Pass, there would be a major battle in eastern Hebei. Therefore, the forces from Tangshan to Tanggu and Tianjin were greatly strengthened. At the same time, Shi Jue's Ninth Army Group was concentrated in the Miyun and Tongzhou areas to deal with this situation. However, the actions of Lin Biao's troops did not conform to his wishful thinking. After eating up four regiments of Shi Jue's troops in Miyun, they scurried to the Ping-Sui Railway and the northern Chahar area, using a portion of their forces to cut off the Ping-Sui Railway, surround Peiping and Tianjin in a feigned attack, while another portion of their forces occupied the commanding heights of the western suburbs of Peiping - Nankou, advancing westward to join with Nie Rongzhen's forces, and attacking Fu Zuoyi's basic 35th Army and Provisional 3rd Army in northern Chahar. First, they surrounded the 35th Army. The Provisional 3rd Army, in order to rescue the 35th Army, launched a counter-encirclement, which gave the 35th Army a breather, but the Provisional 3rd Army was surrounded by the Communist army. Fortunately, An Chunshan, the commander of the Provisional 3rd Army, was a clever and capable general who broke through the encirclement, but the troops were somewhat routed. An Chunshan himself was captured, disguised as a cook, and escaped without being discovered. Later, An Chunshan successively gathered his old troops, and about two-thirds of them escaped, and they were reorganized into the 104th Army, which is now in Peiping City, jointly responsible for security duties. An Chunshan was a general who rose from the ranks, rich in revolutionary ideas, and Fu Zuoyi relied on him as his right-hand man. When An's whereabouts were unknown, Fu was very anxious! Later, when An escaped to Peiping, Fu met with him and held his hand, expressing indescribable joy.

This was Fu Zuoyi's biggest misstep! This move not only had a great impact on Fu Zuoyi's personal success or failure, but also had a very significant impact on the development of the situation in North China, and even on China's future! Originally, Fu Zuoyi had already decided to withdraw from Zhangjiakou and concentrate his own basic troops in Peiping and Tianjin to participate in the defense of Peiping and Tianjin. However, because Fu Zuoyi had personally returned to Zhangjiakou and met with the speaker of the Chahar Provincial Council for a long talk of three hours, the speaker naturally listed many sufficient reasons, explaining that Zhangjiakou should not be withdrawn from and earnestly requested that Zhangjiakou not be abandoned. Man is an emotional animal, and Fu Zuoyi, who started his career in Chahar and Suiyuan, was affected by this emotional impulse and agreed not to withdraw from Zhangjiakou. This wrong decision not only destroyed Zhangjiakou, destroyed Fu Zuoyi himself, but also destroyed the overall situation in North China! Since Zhangjiakou was not withdrawn from, Fu's basic troops, such as the 35th Army, the Provisional 3rd Army, the Provisional 4th Army, and several cavalry brigades, were stationed in Zhangjiakou and the northern Chahar area and were not transferred back to Peiping and Tianjin. Nie Rongzhen's troops were originally completely concentrated in northern Chahar, plus the new artillery and elite troops that Lin Biao had transferred from outside the Pass, they jointly attacked the 35th Army stationed in Xinbaoan. The 35th Army was indeed a brave and well-trained elite force, with a long-standing reputation in North China. However, due to a delay of two hours in action, and the Communist army's artillery fire was so fierce that people could not lift their heads, the deaths piled up, and the battle situation was tragic! Guo Jingyun, the commander of the 35th Army, was also killed in action. After the fall of Xinbaoan, Zhangjiakou lost its barrier, so Zhangjiakou immediately became agitated and entered a state of chaos. Xinbaoan fell at three or four o'clock that afternoon, and Zhangjiakou decided to withdraw that evening. However, with so many agencies in Chahar Province, as well as the troops of the Provisional 4th Army, it was naturally chaotic to order a retreat at once! Moreover, the terrain of Zhangjiakou is a basin surrounded by mountains on all sides, and the main road to the west is a passage between two mountains. If the Communist army occupied the mountains and attacked, it goes without saying! The reports in the newspapers that the agencies and factories in Zhangjiakou were registered and handed over were not true!

Zhangjiakou was eventually lost, and Fu Zuoyi's basic troops were sacrificed for him! This wrong decision had an even greater impact later, which was on the development of the defense of Peiping and Tianjin. Fu Zuoyi walked around the room in anxiety over this matter and slapped himself in the face.

After the problems of Zhangjiakou and northern Chahar were resolved, the Communist army transferred the forces from the Zhangjiakou area to Peiping and Tianjin. Nie Rongzhen's six columns were reorganized into two army groups, and Lin Biao's three columns were left to form one army group. These three army groups besieged Peiping. The remaining troops under Lin Biao originally in the suburbs of Peiping were transferred to the outskirts of Tianjin and began to attack Tianjin, estimated to be more than eight columns. The main force of the Communist army's attack on Tianjin was concentrated on the west gate, and the battle situation was extremely tragic! They fell one after another, and the deaths numbered in the tens of thousands; however, they finally broke through one point and entered the urban area. In the basement of the garrison headquarters, they captured Chen Changjie, the defending commander who was directing the battle, and forced him to order a ceasefire, thus ending the artillery fire in Tianjin.

### Weekly Forum: A Humble Proposal for Stabilizing Prices Through Cooperative Organizations

— Shou Miancheng

The government has repeatedly carried out financial and economic reforms in the past six months, but prices have ultimately failed to stabilize, which is truly regrettable. How to make price trends slightly more stable and prevent production and sales from stagnating, or even causing the phenomenon of material flight and reverse flow, urgently requires supplementary institutionalized and rationalized measures. Now that the central political situation is being renewed, and General He Yingqin has been ordered to form a cabinet and strongly praises the social policies of the British Labour Party, I believe that the current economic system must undergo considerable reform, and cooperative organizations can exert a great function in price stabilization work. Now, I specially propose ten key points, to seek advice from the wise men of the world.

(1) Universally establish consumer cooperatives to allocate daily necessities. The types and quantities of these allocated goods can be stipulated separately according to the local production and supply and demand situation. However, in principle, it should start with cities first and should be limited to a small number of items, such as five types: grain, cloth, edible salt, cooking oil, and fuel. Among them, cloth can be limited to one or two types. All items that are subject to allocation must be completely handed over to the comprehensive consumer cooperatives in each city, which are responsible for allocation with vouchers, and cannot be distributed by stores at the same time. Where there are no cooperatives, they should be urged to be established immediately, and subsidies should be provided for housing and equipment. Since the government's purpose is to stabilize prices for the people and establish a new economic system, this temporary expenditure should not be haggled over. The population should be jointly agreed upon by the government and the cooperative. If, due to factual needs, this allocation price must be set below cost, the losses will be subsidized by the government. Efforts should be made to ensure that the agreed price does not fluctuate at any time. As for the current method of selling off materials, it is often used by speculators, and the true purpose of price stabilization is not fully achieved, so it is necessary to improve it.

(2) Simultaneously establish production and marketing cooperatives to centralize materials. The premise of allocation is materials. In the past, the government's policy of purchasing materials either set prices too low, making it impossible for producers to recover costs and reducing production, or concentrated purchases by manufacturers in a short period of time, causing prices to rise, while production areas were subject to controls, resulting in higher prices in production areas than in sales areas, and goods flowed exclusively to the capital. Start with production control; at the same time, cooperative societies shall jointly establish warehouses, or the government shall establish warehouses, to store the products of each society. The quantity of products of each society and the warehouse where they are stored shall be reported and registered with the government, and the government shall send personnel to check the items stored in each warehouse, and shall not be transferred without the consent of the government. The prices at which the government purchases products from the societies shall be jointly agreed upon by the government and representatives of the cooperative societies, based on the principles of cost and legitimate profit, and the exchange system of industrial and agricultural products shall be promoted. For example: the purchase of grain can be paid with cloth, in order to promote the farmers' willingness to pay grain. The above five types of allocated goods now have their own institutions responsible for special management. If cooperative organizations can be established at the grassroots level to coordinate and promote with government agencies, and a complete system of production, marketing and distribution can be established, it will surely achieve effective price stabilization.

(3) Control the factories that produce allocated goods and统筹manage them. Large-scale yarn mills and cloth factories are now partly controlled by the government. The scope of control should be further expanded to increase the source of materials. In addition, the larger-scale oil mills should also be controlled by the government. Some coal mines are already under government control, and the scope of control should also be expanded to facilitate allocation business. For factories under government control, the government shall protect the reasonable rights and interests of the factories, and the term of control may be specified in the contract. The original responsible personnel should still stay in the factory to work, and the government should appoint senior officials to supervise them. The products of each factory can be designated to be delivered to a certain cooperative society in a certain place for allocation, or sent to a designated warehouse first, and then allocated to each cooperative society by the government.

(4) Implement thrifty consumption to indirectly increase materials. In order to ensure that there is no shortage of allocated materials, in addition to increasing production, consumption should also be saved to alleviate poverty. In the past, advocating thrift often had little effect. If cooperative methods can be used, it will be easier to promote. For example, promoting cooperative canteens will definitely save grain and fuel. Promoting housing cooperatives will definitely save housing and building materials and appliances. Promoting vehicle cooperation will definitely save gasoline. The principle is very clear.

(5) Strengthen export trade to balance foreign exchange revenue and expenditure. In order to increase production and stabilize prices, it is impossible not to use imported equipment, raw materials and goods at all. However, in order to maintain the foreign exchange balance, these imported goods must be exchanged with export goods. At present, most of China's export goods are agricultural products. Whether the export of agricultural products can be increased depends entirely on whether their production can be increased, whether their quality can be improved, and whether their marketing technology can be improved. In order to achieve this goal, there must be production, marketing and processing cooperative organizations for exporting agricultural products, and large-scale cooperative organizations should be adopted in order to generate concrete effects. After reaching the export destination, either the government can collect and sell them uniformly, or encourage cooperative societies to handle exports. However, if the collection and sales are unified, the price must not be limited too low to protect the legitimate interests of the people. At present, there are already many cooperative products for exporting agricultural products, such as tea, tung oil, peanuts, ramie, etc. In addition, there are some handicrafts that can also be encouraged to be exported through cooperation, and they already have a considerable foundation. In the past, encouraging exports focused on foreign exchange prices, but it should actually start from production and marketing, which is the fundamental solution. Therefore, cooperative organizations are extremely important. (Continued on page 4)

### Prelude to a Large-Scale Crossing-the-Yangtze Offensive? The Communist Army in Southern Henan Points Towards Eastern Hubei. The National Army Along the River Has Adopted Strict Precautions.

[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Xinyang on the 12th] Military news: (1) According to air force reconnaissance reports: About five regiments of Liu Bocheng's troops of the Communist army, which marched north from Xincai, crossed Huangchuan on the 11th and marched towards eastern Hubei. The National Army's strong troops stationed along the Yangtze River line in Qichun and its periphery have adopted strict precautions. The two regiments of the Communist army stationed inside and outside Huangchuan city and the more than 1,000 local Communists who have scurried to the south bank of the Huai River and are constantly providing reinforcements to Luoshan may be attempting to cover their subsequent troops to continue south. According to a certain military authority who told reporters: The Communist army is now actively preparing to cross the Yangtze River in the upper and lower reaches. At this time, it is noteworthy that it is using a part of its troops in southeastern Henan to meander south, concentrating its forces on both sides of the Huai River on the east side of the Ping-Han Railway, in order to test the strength of the National Army in eastern Hubei along the Yangtze River in the hinterland of southern Henan. However, this action by the Communist army has just begun, and the military here has already anticipated it and prepared for it. From this point of view, it seems impossible for the Communist army to take the lead in launching a large-scale crossing-the-Yangtze offensive in the Central China theater. (2) The actions of the Communist army on the east side of the Ping-Han Railway, and the "anti-persecution" movement launched by 100,000 Red Spear Society members (i.e., the Red Spear Society) west of the railway against the Communist army in various parts of the Tongbai Mountain area, have aroused great attention from the military and civilians here. Local people in Henan Province have now launched a fundraising campaign to provide relief and condolences to the Red Spear Society members and refugees who were killed and injured in Xinyang and Tongbai counties. Many people have spontaneously donated money. (3) Chairman Zhang Zhen told reporters today that he is very concerned about the fact that the people of southern Henan have clashed with the Communist army in various places in order to protect their own interests, resulting in continuous bloodshed. In addition to issuing a notice to all counties to exempt those who participate in the people's self-defense training from military service, and to exempt them from some of their ancestral obligations, he also issued a handwritten order to the military and political responsible agencies in his jurisdiction to be strictly on guard, because in this "people's century," it is difficult for those who violate the interests of the people to survive.

[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Xinyang on the 12th] (1) More than 10,000 people from the Second Column of Liu Bocheng's troops continued to forcibly cross the Huai River north of Huangchuan and invaded south. The National Army's air force had no choice but to dispatch bombing raids, but the Communist army still ventured to attack. At the moment, its vanguard troops have scurried to the south of Huangchuan. Also, a part of the Communist army of about 200 people north of Luoshan has been surrounded by the National Army and can be completely wiped out immediately. (2) More than 2,000 Communist troops were discovered near Xingzhaiji, east of Zhengyang, and were repelled by the National Army, and many puppet county heads and officials were captured. At the moment, the situation in Zhengyang has turned from danger to safety.

### The Armed People of Southern Henan: Red Spear Society Members Exceed 100,000; Incense Smoke Lingers During Marches

[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Xinyang on the 10th] (Delayed) The Red Spear Society (also known as the People's Self-Defense Force), which was launched by the people of 28 counties in southern Henan to "demand peace through armed struggle," has become increasingly powerful since it captured Tongbai County on the morning of the 9th. According to news on the morning of the 10th: The Red Spear Society members in Tanghe, Nanyang, Dengxian, Zhenping, Biyang, Zhengyang, Runan, and Suixian and Zao yang in northern Hubei have responded in large numbers. Its armed members have exceeded 100,000. When they march, they still use a large red silk flag or a red cloth flag as a guide, followed by a copper incense burner filled with sandalwood, carried by two or four people, mixed in the ranks. Behind them, they also carry ancient-style instruments of torture, such as the copper guillotine used by Bao Wencheng in the Song Dynasty, in order to be able to pronounce sentences from time to time when capturing elements who violate the interests of the people. Some armed people carrying rifles and holding red-tasseled spears sang loudly and rushed forward,簇拥crowding the copper furnace with its lingering smoke. This monotheistic people's armed force is giving a boost to the local Communists in various parts of southern Henan.

### Financial Difficulties in Jiangxi

The Export of Rice Has Not Yet Been Lifted; The Central Cooperative's Plan to Purchase Grain in Shanghai Has Been Shelved.

[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Nanchang on the 12th] The provincial finances after the promulgation of the new financial reform plan must be implemented from July. For the provincial expenses in March and June, the central government will still subsidize 70%. However, at present, Jiangxi's finances are feeling very difficult due to the lack of funds in the Central Bank, and the central government's payment orders cannot be allocated on time due to the vast expenditures of the national treasury. For example, the 60-fold increase in the new treatment for Jiangxi's public educators in February has not yet been issued, and a portion must be raised and issued again in March to maintain their livelihood. At present, the provincial-level staff's salaries for March may be advanced in part next week. In addition to explaining the recent provincial administration at a press conference on the 12th, Chairman Fang Tian also stated that Jiangxi rice has not yet been decontrolled. The Central Cooperative's plan to purchase grain on behalf of the Shanghai People's Food Association, more than 30,000 dans, cannot be shipped out.

### The Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu Gathers 100,000; The Intention to Cross the Yangtze River Is Increasingly Clear

[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Zhenjiang on the 12th] The Provincial Security Department released the battle situation in northern Jiangsu for the past week on the 12th: The main force of the Communist army's field army in northern Jiangsu is actively pressing close to the edge of the Yangtze River, and the rear transportation is frequent. It is estimated that the Tenth Column, originally stationed in the Shaobo-Xiannü Temple area, has begun to move east in recent days. The Eleventh Column is still stationed in the Rugao-Nantong area, and the Twelfth Column is stationed in the Taixing-Jingjiang area. In the past week, it has been discovered that its Fourth, Ninth, and Thirteenth Columns seem to have also transferred to the Taixian-Taixing-Jingjiang area. Whether this is the case is currently being urgently investigated to collect materials to confirm it. In total, the field army and local teams of the Communist army in northern Jiangsu do not number less than 100,000. Chen Yi's inspection of various places in Jiangbei and Su Yu's quasi-residence in Taixing seem to be clear evidence of their intention to reorganize and cross the Yangtze River.

### A Sudden Increase in Outbound Passengers from Taiwan. The Joint Statement of the Speakers of All Counties and Cities States that the Request to Limit Population and Entry Is Not Xenophobic.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 12th] A sudden increase in outbound passengers from Taiwan Province. The more than 2,000 cabins of the Zhongxing Wheel sailing to Shanghai on the 12th have recently been completely sold out. Due to overcrowding, the China Aviation Company's Taiwan-Shanghai flights have suspended registration since the 11th. Tickets for the Central Aviation Company's flights to Shanghai also need to be purchased after a week. This batch of departing passengers will not return to the mainland in the short term. Since the mainland Province implemented the entry permit on March 1, only more than 400 people have been approved to enter the country after passing the review. Therefore, this batch of departing passengers from Taiwan Province has almost no intention of returning to Taiwan. According to statistics, in the past two or three months, there have been more inbound passengers than outbound passengers to Taiwan Province, and housing and prices have been directly affected. Since the implementation of the entry registration certificate, the number of inbound passengers has decreased sharply, with only more than 100 or even more than 10 people per ship. Recently, some people have been brewing to abolish the entry permit method. However, the speakers of all county and city councils in Taiwan Province have jointly issued a written statement, saying, "Limiting the entry of population is the demand of the people of Taiwan. Since the restoration, everyone has been very welcome to people from the motherland to Taiwan to guide the work of reviving and building the country. In the past few years, Taiwan has made progress as a result of the assistance of many people. However, in recent years, due to the instability on the mainland, we should welcome people coming to Taiwan in large numbers. All people within the four seas are brothers. Moreover, the people of the mainland Province and the people of Taiwan share the same bloodline. What is the difference between them? However, due to the sharp increase in population, a food and housing panic has occurred, which is quite easy to cause social chaos and stimulate prices. Nowadays, the price of rice in Taiwan, which produces rice, is still higher than on the mainland. In order to maintain the stability of the country, we have to ask the government to take temporary expedient measures. It is a matter of utmost importance and is not xenophobic or has any other meaning."

### Guangdong Provincial Industry Association Requests That Goods Tax Be Exempted from Payment in Kind.

### Buying and Selling Unlicensed Gold and Silver by Silver and Money Firms Will Be Punished According to Relevant Banking Laws

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The financial reform plan stipulates that people are allowed to freely trade gold and silver. The Central Bank may also buy and sell gold and silver to stabilize the market price. However, if general silver and money firms are allowed to purchase and sell gold and silver in large quantities, whether for value preservation or profit-making purposes, it is not in line with the proper course of business operations. In order to implement the policy of stabilizing finance, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated that banks, except those with special permits, are still not allowed to sell raw gold and silver. Those who violate this regulation will be punished according to the relevant provisions of the Banking Law. As for the short-term gold public bonds issued by the government in the 38th year, which are valuable securities, silver and money firms, within the scope of their approved business by the Ministry, can buy and sell valuable securities, and they are naturally allowed to buy and sell gold public bonds. However, after winning the lottery at maturity, they should report the gold obtained from the repayment of principal and interest, as well as subsequent transfers, to the Ministry of Finance for record.

### Safeguarding the Security of the Eastern Mediterranean Region; Britain, the United States, and France Will Issue a Declaration; Foreign Ministers of the Five Western European Nations Will Visit the US at the End of the Month; Details of the Atlantic Treaty Extension Will Be Announced Next Friday

[United Press, Washington, 12th] The State Department announced that as a result of Secretary of State Acheson's meeting with the ambassadors of seven countries yesterday, some details of the North Atlantic Treaty have been clarified. The ambassadors of the seven countries will continue to visit Acheson next week to discuss the signing ceremony and notify the US government of the ratification by their respective governments.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 11th] Well-informed sources confirmed tonight that the foreign ministers of the five Western Union nations are scheduled to travel to the United States on the "Queen Mary" from Southampton on the 26th of this month to attend the signing ceremony of the Atlantic Treaty, which is expected to take place around April 4th.

[Reuters, Washington, 11th] At the request of the French government, the full text of the Atlantic Treaty has been postponed until next Friday. Another meeting will be held next week, at which the Italian ambassador to the United States may also attend. It is also learned that another issue most valued by the negotiators of the treaty is the declaration to be issued by Britain, the United States, and France regarding Turkey, Greece, and Iran. Although these countries are not participating in the Atlantic Treaty, they have all received US military assistance, the nature of which is equivalent to the military assistance that the United States will provide to the countries of the Atlantic Treaty. Therefore, it is necessary to issue a declaration to clarify the nature of military assistance to Greece, Turkey, and other countries. At the same time, the representatives of Greece, Turkey, and other countries also believe that any security system that does not take into account the status of the Eastern Mediterranean countries is incomplete.

[Reuters, Washington, 11th] Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen met with Acheson for more than an hour today to discuss the details of the Atlantic Treaty. Afterwards, Rasmussen told reporters that the talks were only preliminary in nature and that he would need to continue talks with Acheson before leaving the United States. The issue of military assistance in conjunction with the Atlantic Treaty was discussed today, but the issue of the Greenland military base was not touched upon. Rasmussen also revealed that he had explained the political situation in Denmark to Acheson in detail, and also discussed relations with Norway.

### Debate on Participation in the Western Treaty in the Italian Parliament is Fierce; Special Meeting Convened Today for Final Vote; Communists Incite Strikes to Protest Government Decisions

[United Press, Rome, 12th] Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi will convene a special meeting of Congress tomorrow, attempting to counter the Communist Party's efforts to incite public opinion against Italy's participation in the Atlantic Pact. Communist leaders ordered a strike on the 12th and will hold a demonstration on the 23rd to protest the government's "war policy." Within hours of this move, De Gasperi decided to bring forward the debate and urge Parliament to vote on the issue as soon as possible.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 11th] The Italian Parliament discussed the Atlantic Treaty today, and the debate was fierce. A motion proposed by Nenni, the leader of the majority Socialist Party who is pro-Communist, was rejected by a vote of 311 to 165, and the government won safely. Nenni's motion requested the government to explain in detail to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Congress the tasks undertaken by Italy under the treaty. Prime Minister De Gasperi spoke first, arguing that joining the treaty was another guarantee against war and did not ask Italy to undertake any matters beyond its defense capabilities. Italy's strategic position unfortunately has international value, so it will do its best to seek peace. De Gasperi then briefly outlined Italy's foreign policy, saying that Italy is now paying close attention to the customs union with France and the creation of a European parliament. Regarding the peace treaty, De Gasperi said that Italy has not asked for it to be revised, and now it is only waiting for Italy's requests to be fulfilled in a peaceful atmosphere. De Gasperi concluded by praising the various achievements made by the government in the country. After the Prime Minister's speech, Nenni took the floor, saying that the government's proposal to join the Atlantic Treaty was even more serious than the Mussolini government's decision to join the Axis Pact in 1939. Communist leader Togliatti also strongly criticized the treaty, saying that it would divide the world into two, and that the treaty would put Italy on the road to disaster, and hoped that the government would continue to clarify it. Then Foreign Minister Sforza rose to answer, saying that there were no secret documents attached to the treaty, nor were there any conspiracies, and that the negotiations were conducted openly. After the Foreign Minister's reply, the Prime Minister returned to the podium to declare his intention to inform the members of Congress of all the contents of the treaty, and emphasized that according to the Constitution, the government can negotiate the treaty first, and then submit it to Congress for debate. Now, for the first time in Italian history, the Congress is asked to give the government its trust before negotiating the treaty. At this point, Nenni's motion was put to a vote and rejected by a majority.

### Finland Leans Towards the West; Soviet Writer Denounces

[Agence France-Presse, Tel Aviv, 11th] The Israeli Foreign Minister today solemnly denied the rumors of Israeli troops invading Transjordan, but said that a small incident occurred in the Aqaba area five days ago, when a Transjordanian patrol team invaded Israeli territory by several kilometers and clashed with a small number of Israeli troops. The Israeli side has absolutely no intention of crossing into Arab territory. He has requested the United Nations mediator Bunche to send personnel to conduct an on-site investigation to clarify the truth.

### Former French General Giraud Passes Away Yesterday; Captured Six Times During the War and Escaped Every Time

[United Press, Paris, 12th] French General Giraud, who had experienced two world wars, passed away in the Army Hospital of Dijon tonight at the age of seventy. Giraud served as the commander of the French army in North Africa when the Allied forces landed in North Africa in 1942. Later, he had a disagreement with De Gaulle and retired in 1944, living in Metz with his wife and two daughters. He was extremely alert throughout his life. He was captured by the German army six times during the two world wars and escaped every time. The last time he was captured was on May 21, 1940, when he was imprisoned in Königstein Castle in Saxony, Germany. He did not escape until April 1942. His escape was extremely dramatic. Prior to that, Giraud spent eight months painstakingly weaving a 65-foot-long rope. The thread used for weaving was divided into many small strands by his wife and sent to him in letters. On the night he climbed out of the high walls of Königstein Castle, he happened to meet a German sentinel. Giraud calmly greeted him in fluent German, saying: "It's very cold tonight, isn't it, kid?" Then he whistled and strode forward, and the German soldier did not notice anything.

It is reported that Turkey is now striving to promote the organization of a Mediterranean alliance among the countries with Mediterranean relations, in order to establish connections with the North Atlantic Alliance in the future.

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 12th] According to unofficial sources here, Egypt is willing to remain neutral on the possible conclusion of the Mediterranean Pact. The same source also pointed out that after reviewing the issue, the Egyptian government believes that it is better to maintain its current policy and not participate in any international agreements with military obligations.

### Despair in Resolving the Dispute Between the Four Powers; New Currency to Be Issued in West Berlin

[United Press, Berlin, 11th] Responsible authorities have announced that the United States, Britain, and France have decided to adopt a new financial plan in West Berlin in order to drive the East German Mark issued by the Soviet Union out of West Berlin. This move will clarify the financial chaos caused by the competition between the two Marks in West Berlin and can promote industrial production. The new monetary system can be announced immediately, stipulating that the "Clay Mark" is the only currency in West Berlin. The currency issue was originally the main dispute in the Soviet blockade of Berlin, and the announcement of this move by the West is sufficient to indicate that the path to a negotiated solution has been declared hopeless.

### Public Utilities Price Base to be Reviewed and Announced This Afternoon; Representatives at the Meeting Vigorously Argued with the Heads of Various Companies Yesterday; Dividend Issue Becomes Focus of Dispute

[Report from this newspaper] After the Municipal Council decided to adjust the prices of public utilities based on the multiple of the cost of living index, the base of each item will be announced this afternoon. The principle for reviewing and finalizing the base was decided yesterday. The Public Utilities Subcommittee of the Municipal Council is scheduled to hold a temporary meeting at 3:00 PM today in the Council Meeting Room to discuss and decide on the base of public utilities before announcing it. The new method will be implemented after the cost of living index for employees in the city is released the day after tomorrow (the 15th).

Yesterday, Jiang Haoran, Li Wenjie, Zhu Fuju, Yu Shun, He Yuanming and other representatives of the Public Utilities Subcommittee of the Municipal Council, together with the heads of major public utilities companies in the city, spent the entire day conducting the work of reviewing and finalizing the base on the fourth floor of the Municipal Bank. The meeting started at 10:00 AM and did not end until after 5:00 PM. It is reported that the meeting was tense and heated throughout, and there was no time to rest even for lunch. The representatives of the Council and the company authorities argued fiercely, and there were several times when they could not agree, so the base could not be finalized smoothly yesterday. According to reporter's inquiries: The focus of the dispute is on the dividend issue. According to the decision of the previous Public Utilities Subcommittee meeting, in this time of crisis, any enterprise should prioritize service. The dividend item of each company should be temporarily removed, while the company insisted that dividends must be included in order to maintain the enterprise. As for the base item, both parties agreed to use the "August 19" price as the basis, which is the base price announced by each public utility when priced in Customs Gold Units for the previous time. The reason why they could not agree is that the Council believes that after the dividend is removed, the base should be reduced according to the original base price, while the company, in addition to insisting on not accepting the removal of dividends, stated that its base should be appropriately increased compared to the original base price. They believe that if the prices of public utilities are priced in Customs Gold Units, they can be adjusted daily according to the US dollar. Now that the method has been changed to adjust according to the cost of living index, the company can only increase prices twice a month. In order to compensate for the loss, they firmly insist that the base must be increased, which has resulted in a large gap between the two parties on reviewing and finalizing the base, which ultimately prevented the meeting from having concrete results yesterday.

In order to take care of the burden on citizens, the Public Utilities Subcommittee of the Municipal Council will insist on minimizing the base of public utilities as much as possible, so it has decided to convene a temporary meeting this afternoon to study it again and make a final decision. The issue of adjusting the prices of public utilities, which is of most concern to citizens throughout the city, should have concrete results today.

### Water, Electricity, and Telephone Bills Still Priced in Customs Gold Units

Citizens Feel Very Confused About This

[Report from this newspaper] After the method of pricing public utilities in Customs Gold Units was cancelled by the Municipal Council, most stores and households in the city have received water, electricity, and telephone bills from various companies one after another, which list the prices calculated in Customs Gold Units, and require payment within a time limit. Otherwise, the overdue difference will be recovered or the electricity will be cut off. Citizens feel very confused about this and do not know whether to pay immediately or refuse to pay. They hope that the Municipal Council and the public utilities authorities will provide clear instructions.

### Impersonating Military Officers to Forcibly Sell Paintings and Calligraphy; Extortion from Factories Exposed; Eight Villains Arrested on the Spot; Thief Wears Major General's Uniform

[Report from this newspaper] The Xujiahui Police Sub-Bureau received a report the day before yesterday that unscrupulous discharged soldiers were using "proof" documents with inscriptions from important people to forcibly sell crude paintings and calligraphy to manufacturers and residents in the area under its jurisdiction and extort money. After Chen, the sub-bureau chief, sent personnel to investigate and confirmed the facts, he arrested eight current offenders who were forcibly selling and extorting money in the Shanghai Marble Factory at No. 554, Hongqiao Road, Xujiahui yesterday afternoon. On the spot, they seized a note that read, "Limit five minutes to send all the things, otherwise it will be unfavorable to you." In addition, there was a "proof paper" with inscriptions from Li Zongren, Shao Lizi, Hong Lanyou, Bai Yunti, Xu Kan, Pan Gongzhan, and others. Among the offenders, two were wearing Army Major General uniforms, one named Zhang Hongbin, claiming to be a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and the other named Dai Qian. One was a Lieutenant Colonel, named Huang Wende. One was a Major, named Huang Hua. One was a Lieutenant, named Zhang Miaocheng. One was wearing an Air Force uniform, named Ye Yucheng, claiming to be the flying pilot of the third detachment of the first squadron of the Taiwan Air Force. One was wearing a police uniform, named Mei Guangzheng, claiming to be a patrol officer of the Suzhou North District Sub-Bureau. Another person was wearing plain clothes, named Jiang Xinhou. After being taken to the bureau for interrogation, they confessed that they had gone to the Shanghai Marble Factory on the 11th to sell paintings and calligraphy worth 40,000 yuan. Later, because they felt that the money was not enough to cover the cost, they went again today (the 12th) to ask the factory to increase the amount appropriately. Later, after a detailed investigation by the bureau, it was discovered that Dai Qian and Jiang Xinshi had committed many theft cases before and had been sentenced to imprisonment by the Garrison Command and the court. Chen, the sub-bureau chief, reported to Director Mao of the General Bureau and requested instructions on how to deal with them. After Mao received the report, he was furious and immediately ordered Gan Jue, the chief of the Detective Section, to transfer the above-mentioned offenders to the General Bureau for trial.

### The Instigator of the Plane Hijacking to the Communists Turns Out to Be a Civil Aviation Administration Employee: Xing Guozheng, Former Deputy Director of the Control Tower at Longhua Airport

[Report from Our Newspaper] The inside story of China Airlines flight 135, a Shanghai-Qingdao flight that mysteriously landed in Jinan, a Communist-controlled area, has gradually come to light since the return of the three crew members to Shanghai. The plane was forced to change course mid-flight by a group of passengers with guns. There were five male hijackers, one female, and one infant. According to confirmations gathered by our reporters from various sources, these individuals were not Communist personnel, but a group instigated by an employee of the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Transportation. The leader was named Xing Guozheng, formerly the deputy director of the air traffic control station at Longhua Airport, who had served in the Air Force for a considerable time. He was later sent to the U.S. Civil Aeronautics Administration to study air traffic control and returned to China to assume the position of deputy director of the control station at Longhua.

Impression of Xing Guozheng

On December 15, 1947, the local edition of this newspaper published a feature story about the air traffic control station, the material for which was provided by Xing. He was quite young, estimated to be under thirty years old. The reporter recalls the conversations with him at Longhua, finding him quite energetic, though he seemed somewhat impatient. At that time, he was assisting Xu Bingxie, the head of the station, and even introduced the reporter to him. A few months later, it was heard that he had been transferred to Guangzhou, and no further news was heard of him since. More than a year later, it is unexpected that he would hijack a plane to join the Communists.

Names of the Six People

It is reported that on the day of the incident, after placing the pilot, co-pilot, and radio operator under surveillance, Xing took over the controls. However, due to unfamiliarity with the performance of the C47 aircraft, he was unable to land it. In the end, he forced the co-pilot to land the plane safely. In addition to Xing Guozheng, the names of the others who participated in the hijacking and are currently staying in Jinan, as discovered by our reporter, are as follows: Chen Tiesheng, Hua Xinghang, Mou Huanhai, Liu Shurong, Liu Jiying (female), and Liu Didi (infant). As for the reasons why they took such a drastic step, the Civil Aviation Administration office here remains tight-lipped, even refusing to confirm or deny whether they are indeed employees of the Civil Aviation Administration.

### Late Payment of Land Value Tax: New Penalty Rules Implemented, Based on the Price Index Multiplied by the Tax Amount Due

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the Land Administration Bureau began collecting land value tax in this city, the violent fluctuations in prices and the fixed legal tax rate, have resulted in sharp revenue decline, affecting the city treasury. Most citizens are willing to pay the land value tax, but a few large property owners are holding back, delaying payment, because their income is too low to afford it. According to Director Xie and Secretary Qian of the Land Administration Bureau, the land value tax of Hartong Real Estate, which owns so much property, is only three million yuan, so the claim of not being able to afford it is hard to believe. According to Article 200 of the Land Law, a late fee of 2% is added for overdue tax payments, but this amount is too small. A municipal council meeting has passed an additional late fee of 15% and an additional tax of 30%, but the amounts are still small. In view of this, the central government ordered the Land Administration Bureau yesterday to calculate overdue payments by multiplying the tax amount due by the local price index compiled by the Economic Research Department of the Central Bank, starting from the date the notice is issued, changing every ten days, which could result in a significant increase in land value tax revenue. The new method will be implemented tomorrow.

### Accountant of the Hand-Knitted Cotton Weaving Union Sentenced to Three Months for Short Delivery of Allotted Yarn

[Report from Our Newspaper] Xiong Xingyu, the accountant of the Hand-Knitted Cotton Weaving Union in this city, was also in charge of cotton yarn allocation. On September 28 of last year, when the union distributed the 61st installment of cotton yarn, there was an excess of 81 bales, which were temporarily stored with Xi Jianwu, the representative of the 4th district, who issued a receipt for the union's records. In November of the same year, when the 62nd installment of yarn was distributed, the 4th district received 47 bales less than the allotted amount. Xiong instructed Xi to make up for the shortage from the 81 bales stored from the 61st installment. Later, Xiong was involved in another case, and the union investigated old accounts, demanding that Xi return the 81 small bales of stored yarn. Xi truthfully explained the situation. The union reported Xiong's shortage of 47 bales of yarn from the 62nd installment to the District Procuratorate, and yesterday, Judge Ge Jiannong of the District Court sentenced Xiong Xingyu to three months in prison for using fraudulent means to cause another person to deliver property belonging to a third party.

### Empty Check Used to Purchase Goods: Cotton Weaving Factory Fooled

[Report from Our Newspaper] At about 3 PM on the 8th, a Wang (from Ningbo), a peddler of general merchandise, came to Qixin Cotton Weaving Factory at No. 38 Yiye Lane, Ji'an Road, to buy men's and women's undershirts. Hu Jinyuan, the manager of the factory, received him. They selected 150 dozen of No. 505 round-neck shirts and 40 dozen of No. 600 women's undershirts, totaling 1,965,000 yuan. He ordered apprentices Fang Yulin and Zhang Chunhong to accompany Wang to Andong Inn on Hubei Road. Yin Caibao and Sun Binxian, guests in room 204 of the inn, counted the goods downstairs and Wang Kang signed a check from Fuchang Commercial Bank for 1,965,000 yuan, dated the 11th. However, when the check was presented, it was returned. The factory couldn't find Wang Kang. Yin and Sun said that they had sold 150 dozen of No. 505 round-neck shirts to Yongxiang Socks Factory on Fangbang Road in Nanshi the same night, and that they had delivered them with the three of them, there were still ten dozens of women's undershirts, hidden in Yin Caibao's home. He turned Yin and Sun over to the Lao Zha Police Precinct, reporting the circumstances. Section Chief Zhang Kuidong instructed patrol officer Wang Anbang and police officer Sun Zhiming to rush to Yongxiang Socks Factory to retrieve most of the men's and women's undershirts, and also to arrest Wang Kang, who was at large.

### Young Woman Killed by Lover: Thrown Lime, Both Eyes Blinded

[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Feng, a young woman living at No. 15, Lane 63, Dalin Road, Nanshi, was originally living with a peddler. Later, the woman was arrested and sent to court for selling heroin and sentenced to imprisonment. While in prison, she developed a love affair with Qiu Changlin, a plasterer sentenced for rape. Recently, the two were released on parole and began cohabiting. However, after only a few days, the woman, dissatisfied with Qiu's lack of legitimate income, broke up with him and resumed living with the peddler. Qiu, in a fit of jealousy, suddenly invited the woman out yesterday afternoon. When they passed the French School at Ba Xian Bridge, Qiu took out a bag of lime he had prepared and threw it in the woman's face. The woman's eyes were blinded and she screamed for help. The police and passersby who heard the screams arrested Qiu and sent him to the police station. The woman was taken to Si Ming Hospital for emergency treatment, but because the lime was highly corrosive, she was already blind in both eyes when she arrived at the hospital.

### Preliminary Discussion on Stabilizing Prices Through Cooperative Organizations (Continued from Page Two)

(6) Using US Aid to Strengthen Price Stabilization Efforts: We propose that textiles and grains from US aid should be allocated to consumer cooperatives for distribution at fair prices, with preferential treatment for the poor and public employees. Fertilizers should be allocated to agricultural cooperatives, with preferential treatment for poor farmers and owner-cultivators. These allocated goods should be repaid with harvested produce. The recovered agricultural products should be distributed to consumer cooperatives or industrial cooperatives, according to their nature.

(7) Eliminating Idle Capital and Implementing a Transfer Accounting System: If the government can implement a transfer accounting system to eliminate sources of idle capital, every expenditure or loan can be tracked, reducing the need for currency circulation. For example, every manufacturer or cooperative should open an account with a bank, and all receipts and payments should be made through the bank using checks. Individuals should use cooperatives as a hub, and banks should establish a clearinghouse, which would make it difficult for idle capital to arise.

Improving Financial Facilities and Expanding Fair-Price Production and Sales Loans: The most advanced monetary theory today is managed standard. Under a managed standard, the circulating currency is like today's gold yuan. Therefore, the currency itself is not the problem; the problem is the technique of currency management. If we are afraid of inflation and dare not lend, but on the other hand, we dare not not lend in order to increase production, the result will be a contradictory financial phenomenon. This contradiction will inevitably prevent production from increasing and inflation from being avoided. We believe that there are several types of loans that can help stabilize prices and should not be considered inflationary. First, consumer cooperative loans can purchase fair-priced goods and implement fair-price distribution. Second, allocated goods production loans can recover physical goods and implement fair-price distribution. Third, agricultural product transportation and sales cooperative loans can enable farmers to jointly transport agricultural products to the market. Sold at government-controlled prices, avoiding middleman exploitation. Fourth, various cooperative loans in pacified areas can stabilize people's livelihoods, win hearts and minds, and can be used to seize materials and block materials. Fifth, export material production and sales cooperative loans can enable export goods to bypass the hands of merchants and be concentrated in government-dedicated institutions. These loans should be fully planned and controlled, and should be re-mortgaged by the Central Bank to achieve effective results.

(9) Strengthening Cooperative Management and Promoting Sound Development: Judging from the above, some may think that this plan can only be implemented when cooperatives are truly sound. This is not the case. After all, cooperative enterprises are one sector of various enterprises run by the people. People's morality and ability cannot be without merits and demerits, that is, the results of various enterprises cannot be without differences. Since various enterprises cannot be without differences, cooperative enterprises cannot be without merits and demerits. When we look at cooperative organizations, we only ask whether they are more in line with ideal requirements in nature and system, and whether they are likely to be sound. We should not make harsh demands on cooperation beyond society and beyond the times. We should use various forces to seek sound development in common application and common assistance, which can be called justice. Moreover, the cooperative system is bound to encounter strong resistance because it conflicts with vested interests, which is inevitable for any socialization movement. If we lightly accept because someone resists and cannot remain steadfast, the economic system will never be reformed!

(10) Strictly Implementing Reward and Punishment Measures to Establish Discipline: Stabilizing prices should focus on production, sales, and consumer cooperatives, as well as factories that produce allocated goods. All private enterprises that do not belong to these tasks should be subject to various restrictions. Those who deliberately undermine the fair-price policy should be punished accordingly, while the cooperatives and factories should be given various incentives. Cooperatives and factories can carry out production increase and fair-price competitions, and those with outstanding achievements should be given highly honored awards. If there is poor performance or embezzlement in these cooperatives and fair-price factories, they should be subject to the same punishments as speculative merchants. (March 8, March 12)

### Grand Gathering in Zhongshan Park to Commemorate Arbor Day: Leaders' Addresses Were Thought-Provoking, Emphasizing the Equal Importance of Planting Trees and Cultivating People

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday was the 38th Arbor Day, and the Municipal Bureau of Public Works and the Bureau of Social Affairs held a commemorative meeting at Zhongshan Park yesterday morning at 9:30 AM. The presidium was composed of military and police leaders of this city, with Mayor Wu Guozhen, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Director of Public Works Zhao Zukang, Director of Social Affairs Cao Peizi, Director of Education Li Ximou, Police Chief Mao Sen, Chairman of the General Labor Union Zhou Xuexiang, Chairman of the Rice Industry Association Wan Molin, Senators Zhang Zhongyuan, Yu Shun, and others attending. At the beginning of the meeting, Mayor Wu gave a speech, stating: "Today is Arbor Day, and it is also the anniversary of the death of the Founding Father. Every year, we think of an ancient saying, 'It takes ten years to grow a tree, and a hundred years to cultivate a person.' Whether it is planting trees or cultivating people, we must strive to nurture and support them, and regardless of how harsh the environment, there will be excellent results."

Strict Prohibition of Cutting Down Trees is Hoped For

Speaker Pan gave a speech, stating: "Cause and effect are mutually cyclical. Today, we diligently plant trees one by one, and in ten or a hundred years, there will be forests of trees. As the saying goes, 'You reap what you sow.' Whether it is being a person, studying, or doing things, this principle applies." Then, Police Chief Mao Sen gave a speech, stating: "Today, seeing a green expanse in the park symbolizes that winter has passed and spring has arrived, giving people a feeling of excitement. The current situation is like a dull winter, and I believe it will pass soon, and a thriving spring will arrive." Chairman Wan Molin expressed that trees must be protected after planting. Recently, there have been cases of soldiers illegally cutting down trees, and he hoped that the authorities would strictly prohibit this. Senator Zhang Zhongyuan stated that both cultivating people and planting trees are important, and that Arbor Day should consider the countless out-of-school children in this city.

Greening of Qingdao is a Model to Learn From

Director of Social Affairs Cao Peizi encouraged everyone with the story of planting trees in Qingdao. He said: "Thirty years ago, Qingdao was a barren island, but now it has become a green garden. The Germans did well to develop this area. At that time, the Germans planted trees to find fresh water sources, and to protect the trees, they issued a strict order that anyone who removed a tree would have one finger cut off. Since then, Qingdao has been covered with green leaves, ensuring water sources. Therefore, protecting trees is very important." Finally, Director of Public Works Zhao Zukang reported that there are more than 20,000 trees in this city, an increase of more than 8,000 since the takeover. Cases of soldiers randomly cutting down trees do occur, and he hoped that the relevant authorities would provide assistance. After the presidium finished speaking, the music team led the way to the earthen mound on the west side of Zhongshan Park, where Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, and others personally planted a tree each. The commemorative meeting concluded at 10:30 AM.

### Kuomintang Municipal Party Department Commemorates the Death of Premier

Fang Zhi Gave a Speech Encouraging Party Members to Work Hard

[Central News Agency] The Kuomintang Municipal Party Department held a meeting at the Shanghai Club at 9 AM yesterday to commemorate the 24th anniversary of the death of Premier Sun Yat-sen. More than 500 cadres and comrades from various district party branches attended, as well as Central Committee members Zhang Zhiben and Pan Gongzhan, and Shen Zonglian, representative of Mayor Wu. Chairman Fang Zhi reported that the Kuomintang had too much compromise, did not value talent, and did not study the doctrine. In addition to the various defects of vigorously implementing the doctrine, he pointed out how to unite in the future, loyal to the party and patriotic followers of the Prime Minister, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the Prime Minister, address past mistakes, and strive for innovation to save the party and the country from danger. Next, Committee Member Zhang Zhiben elaborated on the true meaning of the Prime Minister's advocacy of peace and struggle to save China, and said that in order to realize true and lasting peace, we must follow the principles of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, and righteousness advocated by the Prime Minister. Committee Member Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech, saying: "Today, when we commemorate the death of the Prime Minister, we must recall the history of the Prime Minister's northward journey for peace in 1924. At that time, the Prime Minister was for true peace, while the Beiyang warlords were for false peace. Today, the whole country is eager for peace, but we must be able to distinguish the true from the false. President Chiang's withdrawal and the withdrawal of the National Army north of the Yangtze River show our sincerity in seeking peace, while the Communist Party is mobilizing troops everywhere, gathering troops, and encroaching step by step. Those who do not understand the situation or have ulterior motives are still criticizing the government, which is extremely unfair." The audience shouted slogans in a mood of enthusiasm and indignation and dispersed.

### Women's Day in Guilin

— Special Correspondent Liang Yushan and Zhang Meng of This Newspaper

[Report from This Newspaper in Guilin on the 10th] The "March 8th Festival" celebration, with the attendance of the wife of Acting President Li, was even more lively than in previous years, with more than a thousand people attending, only seven of whom were men. Guo Dejie spoke about the principle of "ordering the family and then governing the country," and put forward two slogans: "Society is ours, and the kitchen is also ours."

Yin Xi (Queen of Guiju Opera Xiao Jinfeng), a member of the presidium, also gave a speech. She said, "Today, women's status in society is very painful, and this pain is inflicted on us by men. I am the most miserable woman, and my life experience is also very rich. I think we women should find ways to turn ourselves over. Marrying a bad husband is a bad thing, and we should get a divorce. If you don't get a divorce, the pain will be even deeper. I have been through it!" This statement by this famous person, who was known by Ma Junwu, aroused great interest from the audience.

The conference, which was not attended by "homemakers," lasted half an hour in the Provincial Government Auditorium before it ended. At noon, the Rongcheng Guiju Opera Troupe hosted the women and performed "Afraid of His Wife," "Three Pleas for Lihua," "Mother Meng Teaches Her Son," and other excerpts.

Women's Day passed like this.

On the 9th, an incident of a man bullying a woman occurred, becoming the first gossip news in Guilin this year. The female protagonist, Zhou Jinghui, is of medium build, wears glasses, and studied Chinese literature at the Great China University. The male protagonist, Qin Shuji, is the head of the First Section of the Municipal Government, not much different in age from the woman, looking about 32 or 33 years old. This pair of "happy enemies" met in the summer six years ago, and soon Zhou became Qin's "Anti-Japanese War wife." Qin had a wife and ignored Zhou, and then had an affair with a woman surnamed Xiong. The second year after the restoration, Zhou Jinghui traveled thousands of miles to find her husband, bringing her nearly four-year-old daughter from Zhejiang. They met with displeasure, and the quarrel was so intense that there was no hope of reconciliation. The mayor's mediation did not have much effect either. Qin, who played with women, was so angry that he did everything he could, in addition to beating him, and instigated his girlfriend to seduce Zhou into remarrying. When remarriage failed, Qin gave Zhou a "red hat," saying: "Some people say you are a spy, and now you are being watched." Zhou could not bear it any longer and had to complain to the newspaper and appeal to society for help.

"Weak, your name is woman." In this society, Zhou Jinghui's experience may be very ordinary.

Here is another piece of women's news: The female workers of the Southwest Textile Factory requested a day off from the factory on "March 8th," but the result was that the entire factory went on strike. The factory asked the guarantors to take the workers back, saying that "the female workers took the excuse of the "March 8th" Festival, stopped work without authorization, and instigated other female workers to take the same action. After the factory director and foreman persuaded them to go to work, they refused to obey. Please ask the guarantor to take them back." Afterwards, the factory fired three female workers, and the rest submitted letters of repentance and resumed work.

### Indonesian Chinese Suffer Heavy Losses

[Report from This Newspaper in Batavia on the 2nd] Since the Dutch Indonesian army launched its second police action in Java and Sumatra on December 19 last year, although a ceasefire was reached on January 5, Indonesian militia have continued to conduct guerrilla warfare in various places and destroy towns and traffic.

According to an investigation by Wu Yuwen, consultant of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the National Government, the number of overseas Chinese who have been brutally killed by Indonesian rioters in this incident has reached more than a thousand, and about 20,000 have been rounded up and kidnapped by Indonesian militia. Although several thousand people have been rescued by the Dutch army, the whereabouts of others are still unknown, and their lives and deaths are uncertain. More than 40,000 refugees in Java and Sumatra are currently being provided relief by the various Chinese General Associations.

### Ministry of Finance Instructions Arrived: Gold Trade Association Prepares to Resume Business, Association Notifies Members to Register Immediately

[Our Dispatch] The Ministry of Finance's instructions allowing members of the Shanghai Gold Trade Association to resume business were delivered to Xu Fusun, a leader of the industry, by the Ministry of Finance at around 5:00 PM on the 11th. He was instructed to promptly notify fellow members to handle the resumption of business as soon as possible, so that formal operations could be restored within the next week.

The Gold Trade Association held a meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon at around 5:00 PM, chaired by Acting Chairman Zhao Zhongying. More than ten directors and supervisors attended. After discussion, it was generally agreed that before the number of members and the situation were fully understood, it would be inappropriate to rush into resuming business. It was decided to draft a notice to members to register for resumption of business immediately, to be published in various newspapers. The full text is as follows:

"According to the Ministry of Finance's order to investigate and open up the financial reform case, the trading of gold is now permitted. To facilitate trading and ensure normal prices, the original members of the association should be allowed to resume business. The association is hereby ordered to promptly convene all member businesses to properly plan a sound organization, and to submit a plan for spot gold trading to the Ministry for approval, so that an order can be issued for the resumption of business on a fixed date." The association will comply accordingly. From today onwards, member gold businesses are required to register for resumption of business, so that the report can be submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for review and approval as soon as possible.

According to Xu Fusun, the association originally had 168 members. It remains to be seen how many are willing to prepare to resume business after registration. He made it clear that this resumption of business refers to the resumption of business by members of the Gold Trade Association, not the resumption of business of the Gold Exchange, and the latter is currently impossible. The last time the Gold Trade Association members resumed business was a short period from March 1946 to February 8, 1947, almost two years ago.

[Our Dispatch] Finance Minister Xu Kan met with reporters at the National Bank yesterday and stated that the open gold and silver market will be established as soon as next week (i.e., this week). The Central Bank is currently studying concrete plans and has ordered the Shanghai Gold Trade Association to draft gold trading regulations. In the future, trading will be limited to spot transactions. As for the chairman of the association, he will be elected by the association itself, and the Ministry of Finance will not interfere. He then stated firmly that the new financial plan promulgated this time will be implemented to the end, and he believes that the power of speculators will never be able to oppose the government. Finally, when reporters asked whether he would continue to serve as finance minister in He Yingqin's new cabinet, he firmly replied, "I definitely don't want to do it again this time!"

### Fluctuating Trend of Chinese Stocks, Market Starts High and Ends Low

[Our Dispatch] The Chinese stock market experienced significant volatility and a fluctuating trend yesterday. In the morning, all stocks opened at a high level, and the market was firm in the middle. However, a sudden reversal occurred near the close, resulting in a rise. Initially, benefiting from the easing of overnight credit conditions, the supply of funds was relatively strong, and the implicit interest rates within the industry declined, improving market sentiment and boosting buying interest. Subsequently, the price of gold plummeted, weakening market sentiment, and the market fell sharply. Yong Yarn opened at a high of 6.01 yuan due to the large traders' deliberate manipulation. The bulls took the opportunity to sell at a high price, briefly falling to 5.78 yuan. However, due to lower interest rates and rising gold prices, yarn, cloth, and securities were actively bought, reaching the limit. Trading was suspended and reopened several times, with a firm trend. Around noon, rumors spread that the Central Bank was selling gold in large quantities, causing a sharp decline in gold prices. Outside investors in silk yarn and cloth unanimously plunged, and floating longs turned short, weakening the market, falling to 5.52-5.48. After the decline, financial stocks were slightly bought, and the market slightly recovered. However, due to the large allocation of gold, credit became scarce near the close, and the overall trend was completed, closing at 5.56, up 10%.

Under the same trend at the morning opening, small and medium-sized stocks were generally healthy. Meiya, Xinyi, Jingfu, Shanglian, and Yonggong once hit their limit. Therefore, except for a slight increase at the end of the low, the rest were mediocre.

Foreign Stocks Rise

The foreign stock market started high and ended low yesterday. Initially, the foreign exchange market price rose, and the gold trend was still good. Furthermore, due to Saturday, there was constant give and take between bulls and bears. E-Silk first reached 12,300 yuan, then fell to 11,100 yuan, 11,400 yuan. Asia 1120 yuan, British Union 12,500 yuan, 13,500 yuan. Jardine Matheson 33,000 yuan, 36,000 yuan. Each stock rose by about half a percentage point.

Gold Bonds Prosper

[Our Dispatch] The spot market for gold public bonds looked good at the opening yesterday, and market sentiment was prosperous. Initially, there was a demand for 160,000, and the securities helped to accept it, and the market rose. It stood at a high of 170,000, and finally closed at 175 million. The market is closed due to Saturday.

### Under Strict Investigation by the Gold Control Bureau, the Situation of Returned Checks Improves

Under the strict investigation by the Financial Control Bureau, the situation of returned checks on the 11th has been greatly reduced compared to the past. According to the Clearing House, more than 330,000 checks were exchanged on the 11th. Among them, there were 2,341 returned checks, a decrease of about 2,000 compared to the past. The total amount of returned checks was 231.7 million yuan, a decrease of about 1.8 billion compared to the past. However, the settlement was not completed until 9:00 PM. According to the Financial Control Bureau, the increase in returned checks was entirely due to the abuse of overdraft checks by customers in various banks and financial institutions. Therefore, the focus of this investigation will be on checking the accounts of suspected customers, followed by the accounts of the banks and financial institutions themselves.

In addition, the Financial Control Bureau has also been investigating state-owned banks and bureaus since yesterday and is continuing to investigate in detail today. According to reporters, if there are illegal loans or overpayments in the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury, the managers and supervisors will be reported by the bureau and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for strict handling.

### Rice Prices Rose Madly Yesterday, White Rice Called as High as 30,000 Yuan, Flour Rose Sharply by 20%, and Cooking Oil Prices Soared

Yesterday, the rice market experienced another sharp rise. With the easing of credit, market sentiment suddenly became firm, and everyone was bullish. Moreover, the price of gold and other items had risen compared to the previous day, and the cargo owners strongly pulled up the price, causing the market to surge. In the northern rice market, white rice and thin rice both reached 37,000 yuan, with the former rising by 7,000 yuan and the latter rising by 7,500 yuan. Special rice approached the 30,000 mark, opening at 29,000 yuan. In the southern rice market, white rice and early thin rice each rose sharply by 7,000 yuan, and Nanjing glutinous rice opened at 33,000 yuan. Retail white rice had reached the 40,000 mark, all rising by more than 20%. The total arrival of goods in the two markets was 5,158 shi.

Cooking Oil The rising trend became even more intense. With the easing of credit, cargo owners strongly pulled up the price, and retail investors rushed in, causing prices to soar by 20%. Soybean oil once reached a high of 154,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil once reached 147,000 yuan. At the close, floating longs sold, and prices slightly fell. Soybean oil closed at 147,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil closed at 143,000 yuan, each rising by 22,000 to 23,000 yuan, a rise of about 20%. Dasheng and Jingsheng oil reached a high price of 192,000 yuan, and soybean cake rose by 2,000 yuan.

Flour The market surged. At the opening, due to the two-day interest rate, the northern gang bought in large quantities with the easing of credit, and the cargo owners took the opportunity to try their best to pull up the price. Moreover, with the leadership of rice prices, market sentiment was unusually firm. Bingchuan reached a high of 15,080 yuan, and Laoche once reached a high of 15,700 yuan. Bran sales were also smooth, rising by about 20%. Large bags are now trading at 12,300 yuan.

Grains The market unleashed a fierce rising trend. With the source of peanuts nearing depletion, cargo owners held on tightly, and the market supply could not meet demand. Yangzhou peanuts rose sharply by 30%, reaching a high of 95,000 yuan, and the delivery price broke the 100,000 mark. Soybeans rose sharply by 20%. Later, due to the weakening of oilseed cakes, they fell back by 1,000 yuan. Green beans retreated to the 30,000 mark. Corn rose by 20%, and white sesame seeds quickly knocked on the 70,000 mark.

### The National Bank Continued to Allocate and Sell Gold Yesterday, at 325,000 per tael

[Our Dispatch] The National Bank continued to allocate and sell gold to the silver shop industry yesterday. At around 10:00 AM, the allocation price was announced at 325,000 yuan per tael. The total application from various silver shops reached more than 1,900 taels, and all were allocated. However, the application time was brought forward to 12:00 PM due to yesterday being a weekend. The price of gold jewelry quoted by various silver shops in the morning was 340,000 yuan. After 12:00 PM, the price of gold gradually decreased, and the price of gold jewelry was also quoted slightly lower at 330,000 yuan. The listed price of gold bars was 331,500 yuan.

The gold note market initially looked good yesterday morning due to the unexpected easing of credit, and buying interest was still strong. However, the floating longs were afraid of a rebound and immediately sold at a high price, and the shorts were very cautious and made up for it at a slightly lower price. Trading in the morning was still strong, opening high and then holding firm. At noon, the Central Bank strongly sold, softening the market, resulting in a low closing. The overnight longs suffered huge losses. The morning opening continued the bullish momentum of the previous day and the still-easing credit. Retail longs bought, and the initial price was 333,000 yuan, 338,000 yuan. After the opening, the market hovered, without showing prosperity or decline. After 11:30, the Central Bank strongly sold, falling to 295,000 yuan, 298,000 yuan. After the fall, retail shorts made up for it, and the morning market ended with a good rebound at 305,000 yuan, 308,000 yuan. In the afternoon, credit turned scarce, but there was no formal trading on Saturday, and with two days of interest, the Monday position was quoted at 348,000 yuan, 353,000 yuan.

The U.S. dollar opened at 6,650 yuan, 6,750 yuan in the morning. It hovered slightly in the middle, and near noon, it plunged with the collapse of gold.

### Market Walk A Viewer's Stand

The Five Throws Down Achieve Great Results "Setting Fire to Save Fire" is the Same Person

Last night on Financial Street, the atmosphere was tense, and many banks and financial institutions had liquidity problems and were teetering. The Central Bank took on the responsibility of the bank of banks, opened the door for a night market, accepted these shaky banks and financial institutions, and exchanged them for liquidity at 3 million yuan per gold bar, even though the Central Bank's gold allocation price yesterday morning was 3.25 million yuan.

In recent weeks, the market on Saturday afternoons has mostly risen sharply. Yesterday, however, there was an exceptional sharp drop. After 6:00 PM, the implicit interest rate was as high as 2 yuan 5 jiao, which can be said to be unprecedented. More wonderfully, after the market opened yesterday morning, all markets were rejoicing. Of course, the Central Bank's gold allocation price first rose from 290,000 yuan to 325,000 yuan, and the exchange certificate also rose to 5,600 yuan, so how could market sentiment not be excited?

Who knew, everyone had thrown themselves into the net.

Not long after 10:00 AM, news suddenly spread in all markets that the authorities were selling off real goods.

Selling gold, selling U.S. dollars, selling yarn, selling sugar, selling exchange certificates, five throws down, the momentum was huge, and everyone was frightened. The stock market rose sharply and fell quickly, the gold note fell sharply, and from then until late at night, it was all in a gloomy storm.

In the anti-fascist war, "strike the striker"

In the anti-speculation war? Come and "speculate on the speculator"!

Isn't that right? Hang up a high price first, then hit it head-on, although it's close to speculation, there's really no need to be polite to speculators.

In this blow, if speculators are crushed, no one will sympathize with them. The question is: What contribution does it make to stabilizing people's livelihood?

Take yesterday's tight and stormy market as an example, the major commodities closely related to people's livelihood, such as rice, oil, flour, cloth, coal, and imported goods, were not affected by this blow and still rose sharply.

The commodity market is originally not as sensitive as the speculative financial market. It is reasonable that when hitting the speculative financial market, it may not affect the commodity market for a while. Because of this, this offensive should not be a temporary gratification but should be a long-term resistance plan. Then the rumored preparations for the gold and silver market not only do not show any preparation to eradicate speculation but also have a tendency to indulge speculation. Then, can this kind of measure yesterday not make people feel that "setting fire to save fire is the same person"?

### Cotton Yarn Initially Firm and Then Pulled Back, Cloth Market Slightly Relaxed Near the Close

Yesterday, the yarn market continued to report a show of strength. The credit situation in the market was slightly looser, market sentiment was floating, and Cantonese transactions were lively. The finishing industry was also particularly interested in fine yarn. All yarns opened high, so boiled red and other goods also reported gains. The street was particularly smooth in its search and absorption, and new peaks emerged one after another. Near noon, news came that the National Bank was selling gold indefinitely, and the circle of people forced the price down unanimously, so the rising trend was not sustained, and it turned sharply downwards, finally closing with a soft position, but still rising more than before.

42-count Blue Phoenix was called directly from 2.65 million yuan to 2.8 million yuan. Near the close, there were many floating households selling out, and the price immediately returned to 2.57 million yuan, finally rising by 280,000 yuan. 40-count and 32-count each rose by 200,000 yuan to 250,000 yuan. The spot price of 21-count Double Horse was shouted from 1.3 million yuan to 1.36 million yuan, and finally it was 1.265 million yuan, rising by 120,000 yuan. All grades below 20-count rose by about 150,000 yuan.

The price of cotton cloth rose back unanimously, which was a good thing. With the easing of credit, the buying wind restarted, and local customers reached out frequently. In the morning, under the holding of those who held the goods, each cloth station stood at a high level. Then, there were still loose hands, and it was slightly relaxed near the close.

Fine cloth opened at 46,700 yuan and once reached a high of 47,600 yuan. In the afternoon, although the outside market saw a high of 50,000 yuan (delivery on Monday), it was still not enough for two days' interest compared to the afternoon closing. The price of loudspeaker fine cloth rose by 5,400 yuan, and other fine cloths such as Yinyue and Baobei also showed a rising trend.

Sijunzi plain serge opened at 45,500 yuan, reached a high of 45,700 yuan, and finally was 44,900 yuan, rising by 4,400 yuan. In the afternoon, there were slight transactions at 49,000 yuan. Sijunzi white-printed plain serge was priced at 39,800 yuan, and 190 high-end Shilin knocked on the 100,000 yuan mark. Floral serge rose to 50,000 yuan.

### Financial Control Bureau Approved Three Applications Yesterday to Use Increased Capital Cash

[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Financial Control Bureau continued to receive more than 50 applications from banks and financial institutions to use the transferred increase in capital cash. The bureau held its 19th review meeting with the Business Bureau and Audit Office of the National Bank on the morning of the day before yesterday, reviewed each case, and approved the use of funds by three new banks and financial institutions, totaling about 200,000 yuan. The rest were applications for renewal.

### The Authorities Have Other Ways to Combat Speculative Behavior

Cooperate with the Sale Policy

[Our Dispatch] The person in charge of the National Bank's Business Bureau told reporters yesterday that since the National Bank has successively sold and allocated gold, the prices of financial goods in the city have been relatively stable. It is believed that the situation will be even better starting next week. However, it is not enough to suppress general prices by controlling the prices of financial goods alone. Therefore, the authorities have now drafted another method, which, after being coordinated with the National Bank's sale and allocation of gold and materials, will be able to severely crack down on speculators.

### Silver Dollar Vendors Concentrate Business

Since the free buying and selling of gold and silver has been permitted, silver dollar vendors have gathered on various roads in the city, which not only affects the appearance of the city but also hinders traffic. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters specially ordered the Municipal Police Bureau yesterday to designate locations and order silver dollar vendors to concentrate their business. The bureau has instructed its subordinate departments to comply and has limited the number of vendors in the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts due to heavy traffic. Other districts have been designated suitable locations by the sub-bureaus to concentrate operations.

### Yuan Calculation of Tariffs

Decision to Implement from the 15th

[Our Dispatch] The Jianghai Customs' regulations for calculating import duties in customs yuan have been officially announced and will be implemented from March 15th. All customs duties levied by customs offices throughout the country should be paid in customs yuan converted by importers from that date.

### 36-Year U.S. Dollar Bonds

Principal and Interest Converted at the Market Price of the Transfer Certificate

The principal and interest of the 36-year U.S. dollar bonds are paid in U.S. dollar foreign exchange according to the regulations. Since the issuance of the gold yuan, although the bonds have been stipulated to be repaid according to the original regulations, according to the Measures for the Handling of Gold, Silver and Foreign Currencies Owned by the People, the U.S. exchange received for matured principal and interest should be deposited into the Central Bank in accordance with the Foreign Currency Foreign Exchange Deposit Measures for use in accordance with the regulations, or converted into gold yuan at the exchange rate (i.e., one to twenty).

It is now heard that in order to protect the interests of the bondholders, the Ministry of Finance has approved the payment method for the principal and interest of this bond due on March 1st of this year. In addition to still being used as a foreign currency foreign exchange deposit, if the bondholder requests to exchange gold yuan, or after being transferred to a foreign currency foreign exchange deposit, requests to exchange gold yuan, permission is granted to change the conversion to the Central Bank's purchase price of the foreign exchange transfer certificate on the date of the request for exchange.

### Aviation Gasoline Price Increase

[Our Dispatch] Aviation gasoline rose again by 16% yesterday. The Shanghai price is now 3,570 yuan per gallon. This is the second price increase since the adjustment of aviation freight rates on February 18.

Market Price List

### Fellow Traders Withdraw Orders En Masse; Money Market Strangely Tight in the Afternoon

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the money market opened rather calmly, with interbank rates ranging between seventy and eighty yuan. Although there were over twenty billion yuan in settlements for cotton cloth and sugar, remittances from other locations and disbursements from the national treasury flowed out successively, offsetting the former, resulting in a deceptively tight money market that appeared relaxed. Around noon, ten minutes before the gold market closed, news suddenly broke that the National Bank had entrusted a certain gold firm to dump a large quantity of gold, reportedly numbering in the thousands of bars, with one account mentioning four to five hundred large bars. The money market immediately tightened. After 3:00 PM, an unprecedented tightness was observed, with interbank rates soaring to one hundred and fifty yuan. Around 4:00 or 5:00 PM, fellow traders were withdrawing orders in droves, with interbank rates remaining stubbornly around one hundred and forty yuan. Finally, it was heard that financial authorities, in order to regulate the head positions of fellow traders, were using gold priced at 300,000 yuan per tael, US dollars at 6,000 yuan, and foreign exchange certificates at 5,400 yuan, to offset the missing orders. Therefore, after 6:00 PM, the money market began to loosen, and interbank rates retreated to the 100 yuan level. Yesterday, the National Bank's frequent settlements of overnight cotton cloth, sugar, and foreign exchange transfer certificates resulted in an unprecedentedly large deficit of 32,655,000,000+ yuan. Foreign merchants and banks had a surplus of over 190,000,000 yuan, large clearing houses had a deficit of over 10,140,000,000 yuan, and small clearing houses also had an unprecedented surplus of over 40,880,000,000 yuan.

### Railway vs. China Aviation: Decisive Battle Today; Whose Will Be the Mayor's Cup? Contributions on Attacking and Defending Strategies for Both Teams

[Report from Our Newspaper] The fourth Mayor's Cup football match, Railway versus China Aviation, is scheduled for the championship final today at 3:00 PM at the Yiyuan Stadium. The Football Committee has specially invited Mayor Wu to the venue to kick off the match and personally award the Mayor's Cup. A reporter from Shanghai Broadcasting Station will be present to broadcast the battle situation live starting at 3:00 PM. Order at the stadium will be maintained by the Siwei Boy Scouts. Ticket prices for today's match remain the same, at 600 yuan and 400 yuan. The Mayor's Cup football match, which began three weeks ago, will conclude successfully today. Today's referee is Zhang Le, and the linesmen are Ni Xiaoben and Lu Shunzong.

Railway originally harbored ambitions to win the league championship, but their aspirations were thwarted by Qingbai. Now that Qingbai has been eliminated, and their major enemy is gone, this is a golden opportunity. They will inevitably do their best to win this cup. Judging from Railway's recent form, there is hope of touching the championship trophy. Railway's only special feature is the stable and reliable third inner guard, Gao Baozheng. The whole team adopts skillful short passes, with Zhang Jie's charges and Lu Qingxiang's headers. In defense, Gao Baozheng supports it all alone. Ren Xiaowei buys up a good position but lacks hard feet. Jiabang is brave but moves slowly. The midfielders are good at supplying but not good at stealing. The wingers cannot fly. If China Aviation's offense avoids strength and seeks weakness, focusing on cutting in on both wings, combined with a central breakthrough strategy, forcing Baozheng into passivity and luring him away from his home ground, Railway may suffer a serious threat. To restrain the activities of China Aviation's forwards, they should be resisted in the midfield. The young players are brave and fast enough. Once they break free, they are like a runaway horse, charging straight ahead, which will be terrifying. Railway's short passes are indeed lovely, so both wings should increase speed and intelligence to make up for the forwards' slow weaknesses. Hesitation in shooting is a flaw. It is important to seize the opportunity and catch the goalkeeper off guard to have a chance to break through Fu Sheng's iron gate. Therefore, Railway's victory or defeat depends on the form of its forwards. Because there is Baozheng in the defense, there is still hope. "Attack is the best defense." Strengthening the attack can reduce the threat to the defense. If they can score the first goal and establish their authority, they can be confident of victory.

If China Aviation borrows players from Hong Kong, they can defeat Railway. If they field the original team, they can also threaten them. The young players have been training hard for the past two weeks, with soaring ambitions. Some people say, "The young players beating Qingbai is just doing the work for someone else, it's all in vain." But the young players say it well, they are not working for others, but hoping to wear this yellow robe themselves. This is the young players' ambition, and there should be a fierce battle with Railway.

China Aviation's lineup should be very cautious. Both wings must fly together, so Xu Zuguog must be used as a winger. Since both wings must fly together, Gao Xiuqing should take the responsibility of completing the final breakthrough with a central breakthrough, while Yin Qingbing and Chen Yuwei serve as inner forwards. Xiuqing is good at shooting and is in very good shape. The center forward's position is prominent, and there are more opportunities to shoot. The midfielders are average, relying on their fighting spirit. If they steal the ball, they must send it out to the forwards with a long kick. Railway uses short passes, and the midfielders must also advance away from defense to assist the attack, so that their midfielders cannot return to defense, and China Aviation can grasp the initiative of the attack. Therefore, there must be long kicks to send the forwards to a firm place. If relying solely on dribbling to deliver the ball, then it will be slow, and Railway's midfielders will have returned to defense, and can calmly deploy to meet the attack.

Xie Xichuan is the only one who is good at headers. Xiao Ziping must keep a close eye on Xiao Ziwen. Shang Huajun will not easily suppress Lu Qingxiang's headers. Chuan Han also will not easily block Zhang Jie's movements. If you want to reduce the threat of headers, you must prevent crosses from both wings. To restrain Zhang Jie's movements, you must firmly nail Xiao and Lu's inner forward activities. The first priority is to resist Railway's offensive, then you can break through its defense. China Aviation must also show a fighting spirit to deal with this great battle. Luck is also a factor in winning. China Aviation has narrowly survived twice, is it blessed? (Qi Gong)

### China United Defeats Sea Green; Leads All the Way; Intense Enthusiasm in the Indoor Basketball Court

[Report from Our Newspaper] In the basketball league, China United "Smooth Sailing" defeated Sea Green 55-42 last night. The score was 38-18 in the first half. The audience roared with excitement. In the first half, China United's crazy offensive, with five players scoring evenly, was clean and clear. Each performance was satisfying, and China United had a clear advantage. In the second half, there were widespread substitutions, and Sea Green began to have a chance to compete. In the women's group, Xinghua defeated Li Team 38-14, with the score being 18-9 in the first half. In Grade 2B, Post and Telecommunications defeated Hezhong 55-30, with the score being 24-19 in the first half.

Last night, China United used Fu Jinsheng, Wu Chengzhang, Liu Fushan, Li Zhenzhong, and Bao Songyuan to deal with Sea Green. After the game started, Jin Sheng missed a free throw, and Kirkel immediately reported a goal. Zhenzhong received the ball under the basket on this side and sent it into the basket on the other side. Chuan Bao added two more goals, and the momentum was magnificent at 6-2. Bao and Paikes Keikel each added one goal. At this time, Sea Green already had three blacks and two whites, and the lineup changed.

Zhenzhong's long shot, Gibson's secret arrow, and Wu Chuanliu's endless attacks. After ten minutes, the other side became two blacks and three whites. Chengzhang's stealing "leftovers" and Liu Chuanbao's crazy attacks were cheered by the audience.

Little black carbon Pannock scored a goal and shook his head. Bulunhuo scored and was called out. Paikes, the darkest among them, also aimed at the basket and threw it. The team scored three goals in a row, and soon the score became 33-18, and China United's prestige was slightly frustrated. However, Songyuan's long strides increased Sea Green's burden. In the first half, China United was 38, and Sea Green was 18, and the number of wins and losses was already determined.

After the break, there were slight adjustments. China United replaced Zhenzhong and Jinsheng with Le Jiazhou and Zhang Liangxiong. China United committed its first foul in the second half, which shows that their psychology was not nervous. Sea Green's spirit of not giving up for Bulunhuo Gibson, and the three black carbon balls following the enemy, were inseparable. 46-25, Sea Green gradually improved, and soon Hanting replaced Fushan. 50-25, China United committed its second foul. Sea Green's never giving up, China United finally won 55-42, not much difference.

### Olympic Female Champion (3): Biography of Mrs. Koen, the Flying General of Holland

— Translated by Ding Xin

Mrs. Koen is teaching her son "Little Jan" and her daughter "Little Fanny" to brush their teeth.

Fanny is indeed working hard on her practice. Except for a few months of suspension during her two pregnancies, she has never interrupted her training over the years. During the war, there were no international masters for her to compete with. The female athletes from Holland were unwilling to race with her as she ran like a wild, unbridled horse. In anger, Fanny decided to compete with the men. At a sports meet in 1943, Fanny actually signed up to join the men's group and finished the 100 meters in 11.5 seconds, ranking fourth, actually beating two other muscular men.

It was not until 1946 that Fanny had a chance to show her strengths. At the European Championships in Oslo, Norway, despite being less than seven months postpartum and having a sprained ankle in the 100-meter final, Fanny not only overwhelmed the women in the 80-meter hurdles, but also won first place for the Dutch relay team.

At the 14th World Games last year, Fanny experienced the most dangerous and tense scene. This time, even Jan, who has always been calm, and still serves as the head coach of the Dutch delegation, was a little beside himself. It was the 80-meter hurdles final at 3:00 PM on August 4th. Fanny, who had won the 100-meter title two days earlier with 11.9 seconds, was now going to compete against Miss Katerina, "Britain's hope." The beautiful Miss Katerina is only 19 years old and is a dance teacher at Oxford University. British newspapers were saying, "Fanny Koen has no hope of winning, she is too old."

Just as the other five athletes were concentrating on the track, waiting for the starting signal, Fanny suddenly froze and did not even hear the gunshot. By the time the other five had run close to the first hurdle, she instinctively woke up and started running frantically forward. But her steps, faster than a wild hare, were still able to catch up with the other racers, and she reached the finish line at the same time as Katerina.

It was impossible to distinguish with the naked eye who was ahead, Fanny or Katerina. Before the film taken by the electric camera at the white line was developed, suddenly, the band played the British national anthem, and the stands erupted in cheers. Impatient reporters and racers in the arena rushed to congratulate Katerina. Even Katerina herself was gloating over being able to win the first gold medal for her country. Over there, Fanny, crestfallen, was looking for Jan, preparing to apologize to him. Suddenly, the official results were announced: Although Fanny and Katerina broke the world record with 11.2 seconds, the film showed that Fanny was the first to reach the finish line. Katerina had to settle for second place by a nose. Only then did Fanny realize that the band's performance and the audience's shouts were originally welcoming the British Emperor and Empress, who had come uninvited to the conference.

Driven by a sense of responsibility, Fanny still apologized to Jan. Because she had a record of 11 seconds flat in practice in Amsterdam earlier in the year, if she hadn't started too slowly, she might have run under 11 seconds, so there would have been no need for Jan and herself to worry.

Two days later, Fanny won the 200-meter title with a record of 24 seconds, eclipsing Mildred "Babe" Didrikson Zaharias, who won the javelin and hurdles events in the 1932 Los Angeles Games and another second place. Winning three gold nuggets alone also wrote a new page in Olympic history.

Before the end of the conference, Fanny, like a locomotive, pulled the already lagging Dutch relay team, surpassing the other five women's teams. She and the oddball Jesse Owens, who created a record of winning four honorary awards in the 1936 Berlin Games, shined successively.

Invitations for Fanny to perform flew in like snowflakes from major cities around the world. The Blankers family was also happy to accept. Last September, Fanny tied her own 80-meter hurdles record in Finland with 11.2 seconds. This spring, Fanny, Jan, and their two children boarded a plane again for their first long journey outside of Europe, flying to Australia.

Fanny rarely has more than two minutes of free time at home. Almost all of her time is spent running back and forth between the kitchen and the dining room. In addition, she serves Jan and her two children. She gets up at 7:30 in the morning. After preparing breakfast, she has to wash and dress the children. Just coaxing them to brush their teeth, this Dutch mother has to mess around for a while. After sending the older children to school, tidying up the beds and sweeping the house, she takes her two-year-old daughter to the vegetable market to buy what she is allowed to buy with ration coupons - one pair of eggs every two weeks per person, one pound of cheese a month, and meat that is only available on weekends. Fortunately, green vegetables and onions are no longer rationed. (During the German occupation, you had to queue up for bread at 5:00 AM every morning!)

The afternoon is for washing and mending, and most of the time is spent knitting wool clothes. Most of the clothes for the two children and herself are handmade by her.

Dinner is around 7:00 PM, and after dinner, if friends come, they play bridge and chat. Otherwise, they use reading for recreation. They live such an ordinary life.

Jan's annual salary at the police station is 5,000 guilders (approximately $1,850). He also earns more than 2,000 guilders a year for writing for several newspapers. He is also a good reporter! During the London Games, he sent telegraphs and wrote dispatches for a major Dutch newspaper. When Fanny defeated Katerina, he reported: "The world's best hurdler won a victory by a hair's breadth. The tension and danger of the situation have not yet allowed the reporter's pulse to return to normal."

As punctual as a clock, Fanny practices twice a week for two hours each time at the Olympic Stadium to maintain her level. "Her posture," Jan said, "is impeccable, except that her fingers are slightly stiff (see the close-up of her fingers at the end of the 100 meters published on the 11th). But in fact, Fanny's stiff fingers and her pre-competition timidity are not a problem. To date, Fanny Koen holds five world records - 100 meters, 100 yards, 80 meters hurdles, high jump (1.71 meters), and long jump (6.25 meters). [End of full text]

### On Indexing Books

— Jiang Yu

When reading Western books, especially those in the social sciences, one thing that impresses me the most is the accuracy and completeness of their indexing work. After reading, one can always use the index at the back to quickly find information and use it forever. It is said that even for voluminous works such as the complete works of Shakespeare, someone has created extremely detailed indexes, with accurate statistics and annotations on how often a certain word is used, how often it is not used, and how many times a certain word is used. This kind of dedication is truly amazing. Culture is the accumulation of thousands of years of human effort, and it is because of the contributions of these people that the foundation of culture is strong and unshakable.

Of course, in-depth research on certain knowledge or certain works has also existed in our country since ancient times, and it is no worse than in foreign countries. The so-called "studying the classics until one's hair turns white" is an expression of this spirit. However, the result is often either drilling into the horns of a dilemma or just forming a reflection of one's own thoughts. It often fails to achieve the task of paving the way and building bridges for later researchers. There are many reasons for this, but the lack of importance, unscientific nature, and unsystematic nature of indexing work is one of the main problems.

In the past, our country had a long period of selecting scholars through imperial examinations, and the Four Books and Five Classics unknowingly turned the hair of many scholars white. But even for these classics that were required reading for scholars at the time, although there were many interpretations, there has never been any systematic indexing work that focuses on the matter at hand. In recent decades, many Chinese works on natural sciences and social sciences have also been published. Due to practical needs, some people have been willing to seriously do indexing work, but it is still far from the standard of usability. When we read a book, we always feel powerless to fully utilize all the material in it, which is a defect that urgently needs to be remedied.

Due to the nature of the language, it is easier to index and check foreign books, which is a fact. But this difficulty is not impossible to overcome. The problem is just how to find appropriate words to represent a certain idea or thought, and this method of representation must be commonly understood and accepted by the general public. It is difficult to enforce this rigidly. I think it is better to let it happen naturally. If every book and every author makes efforts in this direction, although there will inevitably be great differences at first, it will slowly merge into a path that everyone can use.

### Reading Machine for the Blind

— Shi Jiahao

The most distressed people in the world are deaf-mutes and the blind.

In various civilized countries in Europe and America, large sums of money have been specially allocated for these two kinds of pitiful people to run schools for the deaf-mute and the blind, and to implement special education, so that not only can deaf-mutes see and write like ordinary people, but even the blind can touch and read words and write letters using special books in Braille.

However, the books used by the blind must be specially made. Ordinary flat books cannot be used, which is a major shortcoming. Therefore, an American scientist named Nuom Baike recently invented a reading machine for the blind to remedy this shortcoming and benefit the blind all over the world.

With this machine, any bird book can be transformed into Braille and enlarged in a short period of time, so that the blind can touch and read it at will.

This machine is composed of two parts: broadcasting and printing. The broadcasting machine is specially used to irradiate the text on the book and transmit its image to the printing machine. The printing car in the printing machine travels horizontally from side to side on a thin lead plate, piercing dotted lines to form embossed text.

To preserve the text on the lead plate, the lead plate can be stored. Otherwise, the lead plate can be passed through two rotating cylinders, and the embossed text will be pressed off, and the lead plate can be used again next time.

The blind can use this machine freely after only one month of practice, and can touch and read any book.

### Orchid

— Song Renying

The author shamefully admits that he cannot secure the country with his writing or pacify the nation with his martial arts. In this chaotic world, he has to learn from the ancients and "write a painting of secluded orchids when the mood strikes, so as not to use money that creates sin in the world" to barely make a living. Now that spring orchids are in full bloom, the fresh and fragrant scent of several pots of orchids in the small garden, introduced by Mr. Feng, rushes into my nose in waves and penetrates my heart and lungs, making my worried brows relax and my troubles disappear. Walking closer to admire them, I feel like I am facing an old friend, like I am meeting a gentleman, and my feelings of joy and comfort are indescribable.

The ancients said, "Orchids are likened to gentlemen, and orchids are likened to scholars. Although the characters are different, the flavors are not different," which is certainly not a false statement.

Planting orchids is very difficult. The first task is to be timely, to measure the land and live in it, to follow its yin and yang, to fulfill its nature, to water and remove insects lightly, and to pay special attention.

Painting orchids is also very difficult. The beauty of writing orchids lies in the breath and charm first. The ink must be of fine quality, and the water must be clear spring water. The inkstone must be free of old dirt, and the brush must be pure and not hard. The hand must be like lightning, and there must be no delay. Flying on the paper, the dragon comes to life.

Zheng Suonan painted orchids without painting soil, because he was grieving over the loss of his country's territory. He was truly a patriotic man. He painted a scroll of orchids, more than a foot long and five or six inches high, with the inscription "Purely gentlemen, no villains at all," with profound intentions.

My humble work, "A Hundred Orchids", has already been inscribed with poems by dozens of famous people. Now, in order to reach a hundred, it will be printed into a book, and I am specifically soliciting inscriptions from major poetry circles at home and abroad. If you are willing to form an ink relationship and bestow your masterpieces, I would be very grateful.

### Extravagance, Cruelty, Corruption

— Yi Qun

In Xue Fucheng’s "Yong'an Notes," there is a passage recording the extravagant and decadent lives of the river management officials in Qingjiangpu (now Qinghe County, Jiangsu) during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty. Reading it truly makes one’s heart tremble.

Just talking about eating, one banquet was so lavish with bizarre and exotic delicacies that it lasted three days and three nights without ending, so no guest could eat until the end. They would always leave the table when the wine was low and the people were weary.

What kind of things did they eat? They were bizarre and utterly inhumane. It’s a wonder they could think of so many wonderful methods. For example, a bowl of so-called "team jerky" was made from the meat on the backs of dozens of fat pigs (discarding meat from other parts of the body). And these dozens of unlucky pigs were not dispatched quickly with a "white knife in, red knife out" ending their lives, but were beaten to death alive with bamboo sticks. Because it was said that pigs killed in this way had all their essence concentrated in their backs, making the back meat incomparably sweet and crisp.

For example, the so-called "goose palms" required dozens or hundreds of geese per banquet. The method was to drive flocks of geese onto red-hot iron sheets, forcing them to have nowhere to run and scalding them to death alive. Only the two palms of each goose were taken, and the rest was discarded. The reason was the same: geese killed by this "branding iron" method had their essence concentrated in their feet, and other parts were unfit for consumption.

For example, the so-called "camel hump" involved tethering healthy camels to pillars, pouring boiling water on their backs until they died. The essence was concentrated in the hump, so only the hump was cut off, and the entire camel was discarded. Three or four such camels were needed to make one banquet of camel hump.

For "monkey brains," a round hole was cut in the center of the dining table, and a monkey was placed under the table, its head protruding through the hole and secured with wood so it could not escape. The poor monkey's head was first shaved, then the scalp was peeled open, immediately followed by pouring hot soup over it, and simultaneously breaking the skull with an iron pestle. Thus, amidst cries of sorrow, guests could use silver spoons to scoop out and eat the brain matter.

Another example is "fish soup," made with large, live carp suspended upside down from the rafters, their heads smashed, and fresh blood dripping into a pot of boiling water below. The fish writhed in agony in the steam, twitching its head and tail until it died. Then, another fish was exchanged in. Dozens of fish were used to make one bowl of bloody fish soup.

See how extravagant and cruel this is! Precisely because it was so extravagant, they naturally had to rely on corruption to amass wealth in order to squander it. Precisely because it was so cruel, they fattened themselves at the expense of the people, and naturally, they were unscrupulous.

### After Watching "Love of the Sea"

— Qiao Long

At a time when Shanghai's stage plays are so desolate, it is indeed exciting to see a grand opera performed at the Lyceum Theatre.

I recall that purely Chinese operas have rarely been performed in Shanghai before. During the War of Resistance, there was a performance of "Qiu Zi" in Chongqing, but it was not very successful. The Yue Yi Society also previously performed a small opera, "Song of Shanghai," but it resulted in losses due to excessive expenses. Originally, the performance of a well-formed opera requires mobilizing significant manpower and resources, which is indeed a difficult matter in the current social economy of China.

As far as I know, the performance of "Love of the Sea" can also be described as a miracle. They had no reliable financial support at all. They overcame these economic difficulties solely through the cooperative efforts and hard work of many young artists dedicated to art.

Their symphony orchestra was performed by the Tsinghua Symphony Orchestra, which had just arrived from the Northeast, and purely on a voluntary basis.

The story of "Love of the Sea" is adapted from Loti's "An Iceland Fisherman", so even many of the names retain their Western flavor. The entire performance is also entirely modeled after the Italian opera style. Due to material constraints, the entire play uses only one set; changes in each act rely solely on lighting and sound effects to achieve the desired impact. The lighting design is very successful and can be said to have exhausted all possibilities in striving for the best effect. The transformation of the moonlit night and sunrise both exhibit superb techniques.

Sound is a very important part of opera performances. Here, the biggest shortcoming of the entire accompaniment is the lack of climactic performance. The entire accompaniment maintains a consistent level of stability. Because it is too stable, there is no contrast between high and low, so it is not easy to make people feel suffocated during tense moments in the plot.

The orchestra's accompaniment is generally not bad. However, the solo piano parts seem to be used too much. Of course, it is much simpler in terms of processing, but in terms of effect, apart from being used alone when accompanying monologues, other parts should be accompanied by symphonic harmonies, which are easier to produce results.

Miss Ye Ruzhen, the female lead, has a very good singing voice, with sufficient tone and volume to utilize. Zang Yuyan, the male lead, also has a decent voice. The solo parts of the second male lead, Li Mengxiong, seem to be a little worse, perhaps due to the unsuitable lyrics. Yang Huatang, who plays the father, seems to be a little too high in pitch, which doesn't coordinate well with the lower parts and often makes the listener feel tired.

Speaking not too strictly, this is a very worthwhile opera to see, especially if we can forgive the limitations of their economic situation.

### Western Humor

— Joke

A boss returned from a banquet, having heard a few jokes. Feeling very pleased with himself, he gathered all his subordinates in the office to tell them. All the subordinates laughed heartily after hearing them, except for one female typist who didn't laugh at all.

"What?" the boss asked. "Do you have no sense of humor at all?"

"I don't need to laugh," the female typist replied. "I've already resigned and I'm leaving tomorrow."

### Between Rise and Fall

— Wei

A small civil servant, worried about the soaring prices of goods these days, confided to his colleague:

"Everything is so expensive now, how can we small civil servants make a living?"

"Not necessarily, there is still one essential item that is falling sharply!"

"What?"

"That's the high-quality Gold Yuan Certificates produced in large quantities!" (Qu Que)
