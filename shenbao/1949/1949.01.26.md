### CCP Broadcast on Peace Proposals: Negotiation Location to Be in Beiping, CCP Representative Candidates Yet to Be Announced

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Political circles here learned on the evening of the 25th of the CCP spokesperson's comments on the peace talks issue, believing that the prospects for peace are quite promising. Although the spokesperson still had criticisms of the government, there was no indication of refusing to negotiate with the government. Acting President Li stated in his proclamation on the 22nd: "As for the eight conditions proposed by the CCP, the government is willing to begin discussions immediately." The CCP spokesperson also stated that they are willing to negotiate with the government on resolving the issue of peace on the basis of Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation on January 14th, which proves that the distance between the two sides is not too far. These individuals also pointed out that the two parties prove that the CCP spokesperson's remarks have indicated that negotiations can be conducted with the government. One is that it implies that the negotiation location will be in Beiping, which is almost a response to the Executive Yuan's resolution. The other is that they refused to receive Peng Zhaoxian as a peace talk representative, which implies that the CCP has no objection to the four representatives Shao, Zhang, Huang, and Zhong. However, regrettably, the CCP has not yet quickly and clearly announced the candidates for its delegation and explicitly designated Beiping as the negotiation location, so the government delegation cannot quickly go to Beiping to prepare for negotiations. However, another group of people felt slightly pessimistic about the CCP's response, because they believe that if both sides truly "bear with each other for the sake of the country," after the government has repeatedly expressed its determination to seek peace through actions, it should no longer criticize in a propaganda tone but should immediately take the current government as the target, quickly promote peace talks, stop the war, and rescue the people from suffering. However, they believe that the CCP's response did not mention Acting President Li's proclamation and the various measures announced on the 21st. If the CCP understands the government's new measures, it is believed that its attitude will change.

[United Press, This Location] The CCP radio station hinted on the evening of the 25th that the CCP agreed to start peace talks in Beiping, but this did not encourage government peace advocates. This is the first time the CCP has mentioned the relationship between Beiping and peace talks in response to the government's request for a negotiation location. At the same time, the CCP stated that not only is the first point of Mao Zedong's statement, the list of war criminals, impossible to compromise, but it will also be increased, which will make the government's peace efforts futile.

Government peace talk representative Shao Lizi stated: He has no time to carefully study the CCP broadcast on the evening of the 25th and cannot comment on it. All overall decisions must be made by the government. He also said: "However, after glimpsing the CCP document, he still hopes that the CCP will announce the confirmed location and time for the start of peace talks as soon as possible."

"He believes that the Communist Party should pay more attention to reducing the suffering of the people and less focus on calculating war criminals."

It is reported that if the Executive Yuan decides that the CCP's statement on the 25th is a true expression of Mao Zedong's inability to change his mind, Shao Lizi believes that he has no choice but to resign. It is also reported that Shao hopes that the government will not immediately interrupt its peace efforts and continue to seek any viable paths that have not yet been closed.

### CCP Spokesperson's Remarks: Full Text Broadcast by Xinhua Radio Station in Northern Shaanxi

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] After the government peace talk representatives were appointed, the CCP propaganda organ Xinhua News Agency broadcast on the 25th the CCP spokesperson's response to this matter. The Central News Agency reporter consulted an observer for their opinion on the content. According to the CCP spokesperson's statement, the CCP still lacks sincerity regarding the issue of comprehensive peace and intends to delay the progress of peace talks. The full text of the Xinhua News Agency broadcast is disclosed for discussion and judgment by the people of the whole country:

"Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: According to a report by the Central News Agency of the reactionary Nationalist government in Nanjing on the 22nd, the Executive Yuan of this reactionary government overturned on the 22nd its own absurd decision made on the 19th that it was unwilling to conduct negotiations without first ceasing fire, and re-decided to send five representatives to conduct negotiations with the Chinese Communist Party. These five representatives are Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Huang Shaohong, Peng Zhaoxian, and Zhong Tianxin. The CCP spokesperson stated: We are willing to negotiate with the reactionary government in Nanjing on the basis of Chairman Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation on January 14th to resolve the issue of peace. The reactionary government in Nanjing should bear full responsibility for launching the counter-revolutionary civil war. The people of the whole country have long completely lost trust in this government. This government is no longer qualified to represent the Chinese people. The only government qualified to represent the Chinese people is the democratic coalition government produced by the new political consultative conference to be convened without the participation of reactionary elements. Therefore, our permission for the reactionary government in Nanjing to send representatives to negotiate with us is not an acknowledgment that this government is still qualified to represent the Chinese people, but because this government still has some reactionary residual military power in its hands. If this government feels that it has completely lost the trust of the people and that its residual reactionary military power is no longer able to resist the powerful People's Liberation Army, and is willing to accept the eight peace conditions proposed by the CCP, then it is of course better and more beneficial to the cause of the people's liberation to resolve the problem through negotiation and reduce the suffering of the people. Recently, the peaceful resolution of the Beiping issue is an example. However, no one knows whether the reactionary government in Nanjing is willing to accept the eight conditions proposed by the CCP that reflect the public opinion of the people of the whole country. What is known now is that the reactionary government in Nanjing has released a lot of hypocritical and pretentious peace talk to deceive the people in order to achieve its goal of preserving reactionary forces, gaining a respite, and then making a comeback to extinguish the revolutionary forces. The people of the whole country should have a clear head and must not be confused by those hypocritical empty talks. The location of the negotiations will be determined only after Beiping is completely liberated, and it will probably be in Beiping. Peng Zhaoxian is one of the main cadres of the Kuomintang CC faction who is most supportive of war. People consider him a war criminal, and the CCP cannot receive such a representative. Regarding the issue of the list of war criminals, the CCP spokesperson stated that we have not yet published the full list of war criminals. What Xinhua News Agency published on December 25 last year was only the first batch of names. The main responsible persons in the Kuomintang reactionaries who launched the civil war and brutally murdered the people are definitely not limited to 43 people."

### President Inspects Old Residence: Meets with Clansmen and Elders

[Central News Agency, Xikou, 25th] President Chiang did not go out for sightseeing today. Around 3:00 PM, he drove to the Fenghao House old residence and inspected the surrounding area for a week. Chiang Ching-kuo brought his second son, Aimin, with him. They returned to the tomb hut around 4:00 PM. In addition, President Chiang has scheduled a banquet at the old residence on the evening of the 26th to entertain clansmen and elders in the town.

### Acting President Li Expresses to Four Supervisory Committee Members: Peace "Depends Entirely on Ourselves": It Can Be Achieved as Long as More Efforts Are Made

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Supervisory Committee members Gu Fengxiang, Ren Bingjun, He Junzhou, and Wang Xiangchen paid a visit to Acting President Li at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 25th. In addition to presenting the Supervisory Yuan's views on the current situation, they also discussed various issues related to the peace talks with the Acting President. It is reported that Acting President Li stated that the government is currently waiting for the CCP's response. After the location is determined, the government's first batch of representatives can go to conduct preliminary consultations on the peace talks. After the peace talks are widely launched in the future, the representatives sent by the government will naturally be insufficient to cope with the heavy workload, so people's representatives will be selected and sent one after another. The Acting President's confidence in peace is based on the attitude of "depending entirely on ourselves." The Acting President believes that as long as we make more efforts, peace can always be achieved. The four Supervisory Committee members stated after returning from their visit that they were satisfied with the Acting President's analysis of the current situation.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Legislators Yin Shuxian, Chen Bosheng, Fan Yushui, and others are currently planning to submit several fundamental principles related to peace talks to the government-appointed peace talk delegation for adoption. The recommendations are listed as follows: (1) Protect the people's freedom. (2) Guarantee national independence and territorial integrity. (3) Strengthen relations with the United States and the Soviet Union and avoid being drawn into a world war. (4) Integrate the Three Principles of the People and New Democracy as the theoretical foundation for national construction. The recommendations are expected to be sent out on the 26th.

### Li Pinxian Flies to Nanjing

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 25th] Li Pinxian, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Central China剿匪總司令部 (Bandit Suppression Headquarters), left Hankou by plane on the afternoon of the 24th to fly to Nanjing. It is reported that Li will represent Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi to consult with the central government. The rumors that Bai has already gone to Nanjing are actually a misinterpretation of Li's whereabouts.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison, returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 25th and immediately paid a visit to Acting President Li in the morning to report on the defense of the Yangtze River and make some requests.

### Yang Shouyuan Returns to Taiyuan

Had a Long Conversation with Acting President Li Before Departure

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Yang Aiyuan, Deputy Director of the Taiyuan绥靖公署 (Pacification Headquarters) stationed in Nanjing on behalf of Yan Xishan, returned to Taiyuan by plane at 9:00 AM on the 25th. Before returning to Taiyuan, Yang paid a visit to Acting President Li on the evening of the 24th and had a long conversation for about an hour.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 25th] Yang Aiyuan went to Nanjing in mid-October of last year during the fierce defense of Taiyuan. Now that his mission is completed, he flew back to Taiyuan from Nanjing by special plane on the afternoon of the 25th. According to Yang's statement to reporters, the central government has decided to provide a large amount of food and other supplies that Shanxi Province lacks.

### Tensions Increase Between Henan and Hubei: Communist Army Continues to Move in Wuyang and Fangcheng: Liu Bocheng's Troops Actively Plotting to Invade Shaanxi

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 25th] The situation in southern Henan and northern Hubei is slightly tense. A contingent of the Communist army under Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng continues to move towards Wuyang, Fangcheng, and Nanyang. The National Army is closely monitoring the situation, and there has been no major contact so far.

[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 25th] Military sources: It has been determined that the Communist army that fled back to southern Henan includes the 4th and 6th Columns, formerly under Liu Bocheng, and the 4th and 9th Columns under Chen Geng, which have recently been reorganized. A brigade of Liu's 6th Column has already fled to the Tongbai Mountains on the 21st. (2) According to a person in charge of the military, the Communist army's increased pressure on southern Henan is clearly aimed at threatening Wuhan. However, the soldiers and civilians in southern Henan are determined to uphold Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi's message of preparing for war while seeking peace, and firmly defend their positions to fulfill their important responsibility of protecting the territory and the people. Chairman Zhang Zhen of Henan Province went to Hankou today for official business.

[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 25th] Liu Bocheng's Communist army is actively plotting to invade Shaanxi. Its 61st and 22nd Brigades captured Hexipu, a county in northwestern Hubei, on the 22nd. The vanguard has reached Baofeng and intends to invade Ankang in southern Shaanxi.

### National Army Actively Withdraws to the Last Defense Line: Will Counterattack if the Communist Army Invades Further South: Spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense Issues Warning

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense stated on the 25th: Since the Executive Yuan resolved to unconditionally cease fire, the National Army automatically withdrew from Bengbu on the evening of the 19th. The Communist army continued to invade southwards. In order to comply with the government's decision to conduct peace talks and avoid further suffering for the people, the National Army withdrew from Chuxian on the 23rd and from Yangzhou on the evening of the 24th, and retreated to the north bank of the Yangtze River. The officers and soldiers of the National Army hope that the Communist army will also cease fighting and give the people a respite. The defense of the Yangtze River has been extremely consolidated after more than half a year of deployment. Our powerful navy, army, and air force, relying on the natural barrier of the Yangtze River, are confident of holding it firmly. It is still remembered that when the Ninghan split occurred in August of the 16th year of the Republic of China, the President also stepped down, and Sun Chuanfang invaded south with an army of more than 100,000. In the Battle of Longtan, the entire army was annihilated by our National Revolutionary Army. At that time, we only had the 1st and 7th armies and two small ships. Now the National Army has more than a dozen complete armies, with the cooperation of the air force. If the Communist army still violates the people's will for peace and continues to invade south, the National Army will give them a head-on blow. The Communist army will not escape the historical precedent, and its main force will be annihilated along the Yangtze River.

[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] Minister of National Defense Xu Yongchang warned the government that Nanjing will be able to hear the sounds of Communist army guns and artillery within five days. Acting President Li has transferred several divisions of reinforcements from neighboring provinces such as Anhui to defend the capital.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] In order to promote a quick ceasefire and peace talks between the two sides, the National Army in the southern section of the Jinpu Railway actively withdrew its main force to the south bank of the Chu River, the last defense line, and has now completed the most thorough deployment. The river is located north of the Huaqiying Railway Station, more than 30 li from Pukou and more than 40 li from Xiaguan. Even the Communist army's longest-range 15.6 cm heavy artillery cannot reach Xiaguan, let alone the city of Nanjing. Therefore, a military observer specially asked this reporter to tell the readers of this newspaper in Nanjing that there is no need to worry unnecessarily and disrupt our plans. As for the cities of Heshan and Quanjiao, since they are not within the last defense line that the National Army should defend, they were automatically evacuated on the evenings of the 22nd and 24th.

[Our Puzhen Dispatch, 25th] On the Jinpu Railway front, according to reports obtained on the evening of the 25th, only the New 1st and 12th Columns of Chen Yi's Communist army are on the north bank of the Huai River. The 6th, 9th, and 13th Columns are still being reorganized and there is no sign of them heading south. As for the main force of Liu Bocheng's army, they have long marched towards Central China via Mengcheng, while the main force of Chen Yi's army is in northern Jiangsu.

[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] There are currently two foreign warships docked in the river, one is the British warship "Black Swan" and the other is an American destroyer transport ship. According to the British and American embassies, the two ships are "prepared for necessary purposes."

### Yangzhou Evacuation Confirms Unclear Situation in Yizheng

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 25th] Confirmed: The garrison in the ancient city of Yangzhou, separated by one water, evacuated on the night of the 24th at 10:00 PM. Around 11:00 PM, a portion of the Communist army suddenly entered the city from the northern suburbs without encountering any resistance. At dawn on the 25th, the last group of personnel from the Yangzhou military and political organs safely arrived in the south by the Pujie wheel from Liuyi. Currently, the ferry is still operating overtime to Liuyi to load passengers and refugees who have not yet boarded the ship. It is expected to be fully loaded on the 26th, and then traffic in Zhenwei will be announced to be interrupted. The Jiangdu County government has set up a temporary office in Zhen, and organs such as the Commissioner's Office and the Suxi Division 管區 (Administrative District) have also moved to Zhen. According to people who came from Liuyi on the evening of the 25th, after the Communist army entered the city of Yangzhou, they ordered the Chamber of Commerce to organize merchant groups to maintain order. Currently, only one Fuyun Gate is open among the thirteen city gates of Yangzhou. The Communist army did not inspect the residents in the city. In addition, a company of the Communist army has advanced to the Shi Jiaqiao Highway between Yangzhou and Liuyi (15 li from the Liuyi river bank). Currently, the navy's river defense gunboats are closely monitoring their actions.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 25th] The situation in Yizheng was unclear on the morning of the 25th. Telegrams and telephones were cut off. County Magistrate Zuo Zhiren is resolutely leading his troops to fight. Shierwei and Guazhou are still in the hands of the garrison.

[Our Jiangyin Dispatch, 25th] Huangtiangang was completely blockaded at 3:00 PM on the 25th. Personnel from various agencies in Jingjiang have been evacuated. Chengdi is quiet, but the sound of gunfire can be heard intermittently from north of the river.

### Shao Lizi and Zhang Zhizhong in Frequent Contact in Shanghai

[Report from our newspaper] Judging from various signs, the consultation on the prelude to the peace talks in Shanghai is still in the initial stage of exploring opinions. The realization of figures from the third party going to Nanjing to jointly discuss national affairs still requires continued efforts. Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, and Gan Jiehou, a representative of Acting President Li, held a meeting at Qian Xinzhi's residence on Yuyuan Road. Gan gave a detailed report on the negotiations he had conducted in Shanghai in the past two days. Subsequently, Mo Dehui also rushed to the meeting. They reviewed the Northeast issue and the release of Zhang Xueliang. As for whether Mo will serve as a peace talk representative, a decision will be made after further consideration. After the initial meeting, Shao and Zhang, accompanied by Qian Xinzhi, visited Du Yuesheng to inquire about the views of the city's business community on the peace talks. Around 11:00 AM, the two drove to the Hongqiao Sanitarium to visit Zhang Lan and Luo Longji, persons in charge of the China Democratic League in Shanghai. Before the two arrived, Huang Yanpei had already arrived at the hospital around 9:00 AM and had a secret talk with Zhang and Luo for more than an hour. However, Huang did not participate in the meeting between the government representatives and Zhang and Luo. During the meeting, it was heard that the Democratic League's attitude was very calm. They expressed great concern about the members of the League who were arrested in various places, and also expressed their views on the temporary non-revocation of martial law. The meeting ended at 1:00 PM. In the afternoon, Shao and Zhang originally planned to visit Madam Sun Yat-sen to exchange views on the current situation, but because Madam Sun's blood pressure was too high and she felt slightly unwell, the date of the meeting was not determined. The two will visit again after receiving a phone call from Madam Sun. In addition, the two met with Zhang Junmai to discuss matters.

Shao Lizi told reporters that he might return to Nanjing on the 26th.

[Another report] Gan Jiehou visited Shao Lizi and Zhang Zhizhong around 8:00 AM yesterday to report on the negotiations he had held with people from the three parties in the past two days, and met with Mo Dehui to discuss the Northeast issue and the release of Zhang Xueliang. At 3:00 PM, the head of the TASS Chinese branch, Rogov, visited and had a long talk. It is heard that Gan emphasized the necessity of Sino-Soviet friendship from the historical perspective of the national revolution. He then drove to visit Chen Mingshu and Zhang Shizhao. Gan's mission in Shanghai has been completed, and he returned to Nanjing by train last night.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Acting President Li cabled Mo Dehui in Shanghai on the 25th, inviting him to go to Taipei and asking Zhang Xueliang to come to Nanjing.

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 25th] Regarding the release of Yang Hucheng, Mayor Yang Sen of Chongqing told reporters on the morning of the 25th that he had not yet received the order, and he emphasized that even if the telegram arrived, he would submit it to the Pacification Headquarters for processing. According to people who had visited Yang Hucheng, Yang is currently living in a secluded courtyard in Ciqikou, Chongqing. Although he is accompanied by a son, a female servant, and an adjutant, he is clearly suffering from a nervous breakdown. The relevant parties are still refusing to disclose information about Yang's life.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] After Acting President Li issued an order to release political prisoners across the country, Pu Xixiu, a reporter for the Xinmin News in Nanjing, will be one of the first to be released.

### Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sends Notes to Foreign Embassies: Announces Government's Imminent Move to the South: Legislative and Supervisory Yuan to Accompany the Move to Guangzhou

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated: Regarding the government's move to the south, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued separate notes to the embassies of various countries in China for the first time on the evening of the 25th, based on the government's decision.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The embassies of various countries in Nanjing are still refusing to release any news about the move to the south. As of the 25th, no embassy has requested the government to provide assistance with transportation or housing in Guangzhou. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a written note following the previous verbal notification, announcing that the government will move to the south and hoping that the embassies of various countries will follow. It is expected that when the Executive Yuan officially moves to Guangzhou to conduct business, there will be a second note. At that time, the embassies of various countries will make a definite statement and take action. It has also been learned that several American military aircraft will be concentrated in Nanjing on the 28th and 29th to await orders.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The third session of the Legislative Yuan will be held in Guangzhou next month. This was announced by President of the Yuan, Tong Guanxian, at a symposium with legislators in Nanjing on the afternoon of the 25th. The meeting on the 25th was jointly convened by President Tong and Vice President Liu Jianqun. More than 100 members attended. After the meeting began at 3:00 PM, President Tong first reported that the Central Political Council had made a resolution on the government's move to the south on the 24th, and the various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan were actively conducting evacuations and would make a public announcement soon.

Members who take individual action are expected to depart before the end of the month. The Yuan plans to contact the Ministry of Communications to allocate a special train, which will depart on the 29th. Vice President Liu Jianqun then made a supplementary explanation, stating that although the central government is determined to sincerely seek peace, the CCP's military actions have not ceased. Nanjing is now facing artillery fire, and various agencies cannot normally handle official business in this war zone. In order to ensure that the efforts to seek peace can achieve the desired results on schedule, it is necessary to move to a safe area in the south. Subsequently, several committee members raised opinions on the technical and administrative issues of the move to the south, hoping that the Yuan would pay attention to them. The meeting adjourned at 4:15 PM.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Supervisory Yuan has decided to move to Guangzhou. More than 20 members of the Yuan who remained in Nanjing convened a temporary symposium at 10:00 AM on the 25th to discuss the Yuan's evacuation in a confidential manner. The meeting was presided over by the President of the Yuan. It was decided to leave Nanjing and move to Guangzhou in the shortest possible time. The regular meeting this week will be temporarily suspended due to the small number of members in Nanjing.

Editorial

### Japanese General Election Results Announced

The results of the Japanese House of Representatives general election held on the 23rd of this month have been fully revealed. Of the 466 seats, the Democratic Liberal Party won 263 seats, the Democratic Party 70 seats, the Socialist Party 49 seats, the Communist Party 35 seats, the Cooperative Party 14 seats, the Labour-Farmer Party 7 seats, the Social Reform Party 5 seats, and other smaller parties and independents a combined 24 seats. Undoubtedly, the Democratic Liberal Party has gained an absolute advantage in this general election. According to the Japanese Constitution, the leading party has the right to form a cabinet. Therefore, after the meeting on February 15th, Shigeru Yoshida will certainly continue in his role, which has become a certainty.

The previous session of parliament was formed in April 1946 and dissolved in late December last year. In these nearly three years, the distribution of power among the various parties in the House has illustrated the changes in Japanese politics. At the beginning of the parliamentary organization, the Socialist Party, with 143 seats, once rose to become the leading party. Later, due to internal divisions, it was reduced to about 110 seats and relegated to the second largest party. This time, the Socialist Party suffered a drastic decline, winning only 49 seats, a loss of 62 seats. At that time, the Liberal Party, which had 130 seats and ranked second, later changed its name to the Democratic Liberal Party due to increased strength, increasing its seats in parliament to 150 and becoming the leading party. This time, the Democratic Liberal Party won the general election, increasing by 113 seats, accounting for half of all members. All other parties, except the Communist Party, have experienced changes of a few seats due to joys and sorrows, unions and separations. The Kijuro Shidehara faction, originally of the Democratic Party, defected to the Democratic Liberal Party. Later, because Hitoshi Ashida was once arrested and his reputation tarnished, the majority of Democratic Party members transferred their allegiance to the Democratic Liberal Party. If Ken Inukai had not come forward to inherit the leadership of the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party might have completely disintegrated. The Democratic Party initially held 90 seats in parliament. This time, it relied heavily on the support of Shigeru Yoshida in the election, retaining 70 seats and narrowly gaining the position of the second largest party. The Cooperative Party originally held 29 seats in parliament. This time, it won 14 seats in the general election, almost collapsing. About half of the party's conservative members defected to the Democratic Liberal Party camp.

Overall, the results of this general election show that Japanese politics are undergoing rapid polarization. This change, on the one hand, shows the rise of conservative forces, gaining an absolute overwhelming advantage in Japan. On the other hand, it shows the extreme left-wing forces moving towards communism. The Communist Party's rapid advancement in this general election is clear evidence of this fact. In today's Japanese politics, the Democratic Liberal Party led by Shigeru Yoshida represents the conservative force camp. He is the extreme right wing in Japan, not only anti-communist and anti-democratic, but also advocates believing in the Emperor and restoring the militarist system. The Democratic Liberal Party's victory in this election was due to the encouragement of MacArthur's policies, and the Social Democratic parties lost the faith of voters due to multiple corruption cases. Thus, most of the votes were attracted to the Democratic Liberal Party. This also shows that the Japanese people's psychology of "loyalty to the emperor and love of the country," and the concept of restoring the old order, have not changed in the slightest, and are increasingly superstitious about conservative forces. In another fact, the Communist Party originally held four seats in parliament, had no voice, and its mass base was weak. All labor and farmer activities were generally in the hands of the left wing of the Socialist Party. As a result of this general election, Socialist Party leader Tetsu Katayama not only lost the election, but even leftists such as Kanji Kato and Masaru Betchaku also lost. It is estimated that the votes of workers and farmers have gone to the Communist Party, so the Communist Party was able to jump from four seats to 35 seats, an increase of about nine times. Another left-wing party, the Labor-Farmer Party, which is on the same front as the Communist Party, also won seven seats this time. The two parties together have 42 seats. In the new parliament, they may form a left-wing united front and become the government's only opposition party. The future direction of the Democratic Party may tend towards the Democratic Liberal Party. The Socialist Party will inevitably be disgusted by both the left and right in a difficult situation in the middle, and will only follow the path of increasing decline. In short, the victory of this Japanese general election belongs to the Democratic Liberal Party and the Communist Party. One side is the victory of the extreme right, and the other side is the victory of the extreme left, and the opposition and irreconcilability between the two will only deepen and develop. The current situation in Japanese politics is like this, and the future trend will be the same.

### End of the North China Pacification Headquarters; National Army Still Responsible for the Security of Beiping

[Beiping, this newspaper, 25th] The North China Pacification Headquarters has begun to handle its closure. The Headquarters is currently putting all its efforts into handling the troop transfer work. It is heard that the majority of the National Army has been leaving the city successively, and this can be completed within one or two days. During the transition period, the joint office of both parties will be formally established after the National Army completes its redeployment, and Guo Zongfen will serve as the deputy chairman of the office. According to the disclosure of the Pacification Headquarters, the security of Beiping will still be the responsibility of the National Army in the near future. However, when senior Communist personnel enter the city, a part of the security forces will accompany them and will share the responsibility for security.

[Beiping, this newspaper, 25th] Sun Ke made a long-distance phone call to Fu Zuoyi last night, the 24th, inquiring about the situation in Beiping. According to Fu's aides, the situation of the Beiping peace talks is reported to the central government at any time, so the central government has a good understanding of the armistice in North China.

[Hankou, this newspaper, 25th] Fu Zuoyi recently telegraphed Zhang Zhen, chairman of Hubei Province, explaining the situation of the ceasefire agreement with the Communist army.

### Acting President Li Reiterates Determination to Strive for Peace; Speech at the Kuomintang Central Commemoration Week

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The Kuomintang Central Headquarters held an expanded commemoration week on the morning of the 24th. Chairman Yu Youren and Acting President Li attended and gave speeches. First, he said that the compatriots of the whole country are currently in a state of extreme suffering, and as a soldier serving the government, he has failed to fulfill his due responsibilities and is deeply ashamed. He then recounted the arduous struggle of the Chinese Kuomintang for national independence and people's freedom over the past decades, and analyzed the reasons for today's failure. Acting President Li said in a firm tone, "Our revolutionary goal is to strive for peace. After the victory of the War of Resistance, everyone thought that they could enjoy peace from then on and rebuild the dilapidated homes. Unfortunately, the war broke out again. Wherever the flames of war passed, the people were trapped in hunger and cold, in deep water and scorching fire. This kind of suffering is no less than what was suffered during the eight years of the War of Resistance. Now the people of the whole country unanimously hope to stop the armed struggle and call for peace. The purpose of the revolution is to maintain and promote the interests of the country and the people. The propositions and actions of the revolutionary party should also be based on the will of the people. Therefore, the government has now decided to use the highest sincerity and the greatest effort to promote the realization of peace. This kind of painstaking effort should be understood by all comrades of our party and compatriots of the whole country." Then, Acting President Li repeatedly expounded the reason why force cannot be relied on, and cited examples from ancient and modern China and foreign countries. In history, far away like Qin Shi Huang and Napoleon, and recently like the warlord forces occupying various parts of China before the Northern Expedition, and Germany and Japan before World War II, all failed because they were superstitious about force. Therefore, the ancients have the saying that "those who are good at war are subject to severe punishment." This kind of bloody lesson in history can serve as a warning. Finally, he said: "After President Chiang retired, I had no choice but to reluctantly accept the heavy responsibility due to the urging and encouragement of the Director-General and all comrades. I was born into a poor peasant family and am an extremely ordinary person. I feel deeply apprehensive about this heavy burden. In the future, I can only act in good conscience, do my best, and be open and honest with the compatriots of the whole country to overcome the current difficulties and achieve the realization of true peace. I especially hope that all comrades of our party and all seniors will give me guidance at any time, so that we can overcome the difficulties together." Car derailment injured many passengers.

### British Tram Workers Insist on Borrowing Half a Month's Salary; The Social Bureau Decides Not to Consider It; All Tram Lines Start Running from the Factory in the Afternoon

[This newspaper] The strike of French tram workers has been resolved, and the British tram company has also caused a dispute due to the issue of borrowing salary. Yesterday morning, trams on all British lines, both tram and trolley bus, did not leave the factory. After persuasion from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, they were dispatched at 1:30 pm, but all tram lines implemented the sale of "low-price tickets," regardless of distance, all at three yuan. They returned to the factory in the evening. Shao Changyuan, the driver of the 69th tram line, fainted and died of shortness of breath yesterday morning when he went to the Jing'an Temple Reprocessing Plant to take over his shift due to the labor strike. Workers pointed out that he died of shortness of breath because he heard that the request to borrow half a month's salary was not granted.

Deputy Director Zhao of the Social Affairs Bureau believes that the workers' strike and slowdown actions are caused by a few people stirring up trouble and are without any reason. In addition to doing his best to persuade, he has asked Mayor Wu for instructions on the workers' request to borrow half a month's salary, and it has been decided not to consider it. Wages will absolutely not be paid during the strike or slowdown period. If the workers still do not return to work, Commander Tang has instructed that the case be transferred to the military authorities for handling.

According to Deputy Director Zhao, "The financial situation of all public utilities in this city is currently not good. This year's employee bonus was issued by the municipal government after trying to negotiate a loan of 36 million yuan from the Central Bank. The employee bonus for public utilities is calculated according to the January index, which is already superior to other industries, but the employees have requested to borrow half a month's salary at the end of the lunar year according to the old practice. The company has no money to pay, and the employees of the French tram company went on strike on the 24th. Commander Tang, Mayor Wu, and Commander Chen were all very angry when they heard the news. After consulting with Deputy Minister Lu of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Industry, they convened representatives of the six major companies on the afternoon of the 24th for five and a half hours of discussion. It was decided that half of January's salary would be paid in advance before the lunar New Year. In addition, seven and a half days' salary will be pre-paid, which will still be negotiated by the municipal government, and the Central Bank will loan it to the companies for distribution. At that time, all the union representatives were satisfied with this. Unexpectedly, after hearing the news, some workers of the British tram company pointed out that the union representatives were bribed 28 tombs yuan by the capitalists and deliberately agreed to reduce the request to borrow half a month's salary to seven and a half days. As a result, the public was indignant and a strike occurred. Shao Changyuan, the driver of the 69th tram line, opposed the strike and wanted to drive the tram out of the factory. He was surrounded and stopped, fainted on the spot, and died after being sent to the hospital for treatment. The workers then requested, in addition to borrowing half a month's salary, and asked for preferential treatment for Shao Changyuan. Now, in addition to the request to borrow half a month's salary not being considered, Shao Changyuan died out of sympathy for the union representatives and should be given preferential treatment."

### Before the Communist Side Ceases Fire, Martial Law in This City Will Continue to be Implemented; Instigating Strikes Will Be Severely Punished

I have not yet received the order. The revocation of the martial law order should have a distinction between time and space. Songhu is currently on the front line. Before the Communist Party stops military action, the martial law order must continue to be implemented. Chen then told the reporter: Strikes are absolutely prohibited during martial law.

Suggesting that the National Bank of China has no need to move to Guangzhou

### The Silver, Money, and Trust Industries Telegraphed to Congratulate Acting President Li; Suggesting that the National Bank of China has no need to move to Guangzhou

The Shanghai Silver, Money, and Trust Association telegraphed Acting President Li in Nanjing to congratulate him. The original text is as follows: To Acting President Li in Nanjing: Since the civil war, the country has been in turmoil. Your Excellency resolutely assumed the position of Acting President, wanting to start with compassion and kindness, and with the people. I respectfully read "Your Excellency's Proclamation," which states that all past laws and actions that hinder the people's freedom and are inconsistent with democratic principles will be promptly repealed or suspended. This is indeed the first good sign that our country is turning from adversity to prosperity. The national conflict originated from the Ning faction split in 1927, and went through six cruel wars in Jiangxi. A united front was established due to the common resistance against Japan. After the victory, with the people hoping for the success of the Political Consultative Conference and jointly planning construction, the civil war suddenly broke out again, which has lasted for two and a half years. Suspicion has deepened and become more intense, resentment has accumulated and become more fierce, and the psychological distance between the two sides has become farther and farther. Therefore, seeking peace today is by no means something that can be achieved in one step. I respectfully ask Your Excellency to persevere with perseverance, follow with patience, and do everything with sincerity, then even gold and stone can be opened. Comrades in the financial sector should put safety first. In terms of finance, safety should be the first priority. There were rumors that the Central Bank of China in Shanghai would soon be evacuated, and people were quite panic-stricken. The Central Bank is the bank of banks, and the turnover and operation of all our banks and companies depend on the Central Bank. In the unlikely event of evacuation, the financial sector will lose its leadership, and the impact can be imagined. Fortunately, on the 22nd of this month, President Liu Gongyun replied to reporters that the rumor that the Central Bank was moving to Guangzhou was unfounded. The industry was slightly relieved. Now that the government is actively seeking peace, not only is there no need for the Central Bank to move, but the fact that it does not move can be used as an expression of sincerity in seeking peace. Is there anything wrong with my humble opinion? I beg Your Excellency's judgment. Chairman Li Ge of the Shanghai Banking Association, Chairman Shen Rixin of the Silver and Money Commercial Association, Chairman Qi Zhi of the Trust Commercial Association and all members respectfully offer this.

### Busy Military Transportation on Two Railways, Unprecedented Train Chaos, Rumors of Passenger Service Interruption Untrue

[Taibao News] Due to busy military transport on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways in recent days, tracks are congested, and passenger trains are experiencing extreme difficulties. Furthermore, with the end of the year approaching, the number of travelers returning home has suddenly increased, further disrupting order at stations and on passenger trains. Extra trains often fail to comply with the railway bureau's scheduling and frequently try to run ahead, making it impossible for passenger trains to depart. The most delayed trains have been delayed for over ten hours, and the number of accumulated passengers is increasing. The overcrowding in the train cars has reached an alarming level. There are several incidents daily of passengers climbing on top of trains and falling to their deaths. Veteran workers who have worked at the railway bureau for decades say they have never seen such chaotic conditions. Yesterday, rumors in the city that passenger service on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway had been interrupted or that passenger trains only ran as far as Zhenjiang were unfounded. A reporter inquired with the railway bureau about the situation on the Beijing-Shanghai line at 10:00 PM last night. According to reports, Zhenjiang, Danyang, and Nanjing are all safe and normal, and the railway is unobstructed. Only the military trains are congested, preventing passenger trains from departing on time.

The express train to Xiaguan Station, which was supposed to arrive in Beijing at 12:30 PM, was also delayed by five hours. Other trains were delayed by several hours as well. On the 25th, only the Qiantang train departed from Beijing in the morning. The station was chaotic, and the luggage of passengers piled up like mountains on the platform. When boarding, people rushed and pushed, and the overcrowding was even worse than during the previous evacuation. It was common for passengers to have tickets but be unable to board. Whenever a train stopped at the station, it was immediately filled with people of all kinds. The front and top of the train were packed with people, and even the driver's cab was occupied by passengers, preventing the driver from performing his duties. According to railway bureau officials on the 25th, the normal operation of all trains will be difficult to restore unless the order of boarding is improved.

As of yesterday, the association had received over 4,000 applications from various factories, with 3,000 having been reviewed. Based on their nature, they are divided into two categories: Category A includes machinery, manufacturing, copper and iron smelting, chemical raw materials, casting, and over ten other industries. Category B includes small industries such as household chemicals and handmade dyeing and weaving. Category A has a term of 90 days with a monthly interest rate of 1.5%, while Category B has a term of 60 days with a monthly interest rate of 2.4%. Most applicants are expected to be approved, with amounts ranging from 20,000 to 100,000 yuan. Only a small number of applicants who have not legally registered with the industrial and commercial social departments or whose number of workers is unknown have not been approved. Those who have only joined commercial guilds are also not eligible for industrial loans. If a factory has joined two guilds due to the similarity of its nature and has applied repeatedly, it will be classified according to its nature and one application will be removed. Factories that have been approved for industrial loans will receive a notification letter from the association within days and are expected to receive their loans in full within the Lunar New Year for working capital. The banks designated to provide these loans currently include the Central Bank, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank, Central Trust of China, Postal Savings Bank, Cooperative Bank, and the Municipal Bank, totaling seven.

### Suspects Arrested in Murder Case of Quartermaster at Third Supply Station of the Logistics Headquarters Two Years Ago

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the autumn of 1946, Pan Muhua (23 years old, from Fujian, in charge of catering matters), a lieutenant quartermaster at the Third Supply Station of the Logistics Headquarters at 1062 Kunming Road, discovered that Qiu Hengxin (24 years old, from Fujian), a sergeant quartermaster, was suspected of corruption. He dismissed Qiu, who harbored resentment and colluded with messenger Bai Yukun, plotting to murder him. Bai purchased a pair of scissors. Around 4:00 AM on August 2nd of the same year, the two took advantage of Pan's deep sleep to sneak into Pan's bedroom with the weapon. Bai held Pan's hands while Qiu stabbed him in the throat with the scissors. Pan shouted, "Qiu Hengxin is killing me!" before dying. At that time, Manager He Moshan, a major, heard the alarm and arrived, catching a glimpse of Pan lying on the bed, covered in blood. He was unable to speak. A pair of scissors was left in front of the bed, and the murderer had already fled. He rushed to the gate and asked the two guards, who replied that Bai and others had gone out and their whereabouts were unknown.

### Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificate Trading: The National Bank Does Not Wish to Cancel Restrictions, But Can Be Responsible for Maintaining a Certain Price

Regarding the import and export industries' request to cancel Central Bank Order No. 170, Central Bank authorities stated that the purpose of restricting the trading of transfer certificates is to prevent those not engaged in import and export businesses from intermingling and manipulating transfer certificate prices, hence the restriction. This type of restriction must exist in principle. However, to maintain a certain price for transfer certificates to assist free exports, the Central Bank must naturally take responsibility for regulating and restricting foreign exchange transfer certificates.

### Although Money Market Trends Are Relaxing, Cash Is Still Scarce

Yesterday, the city's money market continued to ease, with abundant funds in the market and sluggish demand, resulting in frequent turnover. The underground interest rate in the market ranged from 40 to 50 yuan per diem, with 35 yuan near noon, and some funds were even offered. However, cash settlement was done at 50 yuan. Industry firms have been continuously supplying short-term funds in recent days, and it is said that recent weekly deposits have been very popular.

According to financial circles, remittances from other cities to Shanghai have amounted to about 1 billion yuan in the past week. Industrial loans issued amounted to 300 million yuan, and treasury disbursements amounted to about 600 million yuan. Therefore, the money market in this city is unusually relaxed.

Although the Central Bank has started issuing a new type of 100-yuan note since yesterday, the shortage of cash in the market has not completely subsided, and banker's drafts are still popular, with a discount of about 4%. Furthermore, it is understood that there are many reasons for the lack of cash, the most obvious of which is the Lunar New Year, when returning travelers must carry considerable amounts of money. In addition, the number of people sending money to support families in other cities and posting insured mail at post offices (each letter can be attached with 500 yuan) has been quite crowded in recent weeks.

### The 23rd Discount and Loan Meeting Passed 25 Loan Cases

[Reported by this newspaper] The National Bank's Discount and Loan Committee held its 23rd member meeting at 4 p.m. on the 24th, chaired by Liu Gongyun. The meeting discussed 27 cases reviewed by the Industrial, Mining, Trade, and Agricultural Advisory Committees last week, and two temporary proposals. Excluding three cases that were declined or postponed, a total of 23 loan cases for transportation, public utilities, and industrial and mining enterprises were approved. In the agricultural field, two loan plans submitted by the China Farmers Bank for Qingdao refugee resettlement and grain storage collateral loans were approved. In addition, in order to assist export businesses in obtaining foreign exchange, the committee approved that export businesses in need of working capital could be assisted by means of foreign exchange swaps. Because this method is suitable for manufacturers in port cities, it cannot fully provide foreign letters of credit to exporters in the interior, and it is difficult to handle. It was further stipulated that exporters in the interior who are unable to handle foreign exchange swaps may be assisted on the condition that the bank guarantees foreign exchange settlement (except in cases of force majeure).

### Quiet Tea Market

Tea merchants have little intention to trade, resulting in a dormant state of trading. Only a few occasional deals are done, mainly to settle accounts, and the trend is calm and uneventful.

Retail investors still mostly closed positions, and the price of muslin fell at the end. Gold prices also fell slightly, and all parties lost interest, and the market generally entered a weak state, with bids gradually falling to 72,500 yuan at closing. The atmosphere in the afternoon was dull, gold prices continued to fall, selling pressure remained strong, and buyers were still cautious. Tianqiao sold at 70,000 yuan.

Raw silk: Due to the small increase in the foreign exchange transfer rate, merchants frequently covered their shorts, and the intention to sell increased. Neither export nor domestic sales moved. As the end of the year approached, large firms remained on the sidelines. Trading turned to scattered transactions. The premium grade opened at 85,000 yuan, and the market slightly improved after the improvement of the gold price, and the merchants holding goods wanted to stabilize the market, and the market slightly improved. Later, it was heard that various goods had fallen again, and the foreign exchange transfer certificate continued to soften. No one was interested in the market, and the bulls closed their positions again, and the price softened again. The front market closed at 83,000 yuan at noon, and the confidence in the back market continued to weaken, and the gold notes continued to fall, and the premium grade was sold at 80,000 yuan.

The silk market has been relatively stable for days, but yesterday the selling trend turned stronger, and the market continued to decline. Initially, the opening of gold notes and muslin was still strong, and confidence was initially fluctuating. The Mei Ya was called at 50,000 yuan. Later, off-market prices fell all the way, and the atmosphere of peace talks enveloped the market. Confidence was low, and the market was unanimously bearish, and retail investors closed their positions one after another, and the market softened again. After softening, buying re-emerged, and the market rose again, reaching 51,500 yuan. Finally, the money market tightened slightly, and the gold notes returned again, and confidence turned weak, and finally closed at 50,000 yuan.

Therefore, although the money supply was loose, the general sentiment was still weak.

The off-market price of Longtou fine cloth was 2,350 yuan. Laba Tong fine cloth fell all the way from 2,030 yuan to close at 1,980 yuan, down 90 yuan.

### Tung Oil Meandering and Soft

Other items such as Deputy Brand Xihong and Qingyou followed the market and fell back.
