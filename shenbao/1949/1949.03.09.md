### Resignation of the Cabinet Under Pressure; Successor Selection in Progress; Acting President Li Has Invited He Yingqin

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Sources close to Acting President Li stated to reporters on the evening of the 8th: Premier Sun Ke's resignation was accepted after Acting President Li's attempts to persuade him to stay were unsuccessful. His successor is being carefully considered by Acting President Li and will not be proposed until the 11th of this month at the earliest, as the next session of the Legislative Yuan will be on the 11th, at which time consent can be sought. However, given the current situation, the decision on the successor will not be unduly delayed to avoid affecting government affairs, especially the progress of peace talks. The source indicated that Acting President Li had discussed the matter of the successor with relevant parties separately, but before formally proposing a candidate, he needs to solicit opinions from all sides so that the new Premier can meet public expectations. The source solemnly declared that the new cabinet will definitely be a "Peace Cabinet," from the Premier to the heads of all ministries and commissions, all will be individuals who can devote themselves to the peace policy, so as to assist Acting President Li in completing the task of seeking peace. In order to implement political reform and streamline institutions, the reduction and merger of various departments of the Executive Yuan will be implemented concurrently with this cabinet reshuffle. The number of ministries and commissions will be reduced by at least one-third, and there will be many changes in the heads of the ministries and commissions. However, those in the old cabinet who have performed well and whose policies are not contrary to the peace policy may remain in their positions to provide expertise. Regarding the question of whether to invite the Minqing (Democratic Socialist Party) and Qingnian (Youth Party) to participate in the new cabinet, the source said that the government will still invite both parties to participate.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] After Premier Sun Ke announced his resignation in the Legislative Yuan on the afternoon of the 8th, Acting President Li immediately wired He Yingqin at his residence in Shanghai, inviting him to return to Nanjing immediately. However, it was heard that Mr. He had already left Shanghai for Hangzhou in the morning, so the phone call was not received. Acting President Li then wired Chairman Zhou, asking him to find Mr. He and hoping to speak to him by phone in the evening. Mr. He's trip to Shanghai and then Hangzhou was to avoid birthday celebrations (the 12th of this month is Mr. He's birthday) and also to avoid suspicion. Authoritative sources revealed this evening that Acting President Li indeed intends to appoint He Yingqin as Premier and is seeking Mr. He's consent. It is said that Acting President Li had this intention a month ago and had expressed it informally to Mr. He at that time, but Mr. He declined modestly. Now that Sun Ke has resigned, Acting President Li has decided to formally seek Mr. He's opinion first. However, Acting President Li still needs Mr. He's assistance in military affairs and military orders. If Mr. He is willing to form a cabinet, he may concurrently serve as Premier and Minister of National Defense, and another capable Deputy Premier will be appointed to assist Mr. He in handling daily government affairs. It is not yet known whether Mr. He will agree to Acting President Li's invitation.

[Our Newspaper] General He Yingqin left Shanghai for Hangzhou with his wife at 8:00 AM yesterday, accompanied by a staff member surnamed Liu.

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 8th] He Yingqin arrived in Hangzhou from Shanghai at 12:30 PM this afternoon. Zhejiang Chairman Zhou personally greeted him. Mr. He and his wife stayed at Commander Tang's mansion on the Inner West Lake. It is said that this trip is to avoid birthday celebrations.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] It is reported that Huang Shaohong may be appointed as Deputy Premier of the new Executive Yuan.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] After Premier Sun's resignation was submitted, Acting President Li, in addition to inviting He Yingqin to form a new cabinet, has already been looking for cabinet members in advance. As peace talk representative Zhang Shizhao was in Nanjing, he was asked whether he would participate in the new cabinet. It is reported that Mr. Zhang has agreed to consider it. According to reliable sources, Mr. Zhang will serve as the Minister of Justice and Administration in the new cabinet.

### Zhang Zhizhong, Wang Chonghui, and Others Are Also Possible Successors

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] After the Sun Ke cabinet's resignation was approved, the question of who will succeed him is obviously of greatest concern to all parties. However, the candidate will not be announced until Acting President Li considers and decides, and formally requests the consent of the Legislative Yuan. On the 8th, the possible candidates for Premier circulating here are the following, among whom He Yingqin has the highest support.

(1) He Yingqin is unanimously recognized as the most suitable candidate. Mr. He is currently in Shanghai. It is said that he once told people before his departure that if Acting President Li intends to invite him to form a cabinet, he will firmly decline. His greatest concern is that he directly commanded military operations against the Communist army in the past. Although it was due to different government policies at the time, the perception does not seem very appropriate. He is particularly afraid that the Chinese Communists will use it as an excuse to attack, which will affect the peace talks. Moreover, he has already promised Acting President Li to assist him in the reform of military affairs, including the reduction of personnel and the coordination of command. If he takes the post of Premier, it will be difficult for him to concentrate on this.

(2) Some people speculated that Zhang Zhizhong would come forward to form a cabinet after Sun Ke's resignation when Mr. Zhang was invited from Lanzhou to Nanjing. However, he himself denied this. It is generally believed that if Mr. Zhang forms a new cabinet at this time, it can fully demonstrate the government's determination to strive for peace. Although Mr. Zhang has been attacked by the Communist broadcast, his tone is much milder than other attacks. Mr. Zhang is still staying in a certain place, which may be related to this matter.

(3) Some political figures believe that Wang Chonghui, the current President of the Judicial Yuan, may be under Acting President Li's consideration, with He Yingqin as the Deputy Premier to assist him. Because the differences between Nanjing and Guangzhou have not been completely eliminated, inviting a senior member from Guangdong to form a new cabinet may play a coordinating role, with Mr. He as the Deputy Premier to preside over daily government affairs on behalf of Mr. Wang. Moreover, Mr. He can also concurrently serve as Minister of National Defense to handle military and political issues. However, Mr. Wang is old and whether he is willing to serve as Premier in these difficult times is questionable.

(4) It is rumored that Yan Xishan is also a consideration. This speculation is mostly caused by the Shanxi legislator Wu Hexuan's strong opposition to Sun, but the possibility of it becoming a reality is very small.

(5) Zhang Qun is still staying in Nanjing. He has always been the main target considered by President Chiang for the position of Premier. Acting President Li also attaches great importance to Zhang Qun. However, Mr. Zhang has firmly declined the premiership in the two cabinet crises after the implementation of the constitution, and he may not be willing to take on the job again this time.

(6) Gu Mengyu came to Nanjing at the invitation of Acting President Li a few days ago, and then hurried back to Shanghai. Now that Sun Ke has resigned, some people believe that if Mr. Gu forms a cabinet, it can refresh the domestic and international image. However, Mr. Gu has had no intention of pursuing an official career in recent years, and he would not even agree to be the Minister of Education, let alone the Premier who bears the entire administrative responsibility.

(7) In addition, some people have rumored that it is Shao Lizi. Mr. Shao is responsible for the peace talks with the Chinese Communists, which has almost become an established fact. His task is no less important than that of the Premier, and Mr. Shao cannot fly to Peiping for peace talks in the capacity of Premier. Therefore, it is almost impossible for Mr. Shao to form a new cabinet.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The Sun cabinet's general resignation letter was passed by the political affairs meeting on the afternoon of the 8th, and was signed by the political commissioners separately. At 8:45 PM, Premier Sun personally went to the Chuanhougang official residence to present it to Acting President Li and asked Acting President Li to decide on the successor for the new cabinet as soon as possible. Mr. Sun stayed at the Chuanhougang official residence for several tens of minutes before leaving. The political affairs meeting on the 8th was held at the Presidential Palace at 4:00 PM. Premier Sun and the cabinet members in Nanjing attended. The meeting also decided that before the new cabinet members are decided, they will continue to be responsible until the new cabinet is established. In the future, political affairs meetings will be held at any time as needed. However, the regular meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 9th will be suspended.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The general resignation of the Sun Ke cabinet has been brewing and fluctuating several times. Mr. Sun formally expressed his resignation to Acting President Li on the afternoon of the 6th. That afternoon, Acting President Li personally went to Premier's official residence No. 1 to visit Mr. Sun. At that time, Mr. Sun was taking a nap. Acting President Li did not disturb him, but left a calling card and left. When Mr. Sun woke up and learned that Acting President Li had personally visited him, he immediately drove to the Chuanhougang official residence to pay his respects and asked Acting President Li for any instructions. After talking with Acting President Li for a while, Mr. Sun expressed his intention to resign to Acting President Li and asked him to look for new cabinet members. Acting President Li immediately told him that he had invited Mr. He Jingzhi to form a cabinet, but Mr. He declined modestly, so he still hoped that Mr. Sun would continue to be responsible. On the morning of the 7th, Mr. Sun convened a talk meeting of the Executive Yuan to discuss the general resignation and the issue of attending the Legislative Yuan to report on the policy direction. Although everyone advocated enduring for the sake of the country, opinions on the general resignation issue were not consistent. At this time, in addition to learning about Acting President Li's intention, Mr. Sun also received a reliable report that the opposition of the legislators to him was irreversible. After consideration, he went to the Chuanhougang official residence with Deputy Premier Wu at about 6:00 PM to visit Acting President Li and request his resignation again. Acting President Li initially stated that He Jingzhi was unwilling to take the position and asked him to continue to be responsible. After a long discussion, Mr. Sun said before leaving that when he attended the Legislative Yuan to report on the policy direction tomorrow, could he also report on his resignation? He obtained the consent of the Acting President. Acting President Li then said: "Yes, yes." After Mr. Sun resigned, his resignation was confirmed.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The Sun Ke cabinet's resignation was approved and formally announced by Sun Ke in the Legislative Yuan this morning. The Sun cabinet, which had been in power for only two and a half months, finally had to submit its resignation due to strong criticism from all sides. Sun Ke was appointed as the Premier by President Chiang on November 25 last year, and was approved by the Legislative Yuan on the same day. The period of his cabinet formation was extremely long. On December 20, Mr. Sun announced that his cabinet had been formed. On the 23rd, Mr. Sun took office and held the first political affairs meeting at the same time. On the evening of January 21 this year, when President Chiang retired, Mr. Sun resigned to Acting President Li. Acting President Li encouraged him to continue to perform his duties. Later, due to the sudden attack of the military situation, the Executive Yuan decided to move its office to Guangzhou. The haste of the move south caused some unfortunate events, which gave those who attacked the Sun cabinet ammunition. Coupled with the rumors of disputes between the Presidential Palace and the Executive Yuan, and the resumption of the Legislative Yuan, dissatisfaction arose. By February 28, Mr. Sun had rushed back to Nanjing from Guangzhou to carry out activities, but it was too late.

### Government Peace Talk Representative Zhong Tianxin Resigns; Zhang Shizhao Left Nanjing Last Night and Returned to Shanghai

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Government peace talk representative Zhong Tianxin, in order to express joint responsibility after the general resignation of the cabinet on the 8th, formally resigned from the position of peace talk representative to Premier Sun. The resignation was approved by Premier Sun. Among the five peace talk representatives appointed by the government on January 22, except for Peng Zhaoxian, who had resigned and been approved earlier, Huang Shaohong and Zhong Tianxin also resigned successively. Currently, there are only two peace talk representatives left: Shao Lizi and Zhang Zhizhong.

[United Press, Nanjing, 8th] According to reliable sources, General Zhang Zhizhong will make a long-term stay at President Chiang's residence in Xikou to serve as an informal liaison between President Chiang and Acting President Li. As Mr. Zhang is a government peace talk representative, it is not yet known whether he will return to Nanjing temporarily to participate in the peace talks, which are expected to be held in mid-March. Sources mistakenly believed that Zhang Zhizhong went to Xikou for only a few days and believed that his "delayed" return indicated that something went wrong. Rumors here that Zhang has been "detained" are purely unfounded.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Bai Chongxi and Gu Zhutong jointly hosted a banquet for Zhang Shizhao and Cheng Qian at 7:00 PM on the 8th. Mr. Zhang came to Nanjing to exchange opinions on the current situation with Cheng Qian. After staying in Nanjing for three days, he returned to Shanghai by night train on the 8th.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Premier Sun Ke attended the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 8th. After announcing that his resignation had been approved, he gave a supplementary report on the administration since taking office, which lasted for one hour. Because Sun had resigned, the interpellation after his report was "waived" by the legislators. When Mr. Sun reported, the heads of the Executive Yuan, Wu Tiecheng, Xu Yongchang, Hong Lanyou, Wu Shangying, Zhong Tianxin, Liu Weichi, Sun Yueqi, Xu Kan, Pang Songzhou, Chen Xueping, and Guan Jiyu, were all present. Mr. Sun's report was the same as his previous conversation with reporters, but he revealed three things: (1) Regarding the issue of troop reduction, Acting President Li has invited General He Yingqin to organize a military reform committee to be responsible for research, so that the total number of military personnel can be reduced from 4.2 million to 3 million. (2) After the implementation of the financial and monetary reform plan, the government's total annual income is expected to reach 90 million US dollars, while the government's total annual expenditure is 600 million US dollars. Therefore, the total income is not enough for two months' expenditure, and retrenchment must be implemented. (3) The government is determined to reform politics and merge redundant institutions. The Executive Yuan itself has 18 units and plans to reduce one-third of them. The same is true for provincial and municipal governments. The provincial government agencies are too large and should restore the system of four departments and one office to save government expenses. When Mr. Sun reported, he first mentioned the peace issue. He emphasized that he was ordered to form a cabinet last year without his consent. At the beginning of the cabinet formation, he took the implementation of the peace policy as his own responsibility. He advocated not proposing the five principles proposed in President Chiang's New Year's message, but was not adopted by President Chiang. After Acting President Li took office, the Executive Yuan successively passed the resolutions to suspend duties first, then negotiate, and appoint peace talk representatives. When the Shanghai People's Peace Delegation invited by Acting President Li returned to Peiping, the peace talks were quite optimistic. The Chinese Communists indicated that they were willing to negotiate after March 15, and the government has sent ten people to study and draft the government's peace talk plan. In recent days, because several of the ten people have left Nanjing, the meeting has not been held. Regarding the government's move to Guangzhou, Mr. Sun also explained that the government's move was decided during Premier Weng's tenure and began to prepare. The government's move south on March 20 was decided under the guidance of Acting President Li after three consultations. At that time, due to the changes in the military situation, the original seven armies guarding Jiangbei were reduced to three, and the military person in charge also urged the government to complete the move within three days. Therefore, on January 26, the foreign envoys were notified to move to Guangzhou, but the move south was too hasty, and some heads of agencies went before the agencies, causing unfortunate events, for which I express my regret. Regarding the reform of politics, Mr. Sun pointed out several key points: (1) Reduce the burden on the people. Military expenditure is too high. The troops have now been reduced to 4.2 million, and it is hoped that they will be reduced to 3 million in the future. There are many abuses in the conscription system, and it is planned to change it to a voluntary military service system. The military believes that a sudden change of system can easily lead to abuse and should be carefully considered, but the conscription method must be improved, and a voluntary military service system should be implemented at the same time. (2) Regarding the collection of grain, although it is planned to abolish it, it is still difficult to achieve for a while. The recent financial and monetary reform plan stipulates that borrowing will be stopped from this year. Whether the collection of grain can be abolished is being considered by the financial authorities. (3) Regarding the issue of currency value, the currency reform last year failed due to insufficient consideration. The fundamental solution at present is peace, disarmament, and reduction of military expenditure. The palliative solution is to allow the free circulation and trading of gold and silver in the financial and monetary reform plan, but foreign currencies are still not allowed to circulate. Efforts should be made to increase exports and restrict imports. Customs duties should be collected in customs gold units, and some of the commodity taxes should be implemented to increase government revenue and protect tax value. However, the annual income is 90 million US dollars, and the annual expenditure is 600 million US dollars. The income is not enough for two months' expenditure, so the government must make every effort to tighten its belt. (4) Regarding the protection of people's freedom, the Special Criminal Tribunal has been abolished, and consequently, several related regulations such as the Special Criminal Tribunal Organization Regulations, the Special Criminal Tribunal Review Regulations, and the Emergency Punishment Law for Endangering the Country have been abolished by the Executive Yuan, and political prisoners in various places have also been decided to be released. (5) Regarding improving administrative efficiency, the salaries of civil servants have been decided to be adjusted according to the local cost of living index in the current month starting from March, and salaries will be paid twice a month to maintain livelihood. Central and local agencies will be simplified, and redundant agencies should be reduced. In addition, issues such as adjusting the functions and powers and financial resources of the central and local governments, as well as local autonomy, should be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the constitution. Mr. Sun finally said that he has only been the Premier for two and a half months, and has not made much progress in administration. He has now submitted his resignation, which has been approved by Acting President Li. He hopes that the nomination of the new Premier will be unanimously supported by the Legislative Yuan, so that the new Executive Yuan can be established quickly.

### Premier Sun Announces Approval of His Resignation; Overcomes the Difficult Interpellation in the Legislative Yuan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] After Sun Ke announced the approval of his resignation, the fierce atmosphere of anti-Sun in the Legislative Yuan was eliminated. The 8th morning was the date for the third meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan. The members attached importance to Mr. Sun's policy report, but most of the members did not know that Sun had resigned, so they still discussed the anti-Sun matter one after another. At the entrance of the venue, mimeographed drafts of letters to Sun Ke and Acting President Li were distributed, asking those who agreed to sign to promote Sun Ke's resignation. Then, the news of the approval of Mr. Sun's resignation was spread by some members, and the members continued to discuss countermeasures separately. After the meeting, Sun Ke led the heads of the Executive Yuan into the venue and sat on the right side of the podium. When President Tong announced that he would invite Premier Sun to make a policy report, the audience applauded sporadically. Mr. Sun announced the approval of his resignation before reporting on the policy. It is said: "Yesterday, the Deputy Premier Wu and I asked Acting President Li for instructions, and we have obtained the permission of Acting President Li, so I am submitting a report to your hospital. Our hospital has resigned to Acting President Li and has been agreed to. Acting President Li is now slightly seeking successors." All the members present burst into applause, Mr. Sun remained calm and calmly made his policy report, which should have been submitted when he took office, but now it has become a policy report submitted at the time of resignation, which lasted for one hour before the chairman announced a recess. At this time, some members decided that if Sun only verbally resigned, the interpellation should continue. If Mr. Sun submitted a written resignation, the interpellation procedure could be exempted. After the continuation meeting, Li Feng spoke first. He said that Premier Sun's resignation this time was out of consideration for the country's difficulties and the people's hope, so it was still a "glorious resignation." However, a question has arisen at this time, that is, whether to raise questions on his policy report. He suggested that if Premier Sun submitted a written resignation before 12:00 noon on the 9th, there would be no need to conduct the interpellation. If the written resignation was not submitted by then, the interpellation should continue on the afternoon of the 9th. Huang Yuren, Jiang Yi, and others advocated that since Premier Sun had announced his resignation in public, it should be followed up. Therefore, the interpellation should be stopped to save time. Although some people in the venue still advocated that whether Premier Sun resigned or not, the interpellation should be conducted as usual, when the chairman asked the audience whether the interpellation could be stopped, no one expressed any objection. Sun Ke's major difficulty in dealing with the interpellation was easily overcome by the move of resignation. Mr. Sun then led the heads of the Executive Yuan to leave the meeting. Before leaving, Mr. Sun took off his hat and nodded to the audience as a courtesy, and then calmly left the venue. The meeting then continued to discuss the bills. A storm that was about to come was ended in this way, which was unexpected by the audience. As for the letter to Acting President Li, which was distributed before the meeting, the Secretary-General Chen Kewen, on behalf of the members, announced that it would be withdrawn because things had passed, and asked reporters not to publish it.

### Stop Conscription and Grain Collection; To Be Handled at the Next Meeting

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The Legislative Yuan held the third meeting of the third session on the morning of the 8th, and passed the proposal submitted by Li Feng and 103 others, requesting the Premier of the Executive Yuan, the heads of important ministries and commissions, and political commissioners to return to Nanjing to work. During the peace talks, the political affairs meeting should be quickly resumed in Nanjing to benefit the administration and promote peace. The case was discussed together with the Executive Yuan's official letter that the government decided to move to Guangzhou, the heads of various agencies should bring the necessary personnel as scheduled, and the remaining personnel should be evacuated separately before February 5, and the case of the relocation location of various agencies. There was almost no one who held a positive objection during the discussion, and it was quickly passed. Today's meeting was chaired by Tong Guanxian. The meeting was opened at 9:35 AM. After the secretariat read two reports, Premier Sun announced that his resignation had been approved, but he continued to give a policy report. Because the audience decided to stop the interpellation, there was time to pass Li Feng's proposal before noon. Another item for discussion was Huang Tong's proposal to quickly stop conscription and grain collection. Some advocated reservation, some advocated submission for review. During the vote, it was found that there were only 92 people present, which was less than the legal number. It was decided to leave it for the next meeting to handle, and the meeting was adjourned at 12:05 PM.

### Two Drafting Committees of the Legislative Yuan Will Hold Their First Meetings Today

### Tang Enbo Inspects River Defenses: Fushan and Hupu Ports Not to Be Opened; No Signs of Communist Troops Near Guazhou Moving Towards Ports

[Our Correspondent, Changshu, 8th] Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Capital-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison, in order to strengthen river defenses, arrived in Yu by car at 11 a.m. on the 8th to inspect. At the command post, he met with military and government leaders, listened to reports, and inquired in detail about river defenses. At 1 p.m., he inspected the garrison troops at Shimei Stadium and held a meeting at Dayi Bridge to give instructions. He left Yu at 3:30 p.m. According to what our reporter was told: the river defenses are extremely solid, and he was quite satisfied with this trip, with absolute peace and order assured. It is also learned that the river defense troops have been placed on high alert to ensure safety. A curfew has been imposed in the urban area starting at 11 p.m., and no one is allowed to pass without a night pass.

[Our Correspondent, Suzhou, 8th] Tang Enbo arrived in Suzhou by special train from Shanghai at 10 a.m. on the 8th. After a short rest, he immediately went to Changshu by car to inspect the river defenses. In the afternoon, Tang's adjutant returned to Suzhou and notified that the special train had left Suzhou for Wuxi. It is said that Commander-in-Chief Tang went directly to Wuxi from Yu that day.

[Our Correspondent, Wuxi, 8th] Tang Enbo arrived in Wuxi at 5 p.m. on the 8th. After getting off the train, he went to Sheqiao to inspect the Zhongqin School. On the 9th, he will go to Changshu to provide guidance at the First Pacification Zone's pacification meeting.

[Our Correspondent, Changshu, 8th] Various parties have been appealing for the opening of Fushan and Hupu ports during the fishing season. It is learned that the authorities have not granted permission.

[Our Correspondent, Zhenjiang, 8th] The area along the river in northern Jiangsu is still in a state of calm. Military sources say that the recent movements of the Communist troops can only be seen as a gesture. At most, it is only to complete the necessary preparations and deployments before crossing the river. At present, the defenses of the bridgeheads on the north bank of the Yangtze River under the control of the National Army are extremely solid. Therefore, the talk of "crossing the river" is premature, and there is still some time before the Communist troops' deployment is mature enough for them to attack the bridgeheads.

[Our Correspondent, Zhenjiang, 8th] Military sources here on the 8th denied the following three things: (1) The Communist 11th and 12th Columns, with 30,000 men, are moving towards the Liangtai area, with talk of attacking the port of Qikang. (2) The loss of Sanjiangying at the port. (3) The vanguard of the Communist troops has reached the vicinity of Guazhou. According to official military intelligence, the Communist 11th and 12th Columns are still on both sides of the Hai (An) - Tai (Xian) line and near Ruhuang, with no signs of moving towards the port. Sanjiangying at the port is still under national control, and there has been no major contact in these two places recently. As for the situation facing Zhenjiang, the National and Communist armies have always been confronting each other on the Sanyou River-Shijiaqiao line, with no other changes. Guazhou is about 15 li south of Sanyou River.

[Our Correspondent, Zhenjiang, 8th] The First Pacification Zone's pacification meeting is scheduled to be held in Changshu on the morning of the 9th. Chairman Ding and others went to Changshu on the evening of the 8th.

[Our Correspondent, Zhenjiang, 8th] According to a telegram from Yizheng, at around 2 p.m. on the 8th, a small group of Communist troops launched a sneak attack on the north of Yizheng city. After the county security regiment stationed there counterattacked, they pursued the victory to Majiaji, destroyed the Communist Yizheng County Government in that area, and seized more than 40 shih of public grain. In this battle, the Communist troops suffered more than 50 casualties.

[United Press, Nanjing, 8th] According to unconfirmed reports: Li Mingyang, a supervisor who crossed the river to the north to consult with the leaders of the Communist troops in northern Jiangsu, has returned to Nanjing, bringing back Chen Yi's guarantee that the Communist troops will not launch a military operation to cross the river in the next two months. It is said that Mr. Li submitted a report to Acting President Li on the 7th. At the same time, Mr. Li also brought back a preliminary agreement to restore postal, telecommunications, and commercial relations between the north and south banks of the Yangtze River, with Nantong as the trade center, pending approval by Acting President Li.

Sun Ke Giving a Policy Report in the Legislative Yuan (Central News Agency Photo)

### Editorial: Political Maneuvering Comes to an End: What Will Happen After the Resignation of Sun's Cabinet?

Premier Sun Ke attended the Legislative Yuan yesterday morning to report on his government's policies, first formally announcing that the resignation of his cabinet had been approved by Acting President Li. Before the new cabinet is formed, the current cabinet will continue to work as usual, pending handover. As for the selection of the new cabinet, it is under study by Acting President Li and key figures in Nanjing. According to various reports, one person may be selected from among Zhang Zhizhong, He Yingqin, Shao Lizi, Gu Mengyu, and Wu Tiecheng. At this time when the situation of war and peace is uncertain and becoming increasingly serious, the sudden change of premier will, regardless of whether it causes a political backlash, at least affect the promotion of some administrative measures. We do not wish to dwell on the past, but if the Kuomintang still acts like a party and the government still acts like a government, then after the resignation of Sun's cabinet, it must quickly spur itself on and make amends for its past mistakes. Therefore, from the standpoint of a clear-headed observer, we offer a few perhaps harsh words to the dignitaries regarding the future political situation.

First, when Premier Sun was ordered to form a cabinet, the whole country hoped that he would organize a brand new cabinet, use new people to implement new policies, and give the world a fresh start. However, in the past two and a half months, he has been indecisive and at a loss, shouting about "glorious peace" only to be met with disappointment. Although the relocation of the Executive Yuan to Guangzhou was approved by Acting President Li, it was rushed and subjected to cold ridicule. In addition, the behavior of some cabinet members was heavily criticized, making political reform fundamentally impossible. As a result, politicians colluded, rumors spread, and there seemed to be a dispute between the Executive Yuan and the Presidential Office, forcing Sun's cabinet to resign. From the process of Sun's cabinet's resignation, it can be seen that even when disaster is imminent, the government has not been able to unite sincerely. Now that the Legislative Yuan's goal of a vote of no confidence has been achieved, Acting President Li can act decisively and propose candidates he believes can assist him. The Legislative Yuan should also make every effort to promote the early birth of the new cabinet, so that the Executive Yuan can truly become a responsible cabinet. It must be understood that in this critical period, there must not be a day without a cabinet, and especially not a day without a responsible cabinet. If the Premier and his cabinet continue to be without a central figure and simply follow orders, and everything requires the judgment of the head of state, then who is responsible if policies are wrong or measures fail, the cabinet or the acting president? In the past, before President Chiang's resignation, some people thought that the president was in charge of too many things. Will Acting President Li be able to change this style? If the relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Presidential Office does not focus on establishing a system of responsible cabinet, will there be disagreements again due to policy or power disputes in the future?

Second, the new cabinet's policy guidelines should be realistic and pragmatic, and should not be overly ambitious, only to disappoint the people later. Under the current circumstances, the people's expectations for the new cabinet are not extravagant. In a nutshell, the six words "unity, innovation, peace" can encompass everything. Unity is strength. Without unity, we cannot only fight again, but also achieve equal and comprehensive peace. Innovation is the unanimous demand of the country. The people have been groaning under corrupt politics for a long time. Without political innovation, the people's suffering cannot be alleviated. The corrupt officials who harm the country and the people must be eliminated once and for all, and must not be allowed to remain among them. The miscellaneous taxes that harass the people should also be stopped immediately. As for peace, on the one hand, the government must show sincerity in seeking peace, but on the other hand, it must first stand its ground and have the strength to seek peace. Otherwise, if it is partisan and deceitful, and collapses first, how can it stand on an equal footing with the CCP for peace talks? Wouldn't it be more straightforward to surrender! The road to peace is long and arduous, but despite its twists and turns, ruggedness, and lurking difficulties, as long as the government can reform and revitalize itself, win over the people, it will definitely have the strength to achieve peace.

Third, after the Legislative Yuan reconvened in Nanjing, some legislators, perhaps to express their own "progress," made many bizarre remarks, especially the proposals to stop accepting new US aid and persuade President Chiang to go abroad, which were the most absurd! Regarding the new US aid, Mr. Lapham has repeatedly stated that this is not military aid, but purely economic assistance to relieve the suffering of the Chinese people. Moreover, it is not yet known whether this proposal for US$240 million in aid to China will be approved by the US Congress, but some legislators who represent the Chinese people have already expressed their opposition. How can this be explained? At present, with the household rice program continuing to be implemented, the retail price of rice is already approaching 30,000. If the rationed rice is stopped, the soaring rice price will be inevitable. Yet those who claim to represent the people cannot think about the lives of ordinary people, but only talk about their sincerity for peace, as if accepting the US aid from ECA is "pro-war." Nothing could be stranger than this. Whether the Chinese people need US aid or not, legislators can return to their constituencies to conduct a public opinion poll, and it will not be difficult to understand the trend of public opinion. As for persuading President Chiang to go abroad, we know that behind the sensationalist and divisive reports of some foreign reporters, there is a group of politicians plotting to do so, thinking that they will only be happy if they do so. In all fairness, President Chiang's appointment of people and implementation of policies may have many shortcomings, but for twenty years, he has led the revolution, overthrown the warlords, completed unification, and then led the War of Resistance, defeated the brutal Japan, and achieved the final victory. His contributions to the country cannot be denied even by his political enemies. Moreover, in order to reduce the suffering of the people, he changed his plans and advocated for peace, first retired to show his sincerity, and retreated to his hometown to enjoy the mountains and rivers. Such a broad-mindedness of a statesman who forgets gains and losses is admirable. Moreover, he has been subjected to ridicule for years, but has never defended himself, enduring humiliation and remaining silent, which is beyond the reach of ordinary people. Yet some legislators and their directors seem to want to force him to go abroad before they can release the burden in their hearts. This is truly bitter! If President Chiang has failed the country, is he not allowed to retire to his hometown and be a citizen? Some people think that President Chiang is still issuing orders and interfering in military and political affairs in Xikou, hindering peace talks. Such arguments are even more ridiculous. If President Chiang had no sincerity for peace, why would he retire? If he still cannot dispel people's doubts after retiring, then he can only go to the Soviet Union to let the CCP feel at ease. Otherwise, no matter where President Chiang is, the CCP can propaganda that he is trying to make a comeback. The legislators are really speaking for the CCP too much and not speaking fairly for the people. Why? We the people are fair and have a sense of justice. The "progressive" elements who are currying favor are going too far!

### Changsha Negotiated Prices Not Allowed: Merchants' Conspiracy Foiled

[Our Correspondent, Changsha, 8th] The prices of goods in Changsha are comparable to those in Guangzhou due to the silver dollar pricing. However, the merchants are still not satisfied and conspire to demand that the government recognize that the silver dollar exchange rate can be increased or decreased at any time, and at the same time attempt to overturn the provincial bank's silver dollar exchange rate, making the black market for silver dollars legal.

### After Taiwan Province Restricted Entry: Few Travelers Arrive in Taiwan; Eight People Detained for Having No Documents and Will Be Sent Back to Shanghai

[Our Correspondent, Taipei, 8th] Since the implementation of the Taiwan Province's restriction on entry measures, the Taiwan-Shanghai liners have only carried 13 passengers in the past week. Among them, eight people are detained in Keelung because they have no entry permits and are being prepared to be sent back to Shanghai. Only two passengers arrived on the Minzhong liner that arrived yesterday. It is said that air passengers are slightly favored, and those without documents can complete the procedures, but the number of passengers is also small.

[Our Correspondent] After Taiwan Province implemented the measures restricting the entry of passengers, yesterday, when the Zhongxing liner sailed from Shanghai to Keelung, the number of passengers was only 10% of the number of passenger tickets stipulated, with 35 in first class, 32 in second class, and 107 in fourth class, for a total of only 174 people. According to those familiar with the shipping industry, the income from passenger and cargo transportation on this trip of the Zhongxing liner is not even enough to purchase fuel. Under this situation, its business will inevitably decline like the Beiyang line. Therefore, the shipping industry is seeking to provide convenience to passengers and hopes that Taiwan Province will send personnel to Shanghai to review passengers entering Taiwan, in order to eliminate the trouble for passengers in Shanghai to apply to Taiwan in writing.

[Our Dispatch] Washington, 8th broadcast: Diplomatic sources said that the representatives of the eight countries drafting the North Atlantic Treaty have reached an agreement on the draft treaty, which stipulates that force can be used to resist aggression. However, the current agreement cannot be considered final. The draft has now been sent to the governments of Canada, Britain, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Norway for review. If they agree, the draft will be announced simultaneously by the eight governments in the middle of next week. According to diplomatic sources familiar with the content of the draft, the draft stipulates: (1) If any signatory country is attacked in Europe or North America, it should be considered an attack on all signatory countries. The attacked countries should immediately take various necessary actions, individually and collectively, to maintain security, including the use of force. As for whether to declare war, it will be handled at the discretion of each government. (2) The area to which this treaty applies generally refers to the Atlantic region north of the equator. (3) The validity of this treaty is ten years, and it may be extended for another ten years if the world situation requires it.

[Our Dispatch] Washington, 8th broadcast: US official sources said that the government hopes that the Senate will quickly pass the North Atlantic Treaty by mid-April, and then submit the Foreign Aid Bill to Congress within that month. The government hopes that Congress will not obstruct it, so that the first batch of arms can be shipped to Europe before the end of June.

### US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Approves Second Year of Aid to Europe Fund, Totaling $5.58 Billion

[United Press International, Washington, 8th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today passed the second year of Marshall Plan aid to Europe, totaling $5.58 billion. This case has passed the first major hurdle. The above-mentioned funds include $4.28 billion for the 1950 fiscal year and $1.15 billion for the period from April 3 to June 30, 1949. There is also $150 million for pre-signing contracts for goods to be shipped to Europe in the 1951 fiscal year.

According to Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally, it should be passed by the Senate, but the thirteen members who voted on this case reserved the right to review the total amount of funds again when the Appropriations Committee considers the appropriations. Vandenberg, an important figure in the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the members decided to oppose cutting funds now due to unstable prices. The Foreign Relations Committee has added two amendments to expand the powers of Hoffman, Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration, and another to allow Italians who are willing to move to Central and South America to use American ships, while still stipulating that 50% of the tonnage of American goods shipped overseas must be loaded by American ships as much as possible, and give sympathetic consideration to the American economy when purchasing goods. If all things are equal, the Economic Cooperation Administration should first consider purchasing American surplus goods. Hoffman's expanded powers are two: (1) to allow him to represent the Federal Supply Bureau and sign 20-year contracts with foreign countries to purchase strategic raw materials; (2) to stipulate a uniform water foot for goods shipped to Europe, which is paid by the Economic Cooperation Administration. According to Connally, the Senate will vote on this case as soon as possible, but after the Senate passes it, it must be passed by the House Foreign Relations Committee and the House of Representatives before it can be signed by the President, and then a funding plan can be proposed.

### Western Europe Satisfied with Swift Action

The British welcomed the US move and called it a rapid posture to deal with any tricks that the International Communist Party will launch against the Marshall Plan in 1949. The French pointed out that the $5.58 billion in aid to Europe in the next fifteen months will enable European countries to continue to obtain the necessary recovery materials, and in conjunction with the North Atlantic Treaty, Western Europe can be confident in both economic and military aspects. At the same time, the US Senate's action can also resolve the differences among European recipient countries on the distribution of aid materials for 1949.

### Ten Western European Countries to Hold Meeting at the End of the Month, Organize Political Alliance and Formulate Constitution

[Agence France-Presse, London, 7th] The five countries that signed the Brussels Treaty are scheduled to hold a meeting in London on the 28th of this month to discuss the rules of the European Union. Today, formal invitations have been sent to the governments of Denmark, Italy, Norway, Switzerland, and Ireland, inviting them to send representatives to participate.

[Reuters, Paris, 7th] A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said that Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Italy, and Ireland have agreed in a semi-official capacity to join the five countries of the Western European Union and participate in the proposed European Union Convention.

[United Press International, Paris, 8th] Ten European countries will hold a meeting within a month to organize a Western European political alliance and formulate a constitution. Such an unprecedented move has no precedent in modern history. The draft constitution stipulates that each member state shall send one representative to participate in the council, which has the right to discuss and propose various recommendations, except for defense issues. The location of the Council of Europe and the Parliament will be in Strasbourg, France. The Soviet Union has firmly opposed this organization. After the formation of the Western Political Alliance, it may make the Western democratic countries more united in the Cold War, and its ultimate goal is to organize a close European Federation, just like the United States of North America, and eliminate trade and other barriers.

### Seven Western European Countries Meeting Approves Economic Recovery Action Plan, Utilizing US Aid to Achieve Financial Stability

[Reuters, Paris, 7th] The "Economic Cabinet" of the seven Western European countries met here today to approve the agreed economic recovery action plan. Since last Friday, representatives from Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, Sweden, and Switzerland have been holding daily meetings under the chairmanship of Belgian Prime Minister Spaak, and today's meeting will be the last meeting.

Most of this recovery plan is based on the recommendations of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps, and its main points are: (1) To complete the financial stability of the countries of the Marshall Plan in 1949. (2) To launch a plan to conserve US dollars and earn US dollars, including increasing exports to the US and exchanging materials with Western Europe. (3) Each country should increase the import of raw materials from non-dollar areas to balance US dollar payments, and the United Kingdom insists on this point. (4) Trade plans should take precedence over financial designs. (5) Cooperation in investment policies among countries. (6) The countries receiving Marshall Plan aid should strengthen the coordination of export plans. (7) Develop the business of attracting tourists, increase agricultural production, and freely exchange experts and technical equipment.

### Trusteeship Council Takes Over US-Administered Island Affairs

### Universal Investigation of World Slave Labor, ECOSOC Passes US Proposal

[United Press International, Lake Success, 7th] The United Nations Economic and Social Council today passed the US proposal for a universal investigation of slave labor in the world by a vote of fourteen to three. The Soviet Union, Byelorussia, and Poland voted against it, and India abstained. The US proposal implicitly refers to the inhumane treatment of millions of people in Soviet labor camps and should be investigated by the International Labor Bureau. The resolution calls on Secretary-General Lai to contact the governments of the accused countries in order to obtain their cooperation in conducting the investigation. The Soviet Union has made it clear in past debates that it will refuse the United Nations to investigate behind the Iron Curtain. The Soviet delegation said that this investigation is a plan for the United States to send special agents into the Soviet Union. There is no slavery in the Soviet Union, and slave labor only exists in capitalist countries. American workers are enslaved by the Taft-Hartley Labor Act. The Soviet Union itself proposed a case advocating the establishment of a large-scale labor committee, with one representative elected by every 100 million union members worldwide. If this committee requires an on-site investigation of the labor situation in the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will allow it. The Soviet proposal was rejected by a vote of fifteen to three, with the Soviet Union, Byelorussia, and Poland voting in favor.

### Dulles on US-Soviet Relations: War Not Inevitable

[United Press, Cleveland, 8th] Republican foreign policy spokesman and US representative to the United Nations, Dulles, stated in a speech here on the 8th that "under the current circumstances," the Soviet Union does not plan to start a war with the West. Dulles further warned that if the United States sends a large amount of military aid to Scandinavia, it may trigger a war. If a large amount of military aid is supplied under the proposed Atlantic Treaty, the Soviet Union may "assume" that if it believes its territory is under "imminent and serious threat," it will wage war.

### Rumor: Soviet Troops Enter Bulgarian Territory; Planning to Prevent Turkey and Yugoslavia from Participating in the Mediterranean Pact; Soviets Prepare Air Transport to Break Yugoslavia's Blockade of Albania

[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 8th] Local newspapers reported today that fifteen new Soviet troop units have arrived in Bulgaria. It is said that this information was revealed by political exiles who recently fled Bulgaria to Turkey. It is also said that the Soviet Union is currently putting pressure on Yugoslavia and Turkey not to sign the Mediterranean Pact.

[United Press, Frankfurt, Germany, 7th] It is reported that the Soviet Union is preparing air transport to break Yugoslavia's blockade of Albania. A fleet of four-engine bombers will fly 450 miles from Skopje, over Yugoslav territory to Tirana, twice a week, carrying both passengers and cargo. Although this decision was made by the Skopje government, the aircraft and crew are dependent on the Soviet Union. The outstanding achievements of the US and British airlift in Berlin have seemed to move the Soviet Air Force to show its Cominform members that the Soviet Union can also overcome the blockade problem. Note that the Soviet Union does not have an air corridor in Yugoslavia, which is different in nature from that of the US and Britain in Berlin. It is difficult to predict the outcome if Soviet aircraft try to fly across forcibly, as Yugoslavia has been very attentive to its airspace boundaries in the past.

### US House Passes Bill to Strengthen Foreign Espionage Network

[Reuters, Washington, 7th] The US House of Representatives today passed a bill authorizing the strengthening of the US espionage network abroad. The content of the bill was kept strictly secret when it was first introduced to the House a month ago, and now it has been sent to the Senate for discussion.

The purpose of the bill is to give the Central Intelligence Agency, the center of US intelligence work in the world, permanent authority to carry out its mission. The Bureau is now subject to presidential orders and will no longer be required to publish its payroll and expenditure figures.

The meeting adjourned at around 7 p.m. The following six resolutions were made: (1) Request the Municipal Government to cancel the pricing standard based on Customs Gold Units immediately.

### College and University Students Apply for Public Funding

Various Schools Are Starting to Investigate and Handle

[This Newspaper] The base of the food subsidy for publicly funded students in national colleges and universities in this city has been increased to ten yuan, and March will be issued at 500 times. As a result, the problem that follows is that most of the self-funded students in various schools are unable to pay for food and have requested full public funding. During the previous petition to Beijing by the presidents of various national colleges and universities, this issue was raised, and Acting Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education allowed each school to handle work-study students within the scope of 20% of the number of self-funded students, depending on the situation. The schools are now preparing for this matter, accepting applications and starting investigations.

Fudan President Zhang Yi told reporters that there are more than 7,000 self-funded students in the school, and more than 400 of them have applied for public funding. The school has formulated a method that, regardless of academic performance, applications can be made if the father is dead, the parents are unemployed, the parents are public servants, or the family is in the border area, or the remittance value has depreciated due to the low prices in the hometown.

Tongji University has more than 1,200 self-funded students. President Hou Jianbai said that most of them are from Sichuan, Guizhou and other places. Due to the large number of people requesting public funding, the school has specially changed the quota of 20% of work-study students (that is, full public funding) to 40% of half-funded students, so that more students can benefit. Applications have now begun, and decisions can be made after investigating academic performance and family circumstances.

There are more than 1,000 self-funded students at Jiaotong University, and most of them also request public funding. President Wang Zhizhuo said that the school can only handle it within the scope of 20% of the quota. If the application exceeds the limit, it will be transferred to the Ministry of Education for resolution.

Regarding the matter of national college and university staff requesting further study fees, the presidents of the schools all expressed sympathy and will hold a meeting to exchange opinions within the week. However, the presidents of the schools believe that they can only request this matter on their behalf, and the final decision lies with the Ministry of Education.

### Spring Business Tax to Be Levied Immediately: Calculated Based on the Average Spring Three-Month Price Index; Deadline for Payment Is Ten Days After Receipt of Payment Notice

In order to discuss how to levy this year's spring business tax in this city, the Municipal Finance Bureau specially invited relevant agencies such as the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Industrial Association, the Municipal Government, and the Social Bureau to the Shanghai Municipal Bank on Jiujiang Road yesterday (7th) to hold the fourth meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Business Tax Simplification Assessment Committee. After careful discussion, three methods were decided. After the meeting, the Finance Bureau has immediately calculated the tax according to the resolution and stipulated that each business must pay the tax within ten days after receiving the payment notice. The three methods are recorded below.

(A) The average of the total price index for the three months of spring in the 38th year will be used to calculate the amount of spring tax payable. Because the total price index for March has not yet been compiled and published, the total price index for February will be used as the index for March for averaging and calculation, which is equivalent to calculating and levying the amount of tax levied in the winter of the 37th year at 45 times the base. The minimum amount of business tax levied this spring shall not be less than 500 gold yuan.

(B) Businesses should still pay the spring business tax within ten days after receiving the payment notice. If it is overdue, it will be considered overdue. If it is overdue for more than ten days, it will be punished according to law. Businesses that are closed or newly opened in the spring should still report truthfully for tax assessment and determination.

(C) The simplified method will still be used for public utilities to levy business tax in the spring. Companies that are large in scale and have sound systems will not participate in the simplification and will be handled according to the declaration and assessment procedures.

Director Zhao: The Public Works Bureau's responsibility for public utilities lies in urging each company to maintain operations and improve efficiency. As for the impact of currency devaluation, neither the municipal government nor the Public Works Bureau can do anything about it. To ensure the continued maintenance of public utilities, they must have the ability to regenerate, that is, to ensure that company revenue is not affected by currency devaluation within the possible range, otherwise, they will inevitably fall into stagnation. In the past, the economic aspects of various public utility companies depended entirely on large loans from the Central Bank to get through. The Central Bank said that the amount of loans was becoming increasingly large, and its strength was insufficient, so it repeatedly stated that unless public utilities could find a self-sufficient price, it would no longer lend money in the future. In desperation, the municipal government had to change the pricing method to achieve balance in order to continue providing public utility services in the future. At the beginning of the proposal to adopt the unit pricing system for public utilities, the municipal government initially had no fixed idea of what value to use as a standard. Later, when the Central Government announced a new financial reform plan, it proposed to use 0.625 of a Customs Gold Unit as the pricing standard, which is actually equivalent to the value of one Gold Yuan (金圓券) during the "August 19th" period.

Willing to Accept Better Methods

Currently, the price of coal and fuel oil changes every day according to the exchange settlement bank rate, and in order to enable public utilities to regenerate, it is necessary to recognize the fact that their costs are rising every day. Moreover, the cost of living index is very close to the foreign exchange rate increase. After the implementation of the unit system for public utilities, the industrial and commercial sectors should not be unable to bear it because the prices of commodities have already risen with the currency devaluation rate at any time. For workers and those paid according to the employee index, the company can pay in advance, so they will not suffer losses. Those who cannot bear it are public school teachers and staff, but now that the Executive Yuan has approved that from March, salaries will be paid according to the cost of living index, so there should be no problem. However, the municipal government is still trying its best to reduce the burden on the general public, so it decided that large households can avoid currency devaluation by paying in advance, and the conversion rate for ordinary users is relaxed for seven days. In addition, the adjustment of public transportation prices will be kept flexible. When the new system was implemented, the original proposal was that the fare could be increased or decreased when the conversion rate exceeded 20% up or down, but after implementation, the number of passengers seemed to decline in the first two days, and it has gradually recovered in the past two days. However, for the convenience of citizens, even if the conversion rate exceeds 20%, the municipal government still notified the companies to temporarily postpone the change. If the City Council can provide insightful opinions that take into account both the burden on citizens and the maintenance of public utilities, the municipal government will be happy to accept, consider, and improve or correct the above measures.

Mayor Admits Wrong Choice of Words; Should Not Have Used the Words "Customs Gold Unit"

Mayor Wu: Every time public utility prices are adjusted, we always have to trouble everyone, and I really feel apologetic. The municipal government has never favored public utilities themselves. The reason why we want to maintain them is to maintain the lifeline of the citizens, because water and electricity are necessities of life. If Shanghai's water and electricity prices are compared with those in other parts of the country, they are indeed the lowest. Of course, raising prices will increase the burden on citizens, but if water and electricity are cut off, the suffering will be even greater. There are only two ways to maintain public utilities: one is to request subsidies from the central government, otherwise, they must be self-sufficient. In the past, public utilities were subsidized by the central government. Later, a new economic plan was announced, which explicitly stipulated that subsidies would be stopped in the future. The person in charge of the Central Bank also stated that the amount of loans for public utilities had been too large in the past and could not be supported. He asked Deputy Speaker Xu to tell Director Zhao that the prices of public utilities could be increased to achieve balance. I knew that I would be scolded after the new system was implemented, but I had to make this decision. What I should admit today is that I used the wrong wording. I should not have used the words "Customs Gold Unit", which would lead to the charge of destroying finance. In fact, the unit system was originally based on one Gold Yuan (金圓) from "August 19th" as the base. Strictly speaking, the increase in public utility prices is still lower than that of general commodities. If we use "August 19th" as the base period for statistics, the increase in commodity prices is 1250 times for cotton yarn, 1300 times for paper, 1785 times for oil, 1225 times for rice, and 1420 times for flour, while public utilities are only 980 times. Therefore, if the City Council believes that the increase in public utility prices is too high and can have a better way to reduce the burden on the people and continue to maintain public utilities, the municipal government is willing to accept it wholeheartedly and seek improvement.

Central Bank Has Always Strived to Subsidize Public Utilities

Central Bank Representative Chen Yanzuo: The Central Bank did not express opposition to the unit system for public utility prices at the time, or it can be said that it was equivalent to agreeing. Public utility prices must always be fair, and it is not a good policy to force them down. In the past, the Central Bank has always strived to subsidize public utilities. In February alone, the total amount of loans reached about 1 billion yuan before and after. Later, due to various difficulties, it had to be terminated. The Central Bank has done its best in this regard. Moreover, the central government has full power over loans, and the Central Bank has no right to decide.

Speaker Expresses Opinion, Hopes for Central Government Loans

Speaker Pan: The increase in public utility prices should not be blamed on the municipal government, the Public Works Bureau, or the Central Bank, because they are all powerless. The Central Bank does not want to issue banknotes. In short, the war will not stop for a day, and it will not be possible to reduce expenditures. Today we are seeking a solution in a helpless situation. The current problem lies in: (1) the base problem - which can be studied by the subcommittee, (2) the multiplier problem - if the cost of living index is used as the standard, it should be adjusted every half month, and the current difficulty lies in how to compensate for the difference between the period after the publication of the first phase index and before the publication of the second phase index. I believe that the central government should be asked for help, taking into account that the people of Shanghai are really unable to bear the burden, and asking the central government to lend public utilities the cost of buying fuel for half a month to maintain the company.

Pricing in Customs Gold Units Will Inevitably Create a Misunderstanding

Xu Xueyu: Pricing public utilities in Customs Gold Units is absolutely inappropriate. I suggest using the cost of living index as the standard and first determining a reasonable base price. To compensate for the disconnection between the upper and lower phase indexes, the payment period can be limited, and overdue payments must be paid according to the lower phase index. If the difference between the cost of living index and the exchange settlement increase is too large, the base can be adjusted appropriately. Zhang Zhongyuan: Suggests (1) Please ask the municipal government to abolish the settlement of public utilities in Customs Gold Units from today to benefit currency credibility and maintain people's livelihood. (2) Please ask the supervisory committee to investigate whether the competent authorities have colluded with the company. Zhang Zhihan: Pricing in Customs Gold Units will inevitably create a misunderstanding. The Gold Yuan is equivalent to having a name but no substance.

Since We Cherish Subsidies, Why Issue Large Banknotes?

Jiang Haoran: Advocates setting a base and using the cost of living index as the adjustment standard. Qu Yue: Advocates restoring the subsidy policy, unless the Central Bank announces today that it will no longer issue new banknotes from now on, otherwise the losses of public utilities should be resolved by the Central Bank. Li Wenjie: (1) What should be condemned is the central government's policy. Why are large banknotes constantly issued, and why are we only cherishing these small amounts of subsidies for public utilities? (2) The price of public utilities should be adjusted based on the cost of living index, and the difference should be paid by the Central Bank. Zhou Xiangsheng: The government should take into account the burden on the people, and the loan should be continued.

Where Did the Past Deposits Go?

He Chengfu: (1) According to the Public Works Bureau's statistics, one degree of electricity requires one kilogram of coal. Why doesn't the Public Works Bureau find a way to save electricity, so that it can save coal? (2) When public utility companies cannot maintain operations, citizens can pay in advance, but they should never be priced in Customs Gold Units. Zhu Fuyu: According to statistics, before the war, the price of electricity in this city was equivalent to more than one cent in US dollars per degree, and today it has reached more than five cents. Why has the cost increased four times? Therefore, the public utilities themselves should be reviewed. Yu Shun: Where did the electricity deposits and guarantees paid by citizens in the past go? This should be investigated.

### Unable to Cope with Buying Coal and Oil; Public School Teachers and Staff Are Anxious About Not Receiving Several Periods of Allotments

The daily necessities allotted to public school employees throughout the city by the Public School Employee Material Supply Committee of this city, except for rice, sugar, and salt, can still be supplied monthly without shortage. As of March, coal briquettes have been delayed for three periods (January, February, and March), totaling six dan, and cooking oil has been delayed for four periods (December, January, February, and March), totaling twelve catties. If each is valued at the current market price, the two items are worth more than 50,000 yuan. Since March and April, the meager monthly income of public school teachers and staff has been almost exhausted by buying coal and oil, and they are unable to cope. Recently, employees of various agencies have been asking "When will oil and coal be supplied" every day, hoping that the authorities can take into account the difficulties of poor public school teachers and staff, and urge the Supply Committee to order the Coal Adjustment Committee and the Zhongzhi Oil Factory to allocate physical goods in the shortest possible time, or promptly issue the difference in cash at market prices.

### Yongjia Road Robbery Case; One Criminal Arrested in Ningbo

[Our Newspaper's Report] On the 20th of last month at about 10:15 pm, two masked robbers broke into the home of Shi Zhang Xuezhi at No. 25 Heng'an Lane, Yongjia Road, over the back wall. They threatened the maids and servants in the house with guns and locked them in a small room on the chess board, arbitrarily searching and robbing. They stole a gold necklace with a chicken heart pendant, a solitaire diamond ring, two gold rings, two pairs of pearl earrings, a gemstone ring, and a radio. The victim shouted loudly on the balcony, and the robbers threw the radio on the side of the road and fled. At about 11 o'clock, the victim reported the situation to the Lujiawan Police Station. Chief Song immediately ordered the section chief and patrol officer Jiang Zhaolong to supervise police officers Li Zihua and Xu Xiangyun to mobilize overnight and search in the territory's hostels, but without any clues. However, according to the original owner, on the third day of the Lunar New Year, a fellow villager Zhang Yaohui, accompanied by two strangers, came to the house to pay New Year's greetings, and the two left soon after, and Zhang had stayed for two nights. Patrol officer Jiang believed that Zhang Yaohui was suspected, so he sent police officers to pay attention to the arrest. He then learned that Zhang had returned to his hometown and now lived at No. 90 Tongqing Lane, Gongwei Road, Ningbo. On the 5th of this month, he also sent officers to rush to Ningbo and, together with local police officers, arrested the criminal Zhang at his address and brought him back for interrogation. He confessed to participating in the robbery and also confessed that his accomplice Yang Jun, who was keeping watch at the door, was hiding at No. 88 Male Lane, Zhongzheng East Road. Later, the case-handling police officers arrested him at his address. The gunman Zhu Shijun is still at large and is currently being pursued.

### Police Officers Collude in Repeated Extortion; Eight Defendants Sentenced After Retrial

[Our Newspaper's Report] Police officers Wang Huaizan and Shao Yongfang, together with Lou Zhiqing, plainclothes police officer of the Xincheng Police Station, and Wu Chunhua, uniformed police officer, Song Wanfu, plainclothes police officer of the Hongkou Police Station (who has been sent to the District Court for separate handling), and Qian Mingsan and four others who are at large, on the afternoon of January 12 last year, entered Wang Jifu's home under the pretext of investigating the household registration, and then extorted two diamond rings and a watch from Wang's wife under the pretext of searching for opium. On April 6 of the same year, they also went to Chai Teng's home with Luo Shiwei, a police officer of the Laozha Police Station, and He Guoping, a member of the Flying Fortress Team, and Gu Deben, a firefighter, and used the same method to force them to hand over two gold chopsticks, thirty-five silver dollars, more than a hundred silver dimes, and many gold bracelets, gold chains, diamond rings, jade, and other ornaments. On the 22nd of the same month, Wang and others, together with Wang Zhiwei, a police officer of the Songshan Police Station, and Chen Yuting, who was engaged in making cakes, went to the room of Wang Yumei of the Zhongdetang Pharmacy and searched it extensively using the same method.

### Laundromat Returns Gold Ring Lost in Clothes; Ya Guang Factory Commendable for Honesty

A colleague of this newspaper recently took clothes to the Ya Guang Dyeing Factory on Xinzha Road for washing and dyeing. He forgot for a moment to take out the two gold rings in his pocket.

In this degenerate world, the factory is commendable for its honesty.

### Gu Haitao Sentenced to Two Years of Imprisonment with Suspension for Extortion of the Owner of Fuxing Tobacco Company

[Our Newspaper's Report] Judge Qian Songsen of the District Court yesterday concluded and announced the verdict in the case of Gu Haitao and others extorting money from Ding Yuanqing and Ding Yuquan, the owners of the China Fuxing Tobacco Company: Gu Haitao was sentenced to two years of imprisonment with a two-year suspension for jointly seeking illicit gains by taking advantage of opportunities for matters that are not under his jurisdiction or supervision.

The defendant and Gu Hongliang, Zhu Yonglin, and others learned in January 36 that Ding Yuanxiang and Ding Yuquan were suspected of being traitors and were being tried by the court. They conspired with Yuan Hongjue, the former group leader of the Second Hall of the Ministry of National Defense, and others to falsely report to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters in Yuan's name that there were communist bandits rioting in Shanghai. After finding out the location, they would report by telegram again, and at that time, they would ask for assistance, etc. Yuan promised to the ministry, and on the morning of the 8th of the same month, he led Gu and others to the Fuxing Company and threatened Ding Zipanquan under the name of investigating communist bandits and traitors, and also called the inspector general of the inspection department of the police department to report that the previously reported communist bandits had now been detected, and asked them to send personnel to arrest them as soon as possible. He deliberately did not indicate the location and hung up the phone, so that the department could not send personnel to the department in order to achieve the purpose of jointly defrauding money. Later, he told the company that if it could donate 200 gold bars, it could guarantee that nothing would happen. The company knew that they were false and reported the matter to the Garrison Headquarters, which arrested Yuan and Gu, and the remaining criminals were at large. In addition to Yuan being tried by military law, Gu Haitao was transferred to the District Court for judgment as above.

### The Unstable Reality in Southwestern Guizhou

— Our Reporter Liu Mengchi

[Our newspaper, Guiyang, 1st] Today's Guizhou, situated in the gap of neighboring provinces' laissez-faire attitude, spends its difficult and hard years. Although the authorities have the determination of loyal officials and unfortunate sons, using a constant attitude to respond to all changes, hoping to drag through this turbulent situation in the Central Plains, the short-sighted people, seeing that the people of other provinces have enough to eat and drink and act arbitrarily, only care about the immediate benefits, regardless of the consequences in the future. Moreover, ambitious people everywhere instigate and call, and ignorant villagers are of course easy to rise up and stir up trouble. This is most evident in the rampant banditry in the southwestern counties of Guizhou recently, which is really enough to make the Guizhou authorities, who have always been known for their stability, feel headache and烦恼.

Southwestern Counties of Guizhou

are bordered by Tianxi, Xilong, Leye, and Tian'e in Guangxi, and Luoping, Shizong, Pingyi, and Zhan益 in Yunnan. It can be said that the banditry in the border area of these three provinces of Qian, Gui, and Dian has never been completely suppressed since the Republic of China. In that area, local chieftains ran rampant, officials were corrupt, and the people could not make a living, so they had to go to "Liangshan." Although they robbed homes and houses, they rarely killed or set fires. Such bandits, at most, only disturbed the people and made the local area uneasy. In recent years, since communist elements such as Zhu Jiabi and He Zhengping led students with ambitious ideas from the Southwest Associated University to participate in the bandit movement in the border area of the three provinces of Dian, Qian, and Gui, they superficially sympathized with the poor and weak people, secretly colluded with local chieftains, gentry, and all evil forces, and slowly instilled political thoughts and political propositions into the minds of those bandit leaders who only knew how to rob homes and houses in the past. As their power grew day by day, their ambitions grew day by day, and they have evolved to the point where this border area of the three provinces can be said to have long become a world where bandits run rampant.

The southwestern counties of Guizhou are under the jurisdiction of the Xingren Special Office of the Third Administrative Inspectorate District. The neighboring Xingyi County was formerly known as "Huangcaoba" and is known for producing opium.

This is the Source of Bandits

Recently, counties such as Xingren, Xingyi, Ceheng, Wangmo, Panxian, Puan, Qinglong, and Guanling have been plagued by bandits everywhere, travelers have been stopped, and even the Kunming-Zhijin National Highway has been blocked, and postal and telecommunications services have been intermittent, creating an unfortunate situation where the government controls the county seat and the bandits control the countryside, all due to opium. To sum it up in one sentence, other provinces are planting, but Guizhou insists on eradicating; the people insist on planting, but the government insists on eradicating; and ambitious people call on their followers to use armed force to protect the people's planting of opium, thereby coercing ignorant villagers to rebel. As a result, banditry is getting bigger and bigger. Therefore, in Guiyang today, some people openly advocate "Guizhou should quickly lift the ban and allow the people to plant opium" under the pretext of "enriching provincial finances" in order to exonerate those opium bandits, and even say that it can therefore make the local order repeatedly stable. This is beside the point, but I mention it in passing.

Currently, the bandit situation in the southwestern counties of Guizhou is still

Most Serious in Panxian

When I reported on the security situation in the border area of the three provinces of Dian, Qian, and Chuan last time, I said that although the old nest of Long Tengxiao, the chieftain of the Nuozhai chieftain in Panxian, was occupied by the provincial and county teams, and he himself led the remnants to flee to Pingyi County in eastern Yunnan, it was still a big question whether he would take the opportunity to make a comeback. This opportunity did not disappoint Long Bandit. After he led the remnants to recuperate in Pingyi County, he re-established contact with bandit leaders such as Qian Baliang, Chen Yunfei, and Ding Yuesong, and returned to his old nest in the middle of this month, and attacked Tulu坝 between Panxian and Puan. Although there were only more than 200 people, it has already shaken the neighboring counties of Puan and Qinglong. Fortunately, the provincial and county teams worked hard and suppressed the bandits back to the southern area of Panxian. However, more than 1,000 bandits who had fled from the southern area of Panxian were recently discovered in the Qingshan area, which is 60 li away from the Xingren Special Office, armed with sophisticated weapons and with a sharp offensive. If these bandits were to gain power, they could occupy Xingren and Xingyi, and then respond to Ceheng and Wangmo. All the counties in the North and South Panjiang River basin will be greatly affected. Fortunately, after the provincial and county teams, under the supervision of Lu Jie, the special commissioner and deputy commander of the suppression of bandits in the southwest area, fought fiercely for a week, killing more than 200 bandits, capturing more than 100 bandits, and seizing more than 30 guns. The bandits returned to their old nest in Panxian to reorganize. Why did Long Tengxiao's ashes rekindle and his power become more and more powerful? One is that the county magistrate was newly transferred, and the deployment was lax. The other is that Wei Huanzao, the commander of the provincial security regiment responsible for the suppression, did not move in the Laochang area for nearly a month, which allowed the bandits to slowly recuperate and reorganize. Therefore, after the provincial government reviewed the results, it first transferred Wei to the Ministry for investigation and handling, and sent Jiang Zhongqing to take over and issue a telegram to suppress the bandits. Furthermore, since the local bandit forces have already had a slight political nature, military force alone cannot be effective. Recently, Zhao Fu is being carried out for Ding Yuesong, and a policy of differentiation has been adopted for Chen Yunfei and Qian Baliang, intending to separate them and carry out separate annihilation. If Long Tengxiao is once isolated and divided, Panxian may still achieve temporary stability.

Townships on the Border Between the Two Provinces

have never had a quiet life. Recently, it has been rumored that four or five townships in Xingyi County have been disturbed by Zhao Zong匪徒, and the residents are restless day and night. The two counties of Ceheng and Wangmo, located on the north bank of the Hongshui River on the Qian-Gui border, are often harassed by bandits from Leye, Tianxi, and Xilong in northern Guangxi. Not only do they constantly occupy townships, but even the county towns of Ceheng and Wangmo are under constant threat. The county town of Ceheng currently only has a company headquarters of the provincial security regiment stationed there. Not long ago, bandits from Xilong besieged the county town. Fortunately, the garrison troops held on firmly, and reinforcements arrived from the surrounding townships, and the bandits besieging the city retreated to their old nest in Xilong. The county town of Wangmo is guarded by the county government's standing civil defense detachment. The detachment leader, who is an Yi person, suddenly led his troops to rebel late at night on the Lantern Festival of the lunar calendar, besieging the county magistrate's bedroom. Fortunately, the county magistrate, Sha Yinghuang, was a soldier and was good at dodging, so he escaped in a hurry and led his bodyguards and armed police to defeat the rebels, but he had already suffered a great shock.

### Making Hangzhou Prosperous: From Ren Xianqun to Yu Jimin

— Our Reporter Huang Xingtian

[Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 6th] After the Guangzhou Executive Yuan meeting on January 17 decided to reassign Zhou Shu as the chairman of Zhejiang Province, Ren Xianqun, a capable cadre under Chen Yi, immediately resigned from his positions as the mayor of Hangzhou and the director of the Materials Utilization Committee to Chairman Chen.

Ren Xianqun Farewell Party

Mr. Chen Gongqia, who was delayed by the "February 28th" incident, when he rose again in Zhejiang, he came to his hometown with full enthusiasm and hope to serve the elders, ready to do a great career. (He spent eight months formulating a ten-year plan for Zhejiang's economic construction), while Ren Xianqun came to Hangzhou with the same spirit, becoming a faithful implementer of Chen's ideals. Therefore, although Ren's administration of Hangzhou was only a short 80 days, its impression was deeply imprinted in the minds of the 500,000 citizens of Hangzhou. When Ren left Hangzhou with Chairman Chen, the citizens of Hangzhou saw him off with warm emotions. This emotion was expressed at the farewell party held at the Pacific Theater, the largest cinema in Hangzhou. The farewell meeting was chaired by Mr. Zheng Xiaocang, dean of the Teachers College of Zhejiang University, who expressed his infinite regret for the hasty departure of the two. The rostrum of the meeting was filled with various dazzling banners, and the people's representatives from various districts came to present banners. Moreover, one citizen volunteered to speak, and as a result, he said: "The government has been shouting about revolutionary nation-building for more than 30 years. Only Chairman Chen and Mayor Ren have truly practiced revolutionary nation-building and are truly officials who seek the welfare of the majority." I have never seen such a spontaneous and high-spirited emotion at various "farewell official meetings."

Middle School Students Talk About Good Officials

After Ren left office, the Hangzhou-based reporters, in order to express their regret, broke the rules and invited the official to dinner, but because there were too many banquets, they changed to eating noodles in the morning. Poor reporters were willing to spend so much money to banquet an official because the sincerity and spirit of the public servant truly touched their hearts. A few days later, I accidentally heard two junior high school students chatting in front of the West Lake Museum, talking about the outrageousness of prices and the abominable corrupt officials. I asked them if Mayor Ren was a corrupt official? They said in unison: "Mayor Ren is a good official." I further asked them what was good about Mayor Ren? Their answer was quick: "Mayor Ren does things for our common people, so he is a good official." Another added: "He can fight against the local tyrants and evil gentry, isn't he a good official?" I learned from their school badges that they were not students of the municipal middle school. Ren had already left, and of course he would not come to buy off 13- or 14-year-old middle school students to do personal publicity. Here, I deeply realized: "Winning the hearts of the people" is truly the greatest glory of being an official.

Winning the Hearts of the People in 80 Days

Ren Xianqun's administration of Hangzhou City lasted only 80 days. Where did he go to win the hearts of the people? The main reason is what the student said, being able to "do things for our common people," which is also what the Hangzhou Southeast Daily said: "That is, he is working for the majority of poor and suffering citizens." Under this basic principle, Ren first started from rectifying the city's finances and guaranteeing the lives of public educators, and then promoted construction work from social order, urban sanitation, etc. On the one hand, he submitted a memorandum to the Municipal Council, opening a credit check to complete eight construction projects in three months. On the other hand, he carried out the design work of modern urban construction based on the geographical environment and the needs of the citizens of Hangzhou, and followed the suggestions of the public opinion circle to establish a cultural city as the goal of future work. He took such a big picture, started from small places, followed public opinion, and was unwilling to be a "West Lake Mayor," but a real Hangzhou Mayor, working diligently for the majority of small people. This is the success of Ren's proclaimed responsible politics. Although some people criticized Ren for focusing too much on publicity in his work and going too far. The so-called "going too far" is just not pleasing to the eye. In fact, at a time when Chinese politics has reached the point of losing the hearts of the people, the most important thing is political effectiveness. As long as his goal is for the benefit of the people, it is not a problem. I think the problem is that Ren should not casually give up his unfinished work because of the advancement and retreat of his superiors. Of course, this is not only Ren's responsibility, but also involves the赘癌 in Chinese politics, the entire personnel problem.

Yu Jimin also serves as Mayor

After Ren left office, the provincial government ordered Secretary-General Xu Xiongfei to act as an agent. It was once rumored that Xuan Tiewu would be the mayor of Hangzhou, and it was also heard that the old mayor Zhou Qiyu would come back to do it again. As a result, at the first provincial government meeting chaired by Chairman Zhou on March 3, it was passed that Yu Jimin, a member of the provincial committee, would also serve as the mayor of Hangzhou. Yu Jimin is a native of Fenghua, Zhejiang, and is the brother of Yu Jishi. He graduated from the Beijing Advanced Police School and served as the inspector general of the Zhejiang Provincial Police Bureau, the director of the Ningbo Police Bureau, the magistrate of Yin County, the administrative inspector of the sixth district and the commander of the district security force, a member of the Shandong Provincial Government, and the director of the Shandong East Administrative Office. When Chen Gongqia was in charge of Zhejiang, Yu was transferred back to Zhejiang to serve as a member of the provincial government.

With魄力重視民意

After Ren's order was issued, Yu first returned to his hometown and made a trip, and scheduled to complete the handover on the 11th and formally take office. Before the trip, he briefly talked about governance, saying that everything would follow Chairman Zhou's instructions to first stabilize social order, and then proceed with construction according to priorities. According to Yu's humble statement: Because he had strongly resigned from this position, Chairman Zhou had repeatedly invited him before he reluctantly accepted the new order, so the governance program had not yet been considered. Yu not only graduated from the police school and has been engaged in police administration work for a long time, but also once served in Hangzhou police administration. Therefore, with Yu's talent, to stabilize the social order of Hangzhou, all circles believe that he is more than capable. As for the construction work, Yu's魄力做事 is even better than the previous one, and seeing that Ren is deeply loved by the people in Hangzhou, he must also follow public opinion and work hard for the majority of small citizens, so that he will not deviate from the goal of being a public servant. Before Yu took office, some citizens had publicly suggested that the new mayor should solve the housing shortage in the city, renovate the streets and alleys in the citizens' area, and engage in afforestation and fish farming in the West Lake. This can also be said to be the desire of the general public.

Firm Heart for Big Goals

What I think is worth mentioning is the "design of modern urban construction" that the previous term has not yet completed. The previous term followed the suggestions of the Municipal Council and the public opinion circle, and established the intention of building Hangzhou into a cultural city, and hired the famous scholar and President of Zhejiang University, Mr. Zhu Kezhen, to chair the Urban Planning Committee to conduct research and planning work. This is a far-sighted vision. No matter how the environment changes, and how weak the financial and material resources of the municipal government are, I think that for the sake of Hangzhou, for the sake of Zhejiang, and for the sake of China, the future rulers of Hangzhou should all aim at this big goal, with firm confidence, and take one step at a time, and do one thing at a time. This will not only win the hearts of the citizens of Hangzhou, but also benefit the people of the country.

Spring has come to the West Lake again. At the press conference held by Chairman Zhou on the lakeside in the bright spring sunshine, he said that he would thoroughly stabilize the social order of Hangzhou in order to attract tourists and prosper Hangzhou. But can Hangzhou only rely on the scenery of the lake and mountains and "rely on one spring for three winters" to prosper? If you want to make Hangzhou "spring all seasons" to prosper, then you must enrich the connotation and build it into a cultural city. The 500,000 citizens of Hangzhou are looking forward to such prosperity.

### Tracking Soldiers and Replenishing Soldiers: Corruption Arises in Changzhou

[Our newspaper, Wujin, 7th] In the Changzhou-based reception station of the Seventh Replenishment and Training Corps of the Ministry of National Defense, Long Debin, the company commander of the Tenth Company of the Second Battalion of the Second Regiment of the corps, along with squad leader Li Jiaxiang and sergeant Zhang Yonghong, used false replenishment and training names to specially engage in kidnapping innocent people, extorting and defrauding them of white rice ranging from 3 shi and 5 dou to 6 shi. More than 80 innocent people have been victimized successively. After the case was solved, company commander Long Debin, Li Jiaxiang, and Zhang Yonghong were detained by the city defense department. After days of interrogation, Zhang Yonghong confessed to the situation of defrauding property, obtaining rice, and releasing people without hesitation. Subsequently, more than 20 innocent people were found to be imprisoned in the corps' office. Among them, Song Jiuyuan and others, because they had no rice to redeem themselves, had already been put on military uniforms and were about to be sent to fill the ranks of soldiers. Fortunately, they were rescued, and their families came to prove their identities, and they were immediately released. More than 20 other people, including Chen Yaofeng, are waiting for the missing family members to prove their identities in the post. In addition, a note was found on the body of the key criminal Zhang Yonghong, which read, "...Now please talk to Boss Qian again about the number of 6 shi, and then decide, and hope to bother you. Your brother Jiaxiang." This is the physical evidence of the extortion in the case.

There was also a similar situation where they used the pretext of tracking down deserters to falsely accuse good people of desertion, and to extort property and rice, which was also cleverly solved. It happened that an army sent Captain Adjutant Squad Leader and seven or eight soldiers to Changzhou City along the river to catch deserters, but unexpectedly, they also indiscriminately arrested innocent people, similar to kidnapping. They successively captured 38 people including Lu Xin'an and Xu Wuda. Among them, Xu Wuda and others were extorted huge sums of money before they were released. Thirteen people, including Zhu Xiaolong, were imprisoned and treated as deserters because they had no money. After the replenishment and training corps case occurred, they were about to abscond, and were seized by the city defense department at the station on the 6th. The 13 victims were fortunately rescued and released. After being interrogated by the city defense department, the perpetrators directly admitted that they had used their power to arbitrarily kidnap and extort money. The department transferred the case to the pacification headquarters for review and handling because of the seriousness of the case.

Jurong

[Report from our newspaper] A certain reorganized unit has been stationed in Luoyang rural area for a long time, and the supplies are enormous, making it impossible for the villagers to bear. At first, they made excessive demands, then resorted to outright robbery. Although the facts have been repeatedly reported to the government, no concrete countermeasures have been taken. The villagers, finding it unbearable, took self-defense actions. On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, in Chenwuzhuang, where the township office is located, a fierce armed fight broke out between the military and the civilians, resulting in casualties on both sides. A thorough investigation of the truth is currently underway.

A review meeting will be held once a week, and representatives appointed by the local supervisory committee and the Ministry of Finance will be invited to attend and supervise. The National Bank has been actively organizing the Gold and Silver Price Stabilization Committee in accordance with the ministry's order. As for the attendees of the review meeting, in addition to Bi Delin, Director of the Gold Administration Bureau appointed by the Ministry of Finance, Liu Yantao, a member of the Control Yuan, and Lin Chongyong of the Central Bank will form a three-person group to conduct the review weekly. The committee will hold meetings every day at 12:00 noon to review the gold allocation prices and quantities for the silver firms, and the gold allocation can be issued that afternoon. Yesterday's allocation price was still 228,000.

[Report from our newspaper] Since being ordered to establish the Gold and Silver Price Stabilization Committee, the Central Bank continued to allocate raw gold needed by the city's silver firms yesterday. However, there were not many applicants, and a total of nine firms were allocated a total of 290 taels, with an allocation price of 228,000 yuan per tael. According to regulations, the deadline for silver firms to apply for gold purchases and settle payments is 1:00 p.m. on the same day. Yesterday, because it was the beginning of implementation of the allocation and sale, the firms were not yet familiar with the procedures, so the deadline was delayed until about 4:00 p.m.

### Selling Pressure Dominates the Market; Chinese Stocks Decline Across the Board

The Chinese stock market trend turned weak, and the entire process was almost completely dominated by selling pressure. Although it was once raised by major players in the middle, the market trend fell back into emergency operation due to strong selling intentions. Yesterday, the circle's monetary conditions continued to show tightness, with daily interest rates doing around 7.75%. Everyone saw it as a market decline. Yong Yarn opened at 4.90 yuan, and after opening, it fluctuated at a low level. The market trend was increasingly small. At around 10:00, major players from securities firms sold off in large quantities, and the market trend decreased to 4.85 yuan. Retail investors entered on the dip, and the market trend rebounded again, reaching a high of 5.06 yuan. At 11:45, major players sold off in large quantities at the high, and bank firms followed suit. The market trend plummeted again to 4.93 yuan at closing. The Mei Ya market continued to be sluggish, opening at 1.75 yuan, reaching a high of 1.80 yuan, and plummeting to a low of 1.58 yuan, closing at 1.62 yuan. The Gold Public Bonds were still hesitant due to rumors of the Central Bank continuing to sell gold, and the market trend softened. Transactions were also extremely quiet.

### Foreign Stocks: British American Tobacco Is the Only Strong Performer

Foreign stocks generally trended downwards due to the increasingly strong monetary conditions in the circle and the appreciation of the Hong Kong dollar. However, the market trend for British American Tobacco was uniquely prosperous due to the entry of foreign firms and Guang firms. Yih Yarn was trading at 8,700 yuan and 8,600 yuan, 400 yuan lower than the previous day. British American Tobacco was trading at 9,800 yuan, 400 yuan higher than the previous day. Asia Navigation was down 200 yuan, trading at 860 yuan and 880 yuan, with Jardine Matheson flat.

### Clearance Work for Legal Tender Public Bonds to End on the 11th of This Month

According to information from the Central Bank, the redemption and interest payment clearance work for legal tender public bonds has been largely completed since the authorities began processing it. It is now known that the financial authorities have decided to end this redemption and interest payment clearance work on the 11th of this month and will not extend it.

### Banking Association Agrees on Procedures for Reporting Lost Negotiable Instruments

[Report from our newspaper] The Banking Association noted that the number of returned checks has increased recently, and many parties do not follow the prescribed procedures for reporting lost negotiable instruments. Therefore, it was resolved by the standing council of the association that the following five procedures must be completed in order to apply for the return of lost negotiable instruments: (1) Application for stopping payment of a lost check, (2) Deposit slip for the check amount, (3) Guarantee document for the loss, (4) Application for the return of the deposited check amount, (5) Application for withdrawing funds from the lost negotiable instrument. After filling out the above five forms, the lost check amount will be temporarily frozen at the association. After all the procedures have been completed, an application for the return of the amount can be made to the association. It is now heard that the association is soliciting opinions from various banks on the measure, and it will be implemented as soon as a majority agrees.

### Silk Market Flat and Weak

The raw silk market condition yesterday was still hovering in a range. The trend was still flat at the opening of each range. Entrants were watching and trading was silent. Afterwards, the price of gold outside the circle rose, and cotton yarn rose after stabilizing first. People's sentiments were slightly stimulated, and the market trend rebounded. There was a slight closing increase at the end.

For 120 silk, there was a newly produced Shiny Brand commodity. The morning opened with the price of immediate cash commodity at 1.18 million. However, due to the urgency of cash in the circle, the implicit interest rate was as high as 85 yuan. People's sentiments were quite weak, and there was little desire for purchases. The market weakened and the market presented a revolving condition. Afterwards, the gold price exceeded the 240,000 mark, and the firms started to bid up the price. The desire to purchase slightly increased, and the market price gradually rose. The price once went up to 1.27 million. There was not much change until the noon closing. In the afternoon, the gold price rose again with interest, and many firms strongly supported the price. The market trend continued to be strong. The price for 120 silk was called at 1.3 million by Dongyang.

The raw silk market trend remained sluggish with the market's focus on foreign exchange. Firms supported the price, but trading was extremely weak due to the tight cash condition and high market interest rates. Supply and demand were both scarce, and trading was silent. D-grade 78 uniformity was offered at a price of 1.6 million in the morning. Firms started to offset their positions and the price was offered at 50,000 yuan higher. Afterwards, it was heard that the price of gold had increased and the foreign exchange trend was slightly firm. The price once increased to 1.72 million. After the high, the tight cash condition worsened and the implicit interest rate gradually increased. The firm's desire to sell became strong, and the market presented a weakening condition. The price was called at 1.7 million - 1.69 million near noon. Finally, the desire to purchase was still weak, and the market trend had no strength to rally. The noon closing was at 1.67 million.

The silk and satin trend was slightly weak yesterday, and the market price showed a slight decrease. Mei Ya opened in the morning with a sale price of 800,000. After opening, there was a hard pull, and the market price rose slightly by 100 yuan in the flat range. However, due to the excessive overnight interest rate, the bulls could not bear the burden, and there were still many sales in the market. The desire to purchase from the local customer firms was extremely weak, and the market trend could not stabilize due to weak people's sentiments. The price dropped back instantly, and was called between 780,000 and 790,000. Afterwards, the trend was flat and weak, and the price fluctuation range was narrow. It was still hovering around 785,000 yuan before the closing. Finally, it was heard that the gold price was still stable and the firms' sentiments were slightly good. The market trend slightly strengthened and the market price rebounded again, closing at 793,000 yuan.

### Money Market Tightens First and Then Eases; Gold and Currency Rebound in the Afternoon

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday in this city, at the beginning of the day, various sectors generally believed that the market would continue the sideways trend of the previous day, and rumors of official sales persisted. Therefore, there was widespread support, with overnight interest rates standing at between 8.5 and 9 cents. However, at around 11:00 AM, a large amount of settlement funds flowed out from the National Bank, and the money market gradually eased, falling to between 6.5 and 7 cents with ample supply. By around 12:00 noon, the money market had become completely loose and oversupplied, with banks offering 6 cents in full supply. After the opening of various industries at 1:30 PM, the easing trend in the money market did not stop, and the overnight interest rate further fell to 5 cents, with banks fully supplying funds. However, the government's sales operations, which were the focus of the speculative market, did not materialize yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, neither foreign exchange transfer certificates nor gold were seen being sold off by the National Bank, and the Hong Kong exchange rate began to shrink steadily in the morning. As the money market turned loose again, this caused gold and currency prices to rebound upwards in the afternoon.

Furthermore, the National Bank continued to issue a large amount of 129,315,000 yuan yesterday, foreign merchant banks issued 52,357,000 yuan, major clearing houses cleared in 177,185,000 yuan, and small clearing houses cleared in 4,487,000 yuan. It is heard that the large amount of funds issued by the National Bank yesterday was mainly due to a large amount of settlement funds from the China Trust Bureau, estimated to be about one billion yuan.

### Scattered Tea Market Transactions

Yesterday's tea market began in the morning with goods turning flat from the previous day's market. Coupled with the pressure from the money market, the industry, despite the lack of tea stocks and the continued support from sellers, was unable to increase prices. However, in the afternoon, gold, U.S. dollars, and foreign exchange transfer certificates showed improvement, and people's sentiments suddenly became excited. Sellers supported prices and refused to let go, and prices rose rapidly. Prices, however, lacked significant progress due to the varying quality of the goods, and, considering the overall transactions for the day, buyers were generally unable to get what they wanted, resulting in only scattered achievements.

### Tung Oil Rises in a Circuitous Way

Tung oil market conditions yesterday were generally affected by the authorities' sales of materials and tightening of the money supply, making traders confused. However, because sources from Wuhan were blocked and foreign exchange transfer certificates repeatedly reached record highs, prices did not fall, and instead continued to move forward in a circuitous way. In the end, fully measured white oil and genuine Xihong oil were trading at between 80,000 and 84,000 yuan. Second-grade Xihong oil and green oil also rose by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan.

### Light-Colored Woolen Fabrics Are Active

Standard prices for woolen fabrics have remained at a high level due to various factors inside and outside the industry, and most owners are optimistic about the future. According to historical ratios, one bolt of fancy suiting fabric could be exchanged for one dan of white rice, and in good times, could be exchanged for one bolt of Longtou fine cloth. Even with current price increases, they still cannot be exchanged for these items.

Yesterday, Xie Xin, Dacheng, and Yuanfeng fancy suiting fabrics were all advertised wholesale at 26,000 yuan per yard. Zhanghua, Hongxiang, Yinfeng, and Xinhua were all selling at 24,000 yuan. No. 55 and Shuangmao brand Zhongyuan serge were selling at 20,000 yuan. No. 1830 was selling at 17,500 yuan. Hongxiang No. 1 fancy suiting was going for 20,000 yuan, No. 2 for 17,000 yuan, Yuecheng palicos for 16,000 yuan, and Daguangming for 13,000 yuan. Actual transactions showed that light-colored goods were more active, which is due to seasonal reasons.

### Yarn Prices Fluctuate Little; Cotton Cloth Market Trend Hovers

The yarn market lacked the strength to rise. It opened slightly higher, and progress was seen at one point, due to scattered transactions from the Guangdong firms. The firms held on to their holdings and were reluctant to sell. Nearing noon, the internal cash flow in the industry remained tight, and people's sentiments were scattered. Many traders thought of releasing their stocks to see what would happen, and ultimately the market closed at the opening price.

42-count Lanfeng was done from 1.77 million yuan to a high of 1.83 million yuan, ultimately closing at 1.78 million yuan, up 80,000 yuan. Other counts such as Baoguang and Tiannv also rose around 80,000 yuan. 40-count Lanfeng rose 170,000 yuan, and 32-count Yinyue ultimately rose 20,000 yuan, ending at 1.22 million yuan.

3-count Shuangma spot goods opened in the morning at 920,000 yuan, reached a high of 960,000 yuan, and closed at noon at 917,000 yuan, rising 27,000 yuan overall. Factory orders are gradually leveling with spot goods. The last transaction yesterday was at 915,000 yuan. 20-count Shuangma rose slightly by 5,000 yuan, and each grade below 16-count showed a trend of both honor and disgrace.

The cotton cloth market presented a hovering scene yesterday. After opening, all cloths prospered briefly under the pulling of the table helper. As the volume leaving customer hands remained stagnant and many retail investors sold to lock in profits, the rising trend finally failed to continue. The price then gradually fell into a soft range, with the results varying slightly compared to the previous day.

Longtou fine cloth initially opened at 34,400 yuan, and after briefly reaching a high of 35,000 yuan, it immediately plunged, reaching a low of 33,600 yuan. The noon close slightly rebounded to 33,800 yuan, similar to the previous day, with no change in price.

Mid-range fine cloths such as Laba brand Tong and others revealed a bit of elegance. Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge rose from 33,400 yuan to 34,200 yuan, ultimately closing at 32,900 yuan, down 100 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong rose 1,100 yuan, ending at 33,500 yuan. Shilin cloth and other colored cloths mostly remained at their original levels without moving.

### Strolling Through the Market: Spectator's Corner

Hoarding Goods Is Not as Good as Lending at Interest; Hence the Amazing Strategy of High Interest Rates; Although One Can Be Amazed, More and More Gunpowder Is Buried

Some time ago, everyone said that high inflation was caused by high interest rates.

These days, with prices sluggish, everyone is again saying that high inflation is caused by high interest rates.

The past argument was not wrong. Because interest is added to the price of goods, it becomes part of the cost. Then, as the tide rises, so does the boat, and prices naturally rise even more.

The present argument is also not wrong. Because interest rates are too expensive, hoarding goods while bearing the interest does not necessarily generate profit. So, instead of bearing the risk of hoarding goods, it is better to lend at high interest rates and collect immediate interest.

However, interest rates and prices are both governed by the law of supply and demand. When there is a high demand for money, interest rates naturally rise. Why is there a demand for money? Naturally, it is for purchasing goods. So, when there is a high demand for money, there is also a high demand for goods. Therefore, when interest rates rise, prices must also rise.

Similarly, now because everyone thinks that lending at interest is more worthwhile than hoarding goods, there are fewer people who need goods, and therefore fewer people who need money. Prices have thus become flat and weak.

Precisely because prices are flat, everyone believes that hoarding goods is not as good as lending at interest. Therefore, everyone wants to lend, and the supply of money increases. With a high supply of money, interest rates should naturally decrease, thus making it easier to purchase goods and prices also easier to rise. Consequently, the demand for both money and goods increases, and both interest rates and prices rise.

Now, because interest rates are high, everyone is lending at high interest rates. That everyone is lending at high interest rates and prices are flat is already strange; that interest rates are not decreasing is even stranger. This kind of distorted situation is actually caused by the magical views and magical methods of the financial authorities.

It is said that the financial authorities currently hold a certain view: let interest rates rise above prices, and divert floating capital to lending. When everyone lends, hoarders will naturally be few, and prices will become flat and weak.

It is also said that last Saturday, the Central Bank, based on this view, secretly asked people to go to various commercial banks and underground money shops in the city and borrow funds as much as possible at black market interest rates. Trapped in the Central Bank, they secretly used high interest rate payments.

It is said that the interest rate that the Central Bank paid out was actually less than the price loss from selling real goods, and anyway, it only needed to print more banknotes and issue them.

This kind of thinking can truly be called non-thinking; this kind of method can also be called amazing. However, the impending crisis will therefore become greater, because:

(1) What is borrowed must be repaid. What is currently borrowed is mostly short-term borrowing. When it is repaid, the money market will suddenly ease; the impact will be great. This is what is meant by "can be collected but cannot be released."

(2) High interest rates must be because someone wants them. If no one wants them, they will not rise. Now the authorities are artificially raising interest rates; then, once prices rise, they will be doubled and added on. Therefore, it can be predicted that in the future, the general price of goods will not rise until the interest is treated as a loss. When the rise exceeds the interest and is treated as a profit, a rise will inevitably be more than double or triple. Ordinarily, because of interest, a slight rise is treated as a gradual fall. When it rises again by one or two times, the severity of that situation, and the wage problem at that time, can be self-evident.

(3) There is also something more terrifying: the speculative market originally moves forward two steps and retreats one step. Now the overnight interest rate is at least 5 cents or more. Each daily turn is a high profit. In seven or eight days it can be doubled. Therefore, in the future, speculative prices will be flat as a fall, but when the trend comes, they must rise three or four times before falling one or two times. With such large rises and falls, the newly rich can certainly not be discussed, but the newly bankrupt will be especially numerous, and the situation of touching one hair and moving the whole body is truly unbearable to think about.

We really admire the authorities' willingness to use their brains. But why do they only think of turning to drinking poison to quench thirst? Doing this will only increase the crisis and there is absolutely no possibility of relaxation.

### Tight Money, Few Entrants; Rice Prices Decline; Flour Mediocre, Coarse Grains Weak; Shantou Market Falls and Then Rises Again

The rice market lacked strength to rise and ultimately declined. At the opening, goods owners continued to push up prices, and prices once rose by 500 or 600 yuan. However, due to tight money and weak buying appetite, prices then fell. The North City market's white japonica rice closed at 25,000 yuan, down 500 yuan. Bo Dao also fell 500 yuan, closing at 24,500 yuan. Special Gao Geng and others all fell 500 yuan. In the South City, both thick and thin japonica rice fell 300 to 500 yuan. Arrivals in the North and South markets totaled 6,929 piculs.

Edible Oil

Prices were firm. The opening sentiment was very weak due to tight money. Vegetable oil once fell by 2,000 yuan, but then rebounded slightly. At the closing, vegetable oil was 93,000, and soybean oil was 96,000 yuan, each slightly up by 1,000 yuan. The supply of raw oil was scarce. It opened at 120,000 yuan, up 7,000 yuan alone. Small vehicle sesame oil was weak and declining. Sales of soybean cake were halted, falling by 500 yuan.

Flour

Remained flat. Due to the tightening of the money supply, manufacturers dumped more than 5,000 bags at the initial market, and the market trend once saw a low. Midway through, Tianjin firms fiercely absorbed supply, and the market trend suddenly turned firm. The price of bingchuan initially opened at 10,300 yuan, and the highest was once 10,550 yuan in the mid-market. The closing was slightly back down, trading at 10,460 yuan. Lao Che was done at 10,900 yuan, and the peak once climbed to 11,000 yuan. Bran was strong, up 50 yuan, and large package Fuxin was done at 8,450 yuan.

Coarse Grains

Mostly showed weakness. Under tight cash conditions, the first part of the session of the market, customer firms absorbed the market, and the market price barely stabilized. Late in the session, the market dropped to a declining condition, winter soybeans neared closing with a call price of 21,500 yuan. Short season soybeans were called for entry to the 20,000 range. Foreign firms absorbed raw peanuts and the market uniquely strengthened by 300 to 500 yuan. Sesame was flat, and red sorghum fell by 1,000 yuan.

### Mingqian Longjing Tea to Debut in Two Weeks

[Report from our newspaper] According to a reporter who is familiar with the tea industry, Longjing green tea, which is specifically sold domestically, is a large category. Although new products this year are produced everywhere, they cannot be launched simultaneously due to soil and climate relationships. Among them, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, is the earliest to develop. It is heard that "Mingqian Longjing" will be produced in about two weeks. It is also known that tea merchants in the producing areas have been actively planning production and sales matters in recent days. However, due to the impact of the sharp increase in all expenses this year, the cost is definitely not low. As a result, the attitude of the suppliers is more stubborn than in the past, and the overall picture has been completely changed. It is expected that when the market opens, it will definitely create a shockingly high peak.

### Sixth District Cotton Textile Association Opposes In-Kind Collection of Yarn Tax

[Report from our newspaper] The Sixth District Cotton Textile Association previously saw in the newspaper that Article A, Section 6 of the Financial Reform Plan of the Ministry of Finance, regarding the in-factory tax collection for goods tax on cotton yarn and other products, would collect actual goods. After discussions by the standing council of the association, they unanimously expressed their opposition and submitted separate requests to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to exempt it from implementation. The reasons for their opposition are as follows: (1) Article 1 of the Gold Yuan Issuance Measures states that the currency of the Republic of China shall be based on the Gold Yuan as the standard currency, and it was announced that all public and private accounting shall be handled in Gold Yuan units from the date of promulgation. Now, only half a year later, the value of the currency has been depreciating daily. Financial reform should first establish currency credibility to seek a balance in fiscal revenue and expenditure and to improve the lives of the people. However, changing the ad valorem goods tax to in-kind collection is tantamount to showing the people to despise the currency and value goods. The resulting abuses will greatly affect the people's trust in the Gold Yuan. (2) The accumulated malpractices of in-kind collection of land tax have already resulted in more losses than gains. Now that the government has resolutely stopped it, it is showing a new start with the people. Turning suddenly at this time to change the tax law and change the goods tax to in-kind collection, this measure seems to undermine national credibility. The government only seeks to increase tax revenue but neglects the survival of the production industry, which seems to be greatly contrary to the government's original intention of supporting industry. (3) The expenses of all industries are all recorded in Gold Yuan units. The goods tax should be paid in Gold Yuan in accordance with the law and should not be changed. (4) As for the change of the goods tax to in-kind collection, if it is said that the aim is to control materials, control the market, to contract currency circulation and suppress prices, then the government has repeatedly sold off a large amount of materials, which has not been effective. As far as cotton yarn is concerned, all substitute spun yarn and US aid yarn, which are controlled by the Central Bank, account for more than 70% of the total output. Therefore, the government is sufficient to exert the power to control the market and suppress prices, so there is no need to drain the pond to catch all the fish, and also destroy the only fragile foundation of the textile industry. It is also heard that the association has sent separate letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Industries to advocate for strong support.

### Sports World; Shanghai Police to Battle Fluorescent Today for Democratic Cup Final Spot

The Shanghai Police and Fluorescent football teams are scheduled to play in the Democratic Cup semi-final at the South City Stadium at 4 PM today. Wang Lin will be the referee, with Fu Tanrongsheng and Xu Guoliang as linesmen. Tickets are priced at 300 yuan. The strengths of both sides are evenly matched, making the outcome difficult to predict. The Shanghai Police have a strong frontline, with Liu Longxin's shots being particularly sharp. Fluorescent also has a well-rounded team with a good playing style. Their strong defense is more than capable of thwarting the opponent's attacks. Today's match will determine not only the middle-level championship but also whether they can be promoted to the senior level. The lineups announced by the representatives of the two teams yesterday are recorded below:

Shanghai Police

Jing

Gu Zhenji, Ma Bingzhang, Wu Chengmei

Dai Wende, Xu Zhongfa, Yang Yimin, Lu Ding, Li Ziyun

Li Guoqiang, Zhang Zhen, Zhang Yi, Shi Jiuquan, Liu Long, He Zeng

Fluorescent

Zheng Tongyu

Zhang Gaozhen, Wang Qi, Hu Bingzhu

Zhu Wenbin, Xu Buyun, Tao Tingfu, Yu Qiaxing

Wu Pengfei, Yang Hengxue, Zhou Benfang, Gu Dirong, Li Kuncai, Li Minghua

Yesterday's match between Pan Team and Public Transportation was postponed due to the field being too wet and will be rescheduled for this Friday at 4 PM. As for the originally scheduled match for this Friday, it will be moved to next Tuesday (the 15th) at 4 PM.

### World Record in 100-Meter Breaststroke

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 7th] German spring swimming champion Kleinje set a new world record in the 100-meter breaststroke today with a time of 1 minute 7.1 seconds, shaving two-tenths of a second off the previous record held by American Ho.

### Annual Meeting of the Chinese Sports Federation Today

The annual meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Secondary School Sports Federation is scheduled for 6:30 PM today at the South City Sports Stadium to discuss all activities and competitions for the current semester. All member schools are requested to send representatives to attend on time.

### British Navy to Wage War Again; Friendly Match with Longtou Today

In a Sino-British friendly football match, the British Navy's London Fleet will launch an attack for the second time, meeting the city's strong Chinese football team, Longtou, at Yiguo at 4 PM today. Tickets are priced at 400 yuan for general admission and 600 yuan for special admission. Sales will begin at 2 PM at the entrance of Yiyuan.

Longtou has gathered talented players under the command of Northeast Wind, rising in the coastal area. They were frustrated in the A-League and suffered an unfavorable start in the Mayor's Cup, being eliminated by Zhichao, which is unfortunate. However, upon inspection, the team is very complete. Zheng Bingyi in defense, Wang Baoshan in the center, and Chen Qin in the inner forward line are considered the three heroes. Others such as Wu Kaimin, Zhang Jiliang, Jiang Xian, and Xia Shufu are all experts in their respective positions. With a neat formation and good cooperation, their strength should not be underestimated.

The British Navy drew with the Railway team last week, but the team maintained a one-goal lead until a few minutes before the end, when the Railway team equalized. Furthermore, the foreign general Bo Beiqi was injured and left the field, leaving only ten players in the second half. Otherwise, the Railway team would have had difficulty reversing the decline. This shows their bravery and skill. The team is particularly outstanding for the speed with which the ball reaches the players. Longtou must pay a considerable price to destroy this team. A fierce and intense battle is to be expected.

### Celebrating Malaysian Victory; Singapore Plans to Build Stadium for Next Competition

[Singapore Airmail] The Malayan badminton team has shocked the world of sports by defeating the American and Danish teams in its distant expedition to Europe. This is not only the glory of Malaya, but also the glory of our overseas Chinese, because the eight athletes from Malaya and team leader Lin Quanyu are all Chinese. It is more accurate to say that they represent China rather than Malaya. Now, the Malayan badminton team has lived up to expectations, eliminating the American and Danish teams in a whirlwind fashion, bringing the gold Thomas Cup, worth 1,700 pounds, back to Malaya. For this reason, enthusiastic people in Singapore are preparing to organize a grand ceremony to welcome the triumphant return of the team.

Since the news of the victory came from London a few days ago, no fewer than a hundred congratulatory telegrams have been sent from Singapore alone, including those from the Governor and the Deputy Secretary, not to mention those from the mainland of the Federation of Malaya. However, many enthusiastic people believe that this is not enough to express their enthusiasm for celebration. They believe that donations should be made as soon as possible to help the team's expenses, because the team still lacks about 10,000 yuan. In addition, it is necessary to raise funds to build an indoor badminton hall for the next (1952) Thomas Cup competition. Moreover, Zeng Zhicheng, vice chairman of the Singapore Badminton Association, told reporters yesterday that he has already called a meeting of various people to discuss how to hold a grand triumphal parade to welcome the athletes who have won the world badminton team championship representing Malaya, and to send a band to the pier or airport to meet them.

Legislative Councilor John Laycock suggested that the governments of Singapore and Malaya jointly organize a grand welcome party. Laycock said that this little-known Malaya is not only famous for its rubber and tin, but also for its outstanding badminton, which will make it famous in Europe and America. Laycock added: "I personally wish to donate 1,000 yuan to prepare a feast to celebrate the victorious return of the Malayan badminton team, and I hope that the government will announce a systematic plan as soon as possible to raise funds from all walks of life to quickly build a modern badminton hall."

Many people are now puzzled as to why Malaya (including Singapore) has such excellent badminton talents, but still does not have suitable badminton court facilities. When the world's badminton players come to compete for the next Thomas Cup in three years, how will they be accommodated? Because the three-year period is not too far away, preparations should be made as soon as possible.

### Joe Louis Autobiography (5)

— Translated by Cang Long

But when I was assigned to various overseas locations, I encountered the same kind of sad events. I went through the Aleutian Islands, Africa, and England with a large group of boxers. In March 1944, in Salisbury, England, I wanted to buy a ticket at a private theater. The female ticket seller apologized because the American military commander in that area had instructed that only white soldiers were allowed into the theater, and black soldiers were strictly prohibited. Later, this matter was reported to Major General John Lee, who was then General Eisenhower's deputy. After an investigation, the commander who established this rule in the area was immediately transferred back home. At the same time, the General Headquarters of the Expeditionary Force immediately issued an order stating that if any place prohibits American soldiers from entering, then this prohibition applies to all American soldiers, not just black soldiers.

While overseas, I visited England, Scotland, Africa, Italy, etc. When I was just a poor kid in Detroit, I never thought I would see these places.

In 1943, Marva gave birth to a girl in Chicago, whom we named Jacqueline, and she is now five years old. There is also a boy named Joe Jr., who was born in 1947 and looks a lot like me.

Even before I joined the army, Marva talked to me about retirement. She said that I had already achieved enough fame and fortune. I had held the heavyweight championship for the longest time in boxing history, and I had made many friends. She said that if I continued to cling to it, one day someone would beat me, and the reputation I had struggled for all my life might be ruined. My manager also said the same thing to me. He wanted me to retire at the same time as my championship title.

I often played bowling, but most of the time, I spent playing golf.

I thought that if I no longer engaged in boxing, then with all the money and property I had now, as well as the income from exhibition matches, I could live a very good life. I also had my businesses, such as Joe Louis Enterprises, which was doing very well. Joe Louis Beverage Company's products were selling well in 31 cities in the United States and in South America. I was also the vice president of a senior life insurance company, and I organized the Joe Louis Youth Club and served as a director of the club.

I opened a Chicago Automobile Business School in a car dealership in Chicago. I didn't want to make money from this school. Anyone can enroll, but I still liked to teach those black students. These students often had a harder time finding jobs than white students after leaving school. I especially wanted to give a chance to kids like me, kids who would only rely on their hands to work.

I didn't want to continue boxing. I knew that if I dragged on, I would eventually suffer a setback. Everyone should think that one day they will be defeated. So, aside from exhibition matches, if I signed a contract to fight someone again, then that fight would definitely be the last one in my boxing career. (End)

### Football Commentary Last Week

— Qi Gong

Last week's Mayor's Cup football semi-final produced the biggest miracle in three years. The defending champion and undefeated team for three years, Qingbai, was eliminated by China Aviation, with a score of 2 to 1.

The Railway team, with the ambition to win the Mayor's Cup, defeated Zhiqi Association 3 to 1 to win the final. The two teams are scheduled to hold the final this weekend to determine who is the new champion. Qingbai's defeat means that the Railway team has lost a strong opponent, and they can rest easy. But it remains to be seen this weekend whether China Aviation will invite several strong players from Hong Kong to help them in Shanghai.

The two semi-finals showed the low level of football in Shanghai, lacking wonderful performances, but the battles were quite tense. The young players were particularly hardworking, trying their best from the start to the last minute. In addition to working hard, China Aviation relied on some luck to beat Qingbai. Zhichao lacked luck and was overwhelmed by the more experienced Railway team. The processes of the two battles are commented on below.

"Do not indulge small enemies, do not deceive young players"

Qingbai's defeat was due to the mistakes mentioned above. Before the match, they did not take China Aviation, which had been repeatedly defeated recently, seriously. Their spirit was somewhat relaxed. Furthermore, their state was not good, and the generals were distracted. Although their offense was strong, they failed to deliver the final blow to China Aviation's spirit. As China Aviation's young players' style of play became smooth, and the midfield was controlled by China Aviation, Qingbai's goal was filled with the sounds of Chu songs.

Qingbai's defense still had a steady performance. Sanmao was the best in the team. Qingbai's forwards lacked the power to attack, and their coordination was scattered. Liu Long was not a center forward material and temporarily filled this position, acting slowly. Xiao Gu was good at dribbling, served as a winger but lacked the skill of crossing, and Ti Yin lost his form. Lu Sheng's performance was far below his usual level. Only Xiao Luo fought alone, how could he fight against the crowd? Although they had fifteen corner kick opportunities, there was no forward who was good at using headers, which can be said to have missed fifteen good opportunities. The inability of the forwards led the defenders into a bitter battle. China Aviation only had two best opportunities, and was able to grasp them. Gao Xiuqing bypassed the clumsy Meng Yiliang, and in a flat shot, Yin Qingbing passed the ball through a triangular formation, deciding Qingbai's fate in the last two minutes of the game, shattering Qingbai's dream of winning two championships. In the second half, Qingbai relied on Jin Lusheng to knock on the door from a very narrow angle, the ball sliding into the net from the side of the post, becoming 1 to 1. There was hope of turning defeat into victory, and they continued their offense for several minutes, but Xu Fusheng had a steady performance and some luck. "The goal is as deep as the sea," and the defenders fought hard, Qingbai's forwards had no way to get in. Meng Yiliang closely marked the fast-running Xu Zuguo, Yin Qingbing avoided the electric heart and detoured from the left to score, avoiding the solid and attacking the weak, making Huang Shijie unable to cope.

China Aviation's victory was achieved through the efforts of the entire army. Jin Chuanhan devoted himself to his duty, Xie Xichuan had one of his best performances this season, Chen Xiaoping was old and experienced, like an old horse who knows the way. At critical moments, he was able to seize the opportunity, preferring to kick the ball out of bounds rather than let Qingbai's forwards have the opportunity to control the ball and shoot. Therefore, he personally gave Qingbai seven corner kicks. If Qingbai had won against China Aviation by taking advantage of the corner kicks, then the blame would be on Xiaoping. However, Qingbai failed to attack repeatedly in the corner kick opportunities, because since Qu Yongfu retired, the skill of heading has not been continued. This has also contributed to Xiaoping's accidental success. Therefore, Xiaoping's merits and demerits are in the hands of Qingbai. In short, in terms of strength, China Aviation is not as good as Qingbai, but unfortunately Qingbai failed to maintain its state, and China Aviation relied on courage and luck.

Good strategy, Railway wins Zhichao

It is most unwise to attack firmly against firmly. The Railway team had considered carefully before facing Zhichao. In the match, they avoided the solid and attacked the weak, avoiding Wu Qixiang, who was in the center, and used skilled small "passes" to control the midfield. The offense was then launched from both wings. In military terms, this is to attack the place that is not easy to defend. Wu Qixiang was in the center, and his whip could not reach. The first goal was lost because Lin Dianxi lured Qixiang out and crossed the ball, Zhang Jie passed it again, and Wu Binghao pushed it in. Although the two wings flew together, it was also due to the ability of the two wings to cut in. The Railway team could have had the hope of a 3-0 score, because Dianxi was too hasty and shot the goal post. Zhang Jie was worried about gains and losses, heading the ball straight into Sheng Bide's arms. This was a threatening offensive by the Railway's three armies. The second goal was lost due to Qixiang's carelessness, he was confident in his unique skills, and no one dared to approach him. Who would have thought that Ziwen would suddenly emerge from the side and score the goal? Zhichao's defense only collapsed after Qi Qun was transferred from defense to center forward, resulting in the loss of the third goal. If Qixiang had not taken the position of forward, then Zhichao would have lost at most two goals, and their morale would not have been affected by the small defeat. However, after Qixiang went out, morale was depressed and the formation was shaken. Although they managed to pull back one goal, it was still not enough to offset the loss of morale.

The most noteworthy were Wu Qixiang and Gao Baozheng's wonderful performances as the third inner defense. They kicked and headed, and their footprints could be seen almost everywhere in the hinterland of both sides. They rescued the dying and helped the injured, and made the greatest contribution. The Railway team had skilled coordination. The young players of Zhichao tried their best to fight. They had the skill of passing the ball as soon as they got it. The two wings flew together. When they reached the goal, they still lacked the skill of the final shot. The right wing still needed Qixiang's skillful footwork and ball control.疾走传中亦有佳作，江雷在供球在掠夺，俱见功夫。上半时，虽先失一球尚足能与铁路相持，惟在下半时，拼力逆风作战，浪费气力，本拟一鼓作气，再而三，三而竭，全军气力疲竭，远不逮上半时之速度与英勇；两震不能飞矣！内卫空防矣！力穷气馁矣！这种种因素足以致志超于败阵之地。

Good crossing also worked well. Jiang Lei showed his skills in supplying and snatching the ball. In the first half, although they lost a goal first, they were still able to hold their own against the Railway team. However, in the second half, they fought hard against the wind, wasting energy. They originally planned to do it in one go, but they tried again and again, and exhausted themselves on the third attempt. The entire army was exhausted, far less than the speed and bravery of the first half. They could not fly with both wings shaken! The inner defense was empty! Their strength was exhausted and they were discouraged! These factors were enough to lead Zhichao to defeat.

### World Coin King

— Jing Xin

The Yuan Datou, which has been absent for more than ten years, has reappeared this time, and we have to look at it with new eyes. Recently, the open-air silver dollar market has been crowded with people, and the situation is unprecedentedly grand. However, because rare things are expensive, the number of silver dollars hidden among the people is quite large after all, so it is not enough to make it a rare commodity. At present, the Yuan Datou is favored only because the Gold Yuan Coupons are not promising. The general silver dollar dealers can't be said to be arrogant. But there is a coin merchant in the United States named Meyer, who can indeed be regarded as the king of coin dealers in the world.

Meyer specializes in buying and selling rare coins. Many people collect and cherish these rare coins like collecting stamps and antiques. Meyer has been in this business for fifty years since he was sixteen. He often conducts transactions by correspondence, so his customers are located everywhere. He receives more than 200,000 letters every year. The most in one year - 1935 - he received 1.25 million letters discussing transactions. Therefore, Meyer does a lot of transactions, and the price can be sold to the highest point. In 1933, he made a transaction totaling 220,000 US dollars, which was the largest amount in coin sales, which was bought on behalf of the collector Walter Newcomb. He once sold an 1804 Dollar silver coin for a high price of 10,500 US dollars, setting the highest record for silver coin prices.

Meyer has vision and foresight in doing business. In 1935, he offered a high price of 75 yuan each to solicit the Liberty Head nickel coins issued in 1913. At the time, everyone laughed at him. But by last year, each Liberty Head nickel coin was worth 3,750 yuan. Originally, the government often had to melt down many coins that were no longer in circulation. Meyer paid attention to this type of news at any time to increase its value. Because he saw the file of the Treasury Department destroying the Liberty Head nickel coins, he collected them in advance. This is Meyer's most proud masterpiece.

When Meyer gets a coin, he traces its history to find out its origins, the year it was issued, the quantity minted, whether it has any special significance, who designed the pattern, who engraved the plate, which mint made it, and so on. For several extremely rare coins, he has to find out who has collected them. If you browse Meyer's collection of coins, there are detailed records next to each coin. This type of information is of great interest to collectors, and therefore attracts many customers.

In general, people think that the value of coins always increases the earlier they are. In fact, this is not necessarily the case. Meyer said: "The oldest coins that exist today are the coins from the era of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, but each

### Standard Russian Cuisine

— Eastern Jing

Moscow has no nightclubs. In fact, you won't find a single nightclub in the entire Soviet Union, because they believe that nightclubs are a prominent symbol of capitalism. But Moscow has many restaurants, large and small, many of which have bands and singers, where people can eat, drink, and make merry.

A typical Moscow restaurant is the Alavi Restaurant, named after the Alavi River in Georgia. It serves Georgian and Caucasian food, and the decor is also Georgian.

Besides band performances and singing, there are no other entertainment programs in the restaurant. There is a dance floor in the hall. The seats around are often full, and there are private rooms on the upper floor, the best of which faces the band. Many famous American visitors to the Soviet Union, such as Hopkins, Harriman, Willkie, Nelson, and Mrs. Roosevelt, have been guests here.

The standard Russian dishes at Alavi start with alcohol, vodka or Caucasian cognac, along with hot bread and cold dishes. Next is turkey. Then comes the main dish, lamb, for which Alavi's lamb is famous throughout Russia for its aroma. The last dish is fruit, and if you can still eat, there's also ice cream.

How much does such a meal cost? Including tips, about one hundred to one hundred and seventy-five rubles, depending on how much alcohol is consumed. This amount of rubles is equivalent to about eighteen to thirty-one dollars and fifty cents in US dollars.

According to official Soviet figures, the average monthly wage of a Soviet worker is about seven hundred rubles, so eating such a large Russian meal is not easy.

Worth only one US dollar. However, the three-dollar gold coins minted in the United States in 1870 are worth more than one thousand US dollars each on the market. During the war, a type of small Roman coin disappeared from both banks of the Chegoslav River, and the price rose to ten US dollars per coin. After the war, these small Roman coins reappeared, and the price also fell, and you could buy one for less than one US dollar."

Last year, the King of Egypt wanted to sell off some of his coin collection. Many coin dealers from New York, London, and Paris went to bid, but in the end, Meir was chosen. Undoubtedly, Meir can make a lot of money in this rare transaction, and he also received permission from the King of Egypt to publish the letter selecting him as an advertisement. This is truly a case of gaining both fame and fortune.

### Umbrella

— Zhang Hongxiang

The umbrella, commonly known as a Western umbrella, is now a very common rain gear item. However, when it first appeared, there was an interesting and moving story.

During the reign of Queen Victoria of England (19th century), it can be said that not a single gentleman walking on the street would not carry an umbrella. The novelist Stevenson once said, "Gentlemen never leave their umbrellas. In their hearts, they believe this is a symbol of decency." However, the word "umbrella" as an accessory had not yet been created in Shakespeare's time (16th century).

The traveler Joneas Highway was the pioneer of umbrella-carrying among English (men). Before him, no one dared to make such a bold move. When Joe walked down the street with an umbrella, the residents of London were greatly disgusted, saying that Highway had a woman's tone, and that people had no reason to avoid the rain given by God. They poured water on his head, threw rotten fruit at him, and followed him with ridicule. But Highway ignored everything, held up his giant umbrella, and said to himself, "In the near future, everyone will carry one." But this sentence did not come true. Thirty years later, umbrellas were not widely used. Only small restaurants and coffee shops had one or two, which were rented out to customers like cars. This is a very strange thing. Hundreds of years ago, the driest country knew how to use umbrellas before England. In places like Burma, umbrellas had become very common, but white umbrellas were reserved only for emperors and sacred white elephants. In ancient times, the East used umbrellas as symbols of royal power. From the carvings of Egypt and Sumer, it can be found that thousands of years ago, umbrellas were extremely famous.

Abraham Lincoln, the most famous and outstanding figure in the United States, always carried an umbrella made of cotton cloth whenever he went out on horseback.

### Excellent Credit Reputation

— Xi

The managers of two life insurance companies were boasting about the excellent credit and prompt compensation of their respective companies. A said, "Last time there was a plane crash, we received the news in the morning and immediately paid the insurance compensation in the afternoon."

"That's nothing," B replied. "Once, a person fell from a window on the thirty-sixth floor of a skyscraper, and fell to the window of our office on the twelfth floor. We handed him the check on the spot."

### Viewing the Present with the Past

— Wang Lintai

Reading modern history, we know that the peasants suffered the most during the Taiping Rebellion. From the end of the Daoguang reign to the 21st year of the Xianfeng reign, disasters occurred frequently, and taxes were unavoidable, and many additional taxes were levied. After the new grain was fixed, old taxes were also pursued, and the baojia and militia were charged fees and conscripts according to the amount of land. Those who had land could not sell it even at a reduced price, and even gifts were not accepted. Shen Shiguo, a poet in the fields, has a poem entitled "Ode to the Field": In the past, the field was enough to make the character "rich," but today the field is the head of the character "burden." Dragging down the legs makes the character "armor," and stretching out the head makes the character "not free." The field on the heart "thinks" is often bitter, and the field in the heart "worries" endlessly. At that time, I only hoped that the field would bring "blessing," but who knew that many fields would bring "piles" of sorrow!

Reading this poem today, I feel that the description is particularly vivid and meaningful. Since victory, farmers have been sitting in a city of sorrow amidst the chaos of war. Ordinary owner-farmers, in addition to paying taxes, also have "consolation money for strong men," "special self-defense donations," "reception fees for passing troops," "office expenses for township and bao offices," and "apportionment for autonomous construction," etc., in various forms and numerous categories, far more than in the past. Moreover, there are some corrupt officials who engage in fraud for personal gain, and new local bullies have cleverly established new names and levied taxes indiscriminately. The suffering of the common people is even worse than it was then, which is lamentable.

### Strange Habits

— Yang Zhen

Some people have special preferences for certain parts of food, such as the head of the bighead carp or the belly of the eel, but I have never heard of anyone who likes to eat duck tails. Recently, I read a Qing Dynasty note, which says: "Li Biao, also known as Qianwei, a xiucai from the South China Sea, had a habit of eating pickled duck tails, and every meal required them. If his family served a whole duck, he would cut off the tail and discard the rest. If relatives and friends held banquets, and he was not provided with duck tails, he would angrily leave, even if there were rare and precious dishes in front of him. There was a wealthy family in Foshan Town who held banquets frequently and cooked lavishly. They used dozens of pickled ducks every day, but they hated the smell of the tails and ordered their family to throw them over the wall before putting them in the pot. When Qing heard about this, he sighed and said, 'To entrust a bright pearl to dung, to reject a valuable jade to mud, the world has people who go against human nature, such as this vulgar father. The world does not love treasure, I cannot bear to discard it on the ground.' So, he moved to live next door to the wealthy family and enjoyed their pickled tails every day." Everyone has different habits of preferring crusts, and this is another example.

### Evolution of Esperanto

— Mao Yi

The differences in languages and writing systems among the world's ethnic groups are one of the main causes of emotional barriers among human beings. If there were a universal language, it would undoubtedly add a driving force to the "One World" movement. As early as the 17th and 18th centuries, great thinkers such as the French Descartes and the German Leibniz discussed this matter, but what was lacking was concrete expression.

Among the early world languages, there was "Volapük," invented by the German Schleyer in 1879. Within ten years of its release, 283 Volapük promotion associations were established around the world, and books in 25 languages were translated into this world language. Unfortunately, after two more years, Volapük went from prosperity to decline and gradually disappeared. At the same time, in 1887, the Russian Dr. Zamenhof also invented a world language called "Esperanto." After its release, all relevant groups unanimously considered it a major advance in world languages, and the great German philosopher Einstein and Krompeter supported it. It initially spread in Russia, but in 1895 its publication was sealed for printing an article by Tolstoy, and its dissemination was suppressed. However, it did not die out because of this, but crossed the borders of the Tsar and spread to Western Europe, especially in France, and later crossed the sea and spread to England.

In 1905, the first Esperanto conference was held in the suburbs of Paris, where Zamenhof's "Declaration" was delivered, stating the intention and purpose of Esperanto, and laying the foundation for the circulation of this world language for more than 60 years.

At the same time, other world languages have also been introduced one after another. The earliest and most influential of these was "Ido" (Ido), produced in 1907. It was adapted from Esperanto. In addition, there are several other, less well-known, versions.

In 1921 and 1922, the League of Nations tried to recommend Esperanto as the official world language, but it failed to pass because the French government opposed it on the grounds of school teaching issues. However, the spread of Esperanto did not decline because of this. On the contrary, in 1939, 42 radio stations broadcast in Esperanto; at the same time, more than 6,000 books and booklets were printed in Esperanto.

In 1924, the "International Auxiliary Language Association" was formally established, which was a major event in the history of Esperanto. Six years later, it organized a world language research association in Geneva, gathering famous linguists from various countries to review various different world languages, hoping to unify them and avoid them diverging like natural languages. Otherwise, not only would scholars be at a loss, but it would also lose the meaning of a world language. Unfortunately, after a long period of discussion, this meeting contributed little to the practical solution of the problem. The experts present generally tended to engage in empty linguistic debates, and failed to focus on how to solve the practical problems of world languages.

On the bad side, language unification is a cruel means of assimilation by aggressors. However, the Esperanto movement, launched by the people in the last century, is purely motivated. Esperanto's history of more than sixty years shows an extremely valuable example and also makes a major contribution to promoting international understanding.
