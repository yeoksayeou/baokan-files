### Li, Acting President, Returns Triumphantly to His Hometown; Guilin Welcomes Him with Flags and Cannon Salvos; Scheduled to Fly to Changsha Today to Invite Cheng Qian to the Capital

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 22nd] Acting President Li was originally scheduled to fly to Guilin at 9:00 AM on the 22nd. However, due to important official duties, the departure was delayed until 12:00 PM. Those who came to the airport to see him off included Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Wu Shangying, Yu Hanmou, Xue Yue, Ouyang Ju, Zhang Fakui, and over a hundred others. The acting president traveled on the "Zi Qiang" (Self-Strengthening) aircraft, a twin-engine plane, as the Guilin airport's facilities were inadequate for the larger four-engine "Zhongmei" (Sino-American) aircraft. At precisely 12:00 PM, the acting president, accompanied by President Sun and others, entered the aircraft cabin. Everyone's faces were filled with joy, a stark contrast to the solemn and silent mood when the acting president arrived. The acting president was immediately surrounded by reporters, who eagerly inquired about peace and new economic plans. The acting president replied with a smile, repeatedly saying "No decision yet." After shaking hands with those seeing him off, President Sun personally escorted him to the aircraft door, and Chairman Xue helped him board. The plane took off at 12:10 PM. According to an aide speaking to reporters, the acting president is scheduled to fly to Changsha on the 23rd. If Bai Chongxi has already returned to Hankou, the acting president may fly to Hankou. Otherwise, he will return to the capital from Changsha.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd] At 8:00 AM on the 22nd, Acting President Li invited all the executive members of the National Assembly Guangdong-Guangzhou Representatives Association for a discussion at the Commandant's Headquarters. Those present included Xiang Hanping, Luo Yiqun, Deng Longguang, Lu Yougang, Xiao Ciyin, Huang Fanyi, and over ten others. They had a pleasant conversation until 9:20 AM before departing. They exchanged views on current national affairs, focusing on promoting peace, reforming politics, and stabilizing the economy. At 12:13 PM, Acting President Li departed from Guangzhou on a special "Zi Qiang" aircraft to fly to Guilin. Before his departure, reporters inquired about the contents of the new economic policy and the resumption of the Legislative Yuan, but Mr. Li avoided answering.

[Our Guilin Dispatch, 22nd] Acting President Li returned to Guilin by special plane at 2:00 PM on the 22nd. Mrs. Li and Chairman Huang led a welcoming party at the airport. The acting president rode in an open-top sedan into the city. Every household hung flags and fired cannons. The public's enthusiasm was high, and the streets were packed with people eager to catch a glimpse of his demeanor. As the motorcade passed through the streets, the applause was thunderous. The acting president raised his hat in the car, responding with joyful smiles.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 22nd] Today, the entire city of 300,000 people welcomed Acting President Li, who had been away from his hometown for a long time, with unprecedented enthusiasm. National flags were hung throughout the city, and colorful arches were erected. Over 2,000 representatives from all walks of life, including National Assembly representatives residing in Guilin, legislative and supervisory committee members, and representatives from the provincial government and below, led by Chairman Huang, went to the airport to await his arrival. At 2:30 PM, the "Zi Qiang" aircraft flew into the sky and landed safely. Military music was played in unison, and the representatives applauded to pay their respects. Mrs. Li and her son stepped forward to greet him first. Acting President Li nodded with a smile and shook hands with the welcoming personnel in order. He then entered the city by car. As he entered the city, a 21-gun salute was fired, and the people cheered along the road. Shops set off firecrackers. The acting president took off his hat along the way to express his thanks. He then drove straight to the provincial government building to rest. From 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, he separately met with National Assembly representatives, legislative and supervisory committee members, heads of provincial and municipal governments, heads of central government agencies stationed in Guilin, and journalists residing in Guilin. At 5:00 PM, all sectors held a public banquet at the provincial government, and at 7:00 PM, a variety show was held in the evening.

[Our Guilin Dispatch, 22nd] At 6:00 PM, all sectors held a banquet for Acting President Li at the provincial government. In the evening, a Guilin opera was performed in the auditorium to entertain the acting president and his wife.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 22nd] When Acting President Li met with leaders from all sectors on the afternoon of the 22nd, he first expressed his gratitude for the warm welcome from all sectors. He then explained the relocation of some central government personnel to Guangzhou to conduct meetings, saying that all kinds of rumors circulating outside were groundless. Finally, he inquired whether all sectors had any difficulties and could express them to him face to face at any time.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 22nd] It is widely rumored here that Acting President Li could fly to Hankou from Guilin on the 22nd. Mayor Yan immediately ordered the entire city to hang flags to welcome him, but as of noon, the acting president had not yet arrived.

### President Sun is Scheduled to Return to the Capital Tomorrow; Acting President's Exercise of Authority Shows Progress

[United Press, Guangzhou, 22nd] Since coming to Guangzhou to carry out the "unity mission," Acting President Li has made some progress in exercising his authority as acting president. People who have participated in a series of meetings with Acting President Li now unanimously believe that Acting President Li's skillful handling of the situation is worthy of praise and has won the support of all parties, including many who previously held hostile attitudes. President Sun and Vice President Wu are now scheduled to return to the capital on the 24th, trying to reverse their previous grand ambition of organizing separate units in South China. Their departure and stay are obviously no longer essential. However, if they continue to serve, it will give the government a united image in future peace talks.

Acting President Li's firm belief that peace is possible and his announcement of his will to reform politics have strengthened Acting President Li's position. According to participants in the talks, the acting president initially encountered significant difficulties, but his willingness to stay in Guangzhou until some solutions were reached finally softened the other party. The final decision on whether Sun Ke will resign now depends on the Legislative Yuan's resumption of meetings in the capital. It is rumored that many legislators are dissatisfied with President Sun and may force him to step down.

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 22nd] Acting President Li's trip has achieved a unanimous understanding of the government's internal unity. President Sun will fly to the capital on the 24th. Vice President Wu Tiecheng did not leave Guangzhou on the 22nd because he still needs to attend the political affairs meeting on the 23rd and may travel with President Sun.

### New Economic Plan to be Announced Soon; Submitted for Discussion at Today's Political Affairs Meeting; Success or Failure Hinges on Currency Contraction

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 22nd] Today, the 22nd, Acting President Li convened a meeting at the official residence on the new financial and economic reform plan. Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Xu Kan, Liu Gongyun, Xi Demao, Ding Shiqi, and others participated. It is heard that the final decision has been made and can be announced and implemented after being discussed and approved by the Executive Yuan meeting tomorrow, the 23rd. According to related sources, the content of the plan will include: (1) Opening a free market for gold and foreign exchange, (2) Completely releasing the gold and silver stored by the Central Bank to stabilize prices, (3) Allowing the free circulation of silver dollars, and (4) Issuing US dollar bonds.

[Our Dispatch] On the eve of the announcement of the new economic plan, there are many speculations from all parties. The center of the discussion is the ratio between silver dollars and gold yuan coupons, as well as the ratio between gold and silver dollars. It is learned that Finance Minister Xu also had multiple discussions with Liu Gongyun and senior Central Bank officials in Shanghai. At that time, it was originally intended to use the five-cent silver auxiliary coins at the time of the currency change as the silver dollar for listing prices. However, after final consideration, the silver content of the five-cent silver coins is inherently low, with each coin containing only 0.18 taels of pure silver. If it is priced at half a yuan, the silver dollars currently circulating in the market will inevitably rise sharply, further affecting overall prices. Therefore, the final decision was made to recast the "ship ocean" [referring to the silver dollar with Sun Yat-sen's image] and use it as the silver dollar for listing prices. As for the listed price, because it is of great importance, it still needs to be carefully studied and decided at the Guangzhou political affairs meeting. The method of issuing silver dollars in the future is also worth serious consideration to avoid similar runs on banks due to fluctuations in the black market. The Central Mint has generally prepared the machinery and materials and can start casting within a week of receiving the order. However, the external rumor that 500,000 coins will be cast daily cannot be met with the existing machinery. The Issuing Bureau stated that the National Bank has a large number of silver dollars in storage. After the new plan is implemented, the stored silver dollars will be released first, and then the "ship ocean" will be rushed to meet the market demand. The outside world believes that the key to the success or failure of the new plan lies in whether the gold yuan coupons can avoid continued expansion. If the issuance can be tightened, prices may stabilize. Otherwise, the listed price of silver dollars will inevitably be divorced from the black market, and each price increase will become an indicator of the rising trend. Silver dollars will repeatedly become collectible financial commodities, and the value of gold yuan coupons, which depreciates daily, will still circulate in the market. (Please see page 4)

[United Press, Guangzhou, 22nd] It is learned that the Executive Yuan discussed issues such as the ratio of gold yuan coupons to silver coins at an informal meeting this morning. The new economic plan may be announced on the 23rd.

If left to his own devices, Mao Zedong may become the master of all of China. His communism is different from the Soviet form. Unless the Soviet Union maintains a superior influence in China, Mao Zedong, who rules over 400 million people, may follow in Tito's footsteps. Stalin must use the situation in China to pressure Britain and the US to make political and economic concessions before this happens."

Editorial

### US Policy Towards Japan Will Not Change

Just as the U.S. Department of the Army is re-examining its policy towards Japan, Under Secretary of the Army Draper suddenly submitted his resignation to President Truman, which was immediately approved, with his resignation taking effect on the 28th of this month. When the news arrived, the Japanese were extremely uneasy, believing that Draper's departure from Washington might affect the U.S. policy of supporting Japan, so the Japanese expressed pessimistic feelings in the midst of extreme shock. Chinese people also harbor a kind of suspicion regarding the personnel changes in the U.S. Department of the Army, believing that the U.S. plan for the reconstruction of Japan will change from now on. In fact, this series of speculations are all wrong and superficial views. The psychology of the Japanese is based on fear of gain and loss, so they are prone to joy and anger. Most Chinese people do not understand the U.S. policy towards Japan, so they think that the U.S. policy towards Japan may have changed with Draper's departure. In order to clarify these various erroneous views, we will analyze the reasons for Draper's departure from Washington and the unchanging nature of Washington's policy towards Japan, based on what we know, as follows:

1.  Draper's resignation is a fact that the Republican Party has lost ground in the Department of the Army. During the era of the late President Roosevelt, the personnel of the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and staff agencies were in an era of cooperation between the Democratic and Republican parties. After Vice President Truman succeeded the presidency, he still followed this system unchanged. This time, the Democrat Truman was successfully elected, the Secretary of State has been replaced, and the head of strategic decision-making has been transferred to Marshal Eisenhower. Truman's administration is moving towards the road of striving for good governance, consolidating the army, and personnel is completely dominated by Democrats. Therefore, it is natural for Draper, who represents the Republican Party in the military, to withdraw from the Department of the Army.

2.  Draper's departure from the Department of the Army seems to have left General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan, without an assistant, and Marshal MacArthur's prestige in controlling Japan may be somewhat affected in terms of personnel, but there is no impact in terms of policy. Marshal MacArthur is also a Republican, and the relationship between MacArthur and Wall Street, and the relationship between the Japanese financial and business circles and Wall Street, with Draper as the link. Since Draper took office as Under Secretary in October 1947, he has made many plans for the occupation policies of Japan and Germany. The Department of the Army completely based its policies on the opinions of MacArthur regarding the control of Japan. Someone asked the Department of the Army: "Where is the final decision on your occupation policy towards Japan?" The joking answer was: "The decision is in Tokyo," referring to the Allied Headquarters presided over by MacArthur. A month ago, Under Secretary Royal, along with Wedemeyer, visited Japan. The main purpose was to discuss the Japanese issue with MacArthur and others, and the second was to reconcile the personnel differences between the Department of the Army and the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo. Royal's words and deeds after returning to Washington seemed to be unfavorable to MacArthur, so Draper's separation from Royal is also a natural personnel matter, and there is no reason to explain it as a change in the U.S. policy towards Japan.

3.  U.S. public opinion does not welcome Draper, and there has been much criticism of Draper's reports over the years. Therefore, Draper's loss of power this time can be said to be a preliminary victory for the anti-Japan support public opinion, but it does not completely shift the U.S. policy towards Japan. During Draper's tenure as Under Secretary, he led a large-scale investigation team to visit Japan and South Korea last year, and the world-shaking "Draper Report," which opposed Japanese reparations, advocated establishing a high industrial level in Japan, completing Japan's economic recovery, and then controlling the East Asian market, was written by Draper. Since the publication of this report, it has generally aroused opposition from countries around the world, and the reaction from China, both in the government and among the people, has been significant. Washington initially planned to submit the "Draper Report" to the Far Eastern Commission as the specific opinion of the United States on its policy towards Japan, but due to the lack of focus of domestic and foreign reactions, the State Department also expressed a cautious proposal, and the report was temporarily put on hold. However, Washington and the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo have been following this direction in their policy towards Japan over the years. In particular, some of MacArthur's orders that contradicted the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission completely coincided with the "Draper Report's" advocacy. Therefore, in terms of form, the "Draper Report" has not been formally proposed to form a bill, but in reality, Marshal MacArthur has long become a faithful executor of the report. Over the years, due to the criticism of the report by American public opinion, and the failure of MacArthur's control of Japan, coupled with various internal factors of the Republican Party's loss of power in politics, it can be seen that Draper's quiet departure from Washington is entirely the inevitable result of the reduction in the prestige of Draper and the people behind him, but it is not a fundamental shift in Washington's policy of supporting Japan. Looking at the situation, the overall review of the U.S. policy of supporting Japan in the future will be mainly based on Eisenhower and Royal, but whether they will change the fundamental principles is not easy to predict at this time.

Based on the above, we can believe that the U.S. policy towards Japan will not necessarily change fundamentally. If there is a real change, the occurrence of the following two things can be interpreted as a change in the policy towards Japan: (1) Completely changing the policy of unilateral control of Japan; (2) Convening a peace conference with Japan, maintaining the veto power of the four countries. However, there are not only no signs of the realization of these two things at present, but also will not be. Therefore, one should not have illusions about Draper's resignation, and there is no need to doubt that the U.S. plan for the reconstruction of Japan will change.

### US Consuls and Staff in Communist-Controlled Areas Have Been Out of Contact for Several Weeks, Beiping Consulate Can Still Communicate with Washington

[United Press, Washington, 21st] The State Department announced that more than 20 U.S. consuls and staff in Communist-controlled areas have been out of contact for several weeks, but so far, there have been no reports of abuse. Thirteen people, including U.S. Consul Ward in Pan Yang, have been out of contact since November 18th of last year. Ten people, including U.S. Consul Smith in Tianjin, have also lost contact with the outside world for a week. The U.S. consulates in these two places have always had their own radio stations, which were allowed to be used for several days after the Communist army occupied them, but were subsequently closed. The State Department is now trying to restore communication with them. At the same time, the U.S. consulate in Beiping has been able to communicate with Washington. In addition to Consul Clubb, there are a total of 46 staff members in the consulate, as well as students from Chinese language schools and many American expatriates.

[United Press, Nanjing, 22nd] Some diplomatic figures here pointed out on the 22nd that the refusal of the Communist authorities in Tianjin and Shenyang to issue licenses allowing the U.S. consulates to send and receive radio telegrams is a manifestation of the Communist Party's tough attitude.

According to fragmentary and reliable talks from visitors to Pan Yang, although the Communists have occupied Pan Yang for more than four months, they still disregard the foreign consulates, and the consulate officials have not been able to make any contact with the Communist authorities. They said that the staff of the U.S. consulate are confined to their residences and are effectively isolated from the outside world, but the staff of the British and French consulates enjoy greater freedom of movement. Although the consulate staff in Tianjin enjoy freedom of movement, they are ignored in the same way as in Pan Yang. Some people believe that it is too early to say that the Communist Party's attitude of non-interaction with the consulates in Tianjin represents a definite trend. They pointed out that the Communists have only occupied Tianjin for a month, so they may not have had time to establish appropriate official institutions to deal with matters related to foreign consulates. They said that the attitude of the Communist Party in the Northeast and Shenyang cannot be equated with the attitude in North China.

### Change of Zhejiang Province Chairman: From Chen Yi to Zhou Yan; Our Special Correspondent Chu Xuanchuan Yusheng

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 20th] I still remember when Shen Chengzhang, the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, was approved to resign in July of the 37th year of the Republic, and Chen Gongqia was appointed to succeed him. At that time, this reporter wrote a report on the gains and losses of Shen's governance of Zhejiang, and placed unlimited expectations on Chen's governance of Zhejiang. Over the years, Chen governed Zhejiang for more than seven months, and the central government once again heard of his dismissal. He was succeeded by Zhou Fengzhang, who had experienced hundreds of battles. This reporter, at the urging of various parties, once again wrote to record the gains and losses of Chen's governance of Zhejiang and Zhou's future approach to governing Zhejiang.

Chen Yi's Beginning of Governing Zhejiang

He once told reporters that he would "especially focus on security and production." In these two areas, he seemed particularly interested in the latter. He said: "The Jiekou Hydropower Station must be promoted to success, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway should extend from Jinhua to Wenzhou, and the Qiantang River should be officially opened to navigation, then the economic situation will definitely improve. Today, when we talk about security, if we only use military force to win, it is passive. We should develop economic undertakings to enrich the people's livelihood, so that everyone has food to eat and clothes to wear. This is considered active security work." During his tenure, Chen recruited experts and scholars and his subordinates to formulate a ten-year plan. To this day, we can boldly say that Chen's direction was not wrong. He believed that "stability begins with people's livelihood" is a fundamental solution, just as he resolutely implemented land reform, regardless of whether his land reform was thorough or met the needs of the people. But we believe he had the courage to propose it, and he was right. For example, the peasant schools he organized started with improving land, putting increased production to the highest degree, and improving farmers' lives. We also don't care about the scope of his funds, whether he can achieve his goals, but he

Had the Courage to Do So

It's already commendable. We should remember that Chen is 67 years old. At his age, and in his several conversations with reporters, it was felt that his thinking really surpassed that of the average young person in their twenties. He is a believer in the Three Principles of the People. He believes that the Principle of People's Livelihood must be solved first. He believes that socialism is the newest doctrine (the Three Principles of the People are also socialism). He opposes using violence to subdue society. He loves peace, he hopes the world will never have war, and that everyone can engage in theoretical struggles to work together for the construction of a new society, a new China, and a new world.

This reporter has come into contact with many provincial chairmen, and it seems difficult to find many with Chen's thinking. We can say that Chen believes that if politics are done well, everything can be solved easily, but the prerequisite for politics is thought. He believes that thought should be free, and violence should be opposed. I remember that in a frank conversation with me before Chen was dismissed, he once said: "Correct thoughts can eliminate distorted thoughts."

This reporter believes that Chen's major premise for governing Zhejiang and all his facilities are generally correct. However, during Chen's tenure,

Personnel Changes Were Frequent

Especially the changes in county magistrates were the most frequent. Many were changed not once in three months, or once in two months. We feel that many things can be effective in two or three months, let alone the county magistrate with complex issues. We always hope that any county magistrate will be good for the local area. If there is to be good, it cannot be effective in two or three months, so we feel that Chen's changes to the county magistrates were too easy, and it seems that there was not enough testing of the abilities of the county magistrates. Furthermore, Chen's thinking is innovative, his views are insightful, and he is not easily convinced by other opposing opinions, which is also a regret, because although people's opinions are different, there must be some part of the reason for what people are talking about, which may not be used as a reference.

Now, Chen is gone, and we really feel reluctant. Because Chen's departure is not because of the excessive number of county magistrates changed or the lack of consideration of general people's comments. Chen's departure is a decision of the Executive Yuan, the meaning of the central government. His successor, Zhou Fengzhang, is a Chinese

Traditional Model Soldier. When the reporter met him, he particularly emphasized the importance of security. Indeed, the security situation in Zhejiang today has reached a serious edge. With Zhou's battle-tested background, governing this slightly uneasy area should not be a problem. However, we recall Mr. Sun Yat-sen's words, "The top priority of construction is the people's livelihood," so in addition to security, we should also consider the construction of people's livelihood. In my conversation with Zhou, I deeply felt that Zhou is a straightforward and decisive person. Zhou repeatedly claimed that he felt the burden of combining military and political power in one body. We believe that the central government's intention is that if Zhou only has military power, he may not be able to achieve his ideals, so he is given political power again, so that the military and politics are united, which is beneficial for command. We hope that in addition to his busy military affairs, Zhou will weigh the gains and losses of previous rulers of Zhejiang and further improve the political efficiency of Zhejiang Province.

### US Government Authorities Begin Considering New Military Aid Plan; Western Europe Needs About One Billion; Whether China Can Receive Aid Depends on the Situation

[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] It has been learned that the government has tentatively decided to request Congress to allocate a "blank check" of $1.2 billion to $2 billion for military aid, including armaments, to "free" countries around the world. Among the "free" countries, China and South Korea may be included. A single military aid bill to Congress to support the North Atlantic Security Pact is about to be drafted by a special committee headed by Assistant Secretary of State Gross. President Truman may request approximately $1 billion in military aid to countries of the Atlantic Pact, and $200 million to $1 billion in military aid to Greece, Turkey, Korea, and Latin America, and China may also be included. There is now a strong sentiment among government officials to request Congress to authorize the President to decide on the amount of military aid to be allocated based on the overall world situation assessed by American strategists. This will enable the government to provide new military aid to China if the situation in China permits such aid. According to the opinions of some officials within the government, if military aid is to be accelerated, it will have to be drawn from the current ordnance supplies of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, because the surplus materials from World War II are now almost exhausted, and most of the military aid materials will have to be allocated from existing stocks that can be saved by the military departments. Therefore, the initial cash expenditure will be the cost of packaging and transporting ordnance, because shipping new ordnance overseas will take a longer time. Government officials emphasized that, at present, the amount of military aid to each country has not yet been allocated. This measure is in line with the "blank check" principle of maintaining the "fluidity" of the military aid plan. However, the amount of the military aid plan for countries of the North Atlantic Pact to be submitted to Congress has been largely determined to be approximately $1 billion. Officials said that the issue of military aid to Greece, Turkey, Korea, and Latin America is still less decisive, and the overall estimate of the total amount of military aid to free countries of the world outside the North Atlantic Pact is between approximately $200 million and $1 billion. The government hopes to submit the North Atlantic Pact to Congress at the end of March or early April. Officials believe that the ordnance bill can be expected to follow closely, and they pointed out that the relationship between the two bills is equivalent to "vehicles and trailers."

### Seven Countries Will Meet Again to Draft Final Draft of Atlantic Alliance; US Willing to Guarantee Joint Resistance to Aggression

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st] Secretary of State Acheson will meet with the ambassadors of the six countries of Britain, France, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg tomorrow and the day after tomorrow to discuss the Atlantic Pact. It is generally believed that Acheson and the ambassadors of the six countries have gained strength because of the support of American public opinion and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and now they can draft the final draft of the pact more freely. The United States will, within the scope of its constitution, agree to provide assistance when a signatory country is attacked. The consensus is that the seven countries will agree that an attack on one signatory country is an attack on all signatory countries. As for whether to adopt a military plan, it will be up to the relevant countries to decide.

[United Press, Washington, 21st] Senior officials declared today that the United States will guarantee in the North Atlantic Treaty of Collective Defense that the United States will not stand idly by if any signatory country is attacked. Although the final wording is still to be drafted, one of the clauses will stipulate the United States' determination to resist aggression, which is beyond doubt. At the same time, State Department officials declared that Acheson and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have reached a consensus on the nature of this guarantee, and are now scheduled to meet with the ambassadors of Canada and five Western European countries in the next day or two to hold a final round of negotiations. The State Department hopes to submit the draft of the treaty and the plan for military aid to Western Europe to Congress within a month. The military aid plan must be approved by both houses of Congress before it can be implemented. It will generally stipulate the supply of military equipment worth more than $3 billion to Western Europe, including existing surplus materials of the US military, with more than $1 billion to be supplied in the first year. It has not yet been decided who will be responsible for handling the plan. It is rumored that the US government will appoint a supreme commander to preside over the matter, but some officials believe that this move may harm the confidence of Western European countries.

### Atlantic Defense Agreement Does Not Violate Anglo-Soviet Treaty

McNeil Answers Questions from Left-Wing Members of Parliament

[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st] British Minister of State McNeil declared in the House of Commons today in response to inquiries from Communist MP Baradin and far-left Labor MP Walberg that the British government will do its best to ensure that the provisions of the Atlantic Pact are in line with the general purposes of the United Nations Charter. McNeil continued, "I can assure Parliament that the British government has no intention of aggression. A defensive agreement that is in line with the principles of the United Nations Charter will not be far from violating the Anglo-Soviet Treaty." Walberg asked the government to guarantee that it would never agree to clauses that require Britain to automatically enter the war or engage in military action, and that other countries have not accepted the above provisions. McNeil replied that no government participating in the discussion of the pact has undertaken military obligations. Walberg can be assured that the government will keep his views in mind.

### Hoover Commission Blames US Intelligence Agency for Incompetence

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] The Hoover Commission said on the 21st that the State Department Intelligence Bureau is the "most incompetent and least efficient department" in the department. The Bureau apparently "places too much emphasis on pure research, and research is of no use within the State Department." The Commission also said that the relationship between the Bureau and the Central Intelligence Agency is "competition rather than cooperation." The above assessment is contained in the "Diplomacy" report, which the Hoover Commission recommended to Congress for the reorganization of the State Department. The Council recommended the appointment of a Special Assistant Secretary of State responsible for intelligence activities, who will be responsible for supervising research and intelligence work within the State Department, "guiding" smaller intelligence agencies overseas, and maintaining liaison with the Central Intelligence Agency. He also works closely with the "Planning Advisor" (a new position in the proposed State Department) to determine the effectiveness of actions taken in foreign policy. The Commission said, "The misconceptions of the Intelligence Bureau must be eliminated," and the person in charge "should train some people with excellent analytical and judgment abilities to be responsible, so that they can review all intelligence within the Bureau."

### Bolivian Cabinet Resigns En Masse

### Advocates for US-Soviet Understanding at Meeting of Soviet Jews

[Agence France-Presse, Newark, New Jersey, 21st] US Progressive Party leader Henry Wallace gave a speech to the Committee of Soviet Jews in this city on the 21st, saying that Israelis can benefit Arabs by using modern agricultural methods, just as the Jewish Autonomous Region in the Soviet Far East can benefit the Chinese in Northeast China by using the same methods. The purpose of the Committee of Soviet Jews in the United States includes raising funds and transferring agricultural equipment to the Jewish residents of the Jewish Autonomous Region in the Soviet Union. Wallace also believed that Jews in Israel and in the Jewish Autonomous Region in the Far East can serve as liaison between the British, American, and Slavic nations. He also said that US-Soviet understanding is still an urgent problem to be solved.

### Washington's Birthday: United Nations Takes a Day Off

[United Press, Lake Success, 22nd] The United Nations is closed today in commemoration of the birthday of the Founding Father of the United States, George Washington. The Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, and the Trusteeship Council have not met.

### Allied Headquarters Changes Policy Toward Japan: Tightens Aid to Promote Japan's Economic Recovery; US Authorities Are Drafting Concrete Plans

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] Following the resignation of US Undersecretary of the Army Draper, MacArthur Headquarters' policy toward Japan has also begun to change. MacArthur Headquarters announced that the previous policy of material assistance to Japan by the US occupying forces will be changed from generous to tight.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] An authoritative source recently told a Central News Agency reporter that the issue of Japan's democratization, which the Allied countries can guarantee will be completed in the occupation policy, has now been relegated to a secondary position. Whether Japan will become a democratic country is no longer the main concern of the occupying authorities. Their sincerity in promoting social reform in Japan will also gradually weaken. The only important occupation policy at present is to assist Japan's economic recovery so that Japan is no longer a burden on American taxpayers. The US policy in Japan is divided into three stages: (1) Japan's demilitarization; (2) Japan's democratization; (3) Economic recovery. Japan's demilitarization is almost complete, but the psychological disarmament of Japan cannot be measured to what extent it has been completed.

[United Press, Washington, 21st] Authoritative sources said today that senior US authorities are actively drafting plans to determine the final policy on Japan's reparations and the limits of Japan's industry, but no resolution has yet been reached, so it will not be announced for the time being. At the same time, the Far Eastern Commission hopes that the United States will submit the plan to the Council and not directly instruct MacArthur. Collective action is better than individual action on such issues.

### MacArthur and Royal: Female Writer Smedley Reveals

[United Press, New York, 21st] The Far East spy report of MacArthur Headquarters involved female writer Agnes Smedley. Smedley threatened to sue MacArthur for defamation, and said: "MacArthur and Secretary of the Army Royal disagreed on the entire policy toward Japan, resulting in a secret struggle that caused me to suffer."

### Ashida and Inukai: Singing a Double Act

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] The Ashida faction of the Japanese Democratic Party held a joint meeting of the final committee and the general affairs meeting on the 21st. During the meeting, Tokutaro Kitamura said: "Our position is very pure. The Inukai faction is starting from impure motives and is now shouting that the party convention is invalid, while we will reconfirm our path in the party convention." On the other hand, the Inukai faction also convened a general affairs meeting on the same day. Secretary-General Yasuri explained that he did not recognize the party convention convened by the Ashida faction, saying: "Since the establishment of the Yoshida Cabinet, the Democratic Party has invited the opposition between the cabinet and the opposition. In fact, there is no ideological difference between the two factions, only differences of opinion on the timing of joining the government. The crisis that is now causing the split is due to a conspiracy to exclude the new President Inukai. The party convention to be convened by the Ruan faction should be considered invalid. Only President Inukai, who was unanimously elected at last year's party convention, has the authority to convene a party convention. It is very clear."

### Philippine Senate Split: Speaker's Reinstatement Hopeless

President Quirino Supports the Decision

[United Press, Manila, 22nd] The Philippine Senate split yesterday, senators used force, and Speaker Averino led ten Liberal Party senators to walk out. A minority of twelve Liberal Party senators met separately, unanimously voted to remove Speaker Azarino, elected Guen Gu as Speaker, and decided to investigate Azarino's fraudulent acts. President Quirino has recognized this move as legal. Azarino refused to give in. The senators who supported Azarino jointly announced last night that they would no longer attend Senate meetings pending Azarino's reinstatement, but the anti-Azarino faction and the pro-Azarino faction have become a ratio of twelve to eleven. Azarino is afraid that there is no hope of reinstatement. This stalemate will probably be decided by the Supreme Court. The background of the Senate split is Averino's and Quirino's competition for control of the Liberal Party in order to obtain the party's presidential candidate qualification.

### US Democratic Party Lacks Leadership: Fails to Control New Congress; Various Legislations Encounter Resistance

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] The new Democratic Congress began its eighth week on the 21st, and President Truman's legislative proposals have fallen into a political quagmire. Except for the Reciprocal Trade Act, which has passed the House of Representatives, the main items on the legislative agenda have not been enacted. On major issues such as the abolition of the Taft-Hartley Labor Act, new taxes, and higher minimum wages, Truman must accept compromises, even though he is unwilling. The opportunity for Congress to vote to give Truman the power to control wages and prices is dimming. The government's plan to support agricultural prices is still under study and has not been submitted to Congress. After careful explanation, Truman's medical insurance plan has been met with increasing opposition. Various large organizations that helped the Democratic Party win the election last year have begun to complain about the lack of leadership in the Senate. There have also been attacks on Truman himself from the left. The New Republic magazine said that if Truman fails to stimulate Congress to take action to achieve the goals of the Democratic Party, he will evade his responsibility as the leader of the United States.

### US Has 600 Atomic Bombs: Rumor of One Missing; Spy Intelligence Unreliable

[Associated Press, Munich, 21st] During the trial of five spies on the 21st, a document stated that the United States has a total of 600 atomic bombs, and one has been lost in the United States. German police officer Storm said that he found the document in 25 documents found in a woman's handbag carried by a Polish refugee, Starozai. Starozai and four other Germans are currently accused of espionage in the US-occupied zone of Germany. During the interrogation, the five people all claimed to be innocent. US officials said that much of the "intelligence" carried by the five accused was false.

### Soviet Proposal by Trust Territory Governor: Security Council Puts Aside

Pacific Trust Islands to be Discussed Next Week

[United Press, Lake Success, 22nd] The United Nations Security Council's rotating chairman for February, Chinese representative Jiang Tingzhen, yesterday shelved the Soviet proposal to appoint Faruki Ge, the former Swedish ambassador to the Soviet Union, as the governor of the Trust Territory. It is said that it would be useless to put it to a vote, and I do not intend to schedule another date to discuss the case this month. The Security Council is now scheduled to meet on the 28th to discuss the issue of the US trusteeship of the Pacific Islands.

### The UN Requests Soviet Assistance to Complete the Reunification of North and South Korea so that the Korean Committee Can Contact the North Korean Regime

[United Press International, Lake Success, 21st] It was revealed on the 21st that the United Nations has requested Soviet assistance to facilitate contact between the North Korean government, supported by the Soviet Union, and the United Nations, to achieve the unification of all of Korea. UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie has delivered to Soviet representative Malik the notification to the chairman of the Korean Committee, Australian representative Hodgson, currently in Seoul. This Korean Committee was established last December to "assist in mediating the achievement of Korean unification and complete independence." Hodgson reported on February 9 that the committee had formed a subcommittee to "immediately contact North Korea, so that the committee's personnel can visit North Korea to find ways to eliminate obstacles between North and South Korea. The subcommittee is using various methods to contact North Korean leaders, one of which is to request the Soviet government to mediate to achieve the purpose of contacting North Korea."

### Greek Foreign Minister Suggests to Britain the Conclusion of a Mediterranean Alliance, Including Spain and Middle Eastern Countries

[United Press International, London, 22nd] It was learned on the 22nd that Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris has proposed a defense alliance to connect Spain with Western democracies. Tsaldaris had a two-hour secret talk with Foreign Secretary Bevin on the 21st and presented his proposal. It is said that Tsaldaris put forward two points: (1) Concluding a treaty of North Mediterranean countries, including France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Spain. Britain, due to its strategic position in the region, is also included. (2) A treaty of Eastern Mediterranean countries, including Israel, Arab countries, Turkey, and Britain. Iran and Pakistan may also be included.

### The Issue of Expanding the National Police Force will be Discussed by the Japanese Diet. It is Said that the Tokyo Police Department is Preparing to Equip Armored Vehicles

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] The issue of strengthening the Japanese police force, the necessity of which was stated by Prime Minister Yoshida at the time of his second cabinet formation, has gradually become a problem with the possibility of being realized. It is feared that this issue will also be formally discussed in the current Diet session. The focus of this issue lies in: regarding increasing personnel, there are two opinions: one advocating increasing the current fixed number of 125,000 personnel to 150,000, and the other suggesting establishing 150,000 police units separately.

[United Press International, Tokyo, 22nd] According to a Japanese newspaper report on the 22nd, the police force in the Tokyo area will be greatly increased. Each of the 73 police stations scattered in the Tokyo area will be equipped with ten armored vehicles and one jeep. The plan also advocates dividing Tokyo into five "defense" zones, in each of which a fully equipped motorized police unit will be prepared to deal with "any emergency," including mob riots and any Communist-incited disturbances. Due to the Washington's Birthday holiday, reporters could not immediately confirm or deny this news from the responsible officials of the Allied General Headquarters. In any case, any Japanese plans of this nature must be submitted to the Allied General Headquarters for review and final approval.

### If the Communists Control Japan, the Soviets Will Sweep Across the Pacific

Acheson Expresses Views to Reporters

[United Press International, Washington, 21st] Former Commander of the U.S. Occupation Army Eighth Army in Japan, Lieutenant General Eichelberger, said on the 21st: If the Communists control Japan, the Soviet-led Japanese army may sweep across the Pacific in a few years. Eichelberger said in an interview with United Press International reporters: "Regardless of how others see the strategic value of Japan, the Communists fully understand this, and they will pay any price to occupy Japan." Eichelberger, recalling that Japan once "knocked on Australia's door" in 1942, said: "If the Communists once control Japan, then this is very likely to be re-enacted in a few years." He continued: In his personal opinion, a Communist-controlled Japan will not be an "immediate" military threat because the Soviet navy is weak and has no amphibious warfare experience, but if the Soviet Union can coordinate the raw materials of the Northeast and the industrial potential of Japan, then this obstacle can be quickly overcome.

### British Commonwealth Foreign Ministers' Conference Will be Held in Ottawa

[United Press International, London, 22nd] Authoritative sources predicted on the 22nd that the location of the proposed Commonwealth Foreign Ministers' Conference in May of this year will be changed from Colombo, Ceylon, to Ottawa. It is said that senior commissioners of the Commonwealth countries discussed this change during a meeting with the Minister of Commonwealth Relations, Bagg, last week. It was pointed out that most of the Commonwealth representatives participating in this conference will first attend the UN General Assembly meeting in Lake Success, so Ottawa, Canada, will be a more convenient location.

### Mysterious Missiles Fly into the US-Occupied Zone of Germany

Experts are Confused and Cannot Understand

[United Press International, Frankfurt, 22nd] US authorities in Germany disclosed today that since October 1946, four mysterious missiles have fallen in the US-occupied zone of Germany, apparently rockets or jet-propelled objects. According to technical experts, they are still studying the fragments of the last missile, which fell on the northeastern corner of Bavaria on the 31st of last month. It is said that the four missiles all fell in the same area east of Schweinfurt, about 35 miles from the Soviet-occupied zone. The crater of the last missile was ten feet deep and seven feet wide, and it is said that the missile trailed a luminous tail as long as twenty feet. Officials pointed out that if the rockets were launched from the Soviet zone, their accuracy would be incredible, since the area where the four missiles fell was so small, so they are very puzzled.

### United States of Africa Under Planning

The next step will be to combine this new federation with the Union of South Africa, and finally to combine with the African territories of France, Belgium, Portugal, and other countries to form a United States of Africa. The unification of these African territories is of great benefit to the interests of Europe and the overseas territories of the Western European Union.

### Supervisory Committee Investigates Cases such as the National Bank's Gold and Silver Transfer to the South, Liu Zhe Believes There is Solid Evidence of Embezzlement of Relief Funds for the Northeast

[Report from this newspaper] The Supervisory Committee's Su-Zhe Regional Office of the Control Yuan is currently conducting investigations into the following cases: (1) The case of the Central Bank's transfer of gold and silver to the south. Committee member Ni Bi had previously made a preliminary investigation by visiting President Liu, but due to time constraints, he was unable to read the official documents and could not know the date and quantity of the transfer, so he plans to conduct a further investigation in the near future. (2) The issue of Northeast material disposal is being investigated by Vice President Liu Zhe. (3) The Liu Weichi case is being investigated by Committee members Yu Peihou and He Jiwei. In addition, the sale of Sun Ke's residence on Columbia Road and the Lanny's materials case are also in the planned work schedule.

[Report from this newspaper] When the Northeast Material Clearance Committee distributed relief funds for Northeast refugees in Shanghai earlier this month, it caused serious disturbances. The Control Yuan paid special attention to this. At the 35th meeting of the Yuan on the 15th, Vice President Liu Zhe, Committee members He Jizhou, and Chen Yushan and others raised cases of embezzlement of loans by the committee, looting of funds by rioters, and the committee using outsiders to distribute large sums of money to non-Northeast refugees under false pretenses. A decision was made to send personnel to investigate. Vice President Liu Zhe, Committee members He Jizhou, Chen Yushan, Zhang Jianzhong, Yu Peihou, Liu Xingzhi, Wang Shulin, and Ni Bi were responsible for conducting a thorough investigation. This reporter visited Vice President Liu, who is currently residing in Shanghai, yesterday to inquire about the development of this matter. According to him, the committee members have collected all the information on this case from all aspects. They believe that the embezzlement and looting are well-documented. For example, the committee had announced that Northeast inventor Xi Guanghou had received 450,000 yuan in relief funds, but it was found that Xi did not receive a penny and starved to death in Shanghai, and there was no money for his burial. Furthermore, it was found that a certain leader in Taicang had detained three "representatives," and it was found that these three representatives were not from the Northeast, which proves that the so-called "refugees" who received the relief funds were undoubtedly impostors. They decided to formally start investigating this case at the Supervisory Committee's office at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow (the 24th). The persons in charge of each loan who mishandled the case and the heads of the relevant agencies will be formally summoned at that time. According to Vice President Liu, in addition to focusing on the embezzlement of loans and looting by rioters, the investigation will also deny the rumors that a certain leader in Taicang distributed funds under false pretenses. He expressed deep dissatisfaction with the previous measures taken by a certain leader in Taicang.

### New Silver Coins to be Minted Order Has Not Yet Arrived A Batch of Silver Allocated to the Mint

[Report from this newspaper] On the eve of the formal promulgation of the new economic plan, the saying that silver coins would be re-issued has been confirmed by the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank. It is rumored that the new silver coins have already started to be minted. This reporter made a special inquiry to the Central Mint in this city yesterday. According to the person in charge of the mint, the mint has not received any orders regarding the minting of new silver coins to this day. As for the resumption of work in the mint, it has been going on unremittingly for three years. Recently, eight printing machines have been transported from Kunming and are currently being actively installed. Among them, four large machines are specifically used for printing patterns on silver coins. There was originally only one such machine in the mint. Once the four newly arrived machines are installed, tens of thousands of silver coins can be minted every day. It is rumored that the model of the new silver coin is based on the "boat dollar" minted in 1934, but the mint has not heard of this. However, the steel mold for the "boat dollar" is indeed readily available, complete, and preserved in the mint. If the Ministry of Finance sends an order to mint this silver coin, work can begin immediately without the need for further preparation.

[Another Report] The Central Bank has allocated a batch of its silver reserves to the Central Mint to mint new silver dollars. The mint has also decided to start smelting and minting next month. This news has been confirmed by the mint director Wei. Wei also said: Based on the mint's current financial and material resources, once minting begins, the daily output can be more than 500,000 coins. According to reliable sources, the Central Bank authorities will put the silver coins minted in 1934 from its current reserves on the market before the new silver coins are minted after the new financial and economic plan is announced.

### Food Coupons to be Distributed at the End of Next Month

According to news from the Civil Affairs Office, the rice distribution coupons for the households in this city for March have all been printed and will be collected and distributed by each district on February 27th and 28th. The rice supply has also been adequately prepared. It is rumored that a portion of flour will also be distributed in March, and the quality of this American flour is quite good.

### Land Administration Bureau Urges Payment of Land Value Tax Penalty for Late Payment to be Increased

[Report from this newspaper] The land value tax for this city this year will still be collected in two installments as in previous years. The first installment started on January 26th. The Land Administration Bureau issued approximately 170,000 payment notices, stipulating that property owners must pay within one month after receiving the notice. The total tax revenue budget is approximately 400 million, which originally accounted for more than 60% of the municipal government's revenue, but due to currency fluctuations, it now only accounts for approximately 30%. The land value tax rate is 15 per thousand of the standard land price. This year, the Municipal Council has approved an additional 5 per thousand for a self-defense donation, which is collected in full in the first installment. The areas where land value tax is collected include the Huangpu, Hunan, Fahua, Zhabei, Yinliu, and Caojing land registries. This year, the Tangqiao district has been added. Among them, the Huangpu district is the most prosperous commercial area, and its tax revenue accounts for more than 70% of the total.

The land value tax this year was initially a heavy burden for property owners, but due to drastic currency fluctuations, the value of the same amount of money is now different from before. The city treasury is currently tight, and the Land Administration Bureau hopes that all property owners can understand the difficulties of the municipal government and pay enthusiastically. According to past practice, most property owners want to delay payment until a few days before the deadline. These short days are the "peak season" for land value tax collection. This year's peak season for the first installment is approaching. In order to encourage citizens to pay on time and because the original regulations stipulated that a late payment penalty of only 15% would be added after one month, which is lower than the monthly interest rate, and is unreasonable, the Land Administration Bureau is currently drafting measures to strengthen the collection and penalties for late payment, increase the penalty rate, and submit them to the municipal government for approval for implementation in the short term.

### Second Phase of Rising Sun Building Drainage Project Progressing Rapidly

The second phase of the Rising Sun Building relief drainage project in this city has been progressing rapidly since construction began.

It is being carried out actively by the Works Bureau's regular workers and is the largest self-construction project of the Works Bureau in the past three years. The workers are skilled in the drainage project and the progress is still satisfactory. It is expected to be completed in 60 clear days (approximately early May).

### Silver Dollar Trader Declared Not Guilty Due to Lack of Explicit Punishment in the Law

[Report from this newspaper] Silver dollar trader Chen Xinchang was found by police officers on the morning of December 31 last year at the intersection of Jinling East Road and Henan Road to have purchased 23 silver dollars at the black market price of 70 yuan and 80 yuan in gold yuan notes per silver dollar. He was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecuted on suspicion of harming the national currency. Yesterday, Judge Jiang Yingqiao of the District Court announced that Chen Xinchang was not guilty. The reasons for the judgment stated: The Regulations for the Punishment of Crimes Harming the National Currency do not explicitly stipulate that the act of privately transporting and selling silver coins and copper coins in the inland should be punished, so it cannot be punished according to the regulations. The Judicial Yuan's Interpretation No. 4052 has a record of this case. The defendant in this case should be found not guilty.

### Dispute Over Silver Dollar Deposit, Cotton Mill Manager Accused

In February of the 17th year of the Republic of China, a widow, Chen Zuo, deposited 1,513 silver dollars into the Dasheng Cotton Mill for an indefinite period. When the war broke out, the mill was temporarily closed, so Chen was unable to withdraw the money. After the victory, the mill resumed operations, and Zuo negotiated with the mill. The mill initially agreed to repay the money based on the cost of living index at the time, but shortly after the currency system was reformed, the mill suddenly reneged on the agreement. Therefore, Chen Zuo had no choice but to file a lawsuit against Zhang Jingli, the manager of the mill, in the District Court. Yesterday, the case was heard by Judge Zhang Yicai of the District Court.

### Manager and Deputy Manager of Cooperative Sentenced to Imprisonment for Embezzlement

[Report from this newspaper] Tian Yaozhou, the manager of the Hongkou Branch of the Municipal Mortgage Credit Cooperative, and Xie Jiashui, the deputy manager, were engaged in managing deposits and loans for cooperative members. However, due to poor business operations, they also engaged in other businesses, which also failed. Therefore, they withdrew the deposits of cooperative members and closed the branch on the afternoon of December 7, 1948, causing the cooperative members to be unable to withdraw their money. The cooperative member Chen Changzhi and others reported the case to the Hongkou Police Branch, which arrested Tian and others and transferred them to the District Prosecutor's Office for prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Zhu Huaping concluded the trial and announced the judgment: Tian Yaozhou and Xie Jiashui colluded and intended to illegally own the items held in their possession in their business, and were each sentenced to three months of imprisonment and a fine of 3,000 yuan. If they are unable to pay the fine, they will be required to perform labor in lieu of payment, with the amount of the fine converted into the number of days of labor at a ratio of six months.

### First Batch of Communist Postal Items Arrive Letters from Xuzhou and Bengbu Received in this City

[Report from this newspaper] It was recently learned from the Municipal Postal Administration that the postal bags sent from Suhu to Nanjing on the 20th of this month contained approximately hundreds of letters originating from Xuzhou, Bengbu, and Suxian, and sent to various places in Nanjing and Shanghai, as well as a small number of letters from North Korea and Northeast China. These letters were all neatly bundled into small bundles and had Communist area stamps affixed to them. The stamps from Central China had an image of a train locomotive, with patterns on both sides and a face value of one yuan, overprinted with "revised to two hundred yuan" and the six characters "Suwan Border Region Post Office," and stamped with "Central China Liberated Area." The Bengbu Post Office stamped the date on the stamps. The back of the letter also had a rectangular rubber stamp with four lines of characters: "Bengbu Liberation Commemoration, Mail Delivery Restored, Build People's Post Office, Rapid, Accurate, and Universal." The post office guessed that these letters seemed to have been sent from Hefei and transferred to Nanjing via Wuhu. They are currently inquiring with the Wuhu Bureau to find out the details. If the guess is correct, then in the future, mail sent from Nanjing and Shanghai to the above-mentioned areas can be tried to be transferred via Wuhu.

### Educational Fellows from Xiangyang Stationed in Shanghai Public Banquet for University Presidents

[Report from this newspaper] The Fellowship Association of Educational Fellows Stationed in Shanghai held a public banquet for university presidents and the Director of the Municipal Education Bureau from 6:00 to 9:00 p.m. on the 21st. Those who attended included Zhang Yisan from Fudan University, Ou Yuanhuai from Daxia University, Zhu Guozhang from the Business College, Mao Ruli from Guanghua University, Chen Heqin from the Kindergarten Teachers College, the President of the Music College, Xia Shuyu from the Senior Vocational School, and Li Ximou, the Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, and more than ten other people. Cheng Shisheng, a representative of the Educational Department fellows, gave a speech, hoping to get assistance with the work of the fellows and find a way to solve the accommodation problem. Wan Shaozhang reported on the situation of the Educational Department fellows being assigned to affiliated agencies in Shanghai. Chen Heqin said that many young students who have moved to Shanghai are out of school. If we can imitate the methods of using space and time in Europe, America, and the Soviet Union to provide more education, for example, if each school only has one class a day, we can open three classes in the morning, afternoon, and evening. This will both accommodate educational personnel and provide relief to those who are out of school, which is a win-win situation. Wang Zhizhuo, the president of Jiaotong University, gave a reply on behalf of the attendees, and promised to help as much as possible with the task of assisting with work and accommodation problems.

### Two Railway Lines May Suspend Operations Revenue Cannot Cover Coal Costs Coal Reserves Only Enough to Last Three Days

[Report from this newspaper] According to very reliable sources, the current coal reserves for the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway lines can only last until the 25th of this month at most. If the coal supply cannot be replenished within these three days, then the trains on the two railway lines may suspend operations due to the lack of coal, following the example of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway line. It is understood that the coal problem is also the economic problem of the entire railway bureau, as well as the problem of social economy and people's purchasing power. Since January of this year, the price of coal has been rising every day. Currently, imported coal costs 57,821 yuan per ton, and Taiwanese coal costs 39,470 yuan per ton. The two railway lines use 800 tons of coal per day, requiring an average of approximately 36 million yuan, while the total daily revenue of the two lines is only more than 30 million yuan (the average revenue after adjusting fares), which is not enough to cover the cost of coal, let alone improve the treatment of employees. It is impossible to cut costs, and it is also difficult to increase revenue, because the number of formal passengers has suddenly decreased since the fare adjustment on the 12th of this month. Although the freight rate has increased fivefold, the revenue has not even increased twofold. This is a major crisis facing the railway bureau.

It raised anchor at around 5:00 a.m. yesterday, but could hardly see anything at Wusongkou, so it had to drop anchor and wait. It was still unable to sail by evening. In addition, two small ferries, Daxing and Datong, also sailed to Chongming.

The Songhu Garrison Command recently received an order from the Ministry of National Defense, stating that recently, there have been many officers and soldiers and public school personnel and students wearing untidy uniforms in various places, and there have been a few unscrupulous people gathering to cause trouble, which has disturbed public order and affected the reputation of the military.

Anyone with incomplete symbols or badges, riding on vehicles or ships, wandering along the streets, or wearing military uniforms impersonating military personnel will be detained and handed over to the nearest troop for replenishment.

### Robbery of Shoe Store Fails, Gun Fired Accidentally Injures Accomplice, Police Bureau Captures Three Criminals in Succession

[Our Dispatch] At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, two robbers suddenly entered the Wang Wanxing shoe store at No. 433 Zhoujiazui Road, under the pretext of buying shoes. They entered the inner room, pulled out a pistol, and forced the store owner's wife to hand over money and gold rings on her fingers. The store owner's wife screamed for help when she saw this. The robbers, fearing exposure, immediately fired a shot. Unexpectedly, the bullet accidentally hit the leg of another robber. In a panic, the two robbers fled out the door together. The store owner's wife chased after them and reported to the nearby Jing'an Police Sub-bureau, who reported to the Tilanqiao Sub-bureau. The Tilanqiao Sub-bureau immediately dispatched police cars and rushed to the scene, implementing a blockade and searching one by one. As a result, one of the injured robbers, named Cai Xueben, was arrested. After interrogation, he confessed to the robbery and also confessed that another accomplice was named Li Zhengzhong, who lived in a shanty town without a number on Meizhou Road, Pingliang Road. Personnel were immediately dispatched to the address to arrest Li and a pistol was found in the quilt.

### Industry Association Bitterly States the Pros and Cons, Petitions for Abolition of the Import-Export Control Committee, Numerous Obstacles After Implementation of Control, Putting Legitimate Industries in Desperate Situation

Since the government implemented the import-export control measures, due to improper execution and numerous malpractices, the industrial and commercial sectors have not benefited from it but have suffered from it. Therefore, the industrial and commercial sectors in South China and other places have proposed abolishing the import-export control agencies. The Shanghai Industry Association also expressed its support and eagerly expects it. The Import-Export Research Committee was held a few days ago and unanimously responded to the proposal of the South China industrial and commercial sectors. Yesterday, telegrams were sent to the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Industry and Commerce, stating that the drawbacks of the import-export control measures implemented over the past two years are as follows: (1) The regulations for managing the production equipment and accessories of the first category of import-export control stipulate that permits are issued for goods arriving within three months. In fact, it takes at least six months to a year for foreign orders to arrive, so very few applicants for expanding equipment and replenishing accessories are approved, crippling industrial development. (2) Most industrial raw materials must rely on foreign imports. However, the regulations for the second category of industrial raw materials under import control stipulate very small quotas, only sufficient for one-tenth or one-twentieth of actual needs, and most of them are given to middlemen, only for speculators to profit from, while the industrial sector is exploited. (3) There are no regulations for applying for waivers for the non-quota items in the third category. Cunning people use their connections, making it a hotbed of black market activity and a shortcut to speculative profits. (4) The foreign exchange earned from exports must be settled with the Central Bank. Due to the difference between the official price and the black market price, few exporters exist. Currently, Hong Kong and Japan are dumping goods in Southeast Asia, and our country's exports cannot compete with them. In summary, whether in adjusting imports, stabilizing the economy, or protecting production, the expected results have not been achieved. However, those that should be restricted or prohibited from import have not been thoroughly done, such as new luxury cars, refrigerators, radios, and various luxury goods, which flood the market. However, the examination of those that must be imported is like giving alms, with numerous obstacles and years of unresolved issues. The quotas for the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth quarters have not yet been completed. The low efficiency of handling is evident from this. The pain and losses suffered by the industrial sector are not insignificant. Therefore, after careful research by the relevant associations of this association, and based on a review of the facts and interests, five suggestions are provided: (1) It is requested that the Import-Export Control Committee be abolished immediately, and all related business should be handled by the customs. (2) In order to increase industrial production, it is necessary to fully obtain the necessary equipment and raw materials. For imports, the import of the first category of production equipment and the second category of industrial raw materials should not be restricted. The types of regulations can be proposed by each industry and submitted by the Industrial Association for revision. (3) For the numerous items listed in the third category appendix, please submit the import quantity to the Technical Committee of this association for detailed research and regulations. (4) Luxury goods and finished products or industrial raw materials that can already be self-sufficient in the country should still be strictly prohibited from import. Do not relax the ban in order to obtain high tax revenue, causing the domestic industry to be hit again. (5) For the foreign exchange earned from the export of industrial finished products, it should be requested that 100% be handed over to the factory to purchase machinery and raw materials abroad, so as to expand or improve equipment and increase production efficiency.

### Shenbao "Scholarship Fund" Launches Emergency Fundraising, Continues to Solicit 250 Shi of Rice, Aiming to Complete in a Short Period of Time

The "Reader Scholarship Fund" sponsored by Taibao, after receiving a generous donation of one million yuan from Mr. "Mo Xuming" the day before, has received donations of about 250 shi of rice before and after. It is estimated that it can help 216 middle and high school students. Although this number is close to the intended goal, it is still far behind the number of poor students who have applied for help in the past few days. The newspaper advocates the scholarship fund, and should provide universal assistance to poor students. Therefore, it has been decided to continue the emergency fundraising, hoping to raise 500 shi of rice. In other words, starting from today, another 250 shi will be raised. In addition to Mr. "Mo Xuming" generously promising to raise funds, the solicitation will be expanded further, hoping that knowledgeable people and industry and commerce giants in this city will actively donate, and strive to complete the goal in the shortest possible time. Not only are countless poor students eagerly waiting, but also the colleagues of this newspaper are very excited.

### A Soldier Dies Tragically Inside a River in Xuhong Road

[Our Dispatch] At around 8:00 p.m. the night before, an unidentified male corpse was found in the river at the east end of Shiziwan, Xuhong Road, Xujiahui, Shanghai West. The nearby villagers reported it to the Xujiahui Police Sub-bureau, and Section Chief Huang immediately ordered the police to rush to the scene to investigate. It is reported that the male corpse was over twenty years old, wearing a military uniform, with wire strangulation marks on his neck. The clothes were messy, the eyes were bulging, and the mouth was wide open. The death was very tragic. According to a boatman in the river who witnessed the incident, he caught sight of two soldiers, one running wildly and the other chasing closely, both running towards the river. Then, the former was caught up and held back, and they were twisted into a ball. Because both sides were soldiers, it was inconvenient to step forward to mediate, so he chose to enter the cabin. After a while, he suddenly heard a soldier calling for help, and then there was no sound. Later, he poked his head out to look at the shore and found a corpse on the riverbank, etc. Afterwards, a soldier told someone that the deceased was a deserter who was strangled to death by his superiors after being discovered. Whether this case is a vendetta or indeed a deserter is currently being investigated closely by the Garrison Headquarters in conjunction with the sub-bureau.

### Soaring Costs and Difficult Distribution, Book Industry Association Holds Emergency Meeting, Decides to Request Relief from Relevant Authorities

Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the publishing industry in this city has suffered from the impact of the war, blocked transportation, difficult distribution of new books, and soaring printing and binding costs. The price of new books is less than half of the cost, and the weakness of readers' purchasing power is particularly prominent. The book scarcity is even more unforgivable by the society. Now, due to the sharp rise in foreign exchange and the huge amount of money required to subscribe to newspapers, and the industry's paper inventory is not enough to supply for half a month, the situation is serious. Therefore, the Book Industry Association convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday (the 22nd) to discuss countermeasures. Resolutions were made: (1) Please the relevant departments of the government to provide relief quickly. (2) Please the Central Bank provide loans in accordance with the loan regulations for each industry to order raw materials. (3) Nine representatives, Yu Shun, Wang Zicheng, Zhou Xihe, Yu Balin, Pu Jialin, Wang Zhongming, Yao Pengyu, Liu Jikang, and Chun Sheng, were dispatched to the relevant authorities to request relief.

### Introducing Modern British Drama, British Cultural Committee's Last Lecture Today

Professor Wiley of Fudan University gave the second lecture on British drama at the British Cultural Committee lecture held at the Lester Institute of Technology on the evening of the 21st, describing British drama in the 17th and 18th centuries. Professor Wiley said that the atmosphere of protecting the theater during that period was opened by King Charles II of England, because he was very interested in drama. Professor Wiley said that comedies were the most unforgettable during that era. The biggest change that occurred in the theater at that time was that after artificial lighting was applied to the theater, the theater had become a place for court nobles to feast, and the hobbies of ordinary people were neither understood nor cared about.

The last academic lecture of the English Committee is scheduled to be held at the Lester Institute of Technology tonight (Wednesday) at 7:30 p.m. Mr. Mandy will speak on modern British drama.

[Our Dispatch] The Huili team greatly cheered up in the basketball league last night and unexpectedly defeated the strong Xiqing team Encas, 47 to 28. In the first half, 30 to 20, Huili was ahead. Huili's situation has improved since gaining new forces. After suffering setbacks for several days, the weather cleared up last night, and the clouds cleared up. They played very smoothly. Wang Yongfang and Tian Fuhai worked especially hard. Cao Zhiji fought more and more bravely in the second half. This battle was a well-deserved victory. Looking back at Encas, they were a disorganized mess, their movements were also too excessive, there was no light performance at all, and their shooting was especially poor. In Division 2 D, Chengyou won against Chongde, 49 to 35. In a friendly match, the Kang team won against Huili B by one point, 41 to 40.

Yongfang surpassed by two points, and Okhaifeng pulled it to six points. Fuhai succeeded, and the Encas team called for a break at eight to six. When the battle started again, Yongfang broke through the Huqi defense line alone. The audience was excited by this goal. The Encas team first relied on free throws to get two points, and Okha's ball and Begni's two free throws resulted in Fuhai's far shot, making it ten and twelve, tied twice, which seemed to be a game that was difficult to determine the winner. V. Cairo Ski took the lead with two points, and Fuhai made it 14 each again, which was difficult to distinguish. Zhiji scored a free throw, which gave him a breath of fresh air. Qikun, Fuhai, and Yongfang frequently showed their magical powers, and "A Wang" was especially brilliant. At 25 to 18, Huili was at ease and began to lead. Within three minutes, they added several more goals. The opponent Sasikin replaced Okha. In the first half, Huili had 30 points and Encas had 20 points.

In the second half, Yongfang and Zhiji still fought hard, and the situation was average with the opponent. Yunshan and Que Leboto fought for length, 38 to 28. Begni replaced Gebeng Qi Gufu, and Encas's car wheel tactics gradually approached and increased the pressure. The score was chased to 34 to 39. Fortunately, Huili responded with all its strength and was still able to maintain a ten-point lead in the last five minutes. At 45 to 38, Que Li committed five fouls and was replaced by Sasikin. The two sides were in a melee, and Encas's actions were especially barbaric. The final result was 47 to 38. Huili defeated Encas.

In another match, US team captain Freeman overwhelmed Penang Chinese Wei Taihe (transliteration) 15-10, 10-15, 15-4. Freeman is known for his aggressive play and has never lost since participating in the Thomas Cup, but he lost one set in the second game because Wei's net defense was tight.

Yesterday, the money market saw a slight improvement due to significant advances by banks and bureaus the day before, with small exchanges exceeding 1.2 billion yuan. The supply of funds became scarcer, with internal supplies decreasing and turnover becoming more frequent. Interest rates on loans peaked at 80 yuan, but generally stood at 70 yuan.

### Yarn and Cloth Show Overall Weakness

Yesterday, yarn and cloth showed weakness from the beginning. The reason for this was that customers were not clearing goods smoothly. Although local merchants were taking deliveries, the quantity was very small. In addition, before the new economic plan is announced, most buyers are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Small investors in the market were pressured by interest rates and were unwilling to hold on, selling at higher prices. As a result, all yarns tended to soften.

### Reader Consultation, Legal Interpretation, Parents Made a Marriage Agreement When the Person Was Young, The Party Can Apply for Rescission

Compensation for Losses Can Be Claimed if the Other Party is Not at Fault

Zhang Xinmin asks: Miss A is now 26 years old. When she was three years old, her parents made a marriage agreement with Mr. B. After Miss A reached adulthood, she did not recognize this marriage agreement. Now the original matchmaker has died, and Miss A is in love with Mr. C, but Mr. B is unwilling to give up the marriage agreement. Question: (1) Is it legal for Miss A to marry Mr. C? (2) If Miss A only publishes a formal denial notice in her hometown newspaper, can it be regarded that the previous marriage agreement has become invalid? (3) If Miss A formally notifies Mr. B through a witness (such as a lawyer) declaring denial, and Mr. B refuses to answer or even expresses unwillingness, is it illegal for Miss A to marry Mr. C immediately? (4) Does Mr. B have the right to demand compensation for losses from Miss A or Mr. C? (5) Is there a time limit? (6) Does Mr. C bear any legal responsibility in this matter?

[Mr. Tang Mingshi answers] (1) If Miss A wants to make another marriage agreement with Mr. C, she must rescind the marriage agreement with Mr. B. (2) The procedure for rescinding a marriage agreement must be determined according to the circumstances. In this case, although Miss A has not admitted the agreement, it is also said that she has not denied it. Are there other circumstances sufficient to prove that she did not deny it and is waiting for marriage? Therefore, publishing in the newspaper is a procedure, but publishing in the newspaper does not make the marriage agreement invalid. (3) Hiring a lawyer to handle the procedures is the correct approach. The entire circumstances should be discussed in detail with the lawyer, and the previous marriage agreement should be rescinded before another marriage can be made. Do not act rashly to avoid causing trouble. (4) If the other party to the previous marriage agreement is not at fault, they can of course demand compensation for losses. (5) If a marriage agreement is made by parents on behalf of a minor, those who cannot agree should express it when they reach adulthood. After reaching adulthood, if there is no expression, it must be determined according to the circumstances. Therefore, time is indeed a problem. (6) If Mr. C is not aware of the situation, he will not be held responsible.
