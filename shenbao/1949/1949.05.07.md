### Yan Xishan Writes Poetry

Guangdong and Guangzhou Mass Organizations Present Banners Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 6th] Mass organizations in Guangdong and Guangzhou presented brocade banners to General Yan Xishan at 10:00 AM on the 6th as a mark of respect. Furthermore, after returning to Guangzhou from Guilin this time, Yan wrote a poem for his own reflection, titled "Feelings on Crossing the Haizhu Bridge," which reads: "Steel and concrete are tightly joined, but swallows and doves separate, singing mournfully. Crossing the great river relies on this magnificent bridge."

[United Press, Guangzhou, 6th] Yan Xishan arrived here from Guilin a few days ago. According to what he told a United Press reporter today: There are three conditions for Acting President Li to resume his duties: namely, military expenses, munitions, and full administrative authority. These demands are very simple. If the conditions are fulfilled, Li can come to Guangdong. President Chiang believes that Li's success or failure is his own success or failure, and Chiang has agreed to Li using Taiwan's military and financial resources. Yan strongly stated that close cooperation is essential between the party leader and the acting president. Military resources should be supplied to those who truly need them in the future, which was not the case in the past. There is nothing inappropriate in organizing a Supreme Political Council, with President Chiang as chairman and Acting President Li as vice-chairman. The party leader in other countries is often the head of state, but this is not the case in China. The political council is purely an internal political organization of the party and has no relationship with the government's administration.

### Guangzhou to Various Places Telephone Charges Temporarily Reduced by Half

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th] Electricity Bureau News: The long-distance telephone service between Guangzhou and Hong Kong has been changed to one silver dollar from this month's 6th. Now, in order to reduce the burden on users, the electricity bureau will temporarily reduce the domestic long-distance telephone charges by half, starting today. For example, the current charge for each Guangzhou to Jiangmen long-distance telephone call is one dollar and two jiao in silver dollars, which will be reduced to six jiao in silver dollars from today. The current charge for each Guangzhou to Shanghai long-distance telephone call is eight dollars and one jiao in silver dollars, which will be reduced to four dollars and five fen in silver dollars from today. Other places can be used as examples to maintain this. In addition, express telephones originally charged five times the urgent call fee, but now they are also reduced to five times the ordinary fee.

### Bai Chongxi Flew to Changsha Yesterday, Strongly Criticizing Local Peace Talks in Hunan, Hubei, and Guangxi

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 6th] Chief Executive Bai Chongxi and Chairman Zhang Zhen of Henan flew to Changsha for official business at noon on the 6th and are expected to return to Hankou tonight or tomorrow morning. The other side attaches great importance to Bai's trip. In addition, staff members of the Henan Provincial Government left in Hubei will move to Hengge for office within days.

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 6th] General Bai Chongxi arrived in Changsha today. According to what he told reporters: This trip is to visit Chairman Cheng and his old friend General Tang Shengzhi. Bai strongly criticized the brewing of local peace talks in Hunan, Hubei, and Guangxi, saying that this is purely a communist plot to divide and poison, and emphasized the tragic situation encountered by Fu's unit in Peiping, which should serve as a factual lesson that local peace is unreliable. The communist bandits have no such thing as peace with the same unit except for individual slaughter. We should be especially vigilant. When discussing the issue of the joint defense of the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Guangxi, he said that under the central government's governance, any local area should strengthen its anti-rebellion deployment, not limited to the joint defense of the three provinces. Regarding the overall war situation, the national army has major new deployments, and the situation will improve soon.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 6th] The situation in Wuhan is relaxed on the surface but tense within. People in general, in view of the increasing atmosphere of war, are not as tranquil as before. The number of passengers evacuating by water and land routes has increased day by day. At the same time, a certain unit of the garrison tested land mines and artillery shelling on the 6th.

### Gu Weijun Appeals in the United States for the Establishment of a Pacific Treaty; The Chinese People Hope for Moral and Material Assistance from the United States

[Associated Press, Trenton, New Jersey, 5th] Gu Weijun, Chinese Ambassador to the United States, appealed on the 5th for the establishment of a Pacific Security Treaty. Gu warned that if China falls into the hands of the communist army, all of Asia will be "reddened."

Governor Darrascott of New Jersey hosted a banquet for Gu on the 5th. At the banquet, Gu said, "The danger of the spread of communism is like a flood. To effectively prevent this danger, a complete levee must be built. If important parts are exposed and not protected, the entire levee may be shattered. The North Atlantic Treaty is to implement this basic purpose, but more such a series of treaties covering all important regions are needed. Letting any part of this region, such as China, be left to its fate is tantamount to making a large part of this necessary levee empty."

Gu also said: "When the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty have made great achievements in the path of peace, freedom, organization, and prevention of communist policy's important parts. If the same measures are implemented in Asia, the Far East, and other important regions, it will also produce favorable consequences in the long run. China's current crisis "is like a fire field" that must be extinguished. This is not for China's sake, but for the sake of freedom in Asia and world peace. If it is not stopped in time, the consequences will be disastrous."

"The Chinese people hope for moral and material assistance from the United States. Recently, some sectors in the United States seem hesitant about helping China and have many criticisms, but this is not something he can disclose publicly."

"According to him, the urgent task at present is not in the past but in the present and the future. Important issues can be dealt with from the standpoint of common interests to prevent and deal with the serious situation."

"Although the situation in China is serious, it is not too late to reverse it in time. He believes that American politicians, with their traditional friendship, lofty goals, and vast resources, are very conducive to helping China resolve the situation. The path of freedom and democracy is waiting to be measured and decided."

### A Hong Kong Police Boat Mutinies; Many Police Officers Are Killed

### Claim That the United States Intends to Recognize the Communist Chinese Regime; Acheson Strictly Denies It; Says There Are No New Soviet Sympathizers in the State Department

[United Press, Washington, 6th] Secretary of State Acheson on the 6th denounced as "absolutely false" a rumor that the Berlin blockade negotiations involved the United States accepting the Soviet Union's views on the China issue. At the time, Acheson was giving his opinion to the Senate Appropriations Committee. Democratic Senator McCarran quoted a newspaper editorial discussing this rumor and asked Acheson for his views. Acheson replied that this rumor was absolutely absurd. Regarding McCarran's statement that Soviet sympathizers in the State Department were drafting a solution to the Soviet issue, including recognizing the new government of the Chinese Communist Party, Acheson also categorically denied it, saying that there were no Soviet sympathizers in the State Department, nor was there such a plan.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th] After the Legislative Yuan moved from Nanjing to Guangzhou, it held its first session on the 6th in the Guangdong Provincial Assembly Hall, attended by 209 legislators. According to the 6th session, it was the 17th meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan. At 9:30 AM, President Tong Guanxian announced the opening of the meeting.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th] Legislator Xiao Zheng and six others proposed a temporary motion at the 17th meeting of the Legislative Yuan, which stated: It is proposed to consult the Executive Yuan to take emergency measures to consolidate the military and financial strength of the location of the provisional capital, stabilize the people's livelihood, and promote morale. Since the fall of the capital, Guangzhou has become the provisional capital of our country's government during this extraordinary period and the center of politics and military affairs. However, although the people of Guangdong are strong, they have supported the suppression of the rebellion and supplied military needs for many years, and their strength has long been exhausted. The local finances are already in a difficult situation, and the military strength is especially weak. If they are not quickly replenished, it will be difficult to establish the foundation for the anti-communist war. Therefore, it is specifically proposed that the Legislative Yuan resolve to consult the Executive Yuan to quickly take the following emergency measures and begin to implement them within one week so that they can adapt to the timing: (1) Order the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters to jointly compile nine armies with the Guangdong Provincial Government, and the central government will allocate equipment and funding for their establishment. (2) The national government will bear the expenses of the Guangdong Provincial Security Forces and quickly allocate equipment to replenish their strength to facilitate the suppression of bandits. (3) Various ministries of national defense, transportation, and economy will quickly allocate funds and jointly strengthen the airports, highways, telecommunications, bridges, and other military-related industrial facilities with the Guangdong Provincial Government. (4) Relevant ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan will assist the Guangdong Provincial Government in organizing and training the people to jointly assume the responsibility of the anti-communist war. All expenses will be borne by the central government. The resolution was passed and sent to the Executive Yuan for execution.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th] Legislator Pan Chaoying and others proposed a temporary motion at the meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the afternoon of the 6th, requesting that Executive Yuan President He Yingqin report to the Yuan on the breakdown of the peace talks and the government's withdrawal from Nanjing.

The government is moving to Guangzhou, and Nanjing is withdrawing. At this time of serious national crisis, it is imperative that the whole country, from top to bottom, unite as one and unite in good faith. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek called on the people of the whole country in a communiqué a few days ago to boost their spirits, persevere, support Acting President Li in leading the national military and civilians to fight to the end, in order to save the country from danger and rescue our people from fire and water, and to repay the country's peril.

### Editorial: Prevent Fires Before They Start!

Recently, the people of Shanghai have been troubled by the current situation and can be said to be extremely worried and anxious, feeling at a loss. From top to bottom, everyone is nervously preparing for the worst. Unexpectedly, on May 4th, a fire of unprecedented scale in many years broke out out of nowhere, which was truly like encountering a headwind in a leaky boat; misfortunes never come singly. According to the mayor's broadcast and news from various newspapers, at 2:05 PM that afternoon, a fire broke out in Sujiajiao, Xinxijie, in the French Concession, and raged for four hours and ten minutes. Even at 6:15 PM, the embers had not yet been extinguished, resembling a pit of fire. More than 3,200 shanties were affected, leaving around 20,000 displaced victims. The burnt area exceeded 200,000 square meters, which is half the size of Zhongshan Park. The fire field stretched for over one mile, and more than a dozen factories of varying sizes were also destroyed by the blaze. Over 40 fire trucks were dispatched, and more than 500 firefighters participated in the firefighting efforts. Two pump trucks were burned, and a great number of water hoses were damaged. The burned corpses resembled charred wood, a truly tragic sight to behold.

Water can carry a boat, but it can also capsize it. The same is true of fire; it can save lives, but it can also take them. Fire is an accidental disaster, but also a family disaster. Statistics are rarely seen in our country, so let us borrow those of the United States for reference. The United States participated in World War II for three years and eight months, during which the number of deaths in the army and navy reached over 270,000, and the number of injured exceeded 650,000. However, in the three years following the war, 118,000 people died due to accidental family incidents, 480,000 were permanently injured, and 17,450,000 suffered disabilities, incapacitation, or injuries that prevented them from working. Among family disasters, falls accounted for the highest number of deaths, totaling 16,000, followed by burns at 5,600. Asphyxiation ranked third at 2,000, while poisoning was fourth at 1,500. Gunshot deaths accounted for 1,200, and the remaining 57,800 deaths were due to other causes. The majority of deaths occurred among the elderly and children, with those over 65 years old accounting for 55% of the casualties, and children under 5 years old accounting for 18%. The annual losses from family disasters in the United States amounted to $550,000,000, but this figure only refers to wages, medical expenses, and insurance premiums.

China's population is three times that of the United States. If this kind of loss is calculated proportionally to the population, then the losses suffered by China each year due to family disasters would amount to $2.2 billion USD. If we could save this enormous sum, why would we still need to beg for American aid? The losses from this fire in Shanghai cannot be calculated to this day, and perhaps will never be accurately calculated. Isn't this a clear example of a huge financial loss? In addition to family disasters, there are also other accidental disasters. In the United States in 1943, the number of deaths and injuries could stretch from New York to San Francisco, with the number of deaths reaching 97,000, enough to form a city. The number of injuries equaled the population of New York and Chicago combined. The losses from injuries amounted to $4.9 billion USD, and 380,000,000 man-days were lost. Among these, automobile accidents caused 20,000 deaths and 800,000 injuries, while 32,000 deaths occurred in homes, with approximately 5 million injuries. In that year alone, the losses from family disasters amounted to $6 billion USD.

Medical science is advancing rapidly, and infectious diseases have been greatly reduced. Today, the rising mortality rate in Western societies is not due to lung disease, cholera, typhoid, or diphtheria, but to accidental injuries. In 1900, accidental injuries in the United States accounted for 65.4% of all mortality rates nationwide, ranking ninth in causes of death. By 1947, however, it had risen to fourth place, accounting for 71.2% of the mortality rate. Westerners also have a saying: "The more advanced the culture, the more unexpected disasters occur." This is true, because the more advanced the culture, the more inventions there are. For everything there are advantages and disadvantages. The invention of machines is a symbol of cultural progress, but careless use of machines can kill people. Automobiles help us travel incredibly quickly, but they also kill the most people. It is said that entering a street is like entering a tiger's mouth, and this man-eating tiger is the automobile. In civilized societies, the use of civilized products has already caused too much harm. In societies with less wisdom, the harm caused by the use of civilized products will certainly be even greater. This is true in peacetime, and even more so in wartime. The number of accidents involving ships, airplanes, and trains in China over the years is countless.

Speaking of fires in Shanghai, due to the high population density and accumulation of materials, the possibility of fire is greatest, and even a small spark can easily start a prairie fire. The severity of the disaster is greater than in any other city. There is no need to talk about fires that occurred too long ago. Taking recent situations into account, no one will forget the three major fires that occurred in January of this year. The first was the major fire on Zhongxing Road in Zhabei on January 6th, which destroyed five or six hundred grass-roofed houses. The second was the fire on Duojia Road in Nanshi on January 8th, which destroyed over two hundred shanties. The third was the major fire on Guangzhao Road on January 12th, which destroyed over six hundred shanties. The number of victims who were burned out of their homes and lost their families reached several thousand. This tragic picture, which is appalling and devastating, is now reappearing before our eyes. How can it not be alarming and terrifying! But the way to fight fire is to prevent it before it starts.

Safety education is a method of preventing problems before they occur. The more valuable life is, the more developed safety education is. The West has the slogan "Safety First." The establishment of a safety plan must involve everyone and must be implemented forcefully. Every family, neighbor, and colleague must abide by safety rules. Today, Shanghai urgently needs to implement safety education. Among safety measures, fire prevention is the most important. In Shanghai's past fires, 90% of them started in shanties. The Bureau of Public Works and the Police Department cannot shirk their responsibility. Let's not talk about the existing shanties for now. Why is the government turning a deaf ear to shanties that are being built? For example, countless shanties have been built by those relocated from Toutiao Bridge on Qimei Road. Two municipal schools have jointly requested the Police Department and the Bureau of Public Works to find a way to stop this, but the authorities have ignored them to this day. What is the reason for this? What is the municipal leader doing about this? This is just one example; there are probably many similar situations! To remove the chimney and move the firewood away from the stove is always better than working with scorched heads and singed eyebrows!

### Plot to Incite the "Fuxing" Cruiser Mutiny: Five Masterminds Executed by Firing Squad Today; Captain Chen Ganting's Conspiracy Exposed and Defeated

[Report from this Newspaper] At the beginning of last month, the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters received important intelligence that the Communist army in northern Jiangsu had dispatched senior personnel to Shanghai to incite a mutiny on the "Fuxing" cruiser. Given the gravity of the case, Commander-in-Chief Tang secretly ordered Police Chief Mao Sen of this city to be responsible for the investigation. After two weeks, the case was finally solved. The main culprits, Chen Ganting (current captain of the "Fuxing" cruiser of the Coastal Water Police of Jiangsu Province), Tang Xinmin (staff officer of the 9th Military Subdistrict of the Communist side), Li Derong (liaison officer of the 9th Military Subdistrict of the Communist side), Li Junshi (liaison officer dispatched by the Communist side to the "Fuxing" cruiser), and Qian Peijun (traitorous merchant), a total of five persons, were apprehended one after another. After separate interrogations confirmed the facts, they were submitted for approval of the death penalty and will be executed today. It is reported that Tang, Li, Qian, and the other three arrived in Shanghai from Nantong on the third of last month and secretly discussed a mutiny plan with Chen Ganting, captain of the "Fuxing" cruiser of the Coastal Water Police Bureau of Jiangsu Province, who had come to Shanghai from the Fushan defense area. The authorities dispatched personnel on the 9th to capture Tang and the other four at the Dongya and Southeast hotels respectively. After an all-night interrogation, it was learned that Chen Ganting had been in contact with Shi Yafu, chief of staff of the 9th Military Subdistrict of the Communist side, and had been receiving large monthly subsidies from the Communist side to plot wrongdoing. He also confessed that Chen resided at the Tianjin Apartment on Shunchang Road in this city. Personnel were dispatched on the afternoon of the 10th to apprehend Chen Ganting in front of the Yameng Grand Theater nearby. After interrogation, he confessed that he had known Shi Yafu since 1938. Soon after, they became sworn brothers due to their shared ideals. When the war shifted to the Jiangbian area, Shi dispatched liaison officer Li Derong with four taels of gold to contact him on the cruiser, hoping to act as an internal response when the Communist army crossed the river, and to contact other National Army troops not to obstruct the river crossing. If necessary, the "Fuxing" cruiser should take the lead in "uprising" to assist in the river crossing operation. Later, Shi sent Li Junshi to serve as a liaison and intelligence officer on his cruiser. At the beginning of April, he again sent staff officer Tang Xinmin, accompanied by merchant Qian Peijun, to the cruiser to investigate the number of the National Army stationed locally and the situation of the bridgeheads, and agreed to meet in Shanghai to discuss the mutiny plan, which was ultimately captured by the Shanghai Police Department.

### Chaotic Financial Market in Hankou: Over a Hundred Businesses Collapse

[Report from Hankou, this Newspaper, 6th] The financial market here is becoming increasingly chaotic.

### US Senator Calls for Restoration of Free Gold Market

[Report from United Press, Washington, 5th] Democratic Senator McCarran today advocated restoring a free gold market in the United States, and denounced the current restrictions on private individuals buying and holding gold in the United States as "absurd." He asked the Senate Judiciary Committee to recommend the lifting of restrictions on gold trading and to continue the gold standard, with the Treasury Department purchasing gold at $35 per ounce. According to McCarran, the Treasury Department has purchased gold worth more than $3.7 billion in two years, 96% of which came from abroad. The Treasury Department has never explained what it intends to do with this huge amount of gold, nor has it formulated any policies. At this critical time, we should seriously consider the use and disposal of this gold. A free gold market can make exchange rates more volatile, help establish a sound monetary policy, and promote domestic and international stability.

### US Occupation Costs in Japan: 500 Million Dollars Annually; US Must Relieve This Burden

[Report from United Press, London, 5th] According to sources in the American diplomatic community today, the United States has proposed to the Far Eastern Commission that "Japan be allowed to borrow foreign debts and enter into commercial and economic agreements with various countries." The Far Eastern Commission will discuss this, but it is heard that Britain and France have "firmly expressed their opposition." The British Foreign Office did not comment on this matter. It is understood that the US policy is to make the occupation forces only "a protective force," and to give as much authority as possible to the Japanese government. The cost of the US occupation of Japan is about 500 million dollars annually. If this burden is to be relieved, Japan must be able to borrow money, trade, and be self-governing. The reason why the United States has made concrete proposals to the Far Eastern Commission is precisely this.

Detailed Record of British House of Commons Debate on China Issue

[Report from United Press, London, 5th] The British House of Commons debated the situation in China on the 5th. The government stated that it was adopting a policy of non-interference in China, but the Conservative Party demanded that the government take action to prevent the spread of communism in the Far East.

[Report from United Press, London, 5th] During the House of Commons debate on the shelling of British warships on the Yangtze River on the 5th, Defense Minister Alexander said that according to reports from those involved, the incident was an accident that later escalated, and was not deliberate or premeditated. Britain is eager to avoid interfering in the Chinese civil war, but will not show weakness with regard to territories for which we are directly responsible. The government is closely monitoring Hong Kong. Prime Minister Attlee also said in the House of Commons that the Communist army's shelling of British warships was not a planned action, and that the bombardment of foreign warships sailing upstream on the Yangtze River was possible. When Attlee mentioned a suggestion that the government should recognize the Chinese Communist Party, he said, "This matter must be judged based on the actions of the Chinese Communist Party. It is not the time to discuss this matter at present."

Conservative Party's Butler on Hong Kong's Defense

[Report from United Press, London, 5th] Butler, who has been repeatedly rumored to be the successor to the leader of the Conservative Party, concluded the House of Commons debate on the Chinese Communist army's shelling of British warships tonight by saying that the true defense of Hong Kong relies less on troops and more on mobilizing British diplomatic and strategic resources to unite the countries of the Far East as in the West. "I would like to see the United States, India, Italy, the Netherlands, and France come together to unite our strengths so that we can be guaranteed to have a treaty in the East to prevent war, as has already been seen in the West."

British Ambassador Still Staying in Nanjing, Macmillan Says Inappropriate

[Report from Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] During the House of Commons debate on the Yangtze River incident on the 5th, Defense Minister Alexander said that the Chinese Communist authorities have so far refused all contact attempted by British consular officials. Conservative leader Macmillan attacked the government's mismanagement and inefficiency in handling the situation in China when the House of Commons began debating it this afternoon. Macmillan said: "I don't understand why the British ambassador needs to stay in Nanjing. The government should have recalled him long ago and left a chargé d'affaires to perform his duties." Referring to the Amethyst incident, Macmillan said: "It is unwise to send warships deep inland and far away from the outside world." He praised the courage of the British naval soldiers, but said: "This accident shows the decline of our strength and judgment." Macmillan continued by asking, "Will communism devour China, or will China annex communism? I believe that British trade still has a chance to carry out effective tasks in China."

Large Numbers of Army, Navy, and Air Force Troops Open to Hong Kong for Reinforcement

[Report from Reuters, London, 5th] Defense Minister Alexander recently told the House of Commons that Britain is sending a large number of reinforcements to Hong Kong, including army, navy, and air force troops, which will increase the British army in Hong Kong to two brigades, each brigade including three battalions, upon arrival. In addition, there are special forces, including tanks, field guns, anti-aircraft guns, flat-shooting gun units, etc. The air force reinforcement units include fighter planes. The naval fleet in Hong Kong will add a cruiser and, if necessary, an aircraft carrier. Alexander stated that although Britain is making every effort to avoid being involved in the war on the Chinese mainland, Britain will take a resolute attitude towards territories for which it is directly responsible. Hong Kong's policy of maintaining neutrality and non-interference in Chinese politics has a long tradition. The British government has always maintained a policy of non-interference in the Chinese civil war, while at the same time taking a very cautious attitude in Hong Kong. In deciding to protect Hong Kong with other measures, the British government's motives are solely to ensure that the unstable situation in China does not endanger the safety of the people of Hong Kong or impede the peaceful conduct of legitimate trade with China via Hong Kong. Alexander also mentioned Hong Kong's police force, saying that the local police force has now more than doubled compared to the 1,220 in 1941, and that the recruitment of the Hong Kong volunteer defense force is also underway, but the results have not been entirely satisfactory.

Hong Kong's Traditional Neutral Policy Benefits All Parties

Talking about Hong Kong's traditional neutral policy, Alexander pointed out that both the Chinese Kuomintang and Communist parties have enjoyed the benefits of Hong Kong's neutral policy. The only condition they should abide by is to abide by Hong Kong law and not engage in actions that damage Sino-British relations. The steps currently being taken by the British authorities will be used to deal with any behavior that disrupts the living conditions of the Chinese in the area, whether Kuomintang or Communist, or disrupts peace. Regardless of how these disruptive behaviors are caused, in the public interest, it is currently inconvenient to disclose their details. Alexander also said that Hong Kong's food situation is generally satisfactory, with a very sufficient supply of rice. The authorities have also taken steps to prepare for food storage. Opposition spokesman MacLennan believed that the best way to defend Hong Kong is for the British government to clearly state that an attack on Hong Kong will be regarded as an act of aggression, with the necessary consequences. Hong Kong is the Gibraltar of the East and must be defended. Britain's major interests in Malaya and Singapore are closely related to Hong Kong. MacLennan emphasized that Britain has many friends in Asia, but they need comfort, so Britain must instill a spirit of trust in Asia, and the Western partnership system based on the American people must be able to extend to the East.

The Lister Shire Regiment of British Troops Scheduled to Open Hong Kong on the 11th

British Newspapers Attach Importance to the Issue of Strengthening Hong Kong's Defenses

[Report from Agence France-Presse, London, 6th] All newspapers here on the 6th published in a prominent position the news of strengthening Hong Kong's defenses during yesterday's House of Commons debate on the China issue. The Conservative "Daily Mail" said, "Indeed, we will own Hong Kong." The left-wing "Daily Mirror" ran a large headline saying, "Send planes, artillery, and troops to Hong Kong." The Conservative "Daily Express" asked: "Are sixty troops enough to defend Hong Kong?" The Times commented, "Defense Minister Alexander made a clear distinction between Britain's policy towards China and the policy taken towards territories for which Britain is responsible. In mainland China, British diplomatic and consular representatives are still staying in their posts and attempting to make contact with the Chinese Communist authorities to protect British citizens and their interests. The defense of Hong Kong and the maintenance of legitimate commerce are Britain's direct responsibilities. Therefore, measures have been taken to strengthen its internal security and send additional army, navy, and air force troops." The Conservative "Daily Telegraph" opposed a suggestion from a Labour MP that Britain should immediately recognize the Chinese Communist regime, saying, "We must not immediately recognize this Chinese Communist regime that massacred our navy and does not accept our protests." On the issue of recognizing the Chinese Communist Party, The Times said, "The Prime Minister said that the Chinese Communist Party will be judged by its actions. This is indeed a wise answer."

British Government Maintains Closest Contact with Consul General in Shanghai

[Report from Reuters, London, 5th] Defense Minister Alexander said during the House of Commons debate on the situation in China on the 5th that the British government has maintained the closest contact with the British Consul General in Shanghai on the measures that will be taken in an emergency. The purpose of these measures is to provide the British citizens there with the protection that is possible in the current environment and to allow them to evacuate when necessary and at their own will. Alexander also said that in addition to the military situation, the British government is also seriously concerned about the financial and economic situation in Shanghai. Although the final remedy for these situations should be taken by the Chinese, the local British citizens have been discussing this with the British Consul General in Shanghai. In short, the British government will continue to implement its peaceful policies and assist British citizens on the most possible basis.

British Broadcasting Corporation Suspends Broadcast of "Slow Boat to China" Song

### Future Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference: U.S. Determined to Strive for a Proactive Position; Hopes to Resolve German and Austrian Issues Simultaneously; USSR May Suggest Dividing World Spheres of Influence

[Report from United Press, Washington, 6th] According to several indications, senior diplomatic advisors are urging Secretary of State Acheson to take a proactive position in the Paris Four-Power Conference, otherwise the Soviet Union will use the conference to launch a major propaganda offensive against the German people. They believe that the Soviet Union may put forward the following three proposals: (1) Unify all of Germany under a central German government; (2) Accelerate the withdrawal of occupying forces; (3) Accelerate the completion of the final peace treaty with Germany. These three proposals will undoubtedly receive the support of German nationalists. It is clear that the State Department is drafting a plan to deal with and defeat the Soviet Union's proposal. Although it has not yet been completed, some officials pointed out that Western countries may ask the Soviet Union to agree to a peaceful settlement of the Austrian issue. This move would force the Soviet Union to withdraw its troops from Austria, Hungary, and Romania, and weaken the Soviet Union's power in the satellite countries of Southeastern Europe.

[Report from United Press, Washington, 5th] State Department spokesman McDermott revealed on the 5th that U.S. Ambassador-at-Large Jessup, who is responsible for the initial negotiations to lift the Berlin blockade, may accompany Secretary of State Acheson to Paris to attend the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference on May 23. He said that the formal agenda of the meeting has not yet been finalized. He also said that the Austrian issue may be included in the agenda because it is related to the German issue.

[Report from United Press, Washington, 6th] A speculation arose in diplomatic circles on the 6th that the Soviet Union may propose a "secret agreement" to the United States at the Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, formally dividing the world into two major spheres of influence. Observers with this view said that the Soviet Union may suggest: (1) The United States recognize the Chinese Communist regime, adopt a "hands-off" policy in China, and recognize China as a permanent sphere of influence for the Soviet Union. (2) The Soviet Union will stop its divisive movements in Western Europe and agree to resolve the German and Austrian issues in a democratic manner. U.S. officials pointed out that this move would undoubtedly be rejected by Secretary of State Acheson, because the United States is absolutely opposed to any form of secret agreement.

[Report from Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 5th] British occupation forces commander Robertson predicted at a press conference today that a German central government will be established soon. Robertson said that if the Four-Power Conference can proceed smoothly after the blockade is lifted, then the establishment of a pan-German central government is not far away. Robertson believes that under the provisions of the Bonn Constitution, Germans can obtain a peaceful, happy, and proud life, and hopes that the East German local government will be willing to participate in the federal government in accordance with the Bonn Constitution. This is not impossible. At the same time, the German Communist Party issued a declaration in Frankfurt, demanding the immediate cessation of work on the establishment of West Germany, pointing out that the German leaders who drafted the constitution in Bonn should not "undermine" the possibility of the success of the Paris Four-Power negotiations.

### Key Points of the European Parliament Charter: To Promote Economic and Social Progress. Inaugural Meeting of the Preparatory Committee Held in France on Tuesday

[Reuters, London, 5th] The Foreign Ministers of nine countries, namely England, France, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, along with the Belgian Ambassador, signed the charter establishing the European Parliament today. The charter stipulates that the purpose of the European Parliament is to achieve greater unity to preserve common inherited civilization and to realize economic and social progress.

The European Parliament is divided into two bodies: a committee composed of representatives of each government, and a consultative assembly.

The Consultative Assembly has 87 members: 18 each from England, France, and Italy; 6 each from the Netherlands, Belgium, and Sweden; 4 each from Denmark, Norway, and Ireland; and 3 from Luxembourg. The Consultative Assembly may discuss any issue submitted by the Committee of Foreign Ministers, and a resolution is established if passed by a two-thirds vote of the members. Following the conclusion of negotiations for the establishment of the European Parliament, the following communiqué was issued, expressing the hope that the first meeting of the European Parliament would be convened in Strasbourg in August, and that this inaugural meeting would be the most significant event in European history.

Consider Membership of Greece and Turkey Acceptable: Regarding the requests of the Greek and Turkish governments to join the organization, the communiqué stated that these declarations were considered acceptable by the initiating countries and would be discussed after the establishment of a committee under the European Parliament. This committee will also study the possibility of other countries participating in the European Parliament. The communiqué also stated that the Foreign Ministers held the first meeting of the Preparatory Committee today under the chairmanship of Mr. Schuman, appointed Mr. Paris of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs as Secretary-General, and decided that the next meeting of the Preparatory Committee would be held in Paris on May 11. The communiqué also specifically stated that matters related to defense are not within the scope of discussion of the European Parliament.

### Wallace Opposes the Atlantic Pact

During the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, the US Senate Should Suspend Action

[Reuters, Washington, 5th] Upon hearing that the four powers had agreed to lift the Berlin Blockade, US Progressive Party leader Wallace said that he advocated that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee should suspend action on the Atlantic Pact currently under review before convening the Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the German question. He emphatically stated that this was the greatest and the last opportunity to resolve disputes with the Soviet Union peacefully. He also accused the US government of deliberately not announcing the news that the Soviet Union had proposed lifting the Berlin Blockade to the US on March 21, to avoid hindering the establishment of the Atlantic Pact.

Large Quantities of Propaganda Documents Seized

[United Press, Berlin, 6th] Police in the American-occupied zone of Germany today cracked down on an illegal meeting of the Communist-aligned Socialist Unity Party, arresting 20 people and seizing a large quantity of Communist documents. These documents revealed the Soviet Union's possible intentions at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris: (1) to obtain a four-power agreement to permanently exclude Germany from the new European Federation and the Atlantic Treaty; (2) to abolish the regulations of the Western six countries on the control of the Ruhr industrial area and to recognize the Soviet Union's interests in the Ruhr region; (3) to abolish the major policies toward Germany adopted by the US, Britain, and France without the consent of the Soviet Union, including the establishment of the West German Republic; and (4) to establish an all-German government that will continue the "democratic measures" already implemented in the Soviet-occupied zone.

### No Need to Convene a Four-Power Summit

President Truman's Statement

[Reuters, Washington, 6th] President Truman stated at his weekly press conference yesterday that there was currently no need to hold a four-power summit to resolve the dispute over the German question. If the Four-Power Foreign Ministers reach an agreement on the German question at their meeting in Paris at the end of the month, there will be no need to hold a four-power summit at all.

### Moscow's Reaction

[Reuters, Moscow, 5th] After Moscow Radio officially confirmed the news of the agreement reached by the four powers on the Berlin issue this afternoon, the Soviet people breathed a sigh of relief. Moscow Radio broadcast the full text of the agreement twice in a short period, and the general public opinion was that "this is the best news in the world for a long time. We initially thought that Western countries were unwilling to establish an agreement, but now it reveals real hope. We hope that the four powers can reach a broader agreement on Germany at the Foreign Ministers Conference." A taxi driver believed that the agreement was the result of General Clay's departure. Many Russians considered Clay to be the main obstacle to reaching an agreement on the German question.

### All of South Asia Has Felt the Earth Shaking

US Editor Believes It Will Not Become Communist

[United Press, New York, 6th] Isaacs, Deputy Editor of Newsweek, who has traveled in the East and recently returned to the country, published a special report in the magazine entitled "Will South Asia Become Communist?" It stated that before the Communist Chinese army crossed the river, all of South Asia had felt the earth shaking in China. Such shocks often cause panic in distant places. Newspapers in Manila have reported that unidentified vessels have transported Communist troops and armaments to the coast of Luzon. British police in Malaya said that the local Communist rebels are led by special personnel from China. French officials in Vietnam claimed that Communist troops have crossed the border and joined forces with the Viet Minh. Marshal Pibul Songkram of Siam has arrested dozens of overseas Chinese on charges of Communist conspiracy. All this should not cause paranoia or panic. The true facts have their own irresistible force.

### Two Notorious Nazi Generals Exempted from Trial

[Reuters, London, 6th] Undersecretary Henderson declared in the Upper House yesterday that the British government believes that former Hitler's notorious generals Field Marshal Rundstedt and General Strauss are unfit to stand trial due to poor health, and will therefore be released without trial. Another Field Marshal, Manstein, is fit to stand trial and will be prosecuted. The three were captured by British forces after the war and are still in custody. British domestic public opinion has been critical of the long detention of the three men, who are all elderly, without a resolution.

### Gromyko Condemns Britain and the US for Establishing Bases in Spain, Supports Poland's Proposal to Ban Arms

[Our Report] New York, 6th Broadcast: Lake Success Report, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko criticized in the UN Political Committee that Britain and the US are "actively transforming Franco Spain into a military base for war against the Soviet Union." Gromyko supported Poland's proposal, advocating that the United Nations should ban arms and weapons from being shipped to Spain. Gromyko said that Poland pointed out that the United States has built 70 air force bases in Spain and has transported a large amount of military equipment to Spain to equip the country's armed forces, which the United States has not denied. Gromyko further questioned whether the United States and Spain have a secret military agreement.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 5th] The UN Political Committee received a Polish proposal on the 5th, requesting an arms embargo against Franco Spain and freezing the current Spanish government in diplomatic isolation. Polish representative Katz-Suchy declared that the "underground movement" of Latin American countries to abolish the UN resolution to sever diplomatic relations with Spain has now surfaced.

Brazil and other Latin American countries submitted a proposal on the 4th, requesting that UN member states restore diplomatic relations with the Franco regime in Spain. He said that based on this, Poland had to put forward the following suggestions: (1) Request that all UN member states comply with the UN resolutions on the Spanish issue in letter and spirit. (2) Recommend that all member states ban the export of arms and any military supplies or strategic raw materials to Spain. (3) Urge all member states not to conclude any agreements or treaties with Spain. (4) Reiterate that the United Nations is only willing to accept Spain as a member and welcome its participation in special agencies after Spain has rebuilt a democratic government. (5) Instruct the Security Council to constantly monitor Spanish actions. It is speculated that both Poland and Brazil's proposals will inevitably fail.

### Rebel Army in Central Burma Concentrates and Charges Violently Towards Rangoon

Taungoo Area Will Be a Decisive Battlefield

[United Press, Rangoon, 6th] The government announced today that the Karen army launched a counter-offensive against the government forces at Pegu, a transportation hub 57 miles north of Rangoon, with a flanking maneuver from both sides. The government forces resisted with heavy artillery, and the Karen army's communication lines have been cut off, with 200 deaths.

The rebels are now actively digging trenches south of Taungoo, and the government air force is bombing them fiercely. Military observers believe that the outcome of the Battle of Taungoo will determine the fate of the Karen rebellion. The Karen rebels in central Burma have now all been transferred to the Taungoo area, charging violently towards Rangoon, hoping to make a last-ditch effort. Government forces severely damaged the Karen rebels north of Bassein, a rice-producing area southwest of Rangoon. The rebels extensively burned villages in the area. In the southeastern coastal area, the government air force fiercely bombed the rebels concentrated in the Moulmein area.

### It is Rumored that Czechoslovakia Made a Tentative Request to Participate in the Marshall Plan, Indicating a Change in Soviet Foreign Policy

[Agence France-Presse, London, 6th] This "Evening News" stated today that Czechoslovakia has requested to participate in the Marshall Plan. Otta Trate, Chairman of the Czech Central Planning Committee, secretly went to Stockholm to "inquire" to Herschel, the head of the Swedish delegation to the Marshall Plan, about the possibility of Czechoslovakia participating in the Marshall Plan. The newspaper also said that according to well-informed sources, this move by Czechoslovakia was directed by the Kremlin, because the Soviet Union is "no longer able to assist economically unsound satellite countries." The newspaper continued to say that the news came after the lifting of the Berlin Blockade, which may be the most significant shift in Soviet foreign policy since the war.

### Boxing King Performs in the Philippines: Like a Lion Fighting a Rabbit

Two Consecutive Matches Cause the Audience to Laugh

[United Press Manila, 5th] Boxing King Joe Louis gave an exhibition match last night at the Rizal Memorial Stadium here, fighting three rounds each against California boxer Joe Stevens and U.S. Army heavyweight boxing champion Willkin. Joe Louis weighed 215 pounds, and his opponents were far from his match. Therefore, Joe Louis deliberately did not punch with force to avoid knocking out or injuring his opponents. In the first round of the fight between Joe Louis and Stevens, who weighed 205 pounds, Louis kept forcing his opponent to defend. Stevens bravely counterattacked, but to no avail. Joe Louis punished his opponent with a left punch, and then punched Stevens' face and body with both left and right punches, like a rain of fists. Stevens was bleeding from his nose when the match ended. In the second fight, his opponent Willkin weighed only 190 pounds and was slender. Joe Louis stopped attacking Willkin near the end of the first round. Thereafter, Joe Louis fought in a clown-like manner, causing laughter and applause. Joe Louis was once lightly hit in the face and deliberately bent his legs, causing his knees to touch the ground, and then turned his face to smile at the audience, causing the crowd to laugh even more. There were 25,000 spectators last night.

### The British Labour Party

– By G.D.H. Cole, Translated by Song Guihuang

In the early days, the question was often raised: these new figures, only a few of whom had any concept of administrative responsibility in their early lives, did they have the administrative capacity required for government? We must not forget that many, even most, members of the Labour Party had been trained in local government. However, in the early days of the two cabinets in which Labour was a minority party, there were disappointing signs. It was common for an inexperienced cabinet member, surrounded by administrative experts, to forget what his constituents expected of him. Despite these shortcomings, the Labour Party had a democratic tool in its weekly meetings that the old parties did not. Although the Prime Minister and the entire cabinet were ultimately responsible, policy and performance reports were reviewed by the entire party in these meetings, giving every comrade an opportunity to participate in criticism. The Labour Party is far more committed to a unified democratic system than the other two parties. It certainly relies less on the temperament and authority of the party leader. This has been especially true since MacDonald left office in 1931. Although the Labour Party's prestige suffered a temporary loss at the time, it was able to maintain unity and, after the blow of MacDonald's departure, became even more motivated.

Mr. Clarke sees Peel as the typical British Conservative, while my friend Hammond sees Gladstone as the typical Liberal. In my view, Attlee is the most respectable figure in the Labour government. But he belongs to the era of the pioneers. His politics can be compared to Mahatma Gandhi. In terms of loyalty and a sense of justice, Henderson is the epitome. He also embraced a generous international outlook, and after taking over the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he resolutely followed all the resolutions passed by the Labour Party Congress, without exception.

The Theoretical Basis

Finally, I must mention a crucial question: What is the content of the socialism put forward by the Labour Party? It has neither a clearly defined creed nor an orthodox party platform. Various schools of thought, such as the Fabians, Guild Socialists, and Marxists, all have their place in the Labour Party. Morris, Carpenter, and Hobson created theories for the Labour Party in the past thirty years. Tawney, Cole, and Laski are creating theories for it in this era. It accepts the public heritage that our ancestors fought for and won for us, namely the traditions of civil liberties and freedom of speech. What it rejects is the laissez-faireism, profit motive, and belief in free enterprise of the nineteenth century. It is easier to describe its goals than to describe its doctrines. (To be continued)

### The Leader of the Broadsword Gang Finally Reaps the Bitter Fruit: Little Changgen Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday; Two Volunteer Police Officers in Yangjing District Executed for Conspiracy

[Reported by this Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Police Department executed Xu Shouhuai, the leader of the Broadsword Gang in this city, at Lao Beimen at 10:00 AM yesterday. Xu, a native of Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, was 29 years old, nicknamed Little Changgen. He was known for his rampant behavior in Shanghai, extorting, looting, and killing. The cases reported by victimized merchants numbered in the dozens. He was extremely wicked and feared by the people like a tiger, hence the nickname "Unkillable Changgen." The major crimes he committed included the theft and sale of military rice from the United Logistics Headquarters in November 1948, the gathering of crowds for armed fights and the robbery of police officers' pistols in the South City on February 3 of this year, and the gathering of crowds for brawls in the Deyilou restaurant in the City God Temple on February 22. In addition, he frequently incited his followers to force sales to fruit and dry goods stores in the Shiliupu area, and recently colluded with bandits to plot riots. He was arrested recently and confessed to all charges during interrogation. The Police Department, considering that the suspect dared to violate martial law during this period of martial law, was undoubtedly guilty of unforgivable crimes. With the approval of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, he was executed by firing squad, with Wu Futang, the chief of the Criminal Division of the Police Department, supervising the execution.

[Reported by this Newspaper] At 4:00 PM yesterday, the Police Department also executed two "defection specialists" dispatched by the Communist Party's Agile Column, Zhang Meifang (21 years old, Shanghai native) and Pan Hualong (24 years old, Shanghai native), volunteer police officers in the Yangjing District, at the Song Park Road execution ground. The execution was supervised by the newly appointed Chief Inspector Du Chun. After the two criminals were arrested, they confessed to having been "ordered" to come to Shanghai to plan the incitement of all volunteer police officers to prepare for the Communist army's attack on Shanghai.

Cotton cloth off-exchange bids continue to trend firm. There are frequent orders from South China. Longtou fine cloth and Four Gentlemen drill have risen once, and high prices have been transacted, but then they seem to be bid up. Longtou fine cloth is trending firm and bullish, with many transactions. Actual sales in the market are still extremely sluggish. The prices of cloth stalls on North Hai Road are particularly low. The factory prices of private cloth factories mostly remain unchanged.

### Gold Initially Firm Then Weak: Silver Shops Plan to List Prices Next Week

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday's gold market situation was initially firm and then weak. In the morning, a large number of Central Bank fixed-amount promissory notes flowed out, cash positions were ample, and certified checks were allowed to be used, so the turnover was flexible, and there were many people absorbing at low prices. The market went up, but large investors were very few and the market stomach was not large. Off-exchange opened at 200 million, 230 million, once as high as 230 million, 260 million, and as low as 180 million, 210 million. The noon close was 210 million, 240 million. In the afternoon, due to unfavorable external environment, market sentiment was weak, and the market stepped down from 190 million, 220 million to 170 million, 200 million, still down 10 million compared to the previous day's close.

Off-exchange U.S. dollars fluctuated along with gold prices. Off-exchange opened at 4 million, 4.5 million, once as high as 4.5 million, 5 million, and as low as 3.8 million, 4.3 million. The noon close was 4.2 million, 4.7 million. In the afternoon, supply exceeded demand, and from 3.8 million, 4.3 million, it went straight down to 3.5 million, 4 million, also down 200,000.

Also Reported: Yesterday's exchange ratio of U.S. dollars to gold was 49, 51. The ratio to Big Head silver dollars was 6 yuan 8 jiao, 7 yuan 3 jiao per ten yuan.

Also Reported: General silver dollar shops, gold decorations, and Big Head silver dollars were trading at 36, 39, with many transactions.

Also Reported: According to Wu Pengnian, the chairman of the Silver Shop Association, the silver shop industry can resume listing prices and start trading from next week, as promissory notes have gradually become clearer in recent days.

### More Silver Dollars In Than Out

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday's silver dollar market situation was that general licensed shops still listed 4 million to buy in, but only buying in and not selling out. Several shops listed 3.7 million to buy in and 4 million to sell out, but they were all cage ocean dollars. Big Head and Little Head silver dollars were rarely seen. Although the price of the horse-drawn silver bull exceeded, its whereabouts were extremely secret, and transactions were mostly led to buildings or alleys. Near noon, the yellow bull market also became rare, but in reality there was a black market, exceeding the official price of 4 million yuan.

Also Reported: The nickel coin market on the street was active, and the market situation was rising. 20-cent coins were bought in at 150,000 and sold out at 200,000. 10-cent coins were bought in at 70,000 and sold out at 100,000. 5-cent transactions were rare, with bids at 40,000, 70,000, an increase of 30,000 compared to the previous day.

Also Reported: The market price for the exchange of gold and Big Head silver dollars still divides factory bars and shop bars. Factory bars opened in the morning at 37, 39, down to 36, 38, and closed at noon at 36.5 yuan, 38.5 yuan. In the afternoon, they rose to 38, 40. Shop bars opened in the morning at 34, 36, closed at noon at 35, 37, and rose to 37, 39 in the afternoon.

### Cash Chips Loosening

Cash yesterday saw general loosening. Those holding bank and merchant house wooden notes could request cash redemption from the respective banks and merchant houses. Therefore, premium charges were rare. Furthermore, banks and merchant houses, for clients with overnight positions, also fully paid out cash according to the Central Bank's methods. However, it was heard that due to holders of fixed-amount promissory notes rushing to exchange them for cash, a market offering 90% value was still observed.

Yesterday, the Central Bank continued to allow banks and merchant houses to fully redeem discounts based on their overnight balances. The proportion of domestic shipping currency, cash, and fixed-amount promissory notes remained the same as before. According to authoritative sources at the Central Bank, the cash shortage should be completely eliminated within three days.

Fifty-thousand yuan notes officially appeared yesterday. The Central Printing Plant delivered a large batch to the Central Bank the day before yesterday. Yesterday, most of the allocation received by banks and merchant houses consisted of fifty-thousand yuan notes. It is expected that the cash shortage will be resolved within days.

### Those Residing for a Long Time Without Identity Cards: Authorities Plan Remedial Measures; Can Apply for Temporary Identity Cards

Since the Garrison Headquarters decided to disperse the city's population to meet wartime needs, stipulating that anyone found without a Shanghai National Identity Card would be sent out of the city, the Municipal Government, considering that some residents of the city have indeed resided in the city for some time, and have normal occupations and must remain in Shanghai, but have not obtained identity cards due to various reasons or temporary negligence, should have remedial measures. Therefore, it has consulted with the Garrison Department and decided to issue a type of temporary identity card for proof. The detailed measures and application forms are currently being drafted by the Police Bureau in conjunction with the Social Bureau and the Civil Affairs Bureau. Once drafted, they will be submitted to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for approval before implementation. It is understood that applicants for this temporary identity card must provide strong evidence that they have resided in the city for a long time, as well as a guarantee from the person in charge of the service organization or store, fill out an application form, and be thoroughly reviewed by the competent authorities and personally approved by the heads of the Police, Social, and Civil Affairs Bureaus. The application will then be submitted to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for investigation and approval before it can be issued.

### Vendors Transporting Firewood and Grain: Police Department Permits Entry; However, Supporting Documents Should be Provided

[Central News Agency] In view of the fact that the daily supply of firewood, vegetables, and grain for the military and civilians in the Shanghai urban area and the suburban military units relies on transportation from outside the area, and that it has recently been reported that garrison troops along the way, due to unclear procedures, sometimes do not allow passage, resulting in a gradual shortage of supplies, the Songhu Garrison Department, in order to ensure that the supply of its jurisdiction is not endangered, in addition to detailing the restrictions on the entry of materials for separate announcement, has specially stipulated that vendors from areas outside the jurisdiction transporting firewood, vegetables, and grain into the area, if they have identity cards and supporting documents from government agencies and township offices, will be allowed to pass after inspection and should not be obstructed. It is reported that the department has instructed all subordinate units to strictly comply with these regulations.

### Gunshots on Ningbo Road: A Petty Thief Injured in the Leg

[Our Newspaper] Huangpu Branch police officers No. 5506 and 26572, at around 11:00 AM yesterday, were patrolling near the Fuchang Money Exchange on Ningbo Road when they found Sun Yimin and two others acting suspiciously. After the police set up a search, they went forward to intercept them and ordered them to show their identity cards. Sun actually had a dispute with the police officers. The police fired a shot, hitting Sun's right leg, and he fell to the ground. Pedestrians suddenly heard the gunshot and fled in all directions. The other two took the opportunity to escape. Afterwards, the police took Sun to the police hospital for treatment. It was later learned that the injured person, Sun Yimin, a native of Jiangsu, 26 years old, was a petty thief residing at No. 6, Lane 62, Anren Street. It was also said that the police officer who fired the shot was also injured in the hand.

### Old Man Accidentally Injures His Wife: Court Grants Bail

[Our Newspaper] Yang Jinsheng, a native of Nanjing, residing at No. 45, Zhongyi Lane, Saposai Road in this city, works as a lane watchman. He is now 73 years old, and his wife, Yu, is 69 years old. They have been married for 52 years and have two sons and one daughter, all of whom are grown adults. Three years ago, Yang suddenly suffered from mental illness, which came and went. On the night of the 12th of last month, Yang suddenly held a kitchen knife and stabbed his wife Yu in the neck. After being discovered, Yu was rushed to the hospital for treatment. The hospital reported the incident to the police. The District Prosecutor's Office detained Yang and filed a public prosecution for attempted murder. The case was heard in the Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday. The white-haired couple faced each other in court. Yu stated that her husband did not intend to kill her, but that he had accidentally injured her due to a temporary mental illness. She requested that he be exempted from prosecution and released. The defendant also vehemently denied the murder. The court considered the circumstances and granted bail, announcing that the verdict would be delivered on the 10th of this month. Old Yang was frail and walked with difficulty, and was supported by his grandson as he left.

### Public Utility Index Exceeds General Prices: Municipal Council Subcommittee to Meet Today to Discuss Countermeasures; Vice-Chairman Expresses Belief that a Solution Will Be Found

[Central News Agency] Recently, with the public utility pricing index rising repeatedly, citizens feel increasingly unable to bear the burden and have appealed to the Municipal Council for rectification. The council has scheduled a meeting of the Public Utilities Subcommittee for 3:00 PM this afternoon to discuss the matter, and has invited councilors who are not members of the subcommittee to attend as well.

It is also learned that Zhou Xuexiang, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, believes that the wages earned by workers throughout the city are only 370,000 times, while the public utility index announced on the 5th has risen to 950,000 times, making it unbearable for ordinary workers and affecting public life, and that there is a risk of collapse for industrial and commercial businesses. Yesterday, he sent a letter to the Municipal Council suggesting that it be stopped immediately. Wang Qiyu, Chairman of the Textile Industry Association of the Six Districts, also stated that the public utility index exceeds general prices. The industry uses the most electricity. If alternative measures are not promptly considered, factories throughout the city will quickly collapse, and the consequences will be disastrous. He specifically sent a letter to the Municipal Council explaining his views.

[Our Newspaper] Since all sectors of the city unanimously requested the correction of the public utility index, which has been rising crazily, this reporter specially sought the opinion of Mr. Xu Jigu, Vice-Chairman of the Municipal Council, yesterday. Mr. Xu also stated that the index is indeed too high, but the Municipal Council's Public Utilities Subcommittee is scheduled to meet at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 7th, and he will also attend at that time. He believes that the committee will definitely find a solution to this problem. Therefore, before the subcommittee reaches a resolution, he is unwilling to comment much on the matter.

A Reader's Letter Points Out Several Extremely Unreasonable Points

A reader, Chen Zhi, wrote to this newspaper stating: After the daily adjustment of fees for public utilities based on the price index, the companies are indeed making profits every day, which is ten thousand times better than the previous so-called Guan Yuan pricing, so they no longer need to pretend to be poor and complain. What is suffering are still us, the users. The writer believes that there are several extremely unreasonable points in this method of pricing based on the price index, and requests that the municipal authorities urge the public utility companies to make improvements: (1) Daily adjustment of fees according to the price index is certainly the most profitable method for the companies, but the first unreasonable point is, for example, on the first day of implementing the price index-based fee collection, the index was 140,000 times, and the index on the day before yesterday had risen to 950,000 times. If it rises to who knows how many times in a month, and after paying for a full month, based on the bill, the fee is paid according to the index on the payment date, assuming that the index on the payment date is 20 million times, may I ask, is it reasonable to pay for the water and electricity used when the index was 140,000 times at a price of 20 million times? If the companies believe that the price increase is too large and it is necessary to implement price index pricing, then they should read the meter and collect fees every day, which is the correct thing to do. If they believe that reading the meter and collecting fees every day is troublesome, that is the responsibility of the company. They want to obtain this undue profit, so they force users to delay paying once. Users have the right to refuse this extra burden. This method of enriching a few at the expense of the many is absolutely unreasonable and should be completely abolished, and a proper fee collection method should be established. (2) Shanghai has many lanes, and most lanes only have one water meter. The water bill is distributed to the households. If there are twenty or thirty households in a lane, it is impossible to collect all the money in one day. Even if it is collected in one day, the index will have adjusted the price the next day. May I ask how to distribute and collect the money? As a result, disputes arise repeatedly, and complaints are everywhere. The authorities should also set a standard payment period for these public users in order to be reasonable. (3) There are still doubts as to whether the accounts of the various companies are accurate. It is said that the French Concession Water and Electricity Company employs sixty foreigners, whose salaries can抵到抵到三千個中國工人, and this abnormal phenomenon should be thoroughly investigated by the municipal authorities. Whether the accounts of the various companies have been falsely reported or inflated should also be strictly audited.

### Public Utility Index Drops for Two Days, Today at 830,000 Times

According to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, the current public utility meter index is "830,000 times". It is found that the public utility index has been rising sharply in recent days, and has only fallen twice in a row yesterday and today.

### A Comprehensive Discussion on the American Democratic Party (Part 1)

— Written by Arthur M. Schlesinger, Translated by Song Guihuang

Although the American Republican Party is known as the "Grand Old Party," it is actually only reaching the vigorous middle age of ninety-four. The Democratic Party, on the other hand, has reached the age of one hundred and fifty-six, and is clearly the oldest political party in the United States that has been active without interruption, almost the same age as the United States. As early as in Washington's cabinet, when Jefferson and Hamilton were engaged in fierce struggles, the life of the Democratic Party had already begun. Although Hamilton's Federalist Party later reincarnated repeatedly under the names of the Whig Party and the Republican Party, it only lived for thirty years. Only the life of Jefferson's party has never been interrupted. Although this party is weak and sickly, it possesses a vitality that allows it to survive to this day, although it has experienced wars, recessions, political failures, and even political victories.

It is undeniable that the Democratic Party has recently been in power for sixteen years, but its internal divisions are very serious. When the national congress was held in 1948, it almost fell apart; because of the election campaign, it aroused all kinds of fierce trends of mutual attacks and slander within the party. For example, New York Mayor O'Dwyer and Mississippi's John Rankin, as well as Huntley and Bulwinkle, had little in common between them except that they did not support Truman's nomination. Those in the United States who support the Democratic Party and organized workers usually support the Democratic Party, but the most enthusiastic schemers and labor abusers also support the Democratic Party.

Even in terms of foreign policy, although the majority of Democrats are internationalists, no one can ignore the poisonous isolationists such as Wheeler and O'Daniel. Even Franklin D. Roosevelt, who possessed political genius, found it difficult to bring these people together. Now, the Democratic Party is almost fragmented. Some party members followed Wallace and the pro-Communist faction onto the old path of the Progressive Party, while others followed the unrepentant traitors of South Carolina Governor Thurmond and his ilk. The remaining members, consisting of Southern moderates, New Dealers, big business tycoons, and simple democrats, are temporarily and reluctantly united to take joint action. Does this extraordinary political alliance have any real meaning?

Madison of Virginia is the father of the American Constitution. He once famously said: "The most common and durable source of factions has always been the various and unequal distribution of property." He also said: "The regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal task of modern Legislation, and involves the spirit of party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the Government."

What were the class interests in Madison's time? Some people were centered around industry and commerce, that is, the bourgeoisie and creditors, commercial capitalists and financial capitalists. These people intended to control Hamilton's party, and because of the rise of Hamilton's Federalist Party, the remaining members in Madison's ranks - that is, landowners, debtors, and the proletariat - were in an opposing position. Thus, Jefferson's party arose to speak for the non-industrial and commercial members. Since then, the Democratic Party has always adhered to this task and has not changed its attitude.

Indeed, in the 1860s, the Democratic Party lost a lot of support from the people of the North because the slaveholders were in power in the party; and afterwards, it permanently failed to regain the support of the Northern farmers, except occasionally in the short term, when the Northern farmers had to support Bryan and Franklin D. Roosevelt because of low grain prices. But since the Civil War, the Democratic Party has gradually restored its old model, that is, a mixed union of Southern conservative farmers, Northern liberals, organized workers, and industrial and commercial leaders in the cities.

Jefferson and Hamilton, when Washington was president, one served as Secretary of State and the other as Secretary of the Treasury. Jefferson said that these two people were "like two cocks in a coop," but the rivalry between the two was not merely a personal struggle. Hamilton intended to establish a strong central government, whose tax policies would win the support of industry and commerce. He felt that the capitalists must be won over, and he did not trust the common people. He once said at the Constitutional Convention: "The common people are turbulent and changing, and their judgments and decisions are rarely correct."

But Jefferson sympathized with the Southern farmers, fearing that a centralized government would allow capitalists to exploit the farmers. He advocated limiting the power of the federal government and safeguarding the rights of the states. He also proposed that the people are the ultimate reservoir of power and the ultimate judge of administrators. Jefferson felt uneasy from this point of view. On May 13, 1793, when Washington's second term had not yet lasted long, Jefferson wrote a reproachful letter to the president, in which he first proposed the name of his party. He said: "The Republicans who want to maintain the existing government system are fewer in number than the monarchist Federalists."

Today's Democratic Party, which was called the Republican Party at that time for thirty years, is smaller in number, but its members are willing to continue to fight. He still regards Jefferson as a great political leader because he has an unparalleled understanding of the value and goals of democracy. Jefferson's principles, as Lincoln later said, are "the definition and principle of a free society." He not only possessed great philosophy, but also extraordinary talent, and was an energetic politician. Even before writing the letter to Washington, he had personally visited New York to promote the unity of Southern agriculturalists and Northern industrial and commercial leaders. For example, Burr, the leader of the Tammany Hall, later became a powerful Jeffersonian. Jefferson's theory is already commonplace to us today.

In the election of 1800, because Jefferson was well prepared, the Republican Party (that is, the Democratic Party) seized power. When this hated Virginian took office as president, the Federalists only trembled. In New England, women even hid their ornaments for fear that the new government would confiscate them. Theodore Dwight, a Federalist from Connecticut, declared that the country was ruled by wicked people and fools. He cried out like a madman: "Wives and husbands, and all their happiness, are in ruins; our wives and daughters are reduced to concubines; our children are orphaned. Is there any situation that our imaginations can paint, so dreadful, as this side of hell?"

But since taking office as president, Jefferson has shown an attitude of reconciliation from the beginning. In his inaugural address, he said, "We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists." Once he seized power, his claim to fight for the rights of the states and strictly abide by the Constitution was withdrawn. He indicated that the Constitution could be accommodated when necessary, such as the purchase of Louisiana. In other words, fighting for state rights was a secondary issue for Jefferson, while the most important thing was his desire to achieve the basic goals of the country. Many Federalists changed their allegiance to the Republican Party because of the moderation of Jefferson's policies, such as John Adams. By 1820, the Federalist Party had perished.

After Jackson took office as president in 1829, the history of the party entered a new stage. Jackson was a powerful and decisive leader who did not fear anyone and was convinced of his policies. As a result, he changed the entire nature of the presidency. His reputation is active in history. On the day he took office, the masses poured into the White House to receive his hospitality, but his contributions were more real. His strengthening of the power of the chief executive set a precedent for later presidents, which has been followed to this day.

### Beryllium—A Substitute for Steel

— Pei Jun

As early as 1827, people discovered that beryllium was an element. It was not until more than twenty years ago that metallurgists began to experiment with it. It is mostly produced in the Western Hemisphere, and the United States is currently the most prosperous. It is distributed from Maine to Georgia, and in places such as North Dakota, Oklahoma, Nevada, California, New Mexico, and Arizona.

We usually think that metals will gradually lose their effectiveness under pressure. In the industrial world, this problem is very serious. Now, various machines have to work at high speeds, so the entire factory wheels may have to stop. Therefore, we should quickly use a metal that can maintain its original properties under constantly increasing pressure in every important place to make springs and complex parts of machines. In fact, "beryllium copper" is exactly what is needed.

Beryllium has the properties of metal, is one-third lighter than aluminum, but is harder than steel. However, although it is hard under a certain pressure, it is very brittle and will break when dropped on the ground. After research by many metallurgical experts, a mysterious discovery was finally made. Adding 2% to beryllium copper and heating it can harden the copper, just like the hardening of steel. Later, the tensile strength of their alloy was tested, and it only stopped rising when it reached 185,000 pounds per inch. In other words, a beryllium copper rod with a diameter of half an inch can lift something weighing twenty tons.

In addition to its tensile strength, beryllium copper also has other useful properties. Workers in oil refineries and munitions factories use hammers, chisels, and shovels made of beryllium copper, which will not produce sparks like iron, thereby causing accidental combustion.

The steel buckles on parachutes often cause the magnetic compasses on airplanes to deflect, so beryllium copper is now used instead. Machines that must work in humid areas or near salt or other corrosive chemicals are also often made of beryllium copper, because it does not rust or corrode.

In fact, all new aviation machinery, including the most sophisticated drivers, contain beryllium copper - which makes them very accurate even in the worst environments. The new altimeter relies entirely on a moving rust plate, and it knows as soon as the air pressure changes, and it is durable. Modern transport planes and bombers have more than a hundred parts made of beryllium, and they will never lose efficiency due to long use.

Hospitals, laboratories, factories, power plants, and the linings of ships all use springs and diaphragms that are similar to those used in aviation. Automobiles and electric trams are also starting to use beryllium - wherever high speed or very strenuous work is required, it is used.

X-rays can pass through pure beryllium, so it is used as a window on X-ray tubes. Doctors use it as a target on their atomic analysis machines.

Beryllium oxide has important uses. Fluorescent lamps - which are the most similar to sunlight artificially - are coated with beryllium oxide. The magical screen of the newly invented radio transmission technology is also coated with beryllium oxide. The magical screen of the newly invented radio film art is also coated with beryllium oxide.

The term beryllium may be unfamiliar to some people. But we often have the opportunity to use it: it can make us comfortable, safe, and save money. Because with beryllium, steel can be replaced. At the same time, the parts can be used four or five times longer.

### Imminent Lifting of the Berlin Blockade; Airlift Operations Not Intended for Interruption

[British News Agency, London, 6th] The Four Powers issued a joint communique on the 5th regarding the lifting of restrictions on commercial traffic within Germany and the convening of a Foreign Ministers' Conference in Paris:

The Governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union have reached the following agreement:

(1) All restrictions imposed by the Soviet Government since March 1, 1948, on traffic, transportation, and trade between Berlin and West Germany, and between the eastern and western zones, will be lifted on May 12, 1949.

(2) All restrictions imposed by the Governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, or any one of them, since March 1, 1948, on traffic, transportation, and trade between Berlin and the western zones, and between West Germany and East Germany, will also be lifted on May 12, 1949.

(3) Eleven days after the lifting of the aforementioned restrictions, that is, on May 23, 1949, a Foreign Ministers' Conference will be convened in Paris to discuss the German problem and the problems arising from the Berlin situation, including the Berlin currency issue.

When Foreign Secretary Bevin read the above communique in the House of Commons on the 6th, he announced that he would travel to Berlin on the 7th to inspect the airlift operations, and at the same time convey the British government's gratitude and congratulations to all meritorious personnel. Referring to the lifting of the blockade, Bevin said: "The British government welcomes the conclusion of the aforementioned agreement. The House may understand that the breakdown of the Four Powers' discussions on the German problem was not our responsibility, as we have always been willing to consult with other occupying powers on the German problem. However, discussions could not proceed while the blockade continued, but now the blockade is about to be lifted." Bevin then pointed out that the firm and reasonable policy pursued by the British government has now been militarily vindicated. When dealing with new issues at the upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference, the British government will adhere to the same firm and reasonable spirit as in the past, which can be guaranteed. The Foreign Secretary finally stated that the Berlin airlift will not be interrupted until the situation is completely clarified.

A British Overseas Airways Corporation "Short Solent," the latest model seaplane, landed on the Thames River in the form of a swan plunging into a waterfall on the morning of the [date missing] to celebrate the 30th anniversary of British commercial aviation. This is the first time in 21 years that Londoners have seen a seaplane on the river. Sir Irving, the Lord Mayor of London, will name the plane "City of London" next week. In August 1928, another Short seaplane, the "Calcutta," landed between Vauxhall and Lambeth Bridges, but it was much smaller compared to this aircraft.

British Overseas Airways Corporation now uses Constellation aircraft on the London-Sydney route, a distance of 12,000 miles, and the flight time has been reduced to less than four days.

Due to the lifting of night flight restrictions in Egypt, British Overseas Airways Corporation has been able to change its flight schedule. When flying from London to Sydney, there is an overnight stop in Cairo and a three-and-a-half-hour stop in Karachi. Previously, there was an overnight stop in Rome and a 17-hour stop in Karachi. The other overnight stop remains Singapore.

When flying from Sydney back to London, there is a brief stop in Cairo before flying to Rome for an overnight stay.

Many British manufacturers and leading industrialists are part of the Hong Kong trade delegation to the exhibition. Colonial Under-Secretary Rees-Williams gave a speech praising Hong Kong's post-war recovery. He said that the British government has allocated £1 million for Hong Kong's construction, half for the development of fisheries and agriculture, and the other half for urban construction. According to someone who recently returned from Hong Kong, he was deeply impressed by the implementation of Hong Kong's fisheries plan. He also praised the medical services. He pointed out that there were only 3,000 students in Hong Kong at the time of liberation. By the end of 1946, the number of students had exceeded the pre-occupation figure. In addition, Hong Kong's commercial figures have also broken all records. In 1948, the total value of import and export trade reached £230 million. Hong Kong can be called an oasis of peace and prosperity in a turbulent world, and the British are determined to maintain this position of Hong Kong.

### Reader Inquiries, Legal Interpretations, Good Things Take Time: "Incurable" Disease Hinders Auspicious Date, Answered by Lawyer Tang Mingshi

Cai Wenbin asks: My son was engaged to a certain lady through a matchmaker last August, and a wedding banquet was scheduled for this spring. Unexpectedly, the lady contracted a lung disease after the engagement, and the other party demanded that all medical expenses be borne by our side, which we did not agree to. The other party now intends to sell all the jewelry from our side to cover medical expenses. May I ask what should be done if the other party disregards everything and sells the jewelry?

[Answer] In law, there is indeed a provision for divorce in the case of incurable diseases (termination of the contract is even more permissible), but the so-called incurable disease must be confirmed through a "prohibition of disposal of property" procedure and cannot be determined solely based on a doctor's certificate. According to the development of modern medicine, lung disease is not necessarily incurable. This point, if litigated, will definitely be disputed by both parties.

As for the expenses for the woman's medical treatment after the engagement, unless she is a daughter-in-law being raised in the family, it seems that the man cannot be forced to bear them. This refers to the old-fashioned family. If it is a new-style of freedom, even friends should have a sense of mutual assistance, and an unmarried fiancé should be even more so.

Once engagement gifts are delivered, their ownership seems to have been transferred. Even if the contract is terminated and compensation can be demanded, it does not necessarily have to be the original object. Therefore, if the other party disposes of it, it cannot constitute grounds for prosecution.

### Triangular Fountain Pen Invented in South Wales, UK

[British News Agency, London, 20th] A fountain pen factory in South Wales, UK, recently invented a fountain pen that can write in three colors of ink. The pen is equipped with three nibs. If you want to write in red, green, or blue ink, you don't need to change the nibs. When not in use, the nibs can be pushed into the pen barrel, so they won't break clothes when placed in a pocket.

### Japanese Palace Secrets: Palace Maidens' Symposium Hosted by "Truth Society"

Sexually Perverted Old Palace Maids

This Newspaper: When we think of palace maids, we really want to know a little.

A: Palace maids are divided into five classes. The highest is equivalent to a senior civil servant, followed by recommended, appointed, employee, and maid. When I was in the palace, there were more than 100 maids alone. The dormitory was at the foot of Hongye Mountain.

B: Yes, but men are prohibited from entering and exiting. However, male teachers sent by kimono shops to teach embroidery and decoration can still enter and exit.

C: When a palace maid is promoted to senior rank, she has seven maids to serve her. Even with their serving maids, they have to distinguish the ranks for every stroke.

D: The palace rules do not allow palace maids to marry. The only men they can approach in the palace are the adjutant officers, who are young and burly. The palace maids secretly fall in love with them, especially the high-ranking middle-aged palace maids, who love to chat with them all day long. "Can I be your dear mother?" They are so nauseatingly in love with the adjutant officers. Sometimes, when they don't have money, they even sell their own hats to give the money to them for use. (Bitter smile)

E: I know that some adjutant officers also hate these middle-aged palace maids and often avoid them to avoid being nagged. (Laughter)

For a short period, almost every night was like this. When we were about to sleep, the palace maid would call and say she had something she wanted me to do. I had to bite the bullet and walk down that gloomy corridor. Fortunately, a "guardsman" soldier with a gun was added to the corridor in a few days, otherwise I would have been so scared that I would have gotten sick. Whenever I turned the corner and walked into the palace maid's bedroom, she always tried to put together something for me to do, taking the opportunity to chat with me. Once, we talked about the gas not being able to be turned off. As a result, I turned it off with a slight push. (Laughter) I said I had to go, but she insisted on holding you back, with a pair of bewitching eyes, it was really hideous. (Laughter)

B: Old palace maids in their forties and fifties still dress up in gaudy and strange ways, like the old women from the Matsumoto, Matsuo, and Sando groups.

C: The old woman Matsumoto, who wears glasses, is an old monster. She was promoted from a midwife to a recommended palace maid and is a famous "hysteric" in the palace.

D: Almost all the old palace maids have a bit of sexual perversion. Matsuo often wanted me to talk to her in her room. As long as Sando coughed outside the door, Matsuo would angrily go out the back door. As soon as the old glutton Sando came in, she would ask me all sorts of questions about how I was talking to Matsuo and what we were talking about. It was really annoying, but I couldn't get angry. (Laughter)

B: The young lower-ranking palace maids are also unable to properly solve their sexual problems, so they are all mentally depressed and pale. It's really pitiful. (Sigh)

Hirohito Studies Microbiology

This Newspaper: What is the emperor's life like during his time at the detached palace?

B: Miss C has more opportunities to go hunting with the "Emperor," please speak first. (Applause)

C: I have been to Hayama and Nasu with him. Local government officials and people have to come to pay their respects. Afterwards, the "Emperor" leads a dozen armed adjutant officers to the mountains to find mossy stones or to the beach to collect shells.

This Newspaper: Does the "Emperor" do it himself?

B: The attendants do it, he just points and gestures at this and that. (Laugh)

This Newspaper: What is Miss C's job at that time?

C: At that time, I was in charge of delivering the "Emperor's" meal (as well as dairy products and black tea) to the mountains or the beach. The plate of white rice had to be held above the eyes and carried for two or three miles. I always felt that this "imperial rule" was too cruel.

This Newspaper: If you carry the meal for two or three miles, won't dust get in?

C: There are lids covering them. The most hateful thing is that the things I send have to be held eight points high above my eyes, and I have to hang a teapot full of black tea on my wrist. Carrying it like this for two or three miles is so tiring that I can barely support myself. (Astonishment)

This Newspaper: What does the "Emperor" do in Hayama?

D: Go to Hayama Bay, take a motorboat and wander around. Sometimes he picks up shells on the rocky beach. It is said that there are no rare shells in Hayama, but the "Emperor" likes Hayama. (Laughter)

This Newspaper: It is said that the "Emperor" is very fond of collecting microbial materials, is that right?

D: Yes, when going to Hayama, the attendants always carry the "Imperial Microbial Material Collection Box."

This Newspaper: Are the microbial materials found taken back to the laboratory for research?

E: A "Imperial Microbial Special Research Institute" has been specially set up in Hayama. It is said that the equipment is extremely complete. An elderly eye doctor is often in charge of researching the "Emperor's microbiology" there. The Emperor sometimes goes to the laboratory to "research" during the time between his afternoon exercise and dinner. As for how much he can research, I am a layman. In short, although the "Emperor" who enters the laboratory poses as a scholar, the adjutant officers often say behind his back that he has a big head and is flustered. (Laughter)
