###  Stay in Beiping for Five Days, Met with Ye Jianying and Others Several Times.  The Beijing Delegation Returns to the Capital.  The CCP's Attitude and Conditions for Peace Talks are Now Known.  Today's Audience with Acting President Li to Report on the Process.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] The Beijing People's Peace Delegation, including Qiu Zhizhong, Wu Yuhao, and Hui Zisheng, went to Beiping to meet with CCP leaders in Beiping, including Ye Jianying, Lin Biao, and Nie Rongzhen, to exchange views on peace issues. They stayed in Beiping for five days and flew back to Beijing from Beiping by special plane at 5:00 PM on the 11th. Qiu, Wu, and others visited Ye Jianying, Lin Biao, Nie Rongzhen, and others several times in Beiping to inquire about the CCP's opinions on the peace issue and the techniques for conducting peace talks. At the same time, in the capacity of a third party, they conveyed to the current government their willingness for peace and the preparations for peace talks. They have now collected some information and have learned the CCP's attitude towards peace talks and the conditions that the CCP requires the government to earnestly implement. They are scheduled to pay a visit to Acting President Li on the 12th to report and convey the CCP's opinions to the government. After obtaining the government's response, it is hoped that the content will be published. According to a representative of the delegation, the result of their meeting with Ye, Lin, and others was that Ye, Lin, and others all expressed that the CCP is also willing to have peace, but it needs to go through some preparation. At least it must be after the complete liberation of Beiping. As to when Beiping will be considered completely liberated, Beiping is currently engaged in a household registration survey to ensure safety. Although there is no clear explanation of the definition of complete liberation, it is estimated that it can be completed within a month in terms of time. At that time, the CCP can be expected to send representatives to conduct peace talks. Although CCP leaders such as Ye and Lin have slightly different views on President Chiang and Acting President Li individually, there is not much difference. They still hold a cautious wait-and-see attitude towards Acting President Li's sincerity for peace, hoping that the person in charge of the peace talks can represent the entire government and have sufficient control. The delegation had planned to visit Fu Zuoyi on the 11th, but because they hurriedly returned to Beijing on the 11th, they did not have time to meet with Fu. The delegation's activities in Beiping were still relatively free, but for the sake of prudence, the CCP and the delegation agreed not to receive any Chinese or foreign reporters who visited. In addition, the six reporters who accompanied the delegation to Beiping were not allowed by the CCP to enter the city after arriving at the Xiyuan Airport. They stayed in the airport for five days and returned to Beijing on the original plane with the delegation on the 11th.

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 11th Broadcast: When the Shaanbei CCP radio station broadcasted today, it also publicly mentioned the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation, including Qiu Zhizhong and others, negotiating peace in Beiping, and said that the mission had been "successfully completed." It also stated: Before the delegation left, it would publish a written conversation on the negotiation process, expressing gratitude for the warm reception of General Ye Jianying and the CCP authorities in Beiping. The broadcast pointed out that the Nanjing delegation had met with General Ye Jianying and others twice. The second conversation lasted more than four hours. It also said that Ye Jianying had promised to convey the delegation's opinions to the CCP Central Committee.

[United Press Nanjing, 11th] The Beijing People's Peace Delegation flew back here on the 11th, and the meeting with the CCP leaders in Beiping ended, "quite encouraging." It is revealed that progress has been made on the Communist side's request for reorganizing the army and punishing war criminals. Fu Zuoyi was not arrested.

[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai Peace Delegation's trip to Beiping has been full of twists and turns. Gan Jiehou received a long-distance call from Beiping again at 12:00 midnight the day before yesterday, asking him to inform the delegation to postpone the flight to Beiping to the 13th. Gan then informed Yan Huiqing and other members of the delegation at 8:00 AM yesterday, and the trip to Beiping yesterday was cancelled again. According to the observation of qualified people, it is believed that the recent international situation has changed, and the US Tokyo meeting decided to aid China. The formation of a domestic peace negotiation situation is far less optimistic than expected. Under this atmosphere, the repeated postponement of the delegation's flight to Beiping is a matter of course. Even if Yan Huiqing and others cannot make the trip tomorrow, it is not surprising.

### Acting President Li and President Sun Have a Consistent Opinion on the Overall Situation

[United Press Guangzhou, 11th] Senior government officials stated on the 11th: Acting President Li and other senior officials have reached a consensus with President Sun, that is, if the CCP does not want peace and does not start negotiations to end the civil war soon, the only way to follow will be to prepare for the final decisive battle. The official also stated: Acting President Li is expected to come to Guangzhou soon, because the hope of peace has collapsed. Acting President Li's coming to Guangzhou is to cooperate with President Sun and the cabinet to start the final preparations. However, President Li is expected to stay in Nanjing for some time as a sign that the government is willing to negotiate. At the same time, the government will rush to prepare for the Communist army's spring offensive across the Yangtze River, and hope that this action may soften the Communist side's conditions. The official also stated: US aid with extensive supervision rights may be obtained again, and this US aid will include military and economic aid. The government is already working on a tax reform plan as the basis for making this request. The government's main efforts will focus on the unity of South China to prevent partial peace settlements such as Beiping. Also, Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, and Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan, will go to Shanghai on the 11th to persuade the members of the two houses to come to Guangzhou to take office. Sun Ke and other officials openly and secretly denied that the suspicions between Guangdong and Guangxi provinces were the cause of differences in government opinions, but they admitted that there were differences of opinion regarding the government's move to Guangzhou.

###  Guangzhou Bureau Chiefs Walk to Work

Because Cars Have Been Requisitioned

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, 11th] Since the various ministries and courtyards have moved south one after another, there is a great shortage of cars here. Almost all of the official cars of the bureau chiefs of the municipal government, from Mayor Ouyang down, have been requisitioned, making the bureau chiefs walk to work, which is also a small scene in the government's southward migration.

###  Lapham Returns to the United States in the Middle of the Month

The First Batch of EC Fertilizer Arrives in Our Country

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, 11th] Lapham stated that his visit to Guangzhou this time was to bid farewell to President Sun. He was ordered to return to the United States before the 16th to report to Congress on the economic cooperation in China, and to inspect the work of the branch office here and to contact the China Agricultural Rehabilitation Commission. As for the rumors that Lapham will hold a meeting with President Sun and others in Guangzhou to discuss US aid, he did not acknowledge it.

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, 11th] At the joint meeting of the Executive Yuan's US Aid Material Utilization Committee and the Economic Cooperation Sub-Office yesterday, Executive Yuan President Sun Ke expressed his hope to obtain more extensive assistance from the US government. Lapham paid special attention to Guangdong and Guangzhou, which have actually become the new political center of China.

[Our City News] The first batch of EC fertilizer has arrived in China. 900 metric tons of ammonium sulfate were shipped from Canada to Shanghai by the "Agnewen" today. US-aided fertilizer will be distributed to Chinese farmers through the Farmers Bank of China.

### The Next Legislative Yuan Meeting Will Be Held in Nanjing

[United Press Nanjing, 11th] According to United Press investigation: The opinions of qualified parties here show that Sun Ke's insistence on establishing his cabinet in Guangzhou may cost him his position. According to the disclosure of this investigation: When the Legislative Yuan convenes the next plenary session, the increasing condemnation of President Sun may become an organized movement. Qualified Legislative Yuan parties stated: The next Legislative Yuan meeting will be held in Nanjing, not in Guangzhou. It is generally believed that the decision to hold the five-court meeting in Nanjing will undoubtedly be a serious blow to President Sun's political position. The parties also stated: Although the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan has moved to Guangzhou and legislators in Guangzhou have requested that the meeting be held in a South China city, most legislators agree to stay in Nanjing. They also stated: The legislators who are currently staying in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas first decided to keep the Legislative Yuan in Nanjing and have obtained the support of legislators in Hankou, Guilin, and other three places. It is rumored that Shanghai legislators have sent representatives to Taiwan to obtain the support of legislators there. At the same time: People of high standing insist that Acting President Li and President Sun have no differences of opinion regarding the southward relocation of the Executive Yuan. The person also stated: Acting President Li has advised Sun Ke's cabinet to stay in Nanjing, and Li has not interfered in the recent dispute over the location of the Legislative Yuan meeting.

### Presidential Palace Staff Limited to Arriving in Guangzhou Before the Middle of the Month

### Zheng Yanfen Solemnly Denies the Saying That a Central Committee Plenary Session Will Be Held Regularly

[Central News Agency Guangzhou, 11th] Several newspapers in Hong Kong and Guangdong have recently reported that the Kuomintang will hold a plenary session of the Central Committee in Guangzhou on March 29th. According to Zheng Yanfen, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, who solemnly declared to reporters, the Central Party Headquarters has not considered the issue of holding a Central Committee Plenary Session after leaving Beijing and moving to Guangzhou. There is no scheduled meeting. The report that a plenary session will be held regularly is absolutely not true.

### Cheng Siyuan Returns to Beijing

[Our City News] Legislator Cheng Siyuan took a train to Beijing on the evening of the 11th after returning to Shanghai from Taiwan.

### National Army Rushes to Aid Yichang. The Situation Between Hankou and Yichang Turns Stable. Telecommunications are Restored. The Chongqing-Shanghai Air Route Remains Unobstructed.

[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 11th] Chief of Staff Liu received a long-distance call from the front line at 10:00 AM on the 11th: (1) The Communist army that invaded Yichang was repelled this morning. The Communist army has now fled to more than 40 miles away from Yichang. The 60th Division of the National Army has rushed to Yichang to increase its strength. (2) Sun Zhen is currently in Santouping.

[Our Newspaper Hankou, 11th] It is reported that the military telephone in Yichang was once blocked. On the 11th, the situation turned stable, and it has returned to normal.

[Our Newspaper Hankou, 11th] During the recent battle of Jingmen, the county magistrate of the county, Zou Shusheng, unfortunately died heroically while leading his troops to break through the siege.

[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 11th] The order in Yichang has not yet been restored. The Yimin Sheng Company's machine factory was robbed for three hours late at night on the 10th, suffering serious losses. Ships berthed at Ping Shanba Huangling Temple Santouping could not control the scattered soldiers who forcibly boarded the ships and lacked coal, and have not yet gone west today.

[Our Newspaper Hankou, 11th] A group of 14 Wuhan reporters from the front-line visiting group set off on the morning of the 11th to inspect the defense area in southern Henan.

[Our Newspaper Hengdian, Hubei-Henan Border, 11th] The reporter arrived at a certain place today with the Wuhan reporters' front-line inspection group and immediately interviewed General Zhang Gan and his strong soldiers of the Central China Fortress. Zhang declared at the tea party: The three columns of Liu Bocheng's troops, 1, 6, and 4, stationed in the Yancheng area, except for a part of the 4th column, have mostly fled north. The 2, 3, 6, and 12 columns west of Xincai have also moved northwest one after another. The various units of this corps are currently widely deployed within the borders of Henan and Hubei, preparing for strategic operations according to the opportunity. The Communist army will definitely not be able to invade the south in the short term. Even if they take risks, it is believed that they will be able to protect the land and defend the people. At about 7:00 PM, Zhang invited reporters to participate in the evening party. The army and the people were integrated and rejoiced together, and the atmosphere was very warm.

[Central News Agency Hankou, 11th] The Yangtze River Chongqing-Shanghai air route is still unimpeded. The Jianghan ship of the China Merchants Bureau sailed from Hankou to Shanghai on the 4th and arrived safely on the 9th. The Jianghe, Jiangshun, Jiangtai of the bureau and the Hongzhen, Hongheng of the Sanbei Company, and the Dada of the Yitai Company all sailed from Shanghai to Hankou and have passed Anqing and will arrive in the next few days. Also, the Minzu ship of the Minsheng Company passed Yichang yesterday and went west. The Mingui ship is now berthed in Shashi, and the navigation is very safe.

[United Press Nanjing, 11th] It was learned on the 11th that a large number of Communist troops crossed the Yellow River in northern Henan and advanced towards the Yangtze River front line. If this news is true, it is in sharp contrast to the continued silence of the war on the north bank of the Yangtze River. Observers believe that: (1) The CCP will insist on its peace conditions while preparing to cross the Yangtze River south with more troops to attack if the peace talks fail; (2) This new military force may be used to reinforce the Communist army that has withdrawn from the front line on the north bank of the Yangtze River for reorganization; (3) Continue to launch a nerve war against Hankou, because General Bai Chongxi has instructed his subordinates to fully prepare for war to meet the possible offensive. Observers believe that this new military force may have been transferred from the vicinity of Taiyuan, the besieged capital of Shanxi Province, where the pressure has apparently been reduced.

### Xu Kan and Others Inspect Huangpu

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, 11th] Finance Minister Xu Kan, President of the Central Bank Liu Gongyun, accompanied by Fang Du, Customs Commissioner of Guangdong Customs, and more than a dozen economic engineering experts, went to Huangpu yesterday to inspect the port opening project and make plans for future construction.

[Our Newspaper Lanzhou, 11th] The spokesman of the Northwest Pacification Headquarters released by telephone late last night that Zhang Zhizhong had resolutely telegraphed the central government to resign from the task of peace talk representative. It is generally believed that Zhang, who was enthusiastic about peace, suddenly became negative, which made the situation even more chaotic.

[Central News Agency Lanzhou, 11th] General Zhang Zhizhong believed that there were many things to be handled in the Northwest Military and Political Chief's Office, and Xinjiang also hoped that General Zhang would visit there. It was heard that he had telegraphed the Central Government to resign from the task of peace talk representative. The special plane Ziqiang sent by Acting President Li to welcome Zhang had returned to Beijing yesterday. Zhang will probably visit Xinjiang after the important affairs here are taken care of.

The recent broadcasts of a certain country and certain domestic newspapers that a certain senior general in the Northwest advocated fighting the Communist army to the end, and that a certain senior general opposed peace talks, are all unfounded rumors and should be denied.

### The US House of Representatives Un-American Activities Committee Investigates the Sorge Spy Case. The Directors of the Army and Navy Intelligence Bureaus Have Been Invited to Attend.

[United Press Washington, 10th] House investigators began investigating the Sorge spy ring on the 10th, which provided the Soviet Union with intelligence on Japanese and German plans before the Pearl Harbor incident, and whether it was linked to similar spy organizations in the United States.

The Un-American Activities Committee especially hopes to learn whether this Pacific region spy system has any connection with the Red spy network operating in the United States, as claimed by former communist member Chambers. Miss Smedley, a well-known writer and Stein, who were accused by the War Department of being members of the Sorge spy ring, have both denied being involved in the ring. Following Smedley, Stein also declared today that the reports about his relationship with the Sorge spy ring were "absurd and unfounded."

Major General Irwin, Director of the Army Intelligence Bureau, and Major General Inglis, Director of the Navy Intelligence Bureau, have both been invited to attend the House Un-American Activities Committee to report on all reports of the Japanese Red spy ring before the war, and whether the Japanese Red spy ring was linked to the activities of the Soviet spy ring in the United States. This announcement was issued on the same day as the War Department's Sorge spy ring report. Irwin and Inglis are scheduled to attend on the 11th. Federal Prosecutor Clark has also received an invitation. Committee Chairman Hoot told the press that Clark and intelligence officials would be invited to attend the committee at the same time to comply with the committee's new policy of cooperation with the executive branch.

[United Press Washington, 11th] It was learned on the 11th that former communist member Chambers stated in a secret meeting of the House Un-American Activities Committee on December 28th last year that he had recruited Americans for the Soviet Union's spy ring in Japan around 1934 or 1935. He told House investigators that he set up an activity base in the United States for these workers, which was a fictitious corporate alliance, and the organization provided the workers with passports, letters, and funds, but it was revoked in 1936 due to a false rumor that a worker was arrested in Japan.

At the time, this testimony did not cause much commotion. In the committee's report, it was only written: "Chambers said: The spy ring initially recruited personnel in the United States and launched activities in other countries, including Japan, Germany, Finland, and China."

A person involved with the House Un-American Activities Committee at the time said: It is not clear whether the spy ring mentioned by Chambers is the same as the Japanese Sorge spy ring, which the War Department announced on the 10th as the "most daring and successful in history."

[United Press Tokyo, 11th] Major General Willoughby, the main intelligence officer of MacArthur's headquarters, hinted on the 11th that there may also be spy organizations similar to the Sorge spy ring operating in Japan today, opposing American interests.

At a press conference, Willoughby was asked whether there were spy rings operating in Japan today that opposed American interests. Willoughby admitted that he would avoid a direct answer, and then said: The Sorge spy ring and the Soviet Union's spies in Canada, the United States, and four South American countries were of the same type, and continued: "We have no reason to believe that this type of spy organization will not continue to operate in other countries."

[United Press Washington, 10th] The War Department officially stated on the 10th that the post-war fantasy of Ozaki, the Japanese leader of the Soviet spy network, was a "useful indicator" of current communist ideology. The War Department stated: Ozaki's envisioned communist new order not only included Japan, China, and the Soviet Union, but also included South Korea, Malaya, Mongolia, the Philippines, Siam, the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam, and India. He dreamed that one day the people of these countries would form an all-East Asian Soviet Federal Republic with the Soviet Union in accordance with the Soviet Communist Party's views and methods. Although Japan would have enmity with China and other nations for trying to establish a new order in East Asia by force, it did have considerable appeal in its Pan-Asian propaganda. The countless assistance given to the Japanese invaders by Malaya and Burma is a recent matter. Today, we will hear many new orders and Pan-Asianism from China and India. Japan originally had excellent resources, but it was destroyed by its greed and violence.

[United Press New York, 11th] Female writer Smedley made a radio address to the nation today, denouncing the MacArthur report released by the War Department as an insult to her. It is said that this insult is a smokescreen for the United States' attempt to fully interfere in the Chinese civil war. She disdained to refute the report's statement that she was still at large, only saying that it was entirely a professional relationship and had to maintain contact with officials and the general public. Ms. Smith is now in Palisades, New York, working on her fifth book on China and her autobiography, "Daughter of Earth."

### Chongqing-Suiyuan Garrison Headquarters to Hold Southwest Military and Political Conference on the 15th of This Month. The Wanzhou Garrison Department Will Be Established Immediately in Eastern Sichuan.

He will return to Dachuan by special train on the 11th to take charge. In order to strengthen the self-defense forces in eastern Sichuan, the Garrison Headquarters has decided to establish a garrison command in Wanzhou immediately.

[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 11th] Qian Dajun is scheduled to fly from Beijing to Chongqing by special plane on the 13th. Zhang Qun will take office after Qian arrives in Chongqing. Xiao Yisu may come along.

### Our Government Welcomes Effective United Nations Mediation. Sun Ke Issues a Statement to Foreign Reporters.

[Central News Agency Guangzhou, 11th] Executive Yuan President Sun Ke issued an English statement to foreign reporters on the evening of the 11th regarding the Australian Foreign Minister Evatt's proposal that the United Nations mediate peace in China. The translation is as follows: The Chinese government welcomes the United Nations' mediation of peace in our country if it can be practical and effective. However, the other party must also be willing to accept the United Nations' mediation. In order to invite a third party to mediate peace, the government sent the same memorandum to the four countries of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union several weeks ago. If the United Nations can come forward to mediate, it can achieve the same goal of peace. So far, the government has made efforts for more than a month to achieve peace, but it has not been able to reach any common understanding with the Communist Party. Although the government has called for an unconditional ceasefire and has appointed peace representatives to meet with the Communist Party, the Communist Party has not shown any sincerity. Therefore, direct peace talks are unlikely. Under these circumstances, the United Nations' mediation may be the only practical way to achieve domestic peace in our country. Therefore, the government welcomes the proposal made by Australian Foreign Minister Evatt and hopes that this proposal can be accepted.

Speaker Pan Hopes that Evatt Will Formally Propose to the General Assembly

[Central News Agency This City News] Speaker Pan of the City Council expressed his welcome yesterday to the proposal made by Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, the President of the current United Nations General Assembly, that the United Nations mediate the war in China. Pan believes that the peace and stability of China is not just a matter for China alone, and the suffering of the Chinese people due to the war and the destruction of life and property throughout the country, as far as the United Nations is concerned as an organization for the peace of the world, it cannot sit idly by. Therefore, the Chinese people, regardless of east, west, north, south, men, women, old and young, should jointly devote themselves to promoting comprehensive peace, but if the United Nations can also come forward at this time to assist China in mediating the internal war in China in a peaceful way, it will be able to remove one of the destabilizing factors in the Far East and the world, and will be beneficial to lasting peace. Pan believes that the Chinese people will all be grateful for Evatt's proposal. He also deeply hopes that both the government and the CCP are really thinking about the people, and will not miss this good opportunity, and should immediately accept the assistance of the United Nations to mediate the domestic war, and hope that the Australian Foreign Minister can formally propose this proposal to the United Nations General Assembly in the near future.

Therefore, the doctor ordered him to rest for a week before he could exert himself. In response to the reporter's inquiries about the current situation and his meeting with Chairman Chen and the release of Zhang Xueliang, he only said that he could not tell anything except that he would visit Zhang Hanqing as soon as he recovered his strength. His expression seemed to be deeply moved. Mo also stated that he came here purely to visit Zhang's recent situation, and Acting President Li did not give him the order to take Zhang to Beijing immediately.

### Hubei Provincial Government and Participation Council Decide to Disperse into Two Groups

According to reports, Enshi and Chongyang will be the locations of the northwestern and southern Hubei administrative offices.

### Wuxi Local Public Groups Telegraph Request to Postpone Conscription

Editorial

### Welcoming the United Nations Mediation

Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, during a parliamentary debate on foreign affairs on the 9th of this month, suddenly proposed that the United Nations mediate the Chinese war. He said, "As for China, a long and tragic war has destabilized the entire country and delayed the post-war recovery and reconstruction that the long-suffering people have the right to enjoy. Therefore, I believe that the United Nations should assist in mediating to achieve a unanimous solution to save countless dying lives; this is in line with the principles of the United Nations. At present, due to the increasing and serious differences of opinion among the major powers, it is particularly necessary for the United Nations to undertake the task of mediation and reconciliation." Based on his compassion, the Australian Foreign Minister expressed deep sympathy for the Chinese people who have suffered from the disaster of war for a long time, and hoped that the Chinese war could be brought to a reasonable end as soon as possible to avoid the suffering of the people, and proposed the United Nations mediate the Chinese war, which is worthy of our attention and admiration. Moreover, Foreign Minister Evatt is currently the President of the United Nations General Assembly. This important and meaningful proposal, initiated by him, will undoubtedly receive a good response from representatives of various countries in the United Nations once it is formally proposed.

According to a dispatch from our Nanjing on the 10th, regarding the suggestion by the Australian Foreign Minister Evatt that the United Nations mediate the Chinese war, political figures here have reacted very favorably. A certain government official told reporters: After the government repeatedly declared its sincerity in seeking peace with the Communist Party of China (CPC) but was repeatedly rejected by the CPC, the end of the Chinese civil war will inevitably require international mediation. The Australian Foreign Minister's proposal will undoubtedly be valued and accepted by representatives of various countries in the United Nations. After eight years of resistance against Japan, China soon after victory broke into a civil war, causing unspeakable suffering to the people. The United Nations, which was created to resist violence, should not turn a blind eye to the serious disaster that its former ally, the Chinese people, are facing today. Shanghai Municipal Council Speaker Pan, standing on the side of the representatives of the people of China's largest city, also first expressed his welcome to the United Nations mediation yesterday.

Originally, standing on the position of the nation and the race, we should first feel ashamed of the international mediation of our civil war. In today's era of the people, why can't we ordinary people solve our own domestic affairs and have to be mediated by the international community? Unless it is a self-abandoned person who is troubled by inferiority complex, will he welcome international intervention! Furthermore, exploring lessons from history, the result of international mediation of civil wars is often more harmful than beneficial. The scene of Russia, Germany, and France intervening to return the Liaodong Peninsula is not far away. Therefore, we have always had doubts about international intervention. However, if we start from realism, then under certain circumstances, the goodwill efforts and fair mediation of friendly countries to resolve difficulties and turn hostility into peace is also welcomed by our people. According to the actual situation in the country today, after eight years of resistance against Japan and three years of civil war, no less than tens of millions of people have died in the war. Even those who are lucky enough to survive are either displaced or starving and freezing. If the civil war does not stop, then these survivors will either die in the war or will not be able to survive. Therefore, a ceasefire and peace negotiation is the unanimous request of the entire country. President Chiang's New Year's Day message has already declared to the people that the government is indeed willing to abandon war and make peace. President Chiang himself has shown his sincerity in seeking peace by retiring, and Acting President Li has even said that he is willing to use the highest sincerity and the greatest efforts to seek the realization of peace. Even on the CPC side, Mr. Mao Zedong could not but say: To reduce the suffering of the people, we are willing to shorten the war period. Theoretically, a ceasefire and peace talks between the two sides is already the current national policy, and peace is not difficult to realize immediately. However, in the past three months, twists and turns have occurred one after another, and there are many trivial issues, and the prospect of peace seems to be full of thorns. Before the Sun cabinet went to Guangzhou, Foreign Minister Wu once hinted to the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union that they were willing to jointly mediate, but because the four countries each responded individually, citing the need to abide by the 1945 Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Declaration, they did not want to get involved in the Chinese civil war, so it was never realized. The people of the country, in view of the fact that the four countries themselves have different interests in any international event, are also very indifferent to this and do not pay much attention to it. Therefore, the theory of international mediation has also disappeared. 

However, this time the Australian Foreign Minister's proposal for United Nations mediation is different from the past and has aroused great attention from the entire country. First, from a legal point of view, the basic principle of the United Nations lies in eliminating wars and ensuring world peace and human happiness by promoting international cooperation and understanding, and any international dispute must be resolved by peaceful means. Although the Chinese war is not an obvious international war, under the principle that peace is indivisible, no one can guarantee that the Chinese war will not expand into an international war. Therefore, from this point of view, the United Nations has the responsibility and obligation to mediate the Chinese civil war. Second, in reality, the CPC has regarded itself as the victor and insists on the government's unconditional surrender in peace talks, which is not only unacceptable to the government, but also cannot be agreed upon by fair-minded people. This is why the prospect of peace talks is becoming increasingly bleak. If the people's appeal is still powerless, and there is no external mediation, then the civil war will continue, and the people will still be subjected to the ravages of war. Therefore, it is only natural for everyone to hope that the United Nations can come forward to mediate. Third, in terms of the method of mediation, United Nations mediation is more practical and easier to implement than four-power joint mediation. It can not only avoid the suspicion of "interfering in China's internal affairs," but also eliminate the doubts of the Chinese people about the consequences of great power mediation. Therefore, we still hope that the four powers can work together within the framework of the United Nations to promote an early end to the Chinese war. This is not only the fortune of the Chinese people, but also the blessing of world peace. All countries must know that the stability and peace of China are also of great importance to the happiness of the people of all countries in the world. At this moment, the United Nations should seize the opportunity. If the Australian Foreign Minister has a formal proposal, it must immediately take effective action!

### Chen Cheng Reports on Provincial Affairs; Economic Issues are the Focus of Governance; Six Principles for Public and Education Treatment are Set

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 11th] Chairman Chen today made a broad report on the governance situation in the past month at a press conference held by the Provincial Information Office, and comprehensively answered inquiries. Chen said: In the past month, economic issues have been the focus of governance. It has been decided to organize an Economic Construction Research Committee, and relevant supervisors and experts will be hired as members. The main task is to study the situation of production supply and demand and the economic changes, so that state-owned and provincial-owned production enterprises can respectively formulate central tasks to cooperate with the national economy and achieve the Principle of People's Livelihood. The existing industrial, mining, agricultural, and forestry enterprises will be reorganized, and those with redundant branches will be cut or merged, which is currently under review. Regarding the issue of public and education treatment, six principles have now been decided: (1) Equal pay for equal work in the same place, regardless of provincial or county level. (2) Consistency between civil and military personnel. (3) Approximation of the difference. (4) Additional grades for technical personnel. (5) Seniority grade increases. (6) In-kind distribution. This new treatment method will be implemented from March, and February will be supplemented with salary loans.

(2) The conscription issue is in the preparatory stage, but it will never be conscripted in the 38th year. (3) Taipei City will use vacant land to build 500 houses to solve the housing shortage.

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 11th] Chairman Chen recently agreed with the National Resources Commission to allocate 3,000 tons of sugar, worth about NT$10 billion, as a special fund to improve public and education treatment. The fund will not be used to increase salaries, but will be used to enrich the fund for in-kind distribution.

### Workers Carelessly Disassemble Discarded Bombs; Ammunition Depot in Guangzhou Suburbs Explodes; More Than Forty People Including the Factory Director Die Miserably

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 11th] The Tenth Depot of the Waste Products Department of the 80th Ordnance Repair Factory of the Joint Logistics Department in Shijing, about 30 kilometers from the urban area of Guangzhou (formerly the Shijing Ordnance Factory), exploded at 9:00 a.m. on the 11th due to workers carelessly disassembling discarded bombs, triggering the hand grenades, mortar shells, small landmines, and ordinary artillery shells left by the former Japanese army stored in the depot. The rumbling sound spread far and wide, and could be heard clearly in Guangzhou. The depot was originally a large bungalow with cement pillars and tile surface, about two zhang high and eight zhang long. The entire building collapsed. Only five of the forty-seven workers escaped, and four of them were injured. The factory director, after hearing the first loud noise, rushed to the depot to inspect it. The second, most powerful ammunition exploded, and he was tragically killed by the blast. As of 4:00 p.m. when the reporter left the area, the ammunition was still exploding continuously. A loud noise occurred almost every few minutes, and the flames shot into the sky. The First Detachment of Yubei Rescue and the Guangzhou Fire Brigade dispatched fire trucks to rescue, but could not get close. Now the authorities have only assigned a large number of soldiers to be on guard on all sides to maintain order.

### Sichuan Registers Unemployed Farmers

### Communist Radio Broadcasts Criticisms of Two American Reporters

[News Agency Report] San Francisco, 11th Broadcast: The Shaanxi Communist Radio Station broadcast today that the news sent by Associated Press reporter Musa and United Press reporter Jian were "slanders against the people of Beiping," which aroused the anger of the people of Beiping and gave them fierce criticism. According to the radio station, the protesters against the two reporters included Professor Wen Jiashi of Peking University, workers of Jibei Electric Power Company, and the Student Union of Yenching University, who demanded that "they should apologize to the people of Beiping, and believe that they are pawns of American imperialism. Now that they are allowed to continue their activities, "they should be deported." The radio station also pointed out that in the reports of these two reporters, "they believed that the people of Beiping had welcomed the Japanese, Americans and Kuomintang with the same attitude as they welcome the Liberation Army today," which caused dissatisfaction among the Communists. Furthermore, because Associated Press Shanghai reporter Hampson reported on the 10th that the "foreign reporters in Shanghai took the Shaanxi radio station's attack on Musa and Ji Yi very seriously," the radio station said: "Hampson's logic is that only slanderers are allowed to slander others, and those who are slandered are not allowed to know this kind of slander." It also said: "The era of intimidating the Chinese people with this logic of aggressors is over. This is where Hampson, Musa and Ji Yi and others are unlucky." It is said that when the Communist army occupied Beiping, they once publicly stated that any news can be freely sent, but now the news published in the newspapers in Pingjin is very little, and most of them cannot satisfy the wishes of the readers.

[United Press Dispatch] The answer from the Communist side on the question of "whether the Communist Party will allow reporters from all over the world to continue working in their territory" seems to be "no" for the time being. The criticism of United Press reporter Musa and United Press reporter Ji Ang by the Chinese newspapers in Beiping was apparently caused by the Chinese broadcast of the Shaanxi Communist Radio Station the night before. The Communist Radio Station issued a lengthy broadcast in international telegraph code last night, demanding the expulsion of Musa and Ji Ang. The reason is that the two reporters reported that the people of Beiping welcomed the Communist army, but the wording was inappropriate. In fact, the two only said that some people welcomed the Communist army very sincerely, another part just went to the venue to watch, and the welcoming actions of another part seemed not entirely from the heart. The Communist side accused Musa of comparing the entry of the Communist army with the past Japanese army, American army and Kuomintang army. Musa did not have this kind of report. Only United Press reporter White stationed in Nanjing criticized the Beiping Communist army's entry parade, mentioning that the people of Beiping had welcomed the Japanese army in the past, saying that it has become a habit for the Chinese people, like most people in the world, to participate in parades and celebrations. How the case develops is enough to test whether news reporters can freely work in the territory of China under Communist rule in the future.

### Shigeru Yoshida Re-Elected as the New Prime Minister of Japan; Plans to Form a Conservative Cabinet of Two Parties; MacArthur Agrees to This Decision

[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] After Shigeru Yoshida resigned this morning in accordance with constitutional procedures, he was re-elected as prime minister by an absolute majority of 350 votes in the House of Representatives. The total number of valid votes was 451. When the members voted, Yoshida sat quietly in his seat and never stood up except when it was his turn to vote. His body was short, and his line of sight was obscured by the table, making it difficult to see the voting situation, but he smiled, confident that he was sure to be elected.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 11th] The 77-year-old Kijuro Shidehara, the elder of the Japanese Democratic Party, was unanimously supported by the members of the conservative group, and was elected as the Speaker of the Japanese House of Representatives with a majority of 346 votes. The Socialist Party member Yonekubo, who competed with him, although supported by the left-wing members, only received 91 votes and ultimately failed. It is said that Shidehara will replace Matsuoka of the Socialist Party as the Speaker. As for the seat of Vice Speaker of the House of Representatives, it will be taken by Osamu Osatake of the Liberal Party.

[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 11th] Hirokawa, the Secretary-General of the Japanese Liberal Party, announced at its headquarters late on the 10th that "as a result of the second meeting between Yoshida and Inukai, it is believed that in order to overcome the current economic crisis in Japan, a coalition government composed of two conservative parties must be formed in order to obtain long-term stability." Hirokawa also stated that this decision has been agreed by MacArthur. Hirokawa announced this time that the conservative coalition government will be announced in the form of a joint statement by Yoshida and Inukai, the presidents of the two parties. Afterwards, Hirokawa told reporters that this decision is only a decision in principle. As for how the two parties will allocate cabinet positions in the future and whether to formulate a policy agreement, it has not yet been discussed.

[Another dispatch] Since Inukai and Yoshida's meeting on the 10th decided on the principle of a conservative coalition cabinet, the phenomenon of division within the Democratic Party has become very obvious. The Ashida faction firmly opposes cooperation with Yoshida. As a result, seven or eight members of the Ashida faction will withdraw from the Democratic Party. However, it is not clear whether they will form a new party or join other parties.

### If War Breaks Out Between the US and USSR, the US Plans to Withdraw from Japan; Military Experts Believe the Far East Has No Defensive Value

[United Press International, Tokyo, 11th] According to several senior US military strategists, if war breaks out between the US and USSR, the US is prepared to withdraw from Japan. They believe that the entire Far East has no defensive value. In a war, the European continent will become the decisive battlefield, and the US must maintain a foothold in Europe, or prepare to fight for fifteen to twenty years to win the final victory.

In view of this strategy, the entire US position in the Pacific and the Far East, from Alaska to Pearl Harbor, will be carefully reviewed. The Communist victory in China has further strengthened the "Europe first" concept. In the eyes of many military planners, whether Japan has any military value is highly questionable. Moreover, they believe that the task of feeding and supporting tens of millions of Japanese people in wartime is bound to outweigh the benefits Japan can provide to the US.

[United Press International, Tokyo, 11th] The Japanese people learned the news on the 11th with shock, horror, and a degree of disbelief, that the US is prepared to withdraw from Japan if the Soviet Union invades.

### US Aid to Europe Aims to Promote Unity

Aid to China to be Discussed in Secret Later; Acheson Declares to Congress

[Our Own Dispatch] Washington, 11th (Broadcast): US Secretary of State Dean Acheson stated in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that US economic aid cannot be used as a tool to force Western European countries to implement political unity. The US will encourage such unity, but the final decision rests with the Europeans themselves. Regarding inquiries about the North Atlantic Treaty or possible aid to China, Acheson declined to answer publicly, but suggested discussing such issues in secret later. Acheson denied that the US recovery fund hinders economic cooperation between European countries, and said that the Brussels Treaty, the Organization for European Economic Cooperation, and the newly organized European Parliament are all important steps in promoting European political, economic, and social unity.

### Lie Expresses His Views; Comments on Regional Treaties

Should Be Based on Strengthening the United Nations as a Principle

[Our Own Dispatch] New York, 11th (Broadcast): Lake Success Dispatch - UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie warned today that any regional treaty that replaces "genuine universal collective security" will ultimately endanger lasting peace. Lie did not specifically point out whether he was referring to the North Atlantic Treaty or other regional treaties, but stated that any regional convention should "strengthen the United Nations organization rather than weaken it." Since the UN organization has failed to achieve results in handling several important international disputes, regional military or economic conventions have greatly increased. This is Lie's first comment on this.

### The Soviet Union Insists on Including a Ban on Employing Foreign Military Personnel in the Austrian Peace Treaty

[Our Own Dispatch] London, 11th (Broadcast): During the Four Powers' discussion of the Austrian peace treaty, Soviet representative Cherubin insisted that Austria be prohibited from employing foreign military advisors and technicians, and that this should be stipulated in the Austrian peace treaty. Western sources said that Cherubin was clearly afraid that the US would send military advisors to Austria, as US Army officers in Greece have made great contributions to the Greek government's fight against communist guerrillas. Cherubin gave a lengthy speech supporting the proposed ban on Austria.

### Fifteen Protestant Leaders Arrested

Similar to the Mindszenty Case in Substance

[Our Own Dispatch] Washington, 11th (Broadcast): US State Department officials believe that the arrest of fifteen Protestant leaders in Bulgaria is a trick played by the minority communists in satellite countries, and that the nature of this matter is similar to the case of Bishop Mindszenty in Hungary. Experts believe that the arrest of Christian leaders is a further manifestation of the Bulgarian authorities' suppression of religious freedom.

[Our Own Dispatch] London, 11th (Broadcast): A Foreign Office spokesman criticized the arrest of fifteen Protestant leaders in Bulgaria, saying that Eastern European countries are now attacking the church in a unified way, creating a communist monolithic situation. The British government is currently considering further action based on the peace treaty with Bulgaria, which guarantees religious freedom.

[United Press International, Sofia, 10th] The Bulgarian government tonight filed public charges against ten leaders of the United Evangelical Church, accusing them of providing espionage to British and American intelligence, conspiring to overthrow the government, and violating foreign exchange control regulations. The representative of the Church, Chipkov, was listed as a prisoner. The United Evangelical Church is composed of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Baptist Church, and the Pentecostal Church.

### Soviet Union's New Proposal Ultimately Vetoed; Security Council Passes US Proposal; Disarmament Issue Assigned to the Armaments Commission for Study

[United Press International, Lake Success, 10th] The Security Council on the 10th defeated the Soviet Union's recent proposal to reduce the armaments of the five major powers by one-third, and the US proposal to publicly report its atomic bomb stockpile. After listening to Soviet representative Malik's accusation on the afternoon of the 10th that the US was engaged in a "mad arms race" that would drag the world into a new war, the Security Council rejected the Soviet proposal by a vote of two against zero, with another vote abstaining.

At the same time, the Security Council passed the US proposal by a vote of nine against zero, with two abstentions, namely that the Security Council would transfer a resolution passed by the UN General Assembly last autumn to the Permanent Armaments Commission. According to this UN General Assembly resolution, the possibility of disarmament will not be discussed until the tense situation in the world ceases, but the Permanent Armaments Commission should first draft a plan to investigate the military facilities of various countries in order to study the issue of arms limitation.

### North Korea Submits Application Requesting to Join the United Nations

[United Press International, Lake Success, 10th] The North Korean government applied to join the United Nations on the 10th, but South Korea, supported by the United States, is recognized by most countries in the United Nations as the only legitimate government of Korea, and has already applied to join. In view of the fact that the UN General Assembly does not recognize the northern region of Korea, Secretary-General Lie only forwarded North Korea's application to the members of the Security Council for reference. North Korean Foreign Minister Baik Hong-yong (transliteration) stated in his application that the North Korean government "is willing to cooperate with other peace-loving countries to maintain peace and international security." North Korea's application seems that it will never be resolved by the Council, and South Korea's request will inevitably be vetoed by the Soviet Union.

### North Atlantic Security Treaty Issue; US and Norway Hold Talks Again; US Refuses Military Aid to the Neutral Nordic Alliance

[United Press International, Washington, 11th] Diplomatic authorities announced today that Norway has expressed to the United States its willingness to find a way to mediate the dispute between Sweden and the United States regarding Scandinavia's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty. Secretary of State Acheson held his final meeting with Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange today, and is expected to state the US position, provide facts, and answer Lange's questions regarding Norway's obligations and benefits after joining the North Atlantic Treaty.

Regarding Sweden's proposal to establish a Scandinavian "neutral" defense alliance, the Secretary of State has refused and made it clear that such an alliance cannot hope to obtain US military assistance and advisors. However, Lange told Acheson during his visit four days ago that Norway fully sympathizes with the West in the Cold War between Western countries and the Soviet Union.

### Matos Announces Withdrawal; Portuguese Presidential Election

### Commander-in-Chief Tang Announced Five Principles for Maintaining Public Order Yesterday; The Public Should Not Panic Due to the Solidification of River Defenses

[Central News Agency Dispatch] General Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison, held a reception for local figures and newspaper reporters at the New Life Club yesterday (11th) afternoon at 3:00 PM, where he immediately announced five major principles for maintaining the city's public order. He hoped that all citizens would abide by them and cooperate to ensure the stability of Shanghai's public order and society, and seek comprehensive and reasonable peace. Tang resolutely stated that the Yangtze River defenses are extremely solid. The National Army's shift to defend the river is not due to an inability to perform their duties, but to show the government's sincerity in seeking peace. If the Communist Party disregards this and insists on acting recklessly, attempting to cross the river and invade Beijing and Shanghai, it will be by no means easy. He claimed that the Communist army's pipe dream of crossing the river near Beijing and Shanghai will be shattered without exception. He particularly pointed out that the National Army's strength in defending Shanghai is more than sufficient, and will definitely not encounter the same fate as Changchun, Shenyang, Pingjin. Therefore, the citizens of the whole city really do not need to panic. Tang said in his speech that the government could not bear to see the people continue to suffer from the ravages of artillery fire. Since the President issued a message on New Year's Day and took the lead in retiring, Acting President Li has been striving for comprehensive peace with compromise. He, Tang, was ordered to guard the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou area, and acutely feels the importance of his responsibility. However, soldiers take obeying orders and defending the country and protecting the people as their duty. He vowed to do his best to protect the lives and property of the people. Especially Shanghai is an international city, and the center of our country's culture and economy, it is all the more important to strengthen defense, calm people's hearts, and seek to stabilize social order. He believes that today's China must ensure that the people can obtain genuine peace, genuine democracy, and genuine freedom, and enjoy the happiness of living and working in peace, and then China will have hope of rejuvenation. This is why he wholeheartedly supports Acting President Li's painstaking efforts to seek comprehensive peace, and his Shanghai compatriots agree with him without prior consultation. However, today's Shanghai is a martial law area close to the war zone, and social stability should be the first priority, and maintaining order is the most important. However, due to the large population and complex elements, there are unscrupulous people lurking and carrying out activities, and they often distort the government's painstaking measures, and use all kinds of tricks to sow discord, resulting in confusion in public opinion, rumors flying everywhere, people's hearts are floating, and order is also affected. Employees often gather crowds to coerce and make unreasonable demands, disregarding the law, and making a loud noise. They may cause trains to stop, streetcars to strike, or threaten their supervisors, and even obstruct traffic and affect public utilities, which harms the daily lives of millions of citizens. This phenomenon is not only his responsibility to correct and stop, but also deeply hated by all citizens of Shanghai. In fact, so-called democracy must require everyone to abide by the law, freedom must not harm the freedom of others, and peace must require jointly observing order. He is duty-bound to defend the country and protect the people, but the completion of the task depends on the sincere cooperation of people from all walks of life and all his comrades. Therefore, he specially invites you gentlemen to express your opinions and work together to overcome difficulties. He hereby provides the following items as the principles for all walks of life in the city to abide by at present:

(1) The statements and records in newspapers and publications must be based on correct facts, and no rumors or misrepresentations shall be made to confuse the public, and they must be based on stabilizing people's hearts and maintaining social order. All newspapers and publications that have been suspended shall not be resumed without the permission of the competent authorities. (2) The payment of workers' wages shall be handled in accordance with laws and customs, and no excessive or unreasonable demands shall be made. If there are any opinions on improving treatment, they must apply to the competent authorities for handling in accordance with the law, and there shall be no gathering of crowds to coerce, strike, slow down, or similar riotous acts. (3) School students should be considerate of the country's difficulties, use more reason, and not take actions that affect social order, so as not to be used by others and serve as a sacrifice. (4) People from all walks of life should know that the maintenance of social order and the security of public order are the responsibility of every citizen. Therefore, all actions must not violate martial law. For self-defense, relief, and condolences, it is hoped that wealthy citizens will generously donate and share the difficulties together. (5) The troops stationed in the city must strictly abide by the order on rectifying military discipline in Shanghai issued by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters on February 8. Any violations will be severely punished without leniency, and it is hoped that citizens will assist in the inspection and maintenance of military discipline, so as to maintain social order.

### Strictly Prohibit Strikes and Other Behaviors, the Leaders Will Be Executed on the Spot; The Issue of Troop Housing Has Been Resolved Through Discussion

Tang added to the point of prohibiting strikes and slowdowns, stating that he has ordered the garrison commanders in the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou area that from now on, employees of any institution, regardless of the reason, are not allowed to have strikes, slowdowns, gatherings to coerce, or riotous acts. If such acts occur, they will be severely punished in accordance with martial law, and the garrison commanders in various places are authorized to execute the leaders on the spot in accordance with military law.

Tang said that regarding the issue of military discipline, he has studied improvements with Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, and Chairman Fang. The two major difficulties currently affecting military discipline are the housing problem and the soldiers' food problem, which have now been gradually improved. Regarding the housing problem, because there is a shortage of barracks near Shanghai, it is inconvenient for the military to live in civilian houses, and it is also inconvenient for the military. A solution has now been decided. Those temporarily allowed to station troops include the following three types: (1) schools that have not yet started classes, (2) factories that have stopped work, and (3) vacant warehouses. In this way, it is believed that borrowing and living in civilian houses can be avoided. Regarding the problem of soldiers' food, because the soldiers' non-staple food expenses are meager and prices in Shanghai are high, it is difficult to maintain. From this month, the non-staple food expenses for soldiers in the Beijing-Shanghai area have been increased to 1,200 yuan, which is based on the standard of each person receiving two pounds of meat, two pounds of oil, and one pound of salt per month. In addition, firewood and vegetables have been decided by the municipal government to subsidize. Starting from today, with the resolution of the above two problems, it is believed that maintaining military discipline will not be a problem. He mentioned that Shanghai is the transportation hub of the country, and personnel evacuated from various places must pass through Shanghai. Military agencies coming to Shanghai may have deficiencies in management, which affect the relationship between the military and civilians. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters is trying to improve it as much as possible in order to achieve the ideal of not violating the slightest and maintaining peace between the military and the people.

Mayor Wu Points Out the Hopes of the Citizens

The heads of various circles attending the reception included Mayor Wu Guozhen, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Chairman Fang Zhi, Deputy Speaker Xu Jiyi, and about 200 people from various circles and newspaper reporters. After Tang's report, Mayor Wu took the floor and pointed out the common hopes of the citizens of the whole city, which are (1) that comprehensive peace can be realized, and (2) that Shanghai can obtain stability. Shanghai can do nothing about the former, but the latter is closely related to their own interests and should be worked hard together. However, he concealed that there are not a few people in the city who deliberately sabotage stability and take advantage of the opportunity to cause trouble. These people are the public enemy of the citizens of the whole city. Therefore, Commander Tang's announced five principles are to protect the safety and interests of the public, and we should unanimously support and abide by them, and request Commander Tang to strictly enforce them. Chairman Fang delivered a speech, providing two points of view: (1) Eliminate the conspirators who are engaged in sabotage and sow discord, and (2) All citizens should immediately contribute money if they have money, and donate materials if they have materials, to comfort the armed soldiers.

Speaker Pan Suggests Strengthening Comfort to the Troops

Speaker Pan delivered a speech, first expressing his feelings, saying that after listening to Commander Tang's words, it can be seen that the central and local governments have completely consistent views on seeking comprehensive peace. He also suggested that the work of comforting the troops should be strengthened immediately. Only by being able to fight can there be peace, but surrender is absolutely not allowed. Pan praised the hard work and tenacious spirit of the army and people of Taiyuan under the leadership of General Yan Xishan, which is worth emulating by the citizens of Shanghai. He said that Beijing and Shanghai are the heart of the country and must not be shaken. Therefore, he advocated that in order to consolidate Beijing and Shanghai, a certain percentage of the taxes paid by the citizens of Shanghai should be extracted as the cost of consolidating Beijing and Shanghai, and every penny should be used on the soldiers, so that the soldiers can get the best enjoyment, so that morale will be greatly boosted, and they can fight and make peace.

Answer Reporters' Questions

Finally, Commander Tang stood up again to deliver a speech and answered the written questions raised by reporters. Tang said: (1) The combat effectiveness of the army must be cultivated with spirit and material. Therefore, in the future, he will try his best to improve the treatment of the army and ask the central government to increase it. (2) Regarding the issue of stabilizing prices, he will invite relevant agencies and experts to discuss methods in the near future. (3) The matter of soldiers living in civilian houses in Zhabei will be handled by the Garrison Department. He has ordered a general inspection of the houses occupied by soldiers within a week, and such matters will gradually be reduced. (4) Regarding the construction project issue, whether it is for peace or war, the construction project is necessary. If Shanghai is not defended, it will not have the qualifications for peace. The expenses of the construction project are all borrowed from the Central Bank, without using a penny of local money, and some businessmen take the opportunity to raise the prices of the materials needed for the construction project, which is really inappropriate. Tang also cited the suffering of the people in Northeast China and Beiping Jinan and other places recently, which can serve as a lesson for people in other places. Tang concluded this reception with the words "I am determined to serve the people of Shanghai, to serve the interests of all the citizens of Shanghai, and Shanghai will be able to maintain permanent freedom and integrity."

### Public Utilities Again Set New Prices, Increasing Two and a Half to Three Times

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the Lunar New Year, the prices of various commodities have risen sharply, especially the prices of American care oil, materials, and coal, which have increased more than fivefold, making it impossible for various public utility companies to maintain operations. They have successively requested the revision of new prices. The Public Utilities Bureau summoned the persons in charge of various companies for the past two days to conduct a thorough review of each company's income and expenditure situation and actual required costs. The two sides argued fiercely. The Public Utilities Bureau believed that while maintaining the company's operation was important, the burden on citizens must also be taken into consideration. After repeated negotiations, a solution was finally reached. The increase rate was two and a half to three times. After being submitted to the mayor for approval, water, electricity, gas, and telephone charges will be calculated based on meter readings starting today (the 12th), and public transportation will be implemented starting tomorrow (the 13th). The new prices are recorded in the table below:

Tap Water (per cubic meter)

Electricity (per unit)

Gas (per 100 cubic feet)

Within 10 units 190 yuan Above 10 units within the limit 320 yuan

Telephone (per call)

1-150 calls 25 yuan 151-300 calls 30 yuan

Above 301 calls 35 yuan

Public telephone per call 30 yuan

Tram

First class 30 yuan 40 yuan 50 yuan 60 yuan 70 yuan

Third class 20 yuan 30 yuan 35 yuan 40 yuan 45 yuan

Public Bus

30 yuan 45 yuan 60 yuan 70 yuan 80 yuan 90 yuan

Ferry

Across 25 yuan Long ferry 20 yuan per nautical mile

Small Railway

10 yuan per kilometer per person

The method of unit calculation is still under research

[Another Report] Each public utility company calculates the price adjustment each time based on the current cost. However, due to the rapid devaluation of the currency, it quickly becomes inaccurate and suffers greatly. Therefore, a unit calculation method has been proposed to the municipal authorities to reduce the losses caused by the devaluation of the currency. It is reported that this method is being carefully studied by the competent authorities.

Regarding the request of machine workers in the Pudong district to change their wages to rice, the Social Affairs Bureau stated that this matter involves too much and is practically difficult, so it does not intend to mediate.

### Some Schools Adopt Inferior Practices, Rush to Collect Tuition Fees and Collect Rice After the Deadline; The Education Bureau Strictly Prohibits Such Practices; Parents Can Report

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Education Bureau received letters from students' parents reporting that tuition fees are high this semester and parents bear a heavy burden. Some schools are rushing to collect fees, and if parents fail to raise the money in time, the school will collect white japonica rice instead. This practice has never happened before. The person in charge of the Education Bureau said yesterday that this situation is absolutely not allowed. The fee standards for this semester were previously agreed upon by Mayor Wu, senators, and school principals. The Education Bureau has issued an order to all schools to strictly comply. If any overcharging is discovered, parents can report to the Education Bureau, and the Bureau will send personnel to investigate thoroughly. If the report is true, the school will be ordered to dismiss the principal.

[Another Report] Recently, various schools in the city have set deadlines for paying fees, resulting in the situation where the children of employees of various bureaus and offices of the municipal government have been denied enrollment. Li Ximou, Director of the Education Bureau, made a special statement yesterday, saying that the request for free education for the children of municipal government employees should be limited to direct relatives, that is, their own children. If the payment of tuition and miscellaneous fees is delayed due to raising funds, schools should allow them to enroll first and postpone the payment of fees until the end of this month, and should not cancel their places on the pretext of the deadline. Regarding the issue of free education for the children of journalists, the authorities have made careful consideration. The principle of free education is no longer a problem. However, whether it is fully free or half-free has not been decided. In addition, the opening of schools in the garrison area has been scheduled for 3 p.m. on the 12th, when a meeting will be convened with the principals of the schools in the garrison area to discuss and decide.

### National Peace Promotion Association to Open Today at the Senate; President and Vice President Invited Senators Yesterday to Solicit Opinions

[Report from Our Newspaper] The National Peace Promotion Association is scheduled to open at 2 p.m. today at the Shanghai Municipal Senate Hall on Tanggu Road. As of yesterday, delegates from the Senate of various provinces and cities had reported to Shanghai from sixteen units. More than ten people are still on the way. Other representatives of national professional groups who have reported have also exceeded a dozen units.

Pan Gongzhan and Xu Jikui, President and Vice President of the Municipal Senate, held a tea party at the Senate at 10 a.m. yesterday to invite all senators in the city. More than 30 people attended. President Pan presided over the meeting and first reported on the government's efforts to seek peace since the New Year and explained the significance of convening the National Peace Promotion Association. He hoped that all senators would express their opinions on the peace talks as much as possible, so that they could be summarized and submitted for reference at today's meeting. Then Senators Yan E'sheng, Zhang Zhongyuan, Tong Xiang, Zhou Lianze, Jiang Hao, Jiang Haoran, and others successively delivered speeches, speaking enthusiastically about the issue of promoting peace. They unanimously believed that under the current circumstances, peace is the most urgent need of the people of the whole country, and the power of the people must be thoroughly promoted to achieve it as soon as possible. Some senators also expressed that those who participate in the peace movement must abandon their own interests and take striving for the welfare of the entire people as a prerequisite. President Pan also hoped that the people in the territories ruled by the Kuomintang and the Communist Party could communicate their opinions and form a truly decisive force for peace. The tea party lasted for more than two hours and did not end until 12:30 p.m. At 6 p.m., Qian Xinzhi, Du Yuesheng, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jikui, Liu Hongsheng, Wang Xiaolai and other six people jointly hosted a banquet at the Lido Garden to entertain representatives from all over the country who came to Shanghai to participate in the National Peace Promotion Association and exchanged preliminary views.

The President's Report: Significance, Tasks, and Opinions Must Be Consistent

The following is an excerpt from President Pan's speech: President Pan said: The convening of the National Peace Promotion Association is of great significance and importance. We must seek consistency of opinion from the standpoint of the people. The Senate of seven provinces and cities in Hubei has replied to our Association by telegram, deciding to send the resolutions of the Association to Shanghai for reference. We hope that the senators of our city can also actively express their opinions, and after my colleague, Vice President Xu, and I carefully sort them out, submit them to the conference for discussion. The guests invited to this conference are the presidents and vice presidents of various provinces and representatives of people's organizations, so they can more represent public opinion. At this conference, representatives from all over the country will surely express valuable opinions, and we hope to reach an agreement.

The First Need for Peace Talks is to Uncover the Iron Curtain and Communicate the Opinions of the People in the Two Regions

Peace is, of course, something that everyone hopes to achieve, but the specific methods for seeking peace still need to be discussed by representatives sent by the government and the Chinese Communist Party. I believe that the biggest difficulty in peace talks is that the people in the areas of the central government and the people in the areas of the Communist Party are still unable to make contact. Until now, we have not heard the people in the Communist areas issue a call for peace. Do they not want peace? Therefore, I believe that the first need for peace talks is to find a way to uncover this "iron curtain" so that the people in the two regions can communicate with each other and the people in the Communist areas can truly express their opinions and exert their potential, then peace will naturally come to fruition.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 11th] Regarding the matter of sending representatives to participate in the National Peace Promotion Association convened in Shanghai, the Taiwan Provincial Senate recently resolved that it was too late to receive the notification and could not send personnel to participate. However, the Senate has always supported the promotion of peace and is willing to work together.

[Report from Our Newspaper] On the ninth day of this month, family members of the passengers who died in the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company’s Jiangya ship went to the company to petition. The company saw that there were many people and feared that an accident would occur, so it closed its doors to refuse them.

### Gold Bonds Begin to Be Issued; More Than 800 Taels Sold Yesterday; 52,250 Yuan Per Tael

[Report from Our Newspaper] The 38-year Short-Term Gold Public Bonds were started to be sold by the Central Bank yesterday. The selling price is based on the foreign exchange transfer certificates and market prices, and the quotations are listed daily by the Open Market Committee. Yesterday's price was 52,252 yuan per tael. This public price is divided into five types according to the face value: one tael, five mace, one tael, five taels, two taels, ten taels, five middle taels, and five taels. Currently, pre-sale vouchers are issued first, and then exchanged after the Ministry of Finance issues the price vouchers. In addition to the National Treasury Bureau of the National Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the China Trust Bureau are also entrusted to sell them at the same time. Yesterday, more than 800 taels were sold in the city in one day. As for the date of sale in other cities, it has not yet been decided.

### Overall Loosening of Credit

Foreign Exchange Certificates Once Surpassed the Thousand Yuan Mark

Banking and financial sources revealed that the city's money supply increased significantly yesterday due to the large-scale distribution of military pay, which was supplied to foreign countries. The influx of northern capital was also a contributing factor. At present, the total amount of floating capital in the city has always been maintained above 5 billion yuan, and it is almost impossible to withdraw it.

Yesterday, the credit in the city turned loose across the board. Industries were able to circulate easily due to the influx of orders. The transactions in the vegetable and rice industries were particularly frequent. The interbank lending rate fell to 40 to 50 yuan per thousand yuan per day, and the loosening trend became more obvious near noon.

Yesterday, the Central Bank continued to work as usual, and the withdrawal of cash became normal, and there were fewer restrictions by the banks, so the situation was stable and flat. It is said that a large number of gold yuan currency from the north has been flowing south in recent days, so there is a phenomenon that the cash outside the industry is more abundant than that inside the industry.

Yesterday morning, the foreign exchange transfer certificate market opened strong, mainly stimulated by the black market price, which has surpassed the thousand yuan mark. Later, the market price softened slightly due to the Central Bank's strong selling at high prices. In addition, the interbank credit turned tighter, and the commercial designated bank in the afternoon market bid 960 yuan and offered 980 yuan, up 90 yuan from yesterday.

### Cotton Yarn Rises; Cloth Prices Unanimously Rise

At the beginning of the yarn market, it was heard that financial items had soared, and the tight credit situation in the city had eased. People's hearts turned high, and the purchase by local customers was still smooth. Floating orders also came to make up for the losses. The situation was quite prosperous. At the time of closing, there were many distributions, and pressure sales came at high prices. The final decline was slight, but it was still more than 15% higher than before.

### Fuel Prices Soar

Since the beginning of the Lunar New Year, various types of local bituminous and anthracite coal have experienced a frenzied surge in prices, with all grades reaching unprecedented peaks. Factories of all sizes, public utilities, and citizens of both rich and poor are all facing severe threats. A reporter from the Commercial Press, after inquiring with those familiar with the coal market yesterday, learned that the soaring prices of bituminous and anthracite coal per catty were purely man-made. It is said that some large households have repeatedly used old tricks, creating rumors and mischief, or even manipulating and monopolizing the market to raise prices and seek profits, resulting in a reduction in the supply of spot goods in the market, causing people to be anxious, and ultimately the market price being illegally raised. The reporter also learned from another source that although the source of bituminous and anthracite coal catty has been slightly blocked, the inventory in this city is still abundant and there has been no shortage. Moreover, factories and users have tried to save on expenses due to high market prices, so the amount of fuel consumption has also been reduced. Therefore, the high cost of coal is purely an illegal price increase, and the future is really unimaginable.

According to the Four Mines Joint Operating Office: yesterday, the price of bituminous coal was adjusted again. The price list is as follows: domestic bituminous coal is 15,500 yuan per ton, and foreign bituminous coal has dropped alone, at 28,593 yuan per ton, a decrease of 953 yuan compared to the previous time. Anthracite coal nuggets and small pieces are both 27,000 yuan per ton. Anthracite coal lumps are 36,000 yuan per ton, and anthracite coal dross is 19,000 yuan per ton. The above are all delivery prices at the Pudong wharf. Delivery at the Puxi Maigen Road coal yard requires an additional 900 yuan per ton.
