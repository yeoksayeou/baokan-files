### Full Text of the Control Yuan's Declaration

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The entire body of Control Yuan members convened on the 11th and revised and passed a declaration calling for peace. The full text is as follows: The peace that the people of the whole country unanimously expect has already shown a glimmer of hope since the President's New Year's Day message this year. However, as the situation has evolved to this day, it is still wavering in a stage of indecision between peace and war, which is extremely worrying. We, the members of the Control Yuan, entrusted by the people, cannot but frankly and sincerely inform the people of the country of the advantages, disadvantages, and the essence of striving for peace at this critical juncture.

The eight-year War of Resistance against Japan has severely damaged the country's vitality. After victory, wars and disasters have resumed, with corpses lying across the fields, and those rolling in ravines are even more numerous. This kind of tragic sacrifice of lives is an irreparable loss for our Chinese nation. At the same time, in the economic aspect, fields are barren, rural areas are bankrupt, transportation is cut off, and industry and commerce are萎缩, all production forces are in a state of standstill and collapse. If this continues, it will fundamentally destroy the livelihood of the Chinese nation and its future generations. We have personally experienced the evil consequences of this war and are heartbroken by it. The people of the whole country really cannot endure it any longer, nor can they continue to endure it. Therefore, we urgently call on you to abandon war, cease fire on the spot, and seek peace for the sake of the country, the people, and future generations.

The Three Principles of the People, created by Sun Yat-sen, are the founding principles of our country. This has long been recognized by the people of the whole country and jointly recognized by parties during the Political Consultative Conference era. However, the implementation of these principles must be based on peace and can never be resolved through war. Moreover, war is the root of disaster, not only can it not solve the various problems of the country and society, but it also increases the severity of various problems. Just look at the various measures of the government today, which are棘手 everywhere, and the suffering of the people is deepening day by day. In the Communist-occupied areas, the people are also exhausted and impoverished. None of them can solve the problems of the people. Moreover, even if military victory can seize a city or a place, the evil consequences of war only increase the suffering of the people and lose the hearts of the people. Therefore, the real victory should consider how to win the hearts of the people and how to realize the peace that the people of the whole country unanimously and earnestly hope for. Relying on force cannot achieve the goal.

President Chiang's message clearly stated that everything is based on the interests of the country, regardless of personal advancement or retreat. This frank attitude is truly admirable. However, the realization of peace cannot place all the responsibility on one party or one person. Therefore, we hope that the leaders in the government must all emulate President Chiang's spirit of humility and dedication to the country, abandon prejudices, and strive for peace. At the same time, we also ask the leaders of the Communist Party to have the same broad-mindedness, prioritize the people, cease fire and make peace. Once peace is realized, we further advocate that everyone relinquish their own rights and positions to thank the people.

We, the members of the Control Yuan, respectfully oversee the laws and regulations, and deeply regret that our talents and virtues are meager and cannot help overcome the difficulties of the times. If peace can be realized at an early date, we are also eager to follow in the footsteps of all gentlemen and retire and recommend virtuous and capable people.

The 20th century is the century of the people, and the people are the masters of the country. The political affairs of the country should be decided by the people. We, the people, should no longer endure the oppression of a few people and be their slaves, nor should we be driven by warmongers and be their cannon fodder. Since the government has spoken out for the people and expressed its willingness to cease fire and make peace, if the Communist Party values the people's livelihood, there is no reason to wage war again. We demand life and do not allow the exploitation of corrupt officials and corrupt bureaucrats. We demand freedom and survival and do not allow the threats of terror and cruel wars to exist again. At this time when the call for peace fills the universe, we must call for peace on the one hand and strengthen unity and strengthen our own strength on the other hand to strive for peace and protect peace.

The Qiu and Li Corps and part of the Sun Corps, about 12 armies, took the initiative to withdraw from Xuzhou on December 3 last year. Along the way, they eliminated the resistance of the Communist bandits. On the 6th, the National Army advanced to the central area between Qinglongji in the east of Yongcheng, Suixikou, and Zhao Jiaji. They were repeatedly surrounded by superior bandits.

It is learned that two columns of the Liu Bocheng 部隊, who are good at the car wheel warfare method, have moved west and north from the Gu town stronghold of the Jinpu Railway and预佈狙击栈 in the Mengcheng area.

### No New Developments in International Mediation; Our Government Awaits Reply; Envoys of Four Powers Also Await Instructions from Their Home Countries

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] Regarding the international mediation of our domestic disputes to promote peace, there were no new developments on the 11th. Our government is awaiting the reply from the four countries, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, to the memorandum submitted by Foreign Minister兼 (concurrently) Wu on the 8th. The envoys of the four countries are also waiting for instructions from their respective governments. Figures in diplomatic circles are maintaining extreme silence on this matter, offering no comments or speculations. [United Press, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] According to reliable sources confirmed on the 11th, none of the four powers has yet responded to China's request for mediation. Qualified observers predict that the responses from the United States, the United Kingdom, and France will be favorable to the government, but the Soviet Union is a major question. It is pointed out that without the assistance of the Soviet Union, contact with the Communists is almost impossible. It is still unknown whether China has requested the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to use their diplomatic influence to urge the Soviet Union to participate in the mediation.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 11th Dispatch] The diplomatic correspondent of the London Times reports that the Chinese government's call for the four powers, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, to mediate the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communists to promote peace is now being considered sympathetically by various countries. However, the immediate reaction in diplomatic circles here is that unless the Soviet Union, which seems unlikely to participate, joins the mediation, foreign mediation seems unlikely to persuade the Communists, who are militarily dominant, to hold negotiations with the National Government. Considering Marshall's past experience, diplomatic circles here are highly skeptical whether foreign mediators are qualified to find a basis for negotiations between the two sides.

### Current Prices

Under the repeated mistakes of the gold exchange policy, Shanghai prices have soared to unprecedented peaks, especially the sharp rise in the prices of rice, yarn, oil, and coal, which heavily oppresses everyone. In order to curb this rising trend, the financial authorities and the central bank authorities took emergency measures on the 11th, on the one hand, lowering the gold equalization fee by 500 yuan, and on the other hand, throwing out a large amount of materials, so yesterday's prices slightly turned back to fall, ranging from 10% to 20-30%. This is just a setback in the mad price surge, not a natural decline, and the future situation is still worrying.

The rise in Shanghai prices is no longer surprising news, it has become an inevitable phenomenon of the social economy. However, in addition to the two main causes of war and inflation, other factors are not the same for each price increase, nor are they completely the same, and these factors often lead to the most frantic rise. Recently, prices have repeatedly hit peaks, with the rise in daily necessities being the most violent, rather than a general rise in all kinds of goods. Naturally, other kinds of goods are also affected by the rise and soar. According to the third survey of the cost of living index in this month's previous issue on the 11th, prices have risen by another 30-40% since the second survey. Comparing the results with the previous two surveys, it should be one times the previous issue's index. For example, rice has risen by 120%, oil has risen by 130%, yarn has risen by 100%, coal has risen by 200%, and water and electricity have risen to one and a half times. Only the rise in rent and other items is still less than one times. This shows that in this price surge in Shanghai, only a few people have gained profits, while the majority of honest and hardworking people are still suffering from the heavy high pressure of life, living a life of famine, terror, and chaos.

In summary, there are about four factors causing this soaring price rise: First, it is the authorities' mishandling of the gold exchange policy, especially after the gold equalization fee was added, which stimulated the rise in prices. The gold equalization fee is almost the same as the black market, and speculators continue to swallow it, so a new black market has emerged, which has a significant impact on prices; Second, the circular expansion of inflation and fiscal deficits has ruthlessly stimulated prices. The government's only financial weapon now is the issuance of currency. In short, inflation leads to high prices, high prices lead to an increasingly large fiscal deficit, and an increasingly large fiscal deficit requires the issuance of a larger number of currency. This continues in a cycle, which will directly promote a wider range of price increases and make the upward trend of prices more uncontrollable. This is the fundamental reason for the soaring prices in recent years, and this trend has become more intense recently; Third, the prevalence of hoarding stimulates prices. When people experience that the purchasing power of gold yuan coupons is constantly decreasing, they develop a mentality of "valuing goods more than currency," so as soon as they have cash in hand, they immediately use it to buy goods. Most of them are indeed daily necessities such as rice, coal, oil, and yarn, but there are also many who use this to preserve the value of their property. As a result, there is an increasing shortage of goods in the market. At the same time, the habit of immediately using cash to buy goods as soon as it is in hand has greatly increased the circulation speed of gold yuan coupons. The current price increase of several times a day without falling is due to the excessive and rapid circulation speed of gold yuan coupons; Fourth, the turbulent and unstable war situation and political situation have led to a shortage of some rice and coal sources in the interior, which are all reasons for deepening the chaos and flooding of price changes.

Based on the above four factors that cause the soaring price phenomenon, the development trend will be a very serious matter. To curb this vicious surge, or to eradicate this surge, the only way is to achieve domestic peace. In fact, only peace can save human suffering. This is the fundamental way to clarify the current socio-economic problems. Passive and superficial methods, such as the measures currently taken by the central bank, such as lowering the gold equalization fee, or drastically tightening credit, or throwing out materials in a planned way, may depress prices to rebound, but it is impossible to completely fall. It only shows a temporary expansion and contraction of prices. Therefore, we are not optimistic about the future of prices, which are currently in a state of large increases and small declines.

### The Executive Yuan Is Actively Planning to Store Three Months' Worth of Grain in Six Major Cities; The Storage in Nanjing and Shanghai Is Still Less Than Half

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] According to the Grain News Agency: The Executive Yuan is actively planning a plan to store three months' worth of grain in six major cities: Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Guangzhou. Due to transportation difficulties, it is difficult to achieve in Peiping and Tianjin. In the other four cities, the Emergency Grain Storage and Purchase Committee and the local municipal governments will each be responsible for half of the predetermined amount. The funds required for purchase and storage will be lent by the central bank. According to reliable sources, Shanghai needs to store more than 1.7 million dan of grain for three months, and Nanjing needs to store 366,000 dan. As of now, Nanjing has stored 140,000 dan, and Shanghai has stored 414,000 dan, which is less than half of the predetermined target. Whose responsibility it is remains to be investigated.

### Distribution of Civilian Food in Qingdao; Inferior Quality and Adulteration Discovered; Whose Responsibility It Is Remains to Be Investigated

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 11th Dispatch] In the distribution of civilian food in Qingdao, a large batch of inferior and adulterated products was discovered. The flour was like fried rice flour and was inedible, causing an uproar in the city. It was found that the ECA allocated 9,000 tons of wheat to Qingdao and signed contracts with Shuangfu and Qilu companies to grind it into finished products, which were then controlled by the ECA and allocated to the Civil Affairs Association for distribution. Reports say that the fraudulent flour was produced by Qilu Company, which apparently mixed in a large amount of yuan wheat and water. The person in charge of the Civil Affairs Association said that the association's responsibility was only in distribution and had no right to inspect. The person in charge of Qilu Company's flour mill claimed that it was caused by a machine malfunction, but since the ECA had already inspected it, there should be no problem. This matter will obviously threaten the credibility of the ECA. Hawkins, the 28-year-old person in charge of the ECA here, will also find it thorny. Whose responsibility it is remains to be investigated.

### Chennault Is Willing to Lead If a Volunteer American Air Force Is Organized; Believes That China's Current War Is a Civil War

[United Press, Local Dispatch] General Chennault, the famous leader of the "Flying Tigers" during the War of Resistance, reiterated today his willingness to lead an American volunteer team to fight for the Chinese government, and said that this move could still be effective, but the team must have proper organization and supply, and cooperate with the Chinese Air Force. The proposal to organize a new volunteer team was made several weeks ago. Some former members of the US 14th Air Force volunteered to return to China and suggested that Chen lead them. Although this matter has aroused support and opposition, Washington officials have not expressed any opinion. According to Chen's conversation with reporters, President Chiang has not asked him to organize a new volunteer team. Although he had notified the President of the willingness of former members of the 14th Air Force to serve, he has not received a reply. He believes that the current war in China is not a civil war, but a war between communism and everything that is not communist. The majority of Chinese who oppose communism will welcome a new American volunteer team; those who are inclined to communism will oppose it, but he knows that most Chinese are opposed to communism. Some observers criticize that the Chinese Air Force does not fight, or is not enthusiastic about fighting. He does not agree with this. The Chinese Air Force has been trained to fight enemy air forces, but has not been trained to assist ground operations or attack ground targets, but its performance is also quite good. Chen is unwilling to predict what the fate of the China National Aviation Corporation, which has occupied the entire mainland, will be, but he said that he does not hope to continue operating in China under the control of the Communist Party.

### Nanjing Memorial Meeting for Cai Yuanpei's Birthday; Hu Shi Speaks on the History of the Annotation of the Waterways Classic

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] Today is the 82nd anniversary of the birth of Mr. Cai Yuanpei, the former president of Peking University and the founder of Academia Sinica. The Nanjing Peking University Alumni Association and colleagues from Academia Sinica held a memorial meeting at 10:00 am at No. 1 Jiming Temple. Zhu Jiahua, the chairman, said briefly that Mr. Cai was not only the founder of the new culture, but also the pioneer of new political thought. His spirit of loving truth, safeguarding freedom, promoting democracy, and promoting science will always be a model for the world. Those who participated in the grand event today included Wang Chonghui, Wang Shijie, Shen Shiyuan, Di Ying, Li Shuhua, Fu Sinian, Chen Xueping, Yang Zhongjian, Hang Liwu, and others, totaling more than 300 people. Then, Hu Shi gave a lecture on "A Brief History of the Annotation of the Waterways Classic in the Past Four Hundred Years." The main points of Hu's speech are as follows: The original text of the Waterways Classic is only a few thousand words, and it was drafted around the Eastern Han Dynasty and completed in the Three Kingdoms period, with a total of 137 entries, of which 123 are still extant. During the Northern Wei Dynasty, Li Daoyuan wrote the Annotation of the Waterways Classic. He personally traveled to all the waterways in the north, so he was able to collect detailed information. For the waterways in the south, he fully utilized the books published in the south at that time as reference. The book was completed with 345,000 words, becoming a great work. During the Song Dynasty, two editions were circulated in Chengdu, Sichuan, but there were many omissions and errors, and the classic and the annotation were mixed together, making it difficult for researchers to start. The Huang's edition in the Ming Dynasty not only had some collations, but also had missing pages. Even only half of Li Daoyuan's original preface remained. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Zhu Maobu of the imperial family re-engraved it in the 43rd year of Wanli, correcting many errors. During the Qing Dynasty, when compiling the Comprehensive Geography of the Qing Dynasty, Gu Zuyu and Huang Yi used scientific tools such as maps and scientific methods to make the study of the Annotation of the Waterways Classic enter a new stage. Speaking of the history of the annotation of the Waterways Classic in the past four hundred years, Hu especially praised the great contributions of Dai Dongyuan and Quan Zuwang, saying that they actually came to the same conclusion by different routes and there was no mutual plagiarism at all. Duan Yucai, Wang Guowei, and Meng Sen, etc., had lengthy written lawsuits for this, which was emotional and could not be done with a calm and objective attitude. Finally, Hu reported on the process of annotating the Waterways Classic. He had been working on it for five years since 1943, and it is now coming to an end. Recently, Peking University held its 50th anniversary celebration and exhibited more than 70 versions of the Waterways Classic, including the most precious Yongle Encyclopedia edition.

### Ministry of National Defense Promulgates "Measures for Establishing Conscription Teams and Military Service Mutual Aid Groups During the Suppression of Rebellion Period"

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Ministry of National Defense, in order to meet the military needs of suppressing the rebellion, previously drafted and promulgated the Essentials of Conscription During the Rebellion Period. Now, in order to protect the livelihoods of the families of soldiers who have gone to war, and to cooperate with local people's self-defense training, so as to strengthen county-level conscription work, the Ministry has separately formulated and promulgated "Measures for Establishing Conscription Teams and Military Service Mutual Aid Groups in Each County (City) During the Suppression of Rebellion Period." These measures will be implemented uniformly across the country on January 13th. These measures are the most basic of the basic work of military service. The full text is recorded as follows: (A) General Principles

1.  These measures are formulated in accordance with Article 7, Page 9 of the Supplementary Measures to the Regulations on the Organization and Training of People's Self-Defense Teams, and Articles 3, 6, and 17 of the Essentials of Conscription During the Suppression of Rebellion Period.

2.  In order to strengthen county-level conscription work and maintain the livelihoods of the families of soldiers who have gone to war, each county (city) should immediately establish conscription teams and military service mutual aid groups in order to balance rights and obligations. (B) Organization and Management of Conscription Teams 3. Conscription teams in each township (town/district) should be organized from able-bodied men aged 20 to 25 who pass the physical examination. The organization should be done once every year at the beginning of the year. The following year, new men who have reached the age of 20 should be added, and those who have reached the age of 26 should be removed. 4. Conscription teams, in preparation for conscription, should be organized at the beginning of each year in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the Essentials of Conscription During the Rebellion Period, according to the principle of the number of family members in each team member's household, pre-dividing them into two types: priority team members and reserve team members. After the priority team members are conscripted, reserve team members will be selected to fill the vacancies. The priority team members must always maintain a number equal to 1% of the total population of the common township (town/district). When conscripted into the army, reserve team members must be immediately selected to fill the quota. If the reserve team members cannot meet the quota after selection according to regulations, the age limit may be extended. The age limit for such extension shall be determined by the provinces (cities) after obtaining approval through an order. The selection and replacement of the aforementioned priority team members shall be carried out in accordance with Article 10 of these Measures, proposed by the third subgroup of each Jia, and convened by the Bao chief to convene the subgroups of each Jia under their jurisdiction, jointly reviewing and selecting them. 5. Each township (town/district) should organize one conscription team, with each Bao forming one detachment, and each detachment forming several groups. Each group should be formed on average with one priority team member and several reserve team members. Jias without priority team members should be combined with neighboring Jias.

Each team and detachment shall have one team leader and one deputy team leader, concurrently held by the township (town/district) Bao chief and the township (town/district) Bao deputy team leader. The group leader shall be publicly elected from among the reserve team members. The team leaders and deputy team leaders at all levels shall be appointed by the county (city) People's Self-Defense Headquarters and reported to the county (city) government for record. After the conscription teams are organized, the township (town/district) shall, taking the Bao as the unit, announce them according to group and the order of priority team members and reserve team members. 6. The team leaders and deputy team leaders at all levels of the conscription team shall be responsible for investigating, organizing, controlling, training, encouraging, and supervising the conscription team members. Once a conscription order is received from the county (city), they shall immediately select and conscript according to the prescribed number from the priority team members in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the Essentials of Conscription, and if required, concentrate and escort them to the county (city) conscription office. 7. The priority team members of the conscription team should be prepared for conscription at any time and should not leave the township (town/district) without authorization. The reserve team members of the group shall be the legally responsible guarantors. If reserve team members leave the township (town/district) for any reason, they must report to and obtain approval from the Bao chief to which they belong, and obtain a written guarantee from two or more reserve team members of the same group, and submit it to the township (town/district) office for the issuance of an exit permit. Any priority team member who leaves the township without authorization, and any reserve team member who leaves the township without reporting for approval, shall be dealt with in accordance with Article 8 of the Statute for Punishing Offenses Against Military Service. Before the unauthorized priority team members who left the territory are arrested and brought to justice, one person from the reserve team members of the group shall be selected to make up for the vacancy. If counties (cities) (townships) (towns/districts) find any conscription team members entering the territory without an exit permit, they may be required to serve in the military and be allowed to fill the quota.

8. Each township (town/district) conscription team should create three copies of the roster, one for its own safekeeping, and the other two submitted to the county (city) government to which it belongs for approval. One copy will be kept by the county (city) government, and one copy will be handed over to the People's Self-Defense Headquarters for safekeeping and use. In addition to the above-mentioned listing, priority team members must also create a register of men of age for active duty in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the Conscription Processing Rules. Reserve team members are exempt from creating the register. 9. If local financial resources permit, priority team members may be concentrated for training in the township (town/district) first. If this is not possible, they should be trained regularly without interrupting production. Reserve team members only need to be registered and controlled, and do not need to be trained. (To be continued)

[United Press, Lake Success, 11th] Countries opposed to colonialism pressed the United States on the 11th to support their motion to have the United Nations order Dutch troops to withdraw from the territory they have occupied in the Indonesian Republic.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 11th] The property left by Tojo to his family at the time of his death was only worth 300,000 yen, or approximately US$1,000.

The British Foreign Office disclosed that Britain is currently maintaining constant contact with the United States on the situation. In Washington, State Department spokesman McDermott said that the Department had received "intelligence" from Britain and Israel regarding the aircraft incident.

[United Press, Lake Success, 10th] Israeli Representative Eban, who arrived here from Tel Aviv, condemned Britain's "inflammatory exercises," which are endangering the ceasefire negotiations. In a statement, Eban said that Britain should be held responsible for rejecting a United Nations ceasefire in Palestine, thus obstructing the ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Egypt. Eban's statement was issued after UN Secretary-General Lie urged Britain and Israel to resolve the dispute caused by the downing of five British aircraft by Jewish forces on the 7th in a moderate manner. United Nations officials also revealed that Lie had discussed the serious situation between Britain and Israel with U.S. officials. It is understood that Lie urged the United States to do its utmost to dissuade the two governments from bringing the dispute to the Security Council.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 10th] According to a Times correspondent in Tel Aviv, the Soviet Union will assist Israel in the Security Council, but so far, there is no evidence that the Soviet Union has dared to provide Israel with military assistance, or that the Soviet Union has any political activities infiltrating Israel. The Soviet Union's influence in Israel can be said to be almost zero.

The U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union and France will be replaced.

### Various Agencies Decide to Publicly Announce that Grain Ration Prices Will Be Adjusted at Any Time; The Purpose Is to Prevent Famine and Ensure Rice Revenue for Continued Operations

The American Economic Cooperation Administration's U.S. Aid Utilization Committee recently announced a new method for setting the prices of rationed grain. According to this method, the prices of rationed rice and flour in major cities may be adjusted within the month. The procedure is to review the rationed rice price every two days or every two weeks. If the difference with the open market price is too large, a new price must be set. The above method was decided after a long period of discussion by the agencies involved. Participants in the meeting included the Economic Coordination Committee of the Executive Yuan, the Grain Emergency Purchase and Storage Committee, the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee of the Executive Yuan, and the American Economic Cooperation Administration, which has long advocated the adoption of this new method. The implementation of the above-mentioned new method aims to ensure rice revenue for continued food purchases and maintenance of the rationing system. If the prices cannot be adjusted at any time, the government subsidies will increase, and it will not be able to continue purchasing food domestically or abroad to maintain the rationing system. The result will be food shortages in the cities. Under the current rationing plan, the Chinese government is responsible for purchasing 60% of the food required for rationing, and the remaining amount is supplied by the American Economic Cooperation Administration. In the future, the adjustment of food prices in each rationed city must be decided after careful consultation and deliberation by the Grain Emergency Purchase and Storage Committee, the Economic Coordination Committee of the Executive Yuan, the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee, and the Economic Cooperation Administration. This decision must also be fully reviewed and discussed with representatives of the People's Congress of each city, as well as the local food department, the U.S. Aid Committee, and the Economic Cooperation Administration. The actual reasons for implementing the new pricing method are summarized as follows: (1) If the ration price is too low, the urban people will enjoy undue benefits compared to the general people who have to pay the open market price. (2) If the ration price is very low, farmers will not be willing to sell rice to the city. This situation may cause food shortages, as happened in some rationed cities last fall.

The above-mentioned new method has already been implemented in other rationed cities such as Guangzhou, Qingdao, and Shantou.

### Western Films May Disappear Again: Employees of Eight Foreign Film Companies Go on Strike Over Treatment

[Our Report] All Chinese employees of eight foreign film companies in the city recently began a full-scale strike because their demands to the management for adjustments to their treatment have not been met. The Shanghai Film Industry Workers Union also invited reporters to Kang Fan for this purpose. Song Weimin, the executive director of the Union, and Fang Zemin, the representative of the Chinese employees of the foreign film companies, reported on the process, stating that the current treatment of Chinese employees by foreign film companies is extremely unreasonable. The salaries of foreign employees are calculated in US dollars, and each person can receive more than 50,000 yuan per month, while Chinese employees are paid in Gold Yuan, and their income is only one-sixtieth of that of foreign employees. Therefore, in November of last year, they jointly submitted four requests to the management: (1) Increase salaries by 100%. (2) Restore the monthly rice subsidy for each person. (3) The dismissal of Chinese employees must be handled in accordance with Chinese laws. (4) If the company intends to relocate, it should pay severance pay. After this request was submitted, the management never paid any attention to it. Subsequently, the Social Affairs Bureau stepped in to mediate, but the management requested to handle it themselves. Then, representatives of both labor and management negotiated once, and the management only agreed to increase the salaries of Chinese employees by 40%, while the labor side insisted on the original conditions, resulting in a stalemate. The Film Industry Workers Union stated that if the strike by Chinese employees of foreign film companies cannot be resolved reasonably in the near future, it may lead to two consequences: (1) New Western films that are expected to be released will not be able to be shown in the city in the short term. (2) All projection technicians belonging to the Workers Union will support their position and demand that all cinemas withdraw Western films currently being shown and replace them with domestic films.

### New Director of Statistics: Chu Fei Takes Office, Advocates Self-Compilation of Indices for Various Industries to Meet Travel and Emotional Needs, and Publishes "Creed" and "Goals" in Writing

[Our Report] Chu Yifei, the new director of the Municipal Statistics Office, officially assumed office at 10:30 AM yesterday without holding an inauguration ceremony. The seal was directly handed over by the former director Zhang Zongmeng, and Mayor Wu specially appointed Min Xiangfan, the chief accountant of the Municipal Government, to supervise the handover. Director Chu told reporters that the current method of calculating the cost of living index will remain the same, but he is considering changing the method of compiling indices in the future to make it more perfect and accurate, and he plans to convene a meeting of statisticians in the office to study and then propose it to the mayor. Chu also believes that in order to adapt to environmental needs, the compilation of welfare indices by various industries should be promoted. Because the percentage of wages in the production cost of various industries varies, if indices can be compiled according to the actual living needs of workers in various industries and salaries can be adjusted at any time according to the price increase of various products, it will be more reasonable for both labor and management. It is reported that Chu was formerly the director of the Statistics Office of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, graduated from the Paris Institute of Statistics, and served as a professor at the Central Political School and Law School. His appointment as the head of the Municipal Statistics Office will surely make a contribution. Chu published a written "Creed" and "Goals" yesterday.

### Coal Supply Difficulties, Insufficient Supply: Efforts to Dredge Taiwan Coal Supply, Urging Utilities to Conserve

According to Xiong Daji, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Coal Regulation Committee: Recently, due to traffic congestion, the only source of coal depends on Taiwan. However, so far, only over 2,400 tons of Taiwan coal have been shipped to Shanghai, in addition to over 30,000 tons from the Soviet Union and 9,000 tons from the United States.

### Authorities Sell Off Materials and Tighten Credit: Prices Fell Across the Board Yesterday; National Bank Notifies All Branches to Tighten Remittance Business

[Reported by this newspaper] Credit tightened in Shanghai yesterday, and the interest rate for overnight loans rose. The highest overnight rate was 100 yuan per 10 yuan, and the ordinary rate also reached 70 yuan per 10 yuan. Due to tight funds, banks rarely lent out, making it difficult for the market to circulate funds. Cash funds are even more scarce. Due to the tightening of credit, prices of various commodities in the market fell across the board. In order to reduce the concentration of floating capital, in addition to notifying all national banks to tighten remittance business, the National Bank has also recovered 120 million yuan of settlement funds for yarn and sugar, and will tighten credit in the near future to curb the wind. In addition, the Gold Management Bureau and the Police Bureau sent personnel to various markets yesterday morning to monitor price gouging.

The Bank of China yesterday announced the remittance limits for various regions across the country as follows: (1) Limited to 100 yuan: Zunyi, Anshun, Duyun, Kaiyuan, Xiaguan. (2) Limited to 500 yuan: Yichang, Weinan, Nanzheng, Sanyuan, and various remittance branches in Guangdong Province. (3) Limited to 1,000 yuan: Danyang, Yangzhou, Anqing, Wenzhou. Also reported: Credit tightened and prices generally declined in recent days. According to the负责人 of the Gold Management Bureau, Shanghai has always been a speculative market, resulting in rapid price increases and decreases. This time, the skyrocketing prices were unreasonable. As soon as the government took special measures, the market changed suddenly. From now on, legitimate businessmen must not follow the trend and get caught up in the whirlpool. It is also learned that due to the tightening of credit in recent days, the black market interest rate has risen sharply, as high as one yuan. Industry and commerce have been greatly threatened. The production loans organized by the Central Bank's discount loan meeting will be reviewed more leniently due to changes in the financial market, so that various manufacturers can overcome difficulties and maintain production.

Since prices have been rising for days, all parties felt a lack of orders. Yesterday, credit was unusually tight, and the black market interest rate jumped from 70 yuan to 100 yuan. Cash funds were scarce due to outflow, and the needs of various industries were high, so the panic was even greater. The situation of bounced checks from banks has increased significantly due to the tight funds of all parties. The commodity market experienced a sharp drop in prices yesterday morning. In the afternoon, remittances from other ports continued to arrive in Shanghai, and supply and demand tended to balance. Lending slightly eased, and off-exchange prices also rebounded. Yesterday, the Central Bank lowered the price of gold for spot exchange by 500 yuan to 6,500 yuan, with an additional 8,500 yuan for spot exchange fees. The black market price of gold notes also softened. In the afternoon, the black market trading of gold gradually revolved upstream due to the spot settlement the next day. Compared with the market on the previous day, it was a large rise with a small setback. In addition, the prices of yarn and cloth fell across the board. Cigarettes, daily necessities, and Western medicines all fell by 20-30%. The securities market started spot settlement the next day yesterday, and the market showed a sluggish state. Yong yarn once fell to 16,500 yuan, and then rebounded to 19,000 yuan. Taiwan sugar continued to decline due to the further reduction of the Taiwan exchange rate. The off-exchange rate was 600 yuan, and there was still absorption.

### ### China Textile Mass Sales: Yesterday's Yarn and Cloth Market Declined

In addition, 72 pieces of 20-count Jin Shuang Hui were sold on behalf of the Bank of China for 43,000 yuan, totaling 3,096,000 yuan.

The yarn market was generally tightening, and the outside market was also blocked. People were disoriented, short sellers were active, long sellers were unable to pull up prices, and sales were continuous. All yarns went downstream. At the beginning of the morning, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was sold by colleagues, and customers also sold out. The selling pressure was fierce, opening at a low of 67,000 yuan. Later, there were still buyers absorbing at low prices, and the price reached a high of 80,000 yuan.

Each grade of 20-count only fell by 1,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan, and each grade below 16-count fell within 4,000 yuan.

Cotton cloth fell across the board. It was rumored that the authorities continued to sell off materials to tighten funds, so credit in the market was generally tightened, and goods outside the market were also forced to fall. Many customers sold off their remaining balances because remittances could not arrive in time, and many colleagues closed out. Dye factories rarely entered or exited, and the market fell in a straight line. Dragon Head fine cloth fell from 1,900 yuan to 1,810 yuan. The closing price fell again to 1,700 yuan. Actual transactions were not many. Trumpet Boy fine cloth opened at a high of 1,770 yuan in the morning, but no one bought it until the closing price, but there were also few sales. Five Fortune fine cloth still lacked supply. Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge opened at 1,770 yuan and then fell all the way to 1,600 yuan, a drop of 380 yuan from the previous day. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong fell by 340 yuan, ending at 1,740 yuan. Although the remaining cloth factory prices opened small, they were only about 200 yuan lower than before because the prices of fuel, pigments, etc. were all skyrocketing.

### ### Tight Credit and Product Reports: Rice, Flour, and Oil Prices All Fell

The early market was the most sluggish, and prices fell by 200-300 yuan. Subsequently, the rice shops absorbed at low prices, and then rebounded by 100 yuan, resulting in a drop of 150-200 yuan.

Bingchuan flour also fell by 42 yuan, with a closing price of 438 yuan. Hongfeng and Jiancheng each fell by 47-48 yuan. The later market seemed to have stabilized. Large bags of bran fell by 34-35 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

All were small, because the closing price on the previous day was already down. Yesterday, credit was still tight, and rice prices also fell, so they continued to fall. However, the closing price of soybeans was slightly higher because the price of oil fell less. Broad beans did not open. Car beans were 830 yuan, which was 150 yuan lower than the previous day. The price of corn was high and thought to be dangerous, so owners frequently sold, falling rapidly by 250-300 yuan. Red grains also fell by more than 200 yuan, green beans fell by 200 yuan, and selected green fell by more than 100 yuan. Sesame seeds generally fell by 300 yuan. Raw peanuts were not accepted by the Guang merchants, and the decline was the most severe, falling sharply by 1,000 yuan.

Edible Oil

The ups and downs were sudden. The opening price fell sharply. In the middle market, the local street absorbed, and prices rose again. The closing price was weak again. The opening price of bean oil in the store was 3,800 yuan, and then rebounded to 4,300 yuan. The closing price was weak to 4,150 yuan, a drop of 150 yuan. The closing price of raw vegetable oil was 3,950 yuan, a drop of 200 yuan. The closing price of raw oil in Jiton was still 4,700 yuan, and the price was uniquely stable. Bean cake first fell and then slightly rose, a drop of 20-30 yuan.

### ### Tea Prices Continue to Soar

Yesterday's tea market, although the credit of colleagues was tight and various goods outside the market plummeted, the goods party still increased sharply due to the steep increase in public utilities and the continuous stepping of the replication cost. In addition, the tea stock was as thin as spring ice, so the attitude became more defensive, and the asking price continued to soar, so the trend showed a special show, and the market was still like a runaway wild horse, advancing rapidly again. However, there were still not many buyers, so only a few transactions were made.

### ### Foreign Exchange Certificates Fell Back and Overseas Remittances Remained Unchanged

Yesterday, the Central Bank again entrusted the Bank of China to sell a large number of foreign exchange transfer certificates, causing the market price to fall sharply. The highest price yesterday was 185 yuan, the lowest was 160 yuan, and the closing price rebounded slightly to 168 yuan for purchase and 169 yuan for sale, a drop of 16 yuan from the previous day. The exchange rate for overseas remittances remained unchanged at 170 yuan.

### ### Silver and Money Industry Adjusts Interest Rates

The three public associations of the silver, money, and trust industries held a meeting yesterday and jointly decided that starting from the 12th, the daily interest rate for deposits would be changed to 7.5 yuan per 1,000 yuan, the daily interest rate for inter-bank loans would be changed to 24 yuan per 1,000 yuan, and the daily interest rate for loans would be changed to 30 yuan per 1,000 yuan.

### ### Taiwan Sugar Continues to Fall

Yesterday's sugar market was generally down because prices of all goods were falling back, people's hearts were also weak, credit was tightening, floating capital in the industry was transferred elsewhere, and scattered households stopped absorbing and turned to selling, and the intention to sell was very urgent. The local merchants saw that the overall situation was weak and sales were also sluggish. The noon closing price of No. 45 car white essence was 3,100 yuan, which was a continuous drop of 300 yuan. The prices of other grades fell by about 10% across the board.

### ### Commercial Briefs

Rubber factory prices were adjusted again yesterday due to the sharp rise in raw materials, and prices were generally increased by 50%. However, the price of rubber shoes in the market fell due to tight credit.

Cigarettes, soaps, and daily necessities softened as soon as the market opened yesterday morning. Suddenly, credit tightened, and there was a chorus of selling in the market, and prices fell in a straight line, generally falling by 20-30%.

Timber stopped advancing yesterday due to the sudden tightening of credit. Except for foreign pine three-ply boards and pine boards, which did not fluctuate, fir strips fell slightly, with large strips selling for 6.5 yuan and small strips selling for 6.4 yuan.

Steel and hardware stabilized as credit in the industry tightened. Steel bars, steel plates, foreign yuan, etc. all remained at their original prices. Only foreign nails remained firm, with coarse patterns opening at 2,000 yuan and fine patterns at 2,200 yuan. Small hardware such as Samsung saw blades and human head sandpaper also entered a stable state, but prices were still firm.

Sea Cucumber and Bird's Nest Market: The price increase was quite fierce. The prices of sea cucumber beards and bird's nest increased by more than 1.5 times. White fungus king rose from 60-100 yuan per tael a week ago to 250 yuan yesterday.

### ### Chamber of Commerce Telephonically Urges Yuan Ministry to Promulgate Supplementary Methods for Capital Conversion

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday, urging the prompt approval and announcement of the methods for changing the registration of the gold yuan conversion of the capital amount of profit-making enterprises. The original telegram stated: The esteemed Nanjing Executive Yuan Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Since the promulgation of the revised methods for issuing gold yuan coupons, the original methods for changing the registration of the gold yuan conversion of the capital amount of profit-making enterprises have become inapplicable. The esteemed Yuan (Ministry), for the sake of expedience, has drafted 11 supplementary articles. Our association was kindly shown a draft by the esteemed Secretary Deng of the Commercial Department of the esteemed Yuan (Ministry), and after briefly expressing our views, we presented them to the esteemed Yuan (Ministry) for adoption. However, the applications for changing the registration are all related to the supplementary methods. If the supplementary methods are delayed by one day, the preparations for industrial and commercial capital change registration will also have no basis, and they can only wait quietly. The determination of the rights and obligations of shareholders is inevitably at a loss, and the calculation of the future registration deadline is also affected. The current 37th year is the time for industrial and commercial final accounts, which is an appropriate opportunity for capital conversion and property valuation. We respectfully request the esteemed Yuan (Ministry) to promptly approve and announce the implementation, which is truly for the public benefit.

### Sweating Your Own Sweat, Eating Your Own Rice: Ningxia Supports Rural Revitalization by Equally Distributing Land So Tillers Own Their Fields and Rationally Utilizing Funds to Adjust the Rural Economy

[Our Ningxia Dispatch, Eighth Day] Ningxia is located in the upper reaches of the Yellow River. Its northern, southern, and central areas consist of plains and flatlands with interconnected fields and crisscrossing canals. The land is fertile, making it suitable for planting rice and wheat, and its products were once known to be abundant. However, the region is vast, and the population is sparse, resulting in extensive barrenness and underutilization of land resources, which is deeply regrettable! As early as the 22nd year (of the Republic), the province established the Provincial Land Reclamation Bureau to plan land affairs, pioneering land administration in the country. In the 25th year, the Provincial Land Administration Bureau was established, completing the surveying and measuring of land in the plains and flatlands in a year and a half. After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the authorities focused on increasing grain production and maintained the lowest grain prices in the country. In terms of land affairs promotion, from the 26th year to the present, a total of 500,000 mu of land has been released, with considerable results. However, according to the authorities' statistics for the 35th year, there are more than 2.3 million mu of cultivable wasteland in the province, and farm households with less than 10 mu of cultivated land account for 45.71% of all farm households. Those with less than 3 mu account for 33.33%. It can be said that 79% of existing farm households do not have enough cultivated land, resulting in a surplus of labor. (According to statistics, the average household in Ningxia has about seven people, and the minimum cultivated area per person is estimated at five mu, so it should be 35 mu to maintain the minimum livelihood of a household.) The occurrence of this phenomenon is due to the deterioration of the land system since the late Qing Dynasty, with people seeking loopholes and officials engaging in corruption, leading to the concealment of land, uneven tax burdens, and increasingly serious abandonment and desertion. After the 22nd year, when politics were on track and people's lives were slightly stabilized, the phenomenon of excessive abandonment of cultivated land and reduced production area still exists today. As for the utilization of land, it is even more extensive. People are lazy by nature, and cultivation has seen little improvement. Although there is water conservancy from the Yellow River, it has not yet achieved the purpose of utilization.

Legal Lending Method

All military, political, and financial institutions engaged in deposit and lending business in the province are prohibited from lending public funds or capital to merchants at low interest rates, allowing them to re-lend at high interest rates and exploit the blood and sweat of farmers. The Provincial Bank should formulate measures, modeled after cooperative lending methods, to lend all funds to farm households engaged in cultivation through cooperatives. Violating institutions will be reported and punished. Merchants and public educators who privately engage in usury and exploit farmers will be severely punished.

Appeal from the Authorities

Although Ningxia has a small population, if everyone works for their own livelihood, no one will starve or freeze. Only those who seek gain without labor, are idle and dissolute, or have bad habits are social parasites. The provincial government stipulates that after reaching the age of compulsory labor service, people should automatically participate in various production activities. Those with bad habits or unemployed vagrants should be made to reform. Otherwise, village chiefs can send them to the county government for custody and sincere training or organize them into labor teams to participate in public cultivation. The government also stipulates that every farmer must raise at least one head of cattle or mule to strengthen their cultivation ability. These livestock cannot be regarded as property and freely sold or mortgaged. In addition, the government encourages people to contract pastures to raise livestock. Private cattle and horses can be distributed and used by the government in a unified manner, but payment will be made at market prices. If there is a shortage of labor or land abandonment in rural areas, the government will organize public farms and use machinery or military power to cultivate.

The authorities have made the following appeal to the farmers: Production is the foundation of supporting people. If everyone is to have food, everyone must first have work. As the saying goes, "Sweat your own sweat and eat your own rice." With equal land distribution, rational use of funds, and farmers' dedication to work, the rural economy cannot but be revitalized.

Tillers Own Their Fields

Now, the authorities, considering that the foundation of military affairs should still be sought in politics, regard improving people's lives and stabilizing social order as the primary goals. In other words, it is necessary to implement equal land rights to solve the land problem and enable tillers to own their fields; to regulate capital and be able to use funds well to revitalize the rural economy; and to advocate diligence and thrift, increase production, and enrich the people through labor education. The aim is to seek the prosperity of the entire society in a spirit of peace and mutual assistance, eliminate class struggle, eliminate inequality between rich and poor, so that everyone has work and food, and then the bandits will be quelled and eliminated on their own. A new China of prosperity, strength, health, and happiness can be expected to be realized soon.

Implementing New Plans

In order to realize the above aspirations, the Ningxia Provincial Government has recently promulgated and implemented a land reform plan to support rural work, with detailed regulations on the distribution, utilization, and development of land, funds, and labor. To effectively and thoroughly implement this plan, a group of workers has been trained to form rural support work teams, which are going to various counties to conduct detailed surveys and statistics on land, population, labor, and the current status of the rural economy. At the same time, rural work committees have been established in each county and township to jointly promote the realization of this aspiration.

The basic spirit of this work plan has been described above. Now, let's report on some of the individual key points:

New Estimates of Farmland

According to the latest estimates of the Ningxia Provincial Government, there are no less than 600,000 mu of cultivable raw and ripe land in the province. It is also planned to build a large canal along the Helan Mountains in the near future, which will increase the amount of wasteland by 3 million mu. Building a large canal along the Niutou Mountains can increase the amount of farmland by 500,000 mu. If scientific cultivation is used to increase labor and capital, making the land yield two harvests per year, it will be equivalent to having nearly 30 million mu of farmland in the province, which will be sufficient to distribute to the province's 700,000 people. However, the provincial government believes that there are more disadvantages than advantages to distributing land according to the number of people, so it stipulates that each household will be the unit, with 40 mu for one to five people, 80 mu for five to ten people, and an additional 4 mu for each additional person above ten. In this way, the existing social structure will not be destroyed, and population growth can be encouraged. The excess part of the existing land can be contracted by tenant farmers, renters, and hired laborers, who have priority to contract from landlords after the plan is announced. If no one contracts, demobilized soldiers and military families with cultivation ability have the second priority. The payment for the contracted land is based on rice and wheat as the standard, and the contractors will pay it off in fifteen years (but those who wish to pay it off in one lump sum or voluntarily shorten the period are allowed). Land prices are divided into three grades: the highest price for Grade A is two shi and one dou of the market, one shi and five dou for Grade B, and one shi and five sheng for Grade C; the highest amount of land price paid each year shall not exceed one shi and four sheng.

Land Acquired

Attachments to the excess land, such as houses and trees, can be levied or purchased incidentally. However, it is rigidly stipulated that the land acquired under this plan must be self-cultivated and not rented out. Without approval, it must not be arbitrarily abandoned, divided, or transferred.

If farmland has fragmented plots that are not suitable for economical cultivation, the government will expand them into collective farms to replace labor with mechanized cultivation. As for the remaining land to be distributed (including public land), in addition to retaining a portion for farmers who need land to continue to apply for, it will all be designated as public farms, mobilizing local labor for public cultivation or handing it over to the military for land reclamation.

Use of Funds

In terms of the use of funds, the focus is on cracking down on usury and revitalizing the rural economy, so that capital can be well used in rural production to enrich people's lives. To achieve this goal, the first step is to improve the relationship between lenders and borrowers. The government will bear the guarantee responsibility for loans to rural investment and increase the interest rate to 2% to 2.5% in silver coins. When private loans are contracted, it must be noted that "interest is calculated annually." If interest is calculated monthly or compound interest is charged, it will be considered usury, which the government will absolutely strictly prohibit. Village heads will guarantee loans or use agricultural products as collateral, but it is not allowed to agree on low prices for rice and wheat in advance. Violators will be severely punished.

Agricultural Lending Institutions

The plan also stipulates that in the future, agricultural lending institutions should closely connect with land administration agencies and cooperative organizations in their business and re-plan. For farmers who contract cultivated land, loans should be concentrated for the needs of acquiring land or purchasing cattle and tools. The procedures should be simplified as much as possible, and the amount should be sufficient for use, so that it is in line with the land reform policy. Loans are not allowed to be given to other farmers who do not contract land in accordance with this plan; moreover, the families of soldiers fighting in the suppression of bandits have priority for such agricultural loans, and the government guarantees them. In addition, regardless of public or private loans, it is not allowed to mortgage or sell land, cattle, mules, agricultural tools, etc., which are necessary for agricultural production, to pay off debts.

### End of the Gold Rush: Ma Hongkui Oversteps His Authority

— Our Special Correspondent Peng Lin

[Our Ningxia Dispatch, Fourth Day] The Ningxia gold deposit and exchange craze has been investigated by the military law office. A total of 131 taels, 1 mace, 4 fen, and 5 li of gold have been found. The depositors are Cheng Jiapeng, manager of the Central Bank, and his family members and staff, totaling thirteen people, who deposited 14 taels, 5 qian, and 4 li. Wang Xiling and six other staff members of the Bank of Communications deposited 20 taels, 4 fen, and 4 li. Niu Yinzhou, manager of the Farmers Bank, and his staff and family members, totaling eight people, deposited 6 taels, 9 qian, 7 fen, and 6 li. Han Hongyuan and eleven other staff members and family members of the Commercial Bank deposited 11 taels, 8 qian, 6 fen, and 5 li. Twenty-six merchants from other provinces deposited a total of 63 taels, 4 qian, and 2 fen, and 5 li. Nine officials from the military and political circles, such as Ma Junru, deposited a total of 14 taels, 3 qian, 3 fen, and 1 li. Although there are indeed eight people such as Li Zichang, they firmly claimed that they did not deposit or exchange. In addition, forty-four people are either using aliases or have no address, so they cannot be traced. Therefore, the remaining 58 taels of gold have been secretly purchased by those with power and wealth using aliases. The people of this province and general low-paid public educators were unable to deposit and exchange their shares.

According to Ma Hongkui himself, when the first batch of gold arrived in Ningxia, Cheng Jiapeng, the manager of the Central Bank, asked Zhao Xudong, the chief of the General Affairs Department, to inquire with Ma about whether he was willing to purchase the gold. Ma sternly refused. When the gold was not publicly deposited and exchanged and was exhausted, the people were full of resentment, and public opinion in the province was in an uproar. Measures were then taken to order the military law office to thoroughly investigate the surnames of the gold depositors. The case is now nearing its end. Chairman Ma Hongkui issued a public notice to all sectors, explaining the difficulties of the investigation and that it was all out of concern for the people and that he had no intention of "overstepping his authority." His public notice stated: "If this chairman thoroughly investigates, the whole case will definitely be clarified... But looking at the overall situation, the situation in North China is urgent, and the bloody battle on the Huai River is in full swing. This bank (referring to the Ningxia branch of the Central Bank) is not affiliated with this government, and this matter is not related to the overall situation. I really do not want to bother the President with a small matter in a corner. However, the enormity of the evil forces in society and the selfishness of financial personnel can be seen from this. This chairman has exhausted all methods and used all his strength for this unfair matter, but unfortunately, the world is not what it used to be, and people's hearts are sinking. There are many who are greedy for money and profit, and few who are eager for public service and justice. Although I want to uphold justice and distinguish right from wrong, I am obstructed by evil forces, which has led to the failure to thoroughly investigate the whole case and the failure to benefit the people. This chairman feels that his virtue is thin and his ability is weak, and he is unable to control the public. He is unable to live up to the heavy trust of the central government, and he is unable to comfort the eager expectations of the elders. When I think about it at midnight, I cannot sleep peacefully! However, I have fulfilled my responsibilities and made my intentions clear, and the elders of all sectors should be able to understand."

### New Year's Talk on Hangzhou: The Issue of Building a Cultural City Re-raised

— Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, Ninth Day] In the New Year of 1949, playwright Xiong Fuxi, sculptor Liu Kaiqu and Qiu Yao, a teacher at the Shanghai Municipal Experimental Drama School, came to Hangzhou together. Mr. Liu said as soon as he saw me, "I sympathize with your continuous efforts in the Shen Bao to build a cultural city in Hangzhou!" He was a professor at the National West Lake Art College before the war and has been away from Hangzhou for twenty years. He said, "Hangzhou is indeed an ideal cultural city. There is no other way for Hangzhou except to build a cultural city."

Including the reporter, we exchanged opinions with writer Sun Fuxi, who flatly sympathized with my proposition. We also went to find painter Ni Yide, and went to Jingci Temple, Tiger Spring, Jade Emperor Mountain, Longjing Temple, and Longjing Village to play. Every time we went to a place, concrete designs that should be present in the construction of a cultural city floated up.

Extensive Cultural Activities—Jade Emperor Mountain Will Not Be Isolated

We feel that although many scenic spots and historical sites, such as Jade Emperor Mountain, have undergone constant artificial reorganization, their contribution to the entire society is still small. It is nothing more than flaunting the style of the elite to the wealthy and leisurely, without real, realistic, and great value, because it has not been refined by culture. Therefore, we feel that it is close to vulgarity, and even not as good as the simple and original sentiments contained in Longjing Temple and Longjing Village. Mr. Yide said: It is also inappropriate for Jade Emperor Mountain to become an art college, because the new realism is to be close to the people and close to reality. I said: The words still have to be said over and over again. If there are many shuttle buses that can cheaply send people to Jade Emperor Mountain, and when the people get adequate rest, and there are extensive cultural activities on Jade Emperor Mountain, then Jade Emperor Mountain will not be too "isolated." In our conversation, it can be said that we discussed everything from top to bottom, past and present, China and foreign countries. From Picasso's paintings to several modern Chinese painters, from the architecture of Italy and France to the architecture in China's Hangzhou scenic area. Everything about music, drama, etc. was discussed.

Open the Door to Welcome Cultural People—Expand Institutions in Quality and Quantity

We have talked about the fact that general literary and artistic workers are often limited by the environment and cannot develop the environment and overcome the environment, which affects their works and their future. Therefore, we cannot only be satisfied with the reality of Hangzhou, and we cannot only build it in reality, but we should have a more distant and brighter ideal.

Of course, if Hangzhou is to be built into a cultural city, it should first allow cultural people to cultivate and operate on this land. First of all, Hangzhou itself should open its doors to welcome them, thereby expanding and improving cultural institutions in terms of both quality and quantity, so that they have work to do and things to ask for, so as to give full play to their talents.

Expand the Foundation of the Art Exhibition—Art Museum Should Be Established

As it stands now, the National West Lake Art College should expand its foundation. The current art college is mostly painting, with very little sculpture added. It cannot be called a complete art college. It is necessary to make the West Lake Art College have departments of fine arts, music, sculpture, drama, dance, and architecture, so that the art college becomes a central institution that specializes in studying the theoretical systems and life practices of various arts.

In addition to the art college, it is best to establish an art museum. If a new art museum can be built, it would be best; otherwise, it can be discussed with the Education Association on Yingshi Street to rent the Education Association and transform it. This art museum is the center of artistic activities. It can be used as a base to launch various artistic activities and cooperate closely with the art college for academic research, and strive to carry out various activities according to each season.

If the foundation of the art college can be expanded and an art museum can be added, it will be able to accommodate a larger number of cultural people, thereby enabling Hangzhou Cultural City to obtain the embryo of a prototype. Of course, this also requires magazines for pure literature and art, newspapers that are excellent and specialized in spreading cultural seeds, and various publications related to cultural undertakings.

The Authorities Should Formulate an Overall Plan for Beautifying Hangzhou

The Hangzhou Municipal Government must adopt the opinions of cultural people to beautify the metropolis of Hangzhou. At the same time, the construction of buildings in the city, where to build what type of houses is appropriate, such as building Chinese-style and antique-style houses near the lake, building Western-style houses in residential areas, and building tall Western-style buildings in commercial areas, etc., should all be pre-planned with a certain format and an overall plan. The planting of what kind of trees in what places, such as planting willows along the lake and planting fruit trees in the mountains, etc., should also have appropriate arrangements.

Some people think that in this era of frequent wars, what is there to talk about art and culture? Everyone knows that only art and culture can eliminate war and make people universally nourished by art and culture, so that they can live actively, upward, and progressively. Precisely because there are frequent wars today, we should more urgently call for the construction of a cultural city.

We once heard Chairman Chen Gongqia say that he would set up a cultural center, which is a good idea. However, culture includes a very wide range: Therefore, I hope that the cultural center can be changed to an art museum and urgently realized. We had a chat with Mayor Ren Xianqun, and he also sympathized with the construction of Hangzhou as a cultural city. However, sympathy is not enough. He should focus on cultural construction in future construction and hope to have a concrete plan and promote its realization one by one.

Mr. Ni Yide told reporters: "Regarding your proposition to build Hangzhou as a cultural city, I sympathize with you and support you. The establishment of the West Lake Art Research Institute can be said to be a de facto voice of support!"

Several of us have agreed: In the future, our actions will surely strive to realize the ideal of building Hangzhou as this cultural city!

### New After Viewing of Yi Ethnic Group

[Our Ya'an Dispatch, January 6] Since the Yi ethnic group's sightseeing tour of Nanjing, Shanghai and other places returned, all the members of the group have had an extremely good impact on Yi affairs: (1) After returning home, each member of the group publicized the process and feelings of this trip, as well as the photos, paintings, and weapons given to them by the heads of state, departments, and ministries, along with the recorded phonograph records from Shanghai, to their relatives and friends, and went deep into the Yi nests in the Greater Liang Mountains to promote and explain the government's intentions, and describe the progress of human evolution. These Yi people were deeply moved and their thinking changed as a result, and their hearts turned towards civilization. Recently, Luo Daying, Luo Zhenjiang, Luo Benjia, Guoji Mada and other members of the group led dozens of Yi chieftains such as Luo Hongchang from Woli, Bazhe, Guabie, Puxiong and other places who had never been to Xichang before, and they all went to Xichang automatically to express their absolute support for the government and stabilize the border areas. (2) The Yi people recognize that the Han and Yi are one family, and there is no longer any distinction between them. They also realize that if they want to make the Yi people progress, they should start with culture and education. They organized a branch of the Yi Ethnic Cultural Association in Xichang. Sun Fang and Wang Jimin were elected as the heads and deputy heads. A craze for setting up schools has now been set off in the vast Yi area. The chieftains of the Yi people in various places recently gathered in Xichang and asked the government to guide and assist them in running border people's education. It has been decided to divide the four places of Bazhe, Puxiong, Beishan, and Ningdong in the Yi area into education areas to prepare for the establishment of a total of eighteen border people's primary schools, and to appoint special personnel to be responsible for the preparation. They are scheduled to open in the coming spring, and all existing school buildings have been built.

### A New Foolish Old Man Moves Mountains: Chengwudu Highway Now Open

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 7th] A visitor from Wudu said: Construction on the Chengwudu Highway began in March of last year, employing over three hundred civilian laborers daily. After more than nine months, the entire route is now fully open and unobstructed. The most difficult engineering feat was the Hongjiwan section near Wudu. This area, originally named "Hongtuwan" (Red Earth Bay), has historically been a dangerous cliffside path. The number of people who disappeared while traveling through this area is countless, making it a perilous route for travelers. During the Guangxu reign (Qing Dynasty), the path was renovated and renamed "Hongjiwan," with an inscription carved in stone alongside the road, signifying a blessing for safe passage. However, the natural hazards remained. During the surveying of the Chengwudu Highway last year, it was widely believed that the project was too difficult to complete. However, Ding, the commissioner in the eighth district of Gansu province and concurrently the director of the engineering bureau, was determined to overcome nature with the spirit of "moving mountains." A portion of the cliff, approximately two hundred thousand cubic meters, was cut away from the mountain peak. The road was finally completed. The Hongjiwan, historically regarded as a treacherous area, has been transformed into a safe and smooth thoroughfare.

### Silk Market Initially Weak, Then Stabilized

Yesterday, the market for human silk was unusually tight, with businesses facing difficulties in cash flow. Shadow interest rates soared as high as one thousand yuan for overnight loans, with rates ranging from one hundred and thirty yuan, leaving many overleveraged. Sales flooded the market, leading to sluggish conditions. The 120 Guangtian Bridge new goods opened at a low price of 73,000 yuan in the morning. There was strong selling pressure, and buyers were hesitant. In a matter of moments, the asking price dropped by another three thousand yuan, causing the market to weaken further. After a long period of consolidation, the tight credit conditions eased, and shadow interest rates dropped by thirty to fifty yuan. Buying interest returned to the market, and short covering occurred from yesterday's positions. External speculative funds also exerted pressure, leading to a shift from fear to stability. The market recovered by two thousand yuan at closing, with arbitrage pushing it up by seven thousand yuan. In the afternoon, external factors stabilized slightly, boosting confidence and improving market sentiment. Asking prices rose again. Guangtian Bridge was quoted at 84,000 yuan and 85,000 yuan for forward dates, and Dongyang was quoted at 85,000 yuan and 86,000 yuan, representing an increase of 5,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

The market price of raw silk foreign exchange transfer certificates continued to decline slightly, and human silk and satin also weakened. Businesses similarly faced tight credit conditions, with a lack of orders. Many traders were still struggling to sell after the opening, but ultimately succumbed to the pressure of high interest rates, causing the market to soften. Billion-grade separate-handled spot goods opened at 84,000 yuan and 85,000 yuan in the morning, but the overall trend was weak. Negative external factors led to aggressive selling in the market, causing prices to fall by four to five thousand yuan. In the afternoon, human silk recovered, credit conditions eased, and the market stabilized slightly, with asking prices rising by two thousand yuan.

Yesterday, the satin market was hampered by tight credit, resulting in sluggish trading. Businesses were fearful, and external factors declined across the board. Local buyers were inactive, while speculative traders rushed to sell, weakening the market. Meiya opened at 43,500 yuan, but the trend continued downward, nearing the 40,000 yuan mark. The market then stagnated, with trading coming to a standstill. Near the close, buying interest stirred slightly, leading to a slight recovery, ultimately closing at 41,500 yuan. Asking prices rose again by one thousand yuan in the afternoon.

### Tung Oil Market Remains Strong Throughout the Process

The tung oil market opened yesterday with tight credit conditions in the market, leading to a general decline in prices of goods outside the circle. Additionally, tung oil prices had been rising excessively in recent days, leading traders to become wary of high prices and gradually seek to sell, causing the market to weaken and decline sharply. The market closed with a consensus drop of one hundred to three hundred yuan. However, green oil continued to be absorbed by paint shops in this area, and exports also rebounded, resulting in particularly strong demand throughout the supply chain, giving it a leading position.

### Should Promote Wild Mountain Tea

— Special Correspondent Zhu Xianggao

Our Correspondent

[Yixing Dispatch, 9th] Yixing was never considered a tea-producing area, but after the sales of pottery teapots at home and abroad, tea planting gradually drew attention and became a major side business. During the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, a variety called "Da Hong Pao" (Big Red Robe) was produced, which was the most prized tea. Imperial officials came to Yixing to purchase tea specifically for the emperor. That's when Yixing gained fame and sparked interest in planting tea among the general public. As a result, production surged, and Yixing became a famous tea-producing area in Jiangsu Province, controlling a large share of the market in both northern and southern China. However, instead of developing, it has been declining. To investigate the root cause, this is not just a problem within some rural areas. Looking back, it may also be the reason why Chinese tea was eliminated from the foreign exchange market by teas from India, Ceylon, and other countries. How to revitalize the industry is a serious issue that needs to be addressed.

Distribution of Tea Producing Areas

Tea farmers can only utilize mountainous areas with relatively poor soil for planting, so the available mountainous land is scarce. Mountain farmers are mostly restricted to limited flat mountains. Therefore, the formal tea-producing areas are only Zhangzhu, Huwen, and the Baihechang in the southern suburbs, totaling around 100 mu. Every year, the tea can be picked in March, May, and July, respectively, as "Yuqian" (before the rain), "Mingqian" (before the Qingming Festival), and "Chunhong" (spring red) teas. After the three teas are harvested, most tea farmers prepare to bind grass for the winter. However, some poor households still pick a fourth tea during the year, which is called "Guodongqing" (overwintering green). However, the picked tea is rough and the growth in the coming spring will be significantly damaged. Many tea farmers who cannot afford to overwinter resort to this self-destructive method. Their picking methods are outdated and follow the branches, resulting in mostly rough tea stalks. Additionally, the selling price is sometimes lower than the cost of production, which hinders quality improvement. This has led to the current decline. Nowadays, Yixing tea is only sold in Beijing, Shanghai, and north of the Yangtze River because its quality has not been improved, resulting in shoddy products. It has been demoted from the prestigious living room to a cheap beverage in hotels, bathrooms, and teahouses, and is being eliminated by tea from Zhejiang and Anhui. According to pre-war statistics, about 300,000 dan were sold annually. Today, North Jiangsu is a war zone, exports have been severely hit, and it cannot compete with Shanghai and Hangzhou. Without seeking progress, how can it avoid decline? However, the good news is that a ray of hope has emerged, like a promising virgin land has been discovered.

Sparse Production of Tea Trees

On seven random occasions, woodcutters discovered a few vibrant camellia plants in the deep mountains. They picked the flowers, brewed them, and found that they had a unique taste. Tea farmers considered it a miracle and opened up a new path for the county's tea industry. There has been no expert study on this quality, and everyone simply calls it "Wild Mountain Tea." As the name suggests, it is buried between deep mountains and wilderness, and it requires patient people to discover it. Due to its scarcity, although it has been around for nearly a hundred years, it is still rarely seen in the market and enjoyed by the general public. It has not been promoted, like an undiscovered treasure. Perhaps it is because the soil naturally suits the nature of tea planting. The extraordinary novelty of wild mountain tea has no other explanation for study. The reporter visited a wealthy tea farmer who owned more than ten mu of mountainous land and went with him to visit his tea plantation. On a not-so-high flat mountain, a piece of flat land was filled with tea trees of varying heights, lush and green, with no gaps in sight. Some of them even cultivated whole plots of land between the rows of trees, planting taro and soybeans because the production of tea trees was low, and they had no choice but to plant other miscellaneous grains to supplement their income. There were hardly any wild mountain tea trees that he transplanted from afar. They looked particularly small, and he carefully picked a small amount of tea for us to brew and drink at his house. It was indeed well-deserved. The taste, color, and aroma became more mellow over time. Compared with Qimen and Longjing teas, it was like the calligraphy of Li and Yan, forming its own style. Even after four infusions of boiling water, it was still green and fresh, which was by no means comparable to the products sold in the market.

Maojian (Downy Tip) Takes the Lead

Among wild mountain teas, Maojian is the best. Even after careful roasting, a layer of fine hair remains on the leaves. "Wild Mountain Maojian" is the best of the best, and is distinguished by this feature. Although it has been transplanted by ordinary tea farmers, it has not attracted the attention and investment of the Beijing and Shanghai markets due to its scarce production and high labor costs. There is concern that transplantation would be unprofitable. Therefore, it has not yet gained recognition. Ordinary tea farmers have failed to improve the soil quality and production, and they have no interest in transplanting. Every year, in late autumn, large tea farmers go to seek and collect tea once. According to the Tea Industry Association, only a few dan have been shipped out of the mountains this year, and all have been collected and treasured by local gentry tea drinkers who know the goods in the city, preparing to savor them slowly. Although there is a very small amount of tea for sale in the market, most of it is imitation, deceiving laymen.

Adding Color to Tea

Recently, several major tea merchants, yearning for the heyday of tea production in the past, initiated the organization of the Yixing Tea Production and Marketing Cooperative. In addition to improving production, the central work is to transplant wild mountain tea in large quantities and study soil cultivation techniques. Although the technical methods cannot compete with the tea market abroad, according to the reporter's observation, it will definitely be a strong competitor to teas from Zhejiang and Anhui. They have already begun to implement this plan on New Year's Day. They are willing to bear the painful and expensive costs of reclamation, strive to avoid exploitation by middlemen, call on major tea farmers to be the basic cooperative members, guide all tea farmers in the county to improve varieties, and strive to cultivate large quantities of wild mountain tea. The plan is to increase production by ten thousand ancestors of family tea and five hundred thousand dan in the first year, sell it themselves, open up new markets, and step from decline back to prosperity.
