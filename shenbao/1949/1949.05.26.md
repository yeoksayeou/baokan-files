### The Eight-Point Code of the People's Liberation Army

Proclamation of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:

The Kuomintang reactionaries have refused to accept the peace terms and persist in their criminal war against the nation and the people. The people of the whole country hope that the People's Liberation Army will quickly eliminate the Kuomintang reactionaries. We have ordered the People's Liberation Army to bravely advance, eliminate all Kuomintang reactionary troops who dare to resist, arrest all war criminals who are incorrigible, liberate the people of the whole country, and guarantee the independence and integrity of China's territorial sovereignty, truly realizing the genuine peace, democracy, and unity desired by the people of the whole country. Wherever the People's Liberation Army arrives, it is hoped that people from all walks of life will provide assistance. The following eight-point code is hereby proclaimed, and we hope that all our people will abide by it together.

(1) Protect the lives and property of all the people. People from all walks of life, regardless of class, belief, or occupation, are expected to maintain order and adopt a cooperative attitude with the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army will adopt a cooperative attitude with people from all walks of life. Counter-revolutionaries or other saboteurs who take the opportunity to cause trouble, rob, or destroy will be severely punished.

(2) Protect national industry, commerce, agriculture, and animal husbandry. Factories, shops, banks, warehouses, ships, wharves, farms, pastures, etc., privately operated are all protected and not to be infringed upon. It is hoped that employees in all industries will continue production as usual, and shops will continue business as usual.

(3) Confiscate bureaucratic capital. Factories, shops, banks, warehouses, ships, wharves, railways, post offices, telegraphs, telephones, waterworks, farms, pastures, etc., operated by the Kuomintang reactionary government and major bureaucrats will all be taken over by the People's Government. If there are private shares of national industrialists, merchants, farmers, and herdsmen in them, their ownership will be recognized after investigation. All personnel working in bureaucratic capital enterprises must continue to work as before until the People's Government takes over, and be responsible for protecting assets, machinery, charts, books, files, etc., pending inventory and takeover. Those who have made meritorious contributions to protection will be rewarded, and those who slacken off and sabotage will be punished. Those who wish to continue to serve will be allowed to be employed according to their talents after the People's Government takes over, so that they will not be displaced.

(4) Protect all public and private schools, academies, cultural and educational institutions, sports venues, and all other public welfare undertakings. All personnel working in these institutions are expected to continue to work as usual. The People's Liberation Army will protect them all and they shall not be infringed upon.

(5) Except for incorrigible war criminals and counter-revolutionaries with heinous crimes, all officials of the Kuomintang central, provincial, municipal, and county governments, representatives to the National Assembly, members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan, senators, police personnel, and heads of districts, towns, townships, and baojia who do not resist with arms or conspire to sabotage will not be taken as prisoners, arrested, or insulted by the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government. The above-mentioned personnel are ordered to remain at their posts, obey the orders of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government, and be responsible for protecting the assets and files of various institutions, pending takeover and disposal. Those among these personnel who have special skills and no serious reactionary behavior or serious malfeasance will be allowed to be employed by the People's Government on a case-by-case basis. Those who take the opportunity to sabotage, steal, embezzle, carry public funds, public property, or public cases and flee, or refuse to hand over, will be held accountable.

(6) In order to ensure urban and rural security and stabilize social order, all scattered soldiers and bandits should surrender and report to the local People's Liberation Army or the People's Government. Those who voluntarily surrender and report and hand over all their weapons will not be prosecuted. Those who refuse to report or conceal weapons will be arrested and investigated with the enthusiastic participation of the people. Those who harbor without reporting will also be subject to appropriate punishment.

(7) The feudal land ownership system in the countryside is unreasonable and should be abolished. However, the abolition of this system must be prepared and carried out step by step. Generally speaking, rent and interest reduction should be carried out first, followed by land distribution, and it will only be possible to seriously solve the land problem after the People's Liberation Army arrives and works for a considerable period. The peasant masses should be organized to assist the People's Liberation Army in carrying out various initial reforms, while striving to cultivate and ensure that the existing level of industrial production is not reduced, and then gradually improve it, in order to improve the lives of peasants and provide the urban people with commercial grain. Urban land and housing cannot be handled in the same way as rural land problems.

(8) Protect the safety of the lives and property of foreign nationals. It is hoped that all foreign nationals must abide by the laws and decrees of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government, must not engage in espionage activities, must not engage in activities that oppose the cause of national independence and people's liberation of China, and must not harbor Chinese war criminals, counter-revolutionaries, and other criminals; otherwise, they will be subject to the legal sanctions of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government.

The People's Liberation Army is strict in discipline, buys and sells fairly, and is not allowed to take a needle or thread from the people. It is hoped that all our people will live and work in peace, and do not easily believe rumors and frighten each other. This is especially announced.

### The Liberation Army Enters Eastern Jiangxi and Pays Homage to the Hometown of Fang Zhimin

(Broadcast from Beiping Xinhua Radio Station) Zhejiang-Jiangxi Front, 24th Dispatch: After a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army entered Qigong Town, Yiyang County, eastern Jiangxi, the hometown of revolutionary martyr Comrade Fang Zhimin, the commanders and fighters went to Hutang Village, the birthplace of the martyr, to pay their respects, and to express their condolences to the martyr's family and the local people. Comrade Fang Zhimin was one of the founders of the Chinese Red Army. In just two years, he developed from three rifles into the Tenth Army of the Red Army, controlling a vast area on the border of Fujian, Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces. In 1934, Comrade Fang Zhimin led the Chinese Red Army Anti-Japanese Advance Team northward to resist Japan. Chiang Kai-shek, who insisted on selling out the country and carrying out civil war, used seven times the force to encircle and attack. Comrade Fang Zhimin was unfortunately captured during the breakout. In July 1935, he was murdered by Chiang Kai-shek in Nanchang. Now the unit has dispatched special personnel to carry comfort supplies to comfort the martyr's family, and to collect the martyr's heroic deeds to carry out education in the troops.

The Kuomintang reactionaries are facing the fate of being wiped out, and have recently become inhumane, releasing poison gas, massacring people, destroying buildings, and destroying materials, making desperate and arrogant destruction. All of our army, from top to bottom, must work harder and take all effective measures to protect the lives and property of the country and the people, so that they will not be damaged or destroyed by the Kuomintang army, and those who are the primary instigators of evil must be thoroughly investigated and severely punished. To this end, in accordance with the spirit of our army's Double Tenth Declaration of 1947, the following orders are announced:

First, all Kuomintang military officers, party departments, and government officials at all levels who order their subordinates to carry out the following crimes and the evidence is conclusive shall be convicted as war criminals:

Third, those who take effective measures, thereby ensuring that the lives and property of the people and all the spoils of war and urban construction belonging to our army are completely protected from destruction, shall be given due rewards. The People's Liberation Army in all localities should earnestly implement this order. Our army's policy towards the Kuomintang reactionary party, government, and military personnel is: "The leader must be punished, the coerced will not be questioned, and the meritorious will be rewarded." War criminals must be pursued, and the leaders must be held accountable. They must be pursued to the ends of the earth, and they must be brought to justice and not allowed to escape. This is especially ordered.

### North China People's Government Allows Foreign Merchants to Trade; Hong Kong Merchants Are Confident that the Volume of Trade in the North Can Increase

(Hong Kong Dispatch) The North China People's Government has allowed foreign merchants to engage in trade. According to the Far Eastern Economic Review, since Hong Kong has dispelled the immature and incorrect understanding of the attitude and procedures of the Chinese Communist authorities in North China and Northeast China regarding trade, normal commercial relations between Hong Kong and North China have begun. Merchant ships and merchants of any nationality are very eager to restore the very profitable trade with North China. After a short period of hesitation, American merchants and transportation companies are also actively trading with the CCP. Naturally, the majority of trade between Hong Kong and North China is still conducted by Chinese. When trading with North China, although regulations such as import and export trade and maritime transportation must be observed, other aspects clearly imply that the CCP authorities are eager to develop trade. Before the financial chaos in the whole of China is replaced by a new order, bulk trade must still be based on barter. For this year, local merchants are confident that they can increase the volume of trade with North China and Northeast China. For the benefit of the Chinese people and global commerce, transportation, aviation, telecommunications, banking, and insurance industries, it is necessary to quickly establish and regulate. According to a certain authority in the trade sector, based on the information obtained from various sources, rent-seeking and speculation are not desirable, but there is always a profit that is better than other trade routes. It is a bias for a small number of merchants to expect high profits. As far as we know, every ship to North China will not lose money, but the actual net profit will vary, and the materials in different regions will be good or bad. The goods shipped from Hong Kong to the liberated areas in the past may not have been needed by the liberated areas, so the profit may be thin. Some of the exchanged materials are not liked by merchants, so we can know that the trade between Hong Kong and North China, including Tianjin, will definitely gradually improve and become Hong Kong's normal trade.

Currently, a small number of trading companies in Hong Kong that are engaged in business with the liberated areas seem to be emotionally low, which is due to their excessively high expectations. Because the trade bureaus in the ports of the liberated areas stipulate that the gross profit should be more than 40%, even if the freight is high because everyone in Hong Kong wants to get high-value and marketable materials, they will inevitably be unhappy when they get materials that they do not like. To anticipate this phenomenon, it is necessary to study the supply and demand relationship between the two sides in advance. The recent telegrams reported that the Tianjin Trade Bureau signed barter contracts with merchants, so the future trade between Hong Kong and Tianjin can proceed along a more rational path. Therefore, the current and future trade situation will definitely be improved better. The only important thing is that those who do business with the liberated areas in Hong Kong should not hope to obtain high profits, because trading with the liberated areas is also a contribution, and one should never hope to get rich overnight.

### Statement by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions: Protest Against India's Brutal Acts

[New China News Agency, Beiping, 25th] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, in protest against the Indian reactionary government's persecution of democrats and trade union personnel, issued the following statement today: According to telegrams from Delhi, the Indian government has recently carried out cruel persecution and massacres of Indian trade union leaders, communists, and democrats in Hyderabad, Jodhpur, Bombay, Delhi, and other places. We express our utmost indignation at these brutal acts and lodge a strong protest. We believe that these brutal acts by the Indian reactionary government are a direct violation of the Indian people's interests in obtaining genuine independence, democracy, and freedom. This is a crime that cannot be forgiven by any democratic and free people or the working people of the world and will inevitably be met with even more violent resistance from the entire Indian people. Here, we extend our deepest condolences and sympathy to all the working-class brothers and democrats in India who have been massacred and persecuted. We believe that your struggle for independence, democracy, and freedom, with the firm support of peace-loving people around the world, will surely achieve a brilliant victory throughout India.

### Developing Nenjiang's Industrial Achievements

[Northeast News] Since the Northeast Nenjiang Province-operated industries conference in July last year, the general production of each factory has embarked on the right track after the three major policies of developing manufacturing, restricting textiles, and reducing and merging grain processing industries, as well as unified management and reasonable adjustments, and great achievements have been made in the past six months.

First, the entire province's industries were unified, and a total of 123 factories and workshops were taken over, with a total capital value of 13,572,565,518 yuan. Among them, there were 61 grain and rice processing industries, with a total capital value of 7,169,434,378 yuan, accounting for 52.4%. After the merger, there were 39. There were originally 11 textile industries in the province, and after the merger, each city only had three, and Fuyu and Anda had one each, totaling five. The leadership can also concentrate its efforts on management. In the past six months, 11 places including glass factories, pharmaceutical factories, winery factories, match factories, breweries (four places), and the flax factory attached to the Nenjiang Textile Factory, and the blood cake factory attached to the leather factory have been built successively. Except for the factory, which will not be completed until March next year, all other factories have started production one after another.

At present, there are 92 factories in the province, with a total capital of 59,979,775,045 yuan. Among them, there are 39 grain processing industries, with a capital of 28,573,586,500 yuan, accounting for 47.85%, 5 textile industries, with a capital of 9,983,082,733 yuan, accounting for 6.59%, and other industries with a total capital of 21,423,105,812 yuan, accounting for 35.56%. Although the grain processing industry has declined, it still accounts for the largest proportion.

In the past six months, the production situation of each province-operated factory, except for the Sanhe Jianhuo Mill, has generally been normal. The Leather Factory completed 101.36% of the production plan, the Nenjiang Textile Factory completed 101.48% of the spinning, the Xinhua Textile Factory completed 109.7%, the Limin Weaving Factory completed 113.63%, the two distilleries completed 112-115%, and the Match Factory completed 108.06%. The Nenjiang and Xinhua Textile Factories reduced weaving due to the high price of yarn and the low price of cloth, completing only 85.57% and 75.61% respectively. The Nenjiang Pharmaceutical Factory and others have not completed the production tasks because their initial construction and production have not yet become regularized. After the unification of the factories, because the capital figures of the factories were mostly inconsistent with reality, a warehouse cleanup was implemented to determine each factory, which ended at the end of September. The completion of this work changed the awareness of all employees about people's property, strengthened the responsibilities of the storage organization and the custodians, improved storage methods, improved work efficiency, disposed of unnecessary materials, improved warehouse equipment, and universally established a warehouse system. The main finished products produced in the past year are: cloth—3,133 bolts, foreign yarn 87,135 catties, matches 72,400 boxes, flour 8,344,929 catties, liquor 709,719 catties, and other sorghum rice, soybean oil, medicines, glass, etc. Calculated at an average estimated value, it is worth approximately 68,346,105,337 yuan (by-products not included). If calculated based on 8,433 employees, the average per capita production value (including cost) is 47,694,421 yuan, equivalent to 17 tons of sorghum rice. If calculated based on a net profit of 17.5 billion, then each person added about 8,740 catties of sorghum rice to the society, which is about five times the production of farmers.

In the past six months, the province's industries have made a total profit of 20,483,641,985 yuan, of which 61.5% was paid for tasks and 38.49% was retained by the factory for expanded reproduction.

In the past six months of production, some experiences and achievements have been created in improving technology and saving raw materials. Comrade Yu Kainan of the Research Office and Comrade Yu Shengzao of the Leather Factory successfully researched and manufactured blood cake from pine bark. Each catty of pine bark produces 1.8 to 2 taels of blood cake, with a daily output of 54 catties. The pharmaceutical factory used honey to make glucose and clam shells to make calcium chloride under extremely difficult conditions of tools and equipment, and improved the manufacture of injectable drugs, etc. All factories with normal production have increased their output. The number of matches increased from 457 boxes in July to 1,165 boxes in October, an increase of 262.1%, with a daily increase of 87.2%. The average output per spindle of spinning at the Nenjiang Textile Factory increased from 3.05 taels in August to 3.86 taels in November; the output of cloth per machine increased from 34.8 yards in July to 39.6 yards in November; while the spinning reached 0.3% of the standard output (4 taels), and the weaving reached 79.9% of the standard output (48 taels). The weaving rate increased from 97% in August to 99.1% in October, while the weight loss rate decreased from 2.3% to 0.85%. The shoe factory now saves 2 inches of leather compared to the past when making a pair of leather shoes; the glass factory saves 820 catties of coal per day. In addition, in order to reduce expenses, each factory also has a plan to streamline non-production personnel. At present, management personnel only account for 14.5% of the total number of employees in each factory. In the process of developing and rectifying the province-operated industries in the past six months, the following points of experience were gained: (1) It is very necessary to uniformly reorganize and strengthen the leadership of concentrated funds due to the blindness and lack of planning in industrial production in the past. However, if the province manages the industry uniformly, it will not only lose sight of one another but also reduce the classic interest of each county in managing the industry. Therefore, it is necessary to clearly divide the work between the province and the county, and under the unified leadership of the province's industrial production, decentralize management. (2) Only by reducing the remaining industries can funds be drawn to build new factories. The funds for the grass bag factory in Anda and Zhaodong, and the timber exploration company in Nenjiang were solved in this way. (3) The construction of new factories should have a relatively detailed plan. A new factory cannot be completed in a very short time. The proficiency of workers' skills, the difficulty of equipment, the normal source of raw materials, and the opening of sales markets all require considerable time. It should not be rushed to success, and long-term plans must be made to overcome all difficulties and obtain favorable development.

Our province has abundant conditions for developing sideline occupations. Some local products are not only unique in the entire Northeast, but even famous at home and abroad, and have great development prospects. Long-term plans should be made. The most promising sideline occupations in our province are animal husbandry, fish, and meat. Secondly, city saltpeter and yangcao reeds are famous specialties in the entire Northeast, with extremely abundant yields. The weaving industry has developed greatly in the past one or two years. In addition, various fine hides, medicinal materials, mountain goods, etc. also have considerable output. After analyzing the province's sideline occupation situation, he emphasized that the commercial sector in the past did not have a sufficient understanding of the important task of assisting sideline occupations in solving sales, and its contribution was extremely poor. In the future, it must regard assisting sideline occupation production and agricultural production as equally important, and actively and proactively find sales channels for various local products. He also clearly pointed out that various local products purchased by the state and transferred by the province and county are the focus of the province and county commercial departments' sideline occupation promotion this spring. He also called on comrades from various counties to go back and conduct detailed investigations and studies on sideline occupation production in their respective counties. Based on possible sales channels, a plan for the transfer of local products in the county should be made and reported to the province within a time limit.

### Restoration of Straw Hat Industry in Shangjialin, Hebei

...New China News Agency, North China News: The famous straw hat industry in Shangjialin, Xian County, Hebei, has moved from decline to recovery with the support of the People's Government. Shangjialin is a town with more than 800 households. It has been engaged in the straw hat industry for more than 80 years. In its heyday, there were 85 straw hat factories, 210 machines, and more than 600 workers. It could weave 840 dozen straw hats every day, and its products were sold in coastal cities. Farmers in several nearby counties all regarded weaving straw hat braids as one of the main sideline occupations. The women who participated in this production alone once reached 50,000. After the "July 7th" Incident, most of the machines were destroyed by the Japanese invaders, and the Shangjialin straw hat industry almost completely collapsed. Last winter, the Xian County Production Promotion Agency established a branch in the town to specialize in leading the restoration. Four mass cooperative straw hat factories have now been organized, with 787 households as shareholders. A total of 46 machines have been started, and 196 dozen straw hats are produced daily. The gradual recovery of the straw hat industry has greatly benefited the town and nearby farmers.

### Vyshinsky Clarifies Position: Demands Participation in Ruhr Control; German Affairs Still Under Joint Control of Four Powers; Foreign Ministers' Conference Proceeds in Calm and Friendly Atmosphere

(Reuters, Paris, 24th) The Western three powers' foreign ministers today rejected Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky's proposal that the four powers jointly manage Germany in accordance with the "Potsdam Agreement." Vyshinsky made his first speech at today's meeting and demanded participation in the control of the Ruhr industrial area. The meeting proceeded in a calm and friendly atmosphere. The current Ruhr management organization is composed of six countries: Britain, the United States, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Foreign Minister Schuman said: If the old four-power joint management organization is restored, the previous mistakes will inevitably be repeated. US Secretary of State Acheson said: Returning to the old organization of the Potsdam era would be tantamount to calling a newly healed patient who has regained the function of three limbs back to its original state. British Foreign Secretary Bevin emphasized that the Western powers have established a free and democratic government in West Germany and do not intend to abandon this achievement now. Vyshinsky delivered a long speech condemning the Western powers for violating the Potsdam Agreement and attempting to split Germany. The original text of Vyshinsky's proposal is as follows:

"(1) In order to achieve Germany's economic and political unification, (a) restore the German Control Council as the institution exercising supreme power in Germany. (b) Restore the Four-Power Joint Staff in Berlin to unify the administration of the entire city of Berlin and ensure the normal life of the citizens of Berlin. (2) In view of the difficulty in achieving Germany's economic and political unification before the establishment of a German central government, it is necessary to recognize the following two points as necessary measures: (a) establish a German Political Committee for the whole of Germany based on the existing German economic institutions in the East and West Zones. (b) Restore the municipal institutions of the whole of Berlin. The date for the election of the municipal institutions of the whole of Berlin shall be considered and decided by the Four-Power Joint Staff in Berlin." Vyshinsky said that the best way for international control is to establish an institution of strong representation, and countries neighboring Germany should be allowed to send representatives to attend the meetings in a consultative capacity, and German economic groups should also be allowed to send representatives. The four foreign ministers discussed the issue of German unification for about three hours today. Vyshinsky left the meeting first. The Western three powers' foreign ministers drank and talked over drinks in the palace for about 25 minutes. It is expected that the issue of German unification will continue to be discussed at the third meeting at 4:00 p.m. tomorrow. (Picture shows Vyshinsky)

### Bonn Constitution Splits Germany: German Communist Party Representatives Refuse to Sign

[New China News Agency, Beiping, 25th] The divisive "constitution" manufactured single-handedly by the US-British-French bloc was declared effective on the 23rd at the last meeting of the Bonn Constituent Assembly.

Various left-wing parties, including the Christian Social Union, the German Party, and many deputies who previously opposed the Bonn "Constitution," have signed the Bonn "Constitution" under the direction of the United States and Britain, but West German Communist Party representatives Zeng Mann and Lenner both refused to sign.

Lenner declared, "I will never sign for the division of Germany." The Constituent Assembly was dissolved after the Bonn "Constitution" was signed and declared effective by the governors of the West German states. The West German Constituent Assembly was established last year by the US-British-French occupying authorities based on the first London Six-Power (including the US-British-French-Dutch-Belgian-Luxembourg) conference in June last year. It included 65 political leaders from all sides, most of whom were reactionaries. Its purpose was to formulate a "constitution" that would split Germany, dismember Germany, and reduce Germany to a US colony. The characteristic of the Bonn "Constitution" is that it stipulates that West Germany is a "Federal Republic," and gives the main powers to the divided states, while the central government only has secondary powers, so as to facilitate US rule. The Bonn "Constitution" has clauses that clearly sell out German sovereignty, stipulating that some sovereignty can be abandoned to participate in the United States of Europe and other international organizations. The Bonn "Constitution" also does not conceal its fascist nature, stipulating that the government may declare parties that "attack democratic freedom" to be illegal, actually guaranteeing the reactionary government's suppression of the people's freedom. In addition, the Bonn "Constitution" stipulates that the West German parliament is bicameral, with upper house members elected by the state governments and lower house members elected, with a total of 400 members, serving a term of four years. The president is elected by a joint session of both houses, and the premier is elected by the lower house.

### US Aid to Japan to Replenish Police Force

[United Press, Washington, 24th] State Department News Director White stated today that the authorities are studying plans to enable Japan to have a more adequate police force, but there is absolutely no intention to allow it to rebuild any international military force. It is well known that Japan's current police force is insufficient to maintain domestic security. Foreign reports that US officials are actively studying the reconstruction of the Japanese Ministry of Defense are contrary to Japan's post-war constitution and the policies decided by the Far Eastern Commission. The State Department issued the above statement to deny it.

### McCloy Appointed US Commissioner to Germany
US Newspapers Reveal His Background

[Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 25th dispatch] New York: The Southern Needle Daily published a dispatch from its Washington correspondent, Stone, stating that the appointment of McCloy as the US High Commissioner to Germany represents a victory for the Rockefeller Company and Standard Oil. Stone wrote: The appointment of Black to succeed McCloy as President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is another victory for Standard Oil. The law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hope & Hadley, which McCloy belonged to, is the legal advisor to Chase Bank. Stone stated that Chase Bank is the Wall Street branch of the Standard Oil Trust. Stone recalled that Black was the First Vice President of Chase Bank, which was the main financial agent of the Hitler regime and the financial pillar of the oil consortium linked to Farben Industries (Germany's largest chemical industry monopoly). Stone also said that the dismissal of Kollison, Deputy Minister of the Decartelization Department, and the earlier dismissal of another member of the Decartelization Department, Sachs (both of whom had exposed the American authorities' obstruction of decartelization work), as well as McCloy's appointment this time, indicate that the power of the cartels has been strengthened. Stone asserted that Chase Bank has close ties with German industry, and the authorities of Chase Bank "never lost contact" with Hitler's Germany.

### Trieste Free Territory Election Not Free

[Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 25th dispatch] TASS, Rome: Municipal elections will be held in the Anglo-American occupied zone of the Free Territory of Trieste. The city of Trieste will hold elections on June 12, and five cities including Muggia will hold elections on June 19. From the very beginning of the campaign, representatives of the Communist Party and democratic organizations of the Free Territory of Trieste have revealed at mass meetings the conditions created by the Anglo-American occupation authorities that make genuine elections impossible. The occupation authorities fully support fascist instigation groups, and the persecution of progressive elements continues to occur. In order to "maintain law and order" during the elections, the Anglo-American occupation authorities have prepared a police force of 17,000 people, including 7,000 American and British military police, which means that there is one policeman for every twenty people. The Anglo-American authorities have arbitrarily removed about 2,000 people from the voter lists, many of whom are guerrillas and anti-fascists, on the grounds that these people had been sentenced to imprisonment by the fascist (special tribunals) in the past. The Anglo-American authorities obstruct the election campaign, prohibiting Communist organizations from holding meetings. At the same time, the Anglo-American authorities violate the treaty, including thousands of people who returned to Trieste after June 10, 1940, on the voter lists. To encourage the fascist propaganda of the "Italian Social Movement" faction and other reactionary groups in Trieste, the Anglo-American authorities first conducted a series of trials of former guerrillas in the area, and even during the election campaign, they continued to arrest former guerrillas and illegally search the residences of progressive groups. The military authorities also encouraged fascists to make public speeches against Communist representatives. According to the Rome Solidarity newspaper, the Communist Party of the Free Territory of Trieste and several democratic mass organizations issued a special statement denouncing the tyranny of the Anglo-American authorities and notified the United Nations Secretariat of the election policies implemented by the Anglo-Americans in the Free Territory of Trieste. The Free Territory of Trieste is located on the northern shore of the Adriatic Sea between Italy and Yugoslavia, and was established based on an agreement of the Council of Foreign Ministers. Currently, troops from the United States, Britain, and Yugoslavia are still stationed in the Free Territory.

### Profile of Katharine Cornell, Famous American Actress

Katharine Cornell completed her performance of Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra" in May 1948, thus fulfilling her wish. Because, this outstanding American actress, her life's greatest hope was to play the Egyptian queen, and she believes that this Egyptian queen is the most complete woman under Shakespeare's pen. Her performance of this play also broke all records, because the play was performed for two hundred and fifty-one consecutive performances.

Cleopatra is the thirty-third role played by Cornell. Cornell has been active in the American theater scene for thirty years, and she has played women such as Juliet, Saint Joan, Antigone, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and Jo from "Little Women." In addition to being an actress, she has also made contributions to the American theater scene in other aspects. The result of her collaboration with her husband, McClintic, has made her a successful performer. She has introduced many unknown actors to American audiences and made them successful. This list of actors includes Evans, the British actor who played Romeo (when she played Juliet), Orson Welles (who is now a Hollywood producer), French film star Armand, and film star Gregory Peck. Many theatergoers agree with the New York Times theater critic, and support Cornell as the first woman in the American theater scene, and no one can match her on this throne.

Ms. Cornell also encountered opposition when she wanted to stage the play "Barretts of Wimpole Street" in 1931. Almost more than twenty-seven theater managers expressed opposition to the script, because they thought that audiences would not like a sick female character. Later, even she herself lost a little confidence, but her husband insisted that she play the play, and the result proved that the play was their most famous success.

Family Opposed to Studying Drama

Although Ms. Cornell has been immersed in the atmosphere of the theater since she was a child, her parents have always opposed her becoming an actress. Her father was Dr. Cornell. Although Dr. Cornell loved the theater, he studied medicine. When he was a graduate student at the medical school in Berlin, his young wife gave birth to her first child, Katharine. When they returned to Buffalo, Dr. Cornell gave up medicine and became the manager of the "Star Theater." When she saw the play for the first time, she was very moved. She had little interest in school, but she was quite successful in sports—such as tennis and softball. She did not go to college, and as a result, she returned to her original school to teach drama. Her family opposed her acting, they thought her face was too wide, her mouth was too big, her figure was too thin, and she was not attractive at all. But even so, she went to New York to become an actress in 1916. At first, she only played very unimportant roles, and later she did not play any roles for two years.

The theater manager told her: "You don't belong in the theater, go home and marry a good man!"

She now says: "If I only liked drama, those two years would have forced me back home."

Finally, her opportunity finally came. She joined the Jessie Bonstelle Stock Company. She played roles such as maids for a year, until she followed the troupe to London, she was assigned an important role: Jo in "Little Women."

As a result of this performance, she was hired to play the leading role in Clemence Dane's play "A Bill of Divorcement" when it was performed in the United States. When this play was in rehearsal, she married her young director, McClintic, whom she had known for five years.

Since 1925, all the plays starring Ms. Cornell have been directed by McClintic. The plays she has starred in include: "Candida", "The Green Hat", "Dishonored Lady", "The Age of Innocence", "Saint Joan", "The Doctor's Dilemma", "Antony and Cleopatra". She has been looking for a new script since the spring of 1948.

Sports and Makeup

Ms. Cornell possesses a "desirable and fluid face." She is slender and strong, and possesses an athlete's dignity. She plays tennis and golf very well. The teacher who taught her golf even persuaded her to give up the stage and win the golf championship.

She claims that she is not very interested in clothing and does not pay attention to it; and she never uses cosmetics except on stage. She rarely spends time dressing and doing her hair before performing a play.

She refused the suggestions that she go on screen. She does not want to leave the stage to spend time learning film techniques. She likes to "directly supply her spirit to the audience, and mingle with the audience's spirit, ...just like an electric current, through the footlights on the stage, linking the performer and the audience together."

Ms. Cornell does not hesitate to travel far for the audience. One year, she traveled with a troupe of fifty people while "performing three plays: "Candida", "The Barretts of Wimpole Street" and "The Age of Innocence". They traveled 16,000 miles and performed in seventy-five different places.

One Christmas Eve, they were delayed by floods and arrived in Seattle at 9:00 PM. They hoped to cancel the scheduled performance for that day, but they found that the people were eagerly waiting for them. So, everyone hurriedly rolled up the scenery under the gaze of the audience. Ms. Cornell officially took the stage at 1:10 AM. When the play ended, it was already 4:00 AM in the morning. (New US Information Office Manuscript)

### Ample Fuel in Various Regions, Assisting Industrial Production, Establishment of the Pingjin Coal and Iron Company

In order to supply the people of various regions with the coal they need, the North China Trade Corporation established the Pingjin Coal and Iron Company in Tianjin on March 30, appointing Li Nansheng as manager and Fan Juqiu as deputy manager. The scope of operations includes coal produced in Kailuan, Changcheng, Mentougou, Jingxing, Yangquan, and other places, as well as various raw and processed iron and raw materials, and handles coal and iron export matters. In addition to establishing the Second, Third, and Fourth Coal Mines of the Coal Industry Company in Tianjin, branch companies are established in Peiping, Baoding, and Qinhuangdao, offices are established in Tangshan, Tanggu, and Mentougou, and distribution offices are established in Shengfang and Zhengzhou.

Among the underground resources in North China, coal is the most abundant. According to the estimates of the Geological Survey Institute: the coal reserves in the seven provinces of North China total 212.5 billion metric tons, of which Shanxi and Hebei have the most, and all belong to the Paleozoic era. The thickness of the upper coal seam ranges from 100 meters to 220 meters, and the thickness of the lower coal seam ranges from 100 meters to 150 meters. If the land area and reserves are compared, there are about 156,000 metric tons per square kilometer, while the national calculation is about 22,000 metric tons per square kilometer. In terms of population, there are about 1,500 metric tons per person in North China, while the national average is about 550 metric tons per person.

Looking at the various mines under the management of the Pingjin Coal and Iron Company, the situation is as follows:

Mine Name Coal Quality Reserves Production

Kailuan Coking Coal 690 Million Tons 4 Million Tons

Changcheng Anthracite 70,000 Tons

Mentougou Anthracite 500,000 Tons

Jingxing Coking Coal 221 Million Tons 1 Million Tons

Yangquan Non-Coking Coal 200,000 Tons

Coal is the power and source of all productive enterprises, especially the quality of the mines in North China, which is superior to other places. Coking coal such as Kailuan and Jingxing is the best raw material for making coke. Non-coking coal is an excellent fuel for trains and other boilers, and has the reputation of solid gasoline. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese tried to refine artificial petroleum from coal using the low-temperature dry distillation method, and the results were said to be quite good.

After the liberation of the Pingjin area, the output of underground treasures has been increasing day by day. Now, the Pingjin Coal and Iron Company has been established to handle the distribution and marketing affairs, which will not only provide ample fuel for the people of various regions, but also make various industries flourish.

### Shanghai Branch of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee Issues a Letter to Fellow Citizens of Shanghai

The following is the text of the letter to fellow citizens of Shanghai from the Shanghai Provisional Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang: Dear fellow citizens of Shanghai: Now that Great Shanghai has been liberated, the day that we five million people have been expecting day and night has finally arrived. The liberation of Shanghai this time is not only a great victory for the People's Liberation Army, not only a victory for the united front of various democratic parties, but a victory for the five million people of Shanghai in resisting the dark forces. We must celebrate the liberation of Great Shanghai with excitement, and we must welcome the arrival of the People's Liberation Army with enthusiasm.

The reactionary government of the Chiang Kai-shek gang is a garbage group of warlords, bureaucrats, wealthy families, and compradors. They are all bloodsuckers, and they are doing everything possible, not for a minute, not for a second, not trying to suck the blood of the Chinese people to fatten themselves. In the counter-revolutionary war of massacring the people that they themselves launched, although they have failed miserably, the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek can still escape to South China, attempting to gather the remaining reactionary forces for a final struggle. Although the people of Shanghai have been liberated, there are still many compatriots throughout China living a life of slavery under the tyranny of the Chiang Kai-shek gang. Therefore, the people of Shanghai should be excited for victory and rejoice for liberation. However, after excitement and rejoicing, we must stand up firmly and continue to fight, completely eliminate all reactionary troops, and liberate the people of the whole country. At the same time, in Shanghai, we firmly believe that there must be many reactionary secret agents and war criminals lurking in the local area. They want to continue to massacre the people of Shanghai and hinder the progress of the Chinese liberation cause at all times and in all places. They are the enemies of our people. We must fight these lurking reactionary forces to the death, expose them, settle accounts with them, and completely eliminate them. The revolution must be carried through to the end. Revolution and reaction, light and darkness, cannot be compromised at all. Only after we have uprooted all reactionary forces can a new China of New Democracy emerge.

The content of New Democracy is the same as Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three Principles of the People. In the new China of New Democracy, everyone is equal, everyone has freedom, everyone has food to eat, and everyone has something to do. There is absolutely no phenomenon of people eating people. The purpose of the revolution is not destruction but construction. While we must continue to fight in the negative aspect to completely destroy the reactionary forces, we must also make redoubled efforts in the positive aspect to unite the hearts of 450 million people into one heart and unite the strength of 450 million people into one force, shedding blood and sweat, working together, and building a new democratic country. Shanghai is the economic center of the country, and Shanghai is the capital for building a new China. Our five million people of Shanghai should stand in front of the people of the whole country, each guarding their own post, increasing production, working actively, and shedding our last drop of blood and our last drop of sweat for building a new China. Our will must be firm, and our spirit must be aroused. Not a single drop of blood and not a single drop of sweat will be shed in vain.

Dear fellow citizens of Shanghai! The dark night has passed, and the day has dawned. From now on, we can live a democratic and free life. No one will suck our blood, and no one will eat our flesh. However, we still need to wage a difficult struggle against the remaining counter-revolutionary forces, and at the same time, we also need to wage a positive struggle to realize the new China of New Democracy.

### Shanghai Branch of the China Democratic League's Letter to Fellow Citizens for the Liberation of Shanghai

Let us cheer the great victory of the People's Liberation Army in liberating Shanghai! Since the Kuomintang reactionaries, with the assistance of US imperialism, violated the will of the people, broke the truce agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and launched a nationwide reactionary war against the Chinese people, our patriotic students, workers, and democrats have been arrested and shot, innocent civilians have been exploited and persecuted, schools have been destroyed, and industry and commerce have been squeezed to the point of disintegration, all of which are well known to our fellow citizens of Shanghai.

Our China Democratic League, because of its efforts for China's democracy, peace, unity, and unification, and its adherence to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, has been persecuted by the Kuomintang reactionary regime since 1937, and was declared illegal and dissolved by the Ministry of Interior of the reactionary government. Since then, thousands of League members have been illegally detained and killed throughout the country. However, the League headquarters was not subdued by coercion. After rebuilding the League headquarters in Hong Kong, it called on comrades throughout the country who had gone underground to fight to the end for the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-dictatorial democratic revolutionary united front. Our comrades, the League members in Shanghai, have never neglected this sacred work, even though they have always been in terror and danger. From now on, we must cooperate sincerely with our compatriots throughout the country, the Chinese Communist Party, and other democratic parties, and continue to work hard to resolutely and completely eliminate all reactionary forces within China, and liberate the people of the whole country.

The People's Liberation Army, which liberated Shanghai, is our people's own army, and will, under the principles of New Democracy, earnestly implement policies such as protecting the lives and property of the people, supporting national industry and commerce, cultivating cultural and educational undertakings, and improving the lives of workers and peasants. Our fellow citizens of Shanghai should stay at their posts, not be alarmed, abide by the laws and regulations of the democratic government, maintain social order, and expose special agents who conspire to sabotage. National banks and state-owned enterprises should continue to work as usual, awaiting takeover, shops should continue to operate as usual, factories should continue to start work as usual, schools should continue to attend classes as usual, develop production, prosper the economy, take into account both public and private interests, and benefit both labor and capital, in order to rebuild a new Shanghai and build a new China. The League is willing to encourage each other with fellow citizens from all walks of life!

Finally, we salute the hard-working and meritorious soldiers of the People's Liberation Army! We salute Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission! We salute all fellow citizens throughout the country who are fighting for the democratic revolution!

### "Atomic Doctor"

— Original by Hama

A medical story from the atomic age, proving that the same science that created the atomic bomb can prevent, rather than cause, suffering and death. When the battle on Sugar Loaf Hill on the island of Okinawa was taking place in May 1945, a U.S. Marine fell, seriously wounded. The medical team immediately gave him a blood transfusion, and he was saved. Before the end of the war, millions had been brought back to life in the same way. But without an "atomic doctor," the blood bank system could not have been established.

In the United States, a patient lay waiting for surgery to amputate his injured leg. Many doctors were discussing: could they preserve his knee joint? If the knee joint could be saved, and he was fitted with a prosthetic leg, he could walk almost as well as he used to. They needed to decide quickly.

They used a new technique to determine that the blood flow around his knee joint was normal, and it was sufficient to amputate the lower leg. Thanks to the "atomic doctor," this person could live a normal life.

In another hospital, a patient was dying from a seemingly incurable case of leukemia. But as a result of the same clever atomic doctor, this patient was finally discharged from the hospital, able to live at least a few more years of interested life.

Other atomic activities include quite successful treatments for thyroid and polycythemia, as well as disease diagnosis using radioisotopes obtained from splitting atoms. If these important studies continue to succeed, they will create an even greater era. Experiments are underway to turn atomic weapons against mankind's terrible enemies. Scientists are applying the radiation produced by atomic bombs in an attempt to find the roots of some of the most terrifying diseases and cancers. Before examining the research on atomic energy against cancer, we can take a look at what atomic medical tools are and how they have made the aforementioned achievements possible.

Medical researchers, using new atomic methods, have discovered that radioactive isotopes are a potential ally. An isotope of any chemical element is a chemical element that is heavier or lighter than the regular atom. But except for this difference in weight, the properties of isotopes are exactly the same as those of regular chemical elements. Of course, some elements are inherently radioactive, such as uranium. By utilizing the identical properties of isotopes and their ability to emit radiation, they can be made into valuable "tracers" in living tissues and used as a medical medium to carry radiation to parts of the body that are normally inaccessible.

In the decade before June 14, 1946, research groups found that obtaining even small amounts of radioactivity was both difficult and expensive. However, on that day, the U.S. Army announced that isotopes of one hundred different elements were now being produced in the chain-reaction uranium pile at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. These isotopes would be supplied in considerable quantities and at low cost for research, especially in medicine. As a result, the United States no longer needed to rely on the expensive and inefficient tools of the past. Many authorities immediately predicted that the abundant supply of isotopes would greatly accelerate the progress of atomic medicine.

But in the early days of World War II, there were not so many isotopes. Nevertheless, even the small quantities of isotopes available still produced many miracles. For example, at one point, the U.S. military medical authorities found it necessary to transport large quantities of blood from Asia to Europe and store it for long periods. Until then, no method had been found to keep blood cells alive for more than a few days. But the actual requirement was to find a way to preserve blood and keep it alive for more than three weeks, and this method needed to be found quickly. To find this method, it was necessary to test many chemical solutions and their properties, and testing many solutions would take a lot of time.

As a result, a group of physicists from MIT and Harvard solved this problem. Their solution was based on the fact that when iron compounds are injected into blood vessels, they are absorbed by hemoglobin molecules to produce red blood cells. Because of this phenomenon, they could use radioactive isotope iron to "trace" the behavior of blood stored in various solutions. Their first step was to produce iron isotopes in the atomic bomber in Massachusetts and then introduce a small amount of isotope iron into the blood vessels of the blood donor. Ten to fourteen days later, when the iron had been assimilated into the blood cells, blood was released from the blood donor and this same blood was introduced into various blood preservation solutions.

These solutions were then stored at various temperatures for considerable periods, and finally, blood transfusions were performed. After the transfusion, a device called a Geiger counter was used to check the radiation emitted by the isotopes in each recipient. If this radiation disappeared more quickly after the transfusion, it indicated that most of the red blood cells preserved in the solution had died, and the radioactive iron released from them had been eliminated from the blood more quickly.

Using this method to eliminate unsatisfactory chemical solutions, scientists in New Zealand quickly discovered an ABC solution, namely acid citrate dextrose, which could keep blood alive for 21 to 26 days in refrigerators at 40 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. As a result, this compound was quickly used to transport plasma and red blood cells to save more than 100,000 wounded soldiers in the Pacific. In some critical situations, some blood stored for 40 days was still successfully used for transfusions.

Examining various parts of the body to determine whether surgery is necessary by employing a "tracing" technique. This technique involves injecting radioactive isotopes into the blood and then using a "Geiger counter" to observe the travel of those radioactive particles. In a situation where blood circulation is good and tissues are vigorously absorbing the food and oxygen they desperately need, amputation is not necessary.

The two examples of atomic medicine cited here use radioactivity to explore the condition of living cells. If a stronger dose of isotopes is used, it can destroy diseased and malignant growths in human tissue. Leukemia is a disease that can cause the bone marrow to produce an improper large amount of white blood cells. This disease can be temporarily cured by injecting large amounts of concentrated isotopes. The leukemia patient mentioned above was later temporarily cured by injecting radioactive phosphorus. The radiation emitted by radioactive phosphorus reduces the activity of the bone marrow, and the number of white blood cells gradually decreases. After continuous injections, this patient was finally discharged from the hospital, and he could at least have a considerable period without pain.

Another disease is polycythemia, which is characterized by an excess of red blood cells. This disease can also be alleviated by using radioactive phosphorus. Hyperthyroidism can also be treated with radioactive isotopes. Since the thyroid gland absorbs 99% of the iodine in the body, doctors can safely use radioactive iodine.

The recent achievements in atomic medicine are too numerous to mention. You have noticed that the occurrence of diseases such as leukemia, polycythemia, and hyperthyroidism is due to the fact that certain tissues grow a larger quantity of products than the normal amount. We can compare this with the definition of cancer, "cancer" is a chaotic situation caused by the frantic and rapid growth of cells in the body, which destroys important organs. Clearly, this has already reminded people of the similarity in degree between cancer and the above-mentioned diseases, and those diseases have been proven to be resolved by atomic medicine.

### Postscript to the National Women's Congress

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] On March 24th, the first National Congress of Chinese Women was convened in Peiping. The representatives participating included women representatives from the liberated areas of the Northwest, Northeast, North China, East China, and Central Plains, as well as the areas ruled by the Kuomintang, and even overseas Chinese women representatives. It can be described as a grand event in the revolutionary history of Chinese women.

The congress lasted for eleven days and achieved very fruitful results. The meeting decided to issue a declaration in response to the World Congress for the Defense of Peace, and elected representatives to attend other important cases. When discussing the current direction and tasks of the Chinese women's movement, the representatives became even more enthusiastic, vying to speak. Regarding the direction of the women's movement, everyone unanimously supported Deng Yingchao's opinions and propositions. She said, "Without relaxing the work of rural women, focus on the work of urban women." She also said, "The task of women's work is mainly to mobilize and organize women of all strata to participate in production." The women worker representatives unanimously expressed on the spot that they would work harder in production in the future, set an example, and be heroes in the construction of the New China. The representatives from the countryside were also very happy to hear this. Liu Jinying, a rural labor hero from the Northwest liberated area, said at a group meeting, "Rural women have already had tasks, and now urban women also have tasks. The congress must cooperate and learn from each other in order to promote the work, and the national victory can be realized sooner."

On April 3rd, the eleventh day after the opening of the congress, which was also the closing day, the scheduled tasks were completed in a grand and solemn ceremony. On that day, Commander Zhu De and Mayor Ye Jianying of Peiping City also attended the meeting. The congress presented Commander Zhu De with two red flags dedicated to the people's leaders, Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander Zhu De. Commander Zhu De received the flags from the congress. The flag dedicated to Chairman Mao Zedong read, "Forever follow you forward." The flag dedicated to Commander Zhu De read, "Without the victory of today's People's Liberation Army, there would be no liberation of Chinese women." After receiving the flags, Commander Zhu De addressed the representatives, hoping that they would go back, unite women across the country, complete the New Democratic Revolution, and build a New China. After Lei Jieqiong delivered the closing speech, Mayor Ye Jianying also spoke in succession.

The day the National Congress of Chinese Women closed was also the day the All-China Democratic Women's Federation was declared established. On the previous day, the congress elected 51 members of the Executive Committee of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, leaving four vacancies to be filled after the national liberation. At the congress on the 3rd, Chairman Liu Yaxiong announced the list of elected members and declared the birth of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, which won applause from the audience. The list of 51 executive committee members is as follows: Cai Chang, Deng Yingchao, He Xiangning, Zhang Qinqiu, Kang Keqing, Qu Mengjue, Yang Zhihua, Liu Yaxiong, Shuai Mengqi, Luo Qiong, Xu Guangping, Zhang Yun, Yang Yunyu, Zhang Jinbao, Li Peizhi, Li Dequan, Tian Xiujuan, Chen Shaomin, Ding Ling, Shen Zijiu, Xie Xuehong, Luo Shuzhang, Zhang Xiuyan, Li Wenyi, Lu Cui, Zeng Mengjun, Wulan, Qian Zhengying, Yang Gang, Wang Yuecun, Lei Jieqiong, Li Jianzhen, Yang Zhifang, Zhang Zifang, Li Zhen, Feng Qiuming, Li Fenglian, Qi Yuande, Zhao Feng, Yang Kebing, Hu Ziying, Zhao Shilan, Li Boying, Zhang Xiaomei, Liu Wang Liming, Han Qimin, Qiu Yihan, Deng Kang, Chen Boke, Jiang Yi.

The National Congress of Chinese Women and the All-China Women's Federation are, in form, the first major union of revolutionary women. In fact, since the post-"May Fourth" period, Chinese women have participated in the revolutionary struggle alongside workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals for more than 30 years. Deng Yingchao, deputy director of the preparatory committee for the first National Congress of Chinese Women, praised it in a broadcast on the Xinhua Radio Station in Peiping on March 27th. She said, "The heroic and tenacious spirit of Chinese working women in the revolution has made a significant contribution to the Chinese revolution and has become an indispensable force." During the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, the vast number of women in the liberated areas gathered together and responded to the call of the Chinese Communist Party, participating in various anti-Japanese works with a selfless spirit. He pointed out that during the two and a half years of the war, 50% to 60% of the total number of women with labor capacity were mobilized to support the front lines, mobilize to join the army, or participate in production. Women's efforts to participate in labor production have achieved good results. In particular, the sideline production of rural women, namely spinning and weaving, has greatly increased after the launch of the self-sufficiency movement to ensure military and civilian needs. After 1948, the production of the rear was mainly relied on by women, thus greatly improving the status of women.

### Northeast · North China: Advancing Towards Construction

Northeast Public Enterprises Launch Competition Movement

[Pan Yang Dispatch] The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions recently called on workers in Northeast public enterprises to launch a production competition movement. During the competition, all industries will deliberate and handle matters based on their specific circumstances. Those who win the competition will be awarded certificates and prizes. At the same time, it is pointed out how leadership should engage in backlog preparation.

[Pan Yang Dispatch] Public enterprises in various parts of the Northeast are generally launching large-scale production competition movements to welcome the "May 1st" Labor Day. The Harbin Electrical Repair Factory has completed four months of production tasks within two months since the competition began on February 1st. The bleaching powder department of the factory originally planned to produce 90 tons of bleaching powder in March, but by March 24th, it had produced 110 tons (the highest monthly output during the puppet Manchukuo period was 108 tons). The monthly output of hydrochloric acid in the factory has reached 118 tons, exceeding the monthly output during the puppet Manchukuo era by 28 tons. The repair department is striving to complete the repair plan for the first half of 1949 two months ahead of schedule by "May 1st". The No. 2 mine of the Northeast Third Coal Mining Area adopts the method of individual and group order plans, and conducts competitions with the pit entrance as a unit. In the first eight days of March, the total output of the mine reached 3,216 tons, exceeding the planned 22%. During the competition, the No. 1 Coal Mining Area of the mine has made great improvements in mining methods. For example, the daily output of a coal mining tunnel in the No. 1 pit has increased from more than 100 tons to more than 200 tons due to changes in mining methods, and the mining rate has increased from 30% to 60%. Since the launch of the competition in the Sunjiawan Mine of the Fuxin Coal Mining Bureau, the amount of coal mined has increased from an average of three tons per person per day to six tons. The amount of coal mined by worker Cui Yi has increased to ten tons. Due to the timely praise and criticism through blackboards and active improvement of workers' meals in the Northeast Woolen Mill during the competition, both output and quality have been improved. The output of a cotton weaving department of the factory has increased from 140 pieces of cotton cloth per day to 200 pieces. The Jinzhou Railway Bureau Locomotive Section strives to complete two typical locomotives in early April. In other industrial cities such as Andong, Jilin, Changchun, Qiqihar, and Mudanjiang, the workers of public enterprises such as railways, military industries, textiles, rubber, paper making, and electricity are also actively working hard to complete the competition plan.

Railways, Mines, and Factories Cultivate Technical Workers

[Pan Yang Dispatch] Railways, mines, and factories in Pan Yang, Harbin, Fushun, and other places are cultivating technical workers and organizing technical studies in a planned way to improve technology and quality. Among the 160 artisans in the machinery branch of the Huanggu Tun Railway Factory in Pan Yang, unskilled artisans account for 30% of the total. Therefore, training technical workers is a major task of the branch. The factory administration first conducts education for technical workers, focusing on breaking their old concepts of conservative technology, and then absorbs the opinions of foremen, team leaders, and veteran technical workers to formulate methods for training technical workers: (1) Change the past phenomenon of not giving unskilled artisans single beds, and let him be solely responsible for one, with foremen, team leaders, and veteran technical workers providing more specific help to make him more proficient faster. (2) Try to make helpers and unskilled workers first do simple work, and then gradually go from shallow to deep. (3) Organize technical studies, compile helpers, unskilled workers, and apprentices into several groups, and let veteran technical workers take turns explaining technical theories. The factory has now started according to the above methods. According to the opinions of the workers' representatives, Pan Yang Automobile No. 11 Factory organized a spare-time technical training class for employees without affecting production. Technicians and experienced workers served as teachers, and adopted a teaching method that focused on practical technology to help workers learn automobile construction, repair methods, electrical engineering, and fault inspection methods. The Harbin Machinery Iron Factory established a technical research association. The research center focuses on working methods, practical difficulties encountered in production, how to identify various materials and their properties, and how to use tools and machines. After the problems in production were raised to the research association by the red furnace and sand turning teams, the experienced workers exchanged technical opinions and solved many forging methods by doing and researching at the same time, and improved the quality of finished products. The factory decided that members who have achieved certain achievements in research may be rewarded as model researchers after being publicly elected by the research association and approved by the factory management committee. In order to improve the oil production technology and theoretical knowledge of employees, the Fushun Coal Mining Bureau Oil Refinery is actively carrying out the translation of relevant materials. At the same time, in order to solve the difficulties of technicians in lubricating oil, gasoline, sulfur, paraffin, etc., the factory is planning to run various technical training courses.

Fushun Electrical Porcelain Factory Output Reaches Highest Peak

[Pan Yang Dispatch] The Fushun Electrical Porcelain Factory has manufactured a total of 216,000 high and low voltage insulating porcelain pieces in three months, with an average monthly output of more than 62,000 pieces, creating the factory's highest record in the fourteen years since its establishment. During the puppet Manchukuo period, the factory's highest record was an average monthly output of 32,000 pieces. At present, the quality of products has also been greatly improved. The finished products account for 84% of the burnt volume. In the most recent burn, the finished products even increased to 94.4%. These achievements of the factory are mainly the result of workers' high enthusiasm for production. The factory is now working hard to complete the plan to produce 250,000 high-voltage electrical porcelain pieces in the next four months.

[Tianjin Dispatch] Under the correct leadership of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government and the Preparatory Office of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, the labor-capital relations of the two major private yarn factories in Tianjin, Hengyuan and Beiyang, have been initially improved. The output of the Hengyuan Yarn Factory has reached the pre-liberation level. The output of the Beiyang Yarn Factory has increased by more than 15% compared to when it was just liberated. Therefore, the Hengyuan Yarn Factory produces an average of 45 pieces of 20-count yarn per day, 400 pounds per piece, and 400 bolts of cloth, which is 68% higher than the output when it was just liberated. The Beiyang Yarn Factory now produces an average of 37 pieces of yarn per day. Because the labor-capital relations have been reasonably resolved, the phenomenon of wasting raw materials has also been greatly reduced. The factories of the two factories are vigorously searching for raw materials and actively expanding production.

Tianjin Production Advances Rapidly Exceeding Target

[Tianjin Dispatch] Public enterprise units such as the Zhang Guizhuang Railway Factory and the Xiangjiao Parts Factory in Tianjin City have successfully completed or exceeded the production plan for March. The Tianjin Machinery Factory exceeded the original plan by 8% to 80% in the repair work of freight cars, passenger cars, and automobiles. It repaired a tractor with waste materials. The automobile tires and battery boxes produced by the Rubber Parts Factory have all completed the plan. The inner and outer tires of bicycles exceeded the plan by 10% to 20%. Most of the products of the Tianjin Automobile Manufacturing Plant were completed on schedule. Storage batteries and Jemsi piston rings also exceeded the plan. The Tianjin Automobile Repair Factory completed the plan to repair 82 cars, including 40 major repairs, exceeding the number of major repairs in February by 60%. Seven workers in the water meter repair room of the waterworks were sent to study, and they repaired 236 water meters, which was 36 more than the original plan, and 67 more than in February. The work of installing water meters and repairing air pumps in the pipe room of the same factory has exceeded the plan. The car repair work of the Hebei Car Repair Factory of the Public Transport Management Office has also been successfully completed. The employees of various enterprises have shown a high degree of enthusiasm in their work, voluntarily extending working hours, making full use of waste materials to improve technology and management, and overcoming many difficulties. Some factory workers have also launched a production competition. This is the key to completing and exceeding the production plan, but the production plan of individual enterprises has not been completed because it is not based on actual production capacity and has not mobilized employees to discuss.

[Another Dispatch] After the liberation of Tianjin, under the active leadership and assistance of the People's Government, public and private factories quickly resumed work to cooperate with the national liberation war and the general goal of developing production and prospering the economy. Before liberation, Dasheng Factory was subjected to various oppressions and exclusions from imperialism and bureaucratic capital, and tried its best to squeeze the workers in the factory. After liberation, with the help of the People's Government, the factory officially resumed work on January 19. The factory's workers' work group, on the one hand, persuaded the capitalists to gradually liberate the workers' reasonable demands according to the actual situation, and on the other hand, vigorously implemented the education policy and made appropriate adjustments. At the same time, it announced the dissolution of the trade union, stopped all activities of the trade union leader, and cleansed the individual trade union leaders who had done many evils and were deeply hated by the people.

Due to the above reasons, the production enthusiasm of employees has increased day by day. The phenomenon of late arrival and early departure of ordinary workers has been eliminated. The workers of the preservation section have tried every means to increase production, pieced together the empty spindles on the spinning frame, and completed the seven-day task in four days. In the case of extreme difficulty in raw materials and parts, Zhao Jiming, a worker in the leather stick room, quickly completed the leather sticks for the air force. In the past, if the workers in the electrical department repaired the large motor in the steel wire room, it would take at least four hours for six people, but now it only takes two hours. The workers in the repair section rushed to make 80 iron baskets and lead wire baskets in 20 days to replace the bamboo baskets. The iron baskets are much more durable than the bamboo baskets, but the price is 200 yuan cheaper than the bamboo baskets. In terms of saving raw materials, the workers voluntarily cleaned up the cotton on the ground, and there were very few broken threads on the yarn splices. Because the workers in the spinning room can consciously cherish materials, the average daily loss of 85 pairs of leather sticks is reduced to 40 pairs. The workers in the shafting machine used waste materials and spent three days to research and improve, and can save more than ten pounds of cotton per week. The production management personnel also assumed their due responsibilities, and some actively helped the workers to sort out the machines and roll the cotton yarn. Therefore, the output and quality of the factory have exceeded the normal production level before liberation, and reached an unprecedented level. For example, before liberation, the factory produced an average of 0.031 pounds of 20-count yarn per spindle per hour. Now, it produces an average of 0.0345 pounds of 20-count yarn per spindle per hour, which is 11.2% higher than before liberation. There has also been significant improvement in quality. The cotton yarn is white and uniform. Therefore, the sales are very good, and the market price per package (400 pounds) is 1,000 to 2,000 yuan higher than before.

Private Factories Revived Half Have Been Restored

[Tianjin Dispatch] Through the joint efforts of the Fourth District Work Group and relevant departments, 19 of the 42 factories in the Fourth District had resumed work by early April, and another 14 factories were actively preparing to start work. Only nine factories were unable to start work in the short term due to damage by artillery fire or lack of responsible persons.

After the liberation of Tianjin, the capitalists of general factories did not understand the industrial and commercial policies of the People's Government. Therefore, only eight of the 42 factories in the Fourth District started production until late February. The district government convened a symposium for the persons in charge of each factory on February 23. In addition to explaining the industrial and commercial policies by the staff, the persons in charge of several factories that had already started work were also in charge of explaining their experience and views. This meeting was very effective, so that some factory owners understood that "both labor and capital benefit" is a decision made by both labor and capital after democratic discussion, and both parties must agree. Their concerns were reduced, and eleven companies resumed operations within half a month after the meeting.

Most of the other factories in the Fourth District that have not been able to start work do not have labor-capital disputes.

Laiyang Improves Life and Organizes Production Promotion Society

[Laiyang Dispatch] Laiyang City is a relatively developed industrial and commercial city in eastern Shandong. It is a distribution center for peanuts, taro, ramie, and chestnuts. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, it was subjected to long-term looting and searching by the enemy and puppets, making people's lives difficult and hard. Stores closed down and factories went bankrupt. In August 1945, Laiyang was liberated, and the democratic government distributed relief grain and relief loans, and people's lives began to improve.

At the beginning of July 1946, when the Production Promotion Society was established, the working principles and business were not yet specific, but the principles were determined to "support the production of the masses and serve the masses."

In September, the Promotion Society left the countryside and moved into the city, determining that the future business would be to develop the textile industry.

The Production Promotion Society encountered difficulties and tried to solve these problems so that the textile industry could develop.

(1) Proactively contact the district and village, communicate the relationship, and jointly establish a production promotion committee to unify the research and deployment of production work in the urban area.

(2) Specifically grasp the typical people to promote externally and develop the number of spinners.

(3) Use reward methods to gradually improve technology, stimulate the development of spinners, improve the quality of spun yarn, and improve the enthusiasm of spinning women.

(4) Solve difficulties in a timely manner, help develop, and ensure the timely supply of raw materials.

Because the Promotion Society properly and correctly solved the above four problems, the textile industry in the city expanded to Shannanguan Village, Rulin Village, and then to Heping Village, and by the end of the year it was popularized to every village.

### A Perspective on Northeast Agriculture

Under the leadership of the Northeast Administrative Committee and the awards of the People's Government, various parts of Northeast China have actively increased agricultural production, such as increasing grain production, carrying out sideline production, manufacturing agricultural tools, and logging timber, and have achieved significant results. According to the Xinhua News Agency's repeated release of telecommunications, a collection of descriptions is as follows!

Strengthen Spring Cultivation Work Actively Increase Grain Production

In order to strengthen the leadership of the organization of spring cultivation work and mobilize and organize the masses to actively produce, the Northeast Administrative Committee issued an agricultural production order, notifying governments at all levels to quickly mobilize cadres, mobilize and organize the masses to actively engage in production, and strive to complete the increase of 1.8 million dan of grain this year. The production order pointed out that "recognizing that all feudal properties that have been distributed belong to private individuals, allowing individuals to freely operate, and issuing land certificates and house certificates to determine land rights and house rights, ensuring that their own labor employs people to operate normal interest income and under specific regulations, the income from renting land completely belongs to them, and guaranteeing freedom of exchange, no one may infringe." In addition, regulations have also been made on basic issues related to agricultural production.

The Northeast Administrative Committee plans to sow 3 million mu of paddy fields in the Northeast this spring. Last year, there were only more than 2.11 million mu of paddy fields in the Northeast, and this year, 880,000 mu will be restored and increased. It is estimated that 149,000 tons of grain can be produced this autumn.

Organize Farmers in Various Places to Carry Out Sideline Production

The democratic governments of the newly liberated areas of Liaoning, Liaoxi, and Rehe provinces are organizing farmers to carry out sideline production and preparing for spring cultivation. The Liaoyang County Government has sent work teams to distribute disaster relief grain to areas with severe disasters, and organize disaster victims to use the loan grain to carry out production such as gold panning, logging, charcoal burning, and fishing. With the help of the government, the farmers in the suburbs of Yingkou City organized 594 production groups to carry out production such as salt transportation, fishing, manure collection, and transportation, which has initially solved the lives of more than 27,000 people. Some farmers have also purchased livestock, etc., and are actively preparing for spring cultivation. According to the characteristics of the developed textile industry in Xin Hui and other places in Rehe Province, the People's Government lent grain and cotton seed money to disaster victims as capital for spring cultivation. On the one hand, the local cooperatives lent 17,500 jin of cotton and 29 looms, and mobilized more than 20,700 women to participate in textile. The counties in western Liaoning generally mobilized disaster victims to weave mats and textiles. Most areas have solved the problem of food for three or four months.

Public Mechanical Farms Are in High Spirits for Production

The spring cultivation preparation work of the twelve public mechanical farms in various parts of the Northeast is nearing completion, and they will soon be able to start cultivating. The four mechanical farms directly operated by the Agriculture Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee, namely, the Heilongjiang Provincial, the Hegjiang Provincial Dong'an, the Nenjiang Provincial, and the Pan Yang Masanjiazi, have prepared and repaired the houses and cultivated the roads and bridges in the spring cultivation. They are currently disinfecting seeds and will start plowing and spring cultivation only after the land thaws. The above four farms have a total of 5,450 mu of arable land and 52 tractors. In addition, the spring cultivation preparation work of the eight mechanical farms in Songjiang, Hegjiang, Nenjiang, Heilongjiang, Liaobei, Liaoning, Jilin and other seven provinces is also coming to an end. These eight farms have a total of 10,700 mu of arable land, 108 tractors, and other new types of agricultural tools. Recently, the Agriculture Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee has supplemented a total of 140 tons of gasoline and 360 tons of seed oil according to the needs of tractors and fuel in various farms. At the same time, it also allocated 310 tons of wheat seeds to sow coal in time after Qingming. At present, the trade unions of various public farms have also been established, and the agricultural workers are in high spirits for production.

Manufacture Large Quantities of Agricultural Tools to Increase Agricultural Production

Under the awards of the People's Government, farmers and public agricultural tool manufacturing factories in various parts of Northeast China have created and transformed many agricultural tools to improve agricultural productivity. Zhao Jinzhang, a farmer in Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, manufactured a horse-drawn seeder that can automatically till the soil. This seeder has been proven to save labor and sow quickly after testing. The Yingnong Tool Factory in Heilongjiang Province is now manufacturing and promoting it in large quantities for adoption in various places. In addition, the weeding machine manufactured by the factory has also been successfully tested and is being distributed to various places for use by the Provincial Department of Agriculture in a planned manner. The Farmer Experimental Station in Nehe County, Nenjiang Province, has also recently created a single-limit seeder and a weeding seeder. The effect is that the ordinary seeding method can save three man-days and one horse-day. The weeding seeder saves five man-days compared with the manual weeding method. More than 10,000 sets of these two newly created agricultural tools have been manufactured and are being promoted to areas lacking manpower and livestock. Jin Zisheng, a labor model in Linjiang County, Andong Province, transformed ordinary plows into wasteland plows with three bayonets. After testing, it was found that the new plow can save one-third of the labor compared with the ordinary wasteland reclamation method, and can increase the efficiency of wasteland reclamation by three times. The Linjiang County Agricultural Tool Factory has manufactured enough sets of this new plow, and the government has lent it to farmers for use. In addition, agricultural tool factories in Hegjiang, Jilin, Liaoning and other provinces have also recently rushed to manufacture a large number of new types of agricultural tools, preparing to lend them to farmers in various places before spring cultivation.

Logging Task Completed Huge Amounts of Timber Awaiting Transportation

The task of logging 4 million cubic meters of timber in the winter in the entire Northeast region has been completed. The forestry bureaus of various provinces are now working intensively to organize transportation. The task of transporting this huge amount of timber is planned to be completed by the end of this year. Among the 4 million cubic meters of timber, 1.63 million cubic meters are transported by forest railways, 1.8 million cubic meters are transported by rafting, 430,000 cubic meters require double transportation by rafting and forest railways, and the rest are transported by horse-drawn carriages and livestock. In order to complete the transportation task quickly, the forestry bureaus of various provinces will launch a rushing transportation competition movement. The Northeast Forestry General Bureau has allocated huge bonuses to reward transportation models.

### A Young Team Student Union in "Struggle"

[Special Article from This Newspaper] At the beginning of March this year, student representatives from all over the country convened the 14th National Student Congress of the All-China Students' Federation in Beijing, the birthplace of the "May Fourth" Movement, and held this grand meeting on the eve of the victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution.

On May 6, 1919, that is, the third day after the outbreak of the "May Fourth" Movement, the "Beijing Federation of Students Above Secondary Level" was established under the auspices of middle and high school students in Beijing, and at the same time, students from all over the country were to organize their own national organizations. On the 16th of the same month, student representatives from all over the country convened the First National Student Congress of the All-China Students' Federation in Shanghai. The "General Federation of Students of the Republic of China" was produced at the meeting. From 1919 to 1928, the organization that led the Chinese student movement held nine national student congresses under the persecution of counter-revolutionary feudal remnants. Students from all over the country actively participated in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary struggle. Taking the "May Thirtieth" Movement in 1925 as an example, it was one of the examples of heroic struggle.

In October 1929, the Central Training Department of the Kuomintang ordered the "General Federation of Students of the Republic of China" to stop its activities. It was not until the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War of "September 18" and "January 28" that the Chinese student movement entered a new stage. Then the "December 9th" Movement in 1935 broke out.

In the spring of 1936, another national student congress opened in Shanghai, re-establishing the Chinese Students' Federation, but in fact it was the "First National Student Congress of the All-China Students' Federation," calling for a comprehensive anti-Japanese war. Since then, the Twelfth and Thirteenth National Student Congresses of the All-China Students' Federation were held in Wuhan in the summer of 1938, advocating adhering to the resistance to the end and opposing compromise and surrender, and in Shanghai in June 1947 to launch an anti-hunger and anti-civil war movement. Its work and activities have been unfolding.

### North China Agriculture and Forestry Construction

This Year's Agricultural Production Plan

The North China People's Government has announced the agricultural production plan for the North China Liberated Area for 1949. This plan was drafted by the North China Department of Agriculture, studied and passed by the North China Agricultural and Forestry Conference, and then approved and announced by the North China People's Government Committee. The guiding principle of the plan is to increase grain production and ensure the supply of raw materials for industry. Based on this principle, the plan stipulates that the entire North China region should increase grain production by 7.5 million shi (誤 corrected to 1.5 million dan of grain, originally mistranslated), which is an average increase of five shi sheng per mu; increase cotton (seed cotton) production by 130 million jin, so that the total cotton harvest for the year will increase to 300 million jin; and for oil crops such as peanuts and hemp, the goal is to achieve a total harvest of 933 million jin for the year. To increase cotton and oil crop production, the plan stipulates expanding the cotton field area by 70 percent, meaning planting 12 million mu of cotton in the entire region. The plan calls for 4 million mu for peanuts among the oil crops. The plan compensates for the reduced grain output due to the planting of cotton and oil crops by planting more potatoes, sweet potatoes, and other high-yield crops. To ensure the smooth completion of the entire production increase plan, the specific measures are as follows: (1) Solve the difficulties of labor and animal power. First, extensively organize labor mutual aid, and mobilize more than half of the women's full labor force in the entire region to participate in major agricultural labor. Second, greatly increase livestock. The plan stipulates that in the Wutai Mountain area, Shun Mountain area, Huo Mountain area, and Langxi area of ​​Hebei-Shandong-Henan, the masses should be organized to breed 242,000 head of livestock, and on this basis, strive to restore the number of draft animals to pre-war levels within five years. (2) Vigorously prevent and control floods, and expand the area of ​​irrigated land by 2 million mu through methods such as repairing water conservancy facilities, digging canals, and drilling wells. Public areas should repair and increase 66,000 new waterwheels to facilitate the development of water conservancy construction. (3) Organize farmers to increase fertilizer. This is one of the main conditions for achieving increased production requirements. In areas with a foundation for manure accumulation, fertilizer should be increased by 50% this year, and in areas with poorer conditions, it should be increased by 15%. To increase fertilizer, all localities should universally organize farmers to raise pigs and sheep. There are 1.5 million sheep in Taihang, Taiyue, and Beiyue. This year, this number should be increased to 2 million. (4) Local governments and farms should vigorously assist farmers in preventing and controlling pests and promote improved varieties. This year, we must ensure that there will be no large-scale locust plagues or other insect disasters. To this end, the plan stipulates that all localities should apply a large number of locally produced insecticides. This year, the entire North China region should promote the cultivation of 360,380 mu of improved varieties of wheat, Sizi cotton, and rice. (5) The entire region should help farmers increase the number of hammers, plows, hoes, and other agricultural tools by 4.15 million pieces, and universally establish agricultural tool repair stations to assist farmers in repairing agricultural tools, and further help farmers improve agricultural tools. (6) Expand the cultivated area. The entire region should eliminate 600,000 mu of wasteland. In mountainous areas, terracing is encouraged. In the barren areas of southern Hebei, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and other plains, tractors are used to reclaim wasteland on a trial basis. In addition, the plan stipulates that local governments should mobilize farmers to vigorously plant trees and develop sideline production such as textiles, transportation, medicinal herb collection, mat weaving, and straw hat braiding.

This Year's Afforestation Plan

The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the North China People's Government has formulated this year's afforestation plan for the entire North China region. The plan prepares to plant more than 24 million trees in the entire region, including the establishment of windbreak forest belts and universal afforestation in barren mountains and sandy wastelands, and prepare to establish more than 2,700 mu of nurseries to supply the seedlings needed for afforestation. In order to effectively complete the afforestation plan, the North China People's Government decided to set up a specialized organization to lead and manage forestry and issue forestry loans of 100 million yuan in Renminbi.

Hebei Central, Southern Hebei, Taihang and other places planted a large number of trees. Hebei Central and Taihang Administrative Offices have organized afforestation teams to various sandy areas, in cooperation with local party and government leading organs, to lead the masses in planting trees and afforestation, and plan to cultivate a large number of windbreak forests in the sandy areas of the Shahe River and Yongding River. Sixteen villages along the Shahe River in Xinle County, Hebei Central, planted 90,000 trees in the week from March 4th to 11th. Xizheng Village in Tang County, led by the village chief, primary school teachers and others, formed a forest protection committee to lead the village's afforestation and forest protection work, and led the planting of more than 3,200 trees on March 5th and 6th, forming three windbreak forest belts. The village has made a plan for afforestation in two seasons. Southern Hebei District specially stipulated March 16th to 22nd as the afforestation movement week. Yu Family Village, a village of 70 households in Yuanchao (newly established county, parts of Daming and Chaocheng) County in the district, planted 83,000 trees in sandy wasteland this spring. This year, afforestation in various places has generally corrected the shortcomings of the past, such as emphasizing collective afforestation, only planting trees without protecting them, and pursuing quantity regardless of the survival rate, and adopted the method of freely forming small groups to plant trees on their own land, so the enthusiasm of the masses for planting trees is very high.

Issuing Agricultural Loans

In order to encourage cotton planting, the Shijiazhuang City Supply and Marketing Cooperative specially issued cotton planting loans of 3.3 million yuan in Renminbi, and adopted the method of lending out real goods and repaying with real goods, that is, lending out seeds and fertilizers, and recovering seed cotton and lint. In the past half month, the cooperative has purchased more than 100,000 jin of cotton seeds and more than 480,000 jin of fertilizers, which will be distributed by the suburban supply and marketing cooperatives in the near future.

The branches and sub-branches of the Shandong Beihai Bank have recently decided to issue agricultural loans of more than 69.16 million jin of grain and 140 million yuan of Beihai currency to help farmers increase grain production and produce industrial raw materials. The Luzhongnan Branch of Beihai Bank stipulates that the issuance steps should be based on the production season, first issuing loans for agricultural tools and draught cattle to meet the needs of spring plowing, then issuing seed loans, and finally issuing loans for hoes and some seeds to solve the difficulties of hoeing and replanting. The branch also solved the problem of helping local cooperatives establish credit departments through the issuance of loans. The Bohai Administrative Office also issued instructions stipulating that loans should first be used to solve the difficulties of promoting the planting of cotton, peanuts, and other crops with fertilizers and seeds. The instructions from the Jiaodong Administrative Office specifically pointed out that when issuing draught cattle loans, the amount of loans must be controlled according to the amount of market sources to avoid panic purchases and stimulate price increases.

### Resumption of Various Routes Not Far Off The Ships Sunk at the Bottom of the River Can Be Salvaged China Merchants Bureau Awaits Takeover

[This Newspaper] Before the People's Liberation Army arrived in the city, the ships of various shipping companies left on the Huangpu River received an order from the "Kyoto-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters" requiring them to sail out of the Wusongkou by 2:00 p.m. on the 20th to 7:00 p.m. on the 21st, otherwise they must be destroyed and sunk. At that time, China Oil Tanker Company had a total of nine oil tankers in Shanghai. Because they did not have time to sail out, four of them, "Yonghan", "Yonghuai", "Yongtao", and "Yongluo", were automatically sunk. There were also five ships, "Yongxiang", "Yonghuang", "Yongyu", "Yongwei", and "Yongxiao", that were not destroyed. In addition, the "Minben", "Minxiang", and "Minwan" ships of Minsheng Company, and the Jiangchang ship of the Dada Datong Joint Venture were also sunk at the bottom of the river. However, the Yangtze River ships "Jiangling" and "Jianghua" of the China Merchants Bureau, although they did not have time to sail out, remained in the Huangpu River and were not destroyed. The bureau's general manager Hu Shiyuan and deputy general managers Huang Muzong and Shen Zhongyi have not left Shanghai and are waiting for the People's Liberation Army to take over. The several sunken ships can be salvaged, so the expected date of resumption of the Beiyang Line, the Yangtze River Line, the Northern Jiangsu Line, and the Eastern Zhejiang, Shanghai-Ningbo, and Shanghai-Ou lines is not far off.

Workers from all sectors are faithfully implementing the New Democratic urban policies. The Shanghai Journalists' Union yesterday issued a public letter to the citizens as follows:

Shanghai is liberated today! The heroic People's Liberation Army has officially entered the city! Six million people of Shanghai are now freed from the Kuomintang's brutal and reactionary rule. With boundless enthusiasm, we extend our highest respect to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

The Kuomintang's reactionary regime is on the verge of total collapse, but Shanghai still harbors remnant armed forces and conspirators. We must unite all workers and the people of the city, heighten our vigilance, and thoroughly eradicate their poison. We must protect production machinery and strive for a new democratic society, preventing conspirators from sabotaging it.

Today is the first day of our liberation, and also the starting point of our dedication to the cause of liberation. We shout:

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live Chairman Mao!

Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

Long live all commanders and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army!

Long live the workers of Shanghai!

### Refugees Fleeing Shanghai from the Western Suburbs and Pudong Began Returning to Their Hometowns Yesterday

[Reported by this Newspaper] Since the outbreak of war in the western district, residents originally living in areas such as Caohejing, Hongqiao, Qibao, and Tushanwan have mostly moved their families into the city, staying with relatives and friends. For a time, along Xuhui Road, people carrying suitcases and bundles, supporting the old and leading the young, were constantly on the move. However, since Shanghai was liberated yesterday, they have all been moving from east to west, returning to the suburbs, which is the opposite of the previous situation.

Furthermore, when the war situation in Pudong was tense a few days ago, many residents fled to the city with the old and the young. Yesterday, after the liberation of Shanghai, the urban area and Pudong have become one. The Pudong refugees are all planning to return home. However, because the city ferry has not yet resumed, some people are hiring wooden boats to cross the river, valuing their homes after the disaster.

### The Municipal Police Bureau Completed Takeover; Volunteer Police Assist in Maintaining Order

The Municipal Police Bureau was taken over by Xu Xu, the principal of Daren Middle School, at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. The New City, Huangpu, Songshan, Changshu, Jiangning, and Putuo police sub-bureaus in the urban area were also taken over by the People's Liberation Army, which stationed troops for guard duty.

Acting Police Chief Lu Dagong, in addition to preparing for the handover at the headquarters yesterday morning, also did his best to maintain the city's public security. From 8:00 a.m. onwards, volunteer police in various districts continued to be dispatched to major thoroughfares to assist the People's Liberation Army in maintaining order.

### Grain Market Still Stable; Ration Rice Sold as Usual

[Reported by this Newspaper] Yesterday, the grain market was still suspended. Retail prices were still stable. Some rice shops have resumed business, and ration rice is being sold as usual. Top-quality white rice is priced at 350 to 400 million per stone, "warship flour" is 90 million per bag, and soybean oil is 11 million per catty.

### Some Students Arrested from Famous Universities Transferred to Hongkou

[Reported by this Newspaper] More than 300 students from Jiaotong, Tongji, Jinan, Fudan, and other universities who were arrested on the 26th of last month have been detained in Daren Middle School on Jianguo West Road for nearly a month. A few days ago, the Kuomintang military approved some parents to go through the procedures for bail. Yesterday morning, after the People's Liberation Army arrived in Shanghai, some of the detained students were released, but another group, it is said, was transported by truck to a certain place in Hongkou before the guarding military police withdrew. Currently, teachers and students of the respective schools and parents of the detained students are trying to find out their whereabouts.

### Provisional Joint Relief Committee Continues Relief Work; Medical and Nursing Team Officially Established

[Reported by this Newspaper] Since the liberation of Shanghai yesterday, according to Mr. Huang Zhenying, a member of the Shanghai Provisional Joint Relief Committee, the committee's relief work will continue. The defending troops in the Shanghai battle demolished many houses to construct fortifications in the suburbs, causing people to be displaced and seeking refuge in the city with the old and the young, a truly tragic sight. Therefore, the committee's relief work cannot be stopped abruptly. We still hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will support us to complete the task.

The executive committee, which meets every Wednesday and Saturday, was held as usual at 4:00 p.m. yesterday at the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge, with most members attending. Furthermore, the medical and nursing team of the committee was officially established, and presidents of major hospitals in the city were invited to serve as members.

### Strange and Great Injustice: Details of the Zhang Kun Case in Chengdu; Like a Legendary Novel

[Chengdu News] The sensational Zhang Kun case in Chengdu has recently been finalized by the Chengdu District Court. This unprecedented "great injustice" in Sichuan involves Zhang Kun, the son of the deceased Kuomintang elder Zhang Puquan, who was murdered on the evening of February 2, 1945, near the Sima Bridge in the northern suburbs of Chengdu. At the time, the Sichuan Provincial Government mobilized hundreds of detectives and, after a thorough investigation, apprehended a group of perpetrators. From the occurrence of the case to the verdict, it took a full three years and six months, involving forty to fifty people. Due to the elusive and complex nature of the case, it is generally regarded as an unprecedented injustice in Sichuan's history of over a thousand years and is also recognized as the number one strange case since the founding of the Republic of China.

Unprecedented Strange Case: Bizarre and Twisting Plot; Characters Encompassing Everything

This sensational national case involves love affairs, murder for money, and shady secrets. The characters involved include sons of important officials, politicians' wives, romantic maids, farmers, robbers, and more. The facts of the case are: Zhang Kun was the only son of Zhang Puquan. In 1944, he came to Chengdu for medical treatment for mental illness and stayed at the Municipal Mental Hospital. Coincidentally, Liu Shaoyu, a friend of the Zhang family, resided in a cemetery in the northern suburbs of Chengdu, and they became close. Later, when Liu went to Yunnan to mine, his wife, Liu Diaoshoumo, invited Zhang Kun to move to the cemetery for quiet recuperation. On the evening of February 2, 1945, Zhang went out to buy medicine. There was wind and snow all night, and the roads were muddy. Zhang did not return that night and was found murdered the next morning near the Sima Bridge, his body naked, in a truly tragic state. At the time, the Sichuan Provincial Government mobilized the Chengdu Municipal Government and the Chenghua County Government to conduct a large-scale investigation. After a month, they started the investigation from the clothing left behind by Zhang Kun before his death and apprehended suspects such as Qing Wanshun, He Zhanchun, Wu Daxing, Chen Xiaofan, Zeng Ruiping, Ren Hongxing, Ren Wangshi, and Chen Junzhi, who was accused of instigating the crime. They were interrogated successively by the Chengdu County Government and the Chengdu Municipal District Court. It took three and a half years to reach a final verdict.

The Facts of the Case: Conspiring to Murder for Money; Court Hearings Published

There are two different versions of the true circumstances of the case. One is based on the official court hearing and verdict: Zhang Yin resided in the Art Garden, while Ren Hongxing and others lived together in a thatched cottage near Sima Bridge, within sight of each other. Zhang often went out for walks, dressed impeccably, which aroused the greed of Ren and others. On the evening when Zhang went out to buy medicine, Ren, He, and Qing discovered this. They invited Wu Daxing to jointly ambush him on the road. They broke Zhang's eardrums, causing him to faint, and robbed him of all his clothing and divided it among themselves. Zhang gradually woke up, but because it was dark, he could not find his way home. Seeing the lights in Ren's thatched cottage, he went to beg for fire to warm himself. Qing Wanshun and others heard the noise and went outside, saw that Zhang had woken up, and struck him again on the head with a bamboo tube for blowing fire, and pushed him into a ditch next to the house. Zhang died from serious injuries and the extreme cold in the wheat field about ten feet away from Ren's cottage. After investigation by the detective team, Zhang Kun's clothing was found in a pile of thatch behind Ren's house. Following this clue, Ren Hongxing and his wife were arrested. After several interrogations, all relevant perpetrators were arrested. Another love affair was involved: Hu Guihong, a maid in Liu's residence, had been promised to Chen Junzhi by Liu Shaoyu. Zhang lived in Liu's residence and gradually developed a relationship with Guihong. It is said that Chen harbored deep jealousy. Because Zhang died a violent death, Chen was charged with instigating murder and imprisoned.

A Great Injustice: A Scandalous Case; Social Legends Such As This

However, another version of the facts is circulating in society. It is said that Zhang Li was inherently fond of romance. Liu Diaoshoumo was past her prime but still beautiful. The pretty maid Guihong was small and charming. Zhang's residence in the Art Garden was actually a "gentle village," where he indulged in lust and excessive dissipation, and the real cause of death was "yang depletion." After his death, someone took advantage of the situation to shift the blame. In the dark of night, Ren Hongxing was abandoned in the wheat field. Ren and other ignorant villagers stripped Zhang of his clothes (or it is said that Zhang's clothes were placed behind Ren's cottage by a servant from Liu's residence). After Ren and others were arrested, Liu's residence used 20 mu of paddy fields to buy Qing Wanshun, who testified that he conspired with Ren and others to murder Zhang Kun (Qing revealed this truth when he died in prison on October 24, 1945). Chen Junzhi was a businessman in the Rongqunce Company in Chengdu and was admired by Liu Shaoyu, who promised to marry Guihong to him, inducing him to call her a foster daughter. However, Chen later found out that Guihong was actually a maid and learned that she had an affair with Zhang. He resolutely refused to marry her. After Zhang's death, because Liu and Hu blamed Chen for refusing the marriage, they accused Chen of instigating murder. This is the true story that has been consistently identified in Chengdu's street gossip and various magazines over the years. Society in particular vividly confirmed it and was dissatisfied with the court's verdict, considering it an unprecedented great injustice. The Sichuan Provincial Assembly specially requested relevant agencies to investigate, and these "criminals" who were sentenced received widespread sympathy from the entire Sichuan society. The court also examined Guihong and found that she was still a virgin, ultimately using a "trumped-up charge."

This unprecedented strange case went from the District Court to the High Court to the Supreme Court, lasting three years and six months. The main culprit, Qing Wanshun, died in prison in the winter of 1945. Wu Daxing, Ren Hongxing, and He Zhanchun were each sentenced to ten years of imprisonment after a retrial on November 28, 1946. Chen Xiaofan and Cao Ruiping were found not guilty. Until July 27 of last year, Ren Wangshi and Chen Junzhi's cases were retried. The result was that Ren Wangshi's sentence was reduced to four years of imprisonment, and Chen Junzhi was found not guilty. This sensational national case came to a formal end.

### From City Markets to Street Stalls

[Special Feature by This Newspaper] "Shanghai Beach" - seeing the situation on the streets in the days before liberation, it should be interpreted as "Shanghai Stall," which is the most primitive form of transaction, and is also the street scene seen a few days ago. Since the People's Liberation Army entered the city yesterday morning and people's hearts have stabilized, shops, fearing the devaluation of the gold yuan notes, have generally suspended business, and street stalls have also temporarily disappeared. However, all shops, in accordance with the resolution of the Security Committee, will resume business as usual today. It is believed that the street stalls on both sides of the roads will also become lively again. Now, let us record the history of street stalls below to share with our readers:

"Trading at noon" was the trading method in ancient times, and Shanghai was certainly no exception. From Shanghai's literature, we cannot find records of market-style transactions; however, some traces of this primitive transaction have been left behind. The drama meeting during the Buddha's Birthday celebration near Jing'an Temple still has the form of a market.

The Annual Buddha's Birthday Celebration: Numerous Stalls Line the Streets Near Jing'an Temple

Jing'an Temple, among the temples in Shanghai, is also considered a famous temple, and it also has much value worth studying in history. On the eighth day of the fourth lunar month, the Buddha's Birthday celebration, Jing'an Temple usually has an annual festival, with incense burning and numerous visitors. In this lively occasion, many merchants seized the opportunity to sell goods. Near the temple, numerous stalls lined the streets, conducting transactions with pilgrims and tourists. Although they were small daily necessities, with many people and many stalls, the total number of transactions was not small! The opening and expansion of the concessions, with smooth asphalt roads extending from the Bund to Jing'an Temple, made transportation to Jing'an Temple even more convenient. Although Nanjing Road and Jing'an Temple Road have many shops, the annual Buddha's Birthday celebration has not diminished.

The Jing'an Temple fair starts from the beginning of the fourth lunar month and lasts until after the tenth, which is the market fair period. Starting from Hart Road, along Jing'an Temple Road, extending to the west of Ditihui Road. Jessfield Road and Haig Road, north to Xinzha Road, south to Avenue Foch, and Yuyuan Road and Wuzhou Road behind the temple are also places for stalls. Reed mats and cloth tents are stretched densely, covering the early summer sun. The goods sold at the stalls include woodenware, rattanware, bamboo ware, pottery, steel implements, etc., most of which are handmade products. Exquisite embroidery, brocade weaving, and fine bamboo items are also displayed. New machine-made products are also sold, such as fabrics, socks, and cosmetics, but the quality is not as good as those in the shops. In the open space, there are also magic shows, strange people and beasts, and peep shows, with flags flying and iron pots being beaten to attract customers.

Special Areas in the Concession Era: Displaying Used Goods of All Kinds

Primitive markets are all connected with temples. The Jing'an Temple fair is only once a year, but the City God Temple is surrounded by many stalls all year round. Many small shops in the temple now are the development of stalls. Fake jewelry, toys, children's shoes and hats, flowers and plants, antiques, etc., and food stalls are particularly numerous. Squid, duck blood, Nanxiang steamed buns, and glutinous rice balls in fermented rice wine are all very famous. In addition, fortune tellers are also an indispensable embellishment in temple fairs. The City God Temple is also unique in this regard. Although the City God Temple often has markets, it is even more lively during festivals. The most lively day is the half-night of New Year's Eve. Devotees rush to burn the first incense, with shoulders rubbing against each other, blocking the road. Snack stalls and incense candle shops have particularly prosperous business, and fortune telling business is also very booming. Many people want to ask about their fortunes in the coming year.

In the concession era, setting up stalls arbitrarily on the streets was not allowed, but there were still stalls. Usually, they were under the gatehouses of alleyways, and some were openly set up on the streets, which were special areas, and the goods sold were also special. The North Gate's Haichang Road and the former French Concession's Avenue Frelupt, etc., were the places where stalls were concentrated. There, clothes, hats, washbasins, pots, hardware, alarm clocks, furniture, all kinds of things were available, only they were used. Many of these things were discarded by wealthy families after they were used, and some were of unknown origin. On both sides, there were also rag shops, grocery stores, and teahouses. People on the road carried burdens, held packages, and carried boxes, all coming to the market. Because they were used goods, customers were also limited to the poor. If one has a sharp eye, one can buy cheap goods there, but if one does not know the goods, one may buy them more expensively than new ones, and sometimes one may buy slippery goods. On Rue Paul Henry, there were also many street performers participating. Fortune tellers, dentists with large umbrellas, and performers singing ballads and telling stories embellished this market even more.

Foreign Exchange Restrictions and High Prices of American Goods: The Golden Age Gradually Passes

In recent times, the street stalls in the Qiujiang Road after the victory can be promoted. People who want to find cheap goods all ran there. On the ruins burned by the war, it suddenly became a bustling market. When the victory firecrackers awakened the Japanese invaders' dreams, Japanese expatriates sold their furniture, utensils, and clothing, preparing to be sent back to their country. The furniture was very small, and it was very suitable for use in Shanghai, where land is worth a fortune. Tea sets, wine utensils, and exquisite small decorations were all very interesting. The most noticeable were the colorful ribbons on the backs of Japanese women, colorful and dazzling, and also strips of bundles.

Following Qiujiang Road, it was the American goods market. From the Pearl Harbor incident to the victory, Shanghai had not received any American goods for four years. After the victory, American goods came in abundance, and they felt particularly close, as if long-separated lovers had met again. The center of the American goods market was on Zhubaoshan Road, selling mostly surplus military supplies, as well as goods imported by formal merchants, but also backdoor goods secretly sold by American soldiers or warships. At that time, American goods were extremely cheap. Almost everyone had one or two American-style equipment, glass belts, sunglasses, Kning milk powder, and Chester cigarettes, which became the most common supplies. Although the concentration of American goods was on Zhubaoshan Road, the stalls spread throughout the city. Whether on busy or remote roads, there were traces of stalls. At this time, the prohibition of stalls along the road caused a great uproar. Later, the stallholders moved their positions and changed to setting up joint shopping malls, but their golden age had passed. Gradually, due to foreign exchange restrictions, the selling price of American goods became higher and higher, and there were no more large sales.

Eager to Cash Out: Selling on the Streets

Recently, street stalls have reappeared on the streets of Shanghai, and the situation looks very lively, but compared with the past American goods stalls, they cannot be compared. The emergence of these stalls is mostly due to the blockage of factory sales, the inflexible turnover of the economy, and the inability to pay severance fees after dissolution. Therefore, the goods were distributed to the employees, and in order to make a living, the employees took the goods and sold them on the streets to cash them out quickly. Many shops, which originally had very little business, also took advantage of this opportunity to distribute some goods and asked their employees to set up stalls. The stalls mostly sell light industrial products, such as towels, sheets, clothing materials, pots, and thermos bottles. The prices are also very cheap, but the transactions are very quiet. Although there are many people around the stalls, there are few real buyers. The appearance of these many stalls also indicates the withering of industry and commerce.

### Under the New Democratic Economic System, Private Banks Still Have a Way Out: Assisting National Banks in Developing Production

[Reported by This Newspaper] Do private banks have a way out in the society under the New Democratic economic system? A reporter interviewed several bankers who have a better understanding of the New Democratic economy. According to the discussion: "In the new economic system, private banks have a way out. This way is not to help speculative merchants, raise prices, and exploit the people, but to help production, enrich social wealth, and let everyone have food and clothing. This road is healthy and easy to walk because there are national banks leading the way. The business of national banks is to help state-owned or larger enterprises. Private banks have less power, so they can help small-scale or even handicraft producers. In other words, private banks can assist national banks in supporting production organizations and producers that national banks do not have time to take care of. Based on this principle, private banks should always check whether the loans of their customers are really used for production and must thoroughly prevent them from going the way of commercial speculation. At first, there may be difficulties in attracting deposits, but after helping producers increase production, a normal and close relationship can definitely be established, developing production and prospering the economy, and the bad effects of the past will no longer occur."
