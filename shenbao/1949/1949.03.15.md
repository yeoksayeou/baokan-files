### Preliminary Negotiations in Shanghai Concluded; President He Scheduled to Go to the Capital This Morning; Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, and Zhang Junmai All Decline Cabinet Positions; Youth Party Agrees in Principle to Participate

[Report from our newspaper] President He Yingqin's preliminary cabinet formation work in Shanghai has come to an end. The Youth Party, in principle, does not oppose participating in the new cabinet, but still needs to make a decision at an internal party meeting; Zhang Junmai has declined to participate, stating that the People's Socialist Party will support the new cabinet in the capacity of an opposition party. In addition, Zhang Shizhao is still considering, while Yan Huiqing and Jiang Yong have both expressed their unwillingness to participate due to old age and health reasons. President He concluded his public duties in Shanghai and was originally scheduled to take the 11 o'clock express train to the capital last night. The railway bureau had prepared a special car, but he temporarily decided to postpone it and will depart at 7:00 this morning. After arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, He personally visited Zhang Junmai at 7:00 p.m. that evening, inviting him to participate in the new cabinet. Zhang politely declined, saying that the People's Socialist Party was willing to assist the new cabinet as an opposition party. At 9:00 p.m., he went to Zuo's residence on Difeng Road to consult with the leaders of the Youth Party. Li Huang, Zuo Shunsheng, Xie Chengping, and Lin Keji were all present. The consultation lasted for more than an hour before he left. Yesterday morning, Yan Huiqing and Chen Guangfu visited one after another, and did not leave until 11:00 a.m. President He then drove to visit Jiang Yong and Zhang Shizhao, earnestly inviting them to participate in the new cabinet. At that time, Jiang Yong stated that his purpose in going to Beiping was to strive for peace for all the people. If he were to participate in the government now, it would invite criticism and cause many inconveniences, which he hoped He would understand. Zhang Shizhao is still considering. Around 1:00 p.m. in the afternoon, Mayor Wu and Duanmu Kai and others visited one after another, but President He was out and had not returned, so they did not meet. Around 2:00 p.m., Finance Minister Xu Kan was summoned to visit and had a long talk for several hours. According to President He's public statement: in addition to the peace talks, the most difficult problem for the new cabinet is the economic and financial situation.

[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 14th] The new Premier He Yingqin will arrive in Beijing from Shanghai by special train at 12:00 noon on the 15th. Political figures in the capital and members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans who are currently meeting are eagerly awaiting He's arrival in Beijing, and especially hope that he can form a new cabinet quickly with an innovative style. It is learned that He's list of candidates for the new cabinet has been largely finalized after inviting and consulting with people from all walks of life in Shanghai, and only needs to be decided after returning to the capital and consulting with Acting President Li.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] More than 100 legislators held a forum on the 14th to exchange opinions freely. Some people suggested that the new premier should be notified to submit a list of cabinet members as soon as possible. The current situation is serious and cannot be delayed. It would be best to ask President He to submit a policy report at the Friday meeting of the five Yuans next week.

### Proposal to Simplify Administrative Agencies; Legislative Yuan to Discuss Today; Proposal to Suspend Application of the Suppression of Rebellion Act Also on the Agenda; Peace Proposal to Be Re-Voted

[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 14th] The proposal to simplify administrative agencies and amend the Organic Law of the Executive Yuan, which has been passed by the review committee of the Legislative Yuan, has been included in the agenda of the fifth plenary meeting of the third session on the 15th. If this proposal is passed soon, it may affect the upcoming He Yingqin's new cabinet. However, given the enthusiastic discussions during the previous plenary meeting and the review committee, submitting it to the plenary meeting may still lead to fierce debate. In addition, the items for discussion on the agenda of the Yuan meeting on the 15th also include the re-voting on the peace proposal, the proposal to abolish the regulations on special criminal courts, the proposal to suspend the application of the Temporary Provisions for the Period of Suppression of Rebellion, the proposal to adjust the salaries of public educators, and the proposal to launch gold-priced deposits.

### President Chiang Still in Xikou

[Report from our newspaper in Ningbo on the 14th] Foreign news reports that President Chiang has left his hometown of Xikou and moved to Gulangyu, Xiamen, have now been proven to be completely untrue. The President once came to Ningbo for sightseeing, and the rumors may have originated from this.

### Legislators Propose to Launch "Gold-Priced Deposits"

[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 14th] Legislators Huang Tong and 35 others proposed to launch gold-priced deposits to stabilize finance, improve salary payment methods, protect savings, and unite the hearts of the military and civilians. They listed the following five measures: (1) Launch "gold-priced deposits," ordering people to deposit gold yuan into national banks, convert them into cash at the price of gold and silver at the time of deposit (the listed price must be consistent with the market price), allow them to withdraw them regularly or at any time, pay them in gold yuan converted at the listed price of gold and silver at the time of withdrawal, and pay interest accordingly. If there is a need to withdraw cash, cash will still be paid. Deposits will not be refused for small amounts or small depositors. (2) The salaries and incomes of public educators and soldiers will be based on the pre-war salary and rank, in addition to paying sufficient gold yuan according to the current cost of living index, and allocating some cash, the remainder will be listed and recorded as long-term deposits with preferential interest. If there are weddings, funerals, or other important needs, temporary withdrawals will be allowed. (3) Military personnel will be handled in the same way as public educators, but for lower-ranking soldiers, a separate method of transferring and storing funds for their family members in their native place will be established. In addition to giving them the amount sufficient for current living expenses, the remainder will be transferred monthly to their direct relatives in their native place or the person they entrust to store and withdraw, or they can withdraw it themselves after retirement. This deposit will be handled properly by the county government in their native place according to the troop transfer documents in the conscription register. (4) For ordinary farmers, businessmen, people, and industrialists, policies such as using checks, treasury bills, and public bonds to regulate finance, absorb currency, develop production, and increase tax revenue, and use "gold-priced deposits" as the basis for consolidating credit and stabilizing the economy. (5) The government will allocate sufficient gold and silver and materials to establish a deposit fund management committee under the full supervision of the people, and use diplomacy to obtain economic loans to strengthen credit.

### Joint Symposium to Be Held by Legislative and Supervisory Yuan Members

[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 14th] Members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans meeting in Beijing will hold a joint symposium on the 20th. It was decided on the 14th by the Legislative Yuan's symposium to contact the members of the Supervisory Yuan and make preparations. The deliberation of the joint meeting of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members has been going on for a long time. It is generally believed that the current situation is serious and there are many problems to be resolved. It is necessary for the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans to be connected and exert their strength.

### Acting President Li Orders Taiwan Provincial Government; Military Orders Shall All Be Under Chen Cheng's Command

[Report from our newspaper in Taipei on the 14th] The Presidential Office recently ordered the Taiwan Provincial Government that, from today onwards, all central military organs and troops in Taiwan shall be under the unified command of Chairman and Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng.

### Railway, Postal, and Telecommunications Charges Collected at New Prices; Legislators Express Outrage; More Than 100 Propose Effective Prohibition

[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 14th] Railways, postal services, and telecommunications increased their prices again on the 11th. On the same day, the Legislative Yuan resolved to ask the Executive Yuan to prohibit it and not recognize the new prices. However, although the case was resolved and notified to the Executive Yuan, postal bureaus, telecommunications bureaus, and railway bureaus have not received orders for days and still charge at the new prices. Most legislators expressed extreme indignation at this, believing that the Executive Yuan's failure to implement the Legislative Yuan's resolutions has damaged the Legislative Yuan's credibility. More than 100 members, including Niu Jianchu, decided to submit an urgent motion, "The Executive Yuan has not yet implemented the prohibition of price increases in the transportation industry, and it is proposed to take effective measures," which will be discussed at the Yuan meeting on the morning of the 15th. The reasons stated in the motion point out that the Executive Yuan has not yet implemented the prohibition of price increases, and the recent soaring prices are caused by its stimulus. Effective measures should be discussed again to maintain the credibility of the Yuan and alleviate the burden on the people. The original motion included two measures: (1) Immediately notify the Minister of Communications by telephone to come to the Yuan to report the reasons why Zhu has not implemented the Yuan's resolution to prohibit price increases. (2) Consult the Executive Yuan again to immediately revoke the newly announced train, postal, and telecommunications prices in the transportation sector. When the Legislative Yuan's plenary symposium was held on the afternoon of the 14th, Zhang Qingzhen also raised this matter orally. The emotions of the members were extremely excited, advocating for severe questioning. However, since the Minister and Deputy Minister of Transportation are currently not in Beijing, it was decided to ask Secretary-General Chen Kewen to telegraph the Minister or Deputy Minister of Transportation in the name of the Legislative Yuan to fly to Beijing immediately to attend the Yuan meeting on the 18th to explain the reasons and be prepared for questioning.

### Communist Troops Retreat from Luoshan; Flee Back to the North Bank of the Huai River; Communist Intelligence Agents Cross the River South to Conduct Activities

[Report from our newspaper in Xinyang on the 14th] Military news: (1) There were still minor contacts in the counties of Luoshan and Zhengyang this morning. A group of communist troops that retreated from Bali Store in northeastern Luoshan has fled back to the north bank of the Huai River. A group of more than 800 people is still wandering in Wanjiagang, 15 li from the county. (2) More than 2,000 communist troops continued to arrive in Runan on the 12th, heading south along the eastern side of the Pinghan Railway. More than 10,000 communist troops who had crossed the Zi River and advanced south were still stationed in Chendian, 25 li south of Huangchuan yesterday. The movements of this unit will be clear in the coming days.

[Report from our newspaper in Zhenjiang on the 14th] The Communist troops in northern Jiangsu recently dispatched intelligence personnel to cross the Yangtze River south to carry out all underground activities.

### Legislative Yuan Subcommittee Drafts Outline for Political Reform

[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 14th] The drafting committee of the Legislative Yuan's outline for political reform held its fourth meeting at 9:30 a.m. on the 14th. Chairman Zou Shuwen and the committee members continued to speak on the issue of political reform. Finally, it was decided that Zou Shuwen and eight others who were previously appointed would organize their opinions, and Yuan Qixun would be the chief drafter to draft the outline for political reform and submit it to the next Yuan meeting for discussion.

Fang further demanded that the customs regulations on the Sino-Soviet border must be completely suspended in the future. If our side agrees to this request, the Soviet side can avoid our customs inspection and transport various non-standard goods into Xinjiang. In the mining sector, the Soviet side proposed that China and the Soviet Union jointly form a mining company, each contributing half of the capital, to exploit "precious and non-ferrous metals" in Xinjiang, and not allow other countries to intervene. Our side does not oppose the joint development of Xinjiang's resources by China and the Soviet Union, but insists on its own position, demanding that the names and types of metals to be mined be detailed in the agreement. The Soviet side firmly refused this, and negotiations stalled. According to geologists' research, there may be uranium mines in Xinjiang, so our side will not make concessions in order to maintain national sovereignty. At the same time, in the Soviet draft agreement, it was requested that the agreement be valid for 50 years and stipulated that mineral products that cannot be used in Xinjiang itself can be exported to the Soviet Union. If our side agrees to this clause, once uranium mines are discovered, they can be sold to the Soviet Union because they cannot be used in Xinjiang. Our side, on the other hand, proposed that the agreement be valid for a maximum of five to fifteen years.

### US State Department Drafting Report on Aid to China

[United Press, Washington, 13th] Democratic Senator George announced today that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has requested Secretary of State Acheson to submit a report stating his views on the new bill for $1.5 billion in military and economic aid to China proposed by Senator McMillan and 54 others. The State Department is currently drafting the report, which may explain the future US policy towards China.

### Sino-Soviet Negotiations Stalled; Soviet Side Seeking Uranium Mines Needed for Atomic Energy; Our Side Refuses to Concede in Order to Maintain National Sovereignty

[Report from our newspaper] According to authoritative sources, the Sino-Soviet trade negotiations that began in January of this year have now stalled. According to the content of this agreement, the Soviet Union would be allowed various privileges in Xinjiang, including commercial aviation and mining, and would have the opportunity to explore uranium mines needed to manufacture atomic energy. Moscow made this request as early as two years ago when Wang Zhaojie presided over diplomacy. At that time, our country did not consider it, and the Soviet side, seeing that the environment was not yet ripe, did not continue to make requests. Recently, the situation has changed drastically, and the pro-Soviet atmosphere within the government has become stronger. The Soviet side revived the old matter, which shows the Soviet Union's diplomatic mobility and pragmatism. The deadlock in the Sino-Soviet trade negotiations is due to two reasons: in terms of trade, the Soviet side requested that, in addition to the official barter trade, it be allowed to trade with private individuals and private companies in Xinjiang. Our side can still consider this point, but the Soviet

[Report from our newspaper in Hangzhou on the 14th] General Liu Zhi left for Shanghai by car at 8:00 a.m. on the 14th to return to Beijing.

### Beiping Type (III)

— Jiang Xue

(Reports on a city before and after "Local Peace")

(II) Communist Troops Enter Beiping City

After the main points of the Beiping local peace plan were announced, the troops stationed in the city immediately began to move out of the city. The first batch of troops leaving the city came into contact with the communist troops at any time because the communist troops did not withdraw 30 li in accordance with the agreement. Moreover, a small number of communist troops were "shouting" to the soldiers leaving the city, calling on them to join the People's Liberation Army. This aroused the anger of the troop leaders and soldiers, and they fought each other. After two full hours of fighting, the misunderstanding was resolved after the superiors explained that the communist troops would no longer "shout" and restrained each other, and other troops left the city one after another.

In addition to the military organs of the North China Suppression Headquarters, which were agreed to be handled by Fu Zuoyi himself, the transfer of hundreds of thousands of troops, including the headquarters of the 49th and 2nd Corps, eight armies, and 25 divisions, and the removal of weapons, ammunition, food, clothing, etc. in the warehouses, could not be completed in the originally estimated three days. Many practical technical issues required a lot of twists and turns and consideration. Moreover, the communist side also needed time to prepare for the takeover after entering the city. Therefore, it was not until February 1 that a part of the communist troops entered the city and announced the establishment of a joint office. In this week or so, the old were busy ending and the new had not yet entered the city, which almost became a vacuum. Many military and political personnel of greater importance took the opportunity to fly south at high prices. There were many scattered soldiers and bandits on the market, and three or five robbery cases occurred every day. There were especially many rumors. Some said that a certain troop did not accept the local peace plan, was unwilling to leave the city, and wanted to fight. The rumbling sound of digging up landmines in the city and detonating them automatically also added a lot of stimulation and tension! In short, there were more rumors than facts. The people went from guessing to suspicion, and from suspicion, there were many rumors. During this period, it was indeed hoped that the communist troops could enter the city as soon as possible to dispel many doubts.

A part of the political workers of the communist army had already entered the city and lived in the Beijing Hotel and Lizhi Society (formerly Cuimingzhuang) to discuss the takeover methods and procedures and prepare for all takeover work at any time. However, the entry of the communist troops into the city was on February 1. On that day, a part of the armed forces entered the city and held a simple parade. This entry parade was led by a broadcasting vehicle sent by the North China Suppression Headquarters, which broadcast to the citizens along the street at any time, saying: "Now the People's Liberation Army is entering the city, let us all applaud and welcome them!" So the citizens along the way applauded to show their welcome. The second and third cars were carrying a small number of armed communist troops and staff of the Military Control Commission, male and female political workers. The fourth car was an armed patrol car sent by the Garrison Headquarters to protect them at any time and avoid accidents. This parade passed through the major streets of the four cities of Beiping, east, south, west, and north, with the purpose of giving citizens the impression that the communist troops had come to the city.

The entry of the communist troops into the city was certainly not so simple. The schools and people's organizations instigated by the Communist Party certainly wanted to give a warm welcome and celebrate the "liberation" of Beiping. The communist troops also wanted to take this opportunity to hold a demonstrative parade to publicize how many weapons they had seized from the Kuomintang troops and how powerful their Liberation Army was! Therefore, February 3 was the day when the communist troops entered Beiping City and held the entry parade.

The weather in Beiping this year was very warm, and there was very little sandstorm. On February 3, suddenly the yellow sand covered the sky and the wind raged, which was very unfortunate! But the sandstorm could not stop their entry parade. From 8:00 a.m., Wangfujing Street and Dong'anmen Street in the eastern city were already crowded with neat lines, two rows of four people in a row, flowing south towards Tiananmen; the western city was centered on Fu Jen Catholic University, heading towards the area of Xisi Pailou North Street. Because the entry route of the communist troops was Yongdingmen on Qianmen Street as the first entrance and Xizhimen as the second entrance, the welcoming crowds also cooperated with these two routes.

Most of the welcoming crowds were students. Students from universities, middle schools, and primary schools were all mobilized today, beating gongs and drums, dressing up in various strange-looking roles, dancing the yangko dance, and singing various liberation songs composed by the Communist Party. Among these welcoming crowds, in addition to a small number of their cadres who became the center of instigation, there were also some opportunists who hoped to take this opportunity to show off and perform achievements in order to ingratiate themselves with the Communist Party. The antics of these people were even more enthusiastic, tense, and energetic than the Communist Party cadres themselves! Most of the crowds were watching the fun and had a nonchalant mood, which can be fully demonstrated from their actions and expressions. The news dispatches sent by AP reporter Musa and UPI reporter Gian said that the people of Beiping welcomed the People's Liberation Army with the mood of welcoming conquerors in the past. If one stands on an objective position, or is not a defender of the Communist Party, one cannot deny the correctness of their reports. This statement is indeed closer to the facts!

The troops entering Beiping City included infantry, cavalry, artillery, and mechanized units. The great lines, neat steps, were of course very majestic and imposing! Especially the American-style equipment seized from the Northeast, many electrical weapons such as heavy artillery, mortars, various cannons and mountain cannons, as well as battle tanks, tank cars, etc., looked really martial and amazing to the eyes of the Beiping people who had never experienced artillery fire! Many young students added flowers to the brocade and exaggerated the scene, which need not be described in detail here. The entry parade of the communist troops was so enthusiastic and tense, and it took place in a whirlwind of sand, followed by the start of the work of taking over Beiping. (Continued on page two)

### Supervisory Yuan Impeaches Sun Ke; Lanni's Paint Case Causes a Storm

[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 14th] The Supervisory Yuan's impeachment case against former Premier Sun Ke, after being investigated and reported by Supervisory Committee members Xiong Zaiwei and Jin Yueguang, has been declared established and the documents have been sent out. This is one of the most significant cases in the Supervisory Yuan's impeachment cases in recent years. It is said that the case was approved three days ago, but since Sun resigned from the Executive Yuan out of fear of his duties, it was officially announced on the 14th. The impeachment documents specify that Sun handled the case of 84 barrels of paint belonging to his concubine Lanni (i.e., Lan Yezhen) during his tenure as Premier of the Executive Yuan, which was obviously using his power for personal gain and dishonoring official ethics, and should be severely punished. Xiong and Jin, the two Supervisory Committee members, pointed out in their investigation report: "Our country's politics are corrupt and have reached the extreme today... To restore the people's hearts and salvage the critical situation, the minimum requirement is to establish a clean government. Sun Ke, as the highest administrative head of a country, was ordered to take office in times of difficulty... but he coveted private gain, violated the law, and dereliction of duty. If he is not severely punished, how can we appease public anger and encourage morale..." It is reported that this case was caused by Sun's request to return the paint for his concubine Lanni during his tenure as President of the Legislative and Executive Yuan. The full text of the impeachment is more than 5,000 words, which details the entire business process and Sun Ke's use of his power. It is said that on January 7, 1946, the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau seized 84 barrels of paint in the Tianhougong Bridge warehouse. At first, the so-called owner could not prove his ownership. Unexpectedly, after the auction in July of the same year, on October 1, it suddenly received a letter from Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, with his own signature, addressed to Liu Gongyun, stating that the paint was "stored in Shanghai by my family," explaining that "it is not enemy property," and "cannot be confiscated simply because its origin is unknown," requesting its prompt return. Then, in May 1947, Lan Yezhen (i.e., Lanni) submitted a petition to the Central Trust Bureau's Enemy Property Clearing Office in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui districts, stating that the paint was entrusted by her to the Jin Kang Bank, but she was arrested for suspicion of being a traitor after the victory, and the police sealed it up. She was released in January 1946, and a dispute arose between the batch of materials and the person, requesting an investigation and prompt return. Later, Director Wu Ren-cang also received letters from Hong Lanyou and Lou Tongsun pleading for Lan's case, explaining that the paint belonged to Sun Zhesheng's concubine Lan Yezhen, and requesting that it be processed in advance. Later, the office forwarded it to the Executive Yuan, which approved that the confiscated paint should be supplemented because there was still no strong evidence to support it. Later, Lanni submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan one after another, requesting its direct return. The General Executive Yuan sent it to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee for further investigation, and immediately summoned all relevant personnel to reply to the Executive Yuan. Until recently, when Sun Ke was the Premier of the Executive Yuan, the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee suddenly received instructions from the Executive Yuan on January 17, approving the return of the property. If it cannot be paid with items of the same type and quality, it should be paid according to the current value. The committee then decided to hand it over to the German Property Clearing Office to estimate the price of the dyes before returning them. The German Property Office stated that the types and quantities of the dyes returned in this case were hundreds of times the types and quantities claimed by the petitioner and the customs records. How to calculate and return them according to which dyes and quantities was still under review by the meeting. Xiong and Jin, the two Supervisory Committee members, believed that the witnesses presented by Lan Yezhen could not be considered to have sufficient reasons, and Sun Ke did not avoid suspicion, spoke for his concubine, and entrusted senior government officials to intercede on his behalf, which was obviously dishonoring official ethics. Later, he even instructed the Executive Yuan to return the goods at the current value, which was even more of using his power to benefit his concubine. Therefore, he specifically based the impeachment on the facts of the case.

### Zhang Zhaoyuan Issues Statement: Declares This Case Is Purely Legal Handling

[Central News Agency, This City] Zhang Zhaoyuan, Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Committee for the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Industries, recently issued a statement on the Lan [surname] pigment case as follows: "Regarding this case of eighty-four barrels of pigment, the Enemy and Puppet Industry Clearance Office previously seized them based on a secret report. The pigment owner, Lan [surname], repeatedly submitted property documents requesting their return. This was delayed for several years, remaining unresolved. The Executive Yuan, considering this case a legal matter, instructed the Ministry of Justice to research and provide its opinion, which stated: Since Lan [surname] has not been convicted of treason by a court, his property cannot be regarded as property of a traitor. Since Lan [surname] is the holder of the warehouse receipt for these pigments, he should be recognized as the owner of this property. If the government wants to confiscate it, it should bear the burden of proof and cannot simply confiscate it based on a secret report. Executive Yuan Counselors E Sen and Guan Ou both held the same view and signed a request to return the pigments. This was the situation before President Sun took over the Executive Yuan, as can be verified by the records. In early January of the current year, the Executive Yuan's Committee for the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Industries was clearing backlog cases and presented this case, along with more than thirty other pending cases, for discussion at a meeting. By an overwhelming majority vote, it was resolved that the pigments should be returned, as can also be verified by the meeting minutes. The Executive Yuan's Committee for the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Industries, as usual, forwarded the resolution to the Executive Yuan Secretariat, which ordered the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Industry Review Committee to review it. The review resulted in a notification to the Central Trust Bureau's Enemy and Puppet Industry Clearance Office to complete valuation procedures in preparation for returning the pigments at their appraised value. This was because the pigments had already been sold, yielding over 20 million Legal Tender dollars, which were turned over to the national treasury. However, the competent authorities, in view of the Control Yuan's investigation into the case, have already notified the Central Trust Bureau's Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Industry Clearance Office to suspend progress and await the investigation. Therefore, not a single cent has been returned to date. Based on current market prices, the total value of the pigments is less than US$5,000. The administrative authorities are purely handling this case according to law, and it has absolutely no connection to President Sun personally. Many similar cases have also been resolved by the Executive Yuan's Committee for the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Industries with the decision to return the property, and there has been no discrepancy in treatment."

### Editorial: A Truly Responsible Cabinet

—Second Expectation of Premier He—

General He Yingqin spent all day yesterday in Shanghai, discussing the formation of a cabinet with various parties, especially focusing on how the new cabinet will resolve the current economic crisis. With the overall situation so urgent, both the government and the public hope that General He will go to Nanjing as soon as possible to organize the new cabinet. Judging by the trend, this cabinet reshuffle will not be delayed for as long as three weeks, as it was during the handover between the previous two administrations of Weng and Sun.

Let us put aside the political, economic, and military policies that should be adopted now, and first raise a fundamental question of political system: Can General He form a truly responsible cabinet?

The biggest problem in China's politics in recent years, which has prevented progress and kept it from getting on track, is that it has never established a political system suitable for modern trends. However, this new system is something that China, in a period of transformation, must quickly establish. Extremely centralized states rely on rule by people; democratic states rely on rule by law. Rule by people may have the advantage of being quick to make decisions and highly efficient. However, the concentration of power also leads to particularly large abuses of dictatorship and autocracy. Rule by law may feel slow in some areas, with many checks and balances, inevitably reducing efficiency. However, with clear division of powers and orderly operation, politics is easier to get on track. China now claims to be implementing constitutionalism, and the Constitution of the Republic of China clearly stipulates that the Executive Yuan is a responsible cabinet. Therefore, the first step in curing China's political ills today should be to address this fundamental problem. Unfortunately, in the past, many people only paid attention to personnel matters and vying for positions. Few were able to put aside complex personal relationships and feudal status concepts, and work together to establish a truly responsible cabinet system. General He's cabinet formation should no longer treat this system casually.

According to Article 57 of the Constitution, the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan. Being responsible means being responsible for implementing policies endorsed by the Legislative Yuan. In other words, the Executive Yuan is only responsible to the Legislative Yuan when implementing its policies and legislative bills passed by the Legislative Yuan, and has no other so-called responsibility. In order to fulfill this responsibility, the Premier of the Executive Yuan has his own standards for selecting cabinet members and should not be interfered with or constrained by any party. Article 56 of the Constitution clearly stipulates: "The Vice-Premier of the Executive Yuan, the heads of the various ministries and commissions, and the ministers without portfolio shall be nominated by the Premier of the Executive Yuan and appointed by the President." From this, it can be seen that in the formation of a responsible cabinet, not only should the Legislative Yuan or legislators not interfere in advance with the candidates sought by the Premier of the Executive Yuan, but the President should also not have any say in the matter, because the Chinese Constitution does not adopt the presidential system of the United States.

Now that General He has been nominated by Acting President Li and approved by a majority vote in the Legislative Yuan to serve as Premier of the Executive Yuan, we believe that as all parties demand the establishment of a responsible cabinet system, Acting President Li and the legislators will trust General He and allow him complete freedom to seek cabinet members before he takes office. We hope that this is the beginning of the implementation of a good political system. Therefore, we especially urge Premier He to value his position, duties, and responsibilities. Although he can be impartial and recruit talent, he should never, in legal terms, act like the previous premiers, who constantly "sought instructions" on the left and "obeyed edicts" on the right. Not only should he recruit cabinet members by attracting talent in personnel matters, but also in administrative matters, as long as a policy is endorsed by the Legislative Yuan, he should be responsible for carrying it out and should not and cannot shirk his responsibilities under "instructions" or "edicts."

So, what are the real problems facing Premier He today? In summary, they are nothing more than personnel and administration, namely: (1) How to find cabinet members? (2) What policies to decide? Regarding policies, of course, the main theme is to seek the realization of peace, which we will discuss later. Here, we will first discuss how to find cabinet members. We would like to offer two principles for Premier He's reference:

First, seek talent. Today, people are extremely annoyed when they hear the terms "party," "faction," etc. The reason why national affairs have become so bad is that the concepts of party or faction are secretly at work! Those who join a party are favored, and those who oppose it are attacked. This has become the fashion in recent years. The idea of "a new dynasty, a new set of officials" still faintly exists. To the extreme, classmates, associations, clubs, fellow provincials and countrymen, and even... nepotism can all become the basis for spoils distribution. As a result, governance does not ask about policies, and work does not emphasize efficiency. As long as one has connections, everyone can be promoted. The atmosphere in officialdom is getting worse and worse. Real talent is either in seclusion or in decline. Who else can stand out? Moreover, in this difficult situation, it is already difficult to find real talent even when treating scholars with courtesy. If one seeks talent from the group who come to seek positions, it is already second-rate. We know that Premier He has not even had a private secretary since resigning as Minister of National Defense. This demeanor is already very rare. Today, as he is ordered to form a cabinet, he should broaden his horizons, open his mind, be absolutely impartial, and humbly seek talent. When recruiting someone to join the cabinet, he should only ask whether he is truly talented, and not care about which party, faction, group, school, association, or province he belongs to. Especially, he should not be misled by divisive terms such as "progressive," "backward," "enlightened," "stubborn," "democratic," "reactionary," etc., and cause talented people to be left in obscurity and sycophants to be promoted to high positions.

Second, take responsibility. In times of hardship, when seeking talent to assist in governance, it is necessary not only to have learning and talent but also to be willing to take responsibility. It is often seen that many talented people, after spending many years in officialdom, become infected with the bureaucratic habits of saying "yes" to everything and shirking responsibility. These people may not be without talent, but they may not be able to shoulder great responsibilities because they lack the ability to take responsibility. What is valued in a responsible cabinet is that not only must the Premier bear overall responsibility, but the cabinet members must also each bear responsibility to the Premier for implementing policies within their respective areas of expertise. If most of the people sought by the Premier are "rubber-stamp" officials who ask for instructions on everything and submit every matter for review, then they are too far from the word "responsibility." Without cabinet members who can truly take responsibility, how can a truly responsible cabinet be formed by relying on one Premier alone?

When we read history, we always see that the rise and fall of dynasties are inseparable from the advancement and retreat of talent. When gentlemen decline, villains rise; when villains decline, gentlemen rise. Although this is said to be the trend of the times, the ability to reverse the situation lies in the vision of those in high positions. Talent, talent, when and where is it not available? It depends on whether those in power can recognize it, use it, and use it properly. Premier He should not fail to live up to the expectations of the people!

### Commander of the 17th Pacification Zone, Li Mo'an, Decides to Resign, Believing that the Xiangxi Incident Was Caused by Remnant Feudal Forces

[This Newspaper, Changsha, 14th] Li Mo'an, Commander of the 17th Pacification Zone, has decided to resign and requests the abolition of the 17th Pacification Zone. Li's view on the Xiangxi incident is as follows: (1) The so-called "popular uprising" is in name only; the real purpose is to obstruct political reform and protect the vested interests of remnant feudal forces. (2) It is the death struggle of a counter-revolutionary group. (3) It is a possible disturbance encountered in the process of implementing revolutionary strategy. (4) The oppressors claim to be the oppressed; "anti-oppression" is a great irony of their own essence. (5) The counter-revolutionary disturbance in Xiangxi is anti-era and anti-progressive; all its ideas and actions will set history back fifty years.

[This Newspaper, Changsha, 14th] Wugang also has "unclear situation" rumors. Bandits from Chenxi are moving east. Zhang Dazhi occupied Shaojiwan, at the junction of Yuanling and Luxi, and Yang Guangyao occupied Sanjiaoping. Their intentions are unknown.

[This Newspaper, Changsha, 14th] The fall of Xupu has been rumored here repeatedly. According to reliable information, the bandits harassing Xupu consist of two groups: one is Shi Meihou, from Zhang Yulin's troops based in Chenxi, who sneaked into Dajiangkou, in Xupu County; the other is Xiang Chengzhu, a self-proclaimed commander of a certain division of the 14th Column from Longtan. It is still impossible to ascertain which group is approaching the city of Xupu. Deng Feihuang, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, told reporters: The Magistrate of Xupu County did send an urgent telegram on the 10th, but it is not yet confirmed whether the city has fallen. Li Dongsheng's bandits fled from Southern Chenxi and have been confirmed to have captured Huaihua. County Magistrate Zhang Zhifan was taken hostage in Yushuwan.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 14th] The Haiwen, a Chinese ship chartered by the International Refugee Organization, encountered danger due to heavy fog a few miles south of here on the 13th and was towed here by a tugboat this morning.

### Gold Confiscated for Being Smuggled into Hong Kong Amounted to Over 7,000 Taels Last Year, Estimated Number of Those Who Evaded the Law Must Be Very Large

[This Newspaper] As Hong Kong is one of the sterling bloc countries and the United Kingdom is a signatory to the International Monetary Fund agreement, Hong Kong also has an obligation to comply with the signed treaty and prohibits the import of gold.

### Headquarters of the China Democratic League Moves to Beiping, Temporary Working Committee Established First, Shen Junru and Zhang Bojun Elected to Preside

[This Newspaper] According to a broadcast from a Chinese Communist Party radio station in Beiping on the 13th, the headquarters of the China Democratic League established a temporary working committee in Beiping on the 5th of this month to lead domestic and foreign affairs. The headquarters of the China Democratic League, originally located in Hong Kong, concluded its work on the same day. According to the person in charge of the League's secretariat, since the China Democratic League was declared illegal by the Kuomintang government in October 1947, in addition to the local organizations going underground to continue fighting, the headquarters was moved to Hong Kong to work. Recently, as the heads of the headquarters successively arrived in the "Liberated Areas," in order to adapt to the new situation and strengthen the leadership of domestic and foreign League affairs, it was decided to move the headquarters from Hong Kong to Beiping. Before the relocation work of the headquarters is completed, a temporary working committee of the headquarters will be established in Beiping to prepare for the convening of the Fourth Central Plenary Session of the China Democratic League and to represent the League externally.

### The Beiping Type

[Continued from the First Page] On February 12th, which was the fifteenth day of the first month of the lunar calendar, various people's organizations and students in Beiping City held a grand celebration to celebrate the liberation of Beiping. From 7:00 in the morning, people were gathering in every corner of the city and setting off separately. The celebration was originally scheduled to start at 10:00 in the morning, but Tiananmen Square was already packed before 9:00. The east-west range was marked by the Three Arched Gates, and the south extended even further. Before the meeting started, gongs and drums resounded to the sky, and the performing troupes of various organizations twisted and turned in Yangge dances, vying to be the most unique and competitive. Among them, the performing troupe of North China People's University was particularly outstanding, as they were specially trained. Their Yangge dance was exceptionally standard and authentic, and many people who wanted to learn the Yangge dance were enthusiastically and attentively observing their movements. Every time the Chinese Communist Party arrives in a place, the first thing that influences the local people is the widespread transmission and practice of liberation songs and the Yangge dance. "The East is Red, the sun rises, China has produced a Mao Zedong, he is the great savior of the Chinese people, he is the great savior of the Chinese people..." is a song that even three-year-old children can hum. The Yangge dance was originally a folk art practiced by the people of rural North China and Northeast China during the first month of the lunar calendar. The steps are simple, and it can be performed anywhere as long as it is accompanied by gongs and drums. Now, it has become a representative work of the Chinese Communist Party. After Beiping achieved partial peace, liberation songs and Yangge dances could be heard and seen everywhere.

Ye Jianying explained the significance of the liberation of Beiping and the tasks of military control at the celebration. He said that in order to accomplish the tasks of military control, it was also necessary to arrest war criminals and leading figures of the reactionaries who must be arrested. This gave the people a concrete impression that the increasingly tight situation in Beiping was an inevitable phenomenon.

(3) Their Flag is a Sickle, Axe and a Star

In general propaganda, Beiping is presented as having achieved "partial peace." The official statement from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party specifically pointed out the exemplary role of the partial peace in Beiping. Their intention is to hope that military and political leaders across the country will follow the example of General Fu Zuoyi and use the partial peace in Beiping as a model. The partial peace in Beiping has invisibly become a type, a "Beiping-type" of peace! Personnel from the Communist Party's urban work department are also spreading the word within the city that after the realization of partial peace in Beiping, a coalition government will be established, which is different from the liberation of Shenyang, Changchun, and Tianjin. The takeover work in Beiping will also be handled by a joint organization, with four members from the Communist Party and three from Fu Zuoyi's side. The four members from the Communist Party are Ye Jianying, Xu Bing, Tao Zhu, and Rong Zihe; the three from Fu Zuoyi's side are Guo Zongfen, Zhou Beifeng, and Jiao Shizhai. These seven people will form a committee, with Ye Jianying as the chairman and Guo Zongfen as the vice-chairman, jointly responsible for handling the handover work. On the surface, this is also a form of union. However, the large-character slogans written by the Communist army on the city walls of Beiping's outer city say, "Fu Zuoyi Leads His Troops to Surrender." What exactly is being sold in this gourd? What kind of situation will it ultimately be? The people living in the city of Beiping are witnessing many phenomena and experiencing many facts firsthand, and cannot help but raise questions.

Will the Communist Party establish a government in Beiping? What kind of political system will it use? What name? What flag? …This series of questions are on the minds of the residents, hoping to get answers.

According to my personal understanding, the Communist Party will inevitably establish a national people's government in Beiping. As for the time and manner of its establishment, it will depend on the development of the overall situation and international changes. Or, it is likely to be formally formed after the New Political Consultative Conference. According to Mao Zedong's two articles published during the Anti-Japanese War, "On New Democracy" and "On Coalition Government," as well as recent editorials in the Xinhua Daily and broadcasts from the Chinese Communist Party, the future national people's government will still be in the form of a coalition government, implementing the "three-thirds system": one-third for the Communist Party, one-third for progressive elements of the Nationalist Party and various democratic parties, and one-third for social elites. An editorial in the Xinhua Daily stated: "Overthrow the reactionary rule of the Nationalist Party throughout the country, and establish a people's democratic dictatorship republic led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance throughout the country." It also said: "In 1949, a Political Consultative Conference will be convened without the participation of reactionary elements, with the goal of completing the people's revolutionary tasks, declaring the establishment of the People's Democratic Republic of China, and forming the central government of the republic. This government will be a democratic coalition government under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, with the participation of appropriate representatives from various democratic parties and people's organizations." Isn't this a clear indication of their attitude and approach? According to recent newspaper reports, as a result of the meeting of representatives from various parties in Fanyang to discuss the matter, the political system will adopt a federal system. The name of their state will be the "People's Democratic Republic of China," and the flag will be a sickle, an axe, and a star, with a red background and yellow designs. The flag currently used by the People's Liberation Army is such a flag. Based on these many conditions and facts, it is, of course, a fundamental negation and overthrow of the existing Nanjing Nationalist government. Mao Zedong's eight-point peace declaration, which included the abolition of the puppet regime and the abolition of the puppet constitution, has also blatantly stated this intention.

### Western European Five-Nation Consultative Conference Opens, Discussing Joint Defense and Other Issues, Foreign, Finance, and Military Leaders All Attend

[Reuters, London, 14th] The Consultative Committee meeting of the Western European Union opened in London this morning to discuss defense issues. A press release from the British Foreign Office announced that the current meeting was opened by British Foreign Secretary Bevin. Attendees included British Foreign Secretary Bevin, French Foreign Minister Schuman, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker, and Luxembourg representative Dupont. The agenda for the meeting included three points: the Atlantic Pact, the Western European Constitution, and Western European Defense. This consultative conference is the most important one since the establishment of the Western European Union. In addition to the foreign ministers of the five countries, a large number of defense experts and advisors, as well as senior officers from the three armed forces, attended the meeting of this Western European Union decision-making body. After the usual opening ceremony and preliminary discussions, the meeting was immediately divided into three subgroups for secret discussions. Diplomatic circles believe that the military committee of the Western European Union Consultative Committee, under the chairmanship of Marshal Montgomery, will reach an agreement on the following three points: (1) Appoint General Eisenhower as the Supreme Commander of the Army of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, with Marshal Montgomery as his deputy. Headquarters may be established in London. (2) Distribute surplus US military supplies to the countries of the Atlantic Pact. (3) Supply France and the Netherlands with the latest British and American jet propulsion aircraft.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th] The Western European Five-Nation Consultative Committee is composed of the foreign ministers of the five countries and meets every three months. This meeting differs from previous meetings in two respects: (1) The meeting was held ahead of schedule. The original date was April 25, but before that date, there will be two new developments: the signing of the Atlantic Pact and the holding of a ten-nation conference to establish a European parliament as the central body of the European Union. Therefore, the countries of the Brussels Pact decided to meet before these events occur to reach an agreement on details and procedures. (2) The meeting has been expanded. In addition to the foreign ministers of the five countries, the ministers of defense and finance are also participating in the discussions. This indicates that the meeting will focus on the military and financial issues arising from the Atlantic Pact, such as US military aid, the distribution of this aid among Western European countries, mutual assistance among these countries in rearmament, and the responsibilities that each country should bear in common defense and mutual assistance.

### Icelandic Foreign Minister Arrives in Washington, D.C. for Talks with the U.S. Secretary of State; U.S. Guarantees No Use of Bases Without Consent

[Report from Our Newspaper] Washington, 14th (Broadcast): Icelandic Foreign Minister Benediktsson arrived in Washington, D.C. yesterday and is scheduled to visit Acheson today.

Danish Foreign Minister Rasmusson also visited Assistant Secretary of State Gross today for talks and submitted a form requesting arms assistance for Denmark.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 13th] The Icelandic Foreign Minister said after arriving here today that Iceland will never agree to other countries establishing military bases in Iceland during peacetime.

### Soviet Newspaper Criticizes U.S. Mediterranean Policy

[Reuters, Moscow, 13th] Soviet commentator Denisov published an article in the "Red Fleet Newspaper" here today, pointing out that militarists in the United States want to turn Mediterranean countries into military bases for aggression against the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries.

The submarines and minesweepers supplied by the United States have been stationed in naval bases such as Alexandria, Messina, and Izmir. The island of Cyprus has become a joint British-American military base, and military engineering is also being actively carried out on the island of Sicily in Italy. In addition, the United States intends to invade the African continent.

Troops, tanks, and light armored vehicles were all transported ashore by landing craft, while military aircraft also landed slowly on the land. British troops and Israeli army outposts are only a few kilometers apart, and British troops are currently on alert.

[Reuters, London, 13th] Amman, the capital of Transjordan, officially announced that British reinforcements have landed at the port of Aqaba on the north coast of the Red Sea. At the same time, according to reports from Tel Aviv, the Israeli government announced that it has occupied a 10-kilometer-long coastline along the Gulf of Aqaba, called the Eilat area. According to well-informed sources here, the British troops stationed in Aqaba will adopt a strict non-interference policy towards the actions of Jews on the Red Sea coast of Palestine. Aqaba is about three kilometers from the border between Transjordan and Israel, and the presence of British troops is unlikely to cause trouble. Israel's occupation of the Eilat area allows it to obtain a seaport on the Red Sea. A spokesman for the British War Office declined to comment on the report from Amman that British troops had landed in Aqaba. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office also said that the strength of the British troops stationed in Aqaba is a military secret. An Israeli military spokesman pointed out that the military action in the Gulf of Aqaba was the result of changing the military station area in the Negev region in accordance with the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Egypt. Observers also said that the Israeli government has always insisted on its sovereignty in the Eilat area, so it will never sign any agreement with Transjordan that does not confirm this right. The Israeli army began to advance towards the Eilat area after occupying the city of Beersheba in southern Palestine last October, in order to open up a land route to the Dead Sea potash factory area. Potash is one of the main exports of Israel.

### Inside Story of the Robbery at the Hotel; More Startling Discoveries; One of the Five Male Strange Guests is Actually a China National Aviation Corporation Pilot

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Behind the scenes of the hijacking of China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Qingdao flight, despite the relevant authorities maintaining secrecy, reporters have made new and startling discoveries after various inquiries, revealing the truth. It is reported that among the five male passengers who hijacked the plane, apart from Xing Guozheng, Hua Xinghang, and Liu Shurong, who were employees of the Civil Aviation Administration, the other two, Li Yun, was actually a pilot of China National Aviation Corporation himself, and Chen Tiesheng, was a mechanic from another airline in this city.

Li Yun is one of the co-pilots of China National Aviation Corporation. Reporters confirmed this with the company authorities yesterday. However, it is claimed that this person was dismissed by the company several months ago due to poor technical skills and inability to become a full pilot.

Chen Tiesheng is a mechanic from another airline in this city. Due to time constraints, it was not possible to confirm this with the company yesterday, but this information was revealed by reliable sources and is believed to be true.

The Civil Aviation Administration's Air Traffic Control Station has admitted that Xing Guozheng, Hua Xinghang, and Liu Shurong were once staff members of the station, but it is claimed that these people were dismissed a year ago due to staff reductions.

According to reporters, Li Yun, Xing Guozheng, and the other five people had previously served in the Air Force and were classmates who went to the United States for training. After returning to China, either they were eliminated or dissatisfied with reality, and under the temptation of Communist propaganda, they conspired in this hijacking. As for whether they had contact with the Communists beforehand, it is not known. Since they were employees of the company and the Civil Aviation Administration, they must have known the co-pilot Shu Zhilun and the telegraph operator Wang Qingyuan on Flight 135. Therefore, according to yesterday's Qingdao telegraph from this newspaper, when they launched the hijacking and used guns to threaten them, Shu and Wang even said, "Don't joke around."

### Petition to Allocate Funds to Reissue Cooking Oil to Public Servants and Teachers

### Book Industry Accuses National Bank of Unfairness for Not Receiving Loans; Discount and Loan Committee Issues Statement; Loans to Commercial Press and Others Not for Paper; They Are for Printing National Textbooks

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Discount and Loan Committee of the Central Bank, in response to a newspaper report that the 416 members of the Shanghai Book Industry Association questioned the unfair allocation of paper by the Central Bank and an urgent announcement questioning Central Bank Governor Liu Gongyun and Business Bureau Director Lin Chongyong, issued the following statement: The Commercial Press and other bookstores have been approved by the Ministry of Education to print national textbooks for many years. Every year, during the two seasons, they are approved by the Four Banks Joint Treasury and receive loans from national banking institutions to make textbook prices particularly low, thereby reducing the burden on primary and secondary school students across the country. These loans are not given for the allocation of paper. When the Four Banks Joint Treasury was ordered to be abolished and the business was transferred to the National Bank Discount and Loan Committee, the Ministry of Education sent a letter to the National Bank in December of last year requesting that loans of 44.462 million yuan be granted according to the established case and sent representatives to Shanghai for consultation. The committee approved a loan of 15 million yuan, and the number of borrowers and the distribution ratio were handled according to the Ministry of Education's opinion. In February of this year, nineteen bookstores stated that prices had fluctuated sharply and that the amount previously borrowed was insufficient. They sent another letter to the National Bank requesting an increase in the loan amount. The 26th Discount and Loan Committee meeting on February 14 resolved to approve an increase in the loan to 150 million yuan according to the previous case, still designated for the printing of national textbooks. As for Wanye Bookstore and other four bookstores, they were also approved to print national textbooks and hold certificates from the Ministry of Education to apply for loans. The National Bank Discount and Loan Committee loaned them the remaining 1.5 million yuan from the 150 million yuan, averaging about 370,000 yuan per bookstore.

### No Precedent for Applying for Loan to Cover Paper Allocation Costs; Inconvenient to Grant Loan

On February 25, Baisin Bookstore and other 466 bookstores applied for a loan to cover the cost of paper allocation. As usual, this was submitted to the 28th Discount and Loan Committee meeting on March 1 for deliberation. At that time, the attending committee members felt that the funds loaned to the Commercial Press and other bookstores in the past were used for printing national textbooks, not for covering the cost of paper allocation. The request from the 466 bookstores was very different, and there was no precedent to follow. It was inconvenient to grant the loan. Furthermore, the National Bank had small industrial loans to support small factories. The more than 400 bookstores had printing houses attached and met the requirements for small industrial loans. They could apply for small industrial loans according to their scale and equipment to cope with the situation. It was resolved that this case should be politely rejected. The above is the situation of the National Bank Discount and Loan Committee approving loans to nineteen bookstores and rejecting other bookstores.

### Book Industry Sends Representatives to the National Bank for Consultation

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to the Book Industry Association yesterday, the local publishing industry was unable to order paper for the sixth season due to the sharp rise in foreign exchange transfer certificates, and the paper stocks of various bookstores had long been used up. If the supply of paper was interrupted, the publishing industry would inevitably be forced to close down, seriously affecting the supply of spiritual food. Therefore, the association had repeatedly requested the Central Bank to advance funds for the entire order, as was done for the newspaper industry. However, the Central Bank only approved loans to a small number of large bookstores (19) and rejected the requests of more than 400 bookstores. This matter was heard by bookstores throughout the city, and the public was in a state of anxiety, raising questions one after another. In addition to publishing appeals in newspapers to ask all sectors of society to uphold justice, it is reported that the association has publicly appointed Chairman Zhang Yiqu, Supervisor Du Yuesheng, and standing directors Yu Shun, Huang Zhongming, Wang Zicheng, and others to mediate the solution and will visit Governor Liu of the Central Bank today (the 15th) for consultation.

### The Truth About the Murder Case on Jiangsu Road Remains Elusive; It is Determined That There Was More Than One Perpetrator; It Was Neither Revenge Killing Nor Murder for Money

[Report from our newspaper] Although various parties have been working hard to investigate the murder case of Wu Li Xiuzhen, a housewife residing at No. 46, Alley A, No. 76, Jiangsu Road, for days, no important discoveries have been made. According to the reporter's inquiries from various relevant parties, at least several points can be determined regarding the perpetrator(s): (1) The deceased had a total of sixteen fatal wounds, which were puncture wounds rather than cuts. The deceased's body was kneeling in front of the bed, and the radio in the room was moved to the back door and the volume turned up high during the crime, proving that there was definitely more than one perpetrator. (2) Although the deceased's family has many members, they go to work in factories or attend school early in the morning, leaving only the deceased at home in the morning. The perpetrators acted at this time, proving that it was a long-planned scheme and that they seemed to be unusually familiar with the deceased's family. (3) The deceased had been married to her husband, Wu Shiren, for eleven years. Because of his honest and kind nature, he had good relationships with his family and neighbors. Furthermore, she managed the household affairs and rarely went out. In the past, she had never had disputes, borrowed money, or been involved in lawsuits. The perpetrators did not take away any property after committing the crime, proving that this case was not a revenge killing or murder for money. According to general speculation, the deceased was thirty-five years old when she married Wu, so the perpetrator(s) may have been someone she knew before she was thirty-five, or someone who held a grudge for some reason. Later, they moved far away to another place and recently found an opportunity to commit this heinous crime. However, according to the reporter's interview with the deceased's mother's family, they stated that they could not confirm this point because the deceased had never been in love or had disagreements with anyone before her marriage. Therefore, a similar love triangle murder is definitely impossible.

### To Adapt to Martial Law Hours; Timetables on Both Lines Revised Starting on the 20th; Direct Train Service to Guangzhou Extended

[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration has decided to revise the train timetable starting on the 20th of this month to adapt to the martial law hours and adjust the passenger flow on both lines.

### Faculty and Staff of National Universities and Colleges Unanimously Insist on Receiving Salaries According to the Index; The Professors' Association Decides to Issue a Protest Letter to the Government

[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Regional National College and University Professors' Association held its sixth regular meeting yesterday afternoon at Jiaotong University. Regarding the issue of compensation, the meeting believed that when the university presidents petitioned in Nanjing last time, the person in charge of the Ministry of Education had verbally agreed to pay salaries at 500 times the base rate. Subsequently, the Ministry of Education suddenly sent a telegram instructing that the March salaries should be calculated at three times the February standard of 75 times the base rate. This was a breach of faith. It was decided to issue a protest letter to the government, insisting on the two principles of not discounting the original salary and issuing salaries according to the price index. At the same time, the presidents of each school were asked to expedite the issuance of March salaries. Sympathy was expressed for the self-funded students' efforts to obtain public funding. The association decided to establish a welfare association, with Tongji, Shanghai Medical, and Shanghai Business schools responsible for promoting it. A letter was sent to the Economic Research Institute of Fudan University and the Chinese Economic Research Institute requesting them to provide price index data and to maintain regular contact with the welfare association.

In addition, it was decided to establish a Higher Education System Research Committee, with Jiaotong, Tongji, and Fudan universities responsible, and Jiaotong University serving as the convener.

The professors of National Yingshi University in Jinhua wanted to join the association. After discussion at yesterday's meeting, they were welcomed. Because various schools outside of Shanghai were joining, the association's organizational charter needed to be revised and will be discussed at the next meeting. The next meeting is scheduled for 2:00 PM on March 27th at Fudan University.

Also, the Shanghai Municipal National College and University Teaching Assistants and Lecturers Association, dissatisfied with the salary multipliers and the cancellation of in-kind allocations in favor of differential payments, decided at a meeting yesterday to demand: (1) Salaries be paid fully according to the local index. (2) In-kind allocations continue as usual.

### The Problem of Refugee Students; The Authorities Feel Deeply Troubled; Food May Be Interrupted

[Report from our newspaper] The Municipal Bureau of Education and the Bureau of Social Affairs feel that the problem of refugee students from Northeast and Shandong coming to Shanghai is difficult to solve. When Acting Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education came to Shanghai a few days ago, Director Li asked him for a solution. Chen promised to send someone to Shanghai to handle this matter, but has not yet arrived. Although the Shandong Provincial Department of Education has an office in Shanghai, it also has no way to settle the refugee students in Shanghai. The food problem of refugee students is temporarily being relieved by the Bureau of Social Affairs, but this congee distribution is about to stop. Both bureaus of social affairs and education sincerely hope that the central government will have a comprehensive solution to the problem of refugee students.

### Staff of Various Schools Urge the Issuance of In-Kind Goods

[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai National College and University Staff Association has elected Jiaotong, Fudan, Jinan, Tongji, and Shanghai Business schools as executive directors, with Jinan University serving as the association's communication address. In addition to asking the presidents of various universities to forward the request for professional development fees to the authorities, the association has also telegraphed Acting President Li, the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Education. In addition, it was decided to join the Professors' Association and the Municipal Primary and Secondary School Faculty and Staff Association to urge the relevant authorities to quickly issue the allocated coal briquettes and cooking oil.

[Report from our newspaper] The Fudan University Workers' Association began signing petitions on the 13th, making three demands: (1) The base salary be adjusted to 60 yuan. (2) Salaries be paid fully according to the local cost of living index. (3) Professional development and training fees be issued.

### Self-Funded Students Petition; Departure Date Not Yet Determined

[Report from our newspaper] The departure date of the petition representatives from the Shanghai Municipal National College and University Federation to Nanjing has not yet been determined. At the same time, publicly funded students in each school also believe that the public funds are insufficient and the meals are too poor, and demand that the public funds be adjusted according to the price index, and join the self-funded students' struggle for public funds as a "struggle for survival" movement. Jiaotong University students have established a "Struggle for Survival Committee" and scheduled a "Speak Bitterness" evening party this Thursday to tell about the current plight of teachers, students and staff.

### Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff Visit the Director of the Bureau of Education to Request Five Items

[Report from our newspaper] The Municipal Primary and Secondary School Faculty and Staff Association has dispatched representatives Xi Zhenken, Zhou He, Li Zhanren, Mao Wenpei, etc., to visit Director Li of the Bureau of Education, requesting several points: (1) Please reissue the salary for February according to the original base salary, without any deductions, multiplied by the cost of living index. (2) Please expedite the preliminary issuance of the salary for March according to the original base salary multiplied by the cost of living index. (3) In-kind allocation of public education has been delayed for several periods, such as cooking oil and coal briquettes. Please transfer to the competent authority to quickly reissue them, and hope that they can be issued on time in the future. (4) Please refer to the base salary of other civil servants to increase the base salary of teachers to emphasize education. (5) Request that the welfare benefits of public educators in this city be the same, and that the children of colleagues of city school faculty and staff can also obtain education loans. Director Li stated that he would forward the request to the mayor for approval.

### Private Universities and Colleges Decide to Form a Federation

[Report from our newspaper] The presidents of various private universities and colleges in this city held a symposium yesterday at the Tsinghua Alumni Association. 27 people attended, including Ou Yuanhuai, Ling Xianyang, Wang Yukai, Hu Dunfu, Zhao Xiuhong, Liao Shicheng, and Liu Haisu. It was decided to formally organize the Shanghai Municipal Private College and University Federation. Because the organizational charter and other matters still need to be discussed, the establishment date will be in one or two weeks.

At yesterday's symposium, regarding the spring break issue for private universities and colleges this semester, it was decided that the vacation should be based on the principle of three days, and the vacation dates should be determined by each school.

### University Students from Peiping and Tianjin Arrive in Shanghai; Discuss Northern Education; The Chinese Communists Run Three Universities in Peiping

[Report from our newspaper] Zhang Zhendong and five other students from Fu Jen Catholic University in Peiping, Li Shaoyuan and several other students from Chaoyang University, and Wu Zhengtao and nine other students from the Tianjin National Guoshu Physical Education Teachers College recently arrived in Shanghai. The reporter made a special visit to their residence to inquire about the situation of the schools in Peiping and Tianjin. According to the students from Chaoyang and other schools, they and a group of more than ten people left Peiping for Tianjin on the 26th of last month. On the 27th, nine classmates from Guoshu Physical Education Teachers College joined them. They passed through Cangxian and transferred to Jinan. Because they had travel permits, they were not hindered along the way. They registered in Qingdao, took a free boat, and arrived in Shanghai on the 12th. Currently, the Chinese Communists run three universities in Peiping: (1) North China University, which graduates in two years. (2) Military and Political University. (3) People's Revolutionary University, which graduates in four months. The original food allowance for students of national universities was 45 catties of millet per person, and 120 catties of millet for professors. Private universities have difficulty maintaining themselves due to a lack of funding and considerable restrictions on tuition fees. It is difficult for students to study in private universities except those who volunteer to join the three universities run by the Chinese Communists. According to the students of Guoshu Physical Education Teachers College, the school is temporarily managed by a person elected from among the professors by the professors' association. The Chinese Communists have sent two instructors to the school, abolished the Department of Student Affairs, and removed courses such as scouting, military training, civics, ethics, and Chinese language (Chinese language will be revised). In addition to teaching, teachers have study sessions in the morning, reading designated books. In the evening, review meetings are held to review study issues. Teachers and students cooperate in labor service. It is reported that the students from the three schools who came south will go to Hangzhou to discuss transfer issues with the office of the Ministry of Education. It is also reported that dozens of students from other universities in Peiping and Tianjin, such as Peking University and Northeastern University, have also come to Shanghai to contact the Municipal Bureau of Education. The bureau has provided guidance on food and accommodation issues and instructed them to wait for the person in charge sent by the Ministry of Education to contact them directly regarding transfer registration.

### Extinguishing the Wildfires in Western Hunan; Focusing on Appeasement Rather Than Suppression is the Way to Cut Off the Fuel

— Special Correspondent Huang Chao Ru

[Aviation Report from Changsha, May 5th] Western Hunan is located at the tail end of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, with overlapping mountains and impoverished areas. This place originally belonged to an uncivilized area. It was only after the Miao Rebellion during the Qing Yongzheng period that it was transformed from Tusi (local chieftain) rule to Liuguan (government official) rule. However, due to the special topography of the country and the low level of education of the people, even though it was changed from Tusi to Liuguan rule, local forces were still particularly strong. The only difference was that the ruling power was transferred from the hands of the Miao chieftains to some Han Chinese bullies. Until the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Western Hunan was still a mysterious area in the eyes of the Chinese people. It was filled with bandits and tyrannical local bullies, and few outsiders dared to set foot in it.

After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, due to its topography, Western Hunan was blessed and the enemy's hooves never set foot on this land. It became a paradise, and refugee groups flocked to it. The closed Western Hunan was opened. However, it was not easy for "people from the lower river" (people from Western Hunan call people below Changtao "people from the lower river," and Sichuanese people call people from other provinces "people from the lower river") to pour into this mysterious area. In the beginning, the government had to go through a lot of trouble. First, they used all kinds of tricks to get the "King of Western Hunan," Chen Quzhen, to transfer his troops out of Hunan, and then invited Chen himself to live as a recluse in the suburbs of Chongqing. In addition, the central government sent Commander Gu Zhenglun, known as "Tiger Gu," to set up the Gendarmerie Headquarters in Zhijiang, responsible for suppressing bandits in Western Hunan. In Western Hunan, in order to eradicate banditry, "Tiger Gu" sometimes did not hesitate to slaughter entire villages. The provincial government also established an administrative office in Yuanling and established a garrison headquarters. At that time, when the local forces had not been eradicated at all, the official documents of Garrison Commander Sun Changjun could not even leave the headquarters gate. Commander Sun carefully dealt with the environment through repeated concessions and compromises. When a suitable opportunity arose, he used lightning-fast means to kill a famous local bully, which temporarily suppressed the situation and gradually brought order back on track. Later, not only Yuanling and Zhijiang became paradises for "people from the lower river," but even Qiancheng and Yongshun and other places had traces of outsiders. After the National College of Commerce, National Eighth Middle School, Chadong Normal School, and other schools were established in this barbaric area, young students full of vigor and vitality could be seen on the ridges of the mountains and the banks of the rivers, and the music of pioneers of the times could be heard. At that time, no one living in this area would have thought that this was the mysterious area that outsiders had regarded as a dangerous place they dared not set foot in a few years ago. Western Hunan was transformed and its appearance was completely different.

The People of Western Hunan Are Not Afraid of Hardship

Western Hunan changed its appearance, and the mystery was revealed. It gave "people from the lower river" the impression that the common people here were not the imagined red-eyed and green-browed judges, but rather the typical honest and kind Chinese people. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the reporter fled here from the distant lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and was most interested in the fact that this was a place where people did not pick up lost items. Clothes were dried on the threshing floor, and they were not collected indoors at night, and nothing would be lost. The people of Western Hunan are simple, straightforward, stubborn, and fond of fighting. They hate stealing most of all. If they cannot solve their livelihood, they will take a kitchen knife to kill and rob, and that is the hero everyone admires. They are most afraid of hardship, and they will resist any pressure. I remember that on the eve of the Battle of Western Hunan, the 18th Army stationed in the Changtao area had very bad discipline, and the people of Changtao were as docile and sheep-like and never dared to resist. Later, the army was transferred to the Chenxi area, and one division with the worst discipline was stationed in Pushi, forcibly occupying civilian houses, which aroused resentment from the local people. They gathered guns, knives, and spears and attacked the military camp at night, killing more than 80 soldiers of the National Army. The 18th Army, which had modern weapons, was actually suppressed by these fearless people from Western Hunan.

The Ambitious Ones Raise Their Heads Again

During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people of Western Hunan, like people in other parts of the country, contributed money and manpower, especially manpower, because the people of Western Hunan liked to fight and were not afraid to be soldiers, so there were many conscriptions. However, the situation was not necessarily very smooth. As mentioned earlier, the true ruling power in Western Hunan was completely in the hands of a few local bullies. Conscription had to go through the hands of the village chiefs, and the village chiefs were representatives or pawns of the local bullies. The kind people of Western Hunan inevitably suffered from the exploitation of the village chiefs. As a result, there was a bandit Peng Jiaoluzi in the Yongshun area, who roamed Western Hunan for several years under the banner of resisting Japan and resisting grain. It was not until the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan that it was suppressed by Chuan Zhongfang.

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the political center of Hunan moved back to Changsha, and a large number of "people from the lower river" gradually left Western Hunan. Gradually, this place became a world where "the heavens are high and the emperor is far away." A few local ambitious elements slowly raised their heads. They used the psychology of the poor people to grow tobacco, resist grain, and resist conscription to create toxins in the local area. When the time was right, they seized an opportunity and rose up in rebellion. From the victory to today, three years have passed, and it should be ripe. Therefore, in the midst of the turbulence of the entire national situation, Western Hunan was the first to be chaotic before the world, and returned to the chaotic situation of ten years ago. Today's Western Hunan is full of flames everywhere, and the whole area is in turmoil.

Local Bullies Hold Great Power

The outbreak of this incident in Western Hunan was due to the 17th Pacification District's reorganization of local guns. There are many civilian guns in Western Hunan. According to unofficial statistics, there are more than 100,000. It is not unreasonable for the 17th Pacification District to want to use these civilian guns for the country. However, the technology was not thorough, especially ignoring the local forces here, and wanted to achieve its goal by purely political means. In other places, the people are afraid of the officials. With a simple order, it can be done. However, the situation in Western Hunan is not so simple. The civilian guns are in the hands of some local bullies. To put it mildly, this is to protect their own lives and property. To put it bluntly, they completely rely on these civilian guns to cultivate their own power in the local area. Now that the government wants to take them away from them, it is bound to arouse resentment. In the lunar month of last year, the 17th Pacification District sent personnel to Yongshun to order the local civilian guns (self-defense forces) to be reorganized into survey and construction brigades. The orders were swift and severe, and the county magistrate naturally obeyed the order. Cao Zhenya, the deputy commander of the self-defense general team (also the chief of the Yongshun police station), who held the power of the civilian guns, announced a rebellion.

The Wildfire Burns Endlessly

Before the Yongshun incident broke out, many counties in Western Hunan were already unstable. Huang Qi (the younger brother of County Magistrate Huang Yingchuan, who was killed in Dayong) in Baojing gathered thousands of people and guns out of anger that his brother's great revenge had not been avenged. Luo Bingwu in Guzhang also had more than a thousand people. Chen Zixia and Luo Yun in Longshan gathered hundreds of people. There was also a Hunan University student, Miss Tian Guang, who raised an army to avenge her father, Tian Hezhong, who was assassinated, and her army also had about six or seven hundred people. Hu Yan, a middle school student in Sangzhi. Long Feitian in Mayang has an even greater momentum. Cao Zhenya's actions in Yongshun were echoed by them, and they all rose up in rebellion, creating an all-out war. In the past few days, Mayang was the first to be captured by Long Feitian, followed by Yuanling, the heart of Western Hunan, which was captured by Cao Zhenya, and Luxi and Chenxi became dangerous cities. As of the time the reporter was writing, Pushi, a major town in Western Hunan, had also fallen. Wildfires burn endlessly, and the spring breeze blows again. The bloody Western Hunan is seen again today after ten years.

In response to the rebellion in Western Hunan, the provincial government decided to focus on appeasement rather than suppression, sending troops to suppress the rebellion on the one hand and sending provincial commissioner Dai Jitao and others to promote appeasement on the other. Dai is from Fenghuang. More than 20 years ago, he was like Cao Zhenya and others in Western Hunan today, and served as a division commander under Chen Quzhen. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he led his troops to fight on the battlefield and was more intelligent than other military men in Western Hunan. With his prestige, when he arrives in Western Hunan, juniors like Cao Zhenya will have to lower their heads. Everyone is eagerly hoping that Commissioner Dai's trip will not be in vain and that he will use the method of cutting off the fuel from under the cauldron to extinguish the wildfires in Western Hunan invisibly.

### Wuxi Police Bureau Handles Drug Case, Stages a "Catch and Release Cao"

[Our newspaper's Wuxi 13th dispatch] Hou Zhenying, a female resident of No. 33 on the Bo'an Embankment in the city, was arrested by the Guangfu Gate police station on suspicion of drug trafficking. After being handed over to the city police bureau and then to the general bureau, she was released on bail on the grounds that Hou was seriously ill. However, all case files were transferred to the district prosecutor's office. The handling prosecutor, Shi Yanqing, believing that the main suspect in the case was out on bail and repeatedly failing to appear for questioning, which made investigation impossible, and that Hou Zhenying's claim of being extorted for three taels of gold jewelry should also be investigated, considered the case to be suspiciously like a "Catch and Release Cao" scenario. He issued a statement hoping that police officers would not fall into the trap of dereliction of duty and corruption.

The entire college's 443 students are on the verge of destitution. To save themselves, they have decided to stage the play "Night Shop" for three days starting on the 18th of this month at the Wuxi Grand Theater, with all proceeds going to purchase grain for sustenance.

### Shaoxing Third Self-Defense Platoon, Demands Back Pay Without Success, Creates Uproar

[Our newspaper's Shaoxing 12th dispatch] The Third Company of the Self-Defense Regiment stationed in Ping Shui Che Tou (over 40 li from the city) under the Shaoxing County Self-Defense Headquarters suddenly mutinied at 9 PM on the 10th. Investigation revealed that the company had not received its January pay, and the hope of receiving February pay was even more distant. Although the third platoon leader, Zhang Zhiying, repeatedly requested the company commander, Yu Heming, to forward the request to the headquarters for payment, it was to no avail. This aroused the anger of all the soldiers in the third platoon. At 9 PM on the 10th, Platoon Leader Zhang ordered all the soldiers to gather and rush to the stationed location of the nearby First Platoon, disarming them all and abducting Chen Zhongqiao, the instructor of the First Platoon. The Second Platoon received the news and rushed to intercept them, but were unable to encounter them because they were traveling in opposite directions. The next morning, Chen Zhongqiao, the instructor of the First Platoon, escaped and came to the city to report to Lin Ze, who concurrently served as the commander, and Hou Zhuangyan, the deputy commander. Commander Lin, upon hearing the news, not only detained Company Commander Yu Heming but also ordered the police stations and requested the garrison troops to search and suppress the mutineers in separate directions.

### Hexi Water Conservancy Project

— Our newspaper reporter Song Lin

[Our newspaper's Lanzhou 9th dispatch] In order to rebuild Hexi and utilize the snowmelt from the Qilian Mountains to irrigate farmland, the Gansu Provincial Government is cooperating with the Hexi Water Conservancy Engineering Office of the Ministry of Water Resources for surveying and construction. This year, in addition to three engineering projects that still need surveying and design, funds must be requested for construction to increase wheat production by 500,000 shi. The construction and renovation of irrigation projects this year will be completed as scheduled. It is estimated that 490,000 mu of land can be irrigated, and wheat production can be increased by 500,000 shi annually. If small-scale water conservancy projects are included, 890,000 mu of land can be irrigated, and wheat production can be increased by 770,000 shi annually. The harvest is truly astonishing.

The current situation of the Hexi water conservancy project is as follows, with the more important ones listed:

(1) Shandan Baishi Cliff River, supplying drinking water for military horses and irrigation project: The location of this project is between the Shandan Dama Ying military pasture and the foothills of the Qilian Mountains. The pasture lacks water sources, and there are about 30,000 mu of uncultivated wasteland. It is planned to build a dam on the Baishi Cliff River to divert water to supply drinking water for military horses and for irrigation. The entire project has been designed. However, the Ministry of Water Resources did not approve it because it considered the project to be different in nature from other projects. The provincial government has now separately requested the Ministry of National Defense and the Northwest Military and Political Chief Executive's Office to allocate special funds for handling it.

(2) Shandan Interception and Diversion of Groundwater Irrigation Project: This is the most economical and simplest project to solve the water shortage in Hexi. Last year, a loan of 23.1 billion legal currency was obtained, and construction began in May. Approval was also obtained from the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling American Relief Supplies for assistance funds, totaling 30 billion legal currency. Currently, 75% of the entire project has been completed. This year, it will be extended westward, and after completion, it can irrigate 6,000 mu of land.

(3) Jiuquan Zhongqu Fort Interception and Diversion of Groundwater Irrigation Project: Construction will begin in the spring, and after completion, it can irrigate 12,000 mu of land, increasing wheat production by 20,000 shi annually.

(4) Jiuquan Bianwan Interception and Diversion of Groundwater Irrigation Project: 10,000 mu can be cultivated and irrigated first in the spring of this year; the Jiabianwan small reservoir has been completed.

(5) Gulang Gutai Canal Renovation Project: A loan of 13.5 billion legal currency has been approved by the Ministry of Water Resources, and an additional 43,300 gold yuan has been allocated. The plan is to irrigate 8,000 mu first.

The remaining renovation project of the old canal on the Gulang Dajing River is underway. The renovation projects of Linze Wuyan Canal and Xila Canal have also been designed and sent to the Ministry of Water Resources for handling with American aid. The Bulongji Interception and Diversion of Groundwater Irrigation Project in Anxi outside the pass is in progress.

The raising of the spillway and repair project of the Yuanyang Pond in Jinta last year has been completed in its entirety, increasing the water storage capacity by one-third compared to before. This year, it can increase irrigation by 30,000 mu, bringing the total irrigation area to 130,000 mu, which can increase wheat production by 130,000 shi annually.

Huang Wanli, the director of the Gansu Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau and concurrently the director of the Hexi Water Conservancy Engineering Office, intends to fly to Guangzhou in the near future to discuss matters related to Hexi water conservancy with the Ministry of Water Resources.

### Perspective on the 1,500+ Kilometer-Long Yangtze River Defense Line Between Nanjing and Shanghai

— Our newspaper reporter He Xianglin

[Our newspaper's Zhenjiang 13th dispatch] Due to the turbulent situation, with the overall situation unclear, the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have been blockaded since the 9th of this month. Passenger liners of various companies in Liuxu, Shierxu, and Guazhou in Zhenjiang have been ordered to suspend operations, prohibiting travel to and from the south and north. The entire river surface is in a state of silence. However, the people living in Zhenjiang are not panicking because of this. Today, the Yangtze River is undoubtedly facing a major historical test.

"Waiting but unable to return home" and "The spring river flows eastward" - these two lines of poetry perfectly capture the scene at the Zhenjiang wharf today. In the past, there were bustling crowds and the calls of stevedores, but since the full blockade of the river on the 9th, these have completely disappeared. Although many people on Pingzheng Bridge are craning their necks to look, what they see are a few warships docked in the middle of the river and the boundless river water, which makes people feel empty and lost. The First Pacification District Headquarters, in order to deal with the problem of ship import and export management, has established a ship management station in Zhenjiang by the river. The station began operations on the 10th, with Tang Xuejun, a technical specialist from the Department of Construction, serving as the stationmaster. He is actively carrying out his work.

Under the major principle that everything is for military purposes, the "river blockade" is of course necessary. Most things pass through without staying. Many materials need to be supplied from the north of the river, such as pork, vegetables, grain, and firewood. After the river blockade, prices have soared several times. In addition, many civilian ships and steamers are directly affected because they have stopped operating. Thousands of crew members and dockworkers are finding it impossible to maintain their livelihoods. The Steamer Association has convened an emergency meeting to discuss the issue of steamers stopped on the north bank of the river and requisitioned. The crew's food and coal consumption used to be subsidized by the military station, but now they have to handle it themselves. It was decided to add an extra 1.5 tons of coal per ship to maintain military transport.

Xie Bi, the magistrate of Zhenjiang County, is also very concerned about the source of materials and security issues after the river blockade. On the 11th, he urgently decided the following with Wang Youzhi, the city defense commander: (1) Passengers getting off the train at the station and planning to take small boats on the Jinshan River to cross the river north should be persuaded by the Provincial Police Bureau and the Transportation Control Station to disperse and not gather there to avoid causing trouble. (2) The business hours of silver shops are set to close before 6 PM. (3) Since the blockade of the river, the Chamber of Commerce and the Labor Union will discuss a number of unemployed workers and passengers short of expenses and submit detailed measures to request relief from the provincial government. (4) Zhenjiang firewood has always been supplied by the Shiye Zhou and Heshang Zhou across the river. Since the blockade of the river, the citizens' fuel supply has become a problem. Relevant units will formulate appropriate measures and request instructions from the provincial government. (5) The water and electricity company has only enough coal to last until the 15th. Although there are more than 100 tons of coal in Nanjing, they cannot be transported to Zhenjiang because the tugboats are blocked. It has been decided that the city defense headquarters will issue passports to rush the transport to Zhenjiang.

According to a military observer, the Yangtze River is a large river after all, and human wave tactics will not work. Therefore, the Communist army has to seek other strategies to cross the river. Generally speaking, their methods of crossing the river are: (1) Taking advantage of dark nights and high winds to carry out stealthy crossings. (2) Crossing while negotiating, making crossing the river a prerequisite for peace talks, and then discussing after crossing the river. (3) "Money can make the devil turn the millstone," using gold and silver as bribes to cross the river. (4) The hardline approach, directly attacking across the river. Looking at the four methods above: (1) Large-scale stealthy crossings are easily discovered by the navy and air force. Before they are used, they may be destroyed first, making it impossible for the Communist army to gather. If it is a sporadic stealthy crossing, the strength of this force is limited, and before it has a firm foothold, it is easier to be attacked jointly by the sea, land, and air forces. Therefore, the Communist army will not make this unwise move. (2) There is no shortage of talented people in the National Army, and they are well aware of such deceptive tactics. (3) The possibility is greater. If peace fails, the Communist army will only encounter unexpected setbacks. Looking at history from near and far, like Liang Hongyu defeating Jin Wuzhu, like Bai Chongxi defeating Sun Chuanfang, they are the best lessons from the past.

The Nanjing-Shanghai area is the political and economic center of the country, and its position is even more important than Beijing and Shenyang. If the Communist army were to obtain it, it would undoubtedly change the international situation. The National Army is of course very clear about this and is determined to defend this area. Now, on the 1,500+ kilometer-long coastal defense line between Nanjing and Shanghai, in addition to the strong security teams of Jiangsu Province, there are more than a dozen armies scattered there, garrisoning Nanjing and Shanghai, trying their best to control the bridgeheads north of the river. In the river, the Second Fleet of the Navy is defending, and there are large squadrons from the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea in charge of air defense. South of the Yangtze River, there are coastal defense sentry posts and surveillance posts monitoring. With such river defenses, although it is not a natural barrier, it can be said to be as solid as a rock.

In Jiangsu Province, the river surface is relatively narrow in Yizheng and Jiangyin. On the Yizheng riverside, firing cannons would threaten the vehicles on the Nanjing-Shanghai Road, but the National Army is still firmly defending Yizheng City. The Communist army has attacked fiercely several times but has not succeeded. In Jiangyin, more than a dozen wooden boats of the Communist army attempted to cross stealthily a month ago but were repelled by the navy. However, the terrain in these two places is poor, and the National Army has deployed heavy troops for defense. Shijiaqiao and Guazhou can shell Zhenjiang, but the garrison is firmly defending these positions. The Guazhou and Liuxu positions are strong, and there is no problem with defense.

According to statistics, the strength of the Communist army in northern Jiangsu, including local Communists, is about 400,000, and they are actively building wooden oar boats in large quantities in Yancheng, Gaoyou Lake, and Hongze Lake, having built more than 1,800 boats and equipped them with instruments and motors. The momentum is vast, and it seems that they are approaching the capital directly, but this is just a show of force. In fact, the Communist army's real direction does not show any signs of crossing the river in Jiangsu. This is just a feigned attack to coordinate and contain, attempting to shake the hearts of the people in southern Jiangsu.

### Finance Minister Xu Discusses with the Stabilization Fund Yesterday to Stabilize Shanghai's Financial Problems. No Concrete Decision Has Been Made, so the Contents Are Temporarily Not Disclosed.

Minister of Finance Xu Kan and Governor of the Central Bank Liu Gongyun continued their discussions at the Bank of China yesterday morning. Members of the Gold and Silver Stabilization Fund, including Xi Demao, Li Daonan, and Lin Chongyong, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, also participated in the meeting. They dispersed at noon. After the meeting, personnel from the area said that there had been no concrete decision, so they were unwilling to make any statement. The establishment of a public market for gold and silver, the technology for selling silver coins, and the brokers and organization of the gold and silver market are all issues of great concern to all parties. Reporters from various newspapers inquired with the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, but Mr. Lin was also unwilling to disclose anything. He only said that whether or not to sell is related to his work and cannot be told. Reporters repeatedly asked that since gold has a fixed price, silver dollars should also have a price. Mr. Lin replied that he did not know. However, it is generally speculated that the Central Bank will sell silver coins in large quantities after the official establishment of the gold and silver market. The establishment of the market will make it easier for the Central Bank to control gold and silver prices. Yesterday, the gold trading price had already fallen by 10% of the fixed price.

Yesterday, the National Bank continued to sell large quantities of gold and sugar to control the rise in prices. Today, in order to prevent price increases before and after the release of the cost of living index, the National Bank has decided to continue selling large quantities. At 10 AM yesterday, the Gold and Silver Stabilization Fund held a meeting at the Bank of China. Liu Gongyun, Xi Demao, Li Daonan, Chen Changtong, and Lin Chongyong all attended. During the meeting, the success or failure of the Shanghai sales policy was reviewed in detail. It was decided to continue using the policy this week to strike at illegal speculation and profiteering and rising prices.

### Money Market Fluctuates, Secret Interest Rates Around 100 Yuan

[Our newspaper's dispatch] Yesterday's money market fluctuated uncertainly, entirely dependent on whether or not the National Bank sells various goods. The money market at the beginning of the day continued the tightness of the weekend, with day loans still standing at 110 yuan to 130 yuan. Subsequently, various industries saw the price charts and were attracted by the high day loan rates, so they sold goods to seek funds for lending, so the supply of funds gradually became abundant, and day loans also retreated to 80 yuan to 100 yuan. Near noon, most of the funds were settled, and the National Bank suddenly sold gold again. The market, fearing the repetition of last week's mistakes, did not want to fall again and did not absorb much. However, day loan rates began to rise again. Around 2-3 PM in the afternoon, they rose to 130 yuan again. However, it was finally learned that there were not many sales and the funds were limited, while disbursements from the national treasury and remittances from other ports continued to flow out, and day loan rates finally retreated to the 90 yuan-100 yuan range. Yesterday, national banks and bureaus had a shortfall of 12 trillion yuan due to the settlement of cloth and sugar from the weekend. Foreign firms had a shortfall of 70 million yuan, large clearing houses had a shortfall of more than 2 billion yuan, and small clearing houses had a surplus of 3.27 billion yuan.

Recently, the high level of secret interest rates in the market is quite alarming. On average, it is believed that secret interest rates are high every day, which not only proves the current state of inflation but also stimulates price increases. An executive of a money shop made a detailed calculation: based on a day loan rate of 50 yuan per 1,000 yuan, if 10,000 yuan is loaned out today, in five months, with principal and interest, 12.4 million yuan can be obtained. In the first month, 10,000 yuan plus interest can become 40,000 yuan. In the second month, adding interest again can become 160,000 yuan. In the third month, adding interest again can become 640,000 yuan. In the fourth month, adding interest again can become 2.56 million yuan. In the fifth month, adding interest again can become 12.4 million yuan. This loan interest rate is much higher than before the war. It is heard that the Financial Management Bureau is currently trying to prepare to curb and improve the situation.

### Gold Merchants Resuming Business Registration, Guild is Rushing to Handle

Likely Cannot Be Completed This Week

[Our newspaper's dispatch] According to the situation of preparations in various aspects, the establishment of a public gold and silver market in this city will have to be extended to the end of this week or the beginning of next week before there is any sign of progress. The Gold Businessmen's Guild continued to handle the resumption of business registration for members yesterday. More than 60 old members have gone to collect application forms, but none have been filled out and submitted yet. In order to have further discussions, the guild plans to hold another meeting of directors and supervisors at 3 PM today to complete the necessary preparations for the eve of the resumption of business. According to a spokesperson of the guild, the resumption of business by the guild members this time, according to the order of the Ministry of Finance, refers to the original members, so new members are not being considered for the time being. Judging from the current situation of members applying for registration, it is too early to say that the resumption of business can be completed within a week.

Financial authorities also hope that the deadline for the establishment of the gold and silver market can be realized within this week. However, it is reported that this still depends on the extent of the guild's preparations. As for whether the Central Bank will sell newly minted silver dollars on the market, it is impossible to give a definite answer due to the confidential nature of the matter.

### Customs Yuan Converted to Foreign Currency

Calculated According to the Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificate. The National Bank Does Not Issue Customs Yuan Notes Separately.

The implementation of customs duties in Customs Yuan has been ordered by the Jianghai Customs in this city and began to be implemented yesterday morning. The Customs Commissioner summoned the relevant departments and responsible workers yesterday morning to discuss the techniques and procedures for implementation. According to the person in charge of the customs, all preparations for the customs to collect customs duties in Customs Yuan have been completed. When goods are imported and declared, the customs will determine the amount of customs duties to be paid. Then, the importer will directly pay the money to the Tax Collection Office of the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank. The customs itself will not directly collect taxes. It is expected that customs revenue will increase sharply after implementation.

According to news from the Central Bank, the exchange rate between the Customs Yuan and gold, silver dollars, gold yuan, US dollars, and Hong Kong dollars has been determined by the National Bank and is generally calculated according to the Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificate price. One Customs Yuan is equivalent to 40 US cents. 50 US dollars is equivalent to one tael of gold, which is equivalent to 125 Customs Yuan, equivalent to one tael of gold. The National Bank does not issue Customs Yuan banknotes separately.

### Circle Inside Money Market Still Buoyant, Chinese Stocks Plunge All the Way Down

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Chinese stock market yesterday first showed a flat trend before weakening, with a period of stability in the middle. Near noon, frequent negative news from outside the circle made people feel insecure, and the market showed signs of not being able to hold up. Early in the morning, news was heard that the money supply was initially reported to be easing, with unofficial interest rates outside the market opening at 80 to 85 yuan. The central bank's allocation price remained at the original level. With the impending release of the cost-of-living index, the market slightly increased due to the consideration of buying more at cheaper prices. Near noon, news spread that the central bank was still dumping gold in large quantities, causing gold prices outside the circle to plummet. Various markets all rebounded near closing, while the money supply felt tight, and the market went all the way down. Yong'an Cotton Yarn opened at 5.65 in the morning. After opening, short positions covered, and more scattered buyers absorbed the supply, pushing the price up to 5.75 at one point. Securities firms assisted in selling, causing it to drop again to 5.57. Financial and yarn firms then absorbed the supply again, raising it to 5.75. Subsequently, the price fluctuated around this level, with no clear winner or loser. By 11:30 am, the market price of gold gradually declined, quickly retreating near the 300,000 mark. Cotton yarn advanced and retreated rapidly, causing a soft trend to emerge, and the market went all the way down, with bids retreating to 5.45. After the low, the money supply became extremely tight, and there was still active selling in the market, causing a slight rebound to 5.40 yuan. The market ultimately closed at 5.225 yuan.

Small and medium-sized stocks opened relatively flat. After opening, they slightly increased before quickly declining. Near noon, they all closed at lower prices. Meyer opened at 1.60 yuan, rose to 1.67 yuan, fell to 1.38 yuan, and closed at 1.43 yuan at noon. Xinhua, Jingfu, Qinxing, Zhonghua Fire, and China Porcelain all opened slightly higher before closing lower at noon. The remaining stocks were all weak, with a total transaction volume of 3,185,336,000 shares.

Yesterday, the foreign stock market was weak due to lackluster news. Jardine Matheson was bid at 10,009 yuan and 11,001 yuan. Asia was bid at 1,050 yuan and 1,070 yuan. Wheelock Marden had sellers at 32,000 yuan. British American Tobacco had buyers at 12,000. The remaining stocks were quiet.

Trading in gold bonds was sparse, with both bulls and bears showing little interest. Prices slightly increased, opening at 175,000 yuan in the morning and rising to 177,800 yuan later, closing at 180,000 yuan at noon, and remaining at 180,000 yuan in the afternoon.

### Market Stroll: Spectators

The Central Bank's Confidence: Playing It Stronger and Stronger; Giving Gold Bonds a Boost

In the recent week or two, the speculative market seems to have become the financial authorities' pliable tool, allowing them to dictate its ups and downs.

The big fish eat the small fish, which is the law of nature. In the market, whoever has the bigger capital is the winner. With the central bank's printing presses, they have an inexhaustible source of capital. As long as they are willing, what can't they do?

Therefore, the financial authorities have recently been able to dictate the market's movements, making others go long or short as they please. Thinking about the principle of the big fish eating the small fish, it's not surprising at all. What's surprising is why they were helpless in the past. Could it be a difference in intelligence? Only heaven knows.

It seems that the financial authorities are also very confident in controlling the market. Therefore, they are playing it more and more boldly. Last week, it was widely rumored that the gold and silver markets could reopen this week. Although the rumors came a bit early, they are indeed true. Not only are they true, but the authorities' eagerness is even more urgent than the speculative friends who are interested in it. This shows that the financial authorities' confidence is getting stronger day by day.

However, in my opinion, the market's sluggishness in the past week was due to the natural trend of the mid-month situation. The real test of their power should be the control forces in the coming week.

It's one thing not to talk about the gold and silver markets, but once you mention them, it feels incredibly wonderful.

Everyone is concerned about the news of the reopening of the gold and silver markets, hoping for higher gold and silver prices in the future. In fact, everything remains the same. The reopening will not balance the market. Looking at the past, even though the authorities have shown their ability to control the market, the price increases of various goods have always kept pace with interest rates, which is very clear.

Gold and silver merchants are excited about the permission to reopen the gold and silver markets. However, they are all hesitant about the issue of security deposits. It is said that each person must pay 100 gold bars. This amount was not considered large before the war, but it is not small now. Moreover, if merchants pay physical goods to the authorities as security deposits, what guarantee can the authorities give to the merchants? Some people have suggested that the market be responsible for safekeeping the security deposits itself, but the market authorities do not have a safe place to store gold, and no one dares to take on this responsibility.

In fact, the authorities' eagerness to open the gold and silver markets early has other intentions. Because they know that it is difficult for merchants to pay physical goods as security deposits, they still want to maintain the standard of 100 gold bars per person to leave room for bargaining. In the future, it is very likely that the security deposit will remain at 100 gold bars per person, with no concessions. However, the condition of paying physical goods may be changed to paying gold bonds. The market price of gold bonds is half the price of physical gold, which is equivalent to reducing the security deposit by half. Wouldn't this give gold bonds a boost for the merchants?

### Gold Prices Slightly Rebound Near Noon Amid Central Bank Sales

The gold market yesterday was still soft, with the central bank continuing to dump gold, disheartening the bulls. The initial price opened at 333,000, 338,000, then rose to 340,000, 345,000. Afterwards, it fluctuated around 335,000. Near noon, the central bank sold again, causing extreme fear. There was frequent selling, and short sellers followed, causing the market to rebound. The price fell to the edge of 300,000. After the low, the money supply became very tight, with underground interest rates reaching 125 yuan to 140 yuan. The floating longs could not bear the burden, and selling continued. The market closed at 295,000 yuan to 300,000 yuan at noon. The futures market opened at 325,000, 330,000, then rose to around 330,000 in the mid-session. After 3 pm, it rose to around 335,000. At 4 pm, it rose to 341,000.

### Tight Credit, Stagnant Sales, Rice Prices Slightly Weaken, Flour Prices Decline, Oil Market Fluctuates

Rice prices showed a downward trend due to tight credit. Sellers were eager to sell because of high underground interest rates, while rice shops were reluctant to buy. Sellers initially wanted to maintain the original price, but ultimately lowered it due to sluggish sales. The North Market's white japonica and thin indica rice were priced at 36,500 yuan, a decrease of 500 yuan from last Saturday. Premium japonica rice remained at 39,000 yuan. In the South Market, japonica and indica rice each decreased by 500 yuan, but the market remained stagnant until closing, and prices continued to fall. The total amount of rice arriving at the two markets was 73,333 shi.

Edible oil prices fluctuated erratically. Due to tight credit, prices fell early in the morning. They briefly struggled to rebound, but ultimately declined due to reported losses from outside the industry at closing. Soybean oil opened at 142,000 yuan, briefly rose to 148,000 yuan in the mid-session, but returned to 143,000 yuan at closing, a decrease of 4,000 yuan. Crude rapeseed oil closed at 138,000 yuan, a decrease of 5,000 yuan. Jilong crude oil fell by 9,000 yuan. Sesame oil and tea oil each fell by 10,000 yuan. Soybean cake fell by 1,000 yuan.

With tight credit, the number of buyers of flour decreased sharply, and prices declined. Sellers from the north began to sell at the opening, followed by factories. Old chariot flour opened at 15,300 yuan and fell to 15,150 yuan at closing. The price ultimately fell to 15,000 yuan due to the decline in gold prices, a decrease of 650 yuan from last Saturday morning. Battleship flour ultimately fell to 14,400 yuan, and Red Bee, Jiancheng, and others each fell by 600 to 700 yuan. Bran was sluggish and had no outlet.

Miscellaneous grains all trended downward. With tight credit, there were more sellers than buyers. Both factory and customer appetites for soybeans were maintained, and the price fell by 2,000 yuan. Raw peanuts fell by 5,000 yuan. Corn and red sorghum each fell by 1,000 yuan. Sesame also fell by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan due to the oil factories' lack of demand.

### Promissory Notes in Circulation, Financial Authorities to Investigate

The circulation of promissory notes among merchant associations has recently become very popular. This has had a significant impact on credit expansion. In light of this, the financial authorities previously advised various merchant associations to reduce the issuance of such notes to avoid affecting the market and to facilitate the associations' own operations. It is now known that some small and medium-sized merchant associations have largely paid lip service to this advice in order to please their clients. The financial authorities are paying close attention to this matter. It is reported that a centralized investigation will be conducted to effectively tighten credit and stabilize the market.

### Imported Overseas Orders Decline Compared to Previous Week

According to the Import Management Committee, a total of 90 import applications for overseas orders that have been paid for were received in the first week of this month, totaling over 420,000 U.S. dollars, a decrease of one-third compared to the previous week. The method of applying for import of these overseas orders has been in place for 18 weeks, and a total of 1,664 import applications have been approved, totaling 1,138,232 U.S. dollars.

Tea Market Stable and Firm

The tea market's rising trend has continued unabated since its rapid advance. This is due to the scarcity of tea stocks, which has stirred up people's emotions. At the same time, the market continues to build on the latent strength from last week's prices, which were still considered insufficient. Therefore, sellers immediately shouted for higher prices at the opening, and the market rose sharply. The trend briefly stabilized in the middle due to the tightness of funds in the industry. However, the market showed no signs of instability and remained firm as before. Internal sales of tea were mainly from shops in this area, with some additions. However, sales in Suzhou, Wuxi, and rural areas were sluggish due to rain. As for exports of boxed tea, the rapid increase in prices has gradually caused them to be higher than foreign tea prices, causing demand to weaken and trade to be minimal.

Tung Oil Declines

The tung oil market, which had been advancing towards new peaks, completely changed its appearance yesterday after the opening, frequently trending downward. This was because the pressure from the authorities' sale of materials and tightening of credit had gradually affected the industry. Sellers suddenly began to sell in large numbers, and buyers took the opportunity to suppress prices, causing the market to retreat. By closing, prices had fallen by more than 10,000 yuan compared to the previous week, but trading was still active.

### Cigarettes and Soap Market Flat and Weak

Yesterday morning, the cigarette market was cautious due to the continued tight credit situation, and sellers slightly loosened their grip. However, actual sales from shops were still strong, and the market rebounded. At closing, Yizhong's high-end cigarettes were slightly firm, while the rest were flat. Large daily necessities merchants lacked the strength to raise prices, and all parties remained on the sidelines. The market was flat and weak. Gu Ben was at 55,000 yuan, Jian Dao at 50,000 yuan, Xiang Mao at 35,400 yuan, Mei Li matches at 230,000 yuan, and Fenghuang matches at 220,000 yuan.

### Yarn Prices Fall, Cotton Cloth Sales Become More Severe

Cotton yarn lacked the strength to rise. The market opened with a firm sentiment, and high prices were quoted for various yarns. Subsequently, the tight credit situation in the market continued, and the prices of goods outside the circle were all flat and weak. Actual sales were also sluggish, and trading in the market was very quiet. Sellers were unwilling to hold on and were generally trying to sell their goods for cash. However, new buyers were reluctant to step forward, and the market gradually declined.

42-count Blue Phoenix fell from 2,720,000 yuan all the way to 2,510,000 yuan at closing, a decrease of 60,000 yuan compared to the weekend. 140-count Blue Phoenix was down 70,000 yuan, and 32-count Silver Moon also decreased by 60,000 yuan, closing at 1,640,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse spot goods opened at 1,310,000 yuan and briefly rose to 1,360,000 yuan. However, due to scattered shorts and Guangdong merchants being forced to cover their positions, there were many hedging sales, ultimately closing at 1,220,000 yuan, a decrease of 50,000 yuan. Factory orders ultimately traded at 2,215,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse slightly decreased by 20,000 yuan. The sales of the remaining 16-count and 10-count coarse yarns were also sluggish, and market prices followed the decline.

The cloth market rose and fell. Due to the tight credit situation in the industry, trading in the market was quiet. Business in the street shops was dismal. Only a few merchants from Guangdong and Hubei made small purchases. Scattered shorts, pressured by high interest rates, sold off their positions. Various cloth prices slightly increased after the high, resulting in a slight increase. Longtou fine cloth opened at 49,200 yuan and briefly rose to 51,600 yuan, but soon retreated and ultimately closed at 48,800 yuan, an increase of 2,300 yuan compared to the weekend. Laba Tong fine cloth increased by 2,200 yuan. Sijunzi yuan bieji opened at 47,500 yuan, with the highest price reaching 48,500 yuan in the middle. Near noon, scattered shorts flooded the market, and the selling pressure was strong, causing the market to quickly turn downward, ultimately closing at 46,400 yuan, an increase of 1,500 yuan.

Other Sijunzi yuan zhigong and Yao Li yuan guangxie also showed slight gains. State-owned factories generally increased their opening prices by about 50% compared to Saturday. 190 high-end Shilin broke through the 100,000 yuan mark.

### Silk Market Weak

The raw silk market dropped sharply yesterday. The credit in the market was still buoyant, and the shadow interest was high and then low, with people's minds weakened. No. 120 Dongyang immediate futures opened at 1,710,000, and the market lifted it, once reaching 1,760,000. When it came to the close, I heard that gold had plummeted, and people's minds were weak. At noon, the current day's position was as small as 1,620,000, and the next day's position was 1,765,000, small 100,000 yuan.

Raw silk was initially slightly stronger in the morning because the credit was slightly looser and the foreign exchange certificate opened higher in the morning. The high-end Linyong initially shouted 265 yuan, and at noon, the gold price outside the circle plummeted, the positions were all tight, and the shadow interest rate was raised. The market was constantly selling, and the market rebounded slightly, eventually closing at 2,500,000.

The silk market was initially seen as strong yesterday because the credit was slightly relaxed. Meyer's opening was lifted because the chips in the market were still small, and the opening was shouted at 1,185,000 yuan. Later, it rose 30,000 yuan, and then fell back at noon, eventually closing at 1,165,000 yuan.

### Keelung Coal Prices Adjusted Again

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the Taiwan exchange rate was adjusted to one to six, the Keelung coal price of the Four Mines Joint Venture was adjusted to 92,830 yuan yesterday, an increase of 9,610 yuan compared to the previous price. The prices of other white coal, lumps, and debris remained unchanged.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Alice Park, managed by Baohe Foreign Company, carrying 5,469 tons of coal from Norfolk, USA, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 6 pm yesterday.

In addition, the tanker Di Roma, represented by Taikoo Company, carrying 11,000 tons of diesel from Murray, is scheduled to arrive at 6 pm yesterday. However, neither of the above two ships was seen in Shanghai at 6 pm yesterday. It is likely due to bad weather, and it is expected that they will arrive in Shanghai this morning.

### How to Rationalize Import and Export Trade: Import and Export Merchants Association Expresses Opinions on Financial and Economic Proposals

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the announcement of the financial and economic reform plan, the reporter has repeatedly visited the person in charge of the local Import and Export Commercial Association to ask for opinions. According to the report yesterday, the opinions on the part of the plan related to import and export trade are as follows:

More than half a month has passed since the government announced the financial and economic reform plan, and the detailed rules for implementation have not yet been announced. These detailed rules for implementation are the specific methods for promoting this plan, and all parties are extremely eager to see them. Here are some views on the part of the plan related to import and export trade, for the reference of the authorities in formulating the detailed rules for implementation or revising the plan.

First of all, the possible effects of the plan on import and export trade can be divided into positive and negative aspects. In terms of positive effects, the authorities' import and export trade may be able to operate flexibly. That is, after the implementation of the plan, (1) due to the reduction in the types of goods for import quota allocation, huge institutions such as the Import and Export Management Committee can be abolished. Moreover, after being approved by the Supervisory Yuan and requested by the Executive Yuan, importers can reduce various roundabout procedures such as applying for permits and visas, which will facilitate the import trade. And due to the exemption of visa procedures, the cost of visa fees can be reduced, which will reduce the cost of imported goods. This is especially beneficial to the industrial streets. (2) Due to the abolition of the restrictions of Central Bank Notice No. 170, the regulations stipulate that foreign exchange transfer certificates can be freely transferred in order to import goods from abroad, which will make the price of transfer certificates close to the actual situation, and may have a positive effect on export trade. At present, the foreign exchange required for import relies solely on export foreign exchange, so what is beneficial to export is a beneficial factor for import.

As for the possible side effects of the plan on import and export trade, that is, the negative effects, there are the following two items. That is, (1) due to the conversion of customs import duties to customs yuan, smuggling in South China will inevitably increase, and in fact, the new situation of smuggling in South China is already in the process of forming. After the implementation of the plan, except for a small number of restricted, prohibited, or temporarily suspended imported goods, the rest can be freely imported. However, due to the conversion of customs import duties to customs yuan, goods that can be freely imported will also be smuggled in order to reduce import costs. Moreover, due to the increasing trend of smuggling in South China, the financial purpose expected by the plan, hoping to increase fiscal revenue by converting to customs yuan, will inevitably be difficult to achieve due to the reduction of formal imports. What's more, the economic situation in Central China is rigid, and imports will be difficult to increase. (2) Due to the opening of imports, the production of various related industries in the country may be adversely affected. However, this shortcoming may be compensated. That is, generally speaking, future imported goods may be divided into (A) goods allowed to be freely imported, (B) goods temporarily not allowed to be imported, and (C) goods prohibited from being imported. In order to compensate for the above shortcomings, it is hoped that goods allowed to be freely imported can be slightly stricter. And it is hoped that more goods can be listed as temporarily not allowed to be imported in order to achieve the effect of protection.

Finally, regarding the import and export trade part of the plan, food, cotton, and fertilizers are listed, and the government will formulate separate measures for handling them. It is hoped that detailed and more reasonable measures can be announced in the near future. And it is hoped that the use of free funds will be allowed for import. As for the export of yarn, it is also hoped that restrictions can be relaxed. It is also hoped that the overstaffed institutions such as the Cotton Yarn Export Committee and the US-aided Cotton Yarn Joint Purchasing and Sales Office can be abolished. In addition, after the huge institutions such as the Import and Export Management Committee are abolished, it is hoped that a reasonable institution for coordinating import and export trade decision-making can be established, and that industrialists and businessmen can be allowed to participate.

### Exciting Basketball Tonight: Ren Yu Reunited with Encars, Hai Qing to Battle Pfeiffer Again

[Report from Our Newspaper] There will be exciting games in the basketball league tonight. Ren Yu, which has risen to second place in the league, will meet Encars on a narrow road. The outcome of this battle will have a significant impact on Ren Yu's future. Ren Yu's basketball skills are improving rapidly, and Encars has also made great progress in the second round. This will undoubtedly be a wonderful game. In another Group A1 game, Pfeiffer and Hai Qing, two American teams, will compete for a barrier. The opening game in Group A2 will be Movie Star vs. Mao Xun. Ticket prices remain the same, listed below:

You Yi vs. Mao Xun (Group A2) 5:30 pm

Pfeiffer vs. Hai Qing (Group A1) 6:30 pm

Ren Yu vs. Encars (Group A1) 7:30 pm

The Final Showdown: Ren Yu Reunites with Encars According to Group A1, there are four Chinese teams and four Western teams. Recently, among the Chinese teams, only Hua Lian has suffered one setback and has the greatest hope of winning the championship. Hui Li and Hu Jing have both lost four times, tied with Encars. Ren Yu, on the other hand, has won six and lost two games, showing great momentum. Winning tonight would solidify their second place. Otherwise, Encars will surpass Hui Li and Hu Jing and approach them directly. Ren Yu has achieved brilliant results in this competition, thanks to the combined training and guidance of the coach. Xu Zhongyi has returned from overseas, and Cai Jindian has joined to assist Chen, strengthening the team's strength and improving their basketball skills. Encars was originally a giant among Western teams in Shanghai, but their results in the first round were mixed. In the second round, they made great efforts, and Hui Li and Hu Jing suffered at their hands, and their old enemies were avenged. Although the team leader Engeney has left Shanghai, the meteorology team leader Bo Shou Shengge has been promoted to join the battle. Bo Tou is extremely brave, and between Burton, Peng Qigu Fu, he is like a tiger with wings, making people feel afraid. Ren Yu was humiliated in the first round and has endured it until now. Now that they are reunited on a narrow road, how can they be willing to give in? Moreover, it is related to their future. The heroes of the two teams will show their skills and fight to the death. Let's see who will win and who will lose.

The opening game is You Yi vs. Mao Xun, and the latter has a good chance of winning. You Yi is composed of movie stars, and they are not as good under the stage lights as they are under the mercury lights. Since their debut, they have lost both of their two games. Tonight, they will meet Mao Xun, a perennial winner in the group, which has good players such as Zhuo Guanzheng and Sun Jiawen. The rest of the players are also brave and good at fighting. However, soldiers are afraid of pride. Mao Xun will not take the enemy lightly, and winning three games in a row is a matter of course.

The next game is Pfeiffer vs. Hai Qing again. When the two teams met for the first time, Pfeiffer lost by one point with a score of 42 to 43. This is their chance to take revenge, and they will do their best. The team has never won in the first round, but the situation has changed greatly in the second round. They defeated Hua Lian and broke Maylings, avenging two old enemies. The team is also playing better and better, with Keller and Montenegro playing at their best, and the black charcoal Brown is accurate in shooting, making him a dangerous person. Hai Qing was lucky to win last time, and they will try to defeat their strong enemy again to maintain their reputation. However, the team has already lost three times in the second round, and their morale has been stimulated. A bloody battle is inevitable tonight.

### Sports World Basketball League Division One: Four Chinese Teams Still Leading

[Report from our newspaper] In the Division One basketball league, the four Chinese teams are still in the lead, followed by the four foreign teams. Although Wah Luen suffered one defeat, they still lead the pack. Yan Yee has risen to second place. Because Ernest has won consecutively in the second round, while Shanghai Police has not been as successful, Hweili, Shanghai Police, and Ernest are now tied for third, each with five wins and four losses. McKinnons and Hai Ching are improving with each game. The outcome of the second round is still uncertain. The win-loss situation of each team is listed below:

Division One Standings

Shanghai Police 9 5 .555

Ernest 9 5 .555

Pellifel 8 2 .250

### Development of English Football in the United States

[Reuters, New York, 11th] According to Barriskill, a spokesperson for the United States Football Association: Football has been quite popular in the United States recently. This summer, British professional football teams will come to England to participate in competitions. While stationed in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, American soldiers will compete with local English football teams and gain good experience. When they return to their country, they will have become good football players. Currently, there are more than 50,000 players in the United States who have joined the Football Association. Every Saturday, more than 40,000 people watch football in New York. From last September to this June, there were more than 200 teams participating in football matches in the United States. The future of football as a sport is very promising in the United States.

### British Sports Emphasize Business Acumen

[British Information Service] Sports will make a significant contribution to the British economy in 1949. Many British factories are now manufacturing many kinds of excellent sports equipment, and only one-third of them are supplied for domestic needs. Although this quantity has increased a lot compared with the domestic supply ratio a year ago, it is still far from the domestic demand before the Second World War. However, the balance of supply and demand is gradually developing. At present, fabrics and leather are still scarce in the domestic market because most of these goods are completely used for export.

The British horse racing habit can also be regarded as an export business. Foreign horse breeders' respect for British horse breeds is increasing. This can be seen from the demand for purebred horses in all aspects. Since the end of the war, this demand has not only not decreased but is increasing. British horse racing celebrity Lord Rosebery believes that this demand will not diminish. He firmly believes in the purity of British horse breeds, and his opinion has given horse breeders a new incentive to increase exports.

The British sporting spirit is also a major "export commodity." We can clearly see this from the World Games in London last summer. Every program in the World Games has a strong attraction for overseas audiences. University rowing competitions, England-Scotland football matches, tennis matches held at Wembley Stadium, and outdoor golf leagues all fascinated tens of thousands of travelers to Britain last year. These many sports programs constitute an unforgettable picture of British customs. The sports season this year is coming again, and those who come to visit again this year can enjoy it again.

Many foreign tourists will come to Britain for their first trip. They will be able to visit the British Industrial Exhibition held in London and Birmingham in May. In last year's exhibition, sports equipment occupied an important and quite eye-catching part. Many of the exhibits were not seen in British stores after the Second World War. These things are exquisitely made and are completely exported. British sports enthusiasts will be able to buy them only after a few months. This is part of Britain's self-sacrifice to increase exports. A sports equipment merchant told me after visiting last year's exhibition that when he saw so many important equipment all used for export and not sold domestically, his envy and covetousness were indescribable. The equipment made by British manufacturers is really diverse and all-encompassing, making domestic audiences feel a little overwhelmed. Sports clothing and shoes are also available in all kinds of complete sets. Of course, this year's exhibition will be no different, but there will be more new samples, and the inventory in some departments will be more sufficient for people to choose from. The quality of all kinds of goods is the most important. Although the British domestic market will benefit from the increase in production, foreign merchants will get the best quality goods. They will be able to see the best quality, excellent structure, and durability.

Sports activities will also make overseas visitors to Britain dazzled. London's football matches will be held grandly to entertain the people who come to Britain for the meeting. It is estimated that the audience for each match will reach 90,000. Other activities such as cricket will also be popular throughout the UK, so people who come to the UK in May can not worry about not having a ball game to watch. (Written by Piddington)

### Hong Kong Football News: China Motor Bus Will Compete for Second Place

[Hong Kong Air Mail] Last weekend, there were six matches in the Hong Kong First Division Football League. The results were:

South China South beat Navy Team 8-0

Eastern beat South China China 5-2

Army Team beat Air Force Team 1-0

Chinese Team beat Kitchee Team 3-2

Bus Team beat Hong Kong Club 3-2

St. Joseph's beat Police Team 5-2

It is said that South China South made its sixteenth expedition, and its power remained the same. The sailors were not good, and they received eight duck eggs, and there was no tense scene in the battle. The performance was relaxed. Not only did the people watching laugh, but the people kicking also kicked more and more happily. It can be said to be a good show of swimming dragons playing with phoenixes. It was not that South China South played well, but that the Navy performed particularly badly. South China South's forwards kicked out eight people, how could the Navy's defenders cope? A white boundary line was drawn into two battlefields. On this side, "Liang De" had few cars and horses in front of the goal. In the 70-minute game, only five people officially received the ball. Kam Hung guarded the center road, with the heroic demeanor of Yi De guarding Changban Bridge in those years. The sailors could not enter at all. Hou Zi and Shu Ling guarded the two bridgeheads, like iron walls, allowing Liu Song to often perform the heroic act of running horses and shooting money. On that side, Pei Lie fumbled and messed up. Gan Huali and Duosha were busy with business. In the first half, they still had the work of resisting, and they only lost two goals. In the second half, the entire army was wiped out, and half a dozen eggs were scored, which made the audience smile.

In the battle between the rookie South China and Eastern, because Qu Zhixian was absent and Li Shiqing fell ill at Dumu Pass, the team was pieced together temporarily, which was very abnormal, and eventually lost 2-5.

On Sunday, the two major highlights were that the Bus Team won against the Hong Kong Club, and the Chinese Team luckily defeated the Kitchee Team. The scores were both 3-2. The competition for the league runner-up is still neck and neck. It remains to be seen next week who will win. So far, the Chinese Team has four more points than the Bus Team, but the points lost are equal. The Bus Team has played two fewer games.

The Chinese Team defeated Kitchee by 3-2. From the process, the Chinese Team won by luck, because at least two of the three goals scored by the Chinese Team were given away by Kitchee's inner guards. In the second goal of the first half, Mo Jinsong did not see clearly that there were two Chinese forwards at the same time beside him, but lightly headed the ball into his own goal, which was beyond Zhang Guanxing's expectation. In the second half, Lu Huasheng's single-handed goal was caused by the mutual mistakes of You Huaxing and Li Bingzhao.

However, the morale of the Chinese Team was high, and Kitchee's lack of Yao Zhuoran was also the main reason for this victory and defeat.

The Bus Team has already reached the edge of the runner-up. In order to win the victory, in the battle against the Hong Kong Club, all the elite were sent to the field. Tan Junqian did not come because of something, and Sun Binan put on his battle clothes again after the B group game, which can be regarded as responsible. He saved a penalty kick, which made the Hong Kong Club unable to take the lead and greatly affected the morale of the army. The front line Li Chunfa and Qian Chihui were out of shape, otherwise they could have won two more goals. Deng Yijie forgot to bring his shooting shoes, and his requests were not answered. Zou Wenzhi and Li Dahui were heroes, one goal each. The central defense line Kong Qingyu and Deng Sen performed at a high level. The pair of defenders Tan Zhenhui and Mai Linfu were not top-notch, and there were loopholes everywhere, which was the Bus Team's hidden danger. Hong Kong Club's defense and offense were balanced. Chia Neng was the soul of the whole team, giving the Bus Team a lot of threats. Hua Liu was still qualified to guard the middle road. The goalkeeper was "Huang Maozai" Jia Dang, who was extraordinary yesterday and saved many dangerous balls, but Hua Liu's penalty kick failed, and Xiao Fula made an "own goal" once. The 3-2 loss was a bit wronged.

In the battle between St. Joseph's and the Police, St. Joseph's did not come because Gomes was absent, and Xu Jingcheng was injured and retired. Moreover, only nine people were enough to play at the beginning of the game, and later barely made up the number of people. It was generally believed that the Police could win this battle, but unexpectedly, the Police's performance was not satisfactory, and Joseph's, however, fought with mourning soldiers and won 5-2, which was beyond everyone's expectations.

### Thoughts on Haircuts

— Martin

Since the cost of a haircut exceeded the 1,000 yuan mark, I often don't dare to step into the barber shop when I touch my pocket. After procrastinating for several weeks, yesterday, my hair was so long that it was too unsightly, so I had no choice but to go in. Fortunately, it is a well-known and correct thing for men to be afraid of haircuts, and it is not necessarily all because they cannot afford the money; so when I sat down on the barber chair with this long hair, I was not ashamed.

Once I sat down, hypnotized by the buzzing sound of the electric hair dryer around me, I couldn't help but start daydreaming:

The profession of barber has always been quite enviable, because there are fans in summer and stoves in winter, and there is no suffering from the scorching sun or wind and rain. Moreover, both hands have to kiss the tender face and neck of a beautiful woman, and the other party will never get angry, which is still the rest. But I think the dignity of the barber is not in this; but in the mood when you lie down and let him sharpen his knife, shave your face and beard, and your power to live or die is tied to his one thought. I often think, what if this barber has a slight mental problem and is occasionally confused and cuts off the trachea with a knife, wouldn't it be over? Although such things do not happen often, it is still very dangerous that one's life is only tied to his one thought. I don't know how people like Hitler, who prevent assassination, are strictly guarded everywhere, with detectives everywhere, will deal with this haircut; I think his royal barber must be very confidant, or his brother-in-law, one unknown. In Chinese history, there have indeed been times when barbers wielded the power of life and death. Not to mention the distant past, as in the near past, when the Manchu Qing entered the customs, in order to force people to shave their long hair and change to barbarian costumes, the barbers were封ed as "waiting edicts" of the palace. When they saw old or young people with long hair on the street, they could be forced to shave it, otherwise? "Keep your head but not your hair, keep your hair but not your head." Its prestige can be imagined.

Even in foreign countries, although there is no news of killing heads by imperial decree, it is well-documented that barbers used to be surgeons. The rotating red and blue cylinder in front of the barber shop is said to have originated in Huanzhou, probably Italy, because there is no book at hand and cannot be checked. In short, at that time, people generally believed that if there was a problem, as long as a blood vessel was cut and a little blood was released, the poison would come out and the disease would be cured; the meaning is the same as that of the old people in the Chinese countryside today who have a fever, as long as someone scratches red marks on their necks, they will be fine. In Italy, the work of cutting blood vessels was done by barbers. The red and blue stripes on the cylinder, red represent arteries and blue represent veins, etc. Since blood vessels can be cut open, can't the throat be cut off? Thinking of this, one can't help but feel terrified.

Therefore, I admire the courage of those who are willing to go to the barber shop often. In the past, in the Qing Dynasty, when sentencing prisoners, big thieves were executed, and accomplices were often beheaded together, that is, they were tied to the execution ground together, and they were not notified in advance. They saw the heads of the people next to them being砍ed off, but they were still taken back. This was used as a warning, which was said to be very effective. Then today, lying on the barber chair, seeing the bright, cold razor scraping on one's throat, wouldn't one feel the danger of being murdered at all times; and dare to enjoy it and go to be killed often, how can one not admire one's courage?

Although barbers wield the power of life and death, there is one thing that is quite regrettable. That is: his own head will also have to be handed over to someone else to shave. Tailors can make clothes for themselves, and painters can paint their own houses, but only barbers cannot do it themselves, and still have to ask other barbers for advice. From this, I also realized that those who control the lives of others, their own lives are often in the hands of others, the so-called mantis catching cicada, oriole is behind. Things in the world circulate, mostly like this, "Please see the barber, people also shave his head"!

Thinking of this, I had finished my haircut, stood up, and although I paid 1,700 yuan, I felt that I had realized a great truth, and I felt that this trip was not in vain, and I felt relieved.

### On Human Transformation

— Wang Deyun

Now, most poor public school employees and clerks are probably not so-called "fitters," so it is simply difficult to "survive." In order to "adapt to the environment" and not be eliminated by society, it seems that there is a great need for "transformation."

Of course, the brains of poor guys cannot be "transformed," which may be "innate mental retardation," so there is no need to discuss it, and it is better not to mention it. At present, what urgently needs "transformation" is the human body's eyes, mouth, stomach, and legs. Because this is really related to life, it is no small matter. If scientists can move to "transform" the minds of the poor people, then I would be extremely grateful. Now I will record my humble opinions for reference, I hope you will appreciate them:

(1) Eye transformation - it is best to transform it into a cat-like eye, so that you can see clearly at night without turning on the lights, so that you can save a sum of electricity bills. Originally, it was too extravagant for poor people to even have to use electric lighting equipment.

(2) Purpose transformation - it is best to transform it into a tube shape, and have sand filter and sterilization functions, so that you can always find drinks anytime and anywhere, even if you often drink black water from the Suzhou River, it doesn't matter. - Is tap water expensive? You can also ignore it.

(3) Stomach transformation - it is best to improve it so that you don't have to eat human food, as long as you breathe a little air, you can survive, this is of course very difficult, but I also ask scientists to help.

(4) Leg transformation - it is best to improve it so that it is stronger than the legs of the Sahara ostrich, and you can run hundreds of miles without caring, then wouldn't it be great? Then, whether the tram is charged in Guan Yuan or US dollars, it has nothing to do with me.

The above four points of "transformation" are actually "current urgent matters," which are more important than any new financial and economic policies. I hope that scientists will work together to study and find ways to improve successfully, then the common people will be fortunate.

### Utter Misfortune

A person fell into the river and was washed away by the waves. The neighbor went to tell his wife and felt very sorry for the chicken:

"Madam, I bring you very bad news. Your husband drowned."

"Ah, what! His new Parker 51 was also in his bag!"

### Snake Tamer

— Zhang Hongxiang

Mrs. Wiley is from Kansas, USA. She is a middle-aged woman with black hair, blue eyes, a slender figure, and a gentle and courteous demeanor. Her conversations often include many scientific terms, while she refers to those deadly killers—poisonous snakes—as her "little darlings." For twenty-three years, she tamed two cobras with the title of "Snake King," in addition to a rattlesnake, a bamboo viper, a small cobra, three copperhead snakes, several large pythons, and over a hundred other extremely venomous snakes. Mrs. Wiley began reading books about moths and butterflies in her teens, collecting specimens while reading. Later, she studied entomology at the University of Kansas and decided to study insect animals. In 1922, after graduating from university, she took one hundred dollars to Texas to collect specimens, but ended up bringing sixty-five rattlesnakes back to the university's museum. Later, she worked at the Minneapolis Natural History Museum for fifteen years. In 1938, she voluntarily resigned and decided to start the largest private zoo in Hollywood. Mrs. Wiley's current income comes from renting snakes to film companies and frequently holding public exhibitions with ticket sales.

Mrs. Wiley discovered that Hollywood lacked snake handling talent, so sometimes, in addition to renting out venomous snakes, she also had to play the role of snake charmer in films. Once, a film required a white cobra, but none of Mrs. Wiley's snakes were white, so she had to personally paint a layer of white paint on the snake's body. When she tamed the two large cobras, she recorded everything in her diary. On August 26th, she received the two "Snake Kings" shipped from Singapore. They were initially very aggressive, hissing, jumping up to three feet high, and biting and entangling anything they could reach. In the four days after August 30th, her diary stated: "Today, I tamed them for the first time with an eighteen-inch rubber stick." The third day, it read: "Use my bare hand to grab the cobra's tail."

September 4th: "Today, I used my bare hand to grab the female Snake Queen, pried open its mouth, and fed it with my fingers."

September 6th: "Both venomous snakes are tamed, and I can now direct their movements."

Two months later, her diary read: "This is also a very strange thing! In my experience, the most venomous and dangerous snakes in the world are the easiest to tame."

Mrs. Wiley is indeed a snake taming expert. She knows the nature, needs, and reactions of snakes. Although she is so meticulous, she has been bitten by venomous snakes several times, but each time she always blames herself because she violated her own sacred rule.

This sacred and precious rule, which seems very ordinary and commonplace on the surface, is: "Quiet, calm, never negligent, bold but precise. If an unexpected unfortunate event occurs, then immediately freeze or make a swift retreat."

### Can There Be Complete Honesty Between Husband and Wife?

— Baozhu

Sincere treatment and openness between husband and wife are great principles that have been considered appropriate throughout history and across cultures. But is it possible to be too straightforward, too honest, and without any pretense? The facts tell us "no." Here are two stories, which, although like jokes, are common occurrences:

A couple felt that there was hypocrisy between people in society, and even the closest friends were not honest enough. But there should not be this "false" character between husband and wife, so they decided that in the future, everyone should be honest about everything. One day, the husband asked his wife to personally cook him a steak. The wife was not good at cooking, but she happily spent a lot of time making a steak for her husband. The husband was very grateful, but after cutting for a long time, using all his strength, he only cut off a small piece. After taking a bite, it was so salty it was almost bitter. So he thought he should honestly tell his wife: "This steak you cooked is really too bad, it's so hard and salty, it's like a stone pulled out of a salt jar." As soon as the wife heard this, she immediately pulled a long face, snatched his plate, threw it into the kitchen, and muttered: "No one was happy to cook for you in the first place. If you want to eat well, why don't you go to a fancy restaurant?"

Another newlywed couple also agreed to tell each other the truth. The husband liked to paint, so he went to learn painting in his spare time. Not long after, he brought back a portrait to show his wife and said with a smile: "What do you think of my masterpiece?" As soon as the wife saw it, she burst out laughing: "What is this? It looks neither like a person nor like a ghost, but like a monkey." The husband was very unhappy and still unwilling after a while: "You don't understand art at all. The professor at school said I was doing well!" "I don't understand art, I'm not good enough for you," the wife immediately retorted: "Why don't you marry someone who understands art?" As a result, the two quarreled all afternoon, and the wife angrily went back to her parents' home, where she stayed for a week before being persuaded to return by her family.

Of course, I don't advocate that couples should perfunctorily deal with each other. Too much perfunctory behavior and hypocrisy will lead to a lack of true feelings. At the same time, desperately trying to imitate Europeans and Americans by always praising one's husband or wife is also not our custom. For example, if George's wife bought a bright red dress one day, wore it home, and showed it to him, the gentleman would show a very surprised look and say: "GE! Darling! You look so beautiful in this dress. Even the most beautiful female movie star in Hollywood can't compare to you." In reality, this wife weighs at least one hundred and eighty pounds.

In some places, under certain emotions, a wife or husband being slightly "fake" will only increase feelings and not cause harm. At least no wife wants her husband to call her a monster because her rouge is a little too red; nor does any husband want his wife to say he looks like a criminal because he hasn't shaved for several days.

Why do even couples need to have a little hypocrisy? The reason is very simple: because everyone is born with self-esteem, a love of beauty, a desire to excel, and a desire to be appreciated. These natural tendencies cannot be eliminated by the relationship of husband and wife, lovers, confidants, or even parents and children.
