### Director He Convenes Military Meeting Before Leaving Shanghai: Concentrate Forces to Defend Shanghai; Central Financial Institutions Determined Not to Relocate

[Central News Agency, This City] General He Yingqin, President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of National Defense, arrived in Shanghai on the 23rd. That evening, he convened a military meeting with Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief Zhou Zhirou, Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing, Garrison Commander Chen Daqing, and various generals. Director He gave detailed instructions on the deployment of concentrated national forces to defend Greater Shanghai. Yesterday morning (the 24th), He also invited Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jiyu, Yan Huiqing, Zhang Jia'ao, Gu Zhenggang, Qian Xinzhi, Liu Hongsheng, Yang Hu, Lu Jingshi, Shui Xiangyun, Xu Xueyu, Cheng Cangbo, and Luo Qinghua to discuss matters. Tang Enbo and Chen Liang also participated. Director He announced the government's utmost determination to secure Greater Shanghai. All participants were greatly excited and enthusiastically expressed their views, fully demonstrating the spirit of unity and cooperation between the government and the people in defending Greater Shanghai. He also announced that the central financial institutions in Shanghai would continue to conduct business in Shanghai to support the military and meet the needs of industry and commerce, and that rumors of relocation were absolutely untrue. Furthermore, the municipal government and local leaders will be jointly responsible for ensuring the supply of essential goods for Shanghai residents, such as food and fuel, to prevent shortages. All citizens, including government employees at all levels and all industrial and commercial personnel, should live and work in peace, and everyone should remain steadfast in their positions, working to defend Greater Shanghai. No one should use relocation or evacuation as an excuse to demand so-called emergency funds, which would create confusion and disrupt order. Shanghai citizens should consider Shanghai as their home and the place to live their lives. Since the national army is determined and confident in securing Shanghai, and there are thorough plans and preparations for the supply of essential goods, all citizens should cooperate with the government and the national army to permanently secure their own lifeline and should not create disorder, giving the enemy an opportunity. After completing his business, He flew to Guangzhou by special plane on the afternoon of the 24th, accompanied by Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Huang Shao-gu and others.

[United Press, Washington, 24th] The rapid success of the Communist army in crossing the Yangtze River has led American military experts to believe that if the Chinese Communists wish to occupy Shanghai, they can achieve this without much fighting. However, some officials speculate that the Communist army may bypass Shanghai, as occupying Shanghai would prevent American relief grain from reaching Shanghai, increasing the Communist side's burden on the food supply.

### Communist Army Enters Nanjing City: Water and Electricity Restored, Shops Still Not Open

[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] The Communist army entered Nanjing at 2:30 AM on the 24th. By dawn, 10,000 Communist soldiers had occupied the capital. Over 500,000 troops under Chen Yi began crossing the river in the evening. Order has been restored in the city. Communist soldiers patrol the streets to prevent further disorder and looting. The Maintenance Committee is discussing detailed plans for the transfer of the municipal government and other institutions with Communist liaison officers. Water and electricity have been restored, and postal and telecommunications services are operating as usual. Schools continue to hold classes, but shops are still not open. Small vegetable markets are already open for business.

[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] The Chinese Communists restored order in Nanjing on the 24th. 200,000 Communist soldiers are concentrated in Pukou, waiting for ships to cross the river. The "People's Security Maintenance Association" has received notification from the Communist side to provide sufficient ships in the next three days. On the morning of the 24th, a large number of people crowded the streets, quietly watching the Communist army enter the city. Two Communist soldiers were stationed at the Nanjing Hotel, where the "People's Security Maintenance Association" is located. The Communist soldiers sat on the ground, surrounded by a large crowd. A reporter noticed a brigade of Communist soldiers turning from Zhongshan East Road towards the east gate to take over the airport. Their equipment was similar to that of the National Army. Their yellow uniforms were unmarked, and some wore American-made steel helmets. Two regiments of Communist soldiers who entered the city were stationed at the Social Affairs Bureau and the Highway Administration Bureau, but the names of their actual headquarters and commanders were not revealed. Most of the Communist soldiers are from Jiangsu.

The Communist 35th and 28th Armies are crossing the river. The vanguard troops that have entered the city belong to the 35th Army. The Presidential Palace and the Capital Garrison Headquarters have also been garrisoned. Small teams of Communist soldiers patrol the streets from time to time. The "People's Security Maintenance Association" is discussing detailed plans for the takeover of the municipal government and other institutions with Communist liaison officers.

[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] The Communist army took over Nanjing at 3:45 AM this morning.

After entering the city, the Communist army occupied key points and took over government agencies, banks, and public utilities. The Communist army encountered no resistance upon entering the city. Early-rising citizens watched the Communist army with curiosity. After dispersing throughout the city, the Communist army sat down in groups, sang songs, and listened to lectures from officers.

The jeep in which the reporters were sitting was the first to encounter the Communist army entering the city. It was stopped by the Communist soldiers, who asked about their identities in a gentle manner. Mr. Guan of the same profession told them that he represented the French News Agency, and I also replied that I was from the American United Press. One soldier shouted "American" and shone a flashlight on my face, staring intently. They took us to an officer of the Communist army about one hundred yards away. The officer questioned us about our profession and then told us to go back. We followed the jeep that led the way. When our car fell behind, that car often waited. The driver was very sensible. We glanced at the car and saw that one person inside was more neatly dressed than the others, probably the leader of the Nanjing delegation welcoming the Communist army into the city.

### Chennault Will Make a Final Appeal: Military Aid to China to Resist the Communist Army; US Congress Investigation of China Policy Largely Determined

[United Press, New York, 23rd] The Howard newspaper group reported on the 23rd that General Chennault is returning to the US "to make a final appeal for US aid to the National Army to resist the southward advance of the Communists." The Howard newspaper Washington dispatch stated that the former Flying Tigers leader "believes it is not too late to provide effective assistance to China." Demonstrating his courageous confidence, he is willing to participate in the war himself if he can obtain the necessary aircraft. Chennault is expected to appear before congressional committees to advocate for aid to China. His views conflict with those of Major General Barr, former head of the US Military Advisory Group, who testified that the failure of the Nationalist army was not due to a lack of military equipment. Chennault believes that a small air force can restore the morale of Nationalist generals and soldiers and have an equally depressing effect on the Communists. Chennault firmly believes that China's Muslim provinces will be the center of resistance to Communist aggression. Their leaders, such as Ma Hongkui of Ningxia and Ma Bufang of Qinghai, are highly regarded in the Chinese military. Chennault believes that the mountainous areas of the west will also fight to the end. He said, "Even if the Communists can reach the southern coast along the Canton-Hankou Railway, they will still encounter determined resistance in the west." He went on to say that Japan occupied more Chinese territory in 1941 than the Communists now occupy. At that time, many people said that the situation was hopeless, but he said that time proved them wrong. He believes that US aid saved China at that time and can save it again now.

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Senator Bridges said on the 23rd that the Communist control of South China would make MacArthur's occupation of Japan "more difficult." Bridges said that a congressional investigation into US China policy seems "certain." He said that the appropriations subcommittee will insist on this investigation before allocating funds to the State Department for the 1950 fiscal year.

Editorial

### A Review of the Silver Dollar Problem

In today's hyperinflation of the gold yuan, no one trusts inconvertible paper money anymore, so silver dollars, which have been in seclusion for many years, are once again being valued. At the second conference held in this city on April 19, the focus of discussion was almost entirely on the silver dollar issue, such as the management of silver dollar trading, whether silver dollars can be used as currency, and whether prices can be based on silver dollars. At this stage, these many issues are indeed worth resolving.

Originally, the silver dollar was a currency with real value, and it has always occupied a rather important position in the monetary history of our country, so people generally have a preference for it, which is a major reason why it can be so popular today. However, the people's habit of using silver dollars did not start today. As early as the legal tender era, silver dollars had automatically become a kind of currency in the inland. At the current eve of the impending collapse of the gold yuan, if the authorities want to continue the life of the gold yuan, it would be more meaningful to officially restore the use of silver dollars.

In essence, silver dollars have become the main currency of the present, and the "Financial Reform Plan" has also recognized that it can "flow" freely, but due to the measure that "commodities must not be priced in silver dollars," it has not yet obtained the formal status of currency. This makes the status of silver dollars today even more peculiar and subtle. In fact, from the perspective of monetary science, since it is named "circulation," it is of course a tool of circulation, that is, it has acquired the status of currency. Moreover, among the various measures that have already been taken, military salaries are paid in silver dollars, the Central Bank throws silver dollars, banks receive money in silver dollars, and provincial and municipal agencies use silver dollars for income and expenditure. Since silver dollars are widely regarded as the standard unit and a substitute for large bills, there is no reason not to recognize its legal status. It should be known that today the gold yuan is constantly depreciating, and the Central Bank has lost the ability to control it. How can such a malignant degree of currency avoid being rejected?

Using silver dollars does have a repelling effect on gold yuan, but from an objective point of view, this cannot be attributed to silver dollars, but is an inevitable result of inflation. If we still want to preserve the use of gold yuan and prohibit the use of silver dollars, it would be like cutting off one's nose to spite one's face. Moreover, some government agencies now actually use silver dollars as the unit of income and expenditure. Finance Minister Liu has also stated that the treasury's monthly expenditure now requires 120 million silver dollars. The government everywhere discusses silver dollars, is it only responsible for restricting people from using silver dollars as the unit of account and commodity pricing?

The issue of managing silver dollar trading, although not the core of the silver dollar issue, is the most likely to cause disturbances. For example, in the past, people mentioned the street trading of silver dollars, which hindered traffic, so the municipal authorities arrested people on the road, resulting in great social unrest. Of course, street trading is not a legal place, but it is not that peddlers are willing to do this, but are really forced by life. The government has not provided them with opportunities to find employment. Does it still have to break their last remaining rice bowl? Moreover, the profits they earn in trading are very small. In terms of the current trading of silver dollars, it is only about ten to twenty thousand yuan, which is by no means the shocking amount of more than fifty thousand yuan that exchange shops differ.

In addition, the current general issue of silver dollar prices is also very important. In the past, some people believed that the current silver dollar price is an unreasonable and abnormal phenomenon and is also a factor leading the rising trend, so it must be suppressed with all efforts. This statement can be said to be wrong. Because the current price increase in the current stage is an inevitable phenomenon under production shrinkage and currency inflation, and it is not something that any commodity can lead. Furthermore, people's preferences are originally a natural trend in economics. It is impossible to go against it in times of peace, let alone in the current period of deepening economic crisis. How can it be changed abruptly? To go further, the purchasing power unit of silver dollars is small, so the targets of buying and selling are mostly salaried people. Even if the current government still has the strength, it should not fire the first shot at these savers who have earned their silver dollar savings with their blood and sweat!

In short, we believe that if the government wants to stabilize currency value and stabilize people's livelihoods, it may as well implement a transitional bimetallic system. In principle, the gold yuan is still one of the main currencies, but in practice, the silver dollar becomes the tool for payment. As long as it is handled properly, recognizing the established facts and guiding the situation accordingly, we can always receive real results. Although some people think that adopting the silver standard system now is inevitably a step backwards, but when we observe the facts, we should analyze the general situation and not aim too high. At present, the weakness of general purchasing power in the country has reached the extreme, and the distance from the period of using the actual gold standard is still far away.

### Regarding the Recent Developments in the Chinese Situation, the United Nations Maintains a Wait-and-See Attitude; Britain and the United States Will Re-examine Their China Policy

[United Press, Lake Success, 23rd] It is reported here today that the British Bureau of Investigation has received a copy of documents of Soviet aid to the Chinese Communists. The reporter insisted that the documents prove that the Moscow government is clearly cooperating with the Chinese Communists, but did not elaborate. The Chinese delegation to the United Nations agencies was interested in the report, but did not officially indicate what action it would take. Some representatives of the United Nations said that if the documents have sufficient evidence, the Chinese government can file a complaint against the Soviet Union in the Security Council. The Chinese delegation held a special meeting today to discuss this report, but there was no change in its wait-and-see policy. According to the United Nations, China had intended to raise the issue of the Chinese situation in the United Nations General Assembly, accusing the Soviet Union of not fully complying with the treaty, but this move has now been abandoned. The Soviet Union has taken the most accurate approach to the National Government. According to current reports, the United Nations agencies can do nothing about the Chinese civil war. China has not filed a complaint, and United Nations Secretary-General Lie had made it clear last winter that he did not intend to intervene as a mediator, and no other members have expressed their intention to raise the issue of the Chinese situation. However, Western representatives said privately that the shelling of British warships on the Yangtze River will undoubtedly cause Britain and the United States to re-examine their entire China policy.

### The Soviet Union Makes Another Attempt to the United States to Resume Negotiations to Resolve the German Problem; Britain and the United States Fail to Reach Agreement with France

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 23rd] Well-informed sources confirmed that Soviet representative to the United Nations Malik and US representative Jessup are still holding talks in Lake Success. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko went to New York after the start of the talks, so he did not formally participate. It is said that the Soviet side has suggested lifting the Berlin blockade and advocating that a meeting of foreign ministers of the occupying countries be convened immediately to discuss the issue of German unification.

Therefore, the question today is no longer whether the Soviet Union accepts the preconditions of the Western countries for the resumption of the Four-Power talks, but whether the West is willing to consult with the Soviet Union on the issue of Germany's status after the Soviet Union implements this measure. It is said that the Soviet side did not put forward any conditions for the resumption of negotiations, and did not ask the Western countries to suspend the establishment of the West German Republic pending the convening of the Four-Power Conference. It is also said that the US is preparing to accept the current Soviet proposal to resume the Four-Power talks, and is constantly notifying Britain and France of the progress of the Malik-Jessup talks. France's attitude is the same as that of the United States, but Britain opposes it, believing that the Western countries should insist on their current position pending the creation of the West German Constitution. Because the unity of East Germany is currently stronger than that of West Germany, if negotiations are held now, East Germany may dominate West Germany in the future.

[United Press, Frankfurt, 23rd] German Social Democratic Party leader Schumacher apparently advocated an early end to the Berlin blockade, telling his party members that they must not allow the West German government to be established now. Three days ago, at a secret meeting of the party in Hanover, Schumacher issued this instruction. It is not known that the person in charge of the proceedings of the meeting on the 23rd spread Schumacher's teachings. Schumacher also told the party meeting that the short constitution proposed by the Social Democrats may not be acceptable to the Allies or other German parties. He claimed after the meeting that the Social Democratic Party was willing to negotiate on the basis of their proposed West German constitution. He said on the 23rd that the note from the Allied foreign ministers on the 22nd, promising to "sympathetically consider" the Social Democratic Party's demand for closer central control over German expenditures, was "the first hopeful result of our clear stance."

### US Military Exercise on the German-Czech Border Ends

### Johnson Orders US Navy to Stop Building Super Aircraft Carrier

[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] US Secretary of Defense Johnson today ordered the US Navy to stop construction of a 65,000-ton aircraft carrier. The keel of the ship was just laid on Monday at the Virginia naval shipyard. Johnson's memorandum to Navy Secretary Sullivan stated that after reviewing the opinions of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and meeting with President Truman, he had decided to suspend the construction of the ship. According to the Air Force and Navy, there has been considerable controversy over the construction of the super aircraft carrier, and the Air Force believes that the Navy's construction of the carrier, which can be used for the take-off and landing of B-29 aircraft, infringes on the strategic bombing mission of the Air Force. The Navy has spent six million dollars designing the ship.

### Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg Receive German Territory; German Slogans Found on Street Walls

[Reuters, Netherlands-German Border, 23rd] The troops of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg entered the new territory recently transferred from West Germany to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg on time last night and today. No incidents have occurred so far tonight. When the troops entered, they were led by border police on motorcycles, followed by trucks full of soldiers, with police protection on the west side, followed by vehicles for military supplies.

When entering the city of Erden, the residents watched calmly, seemingly unmoved. Only someone in the only house in the city flying the Dutch flag leaned out of the window and cheered the Dutch army. Erden Mayor Lockner waited for the arrival of the new Mayor Bloppo in the city center. German-written slogans appeared on the walls of the streets, such as "Germany, always Germany," and the largest slogan was "Friendship, yes; annexation, no." At a German customs station a few kilometers east of the city of Sida, when the Dutch army arrived, all the objects had been removed, leaving a mess. In one room, even the floor had been pried up, and many of the wall panels were missing. Residents in the area went to work as usual this morning, seemingly unaware.

### New Method for Public Utility Charges to Be Implemented Today; Price Index for Today is 140,000 Times

[This Newspaper News] Due to the impact of the straight-line rise in commodity prices, the city's public utilities are on the verge of stagnation. The various companies have repeatedly submitted reports to the municipal government requesting a quick solution. After drafting a new method of pricing and charging, it was sent to the Public Utilities Committee of the Municipal Council for approval for trial implementation a few days ago. In the future, users will pay fees, except for those who prepay, they should pay according to the public utility pricing index announced by the municipal government on the day, multiplied by the base number originally approved on March 1. Water, electricity, gas, and telephone will be calculated from today's (25th) meter reading (today's index is 140,000 times). Bills issued before today's meter reading that have not exceeded the payment deadline will still be charged at the original price listed on the bill, and if overdue, they will be handled according to the new method. The Public Utilities Bureau also stipulates that users can bring their last bill and prepay one month's worth of fees for the convenience of citizens. The company will settle the account according to the index on the date of collection and collect the fees in several units, which will not be affected by future price increases. It has also ordered the companies to collect fees at the index of 140,000 times today and tomorrow, but only direct payments to the company's collection points are allowed. (Collection banks and other places do not accept payments)

### Municipal Government Employees' Salaries to Be Issued by the Finance Bureau Today

[This Newspaper News] In order to issue the salaries of municipal government employees for this month today, the Municipal Finance Bureau worked as usual yesterday, Sunday, with all staff present. The total salary amount for more than 50,000 municipal government employees throughout the city is 50 billion yuan, all of which was obtained through loans from the Central Bank. The loan and allocation procedures have been completed. However, when the reporter visited Qian Jianfu, the acting director of the Finance Bureau, yesterday, he appeared restless and anxious. It is said that he is worried about the situation today, because although the money has been borrowed, the cash still needs to be collected from the Central Bank today. Acting Director Qian is extremely anxious because all the poor civil servants are eagerly waiting for the money to get through this chaotic time, so the responsibility is so great. He also said that this money was obtained through countless hardships and loans, and it is truly a banknote with every drop of blood. He hopes that it can be properly delivered to the hands of all employees today so that they can barely maintain the minimum living standard for a short time.

### Wartime Scenery: Families Moving from Suburbs, Long-Distance Buses Suspended

Suzhou Creek Looks Brand New, Theaters and Dance Halls Alone Thrive

[Our Newspaper's Report] As the overall situation takes a sharp turn, Shanghai has generally been covered by a wartime atmosphere since yesterday. Stations, docks, and airports are crowded with people and piled with luggage. Residents in areas such as Xujiahui, Jiangwan, Hongkou, Pudong, and Nanshi are mostly moving to the central district with boxes and luggage. Residents in the central district are rushing to buy firewood, rice, and food supplies. Rickshaws can be seen lined up end to end on the roads.

With the exception of trains, all external transportation in the city has been suspended since yesterday. Long-distance buses to Shangsong, Qinghu, and Minzhe have stopped running. After the Garrison Department announced restrictions on the entry of passengers, inspections at various highway entrances are extremely strict, making it quite difficult for passengers from counties near Shanghai to come to Shanghai.

According to people coming from Songjiang and Qingpu: Starting yesterday, local authorities in these counties are also carrying out emergency evacuations, causing chaos. Robberies have even been seen in the countryside, but this information cannot be verified.

Because many silver dollars are brought by passengers passing through Shanghai, and they are eager to sell them, coupled with the fact that promissory notes are rejected by various stores and there is an insufficient supply of cash, and residents are selling their belongings to buy supplies in response to the situation, the price of Yuan Datou silver dollars has plummeted, with the closing price in the evening only between 350,000 and 370,000.

Yesterday was a weekly holiday, and the business of cinemas was still booming. The average occupancy rate in dance halls was also more than 60%. In parks, couples were often seen side by side, chatting intimately.

The boats that have always gathered in Suzhou Creek were ordered by the military and police authorities to be moved to the Huangpu River, and they were all cleared by noon, giving Suzhou Creek a brand-new look.

Vegetable prices have continued to lead the way in the past two days. Coal briquettes, charcoal, soybean oil, canned food, and salted goods have become the target of mass purchases, and prices are changing several times a day. Luxury goods and heavier items are not being asked about, and there are few customers in department stores.

Rice prices were extremely chaotic yesterday, with different prices being quoted in different districts, mostly around 89 Yuan Datou per shi.

### Shanghai-Nanjing Train Connects to Suzhou, Order at North Station Is Quite Chaotic, It Is Reported that Zhenjiang-Nanjing Passenger Trains Have Resumed

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the abandonment of Wuxi, the Shanghai-Nanjing railway has temporarily been connected to Suzhou, but there have been no trains going there since the afternoon. No more than one in ten passengers on the trains coming from the east are ordinary passengers, and most are soldiers and their families. The last train departed from Wangting and arrived in Shanghai at around 2 PM. The dedicated telephone line of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau has been cut off since yesterday. It is widely rumored at the North Station that the staff of the railway bureau remaining between Nanjing and Zhenjiang have resumed passenger train service starting yesterday. Shanghai-Hangzhou passenger trains are operating as usual, and passenger space is crowded. As soon as the railway bureau encounters spare vehicles, it immediately organizes trains to add extra services to evacuate excess passengers. The order at the North Station gradually became chaotic starting at noon yesterday. Boxes, luggage, and packages of all sizes piled up in the North Station hall and on various platforms. Soldiers and their families cooked and ate on the spot, creating a colorful spectacle. Rickshaws were not managed, and they entered the hall or ticket gates. Shanghai-Hangzhou trains were also unable to depart on time due to the impact of military vehicles. However, the railway bureau staff continued to adhere to their positions and work hard. The bureau is currently raising funds to purchase rice for distribution to employees in response to the situation.

The transaction price of gold was 41 Yuan Datou for sale and 38 Yuan Datou for purchase per tael. There were many customers seeking to exchange gold for silver dollars.
