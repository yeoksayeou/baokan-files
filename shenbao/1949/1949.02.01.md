Mr. Li immediately solicited everyone's opinions on peace. Premier of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, and Vice-Premier Tiecheng, were both present. At around 12:00 noon, he had lunch with all the attendees. After the meal, Acting President Li held a discussion with Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, and the heads of various ministries and commissions who remained in Shanghai. At 3:30 PM, Acting President Li left first and drove to visit Madam Sun and He Yingqin, etc. At 4:45 PM, he rushed to Longhua Airport and took off on the original plane at around 5:00 PM to return to Beijing, accompanied by Gan Jiehou, Huang Xuecun, and others. Those who went to the airport to see him off included Wu Tiecheng, Hong Lanyou, He Chengjun, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Guozhen, Chen Daqing, Yang Hu, and Yu Shuping, etc. When Acting President Li was leaving, he told reporters: "We will continue to work hard to promote peace, and the government has decided to move to Guangzhou."

[News from this Newspaper] Since noon yesterday, the heads of various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan held an important military meeting on the fourth floor of the Bank of China building on the Bund here. In addition to Premier Sun, Vice-Premier Wu, and the heads of various ministries and commissions, Hong Lanyou, Xu Kan, Zhu Jiahua, Liu Weichi, Zuo Shunsheng, and Duan Caihai, etc., more than ten people, Acting President Li also attended the meeting, but left early midway, and the Executive Yuan meeting did not end until 4:20 PM. After the meeting, all the heads remained tight-lipped about the content of the meeting. However, it is understood that the government has drafted a formal statement in response to the broadcast by the CCP spokesperson on the evening of January 28, which was sent to the Central News Agency in Beijing last night (31st) for release. Acting President Li also decided to invite five non-partisan social leaders here, Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, Leng Yuqiu, Chen Guangfu, and Jiang Yong, to fly to Beiping in a private capacity to contact representatives of the CCP, inquire whether the CCP is willing to negotiate peace, and if they are willing, to ask them to appoint representatives, designate a location and time, and conduct peace talks as soon as possible. In addition, they also exchanged detailed opinions on the promotion of peace talks and various measures after the government moved to Guangzhou.

Shao Lizi did not participate in yesterday's meeting. Shao was discovered by reporters in the corridor and immediately surrounded. Shao only said: "You have more information than I do. I have no opinion to express now." Premier Sun left in a hurry after the meeting and was unwilling to speak. Xu Kan and Zhu Jiahua did not give a definite answer on whether to go to Beijing or Guangzhou. Liu Gongyun simply said: "I don't know." Wu Tiecheng left a step late and was surrounded by reporters. He answered reporters' questions, saying: "The government has decided to move to Guangzhou on the 5th, and I will go to Guangzhou before the 5th. Judging from the CCP's previous broadcasts, the hope for the future of peace is very small, but it has not reached the point of despair." Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Duan Mukai, shouted to the reporters as he stepped into the elevator: "The government has decided to move the capital, and we will continue to work hard for peace."

### Two-Thirds of the Foreign Embassies in the Capital Move to Guangzhou; The Executive Yuan is Scheduled to Hold a Political Affairs Meeting in Guangzhou on the 3rd

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st Dispatch] The government's move to the south will complete its factual and legal significance due to the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting in Guangzhou on the 3rd. The relocation of foreign embassies in China is also gradually being put into action, but since Acting President Li is still stationed in Nanjing, few foreign envoys have gone south. Most have sent staff members to plan everything in advance. Some staff members of the US Embassy, led by Minister Clark, flew to Guangzhou on the 29th. US Ambassador Stuart Lei Deng continued to stay here and handle official business as usual. At 4:30 PM on the 30th, he still went to Jinling University for worship. The embassy and the ambassador's residence were as quiet as ever. A few officials from the Soviet Embassy also flew south on the 30th. Ambassador Luoshen's illness has recovered, and he is scheduled to leave Beijing for Guangzhou on the 2nd, becoming the first among the envoys to take action. However, the embassy spokesperson remained silent on the move to the south. The work in the office is still very busy, as usual. He did not deny the possibility that the ambassador may return to Moscow to report on his duties in the future. The attitude of the British and its autonomous dominion embassies towards the move to the south seems quite indifferent. Apart from the British Embassy sending Counselor Gao Helu to fly to Guangzhou on the 2nd, there is no other action. Indian Ambassador Panigai and French Ambassador Meili Ai both refused to disclose any preparations for the move to the south. Burmese Ambassador Yu Midun said that the embassy secretary, Taiwan Zao, will go to Guangzhou on the 2nd to arrange the premises. Egyptian Ambassador Ismail also said that he would send a secretary south soon. Most other foreign embassies remained silent. According to sources, it is estimated that two-thirds of the national embassies will move to Guangzhou with the government in the short term, and the remaining one-third may stay in Beijing on the orders of their home countries.

### He Yingqin Will Take an Important Position; His Hemorrhoids Will Recover Soon and He Will Go to Beijing Within Days

[News from this Newspaper] General He Yingqin previously suffered from hemorrhoids and came to Shanghai for treatment. After undergoing surgery a few days ago, he recovered very well. He has now moved from the National Defense Hospital back to his private residence on Linsen Road for recuperation and is expected to recover to normal within days. It is learned that the government is urging Mr. He to take up an important position. A certain central figure came to Shanghai a few days ago and visited Mr. He at his private residence to convey the government's opinions. In addition, on New Year's Day of the lunar calendar, General Bai Chongxi from Hankou made two long-distance phone calls to discuss the current situation with Mr. He. General Tang Enbo, Commander of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison, also visited him after arriving in Shanghai. Yesterday, after Acting President Li visited Shanghai, he also had a long discussion with Mr. He. According to reliable sources, Mr. He may take up an important position after his health is restored. Mr. He was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai for Taiwan by ship on February 1 to recuperate, but after being persuaded, he has cancelled his trip to Taiwan. As soon as the hemorrhoids heal, he may go to Beijing within days. Note: When the National Government established its capital in Nanjing in 1927, and Sun Chuanfang secretly crossed the Yangtze River to attack Longtan, General He Yingqin presided over military affairs and reversed the critical situation in one battle, creating brilliant achievements. Currently, the Communist army is declaring an attack on the south bank of the Yangtze River. It is expected that General Tang's visit this time is related to the Yangtze River defense issue. According to a certain military observer, it is not easy for the Communist army to cross the river based on their strength, and the national army has gathered considerable strength along the river. The Ministry of National Defense has made it clear that it will resist if the Communist army crosses the river and invades. The Beijing-Shanghai line is the essence of the country, and Shanghai is the largest base of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. It can also be regarded as the Stalingrad of the German-Soviet War.

### Xue Yue Firmly Stated that Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Fujian Will Be the Last Line of Defense Against Communism; The Alliance of the Four Provinces is Being Planned

[United Press, Guangzhou, 31st Dispatch] The newly appointed Chairman of Guangdong, Xue Yue, told reporters today that the four provinces of South China are preparing to be the last line of defense against communism. Regardless of the outcome of the peace talks in North China, I intend to lead the people of the four provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Fujian to defend themselves and resist communism, not hesitating to sacrifice themselves. The alliance of the four provinces is being planned. When asked by reporters whether the independent operations of the provinces in South China were a split from the Nanjing government, Mr. Xue replied: "We are fighting against both the feudal system and communism. As the chairman of the province, I intend to engage in the political and economic reforms that have been neglected in the past. If the current peace efforts fail, Mr. Jiang will make a comeback." Mr. Xue emphasized the independent position of the four provinces in South China. Mr. Xue finally said that China's anti-communist struggle and the United States' anti-communist struggle in the Pacific are now concentrated in the provinces of South China. Although the number of national defense forces in Guangdong Province is no match for the 60,000 armed separatist elements in Guangdong Province, this struggle is a joint effort of the four provinces and is not isolated.

The radio station also called on the generals of Qingdao, Taiyuan, Gui Sui, and other cities in North China and other government-controlled areas to "learn from General Fu Zuoyi's example and implement true peace." Regarding Fu himself, the radio station claimed: "Fu Zuoyi once carried out the so-called suppression of the rebellion order, and therefore became one of the war criminals, but since he accepted the peace conditions and drove the troops out of the city to await reorganization, as long as he continues to do work that is beneficial to the people in the future, he may still be forgiven by the people and allowed to show remorse by good deeds."

### Bai Chongxi Received People from All Walks of Life and Reported on the Trend of the Situation; Peace Cannot Be Sought from One Side; He Will Never Give Up Until the Hope Is Extinguished

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 31st Dispatch] The dull atmosphere in Wuhan turned bright on the 31st. Commander-in-Chief Bai held a Spring Festival tea party at 3:00 PM to report on the trend of the situation to the local elders and public representatives. Mr. Bai first stated the process of seeking peace, saying: People in various places, in view of the tragic pain of the eight-year war of resistance and the three-year civil war, have universally issued peace calls. In order to comply with public opinion, the government has not hesitated to compromise and seek perfection, making the greatest concessions to show its sincerity in seeking peace, such as President Chiang Kai-shek's New Year's message, his resignation, Acting President Li's announcement of seven measures, and the appointment of peace negotiation representatives, admitting that the eight conditions are the basis for peace talks, etc., all of which have been done to the best of our ability, and the facts are all there. However, the CCP has not only shown no sincerity in peace talks, but also continued its military offensive on Jinpu, Longhai, Pinghan, and Jingmen and Dangyang in northern Hubei, which has prevented peace from developing smoothly, creating today's stalemate. At this point, Mr. Bai declared in a calm and firm tone: Under this situation, the government will never give up peace before the hope of peace is extinguished, and must adhere to its original intention and make the greatest and best efforts in order to respect public opinion and achieve true peace. However, if the Communist army continues to advance and the war continues as a result, making peace hopeless, then the responsibility for this will be judged by the people. When talking about the Wuhan Peace Promotion Association's hope that there will be no war in Wuhan, Mr. Bai calmly said that he personally also has this wish, but peace cannot be sought from one side. In addition to urging the government, people from all walks of life must also earnestly appeal to the CCP, asking it to stop the war immediately, so that there is hope for the future of peace and the safety of Wuhan can be ensured. Mr. Bai's speech was implicit and clear, and everyone responded with warm applause. Also, after Mr. Bai finished his speech, representatives from all walks of life, who had been very silent, spoke one after another, full of indignation. Zhao Shibin, director of the rickshaw drivers' union, advocated that the people should propose a list of communist war criminals and let the people judge them. Cheng Ziju, director of the Chamber of Commerce, hoped that the government would continue to work hard for peace, and if there were obstacles, he would be willing to support the government in implementing a comprehensive "peace war." Professor Wang Menglin of Zhongda University said, "If we are wronged and cannot achieve perfection, we can only comfort the people and punish the criminals." Zhang Yaoxian, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, stated that peace cannot be partial, but must reform politics and economics to seek a thorough and comprehensive peace.

### Government Response to CCP Statement, Hoping to Promote Early Opening of Peace Talks with Utmost Sincerity

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] The government spokesperson on the 31st issued a response statement to the CCP's statement on the 28th (content published on page 2); according to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from northern Shaanxi on the 28th, the CCP spokesperson issued a statement regarding the peace proposals put forward by the government. The main points of the opinions they raised in that statement can be summarized as follows: (1) They cannot agree with the acquittal of Japanese war criminal Neiji Okamura. (2) The government should first arrest the so-called "war criminals" they have proposed to sufficiently demonstrate the government's sincerity for peace. (3) The government's attitude toward the local peace efforts in Beiping is not serious enough. Our first impression of this statement is that the attitude seems not "serious" enough, but we are still willing to calmly answer it: Regarding the Okamura Neiji case, it is a judicial issue that is completely unrelated to peace talks, and it cannot be used as a prerequisite for peace talks. The government handles many affairs every day. If the CCP side introduces such extraneous issues, raising one issue today and another tomorrow, we will not only be unable to cope with it, but the two parties will become unable to approach each other. Secondly, regarding the point that "war criminals" should be arrested first, we believe that today both sides are preparing to conduct peace talks, and the government has already acknowledged its willingness to hold negotiations based on the eight conditions proposed by the CCP, then all the conditions that have been put forward should of course be resolved in the meeting. It is absolutely impossible to demand execution first and then hold a meeting. If the conditions can be executed without discussion, why would peace talks be necessary? This may make the people suspect whether the Communist side is truly sincere about peace. We cannot help but feel deeply sorry for this, because true peace should not have preconditions. Previously, we advocated a ceasefire first, followed by peace talks, and the Communist side also criticized us for the same reason, saying that we were not sincere. Regarding the third point, they did not raise any specific content, so we have no way to answer it. In short, we feel that everyone – whether on the government side or the CCP side – should first have a correct basic concept, which is that the demand for peace today is the common will of the people of the whole country. We are seeking a way to resolve domestic disputes through political means in order to follow the will of the people. We must respect each other and be tolerant of each other in order to make the peace talks begin quickly and proceed smoothly. Whoever is not sincere will be criticized and opposed by the people. At the same time, we hope that the CCP side will know that the government side today is not unable to fight again, but unwilling to fight again, and cannot bear to fight again. Because today's country and people really cannot withstand the persecution and devastation of war. If we acknowledge that the purpose of the revolution is for the interests of the people and the country, and that the motive of the revolution is based on the will of the majority of the people, then at a time when the country and the people are suffering so much, and when the people of the whole country are demanding peace, we have absolutely no reason to continue engaging in war. At the same time, we should understand that in today's war situation, although the Communist army has won several battles and occupied several cities in the past few months, a temporary military advantage is not enough to determine the final victory or defeat, and war can never solve problems. This is a lesson of history. Only political means can solve everything, and only mutual tolerance for the sake of the country and open and honest dialogue can permanently eliminate the scourge of war and permanently establish peace. As for what the spokesperson said, "You have angered the people, the people have unanimously risen up to oppose you and fight you to the death, the people do not like you, and you have turned around to seek peace," there is no need to respond to this point. However, as far as we know, the people in the CCP areas are still living a very painful life, and the people and students in the CCP-occupied areas are fleeing to the government areas one after another. This is an iron fact. Regarding this point, we will only mention it in passing here and do not want to provoke a debate because of it. Fortunately, the facts can speak for themselves, and the people's hearts have a fair judgment. In short, we are working to achieve peace for the sake of the country and the people. The people are longing for the arrival of peace. We sincerely hope that the CCP side will also use the utmost sincerity to promote the early convening of peace talks and to stop the war as soon as possible. This is not only the wish of the government side, but also the wish of the people of the whole country.

### Talking About Peace in the New Year

The New Year holiday has passed in a flash. The sunshine is shining, the gentle breeze is pleasant, and people have a feeling that winter is over and spring has returned. When relatives and friends meet, they follow the old customs, and sounds of congratulations fill the air. But upon reflection, where does the joy come from? Everyone's mind is filled with words of self-consolation and consolation, based on the hope for peace.

The term "peace" represents harmony and symbolizes a peaceful scene, which is what everyone desires. If weapons can be turned into gifts and the atmosphere of hostility can be turned into auspiciousness, who would not welcome it? However, President Chiang's New Year's Day message was issued a month ago, and Acting President Li has been in charge of the central government for more than ten days. Their pursuit of peace is not only reflected in humble words, but also in sincere and unremitting actions. President Chiang has resolutely retired, and Acting President Li came to Shanghai yesterday to solicit the opinions of social leaders, asking Mr. Yan Huiqing and others to go to Beiping to inquire about the CCP's true intentions, in an attempt to prevent the door to peace from being blocked again. This shows that the government officials can truly understand the depth of the people's suffering and are doing their best to seek peace. However, what is the CCP's response? Is peace still a distant and unattainable prospect?

CCP Chairman Mao Zedong broadcast his eight-point basis for peace talks. The content of which has been discussed in this newspaper before. Acting President Li even telegraphed Mr. Mao expressing his willingness to start negotiations based on these eight points. Logically speaking, as long as the CCP designates representatives and specifies a location, peace talks can proceed, and the flames of war can cease. Unexpectedly, one wave subsides, and another rises. The CCP's demands are clearly increasing inch by inch. The list of "war criminals" has been increasing batch after batch, perhaps without end, and their so-called "order" to the Nanjing National Government to first arrest "war criminals" and send them to the CCP for trial is becoming more and more demanding day by day. Under this circumstance, even if Acting President Li is a person with extreme "patience and self-cultivation," it would be difficult for him to go in person and offer himself for punishment. Indeed, a person who can truly understand the suffering of the people, if he can determine that his own punishment can save the people from being poisoned again, may be able to embrace the sacrificial spirit of Buddha feeding the tiger and throw himself into the tiger's den. But at least he needs to know that after he throws himself into the tiger's mouth, the people will be spared the tiger's scourge after all. But what about now? If batches of so-called "war criminals" are sent forward, naked and leading a goat, before the CCP stops advancing, before peace is achieved, and before the people's right to a free life is guaranteed, and in the future the people will still be slaughtered, persecuted, and suffer the pain of wives and children being separated and crying in hunger, then can this kind of humiliating surrender-style peace really benefit the people?

Moreover, peace, peace, these two words are inseparable. Without harmony, there can be no peace, and without peace, there can be no harmony. Harmony and peace, peace and harmony, complement each other and are mutually causal. We the people, certainly do not favor any party, but in our hearts we have a perfectly fair and just view. The government officials in the past were indeed mostly unworthy, but the CCP may not be able to make all the people sincerely convinced, otherwise, where do tens of thousands of refugees come from? Let's not talk about the past. Today, the government and the CCP both claim to be saving the country and the people, and "liberating" the people. The most important and urgent thing for the people at present is to immediately stop fighting and immediately cease fire. Only a ceasefire is a symbol of "harmony" and the beginning of "harmony." The government has now declared its willingness to cease fire immediately. We the people only need to ask the CCP: Do you want to cease fire immediately or not? If the war is stopped, everything can be discussed, both sides can talk openly and honestly, and both sides can talk frankly. If, on the one hand, they are willing to talk about peace, and on the other hand, they are still advancing, this is simply ridiculous! The war has now reached the Yangtze River. This is the best opportunity for both sides to truly act for the people and stop fighting and make peace. The government is withdrawing its troops step by step in northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui, and at least it can be said that it has absolutely no intention of launching a counterattack on the north bank of the Yangtze River. Therefore, as long as the CCP does not take advantage of this to advance and no longer provoke war with artillery fire, then once the war stops, the door to peace can be opened. However, what will be the CCP's response in the next few days? Can they be moved by the suffering of the people because of the northward flight of Mr. Yan Huiqing and other elderly gentlemen?

Secondly, peace and war are a whole, two sides of the same coin. If the overall situation does not have comprehensive peace, then local peace is also futile. This is a very simple principle. Because the current war has no so-called front or rear, there is a painful war life as long as there is war for one day. Even if Beiping signs local peace terms, if there is no comprehensive peace in the future and they continue to wage war against each other, can the people of Beiping transcend the war and live a leisurely life? The "joining the army" (i.e., conscription in the Communist areas) in Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, the "liquidation" in Jinan and Tianjin... the people of Beiping will not be immune to the taste of wartime life experienced by the people in these Communist areas. The Beijing-Shanghai area has not yet reached the day of encirclement, but some people are already blindly advocating local peace. This is not a sincere attempt to seek peace, but to take advantage of the people's desire for temporary security and pave the way for the CCP to "accept surrender." This is called hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat's false peace! In fact, if the people are really willing to surrender to the CCP and sacrifice their free life, that's fine. If not, then those who talk carelessly about local peace are no different from making us drink poison to quench our thirst. Although the thirst is quenched, life is not guaranteed, and we will inevitably regret it in the future. Therefore, we are definitely not pro-war, we are determined to have peace, but what we want is comprehensive peace, overall peace, permanent peace, and definitely not local peace in one place or corner, nor temporary peace for one month or half a month.

Finally, we must also remind those who are currently overwhelmed by the call for peace: peace cannot be obtained without paying a price. We, the people, must have strength, we must use our strength, show others that we cannot be deceived, show others that we cannot be conquered, and then we can obtain true peace. US Secretary of State Acheson said: "Anyone who attempts to attack or threaten the security of our country with force will encounter overwhelming resistance." The reason why Marshal Stalin declared his willingness to meet with President Truman to discuss the peace issue between the US and the Soviet Union today is because the United States has this kind of "strength." To generalize, the Soviet people have the strength to defend Stalingrad, and the British people have the strength to defend the British Isles, and then there is the peace enjoyed by the people of the two countries, Britain and the Soviet Union, after the Second World War. Therefore, to put it narrowly, if the citizens of Shanghai really want to enjoy true peace and permanent peace, they must first have the strength to defend Greater Shanghai. To put it broadly, if the National Government really wants to seek true peace and permanent peace for the people, it is better to seek it from its own strength, especially from strengthening the defense of the Yangtze River, than from the sincerity of seeking it from the CCP. If you have strength but cannot use it, and you have the Yangtze River but cannot defend it, what are you still talking about peace?

### McCarran Urges US to Lend 1.5 Billion to Aid China, Cleveland Says 50 Million in US Aid Will Continue to Be Shipped to China

[US Information Service, Washington, 30th] Since the Democratic Party organized the new Congress, the Joint Committee on Foreign Economic Cooperation of the Senate and House of Representatives held its first meeting. After the election, Senator McCarran (Democratic Senator from Nevada) will assume the chairmanship of the committee. After the meeting, McCarran issued a statement to the press, urging the United States to lend US$1.5 billion to China under the rule of the Kuomintang to continue resisting the Communist Party's operations.

[Associated Press, Washington, 29th] Senator McCarran (Democrat), chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Economic Cooperation of the Senate and House of Representatives, said that the time has come for the United States to take an anti-communist stance in Asia, as it has done in Europe. The United States should use 600 to 700 million yuan for direct military assistance to China, 200 to 300 million yuan for civilian daily necessities assistance, and allocate several hundred million to allow them to purchase silver from the US Treasury Department as a stabilization fund to consolidate the Chinese monetary system. This plan will not be submitted to Congress for the time being, but may be submitted in the future. I want to first observe what the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the State Department do with China. There are several prerequisites for US aid to China, one of which is the reorganization of the Chinese government. At the same time, the Chinese army must be thoroughly subject to US military supervision. The United States will send about 600 to 700 military officers to stay in China. Some people say that sending a US military officers group to China will cause a war between the US and the Soviet Union. I don't think so. It is well known that Soviet generals support the CCP. Captured CCP generals have admitted to following the orders of the Kremlin officials. The economic part of my plan can be incorporated into the new Economic Cooperation Act, which will be discussed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee starting on February 8, and military assistance is another issue.

[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] Cleveland, director of the China program of the Economic Cooperation Administration, announced on the night of the 27th that supplies worth approximately 50 million yuan in US aid to China would continue to be shipped to China, pending further instructions. These supplies include so-called emergency supplies, such as rice, cotton, fertilizer, kerosene, and some coal. The distribution is as follows: (1) Rice worth approximately 21 million yuan will be supplied to the household rations in Shanghai and other large cities in South China. (2) Cotton is worth 15 million yuan. (3) Fertilizer is worth 9 million yuan and is used for spring plowing. (4) Fuel oil is worth 5 million yuan and is supplied to cities in South China. Mr. Cleveland also reiterated his previous statement that food and daily necessities worth 4 million yuan left in Tianjin and Beiping under the occupation of the Communist army will continue to be distributed, but relief supplies will no longer be shipped to the occupied areas in the future.

[Associated Press, San Francisco, 30th] Griffin, Deputy Director of the China Branch of the Economic Cooperation Administration, left yesterday to return to his post in Shanghai. Before leaving, reporters asked whether the handling of relief affairs in the Communist-occupied areas had been discussed during this return to the country to report on his work. Mr. Griffin replied: "This is a matter for the State Department and the President to decide." A reporter asked for his views on the Chinese situation. Mr. Griffin said: "We should rebuild a nationally unified policy on China." Mr. Griffin said that he would not worry about his personal safety after returning to his post. Mrs. Griffin did not accompany him to China.

[Economic Cooperation Agency City News] Fisher, former acting director of the Korean branch of the Economic Cooperation Administration, has arrived in Shanghai by plane from Seoul and is preparing to stay here for several days to meet with officials from the Economic Cooperation Administration's China branch.

### Spokesperson of the Central Propaganda Department Talks About the Situation of Newspapers in Beiping and Tianjin

Huabei Daily Loses Freedom of Speech, Tianjin Minguo Daily Has Been Taken Over

[Central News Agency, This City] A spokesman for the Central Propaganda Department of the Chinese Kuomintang declared: Since the national army successively withdrew from Beiping and the Communist army entered the city, the Huabei Daily has lost freedom of speech. The president of the newspaper, Zhang Mingwei, was ordered to leave Beiping and come to Nanjing in advance, and he will no longer be responsible for any substantive position in the newspaper. The spokesperson also said: The Tianjin Minguo Daily has now been taken over by the Communist Party, and all employees have been forced to leave the newspaper. The editors and publishers of the Beiping Huabei Daily have lost their freedom. These two events are enough to make journalists realize that there is no such thing as freedom of the press under the control of the Communist Party.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Decides to Move to Shengze, First Batch of Personnel Arrives in Suzhou from Zhenjiang, Water Police Bureau Fleet Sails to Suzhou for Stationing

### Japanese War Criminals in China Will Be Transferred to Tokyo Prison

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 31st] Okamura Neiji, former commander-in-chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, and 160 convicted war criminals will be sent back to Japan on the American ship John Weeks to be imprisoned in Sugamo Prison in Tokyo. Although Okamura was acquitted by the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, the CCP's broadcast telegram expressed dissatisfaction with this judgment and demanded that he be handed over to the Communist army for retrial. A reporter asked Carpenter, head of the legal section of the Allied Headquarters, on what legal grounds the Japanese war criminals were handed over from China to the United States this time. Carpenter replied that the matter was decided by MacArthur himself, and the reason was presumably based on humanitarian and political reasons. He said that if the Japanese war criminals fell into the hands of the CCP, the CCP might mistreat them or use various bad means such as letting them off lightly for propaganda purposes.

### Content of the CCP's 28th Statement

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] On January 26th, the government spokesman issued a brief statement regarding the promotion of peace, responding to the CCP spokesman's statement on the 25th. It was believed that the CCP's failure to promptly appoint representatives, agree on a location, and cease military operations was aimed at delaying time and prolonging the war. Therefore, the government reiterated its sincerity for peace, hoping that the CCP would appoint representatives as soon as possible to conduct negotiations, so that peace could be realized at an early date. According to a Xinhua News Agency broadcast on the 28th, the CCP spokesman issued a lengthy statement in response to the government spokesman's statement on the 26th. The first paragraph of the statement emphasized opposition to the Defense Ministry's war criminal trial court's verdict on Okamura Yasuji. Subsequently, reasons were given for the delay in appointing peace talk representatives and agreeing on a location, and it was emphasized that the immediate arrest of the CCP's so-called "war criminals" was a prerequisite for peace talks. The content of the Xinhua News Agency broadcast "CCP Spokesman's Statement on the Peace Demands Put Forward by the Kuomintang Reactionary Government" is excerpted as follows: First, it stated: According to a Shanghai telegram from the Nanjing Central News Agency on the 26th, the former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces to China, Yasuji Okamura, was declared innocent at 4 p.m. on the 26th after a retrial by the War Criminal Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense. The CCP spokesman stated that this Japanese war criminal, Yasuji Okamura, the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces to China, was the main war criminal among all war criminals of the Japanese invasion of China. Now he has been declared innocent by the war criminal military tribunal of the Kuomintang reactionary government. The General Headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Liberation Army declare: This is unacceptable. We now warn the Nanjing reactionary government: "You should quickly arrest Yasuji Okamura without delay, because this is closely related to the matter of our joint negotiations that you are now requesting. We have the right to order you to re-arrest Yasuji Okamura and, in accordance with the time and location that we will notify you of, you will be responsible for escorting him to the People's Liberation Army. Other Japanese war criminals will be temporarily held by you. Hereafter, you must not release them or allow them to escape without authorization; those who violate this will be severely punished without leniency." Then it said:

"From the statement of the Nanjing reactionary government spokesman on January 26th, it seems that the gentlemen in Nanjing are so nervous, enthusiastic, diligent, and eager for peace talks, while the CCP seems so unconcerned, unenthusiastic, undiligent, and uneager about accepting your wishes. If you do not stop the war, you are delaying time and 'prolonging the war'. We honestly tell you, gentlemen in Nanjing, that you are war criminals, you are people who are to be tried. We do not believe in your so-called 'peace' and 'ceasefire'. Relying on the power of the United States, violating the will of the people, tearing up the ceasefire agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, you launched this extremely cruel anti-people, anti-democratic, anti-revolutionary civil war. At that time, you were so nervous, enthusiastic, and eager, ignoring the advice of millions of people. Now, after two and a half years, you have committed heinous crimes, and this debt must be settled. Although some of you are against liquidation and struggle, this liquidation and struggle is justified and must be liquidated, calculated, struggled, and debated. Therefore, you turn around and seek peace. You have put forward five points, and we have put forward eight points. The people immediately support our eight points and do not support your five points. You dare not criticize our eight points and dare not insist on your five points. You are willing to use our eight points as the basis for negotiation. Is this not good enough? Why are you not negotiating quickly? So, it seems that you are very nervous, very enthusiastic, very diligent, and very eager, advocating 'unconditional ceasefire', 'shortening the war time', 'reducing the people's suffering', and 'taking saving the people as the premise', while we, apparently, are not nervous, not enthusiastic, not diligent, not eager, 'delaying time and prolonging the war'. But wait, gentlemen in Nanjing, we will become nervous, enthusiastic, and diligent. The war time can certainly be shortened, and the people's suffering can also be reduced. Since you have agreed to use our eight conditions as the basis for negotiations, you will all have to work hard to implement these eight points. It may take you, us, all democratic parties, people's organizations, and the people all over the country several months, half a year, a year, or five years to complete. We have the right to order you to re-arrest Okamura. The eight points that the gentlemen in Nanjing are listening to are not abstract conditions, but have concrete content. In this short period of time, it is important for everyone to think about it. The people will forgive the delay for a while. To be honest, the people's opinion is that we must prepare well. This negotiation must be held. Whoever stops in the middle and refuses to talk is absolutely not allowed. Therefore, your representatives must be prepared to come, but we still need some time to prepare. We do not allow the time for negotiation to be determined by war criminals. Because we are now working on an important task with the people of Peiping to peacefully resolve the Peiping issue. People in Peiping, such as General Fu Zuoyi, are also participating in this work. However, according to the communique of your news agency, you have admitted that this work is being done correctly. This work not only designated a location for peace talks, but also set an example for the peace issues of Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Xi'an, Taiyuan, Gui Sui, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Kunming, Changsha, Nanchang, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Taiwan, and Hainan Island. Therefore, this work should be praised. Gentlemen in Nanjing, you should not show an insufficiently solemn attitude towards this. We are consulting with various democratic parties, people's organizations, and non-party democratic figures, including those in our region and those in your region, on the list of war criminals, preparing the specific content of the first condition. This list will probably be announced soon. Dear gentlemen in Nanjing, you know that our democratic parties and people's organizations have not yet had time to discuss and officially announce such a list. Please forgive us for this. The reason is that your request for peace talks came a little late. If it had been earlier, perhaps we would have been ready. But you are not without things to do. In addition to arresting the Japanese war criminal Yasuji Okamura, you must continue to arrest a group of civil war criminals. First, arrest the 43 war criminals mentioned by a CCP authoritative figure, Li Ming, on December 25th last year. You must arrest them quickly and prevent them from escaping. You must take full responsibility. If there is any escape, it will be regarded as aiding bandits and will never be tolerated. We believe that only by arresting these war criminals can we shorten the war time and reduce the people's suffering. The existence of war criminals for one day will only prolong the war time and increase the people's suffering." Finally, it stated: "Regarding other conditions, we will notify Nanjing next time."

### Stalin is Willing to Meet with Truman to Discuss the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty, Answering Four Questions from American Journalists

[TASS, Moscow, 30th] Stalin's answers to the four questions raised by Mr. Smith, European General Manager of United Press International, received on January 27th are as follows: (Question) Is the Soviet government willing to consider issuing a joint statement with the US government guaranteeing that the two governments have no intention of resorting to war against each other? (Answer) The Soviet government is prepared to consider issuing such a statement. (Question) Is the Soviet government prepared to jointly adopt measures with the US government designed to implement such a peace treaty, such as gradually reducing armaments? (Answer) The Soviet government can, of course, cooperate with the US government in adopting pioneering measures for gradual disarmament designed to implement such a peace treaty. (Question) If the US, British, and French governments agree to postpone the establishment of a separate West Germany before the Foreign Ministers' Conference is convened to review the entire German question, will the Soviet government be prepared to remove the restrictions imposed by the Soviet authorities on traffic to Berlin and the western occupation zones of Germany? (Answer) If the US, Britain, and France comply with the conditions stated in the third question, the Soviet government believes that the lifting of transportation restrictions will not be hindered, but it should be based on a tacit understanding that the transportation and trade restrictions implemented by the three countries should also be lifted simultaneously. (Question) Are you prepared to meet with President Truman at a mutually convenient location to discuss the possibility of concluding such a peace treaty? (Answer) I have stated before that I have no objection to a meeting.

[United Press, London, 31st] Most non-communist Europeans expressed skepticism about Stalin's statement, but Sweden quickly suggested that any Stalin-Truman meeting be held in the Swedish capital. According to sources close to the Swedish Foreign Ministry, Sweden is willing to arrange the Stalin-Truman meeting.

[Associated Press, Washington, 30th] Stalin's statement closely follows two important Soviet diplomatic actions: the Soviet government's publication of a white paper denouncing the North Atlantic Treaty and the Soviet ambassador to Norway's inquiry into whether the Norwegian government would participate in the treaty. Some people believe that Mr. Shi's remarks, consistent with those of the French and Italian Communist leaders, seem to be a peace offensive and should not be trusted without factual evidence.

[United Press, Washington, 30th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally said that Stalin's statement on US-Soviet relations is a significant event in international relations. He said that Stalin's statement of willingness to jointly guarantee with Truman to avoid war may indicate a new trend in international peace and harmony. "If this is his purpose, it will be welcomed by all who are concerned about peace and security and resolutely oppose aggression." House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom said that this statement cannot be completely ignored because this move will give the Soviet Union a propaganda victory. He said: "I do not agree to appease the Soviet Union in any way."

[Associated Press, London, 30th] British diplomatic circles today expressed surprise at Stalin's remarks that he did not object to meeting with Truman. A Foreign Ministry spokesman believed that the implications of this talk were worth studying. Others believed that Mr. Shi wanted to contact the Truman government more directly with Moscow, disregarding Britain and France, or to shift attention from the North Atlantic Treaty.

### The Soviet Union Attacks the North Atlantic Alliance, Accusing Britain and the United States of Creating a New War, Negotiations Among Seven Countries are Underway in Washington

[This newspaper's report] London, 29th broadcast from Moscow: The Soviet Union today released a white paper declaring to the world that the North Atlantic Treaty is part of a new war plan launched by Britain and the United States. The white paper condemned Britain and the United States for attempting to control the Far East, having no success in signing peace treaties with Japan and Germany, and pointed out that the North Atlantic Treaty conspired to overthrow the United Nations in order to achieve the goal of Britain and the United States' forceful control of the world.

The white paper said that the British, French, Dutch, Belgian, and Luxembourg Western Union is an integral part of this British and American plan. It also said that Britain and the United States are attempting to isolate the Soviet Union, undermine the United Nations organization, implement economic sanctions against the Soviet Union and its satellite countries, and attempt to launch a new war.

This Soviet white paper was released a few hours after the five Western European countries announced their agreement to establish a European Parliament.

[Associated Press, Washington, 30th] Although the negotiations on the North Atlantic Treaty have encountered increasing opposition from the Soviet Union, the United States has decided to proceed with all its strength. It is reported that Secretary of State Acheson held a meeting with various advisors yesterday, and it is expected that Mr. Acheson will soon meet with the ambassadors of Canada and the five Western European countries, and the full text of the treaty will be announced soon.

### Soviet Pressure on Norway, Northern European Defense, Negotiations Fail

[Associated Press, Oslo, 30th] The tripartite defense talks among the three Nordic countries, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, concluded today, and a communique was issued announcing that despite sincere efforts, a treaty basis had not been found. The failure of the negotiations came after the Soviet Union exerted pressure on Norway. The three countries originally had different dreams in the same bed. Norway advocated participating in the West, Sweden advocated neutrality, and Denmark's attitude was undecided. The negotiations dragged on for several months. Soviet Ambassador Afanasyev yesterday questioned Norway's intention to join the North Atlantic Alliance and whether it would allow Western countries to use its military bases, intending to force Norway to choose between the East and the West. This move led to the failure of the three-nation negotiations. It is reported that the Soviet Union did not make the same representations to Sweden and Denmark. Norway's reply will be presented.

### The Soviet Union is Drafting a New Plan for Arms Reduction

Will be Submitted to the Security Council for Discussion

[This newspaper's report] Lake Success, New York, 31st broadcast: It is reported that the Soviet Union is currently drafting a new statement on the United Nations world disarmament plan. This statement may be an important step following Stalin's announcement of the US-Soviet peace plan. According to well-informed sources, Soviet representative Malik is preparing to reopen the debate on the United Nations disarmament issue. The Security Council may convene a meeting within this biweekly period to consider this issue, at which time the Soviet spokesman is expected to speak first. United Nations diplomats unanimously expect that Malik's statement may be a prelude to the next step following the Soviet Union's call for a US-Soviet truce issued by Stalin.

### Greece Initially Reveals Atmosphere of Peace, Guerrilla Side Proposes Seven Negotiation Conditions, Government of Fu has Accepted Ceasefire Proposal

[TASS, Prague, 29th] According to the Electric News Agency: Free Greek Radio broadcast that the Provisional Democratic Government of Greece issued a message to the Greek people, especially to all soldiers and "loyal officers," and to all "loyal political leaders," calling for peace and putting forward conditions sufficient to stop the brutal civil war and ensure the national independence and sovereignty of Greece. The Provisional Democratic Government of Greece is willing to start peace talks and is willing to send a delegation to Athens if its proposed conditions are accepted. The conditions put forward by General Markos are as follows: (1) All foreign troops and military personnel must withdraw from Greek territory; (2) All treaties and agreements that infringe upon Greek national sovereignty must be cancelled, and foreign interference in Greek internal affairs must be stopped; (3) Before the terms of the ceasefire are agreed upon, the Democratic Army and the Royalist Army will each hold their original defenses; (4) An amnesty for political prisoners should be implemented without reservation by both sides; (5) All democratic parties should be guaranteed; (6) The equality of minorities should be ensured; (7) Political negotiations should be started in order to form a democratic government, and a general election should be held for this reason. The Provisional Democratic Government of Greece emphasized that it is willing to accept the results of a universal democratic election held in accordance with these conditions.

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 30th] Telegrams from Athens to foreign countries yesterday stated that the Greek government has accepted General Markos's proposal for an immediate ceasefire, which has caused quite a reaction in Greece.

### Five Western European Countries Decide to Establish a European Parliament, Italy will be Invited to Participate

[This newspaper's report] London, 28th broadcast: The official communique issued on the night of the 28th stated that the Western Union Consultative Council held a meeting in London for two days and decided to establish a European Parliament, which consists of a non-public executive committee and a public consultative conference. The Consultative Council decided to invite other European countries to jointly participate in the discussion on the establishment of the European Parliament, and Italy will be the first country to be invited to participate. The communique stated: The Western Union Consultative Council has considered the report on defense matters and exchanged views on certain political issues. Regarding the Palestine issue, it was unanimously agreed that the stage of de facto recognition of the Israeli government has now been reached.

[This newspaper's report] Washington, 29th broadcast: The US official expects that the establishment of the European Parliament by the Western Union will have a good response from the US side. It is said that this new development proves the determination of the Western countries to strengthen unity and cooperation, which is a prerequisite for the United States to continue to provide assistance.

### Italian and French Communists Oppose the European Federation Plan

[United Press, Rome, 30th] Italian Communist leader Togliatti warned the government on the 30th that his 2.5 million party members would fight against Italy's accession to the European Union and hinted that he would call for a special election on this issue.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th] French Communist Party Secretary-General Duclos said in a speech today that the European Federation plan drafted by the five signatories of Brussels is a tool of reactionary policies and a factor in war preparation, which is what the British and American war traffickers and their tails want. The Soviet Union's rejection of this kind of imperialist war policy is conducive to peace, and the people must rise up against this policy.

### Rusk is Appointed as US Assistant Secretary of State

### Vyshinsky Has a Nervous Breakdown

One theory is that his visit to Czechoslovakia has a special mission

[United Press, Prague, 30th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, who was rumored yesterday to be suffering from a severe nervous breakdown in a sanatorium in Carlsbad, was heard today to have recovered slightly and had left the sanatorium for several hours. (Moscow telecommunications did not mention Mr. Wei's arrival in Czechoslovakia or the news of his illness.) The servants in the hospital did not say where Mr. Wei went when he left the hospital today, but only said that he had not seen any guests. The Czech Foreign Ministry still said that it had not officially been informed that Mr. Wei had arrived in Czechoslovakia. It is rumored that Mr. Wei came here with the mission of creating disputes. It is said that Moscow believes that Czech President Gottwald's recent actions have failed to strictly adhere to his policies. One theory is that the Soviet Union asked him to allow some Germans to resettle in the Czech Republic, but Mr. Gao has refused directly. Although all the rumors have not been confirmed, many people believe them. There are also various rumors about Vyshinsky's illness. It is inconceivable what disease he is suffering from and why he came here. Mr. Wei once served as a cleansing prosecutor in the trial of anti-government factions, and his nervous system may have been affected as a result.

[This newspaper's report] The cost of various public utilities in this city has more than doubled due to the increase in the US exchange rate and the price of coal and oil, and the cost of living index has increased fivefold. In order to make up for the cost deficit, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau invited the heads of various companies to re-determine the new prices based on actual costs and submitted them to the mayor for approval. Water tap water (per cubic meter)

Gas (per degree of 100 cubic feet)

### Train and Ship Fare Increases: Transportation Costs Quadrupled, Shipping Industry Up 60%

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration received a telegram yesterday from the Ministry of Transportation, ordering that, effective today (February 1st) at 00:00, passenger and freight rates on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines be adjusted, with a general increase of 400%, five times the original rate. The new ticket price for the express train from Nanjing to Shanghai is 960 yuan for first class, 480 yuan for second class, and 240 yuan for third class. The new ticket price for the express train from Shanghai to Hangzhou is 580 yuan for first class, 290 yuan for second class, and 145 yuan for third class.

Passenger transportation on both lines continues to be extremely chaotic due to the government's relocation and military transport. The number of passengers on trains from Shanghai to Nanjing has decreased, while trains going from Nanjing to Shanghai and Shanghai to Hangzhou remain extremely crowded. Train delays have not only failed to improve but have worsened. The train schedule is essentially useless. As train cars are being moved south with the government, there is a temporary lack of circulation and an extreme shortage. The original daily train schedule is often suspended or temporarily reassigned, so in reality, passenger transportation on both lines is currently in a semi-paralyzed state, and it is difficult to expect improvement in the short term.

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Shipping Industry Association, in view of the recent soaring prices and the allocation of coal also rising by 150%, finds it difficult for shipping companies to maintain operations. The association's directors and supervisors, at a joint meeting last Friday, resolved to increase passenger and freight rates by 60% starting today. Furthermore, according to company representatives, even with the 60% increase today, it will still be difficult to maintain operations given the current price levels, even if we increased another 60%.

### Public Buses: Pre-Sale of Tickets at Terminals to be Trialed Starting Today

Passengers boarding at the above stations can purchase tickets in advance from ticket sellers stationed at each station while queuing. If the trial is successful, this method will be extended to other lines.

### Maritime Crew Groups Issue Declaration: Promoting Navigation in North China

Shipping Companies Also Decide to Send Ships

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The five senior merchant marine crew groups, in order to protect navigation rights and promote navigation in North China to prevent foreign ships from taking advantage of the situation, resolved at a meeting yesterday to issue a declaration. They demanded that the government unconditionally allow national ships to navigate in North China to demonstrate respect for national sovereignty. They requested that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) provide increased protection to national ships upon arrival. They also hoped that both authorities would avoid military transport as much as possible in the future to prevent misunderstandings and damages. They requested that shipping companies rise to the occasion, regardless of cargo availability or other difficulties, to provide ships and promptly initiate navigation to fulfill their undeniable responsibility. All crew members also resolved to contribute their utmost efforts to accomplish the heroic task of escorting the ships. It is reported that shipping companies have also decided to immediately dispatch ships to navigate to various ports in North China, and once customs clearance procedures are completed, the voyages can begin.

### Forced Landing? Or Other Motives? China National Aviation Corporation Passenger Plane Missing: Found at Jinan Airport

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] A China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) C-47 type XT-135 Shanghai-Qingdao flight disappeared on the 30th of last month while en route from Shanghai to Qingdao. It was later discovered in Jinan, which is under Communist control. The plane took off from Shanghai at 8:50 AM and lost contact at 11:00 AM. After the company authorities discovered this, they dispatched three planes, XT-42, 34, and 114, to search separately. At 4:00 PM, they finally found the plane parked in the Jinan airport. From the air, the plane number and markings were clearly visible, and the situation seemed quite intact with no one around.

The plane was piloted by foreign pilot Hassig, co-pilot Shu Zhitou, and radio operator Wang Qingyuan, with 17 passengers, including two foreigners. According to the company spokesperson, the passenger list could not be released because the company was closed for the holiday yesterday, and no one was working in the relevant departments. However, to his knowledge, there were no important figures among them, and most were going to Qingdao for business.

The company authorities are now waiting for developments and hope to receive news from Jinan so they can negotiate everything. As for the reason why the plane landed in Jinan, the company spokesperson declined to make any speculations. Jinan is more than 200 miles from Qingdao. Usually, the Shanghai-Qingdao route can fly directly along the coast, but it can also pass through Jinan. General speculation is that the plane may have encountered Communist aircraft or had Communist personnel on board, leading to a forced landing. As for mechanical failure, aviation industry insiders believe that if the plane had a problem, it would have been better to maintain course to Qingdao or return to Shanghai rather than landing in Jinan.

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Qingdao, 30th] A CNAC C47 XT135 passenger plane, carrying 17 passengers, including Chen Linwen, director of the Qingdao Naval Shipyard, departed from Shanghai for Qingdao at 7:50 AM on the 30th and disappeared en route. The Qingdao CNAC authorities immediately dispatched four planes to search separately. At 2:50 PM, the plane was found safely parked on the western part of the northeast runway of Jinan Airport. The search plane circled four times at a low altitude of 500 feet and observed that the plane was parked properly and without damage. Communist soldiers were covering it with black mats. The wings and the right side of the tail had already been covered. There were many Communist soldiers at the airport. According to CNAC personnel, the weather in East China today was excellent, and the plane should not have been forced to land, suggesting that there must be other underlying reasons.

### Previous Month's Lower Period Index: 88.47 Times. Two Types of Indices Will Be Compiled and Published in the Future.

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Shanghai Municipal Employee Living Expense Index Compilation and Review Committee held a meeting at the Municipal Government Conference Room yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, chaired by Statistics Director Chu Yifei. Representatives from the Federation of Labor Unions, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the Industrial Association, among others, attended the meeting. The chairman began by stating that there are many compilation agencies in the city, but the methods used and the prices adopted vary slightly, and coordination has recently been achieved. In the future, the index will use the index from the first half of January as a fixed base period, as the "August 19th" prices can only serve as a base price. Therefore, the index released today has two versions: (1) the old index, which still uses the "August 19th" prices as the base price, is 88.47 times. (2) the new index, which uses the first half of January as the base period, is 1.84 times. Starting in February, the old index will no longer be calculated. In the future, there will be two types of indices published: A. the fixed base period index, which uses the first half of January as the base period. B. the chain index (i.e., the comparison between two consecutive periods).

Employee Salary: Three Methods

Regarding the method of paying employees' salaries, the following three methods can be used, and the results will have no impact on the actual salary received. (1) For those who use the "August 19th" base salary, they will still use the old index to pay salaries, or multiply the new index by 48.04 times as the salary figure. (2) Change the base salary to the "August 19th" base salary multiplied by 48.04 times, as the base salary for the first half of January 1949, and then multiply it by the newly established fixed base period index to pay salaries (i.e., using the first half of January 1949 as the base period). (3) Starting in February, the chain index can be adopted, that is, the actual salary paid in the previous period is multiplied by the chain index.

Furthermore, in view of recent price fluctuations, which have severely affected employees' purchasing power, Chu proposed to the Bureau of Social Affairs to establish a wage-price review committee so that prices and wages can be more appropriately adjusted. To make the index more reasonable in the future, the price of the day before the index is published will also be included in the calculation. The monthly publication date will still be the 15th and the end of the month. After Chu's report, the committee members carefully reviewed and discussed the matter and unanimously approved it, signing on the index sheet. The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM.

The total employee living expense index and classification index for the second half of January, including both the new index and the old index, are listed separately below:

(A) Based on the prices of "August 19th" in 1937, the values of the total index and classification index (provisionally named "Old Index"):

Total Index...88.47

Classification Index:

Food Category...86.98

Clothing Category...75.62

Water, Electricity, Fuel, and Housing Category...96.17

Miscellaneous Category...90.10

(B) Based on the first half of January 1949

as the base period, the values of the total index and classification index (provisionally named "New Index"):

Total Index...1.84

Classification Index:

Food Category...1.98

Clothing Category...1.30

Water, Electricity, Fuel, and Housing Category...1.66

Miscellaneous Category...1.84

### One Time the Interest Rate Allocated as Handling Fee: Municipal Meeting Approved

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Regarding the case of revising the pawn interest rate and the request of the Pawnbrokers Association to waive the prohibited handling fee, the Bureau of Social Affairs submitted two resolutions from the previous municipal meeting: (1) forward a letter to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting that the capital amount of the pawn industry be re-specified. (2) Regarding whether the handling fee should be prohibited, the Bureau of Social Affairs shall convene representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Pawnbrokers Association to discuss the matter jointly. At yesterday morning's regular municipal meeting, the Bureau of Social Affairs forwarded a telegram from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that all pawnbrokers are willing to allocate a portion of the current pawn interest rate as a handling fee, which should not increase the burden on pawn customers, so it seems feasible. The case has been discussed and approved by the municipal meeting.

### Fire at Tongfu Grand Theater: Four Children Trampled in the Chaos

### Receiving Good News on New Year's Eve: Going Home for the New Year: Detained Students All Released

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The detained students Shi Jiapu, Chen Mingde, and 16 others were all released on bail on the afternoon of January 28th after a hunger strike and appeals, as well as efforts by university presidents and parents. They were released from prison on Lunar New Year's Eve after five months of detention, allowing them to reunite with their families for the New Year. At this point, of the large group of students arrested on August 27th of last year, all have been released except for Duan Ze of Tongji University, who is still in custody due to his six-month sentence not yet being completed.

These eighteen students were detained and interrogated by the Special Criminal Court on August 27th of last year on suspicion of being "Communist spies" and detained at the Penglai Sub-Bureau. Due to insufficient evidence, they were not prosecuted but were also not released. On December 24th of last year, the Special Criminal Court transferred the case to the Garrison Command for handling in accordance with the Martial Law. After five months in prison, they longed for home and, due to the long-term detention, their physical and mental health deteriorated. Therefore, they launched a hunger strike appeal on January 20th. Later, with the guarantee of university presidents and parents, they negotiated with the authorities and, after being persuaded, resumed eating on the 23rd while awaiting orders. After the university presidents and parents made petitions and repeatedly visited Mayor Wu, Mayor Wu agreed to release them immediately on the morning of the 28th. On the afternoon of the same day, all the students were released on bail. The Garrison Command transported them from the Penglai Road Police Bureau to the Garrison Command for release, where their parents picked them up and reunited for the New Year.

[Another Dispatch] Furthermore, three professors representing the Fudan University Faculty Association, Chen Guyuan, Chen Wangdao, and Pan Zhenya, brought a large number of candies to the Penglai Police Bureau on the morning of the 28th to visit the eighteen detained students, and also visited Chen Siwei, a professor at the China Industrial and Commercial Vocational School who was arrested in late November of last year, for a discussion of about half an hour.

### Collison Between Taiping and Jian Yuan Ships Sinks Both: Over a Thousand People Drown, Thirty-Eight Rescued

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] On the night before Lunar New Year's Eve, that is, at 11:45 PM on January 27th, the Taiping, a ship of the Zhonglian Company operating between Shanghai and Keelung, suddenly collided with the Jian Yuan, a ship of the Yiqun Company carrying goods from Keelung to Shanghai, in the waters near the Zhoushan Islands, more than 40 nautical miles from Shanghai. As a result, both ships sank. Only two of the 74 crew members on the Jian Yuan were rescued. Only 36 of the more than 1,000 crew members and passengers on the Taiping were rescued. This is another major tragedy this year following the Jiangya ship incident.

According to surviving passengers of the Taiping, the Taiping was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the morning of the 27th. However, a batch of steel bars weighing 600 tons had to be loaded and transported, which took a long time. After loading 150 tons, it was discovered that the deadweight had exceeded the specified waterline of the ship. At that time, the crew members requested that they stop loading, but the ship's business director insisted on loading 450 tons after all of the freight for the steel bars had been collected, and then the ship departed. The departure time was delayed until 4:15 PM.

### No Fog or Wind at Sea: Cause of Collision Unknown

Since the ship still wanted to arrive in Keelung before the scheduled time, it was traveling at a very high speed after leaving port and did not follow the prescribed route, but instead took a shortcut. According to the passenger, the Taiping arrived near the Zhoushan Islands at 11:45 PM. There was no fog or wind at sea, but it is unimaginable why it collided with the Jian Yuan, which was coming from the opposite direction. He recalled that in addition to the Taiping's excessive speed and incorrect route, the signal lights on the mast were also not lit. The Jian Yuan's route also did not seem to comply with the regulations. Therefore, the position of the two ships at the time of the collision was at a right angle. The bow of the Taiping struck the rear port quarter two-fifths portion of the Jian Yuan. Both ships did not sound their whistles prior to the incident. The Jian Yuan was brightly lit after being hit, and the crew members jumped into the water to ask the Taiping for help. The ship sank completely within 15 minutes. The Taiping was unable to quickly release the lifeboats, so it rescued two people with wooden planks. When it was discovered that the ship's own cabins were also taking on water, it turned back to a nearby small island at full speed. However, at this time, the ship was gradually tilting to the right and sinking. When the tilt reached about 40 degrees, the sound of the ship's engine stopped. Before the Taiping's hull took on water, all the passengers heard the noise and woke up, rushing to the top deck and shouting for help. When the bow gradually sank, a large ship was suddenly spotted one Chinese mile away, possibly attracted by the shouting. The ship shone a strong spotlight in the direction of the Taiping, but it quickly extinguished and continued sailing without coming to the rescue. According to the passengers' subsequent investigation, the ship seemed to be the Zhongxing ship sailing from Keelung to Shanghai, as its direction and time of travel matched the Zhongxing. After that ship left, the Taiping tilted even more. In less than half an hour, it finally capsized, and all the passengers on the top deck were crushed into the sea. Thirty-six of them were able to cling to wooden planks and boxes, drifting with the waves until 6:30 AM on the 28th, when an Australian warship arrived and rescued them one by one after receiving a distress call. All the other passengers have likely been buried at the bottom of the sea.

### List of Survivors of the Two Ships

The number of goods carried on the Jian Yuan was said to be only 2,000 tons of coal, plus 74 crew members. The Taiping registered 508 passengers and 124 crew members, plus about 1,000 people, including those who boarded without tickets ("yellow fish"). As of last night, it has been confirmed that three crew members of the Taiping were rescued: Zhang Chenglai, Zhang Haipeng, and Lu Ayu, as well as 33 passengers. The names of the others are unknown, their names are Wu Huikang, Li Rongqing, Gao Maonan, Zhu Dahua. Sa Bing, Qin Shouxi, Cai Meihua, Ye Liming, Chen Jinxing, Xu Xingdao, Mai Ziming, Tang Liuzi, Guo Jieke, Liao Nannan, Li Zhiwen, Lin Shibao, Wu Zichao, Guo Chaosheng, Lei Wensheng, Luo Wenlin, Luo Wenbing, Cao Changqiu, Rong Xiaobao, Zhou Yuanxiang, Hu Shangfu, Sun Fangzai (all male), Zhou Qixiu, Wang Caolan, Zhou Lanying, Lin Ahi (all female). The survivors of the Jian Yuan were Tang Ashu, a third engineer, and one fireman. Among the passengers who died, there were many well-known figures from Shanghai and Taiwan, or their families. However, the only ones who have been confirmed so far are the wife and daughter of Liu Zirun, manager of the Southeast Daily in Shanghai, and the wife, daughter, and four brothers of Qi Jiechen, a tactical instructor at the Army Training Command.

Families of the Victims Petition the Authorities

After the tragedy, the families of the victims of the Taiping formed committees in both Taiwan and Shanghai to handle the aftermath. The number of family members registered in Taiwan is already 240, and the number registered in Shanghai is more than 500. Representatives of the families of the victims in Shanghai, Chang Zichun, Wang Yi, Gong Yunbiao, Zhou Guohua, Zhu Minghe, Deng Erqian, Wu Zongji, Mao Zhaowen'e, etc., went to the municipal government to meet with Mayor Wu, but there was no result. Today, they will each send four representatives from both Shanghai and Taiwan to petition the municipal government, the municipal council, and the security authorities, demanding a thorough investigation of the truth of the accident and urging them to handle the aftermath. In addition, in response to the demands of the families, Zhonglian Company also dispatched the "Haichuan" ship yesterday afternoon to carry more than 100 family members to the site of the accident for inspection.

Report and Appeal to All Sectors Yesterday

In order to make the truth clear to all sectors, the bereaved families held a reception for reporters at Zhonglian Company yesterday afternoon and reported several points: (1) According to various facts, the collision was caused by negligence of duty by the Taiping authorities in good weather, which is unprecedented in the history of navigation in our country. (2) Both the Taiping and Jian Yuan ships were overage, and the life-saving equipment was also incomplete. The Jian Yuan had an accident near Taiwan and had not yet been repaired before it sailed. (3) After the accident, the "Taiping" would send a distress call, but the Shanghai maritime authorities and Zhonglian Company never sent ships to rescue them. Finally, they said that they would issue several appeals to all parties: (1) demand that the authorities of the two ships immediately conduct rescue operations, search for survivors, and salvage the dead. (2) In addition to being liable for all legal responsibilities, the company authorities should immediately provide relief to the families of the victims. (3) The company authorities should promptly announce the exact location of the accident of the two ships. (4) The maritime authorities should strengthen measures to prevent accidents and strictly rectify navigation ethics. (5) Hope that the authorities will thoroughly investigate the truth of the accident and publish it as soon as possible.

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Taipei, 31st] After the Taiping ship accident, most of the passengers' families were in Taiwan. A committee for the aftermath has been organized, and ten representatives have been sent to Shanghai to investigate the truth. The families believe that the accident was caused by careless driving and that the company should be responsible. They have petitioned the police station to request the provisional attachment of the property of Zhonglian's Taiwan branch and that the manager be released on bail and put forward the terms of compensation.

### Only One of the National Bank's Six Employees Survived

### French Tram Once Stopped: Soldiers Attempt to Board, Open Fire with Guns, Injuring Person

[Report from Our Newspaper] At 3:25 PM yesterday, a French-operated tram (car number 106) heading west reached Dongxin Bridge station. A dozen or so soldiers of an unknown unit attempted to board. However, the car was already packed with passengers. As driver number 365, hearing the bell signal to proceed, was about to continue onward, the soldiers became dissatisfied. One of them drew a gun and fired three shots at the tram. Fortunately, the passengers dodged effectively, and only one person was injured. In the chaos, the soldier who fired and his companions took the opportunity to escape. The tram immediately stopped service and reported the incident to the company.

### The Transforming Gansu-Sichuan Border: Zhuoni in the Tibetan Region: A Sideline Account of Commander Yang Fuxing's Reception

[Report from Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 26th (Airmail)] Perhaps it was due to the similar ages of the host and guests, or perhaps it was because the host belonged to a different ethnic group, but this reporter found Commander Yang Fuxing's reception fresh and meaningful. Everyone casually discussed everything about the area of the Tibetan people, who numbered more than one hundred thousand and were engaged in both farming and herding, as if discussing exotic news: marriage, currency, area, population, livelihood, customs, religion, politics, and even the ancestral practice of kneeling in greeting, all became targets of everyone's questions. Through this series of questions, everyone satisfied their curiosity, as if they had taken a trip abroad. Most valuable was Mr. Yang Shenghua's systematic introduction.

Why Commander Yang Fuxing is named Yang

He first explained the origin of the name "Che Ni." Originally, the Zhuoni region was densely forested, and rich in Masson pines. The Tibetan word for Masson pine is "Zhuoni." The Tibetans used "Zhuoni" as a characteristic to refer to this area. The neighboring Han people inherited this name, forming the name of this place that everyone knows today. The Tibetans here migrated from Tibet. Their first ancestor was named Xie'erde. He later became the local chieftain, inheriting the position for generations. It was not until the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty that the emperor summoned him and bestowed the surname Yang. This is the origin of Commander Yang's surname, Yang.

The hereditary chieftain has existed for twenty generations

During the Qing Dynasty, Commander Yang's ancestor was granted the hereditary title of Vice Commissioner. In successive disturbances, he always stood on the side of protecting the people and maintaining local stability. In 1936, Commander Yang's father was killed by local ruffians colluding with Han people from a neighboring area. At that time, the central government sent Mr. Tian Kunshan to handle the matter. Because the local people firmly opposed rule by outsiders, they unanimously supported Commander Yang Fuxing to inherit his father's position. The central government accepted the public opinion and appointed the young Yang Fuxing as Security Commander. This hereditary chieftain system has existed for twenty generations. Commander Yang often encourages himself to seek ways to maintain their glory and achievements, and dares not slack off for a moment. Every few months, they come to Lanzhou to stay for a while in order to understand the external situation and learn all new knowledge. They are working hard to adapt to the new era, and are trying to improve education and life. Although the current situation does not allow them to seek new happiness, they can only passively seek to reduce the suffering and burden of the people.

Zhuoni District uses both political and religious governance

Finally, he talked about the relationship between politics and religion in the Zhuoni district and how it differs from the Tibetan region of Xiahe. The local customary law is this: if the Tusi (chieftain) has one son, then he simultaneously holds the great power of both political and religious affairs. If there are two sons, the elder son will hold political power and the second son will hold religious power. If there are further sons, they become heads of hundreds or thousands of households. As for the difference between Zhuoni and Xiahe, the political power is larger than religious power in Zhuoni, while Xiahe is the opposite, where religious power is supreme, and political power is below religious power.

There are forty-eight banners and more than ten elementary schools

The Zhuoni district now has forty-eight banners, each banner with from two to three hundred to five to six hundred households. There are currently more than ten elementary schools. Times have finally progressed. Students in those schools no longer need to be forced to attend like corvee laborers, but the people's habits and consciousness are still the same as before. When they meet Commander Yang, they still kneel on the ground. If they refuse to kneel, it will be considered that they look down on him.

A major transformation of the era has produced a new understanding

In any case, Commander Yang, who has just returned from training in Nanjing, knows that the times are changing every day, and progressing every day. When the reporter asked if his younger brother, Danzhu Hutukgang, could also get married, he smiled and said, "Not now, maybe in ten years it will be possible." From this one sentence, people can already see that this young commander has no plans and doesn't even want to cling to the past. In this major transformation of the era, it is truly commendable that a descendant of a Tusi can have this kind of understanding! (Han Guocui)

### Guilin Spring Welcoming Melody

— Our newspaper reporter Liang Yushan

[Report from Our Newspaper, Guilin, 25th] After the President's New Year's Day address, the whole country was ecstatic. Everyone had a common wish and belief. The long-silent mountain city suddenly became active. The east called for peace, and the west echoed with peace. Today there was a peace conference, and tomorrow there will be another peace conference, making this southern corner seem like the center of political gravity. The members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan, National Assembly members, and members of the Kuomintang, Youth Party, and Democratic Socialist Party, as well as representatives from various public opinion organizations such as the provincial and municipal assemblies who are staying in Guilin, all unanimously promote peace.

Indeed, the prices of goods these days are very satisfactory. Only two days after the news of the President's retirement was released, rice, which had been 500 yuan per dan, plummeted to 300 yuan. Gold retreated from 12 to 11.10, retreating steadily. The yuan fell sharply from a high of 170 to 140 yuan. Shops are busy selling goods, believing that peace will be realized and prices will fall. The only exception to the price declines this week is haircuts. As the abolished lunar new year approaches, "rich or poor, get a haircut for the new year," so the price is raised.

The sun has been scorching in recent days, with a gentle breeze, and the temperature has risen from zero degrees to above fifty degrees. Pedestrians are lightly dressed, wearing only shirts, as if it were early spring. Shops are busy decorating their facades, and everyone is playing a melody to welcome spring.

Since the President's retirement, the atmosphere of peace has become stronger. Legislative member Lin Hu and others staying in Guilin expressed their opinions, praising the President's retirement as far-sighted, wise, and decisive. Vice President Li's assumption of the arduous task of maintaining the situation meets popular expectations and is believed to be successful. Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members and National Assembly members responded to the organization of the Peace Promotion Association by Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members and National Assembly members in Nanjing, while at the same time exchanging opinions with various agencies and people's organizations in the city. They all believed that the President's retirement had a great impact on war and peace, and the situation has since turned around, with the distance between the two sides gradually closing. The trend of the times, the unanimous demand of the people, and the desire for peace are bound to be realized; it is only a matter of time. Therefore, they jointly telegraphed President, Vice President, and the two Presidents of the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong and Sun Tong, urging both sides to immediately lay down their arms and send representatives to Beijing to negotiate peace with people from the various opposition parties and representatives from the provincial and municipal councils, to negotiate everything in order to safeguard national rights, protect the freedom of the people, and achieve economic equality. In short, all measures should be based on the power of the people.

Paying attention to national affairs by ordinary people shows where the people's hearts lie. In recent days, there have been groups of readers looking at wall newspapers on the streets and at the doors of newspapers. Libraries and all places with newspapers have been filled with people awaiting news of peace, praying for the arrival of the gods of peace and freedom.

### Families of Conscripted Civilian Ships Come to Chang to Request Relief

[Report from Our Newspaper, Wujin, 26th] Taixiang received an order from the Jiangfang Department last month to requisition ten civilian ships in the territory, each with a load of more than fifteen tons. The ten households whose ships were requisitioned, including Wang Kun Da and others, had all their ships assigned to the river defense chain. As a result, the families of all ten ships have nowhere to live and are in dire straits. On the 25th, they collectively walked from the river defense area to Changzhou and submitted a petition to the county government, requesting relief. The county government deeply sympathized and immediately ordered the Chamber of Commerce to estimate the value of the ships, totaling 815 dan of rice, and ordered them to find ways to raise funds. The person in charge of the Chamber of Commerce agreed to pay off all the funds within the abolished lunar new year. The method of raising funds is to be proposed by all industries.

### Jiangsu Provincial Cadre Training Class Student, Wang Zhengjiang, Executed for Fraud

[Report from Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 31st] Wang Zhengjiang, a student in the Jiangsu Provincial Military Cadre Training Class, was executed in Xinfeng on the 30th for forging rice coupons and defrauding property.

### Amidst the Evacuation: Chatting Casually about Fuzhou

— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Zheng Shizhu

[Report from Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 25th (Airmail)] Since the New Year in 1941, Fuzhou has been like a nouveau riche, panicking and at a loss. This time, the central government has stepped up its evacuation efforts, but the capacity of Taiwan and Guangzhou has already been saturated, so it has to retreat to the more moderate cities in the southeast. In history, Fuzhou has always ranked third or fourth rate. Some people said that Shanghai's civilization is half a century behind New York, and that Fuzhou is fifty years behind Shanghai. Although this statement may not be entirely accurate, it is probably not far off. However, since the recovery of Taiwan, which is closely related to Fujian, Taiwan's position has become increasingly important, giving rise to new value to the adjacent mainland. In the future, the center of gravity of war and peace will definitely not be in the southwest. Fuzhou is located between Beijing, Shanghai, Hebei, and Guangzhou, and should be a new stronghold. The Communist Party once broadcast that it would capture Fuzhou in May, which shows that great minds think alike, and the Communist army has also noticed the importance of this growing small city in the near future.

Evacuation plan is like an arrow leaving the bow

To remedy the shortcomings of inland transportation, the Fujian-Jiangxi Railway is said to be starting soon, and highways will be actively improved, but this is not a quick fix, and it is not easy to talk about in the short term. Under the slogan of "being able to fight before talking about peace", the government's evacuation plan is like an arrow leaving the bow, and the advance personnel of the Joint Logistics Headquarters and the Ministry of National Defense have also arrived one after another. At this time, the chairmen of the three provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangdong were replaced. Zhu Shaoliang, as the Pacification Director of Fuzhou, concurrently served as the head of Fujian Province, in coordination with Chen Cheng in Taiwan and Xue Yue in Guangdong.

Mixed families, chaotic and cramped

So far, almost all usable and rentable houses in Fuzhou, from the city to the suburbs, have been occupied. The families of government and military agencies have used every possible means to move into housing that can barely accommodate them. Even now, many families are still living a mixed family life on the floors of evacuation stations. A chaotic and uneasy mood generally envelops the hearts of every displaced person. Single people, with nothing to do during the evacuation period, spend their days wandering the streets, while those burdened with families are busy with the division of labor, arranging the most basic and simple living space. This is an awkward picture.

Prosperity opportunities, expressing welcome

Amidst this severe housing shortage, there is a lovely episode: a coastal town about seventy kilometers east of Fuzhou openly welcomes the relocation of evacuation agencies or larger schools, citing beautiful scenery and convenient transportation, showing that some people cherish this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for prosperity.

Peace talks, hoping for something

The people of Fuzhou are simple and old-fashioned. Not many men wear neat suits. The situation today seems to have changed slightly. Even more women are wearing suit pants than men who used to wear suits, although their number is still far less than that of the soldiers in grass green uniforms on the streets. However, the bright colors of the clothes they brought from Beijing and Shanghai are more than adequate.

The call for peace talks is very loud, and people are looking forward to a new situation. Some people are calling for the suspension of work at the Yixu Airport in Fuzhou, hoping that the agencies will temporarily stop evacuating, as abnormal prosperity and chaotic relocation will only cause adverse consequences.

### Detailed Account of the Wuxi Bloodshed: Military Officer's Unrequited Love Leads to Murder of Mistress; Opera Singer Zhang Yuyan and Husband Tragically Killed; Perpetrator Flees to Nanjing, Still at Large

— Our Correspondent Shi Wuwei

[Our Wuxi dispatch, 26th] Since winter began, although martial law has been in effect in Wuxi, reports of robbery and theft continue unabated. Furthermore, a series of bloody incidents has occurred, significantly impacting social order. Yesterday morning, at 4:00 AM, during the martial law period, two more homicides occurred. One was in the southern suburbs, where watchman Guo Yulin was killed by thieves. The other was a crime of passion. A young military officer, taking advantage of his ability to move freely while wearing martial law attire during the curfew, was able to act deliberately and escape without hindrance. This officer, named Zhang Jiming, had become deeply infatuated with the Peking Opera actress Zhang Yuyan, to the point of developing possessive desires. Unfortunately, love cannot be forced upon one party. After repeated threats elicited no response, the officer, in despair, conceived the intention to kill, using a handgun to fatally shoot his beloved and her romantic rival.

**Beautiful Actress, Military Officer Pursues**

The deceased Zhang Yuyan was 19 years old and the adopted daughter of martial arts actor Zhang Yuting and Zhang Shaoyan. She began learning opera at the age of nine and was betrothed to Zhao Qingsheng (whose brother is Zhao Songqiao), a student of Yuting, at the age of eleven, although they were not often together. After the victory [end of WWII], Zhang and his daughter joined the "Chunqiu Opera Troupe" sponsored by the 58th Army, performing in Nansuzhou. At the time, Yuyan's beauty and artistic skills were considered top-notch, and she was very popular with audiences. Zhang Jiming, then the head of the Political Affairs Brigade of the Traffic Police Headquarters stationed in Suzhou, saw Zhang dressed up and was struck by her celestial beauty, immediately harboring desires for her. He tried various methods, initially becoming friendly with Yuting, then offering embroidered cushions as gifts, and finally, sparing no expense, he organized the "Universal Opera Troupe," appointing Zhang Yuting as the director. Zhang, lured by fame and fortune, resigned from the Chunqiu Opera Troupe and led Yuyan and others back to Nanjing to perform on the central stage of the Victory Hall in Jieshou Hall.

**Warm Concern, Love Blossoms**

Before long, Jiming also resigned from his position in the Suqian Political Affairs Team and went to Nanjing to dedicate himself to the development of the Universal Opera Troupe. After a month of performances, Yuyan suddenly fell ill with a lung ailment. Jiming felt his opportunity had arrived and encouraged her to stop performing. He first persuaded Yuting to take the troupe back to Wuxi, then sent Yuyan to the hospital for treatment. Jiming showed her thoughtful care day and night, and from this, love blossomed. After recovering from her illness, she went on a honeymoon trip to Wuhu with him, living together as husband and wife. Until March of last year, at Yuting's repeated urging, Zhang and Yuyan came to Wuxi and performed under the name of the Universal Opera Troupe at the China Opera House on Huiquan Nongqiao. A month later, they returned to Wuhu. Yuting and Zhao Qingsheng and their families remained in Wuxi. Due to difficulty finding housing, they temporarily stayed at Room 11 of the Dongxin Hotel, with Zhao living alone in Room 12. Later, Yuyan also came to Wuxi alone at the end of December, living with Zhao, and then performed at the Middle East Opera House, holding the leading role.

**Losing Sight of Her, Love Drifting Away**

However, Jiming never saw his beloved return from then on, longing for her until his eyes were dry. He visited Wuxi three times to urge her to return to Wuhu, but Yuting forcefully prevented him by making excuses. Zhang made fruitless trips back and forth. He then sent three more letters urging her, but they were ignored. By the time the fourth letter arrived, its wording revealed his anger and resentment. Yuting, realizing that it was impossible to hide the truth, replied to Jiming, directly telling him that his young daughter Yuyan had been betrothed to Zhao Qingsheng since childhood, and that he should no longer think of Yuyan in the future. After receiving the letter, Zhang realized that his money and love had all drifted away, and the intention to kill arose from this.

**Actress Faithless, Seeks Revenge from Afar**

Several days ago, Jiming came to Wuxi from Nanjing, staying at the Taishan Hotel. After secretly investigating the location of Yuyan and her husband, at around 4:00 AM yesterday morning, carrying a six-inch Browning pistol with a loaded chamber, he went directly to the Dongxin Hotel under the cover of martial law. He knocked on the door and entered, only to find Yuyan and Zhao embracing and sleeping together, which ignited his jealousy. Without a word, he raised his gun and fired at them, each of them being shot three times. One bullet struck Yuyan in her right breast, and the bullet did not exit, killing her instantly. Zhao suffered four gunshot wounds in his large intestine and stomach, and his life was in critical danger. By the time Yuting heard the noise and rushed out, Jiming had already calmly gone downstairs and escaped. He immediately reported to the security authorities and sent the injured to Dahua Hospital for treatment. He was pronounced dead at 8:00 AM on the 26th. After daybreak, he filed a formal report with the local district prosecutor, requesting an autopsy, accompanied by the local neighborhood head. It is reported that the perpetrator is currently serving in the Capital Garrison Headquarters, and the city defense department has dispatched personnel to track him down and arrest him.
