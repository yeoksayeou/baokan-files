[Report from our Ningbo Correspondent on the 22nd] President Chiang arrived in Ningbo from Xikou at 9:00 AM on the 22nd. He then proceeded to the Lishe Airport and flew to Hangzhou on the Meiling Special Plane.

[Report from our Hangzhou Correspondent on the 22nd] President Chiang arrived at Hangzhou Jianqiao Airport by plane from Xikou at around 11:00 AM on the 22nd. Acting President Li Zongren, He Yingqin, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Qun, Cheng Qian, Wu Zhongxin, Xu Yongchang, Gu Zhutong, Tang Enbo, and the chairmen of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces had all arrived at Jianqiao in advance to greet him. None of the dignitaries entered the city after arriving. Martial law has been declared along the road from Jianqiao to the Hangzhou city area. Furthermore, Zhejiang Chairman Zhou convened an emergency meeting on the evening of the 21st and decided to establish the Hangzhou City Defense Headquarters. Emergency martial law was declared in Hangzhou on the 22nd. The police force has been increased during the day and martial law will be implemented one hour earlier in the evening.

[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] Acting President Li, Premier He Yingqin, Zhang Qun, and Bai Chongxi, four important officials, took the Chuiyun Special Plane from Nanjing to Hangzhou at 10:45 AM on the 22nd for important consultations with President Chiang. Gan Jihou, Cheng Siyuan, and many others accompanied them. Acting President Li and Premier He stayed in Hangzhou for four hours and then flew back to Nanjing from Hangzhou by special plane at 5:30 PM in the afternoon. Cheng Siyuan returned with them.

[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] Central Committee member Zhang Daofan arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 21st. Representing the Guangzhou Central Executive Committee, he paid respects to the elders in Nanjing and conveyed the Central Executive Committee's hope for unity within the party to support Acting President Li and preside over future war efforts. After completing his mission, he returned to Shanghai on the 22nd.

[Report from our Fuzhou Correspondent on the 22nd] Confirmed information: President Chiang will visit Xiamen in the near future.

[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] The Information Office of the Executive Yuan issued a public statement on the 22nd stating that: In order to strive for overall peace and provide the people with an opportunity to recuperate, the government dispatched a delegation to Beiping to negotiate a cessation of hostilities and a restoration of peace with the Communist Party. After more than two rounds of negotiations, no agreement was reached. In the end, the Communist Party put forward a so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement" with a deadline for response. The entire document, consisting of eight articles and twenty-four clauses, was entirely the disposition of a conqueror towards the conquered. Its purpose was to use force to eliminate the national army, create terror to destroy the people's freedom and social order, and at the same time launch a full-scale attack and forcibly cross the Yangtze River. At this point, it has become clear to the world that the Communist Party has no sincerity in seeking peace and is willing to destroy peace, expand the war, and become the enemy of the nation and the people. Today (the 22nd), President Chiang arrived in Hangzhou from Xikou, and Acting President Li and Premier He flew from Nanjing to Hangzhou to meet with him. They solemnly discussed the current situation and the government's future policies, and unanimously decided on the following four points: (1) Regarding the Communist Party issue, the government will resolutely fight to the end for the people's freedom and national independence. (2) In the political arena, unite with all democratic and freedom-loving people in the country to fight together. (3) In the military field, Premier He will concurrently serve as the Minister of National Defense, unifying the command of the army, navy, and air force. (4) Take emergency and effective measures to strengthen the unity of the Chinese Nationalist Party and the connection between the Party and the government.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The President issued the following orders on the 22nd: (1) Xu Yongchang, the Minister of National Defense, is to be appointed exclusively as the President of the Army University. (2) He Yingqin is specially appointed as the Minister of National Defense concurrently. (3) The Minister of National Defense commands the national army, navy, and air force. (4) The Chief of Staff is to be changed to the Chief of Staff for the Minister of National Defense. The current organizational law of the Ministry of National Defense will be amended separately.

### Capital Evacuated of Officials Within Six Hours, Government Urges Envoys to Move to Guangzhou Again

[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] After the Chinese Communist Party issued the order for a general offensive, the situation in the capital became increasingly tense and serious. In addition to Acting President Li and Premier He returning from Hangzhou, other important officials have left Nanjing one after another. Starting on the morning of the 22nd, special planes carrying legislators to Guangzhou, Guilin, and Taiwan took off one after another. In the afternoon, several planes carrying government officials left Nanjing. The government's emergency evacuation work is accelerating and is expected to be completed within one or two days.

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 22nd] Within six hours after 10:00 AM on the 22nd, almost all officials had been evacuated. Airplanes at Nanjing Airport, loaded with the families and luggage of high-ranking officials, constantly took off from Nanjing to Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and other southern Chinese cities. In addition to Acting President Li and Premier He, important officials from the Guangxi clique, including Interior Minister General Li Hanhun, flew to Hangzhou. Li Zongren's wife and the families of other Guangxi officials flew to Guilin. Other ministers flew to either Shanghai or Guangzhou. Only Education Minister Hang Liwu remained in Nanjing. It is rumored that he will leave Nanjing on an American Embassy plane in an emergency.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 22nd] Residents here did not show any signs of panic on the 22nd. A curious crowd even gathered on the riverside in the morning to watch the artillery battles north of the river. Business here is proceeding as usual. Some shops were closed due to slow business. Movie theaters remained open. The sound of silver dollars jingling on the streets could still be heard, and scalpers were still active.

[Our Report] China National Aviation Corporation dispatched fifteen planes yesterday, and Central Air Transport Corporation dispatched eight planes yesterday, to Nanjing to assist government departments with emergency evacuation matters.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd] In January, the government moved its offices to Guangzhou from February 5th due to the threat to the capital from the Communist army. It also notified the embassies of various countries in China, requesting them to move with them. Representatives of various embassies came to Guangzhou at that time, but most of the envoys and their staff remained in Nanjing. Now that the Communist army has relaunched its offensive and Nanjing has become a war zone, the government, in order to ensure the safety of envoys from various countries and their staff, specifically notified the embassies again on the 22nd, urging them to move to Guangzhou as soon as possible, and telegraphed our embassies abroad to make the same representations to local governments.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 22nd] Foreign diplomatic missions here received a notice from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 22nd, advising them to evacuate to Guangzhou. According to reliable sources, it has been learned that foreign diplomatic missions have decided to remain in Nanjing. It is generally believed that this decision was made at a secret meeting held by various diplomatic missions on the morning of the 22nd. A few days ago, major Atlantic Treaty nations held a secret meeting and decided to remain here even in the midst of the crisis of Communist occupation.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The government's various Yuan, Ministries, and Commissions had previously decided to move their offices to Guangzhou. A joint office was established by the various Ministries and Commissions of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing to maintain liaison. However, recently, due to the Chinese Communist Party expanding the war and invading south across the river, the government has decided to abolish this office and move all offices to Guangzhou.

### Bao Jing'an Arrives in Shanghai and Says, Although the War Situation is Quite Serious, It Is Not as Critical as Imagined

[Our Report] Bao Jing'an, Director of the Information Office of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday afternoon. It is said that the situation in the capital is still good. Although the war situation is quite serious, it is not as critical as imagined. Although the situation in Digang and Jiangyin has changed, the government is still determined to defend the river. The evacuation of various Yuan and Ministries from Nanjing does not mean a change of capital. According to the decision of February 5th, the government will conduct business in Guangzhou from now on. In principle, the government should not remain on the front lines. Bao confirmed that Acting President Li and Premier He will come to Shanghai in the coming days. Premier He will stay in Shanghai for several days to give instructions. The entire Presidential Office will not move to Shanghai, but some important officials within the Presidential Office will come to Shanghai in the coming days.

### Yan Xishan Arrives in Shanghai, Taiyuan Still Firmly Held

[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] Yan Xishan, Director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, flew from Nanjing to Shanghai by civil aviation plane at 3:00 PM on the 22nd. Yan told reporters at the airport that Taiyuan was fighting well and that more than 10,000 bandits had been annihilated on the morning of the 22nd. After arriving in Shanghai, he would continue to direct Taiyuan's military affairs by telephone.

[Our Report] According to a broadcast by the Chinese Communist Party radio station at 10:10 PM last night, the National Army in Taiyuan is still engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist army. The rumor that it has already fallen is not accurate. Xu Xiangqian and Zhou Shidi, the commander and deputy commander of the Communist army attacking Taiyuan, and Political Commissar Luo Ruiqing, are still using the Xinhua Radio Station to continue broadcasting the "Letter to All Citizens in Taiyuan City," urging them to lay down their weapons and stop resisting. This proves that the walls of Taiyuan City are still being firmly defended by the National Army. According to the Chinese Communist Party, the troops attacking Taiyuan this time are composed of a mixture of the three major field armies of Northeast, North China, and Northwest, and the offensive is extremely fierce. It is said that although there are breaches in the strongholds around the suburbs of the city, the urban area is still being firmly defended by the National Army.

### Presidents of the Legislative and Control Yuans Arrive in Shanghai, Yu Youren Speaks with a Heavy Heart About the Current Situation, Legislators in Shanghai to Hold Discussion Meeting Today

[Our Report] Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan, Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, Finance Minister Liu Gongyun, and Weng Wenhao arrived in Shanghai by special plane from Nanjing at 5:00 PM yesterday. Yu met with reporters in the evening and spoke with a heavy heart about the current situation. He said that he would stay in Shanghai for a few days before going to Guangzhou. Yu admitted that a peaceful resolution to the national crisis was hopeless. As for the future evolution of the war situation, he was not a military man and could not give an answer. As for future diplomatic relations, this was originally a part of the peace talks. As of now, on the surface, he does not see anything that is beneficial to the government. The newly appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs is still on his way home, and Vice Minister Ye is often in Guangzhou, and he has little contact with him, so he cannot give a detailed analysis of this.

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] More than two hundred legislators have arrived in Shanghai recently. Ye Suzhong, Liu Zanzhou, Li Yu, Yang Yifeng, Xie Chengyu and other thirty-three members have jointly launched a discussion meeting at 3:00 PM on the 23rd at the New Life Club at 184 Tongfu Road to exchange opinions on the current situation and discuss the issue of going south.

[Another Dispatch] Liu Zhe, Vice President of the Control Yuan, led more than sixty members of the Control Yuan and more than ten staff members to Shanghai by three special planes on the afternoon of the 22nd. The remaining members of the Control Yuan in Nanjing will come to Shanghai successively. The Control Yuan has sent personnel to Shanghai to negotiate for plane and ship seats to go to Taiwan and Guangzhou.

### Legislative Yuan Scheduled to Continue Meeting in Guangzhou in Early May

[Report from our Guangzhou Correspondent on the 22nd] More than twenty legislators from Nanjing arrived in Guangzhou on the 22nd, including Vice President Liu Jianqun. It is said that the Legislative Yuan's general meeting will continue to be held in Guangzhou in early May.

[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] Zhu Jiahao, a member of the Political Council, and a group of legislators flew to Guangzhou by special plane on the morning of the 22nd.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd] Legislators in Guangzhou held a symposium on the morning of the 22nd, attended by more than eighty members. Xu Yuanquan was elected as the chairman. First, Li Dong announced the statement on the current situation and telegrams to express condolences to the officers and soldiers on the front lines, and then discussions began, all of which were amended and passed. It was also agreed to establish a "Preparatory Committee for the Resumption of the Legislative Yuan in Guangzhou," and Xu Yuanquan and other twenty-one people were elected as executive members of the preparatory committee to actively carry out the preparatory work for the resumption of the meeting.

### Communist Troops Actively Moving in Henan and Hubei

[Report from our Hengdian Correspondent on the 22nd] Military Information: Communist troops in southern Henan and eastern Hubei are still actively moving, and most of the National Army defending the outer perimeter of Wuhan has arrived at their designated positions. According to a military spokesman, no matter how strong the opponent's pressure is, the National Army will not easily abandon the important strongholds around Wuhan (including Huangpi and Xiaogan). Furthermore, when the reporter drove to the National Army positions near Xiaogan this morning for inspection, he saw soldiers of a certain division digging trenches beside the railway. During breaks from work, they were helping farmers cut grass in the wheat fields and vegetable plots. The morale of the Huaizhong front line and the people's hearts were vastly different from the past. After learning of the news of the Communist army's general offensive, their hope had obviously turned into anger.

[Report from our Hankou Correspondent on the 22nd] River defenses in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River are tightening. Two naval cruisers sailed from a certain place to patrol near Jiujiang last night. Furthermore, the Hubei River Police Department has recently been ordered to concentrate all boats moored north of the Yangtze River to the south bank, and the pontoons on the Hankou riverside must also be moved to Wuchang.

### US Authorities in Japan Prepare to Send Planes, Ships, and Manpower to China, US Embassy Urges American Nationals in Nanjing to Evacuate

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 22nd] It was learned here today that U.S. military officials in the Far East Command in Japan are now preparing to take any action, in accordance with orders from Washington, to protect American citizens in China. Reliable sources said that "if necessary," the U.S. will dispatch planes, ships, and manpower from Japan to China to protect U.S. interests. However, it was carefully pointed out that this action is not expected to be taken at the moment, but U.S. military leaders here will be ready to provide the necessary assistance at any time.

U.S. and Allied officials here are now closely watching the rapidly changing situation in China. Most qualified observers believe that it will not be long before the area under MacArthur's command becomes the only remaining important listening post outside the Iron Curtain in this part of the world.

At the same time, many Japanese feel that the Chinese Communist Party's bold actions (referring to the shelling of British warships on the Yangtze River) will be echoed by actions from the Japanese Communist Party. The Japanese Communist Party now has unprecedented strength in the Japanese Diet and is gaining momentum due to the surge of the red tide in Asia. If the Chinese Communist Party achieves complete control of China, the U.S. outposts in Japan, Korea, and the Ryukyu Islands will become even more important, as the Chinese Communist Party's control of all of China will bring the Communist Party to the edge of the U.S. outer defense line in the Pacific.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 22nd] The U.S. Embassy notified all American nationals in Nanjing on the 22nd to immediately use commercial transportation to leave Nanjing unless they are "forced to remain here to deal with any emergency situation." The embassy further warned that it cannot provide emergency protection or engage in evacuating Americans in an emergency, as the U.S. naval ships originally stationed in Nanjing have been transferred to Shanghai, and the Marine Corps guard has been reduced to only enough to temporarily protect internal security.

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] A State Department spokesman said on the 21st that the department had not received any reports of Americans injured in the fighting along the Yangtze River or elsewhere in China. According to recent statistics, there are 4,023 American nationals in China, and government officials are closely monitoring all possible reports.

### Hunan Facing a Critical Juncture, Provincial Government Holds Meetings for Days, Pacification Headquarters Issues Temporary Martial Law Decree

[Report from our Changsha Correspondent on the 22nd] The general situation has taken a sharp turn, and southern Hunan is facing a critical juncture. Cheng Qian has repeatedly declared "avoiding war and adapting to changes," but some generals, such as Li Mo'an and Huang Jie, disagree with Cheng's intentions. Local people are engaged in a "peace" movement, which is actively underway. The provincial government had important talks on the evening of the 21st, but without results. Negotiations continued on the 22nd, but the content has not yet been revealed.

[Report from our Changsha Correspondent on the 22nd] The Changsha Pacification Headquarters issued a temporary martial law decree at 3:00 PM on the 22nd. The curfew will be implemented from the 22nd.

[Report from our Changsha Correspondent on the 22nd] Cheng Qian previously invited Tang Boqiu, Speaker of the Hunan Provincial Assembly, to Dong'an, urging Tang to come to Changsha in the coming days to discuss countermeasures with Chairman Cheng. If necessary, Tang will come out to seek stability in Hunan.

### Sino-Italian Treaty of Friendship Signed

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Security Department Partially Moves to Suzhou and Songjiang

[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] Since Twelve Mile Reach was lost on the night of the 20th and Guazhou and Six Mile Reach were abandoned, the threat of the Communist army to Zhenjiang has increased. The Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Provincial Security Command have therefore ordered a partial move to Suzhou and Songjiang for official business.

### Presidential Office and Executive Yuan Buildings Completed in Guangzhou Suburbs

[Report from our Guangzhou Correspondent on the 22nd] The Presidential Office and Executive Yuan buildings, located in the eastern suburbs of Guangzhou, have been completed and are expected to be moved into next month for official business.

### War Extends to South Bank of Yangtze River, Communist Army Crosses Yangtze from Jiangyin and Flees South, National Army Withdraws from Pukou, Six Mile Reach, and Guazhou

[Report from our Wuxi Correspondent on the 22nd] On the night of the 21st, Communist troops secretly crossed the river from Ligan and other places in Chengxi and came south. The situation in Shuangshanzhi, Xiaoshan, and other places in Chengdong is unknown. Wei Xiyan, the magistrate of Cheng County, left Cheng at 2:00 PM on the 22nd to go to Wuxi and then to Shanghai. All senior officials of the county government are in Wuxi.

[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] According to confirmed information, Dai Rongguang, the commander of the Jiangyin Fortress, led his troops of about two regiments and formally defected to the Communist Party on the night of the 21st. At the same time, he secretly aimed all the fortress guns at four naval warships anchored in the river, preventing them from attacking. As a result, more than 3,000 Communist troops from the Communist Party who crossed the Yangtze River along the south of the river from Jingjiang on the north bank smoothly crossed the Yangtze River on the night of the 21st under this situation. According to news at 6:00 PM on the 22nd, the Communist troops fleeing south have been divided into several groups, one of which has approached within 20 miles north of the railway between Wujin and Wuxi. The National Army is encircling and attacking them. According to reports, the main reason for Dai's defection was his corruption, which had been credibly accused, so he defected to the Communist Party.

[Report from our Wujin Correspondent on the 22nd] Last night, there was a loud boom of artillery fire north of Wujin all night long. A large number of Communist troops secretly crossed the river at Taohuagangkou on the border between Wujin and Cheng County. They were discovered by the local garrison and subjected to fierce gunfire. Most of the ships were sunk, and a group of about 2,000 people took advantage of the darkness to flee to the south bank and flee to Xutang, Shishu, Huangtu and other places. Local Communist forces also joined in the reception. On the morning of the 22nd, the situation in the north of Wujin was quite tense. After the National Army urgently dispatched troops to encircle and suppress them, about 200 people were captured separately in Panshu and other places in the afternoon, and the rest were wiped out. The National Army suffered slight damage. The search is continuing, and order in the city is as usual.

[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] Tonight, artillery fire in Nanjing has continued all night long, and clear machine gun fire can be heard intermittently, but the citizens remain calm as usual. Puzhen on the north bank was automatically abandoned after midnight.

[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] The National Army in Pukou had completely withdrawn to the south bank before dawn on the 23rd. Furthermore, at about 1:00 AM on the morning of the 23rd, more than 500 Communist troops from Huaizikou, east of Pukou, attempted to forcibly cross the river to Xiaguan by boat, but were repelled. Furthermore, the Zhaoshangju near the Sun Yat-sen Wharf in Xiaguan is already within the range of Communist machine gun fire, and the National Army is retaliating.

[Report from our Zhenjiang Correspondent on the 22nd] It is also learned that it was widely rumored on the morning of the 21st that the situation in Yangzhong was unclear, and Heshangzhou was occupied by the Communist army last night.

[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] After three days and nights of fierce fighting, the National Army Wang Zuohua's troops in the Six Mile Reach bridgehead opposite Zhenjiang took the initiative to withdraw to the south bank at 10:00 AM on the 22nd after completing their mission. Furthermore, the Guazhou bridgehead west of Six Mile Reach was also abandoned at 11:00 AM on the same morning. Thus, except for Huaizikou, all the bridgeheads on the north bank east of Pukou have fallen into the hands of the Communist army.

### MacArthur Pays Attention to Our Situation, Believes That the Final Outcome of the War Is Very Important to the US

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 22nd] It was learned on the 22nd that General MacArthur is closely watching the situation in China and believes that the final outcome of the resumption of the war is very important to the United States. MacArthur believes that the extent of the China problem deserves consideration by U.S. officials when formulating global policies. It is said that MacArthur believes that many Americans pay too much attention to Europe and ignore the equally explosive situation here. Reliable sources say that MacArthur firmly believes that (1) China is of great strategic importance to the United States, (2) When properly considered, it can be thought that China contributes to the stability and progress of the future American way of life and is very beneficial to the United States. (3) The United States should not deny its long-standing friendly relationship with China

[Report from our Wuxi Correspondent on the 22nd] Due to the serious situation, an earlier curfew was imposed here starting on the evening of the 22nd, and traffic was cut off at 10:30 PM.

[Report from our Wuxi Correspondent on the 22nd] The county government, under orders, requisitioned fifteen large buses from Wuxi, Xicheng, Xihu, and Jiangnan companies to drive to Changzhou for concentration. Furthermore, the Xicheng long-distance bus only goes as far as Qingyang, and the Xicheng direct bus has been suspended and is only for military use.

[Report from our Suzhou Correspondent on the 22nd] The city defense department was ordered by the First Pacification Zone to advance the curfew time in this city to 10:00 PM starting on the 23rd. Stores and theaters will also close one hour earlier. Furthermore, the 296th garrison division has been transferred to another location, and the city defense duties have been changed to be directly under a certain unit of the Provincial Security Command. According to Commander Li, who spoke to reporters, at this time of military urgency, any gangster who takes the opportunity to spread rumors and disrupt public order will be killed without mercy.

[Report from our Suzhou Correspondent on the 22nd] Long-distance buses from Suzhou to Changshu, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and other places partially resumed service on the 22nd, but the number of trips will depend on the number of buses. Small cars on each line are running as usual.

[Report from our Suzhou Correspondent on the 22nd] In order to rush to build bunkers and strongholds, the First Pacification Zone urgently telegraphed the county government on the 21st to requisition 5,400 laborers and 98 male and female workers. After receiving the order, the county government has convened a meeting of township chiefs to quickly gather them.

[Report from our Wuxi Correspondent on the 22nd] A fire broke out outside the north gate of Jiangyin on the evening of the 22nd.

### Communist Troops Crossing the Yangtze in Central Anhui Capture Datong and Qingyangkou, National Army Dispatches Strong Troops to Complete Bag-Shaped Position

[Report from our Nanjing Correspondent on the 22nd] The south bank bridgehead position established by the Communist army in central Anhui on the south bank of the Yangtze River, from Sanshan in the east to Tongling in the west, has expanded to the west of Datongzhen since the night of the 21st, and its front is about 160 miles wide. Datongzhen has also fallen. It is reported that in recent days, as many as three armies, about 70,000 people, have crossed over to the south bank at night. The so-called 300,000 people in the Xinhua News Agency broadcast is obviously an exaggeration. According to what was learned this afternoon, the Communist troops have penetrated Qingyangkou, and a group has penetrated to an area more than 20 kilometers west of Xuancheng between Nanling and Jing County. The National Army has dispatched strong troops and completed a bag-shaped position, hoping to eliminate them in one fell swoop.

### How to Suppress Grain Prices in Shanghai

In recent decades, commodity prices have been rising daily, seemingly without end. Financial authorities are exerting all their efforts to tighten credit in order to suppress the rising tide of prices. However, apart from financial commodities such as gold, silver, foreign currency, and stocks sometimes falling back, the rise in grain prices has never slightly receded. Taking last week's situation as an example, the price of white japonica rice in the South Market rose by more than 2.1 times, in the North Market by 2.3 times, and the price of Lao Che Noodles flour also rose by more than 2 times. This week, due to the turbulent situation and the breakdown of peace talks, the resumption of war has caused grain prices to rise even more sharply, especially rice, which is close to a state of chaos. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau stipulated that the price of white japonica rice should not exceed two million yuan per picul, but rice merchants were unwilling to sell their goods on the market because the cost was not enough, and the market was at a standstill, with retail prices reaching as high as three million two hundred thousand yuan. How can these ordinary people not feel the threat of "white terror"! People depend on food as their heaven, and the people's food problem is the root of everything. If we allow it to rise naturally without restraint, the consequences will be unimaginable. We hope that the municipal authorities and security organs will quickly come up with a solution to thoroughly resolve this most difficult food problem.

We have studied the reasons for the recent surge in food prices, which include the following: (1) High prices in production areas, with costs exceeding the price limit. For example, rice prices in Wuxi and Zhoupu have reached two million yuan per picul, and the demand is very strong, so owners are waiting to see what happens, making transactions difficult to initiate. (2) The Communist side has brazenly ordered a general offensive, attempting to forcibly cross the Yangtze River. The war has gradually shifted from the north bank of the Yangtze River to the south, causing public unrest and a rush to store rice and grain, which has invisibly greatly increased the demand for rice and grain, and prices have also risen accordingly. (3) In the past, the city's rice was purchased from Wuxi, Wuhu, Sichuan, Hunan, and various places near the city. However, at present, the Yangtze River shipping is interrupted, and rice from Sichuan and Hunan cannot be transported to Shanghai; after the rice source in Wuhu—the counties in the Chaohu Lake basin—changed hands, it is fundamentally impossible to supply the city any longer. At the same time, a large army is gathering along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line, and the supply of rice in the Wuxi area naturally cannot be as abundant as before. Moreover, the amount of rice produced in the suburbs of this city is limited after all, and what's more, the garrison in this city has suddenly increased recently, and the burden of food has become heavier. (4) General commodity prices are rising in a competitive manner, and grain is a necessity, so grain prices are unwilling to fall behind. In addition, the current period is the spring plowing season when the old and new crops are not yet connected, and there is a lack of rice and grain everywhere, which has led to a sudden rise in grain prices.

Judging from the above-mentioned inhibitory factors, it can be said that the vast majority are affected by the situation and people's minds. Now, to curb the rise in grain prices, the first step is only to start with stabilizing people's minds. To stabilize people's minds, some of the stored grain in the authorities' "Three-Month Grain Storage Plan" should be released to temporarily meet the urgent need and stabilize market prices. Secondly, the limit for household rice allocation should be relaxed to meet the actual needs of each person per month. As long as the supply is guaranteed monthly, rice prices can be stabilized. Thirdly, it is also important to dredge the source of food. In today's situation of sluggish domestic transportation and the urgent need for military food, it is best to directly find ways to purchase from Siam, Annam, and other places as a precaution. Although 120,000 piculs of U.S. aid rice arrived in the city the day before yesterday, it can only be used as a short-term supply. Now is the beginning of the spring famine, and the situation in the future will be even more difficult. Therefore, we hope that the authorities will quickly continue the "Grain Storage Movement". In addition, the current authorities' food conservation movement is also very important, such as eating mixed grains or eating more porridge and cakes. With as many as six million people in this city, "accumulating sand into a tower," the amount of food that can be saved must be considerable. As for cracking down on grain merchants' profiteering or restricting the quantity of purchases, although it has some impact on grain prices, it is not a fundamental solution.

Our country has always been a country that "establishes the nation on agriculture," and "people depend on food as their heaven" is a time-honored saying in our country, which shows the importance that rulers have always attached to the food problem. Originally, people's demand for food is indispensable for a single day, so the impact of food on people's livelihood is significantly greater than that of any other commodity. What's more, in order to suppress commodity prices, the cost of food prices (labor) has to first curb the unreasonable surge in grain prices. Only in this way can we stabilize social order. Otherwise, if the authorities allow the natural development of grain prices, it will affect public security and easily shake people's minds. The military authorities will announce today that the city has entered a state of war, and they should take practical and easy-to-implement emergency measures on how to suppress commodity prices.

### Communist Army Shelling of British Warships: Britain Still Maintains a Cautious Attitude; Commonwealth Conference Considers it an Important Issue

[Central News Agency, London, 21st dispatch] The headline news in the evening editions of the local newspapers is still the incident of the British warships being attacked on the Yangtze River, but they all maintain a cautious attitude. Up to now, the government's attitude and the actions it has taken are limited to assisting the "Amethyst," a stricken vessel. At a press conference today, when reporters asked the Foreign Office spokesman about this matter, he declined to comment. After repeated prodding, the spokesman finally said: British warships do not have treaty rights to navigate on Chinese inland rivers, but they have obtained the consent of the Chinese government. When reporters asked whether the Communist Party commanders should have been notified in advance that British warships should know that they were already in the war zone, the spokesman said he did not know, but he also said that British warships have frequently traveled in the area since October last year, and the Communist Party must know that they are British warships. Regarding the news published in local newspapers that the British Consulate in Beiping has protested to the Communist authorities on the matter, the spokesman also refused to confirm it. At the same time, the Navy Department issued a statement at noon today stating that the HMS London and the HMS Black Swan could not approach the "Amethyst" due to heavy enemy fire. However, the statement also said: "Discreet measures are being taken to establish contact with enemy forces between the "Amethyst," the "London," and the "Black Swan" in order to ensure a smooth passage." The same statement also said: "The HMS Belfast and the HMS Constance are also sailing to Shanghai because they are needed to perform tasks in the area." However, this statement contradicts the Navy Department's next statement, which said: "The Belfast has not yet left Hong Kong."

[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st dispatch] The news that Communist artillery fire struck four British warships in the Yangtze River, killing 43 people and injuring 52, has shocked London. The Foreign Office was unable to confirm the news from China today, saying that Ambassador to China Steven had ordered the British Consul in Tianjin to protest to the Communist authorities about this "serious incident." Local diplomatic observers believe that this protest is tantamount to de facto recognition of the Mao Zedong government, and the United Kingdom does not intend to grant such recognition to the Communist Party at present, which is one of the reasons why British officials believe that the Yangtze River incident is difficult to resolve on the spot.

[Associated Press, London, 21st dispatch] The incident of the Communist army shelling British warships on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has been regarded as an important issue at the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference being held here. According to sources directly related to Southeast Asian affairs, they believe that the Communist army deliberately attacked British warships in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River for two reasons: (1) to force all foreign warships to withdraw from the Yangtze River; (2) to make the Asian people realize that the Communist Party has sufficient power to repel Western countries.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st dispatch] According to sources close to the White House, President Truman's meeting with defense officials today focused on the Yangtze River incident of British warships being "shelled by the Communist army."

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 22nd dispatch] A British occupation army spokesman said on the 22nd that the army's air force in Japan is ready at any time, should the army receive an order to rescue British warships attacked by Communist artillery fire in the Yangtze River. The spokesman emphasized that the army has not yet received instructions.

[This city dispatch] Local British authorities denied yesterday's report by a foreign news agency that "Royal Air Force rocket combat aircraft attacking Malayan rebels have been put on standby to take possible action against the Communist army that shelled British warships on the Yangtze River." It is claimed that this report is completely inaccurate.

### The Artillery Used by the Communist Army Was Obtained from the Japanese Kwantung Army

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 22nd dispatch] Well-informed sources here announced today that the artillery used by the Communist army to shell British warships was mostly obtained from the Japanese Kwantung Army. The Kwantung Army's 105mm caliber artillery is equipped with armor-piercing shells and tank-killing shells, which are the same as those that hit British warships. Its maximum range can reach 20,000 yards. The weight of the armor-piercing shell is unknown, but it is known that its firing speed is 2,500 feet per second. The Communist army entered the Northeast after the Soviet army defeated the Kwantung Army and obtained a large amount of ammunition and equipment. As far as is known here, the United States has never supplied the National Army with this military hardware.

### British Newspapers Point Out that the Communist Side's Attack is a "Blatant Act of Aggression"

[Associated Press, London, 21st dispatch] The Conservative Party's Daily Mail said on the 21st that the Communist Party's attack on British warships on the Yangtze River was a "blatant act of aggression." The front-page editorial said: "Those killed are victims of murder. Britain must retaliate and demand punishment." The Mail asked: "How dare the Chinese attack our warships?" This kind of action would have been inconceivable even a few years ago. To find the answer, let us look at Singapore. The echoes of the fall of Singapore in 1942 still reverberate around the world, and its impact is still felt. A country that is weak and unwilling to exercise its rights is not respected in this world. We have said many times that might is still a reliable thing.

### The Yangtze Incident is Discussed in the United Nations Lounge

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 21st dispatch] In the United Nations lounge at Lake Success today, the shelling of British warships on the Yangtze River and the resumption of the Communist army's offensive were the main topics of conversation. People from all walks of life in the United Nations, including the British, expressed the opinion that Britain has little chance of bringing the Communist army's shelling case to the Security Council or the International Court of Justice in The Hague, just like the incident where Japan laid mines in the Straits of Science, which later damaged British warships. Although the shelling occurred in the area ruled by the Nanjing government, the Nanjing government cannot be held responsible. Therefore, people close to the British delegation believe that the British government will first find out who is responsible. If it is clear that the Communist army opened fire, the British government seems to be going to lodge a strongly worded protest to the Communist authorities. (Please refer to page 4)

### A New Experiment in Reforming Chinese Characters: Zhang Zhongchuan Creates "Zhong Characters"

Illiterate People Can Learn 4,000 Characters in Three Months

[This newspaper's Lanzhou, 22nd dispatch] The "Zhong Characters" invented by Anhui scholar Zhang Zhongchuan, after more than 20 years of research, have been completed, and he has written a book entitled "Suggestions for Zhong Characters," about 50,000 words, which will be submitted to the government for research, adoption, and promotion. "Zhong Characters" are a new experiment in the reform of Chinese characters, similar to Latinization, but with convenient, fixed, significant, and artistic conditions, so they are easy to read, easy to write, and easy to remember. They are more advanced than Latinized Mandarin and phonetic symbols. People who do not know a single character can learn 4,000 characters in three months by reading "Zhong Characters," which is extremely effective in eliminating illiteracy.

### Chennault Flew to America is Incorrect

### Xinjiang Commodity Prices Plummet: Affected by Rumors of the Imminent Opening of Sino-Soviet Trade; Newly Minted Silver Coins Will Be Available on May 1

[This newspaper's Lanzhou, 22nd dispatch] It is reported that commodity prices in Xinjiang have recently plummeted, affected by rumors of the imminent opening of Sino-Soviet trade. Old-style gold scales in Dihua are 50 silver yuan per tael, and green frog cloth is only 5 silver yuan per bolt. Grain prices in southern Xinjiang, such as Kashi and Yarkand, are even lower, only 5 jiao in silver coins per 100 catties.

[This newspaper's Lanzhou, 22nd dispatch] It is reported that Xinjiang's minting of silver coins is proceeding as planned, and they are expected to be available on May 1. After the new silver coins are circulated, in addition to issuing silver coin subsidiary currency at the same time, gold yuan and new provincial currency will still be used as usual.

### U.S. Senator Nolan Proposes Setting up a Joint Congressional Committee to Investigate U.S. Far East Policy; Truman Does Not Comment on the Situation in China

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st dispatch] Republican Senator Nolan proposed in the Senate on the 21st to establish a joint congressional committee to investigate the United States' Far East policy. The committee will be composed of five representatives from each of the Senate and the House of Representatives to investigate the United States' Far East policy. The committee will be composed of five representatives from each of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The investigation funds are limited to 500,000 yuan. It is claimed: "The purpose of this move is to allow the American people to learn the truth and correct mistakes to the extent possible, so as not to be too late. Even at this moment of our meeting, the Communist army is crossing the Yangtze River and entering non-communist areas." Nolan accused the Secretary of State of recently writing to Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, opposing the 1.5 billion aid to China plan, which is a betrayal of non-communist China. It is claimed: "This kind of statement is tantamount to dismantling the stage for the Chinese National Government." It is also remembered that before World War II, the United States sold kerosene and scrap iron to Japan, and as a result, it was attacked by Japan, which shows that the State Department's foreign policy is not without errors. If the entire China falls into the hands of the Communist Party, Burma and French Vietnam, and even India, will fall behind the Iron Curtain. Once the entire Asian continent is controlled by the Communist army, it will be extremely difficult for Japan to maintain its freedom. If the United States does not abandon Japan at that time, it will only have to make Japan permanently dependent on the United States militarily and economically. The situation in China is bleak, I also admit, but its bleakness is not as bad as when the British army was defeated in Dunkirk in the early days of World War II. If the United States had adopted a defeatist attitude at that time, Britain would have been unable to support it, and the entire Europe would have fallen under the Nazi iron hooves at this moment.

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st dispatch] McKee, Chairman of the newly established China Emergency Committee, denounced the State Department's publication of the amount of U.S. military aid to China on the 21st. After meeting with Deputy Secretary of State Webb, he told reporters that the Chinese government had only issued receipts for 105,400,000 yuan in U.S. aid. According to Acheson's statement on the 20th, U.S. military aid to China after the victory was 1 billion yuan. McKee said, "We believe that the United States has a large number of single-shot rifles and light equipment that are not suitable for Europe, which may change the situation in China."

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st dispatch] President Truman was unwilling to comment on the situation in China on the 21st. However, according to the President's press secretary, Ross, the State Department is constantly reporting to the President on the developments in the Chinese civil war. Ross also said, "The President regularly receives reports on various developments in foreign countries, but as of now, he has not received any special reports on the situation in China."

### The U.S. Policy Towards China is a Dismal Failure

Howard Newspaper Editorial Claims

[This newspaper's dispatch] New York, 22nd broadcast: An editorial in the Howard newspaper chain said that the State Department's policy towards China was a "dismal failure." The editorial said: If the Truman administration's policy towards China has nothing to hide, then it should humbly accept Senator Lander's proposal to demand that Congress conduct a comprehensive review of U.S. policy towards China. We should do everything we can to save this crisis. The editorial also said: The United States adopts an open bipartisan policy towards Europe, while decision-making on Asian issues is kept secret for fear that Congress and the public will learn the details, which is the style of totalitarian countries, not the attitude that the United States should have.

Pan Zhuangfei is the Deputy Commander of the Zhijiang Garrison, and Qianyang was recovered at dawn on the 20th.

### Acheson Attends Senate Foreign Relations Committee; Explains US Military Aid Plan; Requires $1.45 Billion in Funds; Includes Expenses for Aid to Greece and Turkey

[US Information Service, Washington, 21st] Secretary of State Acheson submitted a $1.45 billion military aid bill to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today. This figure of $1.45 billion accounts for approximately the total amount of US military aid, including military aid to Greece and Turkey for the 1950 fiscal year. According to Acheson's statement to the committee, military aid to the signatory nations of the North Atlantic Treaty will amount to $1.12 billion, including the transfer of equipment and surplus materials and the shipment of raw materials from the United States. The remaining $320 million will be allocated to Greece and Turkey. According to Senator Connally, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the committee will begin discussing the North Atlantic Treaty on the 28th. The President will formally present the military aid bill at the conclusion of this discussion. Before this, the committee will temporarily refrain from discussing the military aid bill.

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] According to Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the total amount of funds for aid to Greece and Turkey, countries outside the Atlantic signatory nations, is $320 million. The Philippines may also receive a small amount of grants. If the military aid plan is passed, it will be inseparable from US foreign policy. The Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to discuss the full text of the North Atlantic Treaty next Thursday. The treaty must be passed by a two-thirds majority in the Senate to take effect.

[United Press, Washington, 21st] Definite indications revealed on the 21st that the US government does not intend to request military aid to China in this session of Congress. This revelation came as Secretary of State Acheson submitted a request to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for $1.13 billion in military aid to the North Atlantic Treaty nations and $320 million in military aid to Greece and Turkey. This plan is called the "Comprehensive Military Aid Program for 1950." When announcing the request of the Economic Cooperation Administration, the government stated that the aid programs for Greece, Turkey, and China would be submitted to Congress later. Although the announcement on the 21st apparently excluded military aid to China, additional reconstruction aid may be proposed later.

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Republican leaders and others believed on the 22nd that the information given to Congress regarding the $1.45 billion plan to assist in arming Europe and other free nations against Communist aggression was not yet sufficient. Senator Taft, the Republican leader in the Senate, stated that Secretary of State Acheson had only given Congress another figure. He advocated a "complete break" with the proposed military aid plan. Taft, a Republican policy planner, stated that Congress's requirements cannot be satisfied solely by cost estimates. He stated that before Congress handles the approval of the Atlantic Treaty, it must first know all the details of the military aid plan.

### Commonwealth Conference Holds First Meeting; Nehru Attends and Reports; Proposed a Solution to the New Relationship Between Britain and India

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 22nd Broadcast: It is learned that the solution proposed by India regarding the issue of how it will maintain relations with the Commonwealth after becoming an independent republic includes the following points: (1) Deleting the word "British" before the title "Commonwealth"; (2) The Commonwealth organization should be flexible in order to accommodate republican states; (3) After the Commonwealth organization is changed, the title of "Dominion" should be abolished; (4) The Republic does not recognize the British monarch as the supreme authority, but acknowledges its special status as the first citizen; The Republic may respect resolutions concerning Commonwealth affairs, but on the principle that its domestic or foreign sovereignty is not hindered.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] The British Commonwealth Prime Ministers began their first plenary meeting today to begin searching for a new formula to allow India to continue to maintain relations with the British Commonwealth. Leaders and politicians from Britain, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, India, Palestine, and Ceylon will deal within a week with new issues that could completely change the future Commonwealth relationship.

The representatives of the countries concerned drove to No. 10 Downing Street this morning to attend the first round table meeting. One hour before the meeting, Prime Minister Attlee convened a meeting of key cabinet members. This meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers is a closed door meeting.

### Attlee and Nehru Hold Secret Talks for One and a Half Hours; Differing Opinions Among Prime Ministers on British-Indian Relations

[Reuters, London, 21st] Prime Minister Attlee has held individual talks with various Prime Ministers in the past two days, and today he held a separate secret talk with Indian Prime Minister Nehru for 90 minutes. Special telephone lines have also been installed at the hotels where the various Prime Ministers are staying. The main purpose of this meeting is to find a formula that will allow India to continue to cooperate with the British Commonwealth without compromising its future independent republic status. Several possible formulas have been proposed, but India and other participating countries do not have preconceived notions. The status of the British monarch in the Commonwealth will also be a major issue. Some countries believe that the British monarch is an indispensable link between the Commonwealth countries, but others believe that the link based on the British monarch is no longer acceptable to them. How to reconcile these two opinions is one of the main tasks of this meeting. This morning, Prime Minister Attlee held a garden party at his official residence to entertain the Prime Ministers, and at noon the Prime Ministers entered Buckingham Palace to attend a banquet hosted by the British King and Queen. This meeting is scheduled to continue for about a week.

### Attlee and Churchill to Secretly Discuss National Defense Affairs; Churchill Drafting a Memorandum

[British Information Office, London, 22nd] Secret consultations between the government and the opposition party on national defense affairs are expected to be held in the middle of next month. Opposition leader Churchill is currently drafting a memorandum to be submitted to the Prime Minister, in which he will present the opinions of himself and his colleagues on the various needs of Britain's armed defense under the current situation and in the future. During the talks, Attlee will likely be accompanied by Defense Minister Alexander and the three heads of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Churchill will be accompanied by either Eden, Stanley, or Lord Salisbury. This matter was mentioned in the House of Commons on March 3. At that time, the Prime Minister stated in his reply that Churchill had not yet arranged a date for the meeting with him, but that he was prepared to receive Churchill at any time. The next day, Churchill accepted the invitation, but the talks were postponed due to Churchill's trip to the United States.

### Royal's Resignation Approved; US Hastens Search for Successor; Bruce Transferred to US Ambassador to France

[US Information Service, Washington, 21st] President Truman has accepted the resignations of Secretary of the Army Royal and US Ambassador to France Caffery.

The President told reporters today that Bruce, who served as the head of the Economic Cooperation Administration's French branch in the past year, will succeed Caffery, but the successor to Royal has not yet been determined.

When asked whether there would be any other changes in the defense organization, the President replied that he did not anticipate any major changes in the near future.

Caffery will return to the United States for another assignment. He has been serving in the diplomatic field since 1911 and has been the US Ambassador to France since 1944.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st] Well-informed sources believe that the current Assistant Secretary of the Army Gray will be promoted to Secretary of the Army. Gray owns several newspapers in North Carolina. Rumors of Royal's impending resignation have been circulating for months. According to the correspondence released by the White House, Royal requested to resign in early January and reiterated his request before the end of February. On April 1, Royal sent another letter to the President declining his retention, and on April 21, the President accepted his request. Royal will return to practicing law after leaving office.

[United Press, Washington, 21st] According to Royal, there was no public conflict between him and President Truman, but he has never been able to reconcile with the President's policy of eliminating racial discrimination in the military. The conflict in opinions between Royal and the new Secretary of Defense Johnson has also become increasingly apparent recently.

### Soviet Writer Fadeyev Criticizes the Atlantic Treaty; Accuses the US of Building a Military Base Ring Around the World

The Soviet Union's chief representative, the famous writer Fadeyev, addressed the conference, saying that he did not believe that war was imminent, but that war had become a possibility due to the arms race of Western countries. He also said that the atomic bomb cannot be regarded as a defensive weapon, its role is to destroy cities and unarmed civilians. Fadeyev also said: The Atlantic Treaty is obviously dividing the world into two opposing blocs. The day these military blocs are formed is the day that war has entered the preparatory stage. Just open a world map and you will know that the United States has built military rings all over the world, forming a threat to world peace.

### Violation of Treaty Issues; Hungary and Romania Reply; Fails to Satisfy the US

[US Information Service, Washington, 21st] Earlier this month, the US government sent a note to Romania, accusing the country of violating the provisions of the treaty concerning human rights. The US government has now received a "completely unsatisfactory" reply. The State Department said that the US has also received Hungary's reply to a similar note, and this reply is also equally unsatisfactory. The United States is now awaiting a reply from Bulgaria, the third Balkan country and former German satellite state. After Bulgaria submits its reply, the US government will consult with other signatories to the treaty for further action. The notes from the US and Britain to the governments of the three countries listed facts of violations of the treaty and accused the countries of deliberately taking various measures that directly violated the treaty. The notes requested that remedial action be taken and that the US and Britain be notified of such action. The notes also stated that the US and Britain would not accept a reply that this was purely an internal matter. Since the Soviet Union (one of the three important signatories to the treaty) has not taken consistent action with the US and Britain, it will not consult with the Soviet government on this matter unless the efforts of other signatories fail.

### On the Issue of Disposing of Former Italian Colonies; US and Soviet Representatives Engage in Heated Debate; The US Consistently Opposes Handing Over to UN Trusteeship; The Soviet Union Accuses the US and Britain of Attempting to Use Them as Bases

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 21st] During today's debate on the issue of former Italian colonies at the UN Political Committee, a dispute arose between the US and Soviet representatives. US Representative Dulles declared that the United States "believes that African land cannot be handed over to countries attempting to prove that the communist form of society is the only form." Dulles was responding to the accusations of Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko that Britain and the United States were obstructing the Soviet Union's proposal to hand over former Italian African colonies to the direct trusteeship of the United Nations.

Dulles emphasized that the Soviet Union would also participate in the United Nations' trusteeship, and therefore asked whether it was fair to hand over the fate of African residents to a divided United Nations. Dulles accused the Soviet Union of being responsible for the inability to reach an agreement on Italian colonies. He stated that the 1945 London Conference reached a stalemate because the Soviet Union demanded trusteeship of Tripolitania "when Soviet troops did not participate in the liberation of Libya."

[Reuters, Lake Success, 21st] The UN Political Committee continued its discussion on the Italian colonies issue today. Soviet Representative Gromyko strongly condemned the attempts of Britain and the United States to divide the former Italian colonies and hand them over to Britain, the United States, Italy, and Abyssinia for partition. He said that the Italian colonies under British rule were deteriorating and that Britain and the United States were obstructing an agreement on the Italian colonies issue at the Foreign Ministers' Conference because Britain and the United States wanted to use these lands to achieve their selfish military strategic goals. He said that the remarks of US Representative Dulles represented the US General Staff. Britain is extracting valuable materials in the Italian colonies under its rule and neglecting the education of the residents. The attitude of British rule in the colonies can be seen in general by observing the remarks of India. Gromyko said that the Soviet Union's proposals on Italian colonies were entirely based on the interests of the local residents.

### Australia Deeply Wary of Japan; Japan Will Re-Arm After a New War Breaks Out; Will Come Up With Another Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere

[Reuters, Melbourne, 21st] Australian Immigration Minister Calwell said in a speech to the Royal Imperial Association today: When the Third World War breaks out, the United States may use Britain and Japan as "aircraft carriers". As a result, Japan will re-arm and its industry will be rebuilt. The issue for Australia will be who will again carry out the task of disarming Japan. Japan will quickly become Australia's rival, and will undoubtedly come up with another Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Plan. Calwell also said: Australia needs at least ten years and at most 25 years to prepare for another war. Australia needs a population of 25 million to develop and maintain Australia, so Australia must obtain such a population within at most 25 years.

### America's Strategy

— Translated by this Newspaper's Editorial Department

America has encountered another difficulty. It has promised too much to the nations of the world, while in reality being able to do too little. America promised to defend the entire Western Hemisphere, promised to send supplies to others, and promised to guarantee the military security of others. Now, it cannot help but discount these promises. The person responsible for "discounting" is General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in wartime Europe. His official title is Special Advisor to the U.S. Secretary of Defense, and he serves as chairman when the Joint Chiefs of Staff hold meetings.

With the Far Eastern situation changing to its current stage, the United States has apparently decided to temporarily cease sending large amounts of money and troops to Asia. General MacArthur in Japan now knows that the United States is not prepared to further strengthen its military forces in Japan. Just like the Second World War, the main battlefield of the "Cold War" is Europe. If the "Cold War" turns into a "Hot War," the main battlefield will still be in Europe.

In Europe, although the Scandinavian countries and Italy are important, they are considered secondary in the current assessment. The United States has decided to prioritize spending money in areas where it can achieve the greatest effect.

The U.S. military has decided to focus on the Atlantic and temporarily relax its grip on the Pacific. The Navy has announced the closure of eleven naval air stations in the Pacific region. China has been shelved, and Japan is no longer being reconstructed from a military standpoint. The main U.S. defense bases in the Pacific region will now be Okinawa and the Philippines.

The Marshall Plan for European recovery has been decided to continue on its previous scale, with the aim of making these countries completely self-sufficient by 1952. The United States will continue to aid West Germany, so that it can gradually achieve a status similar to that of other non-communist countries in Europe. However, even with these plans, the burden of the United States overseas is already considerable. Therefore, President Truman has requested General Eisenhower's assistance to formulate a basic national defense strategy.

The main goal of the defense of the United States and other European countries is, of course, to deter the Soviet threat. According to Eisenhower, if a war is fought against the Soviet Union, the decisive battlefield will be Europe. Currently, the Western countries have about fifteen divisions in Europe, of which only seven are capable of combat, while the Soviet Union has as many as fifty to sixty divisions in East Germany alone, and can add another hundred divisions to the fighting within a few weeks. According to the estimates of American military experts, given such a disparity in forces, the Soviet army could indeed reach Gibraltar after a relatively short offensive. Therefore, they believe that Western European countries must build strong military forces in order to talk about security.

Before building these military forces, the primary question is: What kind of army should be built? Eisenhower is here to help the government answer these questions.

Of course, military experts have different opinions. Some advocate using atomic bombs. They say that in a war against the Soviet Union, air warfare should be relied upon. The U.S. military can use long-range aircraft to fly directly from the United States to Soviet cities and industrial areas to drop atomic bombs. Air Force experts say that the new American super bombers can fly extremely high and extremely fast, making the Soviet army helpless. However, opponents say that even if the United States has a large number of these new aircraft, there is still the question of whether the bombardiers can hit their targets when dropping atomic bombs at high altitude. Moreover, when bombing Moscow and Leningrad, perhaps it is not only Soviet people who will be killed, but also French people or other Western European civilians who have been captured by the Soviet army as hostages. Moreover, if the Soviet army launches a sudden attack, perhaps the U.S. troops currently stationed in Germany will become these hostages and become victims of atomic bombs.

Some advocate using bombing to cut off the Soviet army's rear lines of communication, isolating the front-line Soviet troops. However, cutting off 1,200 miles of communication lines is a rather difficult task. Military strategists believe that it is not easy to do in practice, especially since the Soviet side also has fighter planes for defense.

General MacArthur believes that Europe and Asia should be considered equally important. He believes that Japan can be used as a base to attack eastern Siberia. However, Washington's view is that the U.S. military should concentrate on Europe and take a defensive stance in the Far East.

The Navy advocates making full use of aircraft carriers, so that planes can take off from the carriers and fly to the Soviet Union to drop atomic bombs. Aircraft carriers are flexible to use and difficult for the Soviet army to defend against. However, since the main battlefield is in Western Europe, the use of aircraft carriers can only be in a supporting role.

All of these opinions are being carefully studied, and the final plan adopted may include a little of each.

However, the main effort now is to build a ground force in Western Europe. The new army's equipment will particularly emphasize how to deal with the Soviet army's famous heavy tanks and artillery. Experts say that the new army should be equipped with automatic-firing anti-tank guns, supplemented by a strong air force. Much of this equipment can be obtained from U.S. military surplus. The U.S. General Staff has begun to sort it out, preparing to send it to Europe. According to current estimates, military equipment worth about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars will be sent to Europe in the first year. Most of these weapons will be sent to France and Belgium, because if the Soviet army launches a sudden attack, these two countries will be in the most dangerous situation.

Military strategists are considering many troublesome issues. For example, it is difficult to say to what extent the Western European armies will be willing to fight if the Soviet army invades. In addition, if the Soviet Union believes that war is inevitable and launches a preemptive strike to occupy all of Western Europe, then the military equipment that the United States sends to Western Europe will run the risk of falling entirely into the hands of the Soviet army. At that time, the United States will have to start manufacturing military equipment again.

However, American civil officials familiar with the situation in the Soviet Union believe that the possibility of this danger is extremely small. They say that although the Soviet Union is loudly opposing the North Atlantic Treaty, it will not take too extreme actions that would provoke a third world war.

### Murder Case Occurs in Yangjing Town South, Head of Civil Defense Corps Dies Tragically From Gunshot Wound

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] In the area of the Second Pond of Lujiazhai, south of Yangjing Town, Pudong, defensive fortifications are being built. Unexpectedly, sometime after 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, several laborers went to the home of a Ding, a member of the local civil defense corps, to borrow hoes, but were refused, leading to a dispute. In self-defense, the civil defense member fired a shot. At that time, the laborers reported to the soldiers supervising the construction. Several soldiers and laborers went to Ding's house to argue. At that time, the civil defense member Ding had gone to the home of the deputy captain of the detachment to report the facts. At the same time, Cao Zhenjia, the head of the civil defense squad, also received the news and rushed to Ding's house with the platoon leader of the stationed troops to mediate.

### Amethyst Ship Still Not Out of Danger, Sixteen Seriously Injured Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, Speaker Pan and Others Visited the Hospital One After Another to Express Their Condolences

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The British warship "Amethyst," which was shelled by the Communist army, sailed up the Yangtze River yesterday afternoon and reached the vicinity of the Grand Canal entrance, where it was shelled again. Seventeen officers and soldiers who died on the ship will be buried at sea. Sixteen seriously injured personnel were transferred to the shore before departure and transported to the city by the fifth train on the Shanghai-Nanjing line at 5:30 PM yesterday. They were immediately sent to the US Naval Hospital for treatment by ambulance. While they were on the train, they received blood transfusions from students at a church hospital in Zhenjiang, which was of great help. The British seaplane "Sunderland" flew from Shanghai to the "Amethyst's" stranded location at 12:20 PM yesterday, carrying doctors and medicine, and arrived in 45 minutes. It was immediately shelled by the Communist army, and the radio equipment and antenna were hit. Because the plane could not carry out rescue work under fire, it took off and returned to Shanghai.

[Central News Agency Dispatch] According to British News Service information, the British warship "Amethyst," which was damaged by the Communist army north of the Yangtze River, is currently anchored in the Yangtze River east of Xiangfan Island (transliteration) at the entrance of the Grand Canal. The ship once set sail yesterday morning, but was stopped by the Communist army's artillery fire.

Also, the bodies of the officers and soldiers who died on the "Consort" will be buried with the bodies of the officers and soldiers who died on the "London" at the Hongqiao Cemetery at 10:30 AM today. At that time, the British Navy will fire three salutes. A memorial service for the officers and soldiers who died on the three ships will be held at Trinity Church at 10:30 AM tomorrow morning.

London Ship Hit and Turned Back, Reportedly Twenty-Three Injured

[United Press Dispatch] The British 10,000-ton cruiser "London" sailed to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River yesterday to rescue the stranded British warship "Amethyst" and was heavily shelled by the Communist army, turning back to Shanghai. A United Press reporter visited the ship today and saw two shell hits on the ship's hull, one on the starboard side and one on the second front turret. There were small shell marks on the chimney. The entire crew was extremely calm, but seemed very tired. Commander Cassalle refused to announce the number of casualties and the names of the dead and wounded, but according to the US Navy authorities who helped rescue the wounded, 23 wounded soldiers were sent to the hospital (British sources say 20 were injured). According to an officer on the ship, the "London" was fortunate to turn back yesterday. If it had continued to move forward, it would have been suicide. The Communist army seemed to have artillery batteries every two or three feet along the coast. Also, the "Black Swan" also turned back with the "London" yesterday and docked next to the "London." There were shell marks on the port side, and one of the oil depots had been penetrated, but fortunately it did not catch fire.

### The Process of Exposing Rice Shop Fraud is Very Interesting, A Thirteen-Year-Old Girl Has Wisdom, Unforgettable at First Sight, Finds Material Evidence, Manager Zhang is Finally Interrogated and Prosecuted

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Zhang Binggui, a native of Chongming, is the manager of Tianfu Rice Shop at No. 60 Chongqing Middle Road in the city. He was accused of corruption and fraud in handling household rice by Zhang Zipin and Zhang Xueyun, citizens of the district. The case was investigated and prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office and the first trial was held in the District Court by Judge Guo Zugan. The hearing was adjourned, as it was deemed necessary to review the account books. Many citizens of the district came to listen, as they had repeatedly been refused when purchasing household rice from the shop, on the grounds that the rice had been sold out or was out of date, resulting in considerable losses. According to the investigation, the process of exposing the case was very interesting. The details are as follows, as investigated by the reporter: On the morning of October 2nd last year, at around 7:00 AM, Tianfu Rice Shop mixed the remaining three stones and seven dou of household rice from September of the same year into five stones of self-purchased indica rice and sold it to Lüzhonghe Rice Shop on Xinwen Road. When the rice was being loaded and transported through the back door, it was discovered by local residents, who stopped it. The incident alarmed the police who came to interfere. The shop argued with the police officers while taking advantage of the gaps to transport the rice away in an attempt to destroy the evidence. At that time, someone called the Lujiawan Sub-bureau. Upon hearing the news, the police bureau ordered someone to investigate. By this time, the residents had dispersed, and only a thirteen-year-old girl, Zhang Xueyun, volunteered to testify about what she had personally witnessed. The police officers invited Zhang and her father to the bureau to testify. Unexpectedly, the little girl suddenly left without saying goodbye. The police officers did not pay attention to it at first, thinking that she was timid and afraid to go to the bureau. However, not long after, the police bureau suddenly received a call from her, saying that she had seized the rice transported by Tianfu Rice Shop and asked them to go to the bureau to transport it as evidence. Because she was young and intelligent, she had seen Lüzhonghe Rice Shop when passing Xinzhala Road on her way to school on weekdays, and the impression remained in her mind. That morning, when she saw that the rice sacks transported by Tianfu had the Lüzhonghe brand, she suddenly remembered the previous matter and knew that if there was no material evidence when reporting to the police, the crime could not be established. Therefore, she hired a tricycle to rush to Xinzhala Road. Because it was still early, Lüzhonghe had not yet opened, and the collapse of the Tianfu Rice Shop transport vehicle was slow, so it had not yet arrived. Therefore, as soon as it arrived, she identified it. After the police transported it to the bureau as evidence, the patrol officer from the sub-bureau obtained a cup of rice for matching, which was similar to the rice sold to Lüzhonghe. At this point, Zhang confessed to selling household rice privately. However, after Zhang was released on bail and returned to the shop, he transported four stones of mixed rice to Zhenxingguan Hotel using the same method the next day. Zhang heard this and was even more indignant, so he reported to the District Prosecutor's Office. The District Prosecutor's Office sent a judicial police officer to investigate and handle the matter. Zhang, unable to hide anything, also confessed that five dou of the four stones were household rice. However, he submitted a statement arguing that the household rice was swapped with other rice and that the sale was not illegal. The District Prosecutor's Office inquired with the People's Mediation Committee and received a reply stating that the household rice allocated to each grain distribution store by the office must be issued with a certificate, and there is no way to allow separate sales. Based on this, the District Prosecutor's Office believed that the evidence of Zhang's crime was extremely clear and could not be denied, so he was prosecuted.

### Public Utility Pricing, Municipal Government Revises Measures, Water, Electricity, Gas, and Telephone Charges Will Be Adjusted Daily According to Prices, Public Transportation Fares Will Be Adjusted Every Five Days, The Council's Public Utilities Group Will Hold Another Meeting Today to Decide

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] In order to protect the public utility companies in the city, the Municipal Government has revised the public utility pricing measures. (1) For the four items of water, electricity, gas, and telephone, the original base number is still used, and the daily price index published by the Central Bank is used for adjustment. Users will uniformly calculate and pay according to the index on the payment date. If they are willing to prepay, the company should accept it and will not be affected by price adjustments during the prepayment period, but it is limited to one month's usage. (2) For public transportation businesses, part of the measures will refer to the above methods, and adjustments will be made every five days on a trial basis. However, transportation businesses are fundamentally different from water, electricity, gas, and telephone in that the higher the price, the fewer the passengers, and the income still cannot cover the expenses. Therefore, the only remedy is to request the Central Bank to increase the loan for public transportation businesses on the original amount to meet the companies' needs for one month's power costs (including oil, coal, electricity, etc.) and salary expenses, and it must be repaid by each company in full on the last day of each month. Furthermore, at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, an emergency meeting was held in the Municipal Government Conference Room, co-chaired by Secretary-General Chen Liang, attended by City Council Speaker Pan, Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhang Rentao, Councilors Jiang Hao, Jiang Haoran, Chen Peide, Qu Cheng, Ye Fenghu, and the heads of various public utility companies in the city, Simpson, Pollock, and others, totaling more than 30 people.

Currency Depreciation Accelerates, Company Losses Increase

First, Secretary-General Chen elaborated on the significance of the meeting, stating that public utility prices are adjusted twice a month, while prices rise several times a day, and the company's business will inevitably be unsustainable. We must seek proper rescue methods, otherwise, once water and electricity are cut off, social order will be disrupted, and production will be halted, so we must plan a solution in advance. Then, Director Zhang reported on the Municipal Government's proposed revision of pricing measures and the economic difficulties of various companies, stating that the public utility pricing and charging measures in the city are adjusted according to the multiple of the cost of living index determined by the City Council. However, due to the accelerating depreciation of the currency and the monthly jumps in prices and exchange rates, the March revenue of each company accounted for only about 33% to 56% of the expenditure, which shows that the revenue and expenditure losses of each company have reached an extremely serious level. The British Tramway Company Pollock once sent a letter to the Public Utilities Bureau stating that the company's losses were too great and could only be maintained until May 15. 100 million yuan, but the daily average income is only 100 million yuan, and on the 5th, it can only earn 1.4 billion yuan. In addition to requesting the Central Bank to relax the loan scale to maintain it, there is no other way to follow.

Under the Serious Burden, It is Really Difficult to Cope

Then, Speaker Pan delivered a speech stating that in the new fiscal and financial reform plan promulgated by the government, tax revenue is adjusted according to customs yuan and price index, and workers have also requested to be paid in silver dollars. It is really difficult for the company to cope under these two burdens. The citizens' enjoyment of public utilities should have a reasonable burden to maintain the business of each company, otherwise, once water and electricity are cut off, it is equivalent to helping the Communists destroy Shanghai, so revising the pricing measures is indeed urgent.

Finally, Councilors Jiang Hao, Qu Cheng, Ye Fenghu, and others successively expressed their opinions, unanimously agreeing that maintaining public utilities is important, but the lives of citizens must also be taken into account, because citizens' income is in gold yuan coupons, and their expenses have been calibrated in silver dollars. If public utility prices are adjusted monthly, citizens will really not be able to bear it, so they believe that the government should support public utilities with its greatest strength and relax the loan scale, and restore the subsidy policy. The meeting decided to hold a meeting of the City Council's Public Utilities Subcommittee at 3:00 PM today to make a decision and submit it to the City Council for approval and implementation, and to invite senior officials from the Central Bank and various public utility companies to attend for explanation.

### A Tragic Change in a Family on Fanyu Road, West Shanghai, A Biological Mother Forces Her Own Daughter to Take Poison Out of Jealousy

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] At about 9:00 AM yesterday morning, a tragic case of a biological mother forcing her own daughter out of jealousy occurred at No. 15, Lane 209, Fanyu Road, West Shanghai. The details are as follows:

Fei Aisi, a 37-year-old woman from Beiping, graduated from the National Central Senior Nurse Vocational School. She worked as a nurse in a hospital in Beiping and married Wang Jingxi, with whom she had a daughter named Qingyun, who is now twenty years old. At first, Fei entrusted her daughter to her mother to raise, while she lived with Wang. Later, the two divorced due to emotional disagreements. Fei then came to Shanghai and remarried Shen Renjie, a native of Zhejiang and the director of medical affairs at the Central Printing Paper Factory in the city, through introductions, and they had two sons and one daughter. In June last year, Fei brought her daughter Qingyun back from Beiping to live with her. Shen saw that the girl was graceful and often approached her, which aroused Fei's suspicion, and she often beat and humiliated her daughter. Recently, Fei had a younger sister named Clara, who came to Shanghai from Taiwan with her maid Jiang Jianzhen and stayed at her home. She often saw her sister beating and humiliating her daughter and advised her to leave temporarily. It was originally scheduled to be sent to her younger sister in Qingdao by Fei's sister on the same day. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, before Fei's sister went out to buy boat tickets, she was afraid that an accident would happen and asked the maid Jiang Xian to pay attention at all times. Unexpectedly, after 9:30, Fei Aisi became vicious and summoned her daughter, tightly closing the door. She took out a cup of black liquid medicine and told her daughter to drink it, and then took out a cup of white liquid medicine and told her daughter to drink it again. The daughter begged for mercy, but Fei's mother refused. While struggling, the maid Jiang Xianzhen heard it, peeked through the crack in the window, and learned the truth. She urgently reported to the Facao Police Station, and Section Chief Shi Jieren ordered Section Members Zhu Yunzhang, Cadre Li Zonglan, Chen Xianzhong, and others to rush to the scene. Fei's daughter was already in a coma. They quickly flew her to the First Hospital of the Red Cross for treatment and detained her mother. After learning the facts, the bureau is continuing its investigation.

### Bribery Case of Patrol Sergeant and Police Officer, Only One Person Appeared in Court for Retrial

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Hongkou Sub-bureau Patrol Sergeant Yan Xuehui, while on duty on November 1 last year, accepted a bribe because someone was transporting dirty goods and distributed the bribe to police officers Lou Rui, You Fengchi, Ling Yunxiao, Wei Ping, etc. by 10 yuan, 20 yuan, etc. The next day, Lou and You reported the information to the sub-bureau chief and sent the 30 gold yuan given by Yan for review and handling. As a result, Yan Ling and Wei were investigated. In the District Court's judgment on December 6, Yan was sentenced to five years in prison, and the cases of Ling and Wei were not accepted. Yan refused to accept the judgment and applied for retrial. After Yan and Ling were released on bail, they fled. The High Court then sent the case back to the District Court for retrial. It is said that Yan and Ming both refused to appear in court. Wei responded to questioning several times. Judge Ye Guiling retried the case in the District Court yesterday, and it is said that Wei's case will be sentenced to more than seven years in prison according to law. After the defense lawyer repeatedly requested, Judge Ye approved the postponement of the sentencing to the 26th to find more powerful rebuttal evidence, hoping to reduce Wei's culpability.

### Two Cases of Gambling Bust in Pudong

### News from Anqing

— Our reporter, Liu Zao

Preparedness for War and Seeking Peace: Wu Zhongjian

Pengze is a small county town of mountains and waters. During the Jin Dynasty,

Mr. Five Willows

once served as the county magistrate. Therefore, there are still Five Willows Township, Five Willows Hall, and various historical sites commemorating Tao Yuanming. If not for this Anqing battle, outsiders would probably have few opportunities to enter this city. Although it is located on the riverside, the ships traveling between Shanghai and Hankou do not stop here, and even cars do not use it as a main line stop. However, those who travel through Pengze are attracted by the solitary Xiaogu Mountain in the heart of the river, considering it a scenic spot. Thus, the once-famous hometown of Mr. Five Willows, Pengze, is forgotten.

Recently, due to the war, most of the original residents have moved away. The remaining common people number less than 3,000 in the entire city. The only restaurant is quite busy catering to the soldiers passing through. However, for newcomers, finding a hotel or renting a small shop here is like climbing to the sky because there are no hotels or inns in the whole city to accommodate guests. The only option for the commanders here is to mingle with the common people. I, as a reporter, had to painstakingly negotiate with Lao Yan, the restaurant owner, for accommodation during my trip to Pengze. Only then did I manage to secure a space, renting a dilapidated bed with lice-infested cotton wadding for one night, costing five jiao in silver dollars or one hundred and fifty copper coins (commonly known as copper notes). — One silver dollar can be exchanged for three hundred copper coins; gold yuan coupons are redundant currency here.

Xiaogu Mountain, also known as Xiaogu Hill, is located approximately eight li downstream from Pengze in the heart of the river, within the territory of Wangjiang, Anhui Province. I, as a reporter, returned from Anqing this time.

While passing through Pengze, due to the insistence of the garrison division commander Zhang Xunting and Chief of Staff Dong Ziliang to stay for a day, I ascended Xiaogu Mountain with Chief of Staff Dong on the 15th to fulfill a long-held wish. Just as we were using binoculars to view the distant scenery north of the river, we suddenly discovered Communist troops' guard units in Liu Family Row, Shanghuayuan, and other places three li from the mountain's base. Immediately, a platoon leader of the mountain garrison, carrying a "60" mortar, placed it next to the "Xiaogu" dressing pavilion and fired one shot, two shots... across the river. There was no response. After waiting a while, the plainclothes scouts reported that there were indeed over five hundred Communist troops hiding in the villages in Liu Family Row and other places, attempting to move westward.

Pengze is designated by the Ministry of National Defense as a model county for civilian training. Currently, the civilian training work in Pengze is not proceeding according to plan due to its proximity to the front line, the military's need for supplies, and the people's difficult and uneasy lives. Moreover, the current Pengze has a complex system of military and political jurisdiction. Politically, it originally belonged to the 16th Pacification Zone; militarily, it now belongs to the 4th Army Corps; transportation belongs to the 8th Pacification Zone. The county magistrate's superiors include these three military organs, as well as his direct superiors—the provincial government, the commissioner's office, and the provincial security headquarters.

Another serious problem, which may not be entirely unique to Pengze, is

the supplementary funding for the garrison's non-staple food expenses. For a Pengze that is impoverished to the point of destitution, supplying a division's non-staple food deficit and borrowing staple food is truly unaffordable. Moreover, in addition to this, there are many unavoidable public and private supplies.

D渡口 (D渡口) is the "stepping stone" to Anqing. In normal times, it is just a small river crossing town, but now it has become a bustling little street with hotels, restaurants, and Western-style tailors, etc. Some come from the rear, others return from the front. Car drivers are the most proud here; coming from Pengze, it is indispensable; going to the rear, it is indispensable. A "yellow croaker" fish costs four silver dollars in Pengze, at least two.

The prices here are twice as high as in Pengze. A small room costs one silver dollar per night, and a meal with one dish and one soup costs five jiao. If one cannot reach Anqing smoothly before 5 PM, even finding a place to stay for the night becomes a big problem.

Nine days ago, people at D渡口 were

bombed once by Communist aircraft. I, as a reporter, specially interviewed several friends working here. They admitted that a bomb really fell at D渡口 that day, injuring twelve people, but causing no deaths. As for the markings of the aircraft, they could not be identified because they were flying at high altitude. According to the front-line report on that day, there were six aircraft in formation flying over Qipanshan in the eastern suburbs of Anqing, cooperating with the defending troops in the front line. It happened that Deputy Regiment Commander of 口口 Division and three reporters from Anqing's Xinmin and other newspapers were inspecting the positions on Qipanshan when they were hit by an aircraft bomb and injured. The three companions were also slightly injured. After a while, news of a bombing at D渡口 also came. After inquiries to Nanjing, it was learned that the bombing was due to a malfunction in the bomb rack of one of the aircraft, causing the bomb to be dropped. Therefore, the mystery of the widespread rumor of Communist aircraft bombing D渡口 was solved! According to the defending division commander Wu Zhongjian, no Communist aircraft have been found cooperating in combat on the Anqing front.

Anqing under seven general offensives by the Communist army, the National Army's position, as stable as Mount Tai, is a miracle. This is the achievement of the military loving the people and the people supporting the military. The so-called "miracle" is that the defending troops defeated a Communist army with more than five times their strength with

inferior forces, defeating the Communist army's 11th Army and an independent division, as well as a cadre regiment and an independent brigade, and achieving a casualty ratio of 20 to 1. The National Army had the advantage. The achievement of this "miracle" is, of course, due to military-civilian coordination and combined operations of the army, navy, and air force.

The street stalls in Anqing city reflect the people's war life. They still quietly live their lives under the noise of artillery fire.

Qian Zhendong, the magistrate of Huaining (i.e., Anqing) County, was originally the speaker of the county council. On the eve of taking office, he did not know there was such a thing. On the evening of March 23, the provincial government withdrew, and the former county magistrate, Zeng, could not withstand the threat of war. He ran to D渡口 with his people and seals. It was a chaotic and tense situation, and Deputy County Magistrate Hu Mengsong handed over the seals on his behalf. Therefore, County Magistrate Qian dared to shoulder this responsibility. It can be considered

accepting a mission in a time of crisis. He said: Can the people of Anqing say no today?

National "Anhui University," because the campus is located in the eastern suburbs of the city near the battlefield, has been suspended. Most of the more than 800 faculty and students have left Anqing. There are still more than 200 people stranded in the city. For them, studying is certainly impossible, and even two meals a day may soon become a problem, because President Yang Lianggong has long gone to Beijing. In this sudden change, what can be done to rescue this group of faculty and students who are deeply trapped in the artillery fire from distant Nanjing? Therefore, the faculty and staff formed a school affairs maintenance committee, and the students formed an emergency response committee. For the sake of livelihood, they also set up street stalls, placing their only few tattered books and torn clothes on the open space in front of the Commissioner's Park, letting people choose. This is the misfortune of the education sector and a satire on the local government.

Some of the secondary and higher schools in the city have relocated, while others are still holding classes. Some primary schools are also holding classes, which is commendable.

What is admirable is the several newspaper offices in the city. Although under the artillery fire of more than 20 days of bitter fighting, there are still three newspapers, Evening News, Xinmin News, and Xinmin Duo News, continuing to publish. Because the streets are under curfew after 8 PM every night, and passage is not allowed, they have changed to publishing noon newspapers. Except for the telecommunications department, which still copies broadcasts on time, the personnel of the compilation and editing departments start work every morning, constantly providing the troops and civilians on the Anqing front line with accurate reports on the front-line battles, the peace talks that everyone cares about, and national events. Their publication has had considerable success in encouraging morale and stabilizing public sentiment. Unfortunately, the distribution range of each newspaper is limited to the small circle of the city and D渡口. The total distribution of the three newspapers is only about 1,000 copies. In the past, Jiujiang's Xingbao Newspaper had a large market in Anqing, Wangjiang, Susong, Taihu, etc. Now, it is also cut off due to the war. When I, as a reporter, went to Anqing this time, Hu Shijue, the publisher of Xingbao Newspaper, specially entrusted me to bring 100 copies of the newspaper to distribute to the defending troops and the people of Anhui in the city to express his condolences.

According to the county government's investigation, there are currently 70,000 people in Anqing City, a decrease of about 20,000 to 30,000 compared to before the start of this defensive battle. However, with the addition of a division and attached troops, as well as refugees stranded from other counties, the total population of the city may not have decreased too much compared to before March 23. However, the current problem is the supply of grain and oil necessary for the daily life of these tens of thousands of people. The power plant's power supply every night has not only not decreased but has increased because a portion of the defense positions in the suburbs of the city can be illuminated by electricity. In addition to supplying domestic users, the newly installed street lights around the city are lit all night. However, the fuel supply for the power plant has become a problem. Recently, the defending troops negotiated with the China Merchants Bureau for a batch of stored oil to meet the needs.

Although I, as a reporter, encountered many difficulties during the week-long journey to and from Anqing, seeing the heroic fighting of the defending troops in Anqing and the stability of the lives of the people in the city gave me a deep and firm belief.

### Miscellaneous Notes from Fenghua

— Our reporter correspondent Li Hongsheng

[Our newspaper Fenghua 21st dispatch] This county, formerly an administrative region, is one of the six counties belonging to Ningbo Prefecture. The residents' language is the Ningbo dialect with slight variations in pronunciation. The language of the residents in the neighboring towns of Ninghai County is similar to the Taiwan dialect. However, the people are honest and upright, and their lives are frugal and simple. Those living near the mountains gather firewood, while those living near the sea engage in fishing and salt production. There are few great merchants who are adept at maneuvering. Wedding and funeral etiquette still follow ancient traditions. Belief in ghosts and gods, and faith in Buddhism and Taoism are still prevalent among the people. The general populace is honest and hardworking, and they are enthusiastic about local public welfare undertakings. Eating three meals a day is common. However, farmers in the southwest of the county eat mostly coarse grains such as sorghum and wheat. They live mainly in tiled houses, usually one household per room. Commoners rise at dawn and rest at dusk. Most do not have bad habits. Gambling is no less prevalent than in other counties, and the authorities are currently strictly cracking down on it.

Weddings and Funerals

In recent years, due to the aftermath of the war, large family forms have gradually decreased, and women in small families must shoulder the burden of household management. Because women's education is not very developed, their service to society is also rare. Social customs are mostly carried out through weddings, birthdays, and funerals. Usually, only seasonal gifts are exchanged. The people mostly believe in Buddhism, followed by Christianity. Superstitious activities such as welcoming gods and holding temple fairs are now extremely rare. However, Buddhist and Taoist water and land rituals, chanting sutras for seven days and nights, and worshiping the Liang Emperor, although not completely extinct, are gradually declining in rural areas. Public entertainment venues include the County-run Zhongzheng Library, the People's Education Hall, Zhongshan Park, Zhongzheng Park, and the public sports field. People's marriages are based on the family's wealth to achieve a match in social status. The wealthy marry earlier, and the poor marry later. Usually, men marry at the age of twenty, and women marry at the age of eighteen. The bad habits of child brides and selling wives have gradually decreased. However, due to the economic downturn and livelihood concerns, there is a gradual trend of late marriage. Wedding ceremonies for families of middle and upper classes are quite extravagant, with dowries being the most important. There are old rituals such as "betrothal" and "exchanging letters" through matchmakers. Towns and cities follow new styles. Nowadays, due to high prices, simplified wedding ceremonies are becoming more common. Funeral ceremonies are also quite elaborate, with procedures such as "issuing announcements," "encoffining," "public mourning," and "funeral procession." The wealthy are also very particular about coffins, and they often choose a site to build a tomb, burying the deceased after many years. The poor have difficulty even affording a thin coffin, and temporary burials are not uncommon.

Education

This county has been ordered to implement national education since the 29th year. According to the number approved by the Provincial Department of Education, the original eighteen district-run primary schools were changed to township central schools, and one hundred and one primary schools with better performance in each bao were changed to bao national schools. Although it was not perfect at the beginning of the implementation, it has been gradually improved, and the scale has been established. When the county seat fell, most of them were destroyed. Since the 31st year, when the local order was slightly stabilized, the authorities have tried their best to rectify it. First, the schools that were closed were reopened, and the number of students was increased as much as possible. The townships (towns) and baos where schools were not established were established as much as possible. On the one hand, the establishment of educational central institutions in the occupied areas was promoted, and comrades in the education sector were responsible for contacting, eliminating the enslaving education. The school affairs and facilities of each school were strengthened under the guidance of various standards and regulations issued by the Ministry and Province, the treatment of teachers was improved, the funds of the township (town) and Bao National Schools were enriched, and the implementation of civil education work in the National Schools at all levels was supervised. Since the county was liberated after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, after the active reorganization by the authorities, there are now 285 elementary education schools, including Central National Schools and Bao National Schools. There are four secondary education schools: Wuling School, County Middle School, County Simple Normal School, and Private Zhongyi Junior High School. There are public education schools such as the County Zhongzheng Library, the People's Education Hall, and the Public Sports Field.

Economy

This county is an agricultural county, and most people are engaged in agriculture. All crops, in addition to rice, wheat, and vegetables, are bamboo, wood, firewood, and charcoal produced in the three townships of Ganrun, Wanzhu, and Zhenting in the south of the county, and water honey peaches produced in the Jinhua township, which are transported and sold to Shanghai, Ningbo and other places, and enjoy a high reputation. Among the marine products, the number of yellow croakers, sharks, and mantis shrimps in Wutongshan Township, Tongzhao, and Qifeng, which are located near the Xiangshan Port, is also quite considerable. Every year, most fishermen go to sea to fish from the 25th and 6th of the third lunar month to the end of June, and the fishing income is very large, and the people rely on it to maintain their livelihoods. Nowadays, due to soaring prices, income cannot make ends meet, and the economy is quite exhausted.

### A Horse That Broke Loose Trampled Multiple People to Death

[Our newspaper Jiaxing 20th dispatch] At about 8 PM on the 20th, a horse that broke loose from Dongdaying ran away, rushed from the Dongmen urban area, and trampled two children to death in Dongmen. At the intersection of Zhongshan Road and Jianguo Road, the horse's foot got caught in the wheel of a rickshaw and overturned it. The rickshaw puller was crushed and injured under the horse's belly. The crowd of "Xiao Rehun" selling pear paste candy who were watching pushed the horse and rescued the rickshaw puller. Xu Guisheng was also knocked down, with a hole kicked in the back of his head and injuries to his chest and back. He was seriously injured. Then, he rushed straight to Zhongshan Road and trampled a man over 40 years old to death. The horse was also killed near the Huode Temple.

### Daylight Robbery in the Southern District

The Guards at Guanqiao Watch Without Saving

Editor: Please disclose this letter. I am a partner in a store in Fengxian Town, Pudong. On April 16, I transported eight small packages of cotton yarn from Shanghai back to Feng on behalf of the store. When I was loading the boat at the Guanqiao Wharf in the Southern District, a group of hooligans (about seven or eight people) cut open the grass bags with foreign knives and robbed the yarn. I and the rickshaw puller were both knocked to the ground. After the event, it was found that four packages were robbed. At that time, the Fourth Guardhouse of the Penglai Branch was set up there, but several policemen turned a blind eye and condoned the hooligans and robbery. Afterwards, I asked them to track them down, but they replied: "Cannot investigate!" Then I went to the Penglai Branch to report, but the gatekeeper refused to accept it! He only said that you should report to the policemen in the guardhouse and ask him to investigate! Sir, you think that under the clear sky, things were robbed, and the police didn't care. Now, I hope that your newspaper will publish it so that others can be careful to prevent the same thing from happening. I am extremely grateful. Shen Xingguo, Qi Xian Town, Zhongyi Township, Erbao, Shiwujia, Liuhu, Fengxian, who was robbed, pays his respects

### New Discussion on Education in Yixing

— Special Correspondent Zhu Xianggao of This Newspaper

[This Newspaper Yixing 20th Dispatch] Every outsider who has left footprints in Yixing generally agrees that the culture and standards in Yixing are more developed compared to other provinces and counties. The driving force behind the improvement of culture and knowledge is the popularization of education. Director Hong of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department once told reporters with pride, "Jiangsu is number one in education nationwide, and Yixing is number one in education in Jiangsu." This was indeed the conclusion he reached based on educational theory and his inspection of educational undertakings in various counties. His approach to education was to start with eliminating illiteracy and popularizing education, and he also planned to create a demonstration area for basic education to promote cultural progress, which was indeed insightful. Recently, County Magistrate Zhou Jingyu, after his first inspection of the rural areas and towns since taking office, told reporters the first thing he said was that Yixing's education is more successful than any other undertaking, which is truly well-deserved. To understand the truth, the reporter inquired with the local education authorities about the general situation of education in the county and deeply felt that the core of education in the county is still trapped in a difficult and arduous abyss. However, it is only through the understanding of the overall situation and the perseverance and efforts of the education personnel that achievements have been made. Therefore, this article is written to serve as a reference for education professionals in various regions.

To be honest, the achievements of education in Yixing are still far behind those of major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. However, compared to general provinces and counties, it is indeed superior. According to the area of 2.6 million mu in Yixing, the total number of students is 55,679. On average, every mu of land has slightly less than 47 students, accounting for slightly more than 8.8% of the total population. If we exclude women, children, the elderly, and professionals, then about 80% of the population are students receiving education. The primary school sector has 48,206 students, with an average age of about six to fifteen years old. The secondary school sector has 7,473 students, with an average age of about thirteen to seventeen years old. There are a total of 540 schools. Each large town has two to three secondary schools, with a total of seventeen in the county. There are 523 primary schools, with a community school in every small village of a dozen or so households. The larger towns can have up to six central elementary schools. Although the equipment is not entirely satisfactory, the quality and quantity are generally well-developed. Even if it is included among the civilized countries of the world, it is still a county with very popular education.

The quality of national education teachers in this county has always been quite high. However, during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the management was lacking, resulting in great chaos. Since the restoration, the County Education Bureau has made the rectification of teachers a central task. In 1947, it entrusted the county-run middle school to concurrently run a one-year simplified normal class to train existing teachers, strictly screen whether teachers were qualified, and strengthen training for those who were nearly qualified. All teachers were examined and passed by the Education Bureau and assigned in a unified manner. This work was completed within one year, and more than half of the teachers were eliminated. Immediately felt that there was an abnormal shortage of teachers. In the autumn of last year, the county-run simplified normal school was established independently to specialize in the training of teachers. Currently, in addition to Principal Tang Weizhou, there are nine teachers, divided into one one-year class and two four-year classes, with 161 students. The principals of the school have rich educational experience, and the management is quite effective. Each term of graduates is assigned by the Education Bureau in a unified manner. According to Director Jiang Wenjie's estimation, the teacher force in this county can be adjusted and completed in two years, gradually reaching above the standard level.

There are currently 450 middle school teachers and 1,641 primary school teachers, with women accounting for about 40% of the lower-level middle school teachers. The average salary is from seven shi to eight dou of white rice. Only a small number of technical and specialized teachers in senior high schools have high salaries. Three-fifths of the teachers are still trapped in a state of living in absolute poverty. The only reason is that the county's finances are exhausted, and the education expenses only cover the quota for 500 people, which is far from the actual needs. However, the local people attach great importance to the etiquette and culture left by their ancestors. In every village with slightly more residents, wealthy households donate to promote education. The more they donate, the more free preferential treatment their children receive. Therefore, although nominally managed by the Education Bureau, most of the school properties are supported by local donations. The nominal township schools have disappeared, creating the current thriving scene. Despite the fact that it is not an overly ideal occupation, it is valued by the local people. For example, the first phase of the simplified normal school only enrolled 90 students, but more than 1,200 people applied for the exam. They know that they will struggle on the edge of life, but they understand the overall situation, recognize the times, and in any difficult situation, they still grit their teeth and never neglect or be discouraged by their duties due to the fact that their qualities do not meet their ideals. They are never willing to petition or strike. In addition, the academic atmosphere is pure and simple. Even children from poor farming families know how to concentrate on their studies and respect their teachers. Although "student movements" in outside cities are making a lot of noise, they have not infected this county at all. After the restoration, social education was turbulent, but the academic circles in this county have been in a state of peaceful singing. This is a rare phenomenon in other counties.

Here we will talk about the promotion of basic education demonstration areas repeatedly announced by the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department. According to precise statistics, the illiteracy rate in this county still accounts for slightly less than 52% of the total population. Therefore, the establishment of this program is even more necessary to actively promote. After the County Education Bureau drafted the work outline and implementation measures and submitted them for approval, they were implemented on the first of this month. However, because it requires huge expenses and a lot of manpower, it can only be carried out in the two towns of Yixing and Heqiao to pilot the demonstration area. After completion within a certain period, efforts will be gradually made to expand, and then a second suitable area will be selected for the original personnel to continue to implement.

The success of local undertakings, education first. The students of today are the administrators of the country and society in the future. Can we still underestimate education!

### Central Bank Zhenjiang Branch Moves to Suzhou

### Emergency Transportation and Sales Plan for Guizhou Salt

— Special Correspondent Liu Mengchi of This Newspaper

[This Newspaper Guiyang April 16th Airmail] Salt in Guizhou, in terms of people's daily necessities, nothing is more precious than it. Chairman Gu Zheng Lun, since November last year, has been worrying about it day and night, and doing everything possible to seek a thorough solution. Niu Jianxia, ​​Director of the Sichuan-Kang Salt Affairs Administration, was recently specially invited from Zigong to Guizhou. Taking advantage of the opportunity of the first session of the seventh meeting of the Provincial Council, the provincial government, the Salt Bureau, and public opinion organs jointly discussed it, in order to be able to obtain a practical and effective solution.

When Director Niu first arrived in Guiyang, he attempted to use the ten articles of his "Plan for Improving the Transportation and Sales of Salt in Guizhou Province" as a blueprint for discussion. In that plan, he pushed the responsibilities of the salt affairs organs at all levels cleanly, and also left many loopholes that could allow distributors and Salt Bureau personnel to collude and engage in corruption and personal gain. At the first salt affairs symposium held by the Provincial Council, Director Niu became the target of venting anger for the 11 million people of Guizhou who could not eat salt. The situation that day was truly embarrassing for him.

Subsequently, four or five symposiums were held in a row, and finally, after synthesizing opinions from all parties, the Salt Affairs Committee of the Provincial Council drafted another "Summary of Temporary Emergency Transportation and Sales Plan for Guizhou Salt" in thirteen articles, and was unanimously approved by all councilors at the conference, and sent to the provincial government for implementation. In the future, if the Salt Bureau can earnestly promote it, and the provincial government and public opinion organs can effectively supervise, then the 11 million people of Guizhou will not have to worry about expensive or bland salt.

The content of the plan is strictly stipulated: (1) The amount of salt required for Guizhou Province is 143,000 market dans. This is determined based on the province's population of one market catty of salt per person per month plus the amount of Changping salt. It is estimated that Sichuan salt is 110,000 market dans, Guangdong salt is 30,000 market dans, and Yunnan salt is 3,000 market dans, breaking the old sales system that does not conform to the actual situation, so that people in the southeast, northwest, and north of Guizhou Province can obtain the convenience of salt transportation and sales nearby. (2) The section from the Sichuan salt field to the riverbank is fully responsible for the transportation and relief by the Sichuan-Kang Salt Bureau. Guangdong and Yunnan salt will still be handled according to the usual practice, allowing individual merchants to freely purchase and transport back to Guizhou for sales, avoiding the disadvantages of the counties in southwestern and southeastern Guizhou having to eat expensive Sichuan salt. (3) Any merchant can apply to purchase and transport Sichuan salt to Guizhou for sales when it reaches the riverbank. The tax rate will still be calculated at 10% from the levy, so as to eliminate the problem of collusion and monopoly of the Salt Bureau by a small number of distributors in the past to create a black market. (4) In order to make the bank price reasonable and let the people of Guizhou understand the actual situation, the Guizhou Provincial Government and the Guizhou Provincial Council should jointly send personnel to the bank to verify the price. (5) In order to avoid the lack of salt sales in each bank due to difficult transportation routes and to encourage merchants to purchase and transport salt, the Sichuan-Kang Salt Bureau will try its best to negotiate with the national bank to provide low-interest loans to support them, because the rivers in the Wujiang River basin in northeastern Guizhou are high and the water is rapid, and transportation is difficult. I am afraid that transporters will not be happy to take risks, and people in that area may eat expensive and bland salt, so transportation and sales are especially encouraged. (6) Old transporters in 1948 who have already arrived at the bank with salt. And the salt from the field to the bank is still the responsibility of the salt merchants to transport it to the various strongholds, pay taxes and sell it freely, so as to avoid disconnection. If the transporter is unable to transport it inland, it shall be sold to scattered merchants in Guizhou Province at the bank or en route by the Sichuan-Kang Salt Bureau at the checked price. Transporters should hand over the difference between the bank sale price and the checked price to the public. If salt needs to be sold en route to support transportation, it must be reported and approved for self-sale en route. (7) After the implementation of this method, the salt that the transporters have already transported to the inner bank strongholds will be allowed to be sold freely by each merchant after paying the tax. (8) After the implementation of this method, the original method of purchasing salt with certificates and limited sales will be abolished at the same time. (9) From now on, the Guizhou Provincial Salt Affairs Agency should focus on transporting salt at the bank and strengthening the storage of Changping salt. (10) Salt merchants in each county of Guizhou Province should purchase salt in the county to avoid salt shortages. (11) The Changping salt at each stronghold, except for the salt for civil servants, teachers, schools, groups, and troops in the location of the salt affairs agency, will be issued and sold according to one catty of salt per person per month, and staff rosters will be opened. It will not be issued or sold at ordinary times. If there is a shortage of salt, it will be issued, but it will still be limited to commissioned retail sales, and its price will be determined based on weight cost. (12) This plan should be abolished no later than the end of June 1949, but if the handling is indeed effective, it may be extended after negotiation and agreement between the salt affairs agency and the Guizhou Provincial Government. (13) The salt quota that should be allocated from January to March 1949 should be transported to the designated location in a short period of time as soon as possible.

### Food and Social Affairs Bureau's Price Limit Is Not Enough To Cover The Cost. The Rice Market Is At A Standstill. Off-Site Prices Are Rising Madly. White Rice Is Selling For Three Million.

Yesterday, the Food and Social Affairs Bureau limited the price to no more than two million, but because the prices of various items outside the circle have risen far more than the price of rice, and the production price remains firm, the price limit is not enough to cover the cost, so trading cannot be opened.

Off-site prices rose sharply by 40% in the early market. Late rice spot reached as high as three million at one point. Later, the market finally fell back to 2.7 million at the close due to tight monetary conditions. White rice was 2.65 million, and next-day payment was 3.2 million, an increase of 700,000 to 800,000 yuan compared to yesterday.

Edible Oil

Yesterday, due to the price limit imposed by the Food and Social Affairs Bureau that the price should not exceed yesterday's closing price, the market transaction was also at a standstill. However, as stocks are becoming increasingly scarce, holders are doing their best to raise the price. The off-site price is rising secretly. Soybean oil is 17 million to 16.5 million, raw oil is 16 million to 15.5 million, and rapeseed oil is 14 million, about 3 million yuan higher than the previous day. Soybean cake also rose, with Changzi cake trading at 800,000.

Flour

The previous market failed to catch up with the rising wind of gold notes in the afternoon. Yesterday morning, it quickly caught up. Lao Che once soared past the million mark. Bingchuan was as high as 950,000 yuan. The market closed with tight money, and the price slightly decreased. Lao Che retreated to 975,000 yuan, and Bingchuan was 915,000. After the market closed, the interest rate was as high as 4 yuan or more, and the market was smaller again. Bingchuan last traded at 850,000 yuan. Wheat bran sales were extremely smooth, and the market price caught up with the flour market. Dabao Fuxin rose sharply by 50% and reached a peak of 920,000 near the close.

Grains

The market is still firm. Unborn peanuts are not popular and have fallen by 10%. Soybeans continue to rise due to oil cakes. Stocks are becoming increasingly scarce. Although the position is tight, the market price is still firm. Late soybeans rose to 2.6 million, and Che beans were selling for 2.4 million yuan. Corn Qingbang was absorbed, stimulating an increase of more than 20%. Red grains and sesame trading turned smoothly, and mung beans rose by 10%.

### The Banking Sector Is Experiencing Unprecedentedly Tight Monetary Conditions. Off-Site Gold Prices Are Plunging.

[This Newspaper Dispatch] Yesterday, the gold market experienced a sharp decline. Because the Central Bank suddenly released 1,700 large bars on the previous day, the monetary conditions in the industry were unprecedentedly tight, giving the general speculators a head-on blow. The secret interest rate was as high as 500 yuan, and the highest was even 600 yuan. At 11:15, the gold shops still had more than 200 billion yuan to pay for the Central Bank's gold sale and could not settle it. After the agent repeatedly requested the Central Bank to dredge it, it was changed to applying for a letter to resolve it in the afternoon. Off-site spot trading opened at 26 million, 27 million, and fell sharply to 22 million, 23 million in a sale. The Central Bank continued to entrust Dadecheng and Zhaofengchang to sell in large quantities at 22 million. Because no one accepted it, only 26 large bars were sold. At noon, because the position was still tight, all parties' turnover suddenly failed, and they cut their losses painfully. The low price was once seen at 20 million, 21 million, and finally closed at 21 million, 22 million.

Afternoon next-day trading was not conducted due to the high risk. Until about 6 pm, the missing orders of some small firms were common, and the position could not be made up. The last cash delivery of the day was only 19 million, and some were also sold, already shedding 200,000, a sharp drop of more than 8 million yuan compared to the previous day.

Another dispatch: Yesterday's off-site futures trading was slightly declining because there were large players behind the scenes supporting the market. The morning opened at 30 million, 31 million. Although the situation was tense and benefited the gold market in the middle, the position was extremely tight, and many floating positions were sold. The noon closed down all the way to 27.5 million, 28 million.

Afternoon intraday trading opened at 27.8 million, 28.3 million, and fell to 25.2 million, 25.7 million at the close, with no difference from the previous day's results. The next-day long and short heads posted interest as high as 670 yuan and as low as 470 yuan, and the margin was settled at 29 million.

Another dispatch: Yesterday's jewelry gold fell by 5 million due to the decline in gold prices, and the market was tired and hung low. In the morning, it was as low as 12 million, 25 million, and there was no change in the afternoon. Jewelry silver was stable, still at 270,000, 300,000. For money exchange industry, the current cash was released in the morning at 20 million, 23 million, and fell to 19 million, 21 million in the afternoon, also a drop of more than 7 million yuan compared to the previous day.

### The Gold and Silver Exchange Ratio Drops and the US Dollar Is Tired and Cannot Recover.

[This Newspaper Dispatch] Yesterday, the gold and silver exchange ratio in the Stock Exchange Building dropped step by step. The big head was 46.5, 48.5, and the small head was 45.5. 47.5, the small head was 61, 64, and the Eagle Dragon was 78, 81.

[This Newspaper Dispatch] Yesterday, the off-site US dollar collapsed for the first time and began to recover, because the tight monetary situation was pressing. There was a shortage of orders in the industry, and all parties came out one after another. There was supply and no demand, and the market went downstream all the way. The morning opened at 530,000, 560,000, and fell to 410,000, 440,000. In the afternoon, it was 430,000, 460,000. The next-day trading in the afternoon was deserted. The retail investors only called 400,000 for the day's position, and there was a sale, a drop of 150,000 compared to the previous day.

### Silver Dollar Recedes

[This Newspaper Dispatch] Yesterday's silver dollar arbitrage did not open much, so the local silver dollar was converted into gold yuan for settlement, and there were more than 100,000 transactions from all parties. The road trading was initially flat and then fell. In the morning, the big head still called 450,000, 480,000. Near noon, due to a large amount of reverse flow from Nanjing and Hangzhou, as well as tight money and falling gold prices, there was more supply than demand, and it became almost a sale. In the afternoon, the big head fell into the fourth pass, as low as 390,000, 430,000. The small head fell to 290,000, 330,000, and the Eagle Dragon also fell to 230,000, 260,000. The bill trading only called 450,000, 480,000 for the big head, which was 40,000 less than the previous day.

### Extremely Tight Monetary Conditions

Yesterday morning, due to the large-scale gold sales by the Central Bank yesterday, the city's monetary situation was extremely tight. The daily interest rate of various industries opened at 400 yuan in the morning. At around 10 o'clock, after a wave of falling prices was heard in the market of various industries, the market was slightly flatter and retreated to around 350 yuan. The market interest rate of various industries also opened at an average of between 300 and 400 yuan. The interest rate outside the stock exchange was only 115 yuan and 125 yuan because there was a sale everywhere. The interest rate on the National Bank's telegraphic transfer has been increased to 63 yuan, 33 cents from yesterday, and the daily interest rate has been increased to 51 yuan, 20 cents.

### Foreign Stocks Increase Slightly

The foreign stock market is not as prosperous as the Chinese stock market, and the monetary conditions are extremely tight, and the increase has been slightly seen. Yesterday, the opening price of each stock, Yisha entered at 470,000 and exited at 490,000 yuan. A decrease of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The British Federation entered at 560,000 yuan and exited at 590,000 yuan, a slight increase of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Cotton Yarn Lingering Decline, Cloth Market Unfurls Price Drops

With cotton yarn prices falling, and given the turbulent times, all parties are wary. Yesterday's market started weak and ended fatigued, with fluctuations reaching 20% midway.

42-count Blue Phoenix initially opened high at 14,500,000, but new buyers remained hesitant, and sales were sluggish. The price gradually declined to close at 12,000,000, a sharp drop of 5,000,000.

32-count Silver Moon quickly retreated from 11,000,000 to settle at 9,000,000, ultimately falling by 3,000,000.

12-count Double Horse spot goods opened at 8,800,000 and then plummeted to 7,100,000, before slightly recovering to 7,200,000 at the close, a decrease of 4,000,000 from the previous day. 20-count yarns uniformly fell below the 7,000,000 mark, while 16-count yarns showed some strength, with Brightness and Tiannv each rising by 1,500,000 to 2,000,000. Other yarns all weakened.

Due to the tense situation and the severe credit crunch, the cloth market was filled with anxiety. Buyers showed no interest, and many businesses settled their accounts, leading to widespread price declines in various cloths.

Dragon Head Fine Cloth initially opened at 2,740,000, briefly rising slightly to 2,700,000, but around noon, news of a gold crash to 2,000,000 circulated, coupled with high commissions of forty yuan. The market then plunged, closing at 2,350,000, a sharp drop of 620,000 from the previous evening's close. However, selling continued after the close, with the market still showing weakness.

Four Gentlemen Serge initially opened at 260,000. After reaching a high of 2,750,000, it ultimately retreated to 2,320,000, a sharp drop of 640,000, due to overwhelming pressure. After the close, it fell further to 2,280,000. Due to cost considerations, initial bids for both Dragon Head Fine Cloth and Four Gentlemen Serge were opened high around the 3,000,000 mark, but they eventually softened, with the evening close falling to around 2,780,000.

### Raw Silk Did Not Open Yesterday, Artificial Silk and Silk Goods Still Rise in Quality

The asking price for superior grade raw silk yesterday morning was 13,000,000, but due to the rampant war atmosphere and nervous sentiment, retail investors remained cautious. Despite some interest, bids were only at 11,500,000, resulting in no transactions. There were still no trades by noon.

Artificial silk yesterday morning opened at 6,400,000 for Tianqiao immediate delivery, but no trades occurred. It then opened at 6,000,000, but due to widespread anxiety and a desire to liquidate holdings for cash, the market trended downward. The noon close was at 5,750,000. Today's forward transactions opened at 7,800,000, reaching a high of 8,100,000, but a severe credit crunch both inside and outside the circle pushed the price back down slightly to 7,900,000, an increase of 800,000 from the previous market.

Yesterday, Huaqiang silk fabrics initially rose to the limit at the open, closing at 33,696,000. After the close, off-market trading was quoted at 4,800,000, then traded at 4,500,000, and finally fell to 4,350,000, an increase of 250,000 from the previous noon.

### Cigarette Market Lacks Momentum, Soap, Candles, and Matches Trend Upward

The cigarette market trend yesterday lacked momentum. Commissions were high, with at least 300 yuan per thousand, making it difficult to bear. Actual sales were sluggish, with supply exceeding demand, leading to a downward trend.

Soap, candles, and matches are daily necessities, so demand was strong, leading to a sharp increase of over 40% yesterday. Prices were: White Tin Package 280,000 yuan, Three Cannons 225,000 yuan, Ten-Piece British 285,000 yuan, Twenty-Piece British 115,000 yuan, Ten-Piece Old Knife 260,000 yuan, Big Beautiful 165,000 yuan, Golden Mouse 80,000 yuan, Bank 127,000 yuan, Double Axe 58,000 yuan, Brandy 113,000 yuan, Big Claes 108,000 yuan, Standard 52,000 yuan, Canned Cagliostro 460,000 yuan, Three Five Brand Three Door Lock, Craven 280,000 yuan, Golden Frame 240,000 yuan, Sailor 250,000 yuan, Solid Soap 3,400,000 yuan, Scissors Soap 3,100,000 yuan, Huang Xiangmao 2,400,000 yuan, Beautiful Matches 15,000,000 yuan, Phoenix Matches 14,000,000 yuan.

### Tea Market Trend Still Stable

[Report from this newspaper] According to a certain tea magnate interviewed by our reporter: With the currency devaluing so rapidly, tea farmers in the producing areas, to avoid losses, have long been exchanging tea for gold, silver dollars, and valuables. Recently, businesses in this city have been following suit, leading to a new high in tea prices when converted to gold yuan, creating an unstoppable trend.

Yesterday's market, amid the fluctuating decline of various financial assets, saw the tea market initially remain stable, but it eventually succumbed to pressure and followed the downward trend. However, buyer demand remained high, and the unprecedented credit crunch prevented progress, leaving transactions without momentum.

It was also mentioned that since the victory, tea, a major export of China, has been on the brink of crisis due to exchange rate issues and the impact of discounted sales of tea from Ceylon, Java, and Japan. The current turbulent situation and various other factors are pushing tea into a whirlpool, making the future very uncertain.

### Credit Tight, High Black Market Interest, Chinese Stocks Initially Weak, Then Flat

As peace talks have broken down and the Communist Party has ordered a full-scale attack, the recent bullish trend in Chinese stocks came to an end yesterday. With a large amount of funds flowing in and out of the Central Bank today, credit was extremely tight and black market interest rates were unusually high, around 300-400 yuan per thousand per day. Businesses were wary, with little buying interest. Speculators sold short, causing prices to fall. Consequently, except for Taiwan Sugar, which remained at the limit, other active stocks fell compared to the previous day.

Record yarn opened high at 185 yuan, and short sellers rushed to sell at high prices, causing the market to decline. New sellers, not wanting to be left behind, also sold, resulting in a market dominated by selling pressure after the open. Fortunately, "big player" No. 13 intervened to support the market, stabilizing it somewhat, but it still appeared fragile and soon declined again. Retail investors remained cautious, not daring to act rashly, causing prices to fall further. The market reached a low of 160 yuan, before slightly recovering to close at 165 yuan. The American-Asian market was unusually volatile, with a trend of initially strong then weak. It opened at 4.5 yuan, reached a low of 3.55 yuan, and closed at only 3.8 yuan. Apart from a limited number of stocks such as Commercial Press, most stocks showed weakness.

The market outlook is for unprecedentedly tight credit and soaring black market interest rates. Yesterday afternoon's transactions saw two-day high interest rates, leading to many limit-up moves. Yong Yarn set a new price of 209 yuan. Tongyi, Jinglun, American-Asian, New Asia, Xinyi, Matches, Earth & Mud, National Goods, Commercial, and Taiwan Sugar all reached their limit. However, in the application trading section, shorts were pressured by the credit crunch and the burden of high interest, and they continued to sell. For a time, there were many sellers, with Yong Yarn leading the decline, falling to 139 yuan. Near the close, news of a slight decrease in black market interest rates led to some stabilization. As a result, the application trading prices for Yong Yarn, American-Asian, and Jingfu fluctuated, entirely due to the varying two-day interest rates. Stocks continued to rise by 4 jiao to 35 yuan compared to the previous day, with a total transaction volume of 2.61165 billion shares.

### Market Stroll

— A Spectator

The Market Enters Wartime State, The Rush Turns to Differential Increases

The military authorities announced yesterday that the city has entered a wartime state and declared eight emergency regulations, subject to military control. Speculation, hoarding, and those who disrupt financial stability and prices will be severely punished by military law.

Yesterday, the market improved overall and returned to a stable state, which is a major achievement. The only regret is that the rice market continued to rise wildly, with large transactions reaching 3 million and retail prices even higher than imagined.

Rice is a necessity for people's livelihood. Although the government controls two-thirds of the city's rice supply, the military is above all else during wartime, and military stability is more important than people's food. Therefore, public concern about food can only be addressed by actively collecting reserves from the producing areas. Otherwise, the price of rice rising alone will disrupt the price balance, rendering all efforts to control prices ineffective.

After prices went from rising to falling, the development of the military situation will have a significantly different impact on general goods. As we have repeatedly mentioned in the past, for example, heavy items will be sold off, while light and convenient items will become more popular.

Yesterday, commodity prices were generally weak, except for rice, which rose alone. Is this the beginning of a new trend? It is difficult to judge. However, it can be asserted that the indiscriminate trend of the past will sooner or later be replaced by a differential trend.

The factor of time has a decisive effect on whether a new trend arrives. People in the market are temporarily unable to distinguish and predict in the midst of panic.

We are most concerned about the future of manufacturers in this situation.

Maintaining combat operations and industrial production can be discussed later. What should be of concern now is the weakening of prices, even the potential for a collapse in the prices of some goods, which could threaten the survival of manufacturers.

According to rumors yesterday, some manufacturers in the city have already closed down. This has led to debt disputes and unemployment disputes, which are very serious problems.

The wage problem must be resolved reasonably and recognized by the military and political authorities. The general tendency is to demand the issuance of silver dollars, or, as a second choice, to require wages to be paid in silver dollars.

Recently, there have been strong calls for the issuance of silver dollar certificates. If wages are paid in silver dollars, meaning that they are paid in silver dollar certificates, that would be very inappropriate. Because this would not protect the livelihoods of workers, but would be seen as making fun of them, especially at this time and place, which is absolutely not to be tried.

As for paying wages in silver dollars, the key is 1) the accuracy of the index and 2) the stability of prices after wages are paid, both of which are difficult to predict.

The Central Bank sold more than 1,000 taels of gold the day before yesterday afternoon. Yesterday morning, silver was very tight. It is said that the Central Bank added fuel to the fire, so the tight situation continued into the afternoon.

The result of credit expansion is considered by most to be the main reason for the tight credit. In fact, the problem lies not only in credit expansion, but also in the unexpected and sudden changes in prices. Yesterday, when prices were flat and weak, capital turnover became difficult and credit tightened.

Currently, everything hinges on how the overall situation develops.

In the next few days, there may be military conscription and other actions, which will have a profound impact on the market.

Wildly rising prices in the market are certainly harmful, but if the market stops rising while retail prices continue to rise, stopping the rise will only make industry and commerce more miserable and worsen people's livelihoods.

### Unveiling the Baseball Season, Pandas Play American Sailors Today

[Report from this newspaper] The Panda team, the softball champion that has dominated Shanghai for many years, will play an exhibition game against the players from the US Navy's DeHaven destroyer at the Racecourse at 3:00 PM this afternoon, officially kicking off the city's softball season.

Under the leadership of Liang Fuchu, the "Panda Ambassador," the Panda team has already started practicing to maintain its past reputation in this year's softball season. In terms of the lineup, except for the newly recruited catcher Cao Kejia, who has gone to Taiwan and is replaced by veteran Wang Qingrui, there are no changes to the lineup. The pitcher is still the famous Li Qiteng, known for his infinitely varied pitches. The three Liang brothers will play third base, shortstop, and left field.

The DeHaven team has defeated other American military teams in weekend practice games four or five times. Their batting is strong and far-reaching, unmatched by other teams in Shanghai.

Weighing the strength of the two teams, the Pandas are strong on defense, while the Americans are strong on offense. However, the Chinese players have been working together for years, and under Liang Fuchu's planning, they can also use clever bunts and short hits to attack the opponent's weaknesses. The chances of victory are higher.

In short, today's game will be exciting and will be a great spectacle for the fans who can enter the Racecourse. The Panda lineup is as follows:

Pitcher: Li Qiteng, Catcher: Wang Qingrui

First Base: Mei Yingjun, Second Base: Wen Tianhua

Third Base: Liang Youwen, Shortstop: Liang Yousheng

Left Field: Liang Youyi, Center Field: Zhong Baoluo

Right Field: Lu Zhaosen, Cai Dingzhong, Ba Shun, Zheng Deyao

### Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangzhou Table Tennis Tournament, Decided to Fight in July

[Hong Kong Aviation News] Before setting off to Singapore, the Macau table tennis team of twelve were invited by Mr. Wu Qutiam, Chairman of the Hong Kong General Association, to attend a farewell party on the fifth floor of the Renren Restaurant, and to discuss the triangular inter-city table tennis tournament between Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Macau.

The Macau team is scheduled to play seven matches in Singapore. The order has been arranged by the Singapore General Association: the first match against the Singapore runner-up Jingwu team, the second against the Singapore champion team, and the third against the Northern Malaysia team. In addition, the Singapore United Team, the Malaya National Team, and the Malaya Armed Forces Team will also compete against them, and finally there will be a match in Ipoh.

Regarding the triangular inter-city tournament, in addition to Zhong Rongguang, Wu Qutiam, Zhou Zhenbang, Lai Duanfu, Chen Gongshan, Luo Wenhua, and Liang Tang, who are the backbone of Hong Kong and Macau, Guangzhou also sent representative Xie Yingzhong to attend the discussions.

The following procedures for organizing the inter-city tournament were decided on the spot: (1) Organize a Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Macau Inter-City Table Tennis Tournament Committee to handle all matters related to the inter-city tournament. (2) Each city will send three representatives to serve as committee members. At each meeting, the host city will send one person to serve as the chairman. (3) The inter-city tournament will be held in each city once a year on a rotational basis (i.e., a total of three times). The order of the host cities will be determined by drawing lots. (4) For the men's inter-city tournament, each team will have seven regular players and three substitutes. For the women's tournament, each team will have three regular players and two substitutes. (5) There will be a total of seven matches in the men's tournament, with each match adopting a best-of-three-games format. The winner of each game will score one point, and the first team to reach four points will be considered the winner. There will be three matches in the women's tournament, with the first team to score two points considered the winner. The rules of the game will be in accordance with the world table tennis regulations, with each game scored to 21 points. (6) The game ball will be a hard ball in principle. (7) Each visiting team will bear its own travel and accommodation expenses. All ticket revenue will belong to the host team and will be used for the construction of a gymnasium fund and may not be used for other purposes. (8) Players from each city must have resided in the city for more than three months to be eligible for selection. (9) The prize for the first inter-city tournament will be a sterling silver cup donated by Macau businessman He Xian, which will be awarded to the team with the most wins. If the number of wins is the same, the winner will be determined by the total score; if the scores are still the same, the winner will be determined by the total number of games won. (10) This year's inter-city tournament will run from July to the end of June next year.

After the rules for the inter-city tournament were determined, lots were drawn to determine that the first tournament will be held in Macau, the second in Hong Kong, and the third in Guangzhou. The date of the first tournament will be decided after the Macau team returns from Singapore. With the opening of the inter-city tournament not far away, Hong Kong has decided to have the Competition Department, Zhou Zhenbang and Zhong Zuoyong, be responsible for quickly organizing an all-Hong Kong open men's and women's singles competition to prepare for the selection of inter-city players.

Today, from 5:30 PM, there will be three matches in the men's and women's groups. Ticket prices have been adjusted to 10,000 upstairs, 20,000 downstairs, and 40,000 for reserved seats.

The first match is a girls' junior match between Minli and Ya Team. The latter made their debut in a friendly match the other day, defeating the Power Team 32-24, winning their first victory. Players such as Zhu Min, Sun Fengzhu, Zhu Jiazhen, Jiang Zhelun, and Qian Mengyue are all skilled players and performed outstandingly. Minli is a leading school team and also has considerable strength, but facing the Ya Team, which has gathered famous players, they are likely to have a difficult time.

The second match is a men's consolation match between Friends and Pei Er. Friends has the four knights of Wang Zhengjun, Xia Zhiongzhang, Chen Xiaofa, and Zhang Mingren, who are very powerful. Pei Er has many university athletes who are all young and strong. There will be a fierce battle when they meet.

The final match is a men's semi-final between Ren Yu and McLins, competing for the division leadership. The winner will advance to the top four single round-robin tournament, which is related to the future of the championship, so both sides will put in their best efforts. Ren Yu is the runner-up in this year's league, with Shen Pengju, Sun Guozheng, Yao Wenyu, Wu Xinyun, Wang Huaiting, and Li Zhaohe all having fought on the field for a long time, and Xu Zhongyi's recent form is getting better and better. Zhuang Yirong is making a comeback, and the team's momentum is growing stronger. McLins' foreign soldiers are all strong and sturdy. In a friendly match against Dagong the other day, they not only performed well, but also posed a great threat to Dagong. Tonight's match with Ren Yu can be called evenly matched. The lineups for tonight's six teams are listed below:

(Minli) Jin Baofen, Huang Muzhen, Guo Lifang, Qi Lishao, Zhang Xiaowen, Zhou Xiuzhen, Liu Wenguang, Chen Yanan, Wang Wenxian, Zheng Huizhen.

### Tonight's Class A Table Tennis Match: Reigning Champion Jingwu vs. Qinglian; Last Night Huamei Swept Choubai with a Score of 5-0

In the fourth annual table tennis league, tonight (the 23rd), starting at 7:00 PM, there will be one Class A match and three Class B matches. The Class A match will be moved to the Jingfen Table Tennis Room on the third floor of Cishu Building, featuring Jingwu against Qinglian. Jingwu is the reigning champion with formidable strength and unparalleled resilience. All-China Games table tennis champion Wang Youxin is still under their banner, along with veteran all-rounder Ouyang Wei, and Zhang Fuwei, who has twice defeated first-rate players like Chuan Qifang. Their skills are superior and captivating, giving them the greatest confidence in winning this year's championship. Qinglian is a level below and hardly their equal. In tonight's encounter, there is concern they will be completely defeated. Their only hope lies with team captain Liu Baotai, who, if able to avoid head-on clashes in the roster and maintain an indomitable fighting spirit, might break the duck egg record through a lucky opportunity.

The three Class B matches are of less importance. Xingguang, Xinyi, and Chouhong are slightly stronger and should advance smoothly. The order of matches and the rosters of the two Class A teams are listed below:

Jingwu vs. Qinglian (Class A) 7:00 PM Jingfen

Xingguang vs. Mingxing (Class B Group 3) 8:30 PM Jingzong

Xinyi vs. Hujing (Class B Group 2) 7:00 PM Xinyi

Chouhong vs. Jinmen (Class B Group 3) 7:00 PM Chouye

(Jingwu) Zhang Fuwei (Captain), Ouyang Wei, Yang Kaiyun, Wang Youxin, Li Longbiao, Chen Zengliang, Gao Hongxing, Shui Hangao.

(Qinglian) Liu Baotai (Captain), Wang Zongze, Cao Taichang, Li Peiran, Liang Manhui, Du Boru, Shen Lunzhang, Tu Youci.

The Class A match between Huamei and Choubai the night before was held at the auditorium of the Chouye Guild Hall, drawing over 400 spectators. The atmosphere was lively. Chen Linsheng, the general director of the league, also attended to assist as a referee. Choubai, knowing they could not defeat the brave Huamei, still faced the match with high spirits and a mindset of observation. Female player Sun Meiying even took the lead, receiving applause and cheers from the crowd. However, ultimately, she was unable to withstand the pressure and was defeated by Huamei's Li Zongpei. In the remaining four matches, Choubai suffered consecutive defeats. Veteran Kong Hanchen, however, with his stable smashes, posed a significant threat to Huamei's chopper Wang Jiuqing. Jiuqing eventually prevailed after a long chopping battle, winning 2-1. Huamei's main player Xue Xuchu did not exert his full strength. Young player Xue Weichu, making his debut in a major match, showed great effort and promising potential. In particular, Lu Hanjun, seasoned from countless battles, remained sharp and in top form. His opponent, newcomer Zhao Zhenyuan, lacked the skill to resist and had to retreat. As a result, Huamei decisively defeated Choubai with a score of 5-0. In the six Class B matches, the intense battle between the United team of Group 2 and the Public Transport team saw veteran Zhu Jianzhang unexpectedly defeated 2-1 by Public Transport's main player Sheng Risheng. However, United ultimately defeated Public Transport 3-2, which can be considered a blessing in disguise. In Group 3, the Jingwei youngsters suffered a painful defeat against Nongji. Team captain Mang Peijun underperformed, failing to secure a win that was within reach, which ultimately affected the overall situation. As a result, Nongji defeated Jingwei 4-1. The results of the Class A matches and the results of the Class B matches are listed below:

(Huamei) Score (Choubai)

Li Zongpei 21-17 21-18 Sun Meiying

Xue Xuchu 21-16 21-18 Yang Changxi

Wang Jiuqing 21-16 17-21 21-11 Kong Hanchen

Lu Hanjun 21-6 21-9 Zhao Zhenyuan

Xue Weichu 21-16 21-11 Liu Zhenqiu

Class B Results

Zhaoshang defeated Hujing (Class B Group 2) 5-0

United defeated Public Transport (Class B Group 2) 3-2

Chouhong defeated Jiaolong (Class B Group 3) 4-1

Nongji defeated Jingwei (Class B Group 3) 4-1

Lingdui defeated Lulian (Class B Group 1) 5-0

### Two Eccentric Guides of the American University Basketball Champion Team

— Qi Gong Shang

The Kentucky University team and the St. Lowis University basketball team are excellent teams in the United States. The former is coached by the famous Adolph Rupp, and the latter is guided by the famous Ed Hickey. The Kentucky team was the champion of the 1945 National Invitation Tournament. This team does not have giants, but it shows a rapid, powerful, and accurate shooting force. St. Louis defeated Kentucky 42-40 in the 1949 season to win the Sugak Bowl championship. This team is made up of five giants and relies on giant players. Both teams are skilled, and the individual skills between the players are excellent, and the instructors are well-coached and guided to achieve great success. The following are the theories of these two famous guides, specially compiled for basketball instructors and newcomers to use as reference materials.

Adolph Rupp

He is a professor at Kentucky University. Except for 1946-1947, he has served at the university for 16 years. The basketball team he has guided has played a total of 283 games, and only lost 64 games. Until now, he is still reviewing the key to these 64 failures. In a period of more than five years, the team has won 45 consecutive important games.

Kentucky's athletes are allowed to receive accommodation, tuition exemption, books, laundry, and a monthly allowance of 10 yuan per athlete under the League Association regulations, so Mr. A has the right to allocate 15 free places for athletes to his basketball players every year.

Mr. A can be regarded as the professor with the highest salary for basketball guidance in the United States, with an annual salary of 8,500 yuan.

In 1930, he created a new tactic. At that time, teams in Kentucky and other southern schools focused on the "slow attack method", which was called the "Illinois system". Mr. A created a new style and announced that he wanted to create a "fast attack method" tactic.

When Mr. A decided to guide the new tactics, the editor of the school's "Weekly" sports column wrote that Mr. A's attempt may not be successful, holding a doubtful attitude, because the team was already proficient in the "slow attack method". Once the team changed its course, it was feared that it would be difficult to control the team. In the Southern Championship finals, the team was defeated by the Maryland team with a score of 29-27 in the last 40 seconds.

After hearing the news of the defeat, the editor of the sports column wrote a commentary with tears in his eyes, believing that the athletes had done their best to contribute to the alma mater. Although they were defeated, they were still glorious. This was because the team had not achieved 100% success after adopting the new tactics. Even if they unfortunately lost the opportunity to win the championship, they had made significant progress and amazing performances in tactics.

Adolph Rupp is 46 years old. In 1937, he suffered from spinal paralysis. For a period of time, the use of his left hand was not flexible. He had to use his right hand to reach into the left pocket of his pants to get things. After a famous doctor, Herbert Lingdong, performed surgery, he gradually recovered, but he still had to wear a copper and leather girdle and sit on a chair to guide the team. Now he has fully recovered.

Mr. A is proficient in guiding the team to use the screen attack technique. The team uses a pure and skilled formation. The players' movements are tacitly cooperative. Their skills are beyond the reach of other teams.

In terms of defense, Mr. A has long abandoned the zone defense system and advocated the use of man-to-man defense. According to his theory, when the opponent uses a formation to attack, and the defender adopts a passive zone defense system, he is always in a passive position and is often preempted. The attacker controls the ball and makes quick and accurate passes left and right, forcing the defender to move, being restrained and separated. All are passive. When there is a gap in the defender's area, the attacker will rush in from that gap to make a contribution. This passive defense method is difficult to win.

Mr. A teaches a course on "Advanced Basketball Skills", which is most suitable for people who will be serving as instructors in the future to choose.

### My Forgetfulness

— Ai Yang

I often like to clip banknotes, especially new large banknotes, in books as bookmarks. But when I need to use them, I often have to search through the books on the shelf, one by one, before I can find the "treasury" from not long ago. The doctor said that I must stop smoking, stop writing, take tonics, and get more sleep. Otherwise, "the consequences of this forgetfulness are unimaginable," and so on. At the time, I was terrified when I heard this, and quickly extinguished the remaining half of the cigarette in my hand. But soon after, when I repeatedly "tried hard" to recall the doctor's advice on how to take care of myself, I couldn't remember anything at all. I had another case of forgetfulness!

Under the lamp, friends were discussing prices and lamenting that the big head had risen to 400,000. Suddenly, A asked how much the big head sold for on this day last month? Four or five people tried their best to recall, but no one could "recall" it. A then asked what the rice price was three days ago? Some said 2 million, some said 2.5 million. Checking the newspaper, no one answered correctly. The conversation then moved from Gold Yuan to Legal Tender. I asked: What was the highest denomination of Legal Tender? Everyone opened their eyes and mouths, not knowing the answer. Everyone said strangely: Why is our memory so bad?

At this point, I was very happy in my heart—a little bit of gloating. It turns out that I am not the only one suffering from forgetfulness.

Who makes everyone forgetful?

C said: It's all the fault of that printing press.

However, the printing press seems to be suffering from forgetfulness as well. Less than a year ago, the Legal Tender went from thousands to ten thousands, to hundreds of thousands, millions, ten millions… and finally collapsed. And today, the Gold Yuan is also going from thousands to ten thousands, to fifty thousands, to one hundred thousands…, and the speed is as fast as if it is "familiar with the road." The printing press is only focused on shipping quickly and has forgotten the past events of the collapse of the Legal Tender.

I thought: Anyway, everyone is suffering from forgetfulness, just like everyone is keeping Western-style hair, what's so strange about it? At least, I am forgetful, so I don't remember yesterday's prices, and I even forget the current prices. In a daze, I don't have to shudder at "it's gone up several times again!" Isn't this a great blessing?

### The Wisdom of Dogs

— Sang

Someone accidentally brought up the cleverness of dogs, and one person told a story: A family once had a very clever hunting dog. One night, there was a sudden fire in the house. The fire was very fierce, and everyone was unable to save anything, even the child in the bedroom. At this time, the hunting dog rushed into the house and soon brought the child out. The owner was so happy that he shed tears. But suddenly, the dog rushed into the flames again. Everyone was surprised and worried about it, but it rushed out again. The flames had burned its fur, but it was holding the fire insurance policy in its mouth!

### Huaiyin's Noodles

— Chen Yixian

Huaiyin County in Jiangbei was called Qingjiangpu before the Republic of China. Before the Tianjin-Pukou and Pinghan Railways were built and maritime transport was unblocked, the area was a transportation hub for north-south traffic. Travelers going north and south all changed boats and cars here. There were also two administrative agencies, the River Police and the Grain Transport Police. The extravagance of the river workers' diet was famous throughout the world. Since the Yellow River moved north and the grain transport was changed to maritime transport, and railways and steamships gradually rose, Qingjiangpu gradually declined in the late Qing Dynasty. However, Huai cuisine and Huai snacks still enjoy a high reputation to this day. In the early Republic of China, when I was drinking in Feiyuan (Gan Hanshen's garden), I once ate hot noodle dumplings made by the old Zhu Jiangcun's Huai chef. The skin was thin and the filling was fresh. Compared with Yang snacks, it had a different flavor. In Beiping, there is a kind of handcart that sells hot noodle dumplings. There is a steamer on the cart, steaming with hot air. With a shout, not only ordinary people surround it to eat, but also servants of large mansions hold utensils to buy it. This is one of the snacks of the old capital, and I am very fond of it. Last year, a small newspaper reported that Dr. Mei liked to eat hot noodle dumplings and specially hired a chef from Beiping to make this snack. I don't know that Huai dumplings are even better than those made in Beiping.

In the 20th year of the Republic of China, there was a great flood in the Yangtze River area. At that time, Hu Pu'an was the Director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department. Because I had helped Feng Xu with disaster relief, he asked me to investigate the disasters in the six counties of Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Baoying, Huaicheng, Huaiyin, and Siyang. I went with Commissioner Yuan, who was sent by the Ministry of Interior. In the hot weather of July, we investigated the disaster to the "Hexia" town in Huaiyin. There was a teahouse called "Wenlou" in the town, which was very famous for selling soup dumplings. We went to taste them. The way they were made was different from those in Zhenjiang and Yangzhou. Those in Zhenjiang and Yangzhou were small, but these were especially large. A cage was placed on the table, and when the lid was opened, there were more than a dozen. The waiter used his fingers to lift the top of each one, reaching two or three inches high, and placed it on a five-inch plate in front of each person. The soup dumpling flattened out, almost occupying the entire plate. We bit a corner of it and slowly sipped it. The broth was abundant and exceptionally delicious. Those who were not good at eating it would splash the broth all over their sleeves. At that time, a certain gentleman from the county government led us to eat this famous snack, saying, "There is a story about eating Huaiyin soup dumplings, which is very funny. People in the inland areas eat morning tea or afternoon tea in hot weather, mostly shirtless. A foreigner who was eating this for the first time bit a hole in it, and unfortunately the broth splashed on the back of a diner next to him, the oil dripping. The waiter intended to wipe it with a towel, but the diner told him to wait a moment. The waiter asked why, and the person said, "He hasn't eaten it yet!" This shows the characteristics of this famous snack in Huaiyin, which is different from the ordinary small soup dumplings in Zhenjiang and Yangzhou.

### Can You Hold It?

— Dong Sheng

### Foreign Objects in the Human Body

— Zhu Zhenjiang

I happened to see in Shenbao's Free Talk a report about a prisoner in a certain place in France who, in order to commit suicide, swallowed two can openers, a pair of fire tongs that had been broken into ten pieces, five four-inch-long nails, as well as spiral nails and broken pieces of glass from wine bottles. As a result, he was rescued and did not die.

Regarding this kind of example, it is often seen in medicine. All these kinds of things are called "foreign objects" or "foreign bodies." The most common is accidentally swallowing dentures, as well as swallowing buttons, gold rings, etc. In Winnipeg, Canada, there was a Chinese overseas Chinese who accidentally swallowed a knife and fork with his food while eating. However, when the abdomen was opened, only the knife was seen and the fork was not, which was considered a strange story.

In the London Museum of Medical History, I saw an egg cup (about seven or eight centimeters high), which was swallowed by a sixty-year-old man thirty-five years ago. He felt a blockage in the ileocecal region and had his abdomen opened to remove it. I also saw that a ten-year-old girl had many accidentally swallowed objects removed from her stomach after it was opened (about one or two hundred nails, each one inch and half an inch long, as well as safety pins, feathers, and other scattered objects). As a result, she was also cured. The foreign objects on display in the museum also included scissors, pieces of glass, thermometers, insects, knives, copper coins, glasses, watches, etc., a dazzling array that could not be counted.

Regarding examples of swallowing a particularly large number of foreign objects, according to Eastman Cheesy, there was a mental patient who swallowed a total of 157 sharp pieces of glass, each five centimeters long, 120 brass safety pins, 150 rusty iron needles, three needles, 15 pieces of iron of varying sizes, brass, boot buckles, curtain hooks, etc. However, after eight months, they were all excreted through the anus.

In the past, anyone in China who collected ginseng or managed a treasury often handed ginseng and gold jewelry to others and hid them in the rectum through the anus and brought them out. This can certainly be regarded as a type of foreign object.

When surgeons perform abdominal surgery, if they do not pay special attention to knives, scissors, tweezers, gauze, etc., there is often a risk of accidentally sewing them into the abdomen.

If foreign objects enter the digestive system, laxatives must not be taken to prevent perforation of the stomach and intestines, leading to peritonitis. It is more appropriate to swallow them with rice balls or potatoes. The best method, of course, is to perform an X-ray examination to determine the location and then perform abdominal surgery. However, I have also encountered a strange thing. After a patient swallowed a gold ring, it was confirmed without error on X-ray, but when the abdomen was opened, there was no such thing in the stomach and intestines. It turned out that he had had a bowel movement once and had already excreted the ring.

### Loss of Decency

— Xiao Kangshi

According to a report in this newspaper on the 20th: "A teacher from a provincial high school in Taipei resigned due to financial pressures and became a worker in the US Consulate in Taiwan, responsible for wiping windows and sweeping floors, with a monthly salary of several million Taiwan dollars converted from US dollars."

The teacher was willing to become a coolie, doing menial work, because the salary was not enough, which really fits a common saying, called "loss of decency"!

After years of hard study and teaching others, the treatment he received was so meager that he could not support his family. But once he practiced "loss of decency", he could live without worry. This era is truly the year of "loss of decency". What else is there to say?

### Food Grand View Garden

— Jing Xin

Eating is not just about filling your stomach, but also about whether the taste is good or not. Due to the different local specialties, there are also differences in the taste of food. Every place, every nation, has a special flavor of food. In several large cities, where people from all directions gather, you can taste the special delicacies of various places; but in a restaurant, you cannot eat the flavors of different places.

In New York, there is a "Cui Shi Hotel" that collects the essence of food from various ethnic groups and makes dishes of various flavors for guests. New York has a population of four million, half of whom have parents who are foreigners or grew up abroad. These many main displays allow the Cui Shi Hotel to do very good business.

When you step into the Cui Shi Hotel and sit down, the waiter will send you a menu. You will be surprised when you see the menu. It is a thick book with densely printed words; if you are not prepared in advance and don't know which dish to order, it will take a lot of time just to flip through it. In that "menu", there are more than 25,000 kinds of dishes, including French-style Napoleon pancakes, Italian beeswax spaghetti, German-style steaks, Spanish lettuce, Norwegian seafood... as well as Indian cuisine, Turkish cuisine, Japanese cuisine, everything. Chinese cuisine is world-renowned, of course, it is indispensable. The menu also lists egg foo young and chop suey. Can these two dishes represent Chinese cuisine? That is impossible to judge except by the Chinese themselves.

The layout of the Cui Shi Hotel, in addition to a large restaurant that can accommodate 5,000 diners, also has many rooms. The layout of the rooms is not only different, but also shows the scenery of various places. Some have a tropical atmosphere, with lush palms and coconut groves painted on the walls, and the colors are matched to look like summer. That is where you eat tropical dishes. Some are decorated as cold landscapes, with artificial ice and cotton-made snow, adding to the cold atmosphere. That is where you eat northern dishes. Guests not only eat special side dishes, but also feel as if they are in a foreign country, which adds a lot of fun to the meal.

Although the diners at the Cui Shi Hotel can all speak English, in order to make the local atmosphere more intimate, the waiters try their best not to speak English, but to speak the local language. Therefore, the waiters are specially trained to speak many different languages. The most can speak more than 40 different dialects. To others, they are all linguistic experts.

To cook different dishes from various places, you must have local chefs so that the taste of the side dishes will not change. Therefore, the Cui Shi Hotel's more than 100 chefs include more than 70 different nationalities. Some of them are masters among the chefs in that area. Several chefs are divided into a group and are responsible for the side dishes of that area. Therefore, although there are many dishes on the menu, each chef only cooks a few kinds.

Raw materials such as fish, meat, vegetables, fruits, and seasonings, in addition to the ordinary ones, are also purchased from the local area. The Cui Shi Hotel has a large storage room that hides various products from all over the world. Almost everything that can be eaten can be found there. The Cui Shi Hotel is truly a collection of the world's food.
