### The Capital City Filled with an Atmosphere of Unity; Peace Talk Contents Under Discussion; Sun Ke Arrives in Nanjing, Zhang Qun and Cheng Qian About to Come East

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] The important consultation that Acting President Li invited central and local officials to Nanjing to hold has, in fact, largely begun. After the Shanghai Peace Delegation arrived in Nanjing from Peiping on the 27th and President Sun Ke returned to Nanjing from Guangzhou on the 28th, this consultation became more concrete. Once Zhang Qun and Cheng Qian arrive and participate in the talks, a conclusion can be reached. People close to Acting President Li strongly denied the convening of a conference on the 28th, but did not deny that consultations were underway. It is said that this is Acting President Li inviting leaders from various regions to Nanjing to talk after taking office and touring the south, and there is no formal meeting. Furthermore, the content of the discussions is very broad. The important meetings at the Acting President's official residence reported in the newspapers in recent days did not occur. If there were any, they were only occasional gatherings of important officials for talks. According to sources, there are currently two main problems for the government: (1) How to enhance internal unity to ensure consistency of opinions and concentration of power; and (2) How to start negotiations with the Chinese Communists to achieve the goal of comprehensive peace. Regarding the former, Acting President Li's previous southern tour yielded significant gains. This gathering of important officials in Nanjing to exchange views can further lead to a consistent position. Internal unity within the government is also of great importance for peace talks. Chinese Communist broadcasts have repeatedly mentioned differences of opinion within the government, and on the 27th, there was a broadcast of the so-called "struggle between Li Zongren and Sun Ke for leadership of the Kuomintang," which has now been disproven. Regarding the latter, Shao Lizi's participation in the Shanghai Peace Delegation's trip to Peiping in a private capacity has greatly benefited the government's decision-making. With formal negotiations about to begin, the government seems to need to be fully prepared. In fact, these consultations have already begun. Acting President Li has twice invited President of the Control Yuan Yu Youren to long talks in recent days, first consulting this veteran of the party and the country on major policy decisions. President of the Legislative Yuan Tong Guanxian and Vice President of the Executive Yuan Wu Tiecheng have also paid several visits to discuss matters. After the Shanghai Peace Delegation returned to Nanjing on the 27th, Acting President Li had three separate talks with Shao Lizi by the evening of the 28th. After the banquet on the evening of the 28th, Acting President Li kept He Yingqin and Bai Chongxi to talk until late at night. Acting President Li discussed Shao's report on the Chinese Communists' capabilities and Mao Zedong's strengths in detail with He and Bai. After Sun Ke arrived in Nanjing on the 28th, he went to Acting President Li's official residence at 5 p.m. to pay a visit. Zhang Zhizhong was also present, and the long conversation lasted until 7 p.m. It is expected that after Zhang Qun and Cheng Qian arrive in Nanjing, these consultations will be accelerated, with the hope of reaching a concrete conclusion within two or three days. After Shao Lizi returns from Peiping, how the government will promote the formal start of peace talks will also be finalized during these consultations.

[Our Report] Well-informed sources have rumored that when the Peace Delegation returned to Nanjing, it did bring back several preconditions put forward by the Chinese Communists. It is said that among them are demands using Hankou and Xi'an as leverage, namely, that Hankou and Xi'an must first be "liberated" by the Chinese Communists. Observers believe that if this is the case, it would be too harsh on Acting President Li's sincerity, because Central China's military affairs are a key area where Li and Bai Chongxi can personally command, and it would not be easy to give up lightly.

[Our Chongqing Dispatch on the 28th] The weather was bad on the 28th, and Zhang Qun changed his flight to Nanjing to another day.

[Our Changsha Dispatch on the 28th] Cheng Qian originally planned to take Zhang Qun's special "Ziqiang" plane from Chongqing via Changsha to Nanjing on the 28th. However, on the evening of the 27th, a military aircraft made a forced landing at Changbu Jieshan Airport in Changsha due to insufficient fuel, and the runway was damaged. It was temporarily impossible to land, so he was unable to travel with Zhang. Cheng plans to go to Hengyang to fly to Nanjing instead.

### Internal Decisions on Candidates for Peace Talks on Both Sides; The Government Has Learned of the Chinese Communist Representative List, but Does Not Want to Reveal It Before Publication

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] With the prospect of peace talks beginning, the general public is paying close attention. Of particular importance is the selection of representatives for both sides to conduct the negotiations. The Chinese Communist side has already determined its candidates, and government officials have also learned of their list, but are unwilling to reveal it before the Chinese Communists officially announce it. As for whether the government's representatives will still be the previously announced Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Huang Shaohong, and Zhong Tianxin, the authorities are also considering it. Qualified sources have revealed that there may be slight changes in this selection, and the number of people is likely to increase slightly.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] The four members of the Peace Delegation, Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, Zhang Shizhao, and Shao Lizi, continued to receive a warm welcome from all sides in Nanjing on the 28th. The Capital Hotel of the China Travel Service, where the Peace Delegation is staying, was filled with visitors in the morning and afternoon on the 28th, expressing their condolences for the hard work of the four elder statesmen of peace. In the morning, Ju Zheng, Bai Chongxi, Huang Shaohong, Gan Jiaxin, Huang Yuren, and others visited one after another. At noon, Zhang Zhizhong went to visit and talk for nearly an hour. In the afternoon, Vice President of the Executive Yuan Wu Tiecheng, Huang Bodu, and more than ten members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan also visited. At noon, the delegation attended a banquet hosted by the Presidents of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan, Tong Guanxian and Yu Youren. In the evening, they attended a joint banquet hosted by the President and Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng.

### Postal Service to Communist Areas May Resume Within a Week

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] The first practical result of the talks between Yan Huiqing's delegation and the Chinese Communist leaders will be the resumption of air transport to Peiping. It is understood that one of the concessions made by the Communists is to allow the Central Air Transport Corporation to begin mail transport soon, with passenger transport to be restored later. At least for the time being, no other airline planes will be allowed to go to Peiping. According to very reliable sources, the China National Aviation Corporation and the Civil Air Transport Brigade will not be allowed to fly to Peiping for the time being because these companies have investments from "American imperialists." Central Air Transport Corporation sources said that Peiping mail transport will resume within three to seven days.

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] Various departments and bureaus in Nanjing have been ordered to start accepting and sending mail to the Communist areas from the 28th. Registered express letters and small parcels can be accepted for Peiping and Tianjin, while only ordinary letters can be accepted for other areas.

[Our Report] The issue of full postal service between the Nationalists and Communists, after being discussed by the Peace Delegation in Peiping, has been agreed to in principle by the Communist side. As for the technical issues, the Communist side hopes that this side will send personnel to Peiping to negotiate directly. The Directorate General of Posts is currently considering candidates, and they will depart for Peiping by air as soon as a decision is made.

### The Communist Party Plots to Control Taiwan

[Our Report] New York 28th Radio: Hong Kong News, well-informed people from Taiwan said here that the Communist Party will certainly demand management of Taiwan when the Nationalists and Communists hold peace talks in the future. There are about 10,000 Communist Party members in Taiwan now, who are engaging in various activities, demanding management of the island. The Taiwanese people said that Xie Xuehong (transliteration), a female Communist leader in Taiwan, has gone to North China to negotiate. People here related to the Taiwanese Independence Movement say that recently about 200 "White Russians" have gone to Taiwan from China. They are ostensibly stateless refugees, but it is generally believed that there must be secret Soviet Union staff among them. That side of the people said that among the 6.5 million people in Taiwan, neither the Kuomintang nor the Communist Party are popular, but they are eager for the United States to clearly express its policy toward Taiwan. Those people welcome the views expressed by the United States that Kuomintang people should not go to Taiwan to take refuge, because the status of Taiwan has not yet been formally decided. Those people also said that if the Communist Party controls Taiwan, it will inevitably cause an event similar to the February 28, 1947 anti-Kuomintang riot.

[United Press Tokyo Dispatch on the 28th] The Taiwan Residents' Association in Tokyo made a new demand for Taiwan's independence on the second anniversary of the "February 28" Incident in Taiwan.

### Presidents of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan Hosted a Banquet to Welcome the Four Elder Statesmen of Peace; Yan and Shao Responded, Hoping to Overcome Difficulties

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] The President of the Control Yuan, Yu Youren, and the President of the Legislative Yuan, Tong Guanxian, jointly hosted a banquet for the Peace Delegation Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, Zhang Shizhao, and Shao Lizi and their entourage at the International Club at noon on the 28th. Government officials and some members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan were invited to attend. President Sun Ke, who had just arrived in Nanjing from Guangzhou, was also invited to participate on an ad hoc basis. The banquet was originally scheduled to begin at 12 noon, but because the two Presidents Yu and Tong and some government officials went to the airport to greet President Sun, it did not begin until 1:30 p.m. During the banquet, President Yu gave a speech, expressing his deep respect for the hard work of the four gentlemen of the Peace Delegation in their efforts for peace. He also expressed his apologies for not being able to arrive on time. President Tong said that the Peace Delegation's return south and President Sun Ke's arrival at this time have brought spring to the capital. Peace is now the unanimous desire of the people of the whole country and is necessary for the country today. The four representatives are working for peace, which is truly admirable and inspiring. He hoped that everyone would work for peace to promote its realization. Then, Yan and Shao of the Peace Delegation also stood up to speak. Yan, as a veteran diplomat, recalled diplomatic examples and emphasized that peace is a success, and failure to achieve peace is a failure. Yan said that after the "September 18th" Incident, he once met with Shigemitsu Mamoru and said to Shigemitsu: "Our diplomacy is a failure if we fail to achieve peace." Yan further said in a poetic tone: "Nanjing now has a Peace Gate, and Peiping also has a Peace Gate. We hope that the two Peace Gates can be connected so that the people can come and go freely." Shao Lizi gave a brief report on the origin and process of the Peace Delegation's trip to Peiping and concluded by saying, "Although there are still many difficulties in the future of peace talks, the hope is great." He hoped to overcome the difficulties and realize the hope. The banquet ended at 3 p.m. Those invited to attend today included Ju Zheng, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Zhizhong, He Yingqin, Xu Yongchang, Bai Chongxi, Gu Zhutong, Huang Shaohong, Wu Zhongxin, Zhong Tianxin, Wu Shangying, Gan Jiehou, Qiu Changwei, Li Chongshi, Chen Kewen, Fan Yuyu, Huang Yuren, Gu Fengxiang, Wang Xiangchen, Tian Yup, Cheng Siyuan, Wei Yongcheng, and others, totaling more than 30 people.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng hosted a banquet for the Peace Delegation Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, Zhang Shizhao, and Shao Lizi on the evening of the 28th, inviting Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Tong Guanxian, Bai Chongxi, He Yingqin, Huang Shaohong, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhong Tianxin, and others to attend. During the banquet, they exchanged views on the peace talks and did not disperse until 10 p.m.

### Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, and Zhang Shizhao, Three Members of the Peace Delegation, Will Stay in Nanjing Today and Return to Shanghai Tomorrow

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, and Zhang Shizhao, three members of the Peace Delegation, were originally scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 1st. However, because President Sun and various parties asked them to stay for another day, they have decided to postpone their return to Shanghai by plane until the 2nd. Lei Zhongren, the representative of the Central Air Transport Corporation in the delegation, returned to Shanghai on the night of the 28th. He is going to Hong Kong for personal matters.

Then, Sun shook hands with Yu, Bai, and others who came to greet him one by one and exchanged greetings. Sun wore a dark gray suit, a dark green overcoat, and dark glasses. When reporters asked Sun to make a statement, Wan Junhe, a specialist from the Information Bureau, stated on Sun's behalf that President Sun had already made a detailed statement in Guangzhou and had nothing to add today. He would arrange another date for further talks. After President Sun was photographed with the two Presidents Yu and Tong at the airport, he was invited to go to the International Club to attend the joint banquet hosted by the two Presidents for the Peace Delegation.

### Two Major Responsibilities of the Reopened Legislative Yuan: Promote Peace and Reform Politics; Today's Regular Meeting Is Postponed; The Second Meeting Will Be Held on the Fourth; Sun Ke Will Attend to Make a Supplementary Report on the Policy Guidelines

[Our South China Dispatch on the 28th] The third session of the Legislative Yuan reopened in Nanjing on the morning of the 28th as scheduled in accordance with the Constitution. A total of 211 legislators who had arrived in Nanjing to report were present before the meeting, and 178 people attended the first meeting. No proposals were discussed at the meeting, waiting for others from various regions to arrive and participate. The weather was sunny and bright on the morning of the 28th. The National Assembly Hall, which had been deserted for two months, once again showed a noisy atmosphere. The members, being the first gathering of the year, attended promptly and exchanged greetings with colleagues they had not seen for two months. The meeting opened at 9:35 a.m., completing the reporting items in just 20 minutes. President Tong presided over the meeting and gave a speech of about 10 minutes, making the promotion of peace and political reform the major responsibilities of this session. In addition, the secretariat only read the minutes of the 33rd meeting of the second session, which were passed without objection. After President Tong gave a speech, he reported that the Yuan, in accordance with past regulations, meets twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays. This meeting was held ahead of schedule on the 28th to comply with the provisions of the Constitution. Now, the report is received that the members from various regions are all on the way. Can the regular meeting date on March 3 be postponed once to wait for all colleagues to arrive? The audience applauded. The regular meeting on the morning of the 1st was decided to be postponed, and the Program Committee was scheduled to meet at 10:00 a.m. on the 1st to discuss the agenda for the second meeting. It is understood that as of the 28th, no proposals have been submitted by the members, only a few legal proposals have been submitted by the government.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] The Legislative Yuan is scheduled to hold its second meeting on the 4th. Because President Sun Ke has arrived in Nanjing from Guangzhou, Sun will attend at that time to make a supplementary report on the policy guidelines.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian said in his speech at the first meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 28th: "Today is a bright spring day, and the holding of the first meeting of the third session of our Yuan symbolizes the bright and auspicious future of the country. It has been two months since our Yuan adjourned. During these two months, President Chiang resolutely retired to advocate peace, and Acting President Li took on the arduous task of promoting peace. This is a turning point in the survival of the country. At this time, the Legislative Yuan is reconvening in accordance with the law. The importance of our responsibility and the people's high expectations are self-evident. Today's century is the century of the people. Only by following the will of the people can the country have a way out, and only by exerting the power of the people can the government have power. What do the people hope for now? Undoubtedly, it is peace and political reform. The so-called peace is not stopping the current small bloodshed and preparing for the future large bloodshed. The so-called political reform is not just a change in government personnel, but the establishment of an incorruptible and capable political system that can truly represent the people and seek their welfare. How to ensure that freedom, democracy, and progress can be reasonably guaranteed, and how to put the country on the path of long-term stability and security, this is the mission that history has given to today's politicians, and it is also the important responsibility that our Legislative Yuan bears. From my personal point of view, this session of the Legislative Yuan is different from the previous two sessions. First, in today's situation where the people urgently need peace to resolve the crisis, we are discussing national affairs. Time does not allow us to discuss minor issues. Second, the agenda of this meeting seems to be more political than legal, requiring us to concentrate our efforts and study the most urgent major issues for the country. For example, how to promote comprehensive peace, how to determine future policy guidelines, how to increase administrative efficiency, how to stabilize finance and finance, how to improve the lives of soldiers and civilians, and so on. Our colleagues come from all corners and all levels of society, and we all have a deep understanding of the people's demands and the country's needs. I believe that with our collective wisdom, calm thinking, and sincere unity, we will be able to express public opinion, supervise the government, reverse the current crisis, and lay a foundation for lasting peace for the country. This is the common understanding of our colleagues and the hope of the people of the whole country. On the occasion of today's first gathering, I would like to offer a few words for the reference of all members."

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch on the 28th] The Legislative Yuan reopened in Nanjing on the 28th, and the legislators staying in Guangzhou still insisted on opposing it. Most advocated postponing the reopening and deciding the reopening location by voting. Some legislators believe that as long as the government can achieve "glorious peace" as soon as possible, the time and location of the meeting are not a problem. There are currently more than 80 legislators staying in Guangzhou. According to qualified observers, although they are doing their best to advocate reopening in Guangzhou, the current number of people attending the meeting is small, and the possibility of singing a "counter-drama" is very small.

### Nanjing and Shanghai Security Agencies Cracked a Conspiracy of Terrorist Riot; Attempt to Detain Central Leaders to Create Chaos; Those Arrested Include Female National Representatives and Senior Officials of the Supervisory Agency and Police Department

[Our Report] According to information obtained from extremely reliable sources, the Nanjing security authorities cracked a plot half a month ago to subvert the government and affect the entire political situation; if this plan had been realized, the face of the political situation today would be different, and Nanjing and Shanghai might have fallen into the hands of rioters. The instigator of this riot plot was the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee led by Li Jishen. They wanted to use riots and coups to detain Acting President Li, Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong, Commander of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Command Tang Enbo, Commander of the Capital Garrison Zhang Yaoming, Commander of the Military Police Zhang Dang, Director of the Capital Police Department Huang Zhenwu, Mayor of Nanjing Teng Jie, and other government leaders in Nanjing, in order to overthrow the Nationalist government, control the military headquarters, and welcome the Communist army across the river as future political capital. However, due to the lack of secrecy, it was detected by the Nanjing security authorities, who immediately took effective emergency response actions to suppress it in time, arresting Meng Shiheng (a member of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, currently a supervisor of the Supervisory Commissioner's Office in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang region), Xu Zhiyuan, and Xia Huaying, a female National Assembly representative who participated in the plan, Ma Guangyun, director of the Central District Police Bureau of the capital, and others in Nanjing and Shanghai. It is understood that this major political and military espionage case also involves some government officials, and the security authorities are currently tracking down and interrogating them. It is expected that after the entire case comes to an end, it will be publicly announced.

Six Conspiracy Steps

It is understood that the organization launched this plan after the Chinese Communist radio announced the list of 43 government war criminals on January 25. When Nanjing implemented the evacuation of public school personnel and many senior government officials left Nanjing, and Yan Huiqing, Shao Lizi, and other Shanghai Peace Delegation members flew north, they accelerated their efforts, taking six steps to try to overthrow the Nationalist government, control the capital, welcome the Communist army across the river, occupy the Nanjing-Shanghai line, and then achieve the goal of seizing political power. The six steps they set, according to the arrested, were: (1) Mobilize military police and spy agents lurking within the government to occupy Nanjing airport, railway stations, wharves, communication equipment, and bridges on the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou national highway; (2) Imprison important party, government, and military leaders below Acting President Li in Nanjing, control all important organs, and cut off all contact between the capital and the outside world; (3) Divide local forces, creating a state of anarchy in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou; (4) Gather underground elements against the government to welcome the Communist army across the river, first occupying the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou line; (5) Disrupt the rear order, create a state of terror, divide and occupy various places; (6) Cause all parties to lose contact, take the opportunity to issue false orders, and achieve the ultimate goal of seizing the entire regime. After the government cracked this major conspiracy, firstly because the people of the whole country eagerly hope for peace and fear that the announcement will affect the future of peace talks, and secondly because the spies involved in this case were too widespread, in order to avoid criminals escaping, the initial strict ban on leaks was imposed. It is said that in addition to the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee and other anti-government elements, those who instigated this conspiracy also included a few senior officials lurking in public opinion organs and within the government.

The security agencies of the capital and Shanghai jointly cracked this shocking riot conspiracy, and the process was quite tortuous and laborious, like a detective novel. From a subtle clue, through meticulous deployment, counter-espionage personnel were dispatched to penetrate the core organization of the other side, detect the entire plan, and then launch a swift arrest operation, detaining the instigators and participants one by one. As for the exact number of people arrested, the official side has so far remained silent, but foreign rumors say that it has reached more than 10 or 20 people.

The First Person Arrested

The government's arrest work began roughly on February 12 or 13. By the 17th, well-informed people in the capital had already spread the main points of the case. On the 18th, the United Press Nanjing telegram first published an interview with Qin Xiuqing, a female National Assembly representative from Songjiang Province, Northeast China, who told the agency's reporter that after her husband, Meng Shiheng, was arrested in Shanghai, she herself was placed under house arrest by government agents in her residence in Nanjing on February 14. Although she cannot be held responsible for her husband's political activities, she has lost her freedom and is under house arrest. According to the United Press reporter, three friends of Qin Xiuqing visited the residence and were all arrested. One of them was a National Assembly representative. The agency also said that when the agency's reporter visited Qin Xiuqing's residence, a plainclothes officer was on the scene, who confirmed that he was ordered to be here to rescue Qin Anshi. The monitor was also listening quietly when the reporter talked with Qin. It is said that Qin has secretly sent out a letter, which was addressed to Acting President Li, stating her situation. Qin Xiuqing also said that her husband, Meng Tuheng, had been escorted from Shanghai to Nanjing after being arrested and was still being detained. (The following text continues to the second page)

Editorial

### Starting from Mr. Anonymous's Support for Education

Our newspaper's 38th-year spring reader scholarship fund aims for 5 million yuan. After fundraising for many days, only a little less than one-third has been collected. This is certainly due to our lack of effort, but also due to the turbulent times and people's unease. We were preparing to allocate the funds according to the amount raised when, unexpectedly, a reader, Mr. "Anonymous," generously donated 1 million yuan, bringing the total to half of the targeted amount. Subsequently, he personally raised another 2.5 million yuan, completing the targeted amount for this year's reader scholarship fund. Furthermore, it was reported that the News Daily recently held the "Red Gaole" scholarship fund on behalf of Yuhua Tobacco Company. When the list of recipients was announced, the number of accepted applicants was less than the number of applicants. Mr. Anonymous also donated 2 million yuan, allowing more than 800 impoverished students to have the opportunity to continue their studies. Such enthusiasm for supporting education and benefiting impoverished students is commendable, especially the spirit of doing good without seeking recognition, which is rare in today's Shanghai and deserves the respect of the community.

Although Shanghai is known as the economic center of the country, in the past three years, it has been affected by the war, with capital from all over the country converging on the city. On the other hand, due to malignant inflation, an abnormal development has occurred, with the poor becoming poorer and the rich becoming richer, concentrating wealth in the hands of a few. However, most of these few people have a chaotic mindset, indulging in personal enjoyment, seeking only self-interest at the expense of others, and even refusing to pluck a hair to benefit the world. We only need to look at the various social relief donations in recent years, such as special relief donations, winter relief funds, and the recent aerial fundraising scholarships, and the results of the fundraising have mostly failed to reach the intended target. In this kind of deteriorating and decadent social atmosphere, Mr. Anonymous has been able to repeatedly support scholarship donations, which is even more commendable. Our newspaper calls him the "Scholarship Elder," which he truly deserves.

It is said that this Mr. "Anonymous" also used the name "Bitter Qi Master" to regularly donate to support education during the War of Resistance. According to his own statement: "I deeply sympathize with the experience of losing the opportunity to study in my youth. I have established many free schools in Shanghai, Ningbo, and other places to widely accept tuition-free students, but I always feel that there is not enough porridge for everyone, which is difficult to fulfill my wishes, so I can only do my best to do it." This means that his motivation for promoting education and supporting students is due to a deep sense of the pain of losing the opportunity to study. Therefore, he extends his own experience to others, so that impoverished students can study with peace of mind. He is not doing it for fame or gain, nor does it have that effect; he is purely based on the mentality of feeling hungry when others are hungry and feeling drowned when others are drowned, and a broad sympathy for young people who have lost the opportunity to study.

Originally, compassion is the opposite of selfishness and is the source of human creativity for society. The "benevolence" advocated by Confucius and Mencius, the "universal love" advocated by Mozi, the "agape" promoted by Christ, and the "great compassion" expounded by Buddha all take the sympathy for human beings and even for all living beings as the starting point, expand it, and establish lofty beliefs. They and their followers, for the sake of practicing this belief, sacrificed their own possessions to help others, or sacrificed their lives for righteousness. They did not hesitate to wear out their heads or grind down their heels, and they would be willing to be smashed to pieces. Ancient sages and virtuous people had this spirit, religious believers had this spirit, and revolutionary and anti-Japanese martyrs also had this spirit. However, what is lacking in today's society, especially in the extravagant and intoxicated Shanghai, is precisely this spirit of self-sacrifice and self-denial for the benefit of others!

Morality often does not have fixed standards due to differences in time and space. However, there is a common basic principle that is consistent throughout ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad: it is giving, not taking; it is giving, not possessing; it is helping others, not enriching oneself. Only in this way can one obtain peace and light in one's heart. The so-called "doing good is the greatest joy," the so-called "helping others is the foundation of happiness," and the so-called "giving alms without dwelling on appearances brings immeasurable merit" are explanations of this basic principle. John Stuart Mill also said: "Those who seek happiness must place their hearts on some object outside their own happiness, that is, on the cause of the improvement of mankind." So, simply put, if people want to gain happiness, they must sacrifice their own private happiness, promote the public happiness of the masses, and even increase the common happiness of all sentient beings in the ten directions, and then can they have true happiness.

But looking back at our society, wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few people, forming the so-called "nouveau riche" peculiar to chaotic times. They use speculative and cunning methods to deprive most common people of their livelihoods. When people are hungry and cold, they are well-fed and well-clothed; when people are busy saving lives, they indulge in pleasure. Not only do they lack a social concept and national consciousness, but they also lose even basic sympathy for humanity, let alone for all sentient beings? Mr. Anonymous is alert but unwilling to take credit for it. After our extensive inquiries, he is just a businessman. Just because he suffered the pain of losing the opportunity to study in his childhood, he can see the pain of others who have lost the opportunity to study. Therefore, he wholeheartedly helps young people who have lost the opportunity to study. Furthermore, as for those who are poor and have no one to turn to, as long as he knows about it and is able to help, he is happy to help. We think about the wealthy and powerful people of today, who have all directly or indirectly received support from the government or help from society in the past, and have even enjoyed special favors from the state. It can be said that the reason why they have their current status is that the country and the people gave them the opportunity. However, at this moment, the lives of the masses are in such suffering, and the fate of the country is facing unprecedented dangers, but we have not heard them show any compassion, nor have we seen them show any willingness to contribute their wealth. Comparing them to Mr. Anonymous, asking themselves in the quiet of the night, how can they not be ashamed to die!

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] According to information obtained here, Communist troops are gathering near Yangzhou. In addition to the original 3,000 local Communist troops, about 30,000 people have arrived in the Xiannvmiao and Yiling areas of Yangzhou in recent days. More than 30,000 of their follow-up troops are continuing to move south from Huaiyin via Gaoyou and Baoying by land and water. As for their designations, according to investigations, they are Chen Yi's 10th, 11th, and 12th columns. Furthermore, the Communist troops between Tianchang and Yangzhou are also busy moving. The 239th, Bohai Quick, and other five columns originally stationed in the Tianchang and southwest areas of Gaoyou Lake are Chen Yi's troops.

[Our Newspaper, Pukou, 28th Dispatch] The Communist troops on the southern section of the Jinpu Front, including Chen Yi's 1st, 4th, New 8th, and Liangguang columns, are still gathering in the Mingguang and Chuxian areas. However, the Liangguang column is also gradually moving south to Wuyi and Jieshou. According to a certain authoritative military observer, after the Qinglongji battle ended on January 10, Chen Yi's troops have been fully replenished in the past 50 days. At this time, the main force will move south along the three lines of the railway, canal, and highway, possibly launching an attack on the Nationalist army's bridgehead positions north of the Yangtze River, in order to sweep all areas north of the Yangtze River, create a favorable situation, and put pressure on the government to make concessions, so as to gain a more favorable position in the peace talks. However, the observer repeatedly solemnly told reporters that although the Communist troops have completed their replenishment, their preparations for crossing the Yangtze River have not yet been completed. Therefore, although they can launch an offensive against the Nationalist army's bridgehead positions north of the Yangtze River at present, it is too early to talk about crossing the river.

[Our Newspaper, Pukou, 28th Dispatch] A unit of more than 500 local Communist Lianghuai Independent Brigade harassed the Nationalist army positions in the Dongxi Ge area from Wuyi on the night of the 27th and were repelled before dawn. Another unit of more than 100 people attacked Getangji, more than 20 miles northeast of Pukou from Liuhe, and were also repelled.

### Rumors About the Deployment of Feng Zhi'an and Liu Ruming's Troops to Qingdao Are Inaccurate

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Since Feng Zhi'an was appointed as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison, there are seven Deputy Commanders-in-Chief in his department, including Li Yannian, Liu Ruming, Wan Jianfan, Shen Shaozhou, Chen Daqing, and Ding Zhipan. The headquarters is still stationed in Nanjing. As for Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo, he frequently travels between Beijing, Zhenjiang, Shanghai, and Hangzhou due to business needs. During Tang's absence from Beijing, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Wan will act on his behalf. The rumor that Feng Zhi'an and Liu Ruming's troops have been deployed to Qingdao is inconsistent with the facts.

### Eastern Gansu is Very Stable; Ma Jiyuan Will Return to His Defense Area Within Days

[Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 28th Dispatch] Ma Jiyuan, Commander of the Eastern Gansu Corps, arrived in Lanzhou from Xining on the evening of the 27th and will return to his defense area within days. According to him, everything is as usual in Qinghai. However, this year's conscription was completed entirely within a week, with more than 2,000 people voluntarily joining the volunteer army, showing the people's awareness of protecting their homeland and stabilizing the rear. He then expressed his opinion on the future of the Northwest, saying: "Today is the best opportunity for the Northwest to become self-reliant and seek progress. If we can seize this good opportunity, the future of the Northwest will be infinitely bright, otherwise, it is unpredictable." Finally, he said: "Eastern Gansu has been stable recently, and the self-defense forces are becoming more and more substantial."

### Another Change in Yongshun, Hunan; The Provincial Government is Applying Both Suppression and Appeasement

[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 28th Dispatch] Cao Zengya, an adjunct to the Yongshun Self-Defense Corps, coerced his troops to rebel. Later, Cao returned to the city after persuasion from all sides. The incident could have come to an end, but the situation has recently changed again. The rebels have raised the banner of the "Hunan-West People's Anti-Oppression Army" and organized the "Hunan-West People's Anti-Oppression Action Committee." The main reason for Cao's rebellion was that Li Mo'an, director of the 17th Pacification District, sent personnel to Yongshun to reorganize the self-defense corps, which aroused the rebels. Therefore, the rebels posted many slogans such as "Down with Li Mo'an, who oppresses the people of western Hunan." Nie Pengsheng, the special commissioner of the 8th District, is also under Cao's "troop protection." It is reported that a part of the rebels, about 2,000 people with guns, has fled to Wusu in the upper reaches of Yuanling to cause trouble. There are also traces of rebels in Chachuan between Taoyuan and Yuanling. In addition to sending troops to block and suppress the rebels, the provincial government is still doing its best to adopt a policy of appeasement.

### In Chaotic Times, One Must Abide by One's Duties

Ding Zhipan Encourages the Provincial Government of Jiangsu

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 28th Dispatch] The Jiangsu Provincial Government held a weekly meeting on the morning of the 28th, attended by more than 500 heads of agencies and staff. Chairman Ding delivered a speech on the theme of "Abiding by One's Duties in Chaotic Times."

### The Communist Side in Peiping Forbids Foreign Reporters From Operating; The U.S. State Department Discusses Countermeasures; The Communist Party's Attitude Toward Foreigners Gradually Becomes Clear, According to the United Press

[United Press, Washington, 27th Dispatch] State Department spokesman McGruder said on the 27th that the State Department is studying the Chinese Communist Party's action of prohibiting all foreign reporters from filing and reporting news from Beiping. He said that the order also prohibits the U.S. Information Service in Beiping from issuing news releases. The activity has been suspended pending possible policy changes from China. U.S. Consul General in Beiping Clubb told the State Department that he had received a mimeographed notice signed by the chairman and vice chairman of the Beiping Military Control Commission ordering the prohibition of the release of news. Clubb said that he knew the same formal notice had been sent to foreign reporters stationed in Beiping.

[United News Agency, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] The U.S. Embassy here confirmed today that the U.S. Information Service in Beiping had been ordered by the local Communist authorities to stop issuing news releases, but an embassy spokesman declined to comment.

[United Press, Our City Dispatch] What the Communist Party will do with foreigners in general, especially foreign enterprises, in its occupied areas, is incomprehensible to the general public. Now at least these two questions have been answered. The Communist Party's action in Beiping to prohibit foreign reporters from sending telegrams may or may not be a temporary measure from military control to political control. The Communist Party did not state this in its official announcement. The second point is the reply to the Mutual Economic Cooperation Agency's protest against the seizure of flour in the Beiping warehouse. On February 19, the Mutual Economic Cooperation Agency announced that the director of the Mutual Economic Cooperation Agency's Beiping branch, Davis, had formally protested to the Beiping Military Control Commission against "the illegal removal of some bags of flour from the Mutual Economic Cooperation Agency." On the night of the 27th, the Communist Party radio station replied that this was no longer the affair of the Mutual Economic Cooperation Agency, because these 6,666 bags of flour had already belonged to the Kuomintang when the Military Control Commission took over. These flours have been included in the list of property handed over to the Beiping Military Control Commission by the director of the Kuomintang's "U.S. Aid Association" in Beiping. Therefore, the receipt of these flours has nothing to do with the Chinese branch of the Mutual Economic Cooperation Agency.

### On the Closure of the Peiping World Daily, Cheng Shewo Issues a Statement, Saying That It Can Strengthen His Belief in Fighting for Freedom of the Press

[Our City Dispatch] Cheng Shewo, president of the Peiping World Daily, recently issued a statement on the closure of the newspaper by the Peiping Communist Military Control Commission, as follows:

"From the broadcast in northern Shaanxi, I learned that the Peiping World Daily, which I painstakingly founded and has a long history in North China, was closed by the Peiping Communist Military Control Commission on the 25th of this month. I left Peiping at the end of September last year. In December, the Communist army suddenly attacked Tianjin and Peiping, and transportation was cut off. After the Communist army entered Peiping, my colleagues in Peiping could not voluntarily stop publishing due to safety reasons. Since January, the order in Peiping has gradually stabilized, and the Communist army has controlled the overall situation. There is no longer a need to forcibly "pretend to be progressive" for the original newspapers. Therefore, dozens of newspapers in the city were closed one by one. However, the Peiping World Daily was uniquely extended to the very end. Therefore, I should not express resentment or anger towards the Communist Party's closure of the Peiping World Daily. I can only blame it for being too good. Especially in the closure of all private newspapers, the World Daily was uniquely singled out and given a lengthy broadcast stating the reasons. Such importance given to the World Daily makes me feel overwhelmed.

Facts Cannot Be Distorted

Since the World Daily was founded in 1924, it has been persecuted under almost every dynasty. The so-called closures have occurred no less than dozens of times, and my personal arrests and imprisonment are also equal in number. When Peiping fell in 1937, the newspaper was plundered by the Japanese invaders. When it resumed publication after the victory, in the resumption declaration that I signed, I painfully told both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party that if the Communist Party did not change its policies and still specialized in killing, arson, fighting, and riots as the government said, the government's use of force would be unstoppable; if the Kuomintang could not deeply realize and thoroughly reform, and still followed the old ways, procrastinated, and was corrupt and decadent, the people's revolution would be inevitable. Since the victory, every proposition of the World Daily has been based on this principle. Even today, I have not found any reason to feel remorse under the guns and bayonets of any dynasty. If the Communist Party recognizes this as "a non-partisan mask," then I would rather wear this mask for the rest of my life. Fortunately, the past comments of the World Daily, word by word, are fair and kind. The broad masses of North China have long established their opinions, and there is no need for my辩证, nor can anyone distort them. More than 20 years ago, I was just a scholar who founded this newspaper with only a few hundred dollars. Until today, when it was closed by the Communist Party, it has been able to have a large scale and a large readership among the private newspapers in North China. The reason is obvious to everyone. However, the World Daily has never accepted any support from any dynasty, nor has it had any relationship with them. Even the low-interest cultural loans that were available in various places under the rule of the Kuomintang government were also rejected. In the assets of the World Daily closed by the Communist Party, every gear of every machine, every character of every stereotype, was obtained by me and hundreds of colleagues rack their brains and shed blood and sweat. Although the World Daily cannot temporarily provide超然 independent comments and prompt and reliable news to the broad masses of North China, the encouragement given to the World Daily for its growth and nourishment by the broad masses of readers in North China in the past few decades can strengthen my belief and the beliefs of countless news warriors in continuing to fight hard for freedom of the press. Recalling the War of Resistance, not only was my Peiping World Daily destroyed by the enemy, but all the other newspapers that I ran in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong were also plundered one after another. Hankou and Guilin fell before they could be published. I finally resumed publication of the World Daily in Chongqing on the eve of victory. I deeply believe that the world is so big that the Communist Party can close my Peiping World Daily, but it cannot close my will to devote my life to the news business and promote justice and resist violence.

Slander Does Not Need to Be 正

As for the Communist Party's broadcast accusing me of being a CC member of the Kuomintang, this kind of malicious rumor does not need me to defend it. If the broadcaster does not destroy his own amazing achievements in intelligence work, a little thought about the current situation of various factions and the ironclad fact that I never participated in any faction will make him laugh. Fortunately, every dynasty has the innate privilege of manufacturing titles and slandering dissidents. "National Special Agents" and "Bandit Spies" are the same in different places. This is an unchanging law throughout ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, and it is especially true today. I can only lament the increasing decline of political morality."

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 28th] The market price of Hong Kong dollars has been stable recently, hovering around 410.

### Terrifying Conspiracy of Riots - Continued from Page 1

The Night of Rue de Courbet This United Press report has aroused widespread attention. According to relevant sources, the person in charge of the special operations in five provinces and three cities was Xu Zhiyuan. The confession implicated as many as 70 to 80 people, including some government officials. Xu, a native of Sixian, Anhui, graduated from the sixth class of the Central Military Academy. He served as deputy editor of the Nanjing China Daily and magistrate of Sixian, Anhui. Last year, he was introduced to the Supervisory Committee of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Region as an investigation specialist and had close ties with Meng Shiheng. Later, the authorities also discovered that the head of the women's department of the special operations organization was Xia Bengying. Xia, a native of Anhui, was a female National Assembly representative and graduated from Chaoyang University in Beiping. She was quite active in the Party and Youth League in her early years. Her appointment as a National Assembly representative was generated by a national women's organization. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, she cohabited with Zhu Yunshan, a member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, for some time. After the victory, Zhu went to work in the "Liberated Area." It is said that he has recently taken office as the Secretary-General of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang under Li Jishen. When the Communist Party's radio station announced the declaration of 55 democratic figures on the current situation in late January, Zhu Yunshan was also listed. Xia came to Shanghai during the evacuation of public education personnel. She was arrested on February 15, after the curfew, at Xu's residence on Rue de Courbet in Hongkou. National Assembly representatives from Anhui who stayed in Shanghai, unaware of the truth, visited the local security authorities to inquire about the reasons for the arrest, but were unable to obtain any information at that time.

In addition, Ma Guangyun, the director of the Central District Police Department of the capital, was arrested in Nanjing. It is said that Ma participated in the riots and attempted to use force to capture Huang Zhenwu, the director of the Capital Police Department, and then control the capital. The current director of the Central District Police Department has been replaced by Ouyang Jing, the deputy superintendent of the Capital Police Department. (Ma had fabricated a news story that Director Huang had absconded and was detained at the airport, which was given to Zhao Lingyun, a female reporter from the Nanjing Renbao, through the bureau's police inspector. The newspaper, unaware, published a report on January 31, "Director Huang Flees and Fails, Arrested by Subordinates at the Airport." Ma's purpose was to use the newspaper to damage Director Huang's reputation, so that the police officers would become dissatisfied with Huang and expand into petitions, and even strikes, to cooperate with this conspiracy. Later, the police inspector was also arrested.) It is said that there are also a few military police personnel currently responsible for maintaining public order among those arrested. Therefore, the plan on how to capture Acting President Li in this major conspiracy can be said to be not only detailed, but also easy to implement. The initial intention was to wait until the first step was completed, and then proceed step by step according to the above plan.

Continued Investigation Another source claims that a certain government agency learned around January that anti-government elements were plotting riots. However, the materials obtained were mostly fragmented and incomplete. Later, a certain capable intelligence officer in the government used all kinds of methods to infiltrate this special operations organization and took on counter-espionage work before gradually obtaining clues. This conspiracy was orchestrated by Meng Shiheng, who was hiding in Shanghai. Therefore, after painstaking efforts, it was discovered that a certain honest elder was a close friend of Meng. A certain security agency in Nanjing asked the elder to act as an introducer, introducing someone as Acting President Li's representative to negotiate peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party with Meng Shiheng. Before and up to the present, the elder did not know that Meng had joined this special operations organization and was engaged in a riot to subvert the government, nor did he know that the representative of Acting President Li was actually a disguised figure sent by the government's security agency as a counter-spy. Initially, the elder was invited to a certain security agency in Nanjing. After the agency informed him of the purpose of the summons, the elder said that whether Meng Shiheng was in Nanjing or not had to be investigated before he could know the truth. At this time, the security agency already knew that Meng had left Nanjing and came to Shanghai, but the only difficulty was that they did not know his Shanghai residence. However, in order to prevent the elder from suspecting anything else, they agreed to let him investigate before making a decision. The next day, the elder replied, saying that Meng had gone to Shanghai. The security agency asked him to write a letter or use a long-distance call to introduce Acting President Li's representative to Meng for a brief discussion. The elder believed that the matter concerned peace talks and was of great importance. It seemed difficult to succeed unless he went in person, so he decided to accompany Acting President Li's representative to Shanghai himself. After arriving in Shanghai, the elder and Acting President Li's representative agreed that he would first go to Meng's residence to obtain Meng Shiheng's consent to the principles of peace talks before acting as an introducer. In fact, when the elder went to Meng's place, the security agency of the capital, with the assistance of the security personnel of this city, had already secretly sent people to follow the elder. When the elder finished talking with Meng and went out, the security personnel of a certain security agency in this city arrested Meng. When the elder returned to the hotel and told Acting President Li's representative that Meng was willing to meet him, the news of Meng's arrest also arrived at the same time. The elder did not understand why, and on the way back to Nanjing, he repeatedly begged Acting President Li's representative to ask Acting President Li to order the Shanghai security agency to release him. As a result of Meng Shiheng's arrest, the conspiracy of this major riot and all its plans were fully known, and Meng's superior secret instructions were found. Based on this clue, three giants who were responsible for the top decision-making of the five-person group, namely organization, propaganda, and military-industrial sports, were also captured. These three main figures were arrested by the security agency after Meng Shiheng was escorted to Nanjing and confessed. They were then escorted to Nanjing by special plane and brought to justice. In addition, there have been quite a few people arrested in connection with this case in recent days, but the relevant parties declined to disclose the number, but stated that the government is unwilling to continue arresting people at this time, but for those who attempt to subvert the government through special operations, the government has no choice but to take appropriate action for self-defense.

### Southeast Asia Anti-Communist Alliance May Be Established at New Delhi Conference; Dominions Will Determine Aid Steps for Burma; Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu Calls on National People to Be Loyal to Their Country

[Our Newspaper] London, 28th Broadcast: British Dominions met in New Delhi today, ostensibly to discuss the situation in Burma, but according to relevant sources, the scope of the meeting will be expanded, and the formulation of a Southeast Asian regional defense plan will gradually take shape at this meeting. The person said that among the Dominions, India already has the strength to become an anti-communist bulwark. Australian Foreign Minister Evatt said that since Britain is currently busy dealing with European affairs, the Pacific Dominions should be led by Australia. Evatt and Australian Prime Minister Chifley both believe that because the Communist Party has succeeded in China and communists are constantly infiltrating South Pacific countries, all countries must take appropriate action immediately. Australian people believe that the only hope for Southeast Asian democratic countries today lies in maintaining good friendship with a powerful India, and they can no longer rely on the assistance of Dutch and French troops. Australian people also said that based on the experience of the last war, it can be seen that Britain is actually unable to send large armies on expeditions overseas. Chifley praised Nehru and considered him one of the six great men of the present era. It is widely believed that an organization similar to the Western European Union may be established at today's meeting to resist foreign aggression.

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 27th] Pakistan does not intend to participate in the informal meeting on the situation in Burma in New Delhi tomorrow, but intends to participate in any formal consultations in the future. It is believed that the Burmese government recently requested a loan from Britain, so it must state its diplomatic policy among the British Dominions. The purpose of the meeting is threefold: first, to plan ways to restore order in Burma and support the Thakin Nu government; second, to mediate disputes and prohibit the supply of arms or military intervention; and third, to provide economic assistance to protect the safety of Burmese rice exports. Nehru will represent India at the meeting, and Ceylon will be represented by its High Commissioner to India.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 28th] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt arrived here by plane on the night of the 27th and will represent Australia at the conference of British Dominions on the situation in Burma held here. Evatt had a long meeting with Indian Prime Minister Nehru on the morning of the 28th.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 28th] British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia MacDonald also arrived on the 27th, and British Overseas Trade Minister Bottomley, representing Britain, had arrived here a few days ago.

[Central News Agency, Yangon, 27th] The Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma led more than 10,000 Burmese people this morning to hold a loyal citizens' rally at Bandula Square.

### Nehru Attends Parliament, Criticizes Indian Communist Party Rebellion, Government Decides to Take Resolute Measures

[United Press, New Delhi, 28th] Indian Prime Minister Nehru told Parliament on the 28th that the robbery in the Calcutta area at the end of last week and the widespread destruction throughout India were Communist Party actions aimed at overthrowing the government by force. Nehru said that in the past ten days, a total of 870 communists have been arrested for riots that are "close to open rebellion." The government's resolute measures against "murderers, arsonists, and saboteurs" will continue. He continued: "The attitude taken by the Communist Party is not only openly hostile to the government, but also can be described as close to open rebellion. The Lower House is well aware of the Communist Party rebellion in neighboring countries. Some people in India are trying to incite the people to actively rebel, and this is believed to be an extension of the same policy." He also said that the robbery in Calcutta by mobs on the 26th and 27th, as well as the Communist Party's efforts to brew a national railway strike despite the resolution of the Railway Workers' Association not to strike, are actually related to the Communist Party's policies in various parts of the Far East.

### British Labour Party Policy Determined: Expanding Nationalization Plan for Basic Industries; Communist Party Attacks Government for Relying on Anti-Soviet Alliance

[London, Feb. 27th (Associated Press)] According to reliable sources tonight: The British Labour Party has decided to continue expanding its nationalization plan for basic industries, although there are exceptions for electors. Labour leaders and key cabinet members, including Prime Minister Attlee, held a secret two-day meeting at Shanklin on the Isle of Wight. The nationalization of sugar refineries and raw materials has been included in the tentative platform for the 1950 general election, and the chemical industry may also be added to the nationalization plan. The Labour Party hopes to regain the overwhelming victory of 1950.

Few details of the meeting have been released, but it is rumored that the shipbuilding industry will not be nationalized, largely due to opposition from trade unions, and flour mills will also be temporarily excluded. However, the Labour Party has reviewed twenty or thirty industries to determine which are most suitable for nationalization, and there may be some unexpected developments before 1950. The Labour government has so far nationalized overseas airlines, the Bank of England, submarine cables and wireless communications, coal mines, railways, inland navigation, and electricity industries, and the steel nationalization bill has been submitted to Parliament. Deputy Prime Minister Morrison and Health Minister Bevan, who lead the left and right wings of the cabinet, did not have divided opinions at the meeting, unlike when the nationalization of the steel industry was proposed last year.

[London, Feb. 27th (Agence France-Presse)] The British Communist Party issued a declaration today, strongly criticizing the government for relying on the North Atlantic Treaty, attempting to unite Wall Street's plutocrats, the imperialism of Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium, the fascism of Spain and Portugal, the reactionism of Turkey, and the royalism of Greece into an evil alliance to fight against the Soviet Union, the new democratic countries, the colonial people, and the working class of Europe. The Soviet Union has always prioritized peace and will never wage aggressive wars. The statement also demanded that all American troops withdraw from Britain and that Stalin, Truman, and Attlee immediately choose a location to meet and discuss troop reductions and the prohibition of atomic bombs. It then criticized the Marshall Plan and urged Britain to quickly engage in new trade negotiations with the Soviet Union. Finally, it announced that the Communist Party plans to nominate one hundred candidates in the upcoming general election to participate in the competition. It also stated that the Communist Party's domestic front would advocate for increased wages, large reductions in profits, increased taxes on the wealthy, and the construction of four hundred houses each year. It is noted that the Communist Party currently holds only two seats in the 640-seat House of Commons.

### Churchill's Autocratic Style: Conservative Party Losing Public Support

[London, Feb. 27th (Associated Press)] Some Conservative Party leaders in Britain are now discussing removing Churchill from his role as the main drafter of the party platform.

Members of Parliament in the party are extremely uneasy, believing that Churchill should have a chief of staff to develop parliamentary and election strategies. Former Foreign Secretary Eden was originally the second most important figure in the Conservative Party, but informed sources say that Churchill insists on "playing a one-man show."

### Nordic Countries Inclined Towards Western Alliance; North Atlantic Treaty a Matter of Time; Soviet Union Covets Norway's Rich Atomic Resources

[Oslo, Feb. 27th (Associated Press)] High-level diplomatic sources predicted today that the Scandinavian countries, including traditionally neutral Sweden, are likely to join the future North Atlantic Treaty within the next six months. Norway is already prepared to join, and the main political party in Denmark, the Social Democrats, has called on the government to move closer to the West for military security. Key figures in Sweden also privately acknowledge that Sweden cannot maintain its delicate balancing act between the East and West blocs for long. Isolation is becoming increasingly impossible, and the only option is to sympathize with the West. Sweden will likely join the North Atlantic Alliance before this autumn. If the Soviet Union takes any action against Finland, Sweden's participation may be accelerated even further.

[Oslo, Feb. 27th (Associated Press)] The Soviet Union's desire to isolate Norway from Western countries is quite intense, and there is a secret reason for this, namely that Norway is an atomic nation. In a secret laboratory in Norway, there is already an atomic pile that stores nuclear fission energy. Heavy water is essential for atomic research. The Norsk Hydro plant in the remote mountains of southern Norway already produces it in large quantities. Uranium mines are also being mined in central Norway, and there is more than one city equipped with atomic smashers. The Soviet counterintelligence agencies are well aware of this, and how this affects Soviet policy towards Norway now and in the future is a major question. The Soviet Union's attention to Norwegian atomic research is expressed in different ways. The Communist Party does not hide its desire to obtain this information, and Soviet Ambassador Afanasiev is prepared to welcome any incidental reports from Norwegian scientists, but so far has not gained anything. As far as outsiders know, Norwegian scientists do not want to play with atomic bombs, and their research is focused on how to make atomic energy available for peaceful purposes. Even in this area, the Soviet Union has endless curiosity.

### Landlord Collecting Rent in US Dollars: Tenant Requests Ban; First Case Deserving of Attention; Land Administration Bureau to Summon Both Parties Today

[Reported by this newspaper] There are many cases in this city where rent for houses is paid in foreign currency, gold, or rice, but the Phoenix Silk Company and more than 20 other households are the first to officially submit a written request to the Land Administration Bureau for a ban. The Phoenix Silk Company and more than 20 other households rent houses from Russian Gulin (real estate company at 129 Maoming South Road). Gulin previously demanded that each tenant's rent be increased to US$400. The tenants, unable to afford it, submitted a request to the Land Administration Bureau for a ban. The original request stated: "More than 20 households respectively rent houses on various floors at the intersection of Nanjing West Road and Gordon Road. After the currency system was reformed, the landlord Gulin actually demanded that rent be paid at US$400, which is equivalent to eight taels of pure gold or eighty dan of white rice after September of last year. This request violates the standards announced by the municipal government and approved by the municipal council, as well as Article 6 of the Provisional Measures for the Management of House Leasing in this city, which stipulates that rent cannot be calculated in foreign currency. It also does not comply with the provisions of Article 97, Paragraph 1 of the Land Law. At the moment, Gulin is illegally coercing payment of rent in US dollars and threatening eviction. The situation is urgent. We request that you immediately order both parties to be summoned and legally reduce the amount of rent to stabilize society and maintain commerce." The names listed at the end of the document include Phoenix Silk Company, Continental Music House, Best Shoes Company, Bailey Company, Dazhong Bookstore, and more than 20 other households. Shen, the director of the Land Administration Bureau, paid close attention to the submission and has ordered Secretary Qian to summon both parties at 3:00 p.m. today to inquire about the situation and make a decision. According to Secretary Qian, this is also the first case of requesting mediation of housing disputes based on Article 97 of the Land Law.

### Tangshan Ship Carrying Coal Arrives in Shanghai: Crew Members Visited Qinhuangdao City; Market is Depressed, Vegetables are Purchased by Exchanging Rice

[Reported by this newspaper] The "Guangshan" ship, the second ship transporting coal from Qinhuangdao in exchange for materials from the Communist area, arrived at the Kailuan Coal Line Wharf in Pudong at 5:30 p.m. yesterday. The ship carried 6,800 tons of fuel coal. Together with the fuel coal transported by the previous "Great Shanghai" ship, the total has reached 11,600 tons. According to the ship's captain, Jiang Baokang, the Communist authorities allowed all crew members to go ashore when the ship docked in Qinhuangdao this time. The procedure for going ashore was for him to issue a certificate, which was then verified by customs and Communist political personnel before being released. During their one and a half day stay in Qinhuangdao, although they went to the streets to stroll, they were unable to contact ordinary people. The only impression they had was that the market was depressed. When they went ashore to purchase vegetables, they exchanged them for rice. This method was also stipulated by the Communist political personnel.

### The "Greater Shanghai" Again Sails North Yesterday, Carrying a Large Quantity of Mail and Flour

According to the Coal Regulation Office, the current monthly coal demand in Shanghai is approximately 100,000 tons. In addition to the regular supply of 30,000 to 40,000 tons per month from Keelung, Taiwan, if the shipping industry can also regularly send ten ships from North China, there will be no problem with the coal supply. Furthermore, the current reserves are gradually becoming abundant, and the coal shortage can be alleviated.

### Yang Chuo'an, Accused of Grain Procurement Fraud, Questioned and Released on Bail; Minor Disturbance During Court Adjournment – Chasing a Weasel

[Report from our newspaper] Yang Chuo'an, Director of the Emergency Grain Procurement and Storage Committee of the Ministry of Food, and Di Zhaolin, Head of the Industrial Management Group, were impeached by the Control Yuan for grain procurement fraud during their tenure at the Northeast Materials Regulation Committee. The Presidential Office handed the case over to the Supreme Court Procuratorate, which in turn ordered the Shanghai District Procuratorate to investigate. Yesterday, at 8:00 AM, Prosecutor Shen Jiping of the Procuratorate held the initial court hearing. Both defendants arrived on time to answer questions. The case file was large, taking time to review. Finally, the court concluded that the case required further investigation. Both defendants were ordered to provide a substantial store guarantee and were dismissed from the court at 5:30 PM. The prosecutor handling the case refused to disclose the contents of the Control Yuan's impeachment. As the two defendants were leaving the court in the evening, a sharp-snouted weasel, over a foot long, scurried across the drain at the gate of the District Procuratorate. A court police officer spotted it and shouted, "Catch the weasel!" At that moment, court police officers, laborers, and others in the courtyard rushed to capture it. After several attempts, the weasel finally escaped quickly.

### Young Woman Rescued After Attempting Suicide in River After Being Claimed by Her Husband; Reconciliation Between Husband and Wife

[Report from our newspaper] A young woman, Zhou Linjun, left home on the 23rd of this month after arguing with her husband, Yang Dingxi. In a moment of grief and anger, she went to Dongjiadu the next morning to attempt suicide in the Huangpu River. Fortunately, she was discovered and rescued by a passerby, who escorted her to the Penglai Police Station. However, after interrogation by the police station, she refused to disclose her name and address. As a last resort, the station transferred her to the Security Section of the General Bureau. Just as they were about to transfer her to a women's shelter, her husband learned of what happened and rushed to the General Bureau to claim her. The couple reunited, bursting into tears. Yang was extremely worried after his wife left home. After searching for several days without any news, he went to the responsible police station yesterday to report and request an investigation. Only then did he learn that five days ago, the Penglai Branch had rescued a woman with similar clothing to his wife who had attempted suicide in the river. He immediately went to the branch, but learned that she had already been transferred to the General Bureau. He then went to the Security Section of the General Bureau, where the department was processing the official documents to transfer his wife to a women's shelter. The department director witnessed the scene and was very moved. After consulting with Director Yu and offering comfort, he approved the release of his wife to her husband. Yang presented a claim slip when claiming his wife, which read, "Yang Dingxi, the undersigned, hereby claims his wife, Zhou Linjun. Presented to the Security Section of the Shanghai Police Bureau."

### A Student Who Came South After the Fall Arrives in Shanghai, Discussing Travel Frustrations; Three Sleepless Nights Without Food Passing Through Dezhou

[Report from our newspaper] The reporter recently encountered a sixth-year student from the Medical College of National Peking University at the train station. He claimed to have come south two weeks after the "liberation" of Peking, experiencing many difficulties along the way, and only arriving in Shanghai last night. Because most of his family members are still residing in Peking, he asked the reporter not to publish his real name to ensure their safety. However, he told the reporter with a resolute and sincere tone that his motivation for leaving Peking was his unwillingness to lose his original freedom, so he risked his life and ventured south. He will graduate this summer. Before Peking fell, he was still interning at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Peking University. He claimed that he has no knowledge of politics and is not interested in it, so he initially remained indifferent amidst the cheers of his classmates celebrating "liberation." Later, a series of naturally occurring events gradually disappointed him, and he developed the idea of going south. On the evening of the 12th of this month, he heard a broadcast from Nanjing on the shortwave radio, which was strictly prohibited by the Chinese Communist Party, knowing that ships had begun to come north from Shanghai. His first step was to plan to find a way to go to Qinhuangdao first. Because the Chinese Communist Party requires people to apply for a "road pass" to leave the customs or go south, he went to the Public Security Bureau and the district office, claiming that he was visiting his sick father in his Shandong hometown, reporting his departure route and the number of luggage items, and applying for the pass. However, they suspected that he was taking a sea route, so they delayed and procrastinated, and after several days of running around, he achieved nothing. He then made another plan to go to Tianjin to find a way, but he felt that the Chinese Communist Party's administrative control methods were not uniform, and it became even more difficult after arriving in Tianjin. He had no choice but to return to the ancient city. That night, he confided in a professor at Peking University, asking him why he, as an old Kuomintang member, did not consider leaving Peking. The professor pondered for a long time, repeatedly stating that he had to stay to protect the school.

Took a Train to Dezhou from Peking Based on the Pass

At this time, he had another friend who also planned to return south with him at the same time, so he once again tried to arrange a "road pass". On the 20th, he met a female duty officer in the Public Security Sub-bureau, and after inquiring about the situation, she said, "You are a doctor and have served the people, so you can be allowed to leave." But she pointed to his friend and said, "You are a graduate of the Central Military Academy and cannot leave for the time being." At this point, he decided to take the "road pass" to leave Peking alone. However, after arriving in Dezhou, he found that his friend had followed him. Before they could talk in detail, they hurriedly negotiated "changing trains". Dezhou is now a transit station for the two administrative regions of the Chinese Communist Party. Precisely because of this, after strict inspections, they were deemed to have insufficient documents and were not allowed to board the train. Because he was eager to go south, he handed over his luggage to his friend that night and bid him farewell, saying, "I have decided to find a way to sneak into the station. If anything happens, take care of yourself."

Workers in the Station Helped; Hidden in Coal Cars to Exit

At that time, there was a worker in the station whose family had been treated by him at the Third Hospital of Peking University. After unintentionally meeting him, he learned of the situation and promised to act as an escort to repay his kindness. After 8:00 PM, several coal cars were driven out of the siding for loading. The worker hid him in a coal car, and as a result, he was able to leave the country. After that, he tried to find a way along the way, changing routes several times, and arrived in Shanghai yesterday after three sleepless nights. According to him, the university is brewing reforms, and the length of study may be shortened, and the faculties of arts and law will be merged. Each teacher in the universities receives a monthly salary of 1,500 people's tickets, plus 60 pounds of millet and a bag of flour. Each staff member receives a monthly salary of 1,000 people's tickets, plus 60 pounds of miscellaneous grains. Each worker receives a monthly salary of 750 people's tickets. The income is not much different from before, and the status of workers has not been raised as rumored. The Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to cultural and educational undertakings. The Peking Military Control Commission has a "Cultural and Education Group" to lead all cultural and educational activities. Several grand celebrations of "liberation" in the ancient city were all "led" by the group. All newspapers in Peking use Xinhua News Agency reports. Land policy, urban work policy, and new democracy have become the center of revising the original curriculum of the schools. Almost all of the deans of students in the universities have been replaced.

### Are You Lin Biao's Troops? …New Observations from Beiping After Local Peace…

— Andrew Roth

[Beiping Dispatch] When this reporter boarded the last plane to the Beiping line before the Communists took over, an old friend said to me, "You've come at just the right time, you can write another 'Ten Days That Shook the World'!"  'Ten Days That Shook the World' is a magnificent book by John Reed depicting the Bolsheviks seizing power in November 1917.

For months, the Communist Party has been winning victories in China. It not only has the potential to shake the world, but also to change the balance of the world, encouraging Stalin to launch a peace offensive in order to win equal peace.

It wasn't until January 31st that the Communist army entered Beiping, without any prior notice or preparations.

Marching All Day

On February 3rd, troops marched on the main roads of the city all day long, reportedly departing from the Pingjin area to the southern battlefields. In the Communist army ranks passing through Beiping city, there were hundreds of newly captured American trucks, dragging many Japanese-style artillery pieces and six-inch mountain guns. Of course, the Red Army also had Soviet trucks, but they did not participate in this marching procession.

What was most touching about this march was not the material aspects, but the people. The clothing of the Communist soldiers, apart from wearing leather hats, was also light yellow military uniforms, almost no different from the Nationalists, and both were conscripted peasants. The Nationalist soldiers made you feel so..., but the Communist soldiers looked so energetic. This is naturally the result of their usual ideological training under the name of the "People's Liberation Army." At the time, two students asked several Communist soldiers, "Are you Lin Biao's troops?" They replied, "No, we are the people's army." From the above incident, we can also discover the Communist army's sense of self-esteem.

Automatic and Passive

The people of Beiping, some voluntarily, some passively, came out to welcome the Communist army entering the city. The only group that seemed to be enthusiastic were the students. In the streets, you could often see students dressed up, singing, and performing Yangge dances. Although all of this is a manifestation of young people's enthusiasm, the Beiping student movement has always represented a part of national consciousness. In the nationalist movements of 1919 and 1925, and the anti-Japanese movement of 1936, the Beiping student movement had a real presence.

Other residents of Beiping were less enthusiastic about the march. Beiping is China's most famous ancient cultural city, and the Chinese people who have gone through long-term suffering have become suspicious and nosy. They believe that the government is a permanent evil. Their attitude towards the government does not depend on what the government is called or what plans it has, but on whether that government can let them live.

A liberal foreigner returned home and excitedly said to his cook, "The Communist Party has come!" But the cook calmly replied, "Prices are still so high."

Prices in Beiping are falling, because Beiping is now connected to the interior, the supply of water and electricity has improved, and trams have also resumed operation. The 8 o'clock curfew has been lifted. Many people in Beiping have been touched by the Communist army's exemplary actions.

The takeover work is proceeding smoothly. The Kuomintang's North China Daily has now been renamed the People's Daily, run by the Communist Party. This newspaper is edited by a famous Chinese journalist. Many newspapers in Beiping, except for one, have replaced the previous Kuomintang Central News Agency news with the Communist Party's Xinhua News Agency news.

Lack of Talent

An easily unnoticed fact is the lack of talent (which is due to the Communist Party's military victory exceeding its political ability). Therefore, whenever they take over an institution, they only take over the duties of the superiors, and the remaining lower-level personnel are not changed. For example, the Beiping Police Bureau, apart from replacing six Kuomintang officials with Communist Party members, has not changed otherwise. The current Director of the Beiping Police Bureau is General Tan Zhen, wearing a cotton uniform that is too wide and large, and with his sleeves rolled up.

"We have very little experience in managing a city," the director reported to his subordinates. "All we know is how to govern a village. We will learn from you, but you must also learn from us." The first thing he told the police was: The poor people have now stood up.

The Communist Party seems to be very enthusiastic about supporting the poor. The first major event the Communist Party did after taking over Beiping was the Labor Congress on February 7th. On the congress stage, there were Communist Party flags and portraits of Mao Zedong and Zhu De. More than 20,000 workers came from inside and outside the city that day, including the worker delegation from the Mentougou coal mine. The gray-faced laborers were honorably embraced and sat on the stage, and the speakers began to tell them that they now had a "People's Government," and they must work hard and oppose the offensive of the "American-peddled peace brokers."

Printing Money

The Communist Party has been completely successful in encouraging workers to repair railways and do other work through various means. This is because its hard work and leadership have set a good example, and not just relying on propaganda. In the first few days of the Communist army entering Beiping, the Communist Party's currency system administrator had a 20-minute conversation with the person in charge of the former government's Beiping branch of the Central Printing Factory. The result of this conversation was to stop the printing of the rapidly devaluing Gold Yuan Certificates and instead print "People's Currency." It is said that the Communist Party officials participating in the "People's Currency" printing work worked day and night, sleeping only a few hours each day on the floor next to his desk.

Self-Reflection

Within the Chinese Communist Party, discipline is very strict. General Ye Jianying, the current Mayor of Beiping, also only wears a worn-out blue cloth cotton uniform without medals. All daily necessities of the Communist soldiers are completely supplied by the military, and they are not allowed to buy anything themselves. When someone asked the Communist Party's political workers how they spend their evenings, the answer was a very stern few words: "Self-reflection."

The Communist Party members all have a secure vigilance, that is, unless permitted by the military, it is forbidden to take any photos except for those they publish. It is not easy for anyone to get photos of their army. The Nanjing peace delegation was allowed to fly to Beiping, but when the plane circled over Beiping, it was immediately attacked by the Communist army's anti-aircraft artillery. Chinese journalists who came with the peace delegation were also prevented from leaving the airport by the Communist Party.

However, excessive strictness almost completely isolated the city's aviation from the Kuomintang-controlled areas. This is because the Communist Party is afraid that airplanes will become tools for military and political espionage. The same fear is the fear that secret radio and telegraph communication with Tianjin and other Communist Party-occupied areas will be broken. In Beiping, if necessary, it is still possible to make wireless calls to friends in Shanghai and Nanjing.

The only difficult problem now facing the new government in Beiping is dealing with foreigners and foreign relations. There are about 2,000 foreigners in Beiping, including many foreign envoys, because Beiping was once the capital of China.

Although the Chinese Communist Party now rules over 400 million people, it has not been officially recognized by any foreign country. Therefore, their feelings towards foreigners are not very good. Like in Tianjin, some foreign envoys, including the Soviet envoy, wanted to visit the newly appointed mayor of Tianjin, but were rejected. The answer received was: "Because you do not recognize us, we are also not very willing to recognize you." This point is the Communist Party's lack of diplomatic experience, because in international law, diplomatic recognition is irrelevant to the status of envoys.

Communist Party members are also suspicious of foreigners who have lived in the interior for a long time, because they believe that in today's world, the anti-Communist world is actively opposing them, and the Communist world is only passively approving of them. Foreigners are not prevented from traveling between Beiping and other Communist areas, and they can obtain a travel permit to travel. But in Beiping, no travel permits have been issued to foreigners yet. It is conceivable that there is a shortage of necessary machinery in the Communist areas. The main reason for the shortage is the unwillingness of foreign ships to come to Tianjin and trade with the Communist areas. Similarly, it is very difficult for foreign journalists to obtain official information, because low-level Communist Party officials are also unwilling to talk to foreign journalists.

Closure and Confiscation

Among many foreign countries, the Communist Party hates the United States the most, just like the nationalists. They resent the United States for helping the "reactionary regime" to interfere in China's internal affairs. They believe that the United States is the driving force behind anti-communism. They regard American consuls as enemy members within Chinese territory. They regard American journalists as highly likely spies. According to reports, the radio station of the American consulate in Shenyang has not only been closed like the radio stations of other countries' consulates, but has been further confiscated.

At the same time, Communist Party members feel difficult, because if China wants to modernize quickly in the future, the only source of industrial materials is the United States.

The recent Communist Party's takeover of American flour in Tianjin is also a new thing. Although the original intention of American economic aid to China was to strengthen China's anti-communist forces, on the surface it was to aid the Chinese people with food and medicine. The result of the post-war American aid being distributed by the Kuomintang was that it all went into the pockets of officials. Therefore, the American side replaced it with its own distribution. The Communist Party and other parties believe that this matter is an undeniable interference in China's internal affairs. When the Communist Party captured Tianjin, they took over 5,000 tons of American flour and distributed it without the consent of American officials. Washington's response to this matter was only to abolish the economic aid agencies in Tianjin and Beiping.

Recently, the anti-"American Imperialism" sentiment has been very intense, and two American journalists have been dubbed "American Imperialist Journalists." A Communist soldier once said to an American professor: "We know America. Some of the people there want to kill us. Some of the people want to help us. But most Americans know very little about China and pay no attention to it." What is most noteworthy is that Truman Road in Tianjin has been renamed, but Roosevelt Road has not been changed.

Commanders of the "People's Army" on the Henan-Hubei Front: (Above) Commander Zhang Gan (Below) Deputy Commander Wang Jingsong (Reported by our special correspondent Fang Canglang)

### The Smiling Tiger Understands the People's Suffering - Encouragement Replaces the Whip

— Our special correspondent Fang Canglang

[Dispatch from Xinyang, This Newspaper, 21st] This reporter was determined to interview Commander Zhang Gan, Deputy Commander Wang Jingsong, and Chief of Staff Huo Guannan. When the car arrived at a certain place, General Zhang Gan, who was 56 years old, was already waiting in front of the door, with a face full of smiles, showing all his charms, greeting and shaking hands with each of our colleagues. His inherent light and heat, in the eight years of the War of Resistance and the recent three years, had illuminated every peak of the Dabie Mountains, and every inch of land in the border area of ​​the four provinces of southern Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Hubei, warming the hearts of thousands of soldiers and civilians. He has light, heat, and confidence, so he can always stand and smile in this extremely dangerous era - a living, foolish "smiling tiger."

After the greetings were over, the reception proceeded according to the scheduled program, unfolding scene by scene. First, we listened quietly to General Zhang's views on the current situation. He said, "It's best to make peace. If the other party is unwilling to negotiate peace with sincerity, and even gradually approaches and attacks, then we are ready to accept orders and respond to the battle in accordance with the will of the people." Speaking of this, the reporter asked him: What if the other party attacks now? He suddenly laughed up to the sky and replied: "At this time, we express our welcome. It's okay to slow down a little, because when the other party adds a bit of strength, we will double our enrichment and double our strength. However, for the sake of the people's lives and property, peace is better!" From this conversation, we discovered that their fighting will is beyond rationality, and their fighting strength is built on the basis of the people's conscience. The people of Henan and Hubei provinces have unanimously given the Zhang Gan Corps a new title of "People's Army" to replace the whip with encouragement, and the Zhang Gan Corps really deserves it.

Folk Music Raises the Dragon Dance and Beats the Taiping Drum

The second item of the reception was to listen to the situation, look at the charts. Speaking of the situation, what can be reported has probably already been seen in the special dispatch of this newspaper. What needs to be supplemented is that the Communist army is exerting its strength in the northeast of Zhumadian to deal with the two divisions of the National Army, Liao and Yu, and other troops, about 30,000 in number, who were forced to surrender in Xuzhou and transferred to southern Henan, but have not yet disarmed. One part has already surrendered their guns and left Shao, and another part is discussing credit issues with the Communist army. On the west side of the railway, the 30,000 Communist troops on the line from Wuyang to Tanghe are constantly reorganizing and successively heading to Xiangfan and Shayang. The Communist army's attempt to control both sides of the Yangtze River with superior forces and firepower in the shallow and difficult terrain of Shayang, forcibly cross the Yangtze River, and try to enter Sichuan in the west and spy on Jiangxi and Gan in the east is worth noting, but there is no need to be alarmed, because their chips are not yet sufficient, and the National Army's fishing nets have been spread to both sides of the river with red arrows, waiting for an opportunity to catch them. In addition, from a chart that we were allowed to see by the Zhang Corps, we can see that they have achieved a B-level effect in deploying intelligence networks and anti-espionage networks. This is the first factor in victory. Compared with those who have put in A-level efforts for this but only get D-level results, there is really no comparison.

The third item of the reception was of course indispensable eating, drinking and entertainment. Fortunately, our "press corps" only got Chief of Staff Huo so excited that one of them got drunk, but they didn't bother their ancestors' soldiers, and still took the car back to the train to sleep. Before falling asleep, I remembered that at the evening party in the corps headquarters, I had seen their officers and soldiers and cooks, like a group of happy children, crowding behind and on both sides of General Zhang, clapping their hands without any scruples, shouting, and laughing. They are really a happy big family sharing weal and woe.

The next day was the Yuan Festival and the Folk Music Festival. Our group of small "press corps," who rarely go to the countryside, after visiting the local people's representatives and the Wuhan Newspaper Association's representatives who gave General Zhang Gan two banners with the words "Deterring the Central Plains" and "Barrier of the Yangtze and Han Rivers," saw the people from the four townships dancing the dragon lantern. The scene was crowded with people, the dragon lanterns were colorful, and there were more than 100 of them. In the deafening sound of drums and firecrackers, this was indeed a rare sight. At this time, General Zhang Gan shook his whole body again, filled his face with a smile, and stuffed a Victory brand cigarette into the mouth of each dragon to reward the dragon and the farmers who danced the dragon with a piece of kindness. Even after the dragon flew away and the people dispersed, the laughter still lingered in my ears.

Peaceful Greetings to the Rooster's Long Cries in Xinyang

The Hengdian interviewing work came to an end. The news special car we were riding in decided to be attached to the express train departing from northern Hubei on the 13th, heading straight to Xinyang. Before the departure, we asked the military to remove the telephone installed in the sleeping car room and bid farewell to the representatives of all walks of life in the local area, and continued to move north.

The train departed north from Hengdian, passing through Xiaogan, Huayuan, Guangshui, and Wushengguan in northern Hubei, to reach Jigong Mountain, the dividing line between Henan and Hubei provinces, at 4 pm. Jigong Mountain is the only summer resort in central China, with a station located at the foot of the mountain. Unfortunately, due to the incessant war in the past 11 years, the trees on the mountain have been decreasing day by day, and many houses are also dilapidated. Looking out of the window, only white snow is seen, and the sky is vast and desolate, which makes people feel that the mountains and rivers are not as good as before. On the day before the Spring Festival, when Xinyang took emergency evacuation measures, an interesting episode actually occurred here after Queshan, Huangchuan, and Xinyang. Fang Xiangli, the director of the mountain administration, was kidnapped by a Lishan county head who was both a bandit and an official, and more than 30 rifles were confiscated. When the news spread, all the grass and trees on Jigong Mountain were soldiers. In fact, the large Communist army did not go south. Before long, the Zhang Corps went north, and the confused county head took advantage of the situation and sent the director and weapons back to their original places. Then it was said that there was nothing wrong. However, the local tyrants in Queshan did invite local Communists pretending to be Liu's army, but they also retreated. The so-called Eight People's Security Committee of Xinyang also ended hastily after the arrival of the large army. The most miserable thing is that the enthusiastic gentlemen representatives of Huangchuan who advocated peace have not been released after being detained by the Communist army. The storm of the end of the century has blown down the confused bugs who lack stability, which is also a tragedy of the times.

The car stopped for a moment and moved slowly. At about 5 pm, it arrived in Xinyang. When the special car entered the station, the young "press corps" members who were traveling together saw that Xinyang was indeed safe and sound after their separation, and their singing and whistling rose together. After we got off the bus and thanked Secretary-General Luo of the Provincial Government, Wang Dingjiu and Zhang Liao of the Fifth Sui District Command, and the representatives of the Zhang Corps's army headquarters one by one, we immediately organized ourselves to take a car into the city. Because the car we were riding in was a military vehicle, there was no need to present identity cards or receive bamboo slips and other procedures. In less than ten minutes, we arrived at the Sui District Guest House in the city. After dinner, Commander Zhang Zhen held a tea party to entertain the reporters and reported in detail on the military and political situation in southern Henan.

Zhang Yisan is Kind, Li Bengong is Amazingly Strong

Wuhan is adjacent to southern Henan, and the reporters have a considerable understanding of the past distribution of the National Army's troops in southern Henan, the posture of the Communist army in front of them, the "high opinions" of the veterans who participated in the meeting in Xinyang on the issue of peace and war, and the difficult situation of that prominent, long candle-shaped tip of the Pinghan Line from Zhumadian to Xinyang. Therefore, at the tea party, there were few questions about the past situation in Xinyang, and there was no mention of a certain army that ran from Xinyang to the Yellow Crane Tower before the Spring Festival, because that unit should have gone to the rear for reinforcements long ago. However, General Zhang Zhen, who was honest, honest, and clumsy in diplomatic rhetoric, did not blame others for the responsibility of the hasty evacuation. He only lightly said a few words about the pain, stuffiness, and even internal and external injuries he suffered since the withdrawal from Kaifeng. Finally, he said in a tone close to grief and indignation: "We have 100% sincerity and confidence in 'peace,' but we almost suffered a big loss and can't lose heart anymore."

After the reception, our group went to the army headquarters of the Zhang Gan Corps's army to visit Army Commander Li Benyi (nicknamed Yaoge). This general is no stranger in the memories of the people in the southeast. After "August 13," in the Battle of Yuncaobang, he led a regiment of troops to severely damage the enemy and calmly covered the retreat of tens of thousands of troops in Hangzhou. This battle made him famous and restored the reputation of the "Steel Army," laying the foundation for his position today. He is 44 years old this year and is originally from Guilin. In his 20 years of military life, he has been a soldier, received higher military education, walked over thousands of mountains, and fought more than 150 tough battles, but he has never suffered a big loss. His fighting spirit can be called a piece of tempered steel in this large corps. However, when he applies it to political awareness and displays it in front of the vast public, he can immediately turn into a gentle force, so that everyone who approaches him can quickly understand his wit, resilience, and fire-like enthusiasm, which is an essential element for solving any difficult problem.

The Arrow Can Be Placed Anywhere at Any Time

That evening, when he met with us twice, he reported many situations very faithfully. He estimated that there were about seven columns of the Communist army in front of southern Henan, and the northeast was being digested. Some bones and hairs were being escorted from the Xuzhou-Bengbu area, and the Communist army was hovering southwest of the railway waiting for an opportunity. No matter where the other party's arrow is inserted, their brothers can deploy at any time to meet them, because they regard protecting the territory and ensuring the safety of the people as their duty, and strong confidence is what they should have.

That night at midnight, after exploring the situation of the offensive and defensive battle in Zhengyang County, north and east of Zhumadian, we listened to what Army Commander Li said: When Li's army went north, passing through Dongshuanghe and other places, because the soldiers would rather get wet in the rain and freeze under the eaves than live in civilian houses, and would not arbitrarily move firewood outside civilian houses, they moved the local residents, who asked the soldiers to bake by the fire and eat salted meat rice cakes. Some touching stories made us forget our fatigue. Strict military discipline is the key to the success of the Zhang Corps, so when they arrive in a place, the hearts of the people are settled down, and the other party, when they hear that Zhang Gan's troops are coming, although they are not as fearful as Cao Cao's troops when they encounter Zhang Fei and flee immediately, they have been extra cautious for a long time. No wonder foreign news agencies have repeatedly mistakenly reported that the Zhang Gan Corps has been transferred east, which shows that this news is very important. The Wuhan reporters stayed in Xinyang for two days, in addition to visiting military and political circles and participating in the symposiums of the provincial government and the Sui district, they also went deep into the folk to visit in groups. The opinions collected from the general public have been provided to all parties for reference and improvement, and they are particularly concerned about improving the treatment of soldiers. With everything settled, our group took the special express train on the Pinghan Line to Zhumadian at 8:30 am on the 15th to visit the soldiers and civilians on the front line.

### Unprecedented Major Robbery in Guashang, Changzhou

[Dispatch from Wujin, This Newspaper, 26th] Chenjia Village, Banshang, Dongxiang, Changzhou, has only fifteen or sixteen households, most of whom make a living by farming, making bricks and tiles, and making gluten. They work hard all year round, barely able to keep warm and full. On the 24th of this month, suddenly 50 or 60 bandits arrived, each holding flashlights, long and short guns, and two machine guns. They claimed to be the "New Fourth Army," some in yellow uniforms and some in plain clothes. First, they forced the head of the village to knock on the doors of each household, ordering all the men, women, old and young, more than 50 people in the entire village, to concentrate in the Land Temple in the west of the village, claiming to hold a meeting. The bandits then arbitrarily washed and looted each household, and fired several warning shots, lasting three or four hours. Then they carried stolen goods and fled northward on a large ship that had been prepared in advance. After the incident, each household checked and found that they had lost more than 100 shi of white rice, as well as countless clothes, chickens, and other livestock. On the 26th, the case was reported to the county government.

### Zhenjiang Lieutenant Platoon Leader Accused of Acting as a Private

[Dispatch from Zhenjiang, This Newspaper, 26th] Lieutenant Platoon Leader Wu Gongnuo of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army took a car to Gaozi. When he arrived at Shibaidu, he was taken to the team headquarters by a soldier of a certain unit and used as a private. Wu escaped that night, but his symbols, fake certificate, a gold ring, and 200 yuan in gold were all "confiscated." He is now reporting to the division headquarters and asking the Ministry of National Defense to investigate.

### Outside Stories from the Capital's Press Circles

Sealing and Acknowledgement [Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] After the Nanjing People's Daily "died," there has been no sign of resurrection. Two editors of the newspaper, who were previously detained by the Capital Garrison Headquarters, have now been released on bail after claiming "youthful ignorance." The only condition is that they must publish an acknowledgement in the newspaper after their release. On the 25th, the Central Daily News here published an acknowledgement from the two editors, the words of which are filled with untold bitterness. The acknowledgement is transcribed below: "Acknowledgement from Zai Shou-shan and Li Ji, editors of the Nanjing People's Daily: It is hereby announced that the news item published in this newspaper on February 1st concerning Chief Huang of the Capital Police Department was entirely without factual basis. A reporter of this newspaper casually released news, reversing right and wrong, disrupting public perception, and deliberately slandering the head of public security. According to the law, we should be punished. Zai Shou-shan and Li Ji, as editors, failed to carefully examine the content and were exploited by others, causing this error. We deeply regret and are extremely ashamed! Besides awaiting legal action, there is no room to plead for leniency. However, Chief Huang is benevolent and compassionate, not only unwilling to pursue the matter but also kindly pleaded with the Garrison Headquarters to impose a lighter sentence and grant bail. We are deeply grateful and hereby issue this acknowledgement!"

Furthermore, after the Nanjing People's Daily was sealed, the New China Daily News here published an editorial protesting the injustice of the People's Daily and submitted a protest to the Garrison Headquarters. After the editorial was published, the newspaper was punished that very day with a one-month suspension. (Ai )

Playing a Drama? Or a Drill? [Nanjing, 21st Dispatch] The Daily Evening News here published a news item on the 17th entitled "Storm Clouds Gathering Over Both Banks of the Yangtze, Fierce Fighting at Wujiang Last Night." The Garrison Headquarters was greatly angered, resulting in the newspaper being forced to publish a correction notice in all the newspapers in the capital.

The evening edition of a certain major newspaper called Luo Chunbo, the director of the political work department of the Garrison Headquarters, to inquire about the actual situation on both sides of the Yangtze. Luo said on the phone, "I solemnly inform you that both sides of the Yangtze are extremely peaceful. The soldiers at the front are there playing a drama." The next day, the newspaper prominently published the news "Soldiers on Both Sides of the Yangtze Held Military Exercises Yesterday." Luo was greatly shocked upon seeing this. After inquiring, he learned that "playing a drama" had been misheard as "military exercises." As a result, another correction was issued.

Interestingly, after the newspaper published this erroneous news item, the China Times here reprinted it in the same way, changing the source to "Our Newspaper Reports." This can't help but be seen as a joke. (Ai Xiong)

Due to Delayed Delivery of Materials for the Large Bridge in Zhangshu, Only the Design for a Temporary Bridge Suitable for Low Water Levels Before March Has Been Delivered So Far. Steel Beams Are Urgently Needed Before the High Water Level Rises to Complete the Bridge. (Report from Our Reporter, Zao)

### Zhangshu Bridge Project: Steel Beams Still Need to Be Resolved

— Our Reporter, Liu Zao

[Nanchang, 21st Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The reconstruction project of the Zhangshu Bridge on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and the bridge over the Gan River tributary was delayed last winter due to the failure of the Canadian steel beams to arrive on schedule. Only 50% of the concrete pier base project for the two bridges and the riverbed dredging project were completed by September of the 37th year. Since the opening of the Nanchang-Zhuzhou section of the railway, transportation has been busy. Therefore, a temporary bridge, a challenging project, was completed on December 1st of last year to connect the 1,300-kilometer through-train route. However, the temporary bridge was initially built with the expectation of only being used during the low water season before this year's spring floods due to a shortage of timber, the excessive width of the river, and other difficulties. According to Huang Shou-yi, the director of the bridge construction office, and Zou Yue-sheng, the director of the Nanchang-Zhuzhou section engineering office, who recently came to the province from Zhangshu, the water level of the Gan River has gradually risen. This year's highest water level has reached 55.7 meters, only 2.2 meters below the standard high water level of 58 meters from the bridge surface. Although the railway bureau once planned to raise the bridge surface, a decision has not been made due to material constraints and safety concerns regarding train operation after raising the bridge height. If the water level of the Gan River rises further, it may be necessary to resume using ferries and connecting transportation on both the east and west banks when western trains arrive at Zhangshu Station in order to maintain operations. It is reported that six spans of the main bridge steel beams have arrived in Shanghai, and another three spans were on a foreign vessel that caught fire off the coast of Taipei on the 10th of this month and must be transferred to Kowloon for unloading. The existing steel beams only account for 10% of the materials required for the bridge site. Therefore, when the U.S. aid investigation team arrived in Zhangshu, they paid special attention to the bridge project and unanimously agreed to urgently find solutions to fulfill the important mission of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway in the future.

### "Okay! Okay!" A Record of the President of Jinhua Yingshi University Being Attacked

— Zhang Zhen

[Jinhua, 21st Dispatch] Tang Jihe, the president of Yingshi University, rushed back to Jinhua from Nanjing. When school started, he was naturally very busy. At 12 o'clock on February 15th, as usual, he took a rickshaw from the school to go home. When the rickshaw approached the slope near Tongsheng Lane, a young man of about twenty years old, wearing a black uniform, overcoat, parted hair, and pointed leather shoes, suddenly emerged from another lane. He struck the president on the back of his head with a thick wooden stick. One blow was not enough, and he followed up with three or four more blows. Clearly, this young man was prepared to kill him. At that time, President Tang's head was bleeding profusely, and he fell unconscious. When the soldiers who were pulling the rickshaw wanted to catch the assailant, the young man had already fled through the streets and alleys. The next day, the Jinhua Minbao wrote: "The news of President Tang being attacked shocked the entire mountain city. That a giant in the local education community would be ambushed is a significant event. The reasons for the attack are subject to various speculations. However, it is said that when President Tang was attacked, he did not cry for help and instead said, 'Okay! Okay!' Could it be that he possessed the spirit of Jesus?" As for why a university president would be ambushed, some say that it was done by the thirty-nine students who were expelled last semester. Others say that it was the work of students from various places who wanted to audit classes at Yingshi University but were angered by the president's refusal to admit them. Still others say that it was instigated by several professors who were previously dismissed by President Tang. There are even those who say that it is related to the students of Jinhua Middle School (referring to the conflict between some students of Yingshi University and Jinhua Middle School over watching a play on the night of May 28th last year)... As for the exact reason, I think only President Tang, who is still in the hospital, can answer.

### Letter from the Yangzhou Overseas Students Association

To the Yangzhou overseas students who contacted through the newspaper's social services column: We have received all your letters and are now replying as follows: (1) We hope everyone will unite to jointly solve all the difficulties we face abroad. (2) More than 80% of the students are staying with relatives and friends along the Jinghu Railway line and are unemployed. The problem of food and shelter is gradually becoming difficult. We appeal to the community to extend a helping hand to rescue this large group of students. (3) The Ministry of Education originally had a temporary school in Suzhou, but when you wrote, the Ministry of Education had moved to Guangzhou, and the school had stopped recruiting due to a lack of public funds. It is said that it will be restored soon. In addition to finding out more information, we hope that everyone will listen for good news and prepare their documents and luggage. (4) Regarding the employment issue, we intend to introduce talents to various counties. We hope that students will introduce themselves to jobs that interest them. (5) The order in our hometown is as before, and the schools have resumed classes. In the future, we plan to report hometown news at any time.

There are rumors that schools such as Jiangsu Yangzhou Middle School, Jiangsu Taizhou Middle School, and Jiangsu Yancheng Middle School have established a temporary school in Qianyuan Temple, Qizishan, Suzhou. If it is confirmed, we plan to apply on behalf of the students from private schools, especially those who want to return to school to study.

### Central Bank Circular Cancels Restrictions: Foreign Exchange Certificates Can Be Freely Traded; Detailed Rules for the New Plan Will Be Announced Successively

The Central Bank previously issued Circular No. 170 to prevent speculation, which restricted the trading of foreign exchange certificates, meaning that only importers and exporters could trade them. After the announcement of the financial and economic plan, this circular should be cancelled. The bank issued a circular on the 28th, informing the designated banks that, from now on, foreign exchange certificates can be freely traded.

Foreign exchange transfer certificates yesterday (28th) initially rose but then softened in the market. They opened at 2,750 yuan in the morning, and market sentiment was quite strong, rising to 2,800 yuan. At that time, the Central Bank sold off at high prices, and the price was eventually pushed back down, closing at 2,660 yuan in the afternoon, but still slightly up 10 yuan from the previous weekend.

President Liu of the Central Bank returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 27th. He separately invited financial leaders to exchange views on the implementation of the financial and economic reform plan and convened heads of various departments of the Central Bank to discuss relevant implementation issues. According to the spokesperson of the Central Bank:

(1) Detailed rules for the implementation of the financial and economic reform plan will be announced successively. Those related to the Central Bank are already being handled.

(2) The gold yuan will continue to be issued, but it will be compressed as much as possible. The spirit of the entire financial and economic plan is to compress the issuance of gold yuan.

(3) President Liu invited financial leaders and experts to a meeting on the evening of the 27th to exchange views on the implementation of the financial and economic plan.

(4) The open market for gold and silver is being discussed.

(5) There are countermeasures to curb rising prices. In addition to selling materials, gold, silver certificates, foreign exchange certificates, and others can be sold at any time.

(6) Gold and silver deposits have not yet been decided.

(7) The purchase price of foreign currency will be posted from the first day.

(8) The gold yuan is the only standard currency. All sales contracts and accounting should be based on the gold yuan. The law will never allow silver dollars to be used as the unit of measure.

### The Central Bank Approves Relaxed Foreign Exchange Settlement for Price Discounts and Commission Payments

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to information from the Export Management Committee: After export goods are exported, their quality may be reduced due to force majeure, causing foreign buyers to request price discounts upon receiving the goods. Such price discounts can often reach 5/1000 of annual exports for reputable exporters. In addition, exported goods are often trivial and difficult to handle, or the sales areas are remote, so foreign agents take the opportunity to demand higher commissions. The allocation of these two types of foreign exchange was originally deducted from the export foreign exchange that exporters sold to the Central Bank under the current exchange settlement situation. However, in order to prevent the waste of foreign exchange funds, the Central Bank had strict approval standards for the allocation of these two types of foreign exchange in the past. Exporters often found themselves in difficulty as a result. In order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants, the Export Management Committee had repeatedly discussed this issue with the Central Bank, requesting a relaxation. The Central Bank has now agreed that if Chinese exporters experience requests for price discounts from buyers after the export of their goods, they can provide accurate and reasonable documents, such as public notary office weighing lists and laboratory reports. The Central Bank may consider the actual situation and approve the settlement. As for applications for commissions from foreign agents, if the commission rate for the exported goods is within the range of export commission rates set by the Central Bank, it will be handled according to regulations. If the commission rate for the exported goods has not yet been determined, it can be handled with reference to the accurate supporting documents provided by the exporter, but the amount should not exceed 5% of the total F.O.B. value of the exported goods.

### Money Tightens in the Afternoon as State Banks Deposit Funds

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the money market in the city was initially loose, with the daily interest rate at 35-40 yuan per thousand yuan in the morning. Due to tightened money in the afternoon, it rose to over 50 yuan, with the highest reaching 60 yuan. Yesterday, due to heavy expenditures for military and government expenses, a large amount of funds flowed out of state banks, but the Bank of Communications sold a large amount of foreign exchange settlement certificates, resulting in a net deposit of over 800 million, which tightened the money market. Yesterday, the net deposit of state banks was 548.92 million, the net deposit of foreign banks was 833.8 million, the net deposit of the large clearing house was 653.9 million, and the net outflow of the small clearing house was 1286.2 million.

### Interest Rates for Deposits and Loans in the Silver and Money Industry Will Be Increased Separately Starting Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] Interest rates for deposits and loans in the silver and money industry will be increased starting today. The deposit interest rate will be adjusted from 7.5 yuan per thousand yuan per day to 10 yuan per thousand yuan per day, which is equivalent to 9 jiao per month; the loan interest rate will be adjusted from 30 yuan per thousand yuan per day to 40 yuan per thousand yuan per day, which is equivalent to 1.2 yuan per month. The interbank daily interest rate will also be increased from 24 yuan per thousand yuan to 32 yuan, which is equivalent to 9.6 jiao per month. In addition, the monthly interest rates for deposits and loans in the silver and money industry for this month are 225 yuan per thousand yuan for deposits, which is equivalent to 2 jiao and 5.5 fen per month, and 1,800 yuan per thousand yuan for loans, which is equivalent to 1.8 yuan per month.

### Sharp Opening, Sluggish Close for Chinese Stocks

Yesterday's stock market opened with favorable conditions, boosting morale among both industry insiders and outsiders, who actively pursued aggressive buying, leading to strong gains. Around 10:30 AM, many stocks reached their daily limits. However, some traders opted to sell at higher prices, while new buyers remained cautious, leading to a dissipation of momentum. The release of an increased cost of living index further prompted profit-taking, with the Wing On Textile Company (永紗) showing early signs of sluggishness, followed by other stocks softening as well. Closing prices were generally at the lower end of the day's range, resulting in overall gains ranging from one cent to 10.03 yuan compared to last Saturday. Taiwan Sugar (台糖) rose 1950 yuan, closing at the upper limit. Chun Hsing Paint (振漆) and Wing Yip Enterprises (永業) had buy orders at the upper limit. Other stocks that reached the upper limit included China Flour Mill (華豐), New Asia Hotel (新亞), Shanghai Cement (上泥), Wing Fung Textile (榮豐), Chin Hsing Spinning (勤興), Mei Ah Tobacco (美亞), Commercial Press (商務), and China Match (火柴), totaling eight. Wing On Textile's high was 3.41 yuan and its low was 3.18 yuan, a difference of 0.23 yuan, with an overall gain of 0.12 yuan. Trading volume was substantial, with a total of 4.8244 billion shares traded in half a day, including 62.7 million shares of Wing On Textile and 2.777 billion shares of King Fok Corporation (景福).

### Mixed Fortunes for Foreign Stocks

Foreign stock market performance was mixed. Ewo Cotton Mills (怡紗) traded at 6300 and 6500 yuan, an increase of 300 yuan compared to the previous day. British-American Tobacco (英聯) remained flat, the same as last Saturday's closing price. Wheelock & Co. (會德豐) saw a significant increase due to reports of financial and commodity price increases outside the trading circle, reaching 17,000 yuan, up 1,000 yuan from the previous day. Other stocks remained relatively unchanged.

### Over 150 Jewelry Stores in the City Officially Reopen Today

[Our Report] More than 150 jewelry stores affiliated with the city's Jewelry Guild have already begun unofficial business operations starting at 10:00 AM yesterday. However, as it was a trial run, there were considerable discrepancies in the quoted prices for gold ornaments, ranging from a high of 160,000 yuan per tael to a low of 156,000 yuan. These prices already include a 10% legal profit margin and operating expenses, with labor costs calculated per item. Purchases will be made at prices reduced by 10% of the selling price. Starting today, the industry has decided to officially resume business, with daily operating hours from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM. All members of the city's Jewelry Guild will display uniform prices, which will fluctuate dynamically with the market. Price quotations will be divided into three groups. The first group of 17 members is managed by Wu Pengnian of Bao Cheng Jewelry (寳成銀樓) in Xiaodongmen. The second group of 17 members is managed by Chen Dezhang of Wuhua Jewelry (物華銀樓) on Jinling Road. The third group of over 120 members is managed by Qiu Yunchang of Lao Tian Bao (老天寳) on Fuxing Road. All members will maintain constant contact with the three group leaders to obtain coordinated and accurate market prices. Furthermore, the industry has decided that today, those who use gold bullion to cast ornaments will need to pay an additional 5,000 yuan per tael to cover losses due to wastage.

### Rising Production Costs Boost Morale, Rice Prices Remain Firm, Flour, Grains, and Cooking Oil All Surge

Yesterday's rice market saw further increases. The opening market was supported by firm prices from the production areas, sharp increases in prices of other goods outside the industry, and strong overall sentiment. Prices generally rose by 3,000 yuan. Later in the day, as gold prices declined, morale weakened. In addition, rice shops had sufficient inventory, leading to sluggish sales and price declines of 400-500 yuan. Thin paddy rice was priced at 15,500 yuan, white glutinous rice at 15,300 yuan, and early indica rice and sheep indica rice were both at 15,000 yuan, while milled indica rice was at 14,800 yuan. The market registered 2,637 piculs of rice arriving yesterday.

Flour prices surged sharply. After the market opened, spurred by increases in other goods outside the industry, Lao Che (老車) flour quickly opened above 7,000 yuan. Prices briefly retreated in response to news of falling rice prices, but ample credit and heavy replenishment by local merchants, as well as significant buying by northern merchants, led to a rebound, with a closing price of 7,350 yuan. Ping Chuan (兵船) flour opened at 6,500 yuan, and strong sales drove the closing price up to 6,850 yuan. After the market closed, retail investors aggressively bought, pushing the final price up to 7,000 yuan. Bran was heavily bought by merchants from other provinces, rising by over 20%, with large bags of Fu Yan (阜鹽) selling for 5,560 yuan.

Miscellaneous grains experienced a frenzy of price increases. Soybeans were heavily bought by oil mills, with both Zha Dou (乍豆) and Che Dou (車豆) surging by 30%. Raw peanuts and sesame seeds were in high demand from local merchants and oil mills, with prices rising by 20% to 40%. Corn was heavily bought by the Qing Bang (靑帮), leading to a surge of over 30%. Red sorghum was in high demand from distilleries, soaring by 40%, with both ginger and Ming Guang (明光) closing near 7,000 yuan.

The cooking oil market suddenly soared due to ample credit, rising gold and foreign exchange prices, and strong investor confidence. Soybean oil opened with a surge of 6,000 yuan. Retail investors were active in the middle of the day, with prices reaching as high as 67,000 yuan. At the close, many sellers took profits at the high prices, and smaller reports from outside the trading circle led to a slight decline, with a closing price of 65,000 yuan. Crude oil supplies were relatively scarce, driving prices up by 8,000 yuan, with Qingdao Ji Tong (靑島吉桶) breaking through the 70,000 yuan mark. Crude vegetable oil and sesame oil both showed strength. Soybean cakes were heavily sought after by merchants from other provinces, with the most dramatic price increases. Chang Zi (長字) cakes briefly reached 8,000 yuan.

### Silk and Satin Surge

High-grade raw silk for separate orders opened at 820,000 yuan yesterday morning. Subsequently, the China Silk Company (中蠶公司) sold 20 piculs of Grade D Lion and Tiger brand silk, which was bought by local silk factories at a price of US$2.45 per pound, settled at an exchange rate of 2600 yuan, equivalent to 850,000 yuan per picul in gold yuan. As conditions in various markets shifted, the price of high-grade raw silk for separate orders rose to 930,000 yuan at the close, an increase of approximately 100,000 yuan from last Saturday. Other grades attracted little interest.

Artificial silk from Tianqiao (天橋) opened at 725,000 yuan, dropping to 705,000 yuan at one point. Snia Viscosa (斯尼亞西石) fell to 700,000 yuan. Prices rebounded at the noon close, ending at 780,000 yuan, also an increase of approximately 100,000 yuan from last Saturday. Arbitrage remained at 40%.

Huaqiang (華强) quilt covers opened at 550,000 yuan and closed at 505,000 yuan. Artificial silk quilt covers opened at 395,100 yuan and closed at 353,500 yuan. Bique crepe (碧縐) rose to 1,745 yuan. Prices of other items generally increased as well.

### Market Ramblings

— A Spectator

The Winds of the Stock Market May Shift Tonight

Yesterday, the general market trend was up first, then down. The rumors of tighter credit circulating over the weekend, coupled with the pervasive "peaceful atmosphere" in the newspapers, were both reflected in yesterday's market.

However, the central bank's public denial of ending the issuance of gold yuan notes did not have much impact, nor did the rumors circulating in the market of issuing large 500-yuan notes.

The weekend rumors took effect yesterday, while the new events that occurred yesterday did not. This shows that the market yesterday was already tightly controlled over the weekend. Without the backing of major players, how could one have such power?

In this situation, one should be careful when trying to help the market by shorting stocks. The danger is akin to licking blood off a knife's edge, and it is not something that can be done without considerable financial strength.

It is important to keep in mind that even if major players are willing to help, they understand that one can only go so far against the current. Therefore, one must be wary today. Given that it is the beginning of the month, and the central bank has publicly denied ending the issuance of gold yuan notes, perhaps it has already made its move. People in the stock market need to be even more careful.

Yesterday, yarn and cloth prices soared in a surprising performance, moving in the opposite direction to gold, silver, securities, and other commodities. Forty-two count blue phoenix yarn reaching 1 million yuan is enough to frighten anyone.

However, if one considers past market prices, it is reasonable to believe that the increase was excessive. If one considers that the transport of yarn and cloth to the south is currently being restored, and that prices in Hong Kong had stopped falling and started to rise again yesterday, then one cannot "judge the present by the past."

An important new development is that merchants from Hong Kong and Guangdong are buying in large quantities because the market for yarn and cloth in Hong Kong had temporarily declined due to the resumption of transport from this area, and had been quiet for almost three weeks. Last weekend, the market rebounded sharply due to large orders from South Africa, which was then reflected in the local market yesterday. Amidst the talk of a "peaceful atmosphere," the grain market should have been the first to be affected, leading the decline. Unexpectedly, the opposite happened, with rice and flour prices soaring yesterday, and cooking oil also rising sharply.

Why is this the case? The reason is very simple: the allocation price for household rice this period may relapse into chronic problems. Ignoring the fact that there is no news of ration coupons, it is a matter of hidden meaning. However, two things cannot be ignored: yesterday, Wuxi white glutinous rice fell by more than 500 yuan, and flour and wheat also fell by a significant amount.

Another thing is that after the United Nations lifted the global allocation system for cooking oil, oil prices in various countries have fallen sharply. In Hong Kong, for example, vegetable oil and tea oil have fallen by 10-20%.

However, in recent years, the local market has changed into a playing field, and if the field changes, sales can be ignored.

### Increased Allocation of Rubber Products

Factory Prices Expected to Increase by 20%

There are reports that factory prices for rubber products will be adjusted again, increasing by another 20%. Tire and rubber shoe merchants have been raising their selling prices to avoid losses from difficulty in replenishing stock after sales. However, recent large allocations from factories have led to abundant supply in the market. Quoted prices in the market have not been excessively high. Double Coin (雙錢) men's overshoes are selling for 12,900 yuan per dozen, large flat boots for 16,800 yuan, and high boots for 59,000 yuan, only slightly higher than last weekend. Trading in raw rubber is very sparse, with prices quoted at 500 yuan per pound yesterday morning.

### Cotton Yarn Remains Firm, Boosting Morale in the Cloth Market

The trend for cotton yarn remains strong, with continued morale boosting amidst loose credit conditions. Market prices continue to rise firmly. Yesterday, buying interest in the market remained very strong. Although those holding stock were reluctant to sell, fine yarn prices rose more sharply, while coarse yarn prices showed a slight increase.

Forty-two count blue phoenix yarn initially opened at a low of 870,000 yuan, then was bid up to 1 million yuan at one point, finally settling at 900,000 yuan, up 100,000 yuan.

Forty count blue phoenix yarn also rose by 100,000 yuan. Thirty-two count silver moon yarn was quoted down from 770,000 yuan to 700,000 yuan, but ended up surging by 110,000 yuan.

Twenty-one count double horse yarn for immediate delivery opened at 580,000 yuan, rose to 615,000 yuan, and then fell back to 560,000 yuan at the close, up 30,000 yuan from Saturday. Factory orders are currently at 530,000 yuan, with orders for delivery the day after tomorrow at 548,000 yuan.

Twenty count double horse yarn rose by 60,000 yuan, closing at 535,000 yuan. Other yarns, such as sixteen count coarse yarn, also showed strength. The cloth market was buzzing with rumors of favorable buying conditions, boosting morale. Combined with loose credit conditions, price fluctuations in other goods outside the industry, and renewed buying interest from industry players and merchants from Guangdong, who were actively replenishing stock, buying interest surged again, and cloth prices rose sharply.

High-grade fine cloth initially opened at 21,700 yuan, then rose to 23,200 yuan, finally settling at 23,000 yuan, a surge of 4,900 yuan from the weekend. Loudspeaker children's fine cloth rose by 3,700 yuan, closing at 20,600 yuan. Grade B high-grade fine cloth also rose by 3,500 yuan.

Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji (元嗶嘰) initially traded down from 20,400 yuan to 20,100 yuan, but rebounded to 21,000 yuan at the close, a jump of 4,000 yuan. Golden Luck Wonderful Dance Yuan Biji opened at 19,700 yuan in the morning, broke through the 20,000 yuan mark at noon, and finally closed at 20,300 yuan, up 3,600 yuan from before. The factory price for 290 high-grade shirting (士林) rose to 45,500 yuan. All other cloths also reached new highs.

### China Textile Sells Yarn as Usual

[Our Report] The China Textile Construction Corporation (中國紡建公司) sold yarn yesterday as usual, continuing to use the quotation and approval system. A total of seven types were offered, with 221 lots sold and 91 buyers approved, with a total value of 163.04 million yuan. The selling prices for each type of yarn (in thousands of yuan) were: Eight count Sunlight (日光) at 285 yuan, sixteen count Jingyue (經月) at 455 yuan, twenty count double-strand Blue Phoenix (藍鳳) at 530 yuan, twenty-one count Fairy Peach (仙桃) second grade at 510 yuan, thirty-two count Sunlight at 630 yuan, forty count Red Treasure Light (紅寳光) at 810 yuan, and forty-two count double-strand Dragon Gate (龍門) at 830 yuan.

### Narrowing Sales Channels for Woolen Fabrics

Sales channels for woolen fabrics have been narrowing recently. Aside from some purchases by merchants from Taiwan, sales are almost entirely reliant on local demand. Sales of each product have been declining daily. The vast markets of Northeast China and North China have disappeared, and due to transportation difficulties, merchants from the southwestern provinces rarely come to Shanghai to buy. Most of the woolen fabric sales in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi have been taken by smuggled goods from Hong Kong. These are all facts. At the same time, business in Shanghai is weakening due to unstable conditions, high prices, and a gradual decline in actual sales of both Western and Chinese clothing.

### Sugar Prices Soar Across the Board

The sugar market trend yesterday was driven by actual sales from merchants in Hankou and some activity from merchants in Tianjin (although traffic in the north is blocked, merchants are still waiting for maritime transport to resume). Furthermore, the implicit interest rate has not tightened significantly, generally between 30% and 35%, resulting in brisk trading and soaring prices across the board. Grade 4.5 sugar opened at 27,800 yuan in the morning, then fluctuated around 27,000 yuan, finally closing at 27,200 yuan at noon, up over 2,000 yuan from last Saturday. Grade 3.5 sugar closed at 24,500 yuan, up 1,500 yuan. Coarse granulated sugar was at 2,600 yuan, up 2,300 yuan.

Green Sugar (靑糖) for extraction first reached 14,500 yuan, then rose to 15,000 yuan, finally closing at 155,000 yuan at noon, up 2,500 yuan. Prices for other grades also increased by about 10%.

Taiwan Sugar Corporation Approves Allocation of Coarse Granulated Sugar

[Our Report] The Taiwan Sugar Corporation (台糖公司) yesterday approved the allocation of Grade 52 coarse granulated sugar (200-斤 bags) at a price of 23,500 yuan per picul, resulting in the allocation of over 10,000 bags.

### Gold Prices Weakened Slightly in the Afternoon

High Reached 161,000

[Our Report] The gold market trend yesterday was strong first, then weak. In the morning, before the market opened, sentiment was bolstered by the strength from last weekend and rumors of the imminent issuance of large denomination notes, leading to prices being bid up across the board, already reaching 156,000 to 159,000. The market opened at a high of 158,000 to 161,000 at 9:30 AM. However, the morning saw surprisingly loose credit conditions, with an endless supply of 3.5% interest rates, so prices fluctuated between 152,000 and 158,000. Around 11:00 AM, the Bank of Communications continued to release foreign exchange transfer certificates, leading to tighter credit conditions and a gradual weakening of prices. The market closed at 148,000 to 150,000. When the market opened in the afternoon, tight credit conditions persisted, with particularly tight conditions at 2:00 PM, with prices briefly reaching a low of 147,000 to 149,000, before rebounding to 152,000 to 154,000. The market ultimately closed at the lowest level of 147,000 to 149,000.

### Sales of Gold Bonds Temporarily Suspended Yesterday

Principal to Be Drawn Tomorrow

[Our Report] Sales of the first issue of short-term gold bonds were temporarily suspended yesterday, with the principal to be drawn tomorrow. The National Bank's listed price remained at 114,500 yuan per tael, the same as last week's price. Since sales of the gold bonds began on February 11th, a total of 4,090 taels of bonds had been sold by the end of the month.

### Foundation Established Today

The members of the Short-Term Gold Bond Fund Custodial Committee for 1949, representing various related agencies and organizations, had previously nominated representatives, and the Ministry of Finance had separately appointed them. As Minister Xu was in Guangzhou, the committee could not be established. With the first drawing of principal scheduled for March 2nd, the committee is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at 4:00 PM on March 1st in the conference room on the third floor of the Central Bank of China on Nanjing East Road. It is also reported that the committee members and government representatives are Fu Rulin, Liu Gongyun, and Chen Bingzhang; the representative of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce is Zhu Huiqing; the representative of the National Association of Banks and Commercial Associations is Xu Guomao; the representative of the National Association of Money Shops is Guan Nengchuang; and the representative of the Industrial Association is Zhuang Zhihuan, among others.

### Money Exchanges Prepare to Reopen

After the Ministry of Finance announced that the free trading of gold and silver would be permitted, money exchanges in the city are preparing to reopen. Money exchanges along Jiangxi Road and Sichuan Road are currently undergoing extensive construction and renovation. According to industry insiders, money exchanges were previously ordered to dissolve. Now that the government has opened up the trading of gold and silver, members of the industry have jointly petitioned the relevant authorities for permission to reopen. Once approved, they will be able to officially resume business.

### Commercial Briefs

The timber market continues to advance, with fewer sellers in the market. Prices outside the market are quoted at 340, 350, and as high as 370. Plywood has also reached 1,200 to 1,500. Fir wood continues to jump, with prices at 100 yuan. The market outlook remains positive.

Green bricks are above the 200,000 mark, small tiles have also reached 100,000, machine-made tiles are at 140 yuan, and American-made wool felt has risen to 12,000 yuan. Rosin and asphalt are also rising, opening at 150 yuan.

The opening price for Yang Yi (陽衣) once reached as high as 10,000, but due to a sudden decline in foreign exchange transfer certificates, some wax merchants who did not sell at 3,200-3,300 yuan suffered significant losses, and transactions have therefore suddenly weakened. However, salt prices have rebounded due to high meat prices, rising from 280 yuan to 300 yuan per set.

Transportation between Shanghai and Tianjin has been disrupted for a long time, and exchange services have been suspended. It has now been learned that the Shanghai Trust Company is now resuming exchange services to Pingjin (平津, Beijing and Tianjin) due to constant requests from customers, to benefit families and relatives.

### Basketball League Second Round Begins, Jen Yu Faces McLaughlin Again, Tonight from 5:30 PM at the City Gymnasium

[Our Report] The first round of the basketball league has successfully concluded, with the exception of three matches that have been rescheduled. The second round is scheduled to begin tonight, with the main match being Jen Yu (仁餘) versus the American team McLaughlin (麥令斯). There will be two Class Two matches before the main event, starting at 5:30 PM at the City Gymnasium. Ticket prices remain the same. The schedule is as follows:

Huili (回力) vs. Huanan (華南) (Class Two B) 5:30 PM Di Xianzhang Wu Xiaodi

Typhoon (暴風雨) vs. West Qing Blue (西靑藍) (Class Two A) 6:30 PM Wang Jien Wu Shijian

Jen Yu vs. McLaughlin (Class One) 7:30 PM Chen Baolin Chen Songliang

Jen Yu has been vibrant recently, and very popular with fans, especially after their victory over the Shanghai Police a few days ago, which was quite spectacular. In addition to Wu Xinyun, Shen Pengju, Yao Wenyi, Sun Guozheng, Xu Zhongyi, and Wang Huaiding, they have also recently been joined by Cai Jindian, making their team even stronger. In the first round, Jen Yu beat McLaughlin by a large margin of 57 to 37. The American team improves with each game, and once they become familiar with the court, they are quite impressive. In the second friendly match, McLaughlin went all out and beat Jen Yu by one point, 37 to 36, avenging their previous loss. Tonight will be their third meeting. Although McLaughlin has lost all five of their games, their recent performance has been excellent. Jen Yu cannot afford to be complacent tonight. When these old rivals meet again, there will surely be a spectacular performance.

The first match, between Huili B and Huanan in Class Two B, will start first. Huili B has Bai Baokang, Wang Shide, Shang Chongyue, and Bao Youguan. These four knights easily defeated No Name in their first match, fully demonstrating their strength. However, Meng Xiancheng is unlikely to play due to a foot injury. Huanan also has well-known players such as Huang Tianlie, He Hanfu, Liu Fuqiang, and Li Xianzheng, so their team is not weak. However, Fuqiang made a mistake last week and lost to No Name, so it is likely that they will be defeated today as well.

The second match, between Typhoon and West Qing Blue in Class Two A, will feature Typhoon, a team composed of students from Nanyang Model High School. Under the guidance of American coach Stanlay Xiong, their basketball skills are impressive. West Qing Blue is more ordinary and unlikely to succeed.

Tonight's Six Team Rosters

(Huili) Bai Baokang, Wang Shide, Shang Chongling, Shang Chongyue, Bao Youguan, Meng Xiancheng, Yao Liqun, Guo Yaosong, Lu Dinghou. (Huanan) He Hanfu, Huang Tianlie, Deng Guozhang, Li Xianzheng, Liu Fuqiang, Gao Jia, Zhang Daisong, Deng Songyu.

(Typhoon) Shen Shihua, Shen Shiqing, Fu Guozhu, Weng Moyuan, Ju Kejun, Jiang Yanzhen, Ye Songqiao, Zhou Denghe, Lu Zhendong, Li Yingheng.

(West Qing Blue) Sha Linsiqi, Ke En, Makin Tuo, Bao Gu, Ge Tuolisi, Po Langning, Hui Saike.

(Jen Yu) Wu Xinyun, Yao Wenyi, Zhuang Yirong, Shen Pengju, Li Zhaohe, Wang Huaiding, Cai Jindian, Sun Guozheng, Xu Zhongyi.

(McLaughlin) Lien, Oen Gai, Gefins, Laimushan, Fulaote, Pengkesidong, Hua Erfu, Ensiweitai, Qiaokesheng, Ounasi Gudi.

### Hai Qing vs. McLaughlin Scheduled for Tomorrow

Two Friendly Matches Added Before

Three rescheduled matches remain in the Class One basketball league. The game between Hai Qing (海青) and McLaughlin has been scheduled by the Basketball Committee for tomorrow (Wednesday) at 7:30 PM at the City Gymnasium. Two friendly matches have been added before the main event. At 5:30 PM, the Ying Huang Youyi (影皇又一) team will face the Fat Team (胖隊), and at 6:30 PM, Green Forest (綠林) will face the US Navy Gantner fleet. Green Forest was the champion of Class Two last year. This year, as its players are divided among teams in Class One, it did not participate in the league. Now that Ye Yunshan, Chen Zhengmiao, and Wang Cunzhong have returned from overseas, they have reorganized and are preparing to show off in the friendly match. The US Navy fleet is new to Shanghai and has a lot of fighting power, so there will surely be many highlights. The schedule is as follows:

Youyi - Fat Team (Friendly) 5:30 PM

Green Forest - Gantner (Friendly) 6:30 PM

Hai Qing - McLaughlin (Rescheduled) 7:30 PM

### League Authorities Rectify Order

### Hong Kong Silver Shield Football Tournament: South China A Obtains the Right to the Finals; Lai Feng Jingxiang Scores with a Header; The Match Was Tense and Fierce; Deeply Touching the Hearts of the Fans

[Hong Kong dispatch] Hong Kong football is now entering a white-hot stage. The important program of the "Special Silver Shield" has also reached the finals week. South China A, which has always been called the overlord of South China, has lived up to its mission and eliminated St. Joseph's last weekend (the 26th), obtaining the right to the finals.

This game gave the people of Hong Kong a very deep impression. It was tense and exciting, like watching an American Western martial arts film. As a result, South China A won with only one goal, and it was scored with a header.

Although South China A's lineup was incomplete, and Lai "Buddha" was forced to play with an injury, so they did not perform at their due level, but because St. Joseph's strength has increased, due to the one up and one down relationship, the game was played in a disorganized and chaotic way, forming a rare and exciting event. After the war, the people in St. Joseph's still lamented the loss, but some thought that the defeat was already known in advance, and only losing one goal in the end was something to be proud of. There was also someone who, in a joking tone, asked the reporter to write about yesterday's event as a "football war of attrition in a century," but I also jokingly said, "It's already flattering enough not to write about both sides being out of shape. If we're talking about reality, it can't even be said to be the best game of the year."

Shu Ling Worked Hard and Was Very Impressive

Some people thought that Zhang Shuling was the best player on the field because he played the game in a logical and methodical way, sometimes even dribbling the ball far out to assist in the attack. However, I do not think so, because to judge whether someone played well, you also have to consider who they were responsible for guarding. If Xiweiya had been the right winger throughout the game, and Shu Ling had still had the same impressive performance, then he should be praised and praised. However, for most of the time, he was only resisting Marquis, who had injured his foot, so this criticism cannot be made. Although his extra effort should also be praised, the person I want to particularly praise is St. Joseph's Schliwa. If it weren't for his super-level performance, South China A would have won more easily. Another person to praise is Tian Xiebo. With his short stature, he was able to adapt to either wing in the group of fierce players. Although Zhu Yongqiang's offside goal was not counted in the end, he had actually scored a goal. If this person could perform more often in the South China A team, his future would be limitless. The starting lineups for both sides were as follows:

South China A

Yu Yaode

Zhang Shuling

Hou Rongsheng

Zhang Jinhai

Xie Jinhong

Liu Songsheng

Xie Jinhe

Lai Zhaorong

Zhu Yongqiang

Tian Xiebo

Feng Jingxiang

St. Joseph's

Schliwa

Xu Jingcheng

Gao Shanlong

Santos

Li Anna

Mendes

Parilla

Gan Meishi

Luo Cha

Marquis

Xiweiya

The Process is Tense and Touching

At the beginning of the game, St. Joseph's launched a strong attack, which was quite promising. Although South China A attacked twice, they were quickly repelled. In the fifth minute, the famous "Dapu" pan Songsheng suddenly fired a heavy shot from 25 yards out, but unfortunately the shot was slightly too high and only hit the crossbar, unable to enter the goal. However, the momentum was so strong that the goal frame shook a few times. Even if the goalkeeper was a celestial being, he would not be able to block the shot. After the ball rebounded, "Sheng Gu" got it again and repeated the trick, but this time he shot too high and went into the empty space. It wasn't until the ninth minute that St. Joseph's had a chance to cross the ball, but it was cleverly rejected by Jingde. After that, South China A's momentum became fierce. In the tenth minute, Zhu Yongqiang shot with force from 20 yards away, but it was caught by Schliwa. Then, Tian Xiebo crossed the ball, and Yongqiang took the opportunity to rush in and try to head the ball, but he was bravely blocked by Schliwa. In the fifteenth minute, South China A encountered a dangerous situation. At that time, Luo Cha got the ball near the goal, but his footwork was not up to par. When he tried to shoot, his knee touched the ball, missing what seemed like a sure-win opportunity.

From then on, the ball was mostly controlled by South China A. In the 22nd minute, when Feng Jingxiang cleverly crossed the ball, the other four forwards rushed in like a swarm of bees. Lai Zhaorong welcomed the ball, and the short and agile Tian Xiebo responded by dribbling the ball in and shooting. He was not in any way committing a foul, but unfortunately, Zhu Yongqiang was offside in the center at the same time. Therefore, although Tian's shot was crisp and exquisite, it still could not be counted, which was really a pity.

Not long after this incident, Tian Xiebo also skillfully shot another goal, the ball was about to enter the net from the bottom of the crossbar, but Schliwa's skill was extraordinary, and he was able to jump up in time and push the ball out. After that, South China A used short triangular passes to attack the goal very urgently, but they were still guarded by St. Joseph's players. Around the 30th minute, Marquis's foot was slightly limping, so he switched to right wing, and Xiweiya filled in as right auxiliary. At this time, Feng Ershu often had wonderful crosses, but unfortunately, the other forwards mostly failed to take advantage of this opportunity. Once, Lai Zhaorong suddenly met Ershu's wonderful ball and shot in the air, but it was caught by Schliwa because he was in the right position. Although he was knocked to the ground outside the goal line by the incoming ball, he was still able to hold the ball firmly and flip over to save the situation. Once, Jinhe also shot in the air, and once, Yongqiang shot, but they were all confiscated by Schliwa. The first half ended in a zero-to-zero draw.

South China A's Goal Encountered Great Danger

In the second half, South China A had Feng Jingxiang and Tian Xiebo switch positions. Tian's wing skills were also quite good. In the seventh minute, Zhu Yongqiang's shot was caught. In the ninth minute, Tian Xiebo crossed the ball, and Yongqiang used his head to diagonally top the ball near the goal, which seemed certain to score, because Schliwa was drawn to the right at that time, and the ball was just about to scurry into the empty space on the left. However, St. Joseph's had good luck. When Schliwa flipped over to save the ball, his finger touched the incoming ball, and it bounced diagonally out of bounds. South China A only got a corner kick, which was of no help in the end. Once again, Tian Feng exchanged passes and advanced. When crossing the ball, Yongqiang rushed in and headed the ball close to the goal, but unfortunately he missed it and lost a good opportunity. As such, South China A occupied about 80% of the attack, but the only difference was that they could not get the ball into the net. For a while, the Chinese spectators were anxious and cheered for South China A. In the 25th minute, South China A had a dangerous moment. At that time, Xiweiya suddenly shot a cold arrow from about 30 yards away. The ball came from the left of the goal, and although Yu Yaode was just able to push it away in time, he still conceded a corner kick. Xiao Gao thought that the opportunity was rare and took the corner kick himself, but he lost practice and kicked the ball behind the net, only causing the audience to laugh and ridicule. In the 32nd minute, South China A encountered a major danger again. At that time, Parilla dribbled the ball in. Although Hou Zi was chasing him and Jinhong was flanking, Xiao Pa still bravely advanced. Seeing the ball rolling towards the goal, Jingde ran out to pick it up, but because there was a family member in front of him, he couldn't help but slow down slightly. However, he was snatched by Parilla, who stole the ball and passed it back. At that time, Luo Cha welcomed it and shot at the empty goal. The ball fell under the crossbar, which was very dangerous. Fortunately, Jingde was able to anticipate the loss and quickly retreated, returning to the goal line just as the ball arrived. He jumped up in the air and pushed the ball over the top of the net, saving the catastrophic event, although he conceded another corner kick.

Ershu's Pleasing Header Succeeded

After surviving a great disaster, there must be good fortune. This is true. Just three minutes after South China A escaped the great danger, Xie Jinhe suddenly got the opportunity to shoot diagonally at the goal. The cunning Feng Jingxiang saw an opportunity to take advantage of it and rushed in at the same time. At that time, Schliwa had already taken a position and was ready to catch the ball shot by Jinhe, but before the ball reached his hand, it was shaken by Ershu's head, and the ball changed direction into the net, so South China A opened the scoring amidst thunderous cheers.

After losing this goal, St. Joseph's knew that the general trend was gone, so they made a desperate decision. Xiao Gao went out to play as a center forward, and Luo Cha retreated to play as a right back, but Xiao Gao was no longer as lively as before and had no way to retaliate. Until the 90 minutes of the game were over, the score was still a blank sheet, so South China A won the final with a score of one to zero.
