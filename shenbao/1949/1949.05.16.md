### The Communist Army on the Outskirts of Shanghai Cannot Escape Annihilation. National Army Positions Stand Firm. Huangdu and Nanxiang Abandoned; Communications to Nanhui Severed; Communist Troops Spotted Harassing the North of Hongqiao Airport, Engagement Underway

[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] The military released a battle report at 9:00 PM on May 15th:

(1) The Great Shanghai Defense Battle has now entered its fourth day. Thanks to the close coordination of our army, navy, and air force, which has unleashed its power, the invading bandits on all fronts have suffered heavy setbacks. The bandits who have been lured into several pocket-shaped positions are now doomed to annihilation. Since the evening of the 14th, the annihilation battle in the Liuhang area has also been fiercely launched. Three divisions of a certain bandit force, under the suppression of our strong artillery fire, have suffered more than 10,000 casualties. However, the bandits are constantly reinforcing and counterattacking. Our army's morale is high, and they are repeatedly charging and killing. The bandits are leaving piles of corpses. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. Furthermore, the invading bandits on the Yuepu-Yanghang line, after being surrounded, annihilated, and repelled by us, the battle situation had turned quiet by noon on the 15th.

(2) After the main forces of the 85th and 87th Divisions of the invading 29th Army suffered casualties and retreated in defeat, the bandits launched another fierce attack on our Yuepu, Yanghang, and Liuhang fronts with the main force of the 28th Army starting at 2:00 PM on the 14th. Our defending troops calmly responded and, after luring the bandits deep, gradually launched an encirclement and annihilation with the concentrated firepower of the army, navy, and air force. From the morning to noon of the 15th, more than 3,000 bandit corpses were left in front of the Liuhang and Yanghang positions. We captured countless spoils of war, and our positions remained firm.

(3) Over a thousand local communists harassed Nanhui from Fengxian, Hehe, and other places yesterday (the 14th). Communications to the outside world from that area are currently severed.

(4) According to reports, the bandit reinforcement units from the Songjiang and Suzhou areas are successively advancing towards our front lines. Our defending troops on all sides are closely watching and are determined to give the bandits a major blow.

[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] The Songhu Defense Headquarters issued a battle report:

(1) Around 6:00 PM yesterday, bandit troops of unknown strength and designation were spotted harassing our forward positions in the north of Hongqiao Airport, Nanyuan, Qibao, and Wengbanqiao. They are currently engaging with our defending troops.

(2) In the past two days, the bandits have continuously reinforced their troops and implemented a consistent "human wave" tactical charge on our positions north of Liuhang. Some attackers were identified as belonging to the 28th Army. However, they ultimately could not cross the "Lei Chi" (red line) by even a step. This is due to the proper coordination of our army, navy, and air force, the close collaboration between infantry and artillery, and especially the loyal spirit of our officers and soldiers who bravely fought for their lives. This is truly a head-on blow to the bandit army's attack on Shanghai.

[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] Military sources, 11:00 AM on the 15th: After the start of the Great Shanghai Defense Battle, according to our pre-planned strategy, we took the initiative to abandon Huangdu and Nanxiang on the 14th and concentrated our forces on the main positions, preparing to annihilate the invading bandits.

### "Sea of Fire" Eliminates the "Human Sea." The Army, Navy, and Air Force Coordinate to Unleash Their Power. Communist Corpses Litter the Fields of Yuepu and Yanghang

[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] The Songhu Defense Headquarters issued a battle report:

(1) Starting at dusk on the evening of the 14th, the 28th and 29th Armies, with a force of five divisions and one brigade, fiercely attacked our Yuepu and Yanghang positions using wave-like tactics, launching more than five consecutive assaults. All were annihilated by our loyal and brave officers and soldiers with intense firepower in front of the positions. Bandit corpses littered the fields. After this severe blow, the bandits suffered heavy casualties. After midnight, the battle subsided. Our morale is extremely high, and we are all determined to annihilate the bandits.

(2) Two divisions of the bandit 28th Army launched a fierce attack on our Liujiahang position using "human sea" tactics at dusk on the 14th. Officers and soldiers of a certain unit of our army calmly responded. By late at night, the bandits were lured into a pocket-shaped position and completely annihilated.

(3) At 10:00 AM on the 14th, our army launched a counterattack from Yuepu against the bandit 87th Division, annihilating 2,750 bandits, capturing 264 alive, and seizing more than 150 light and heavy machine guns and rifles, along with many other spoils of war.

[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] Military sources, 11:00 AM on the 15th:

(1) For days, over 20,000 of the bandit main forces have fiercely attacked our national army positions on the line north and south of Yuepu Town. Our defending troops bravely fought back in coordination with the armored units. At the same time, our navy vessels, such as ××××××, fired from the ×× area, fiercely bombarding the bandit army positions. The booming sound never ceased. A large number of warhawks also sortieed day and night, closely cooperating with the ground forces, maximizing the effect. The invading bandit army, under the combined attack of our army, navy, and air force, suffered a painful annihilation, with an estimated 5,000 bandits killed and over 800 captured. Countless light and heavy weapons, ammunition, and supplies were seized. The bandit offensive was frustrated, and they retreated in disarray. As of now, the battle situation has calmed down.

(2) Three divisions of a certain unit of the bandit main force split into groups on the 14th and fled south from Luodian, using fierce artillery fire as cover, fiercely attacking our Yanghang and Liuhang national army positions. Our defending troops bravely fought back, and a certain artillery unit also unleashed high power, firing to assist in the battle. The bandits' several fierce attacks were repelled, suffering heavy casualties that were difficult to count.

### A Tour of Wusong

[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] Although fierce battles have been raging just a few miles away for the past two nights, the town of Wusong has not suffered any war damage so far. According to a certain marine regiment commander, Wusong has not been affected by the war because the communist artillery is not yet capable of placing the town within its range. This morning, apart from sporadic artillery fire and machine-gun fire heard from somewhere for only a few seconds, Wusong is as peaceful as if there were no war, even though fierce battles were taking place in its western strongholds less than twelve hours ago, and the occurrence of battles after twelve hours is also foreseeable. It is said that at one point, the communist army was dangerously close to Song Town, but they have now been driven away, and the town can at least be temporarily safe. Morale is high on the front lines, and an optimistic atmosphere is overflowing everywhere. Some army and navy officers and soldiers talk to reporters about the war as middle school students discuss ball games, with excitement and joy. Recently, although some important strongholds have been abandoned, the spirit of the soldiers on the front lines has not been slightly diminished, and they are all deeply convinced that they can drive out the communist army. The naval side is especially confident. According to the Marine Regiment Commander, since the army has received reinforcements from the navy ships, the arrogant communist army has also transformed into caution and slightly curbed its arrogance. The Regiment Commander also told reporters that the communist army's casualties are ten times greater than the National Army's. This is due to their "human sea" tactics and because they are almost always on the offensive. Along the way, the reporter saw well-equipped national army troops heading to the front lines. In addition, there were also three or five soldiers returning from short-term leave back to the front lines. The reporter's car passed three such soldiers, who were hitchhiking. They belonged to a certain engineering unit and claimed that the unit had defeated three regiments of the communist army in a certain area. In contrast to the troops heading to the front lines, there were hordes of refugees pouring into Shanghai. The large number of people caused traffic to be blocked. The refugees all wore a calm expression, as if they were resigned to their fate. Among the crowd, there were also occasional smiling faces. The resilience of the Chinese people can be seen here.

### Songhu Defense Headquarters To Uniformly Release Battle Reports

[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] Battle reports from the Songhu area were originally uniformly released by the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Garrison Command. Now, because the Shanghai Defense Battle has begun, the Songhu Defense Headquarters is in charge of combat affairs, and the Political Warfare Department of the Headquarters has been newly established. In order to ensure the rapid transmission of war news and detailed reporting, starting today (the 16th), the Political Warfare Department of the Headquarters will be responsible for uniformly releasing the battle reports, twice a day at 10:00 AM and 9:00 PM, to be relayed by the Central News Agency.

### Wusong Fortress Is As Solid As A Rock. Naval Artillery Fire Covering Army Response Has Great Effect

[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] A spokesman for Naval Headquarters told reporters yesterday that since the 12th, the naval vessels stationed in Shanghai have been cooperating with the army and air force in participating in the Great Shanghai Defense War, and the results of the battle have been extraordinarily fruitful in recent days, especially in the past two days (the 13th) and yesterday (the 14th). Several of our ships have carried out ruthless and fierce artillery bombardment on the invading bandit troops in the Shizilin, Yuepu, Yanghang, and Liuhang areas, covering the army's response, and the effect has been great. According to reports, more than 5,000 bandit troops have been killed, and many bandit artillery positions have also been destroyed. Currently, in order to avoid naval artillery fire, the bandit army positions are gradually moving to the right wing, but because the range of the naval guns is very long, it is still difficult to escape our fierce fire net. The Wusong Fortress area is now as solid as a rock. There is absolutely no problem with this gateway of Shanghai.

Furthermore, the naval vessels participating in the Great Shanghai Defense War are in extremely high spirits. Among them, several vessels have repeatedly achieved great battle achievements in the Yangtze River Defense War. For example, the Yongjia ship once coordinated with the army on the Anqing River surface to painfully annihilate tens of thousands of head bandits. When breaking through to Shanghai, the ship bombarded the bandit army along the way, suppressing the bandit army's artillery fire and finally being able to safely pass through. Many other ships are similar, so the officers and soldiers are extremely excited about the task of defending the Great Shanghai.

### Air Force Continues to Inflict Heavy Damage on Communist Troops. Zhou Zhirou Personally Flies to the Front Lines to Command Operations

[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] According to Air Headquarters, today (the 15th) is the third day of the Shanghai Defense Battle. The Communist troops are not only deploying heavy troops to seize the key areas of Yuepu, Yanghang, Liuhang, etc., outside the Wusong Estuary, but are also densely moving their troops from Jiading and Songjiang, etc., southwest of Greater Shanghai, towards Shanghai, and are also advancing towards Chuansha from Fengxian and Nanhui east of the Huangpu River. Our army, navy, and air force are fighting bravely and bloody, and the fierce battle is being carried out intensely in the perimeter of Greater Shanghai, especially in the Yuepu, Yanghang, and Liuhang areas. The Air Force continues to work tirelessly, launching attacks in the skies over the perimeter of Greater Shanghai 24 hours a day. The results are as follows:

(1) Between Luodian and Yanghang and Liuhang, the communist troops have increased their trenches, with about 10,000 communist troops hiding in them, waiting for an opportunity to pounce on our positions. The Air Force has been suppressing and monitoring them in the air all day long, bombing and strafing them whenever they move. It is estimated that more than 2,000 communist troops were killed in the triangular area of Luodian, Yanghang, and Liuhang today (the 15th). At 11:00 AM, they also assisted our tank force in destroying three communist positions near Liuhang.

(2) There are many communist artillery positions in Xin Town. Our planes suppressed them all day long, destroying seven artillery positions, almost completely silencing their artillery positions. The communist fortifications between Xin Town and Liuhang were also bombed, causing more than 2,000 communist troops to be killed or injured here.

(3) More than 2,000 communist troops were spotted one kilometer east of Nanhui, and more than 1,000 communist troops were spotted in Zhapu. It is estimated that over 400 of them were killed or injured.

(4) More than 20,000 communist troops marching towards Shanghai in the Jiading and Songjiang areas. The vanguard arrived in Chenjiasha and suffered more than 2,000 deaths from bombing.

(5) Air Force Commander-in-Chief Zhou Zhirou, accompanied by staff officer Chen Xijian, personally flew over the front lines of Luodian, Yuepu, Shizilin, Liuhang, Songjiang, as well as the Pudong Chuansha and Nanhui areas, at 9:00 AM today (the 15th) for inspection, lasting for two hours, and directed the aircraft that were attacking the Communist troops at the time.

### Gu Zhenggang, Lei Zhen, and Fang Zhi Continue to Visit the Front Lines Yesterday to Offer Condolences

[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] Yesterday was the third day of the Great Shanghai Defense Battle. Thanks to the close cooperation of the heroic army, navy, and air force, the results of the battle have been good in recent days. Millions of citizens here are listening to the good news with excitement. Gu Zhenggang, Lei Zhen, and Fang Zhi, political committee members of the Jinghu Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters, visited the heroic soldiers who are firmly defending their positions with unlimited enthusiasm and respect yesterday. At 3:00 PM yesterday, the three personally took慰问品（慰劳品 - gifts of condolence/appreciation) to the headquarters of the Army Armored Corps to offer condolences and pay their respects. Commander Xu Tingyao and Deputy Commander Jiang Weiguo were directing operations on the front lines. Chen Shoucheng, director of the Political Warfare Department of the Headquarters, greeted them and was extremely moved by the visit of the three and reported on the recent battle situation with a firm attitude. He said that all officers and soldiers of the armored corps will do their best to achieve excellent results in the Great Shanghai Defense Battle and eliminate the bandit army. He pointed out that every officer and soldier of the armored corps who rushed to the front line has a firm belief in victory, and the combat will is especially firm. After a pleasant conversation of about twenty minutes, they said goodbye. It is heard that the three will continue to visit the front lines today to offer condolences.

### A Batch of US Troops Arrive and Land in Qingdao

Qian Dajun, Zhang Dulun, and others went to the airport to welcome them.

### Guilin Strictly Prohibits Secret Societies

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 15th] The Guilin Pacification Headquarters and the Provincial Government, in view of the fact that recently some veterans in Pingcheng and other counties have secretly formed societies in the form of gatherings, attempting to engage in political activities, which are detrimental to public security, have jointly issued an order to strictly prohibit them. At the same time, the Guilin Pacification Headquarters also notified all officials and civilians in the province to invigorate their spirits, rectify discipline, assist the government, eliminate traitors, and stabilize the locality, in order to change the atmosphere and jointly overcome the difficulties.

### The True Face of Peace in Beiping (Continued from Yesterday)

(4) The Fierce Battle of Tianjin

After Beiping was besieged, the Communist Party launched a "probing attack" on Tianjin. Although the national army's forces gathered in Tianjin were only two armies, their combat effectiveness was very strong. However, because the disparity in numbers was too great, the defense circle became smaller and smaller. The most intense days of fighting were January 12, 13, and 14. According to friends who went from Tianjin to Beiping afterwards, from the afternoon of the 12th, the sound of artillery was even denser than the sound of machine guns. The deafening sound was like thunder in summer, continuously ringing into one piece. The four words "ceaseless rumbling" are not enough to describe it. This fierce battle lasted until dawn on the 15th. Tianjin had no city walls. The national army was just holding on to the trenches and fighting bitterly. Afterwards, military friends in Beiping criticized the national army who defended Tianjin as being truly strong, and the communist army who attacked were also truly brave. In total, the Communist Party itself admitted to more than 50,000 casualties in this battle, and the actual number must have been even higher. In the end, the communist army broke in through Xiyingmen. At that time, the trenches there were already filled with communist corpses who had been killed while charging forward. The attackers were able to step over the corpses and pass through. Thus, Tianjin fell, but please relax, Tianjin's compatriots, although the offensive and defensive battles in Tianjin were so fierce, the destruction in the city was not too tragic. First of all, for ordinary citizens, according to newspaper reports, the front line statistics showed that the number of deaths and injuries was at most four or five hundred. Secondly, for buildings, those destroyed by artillery fire were only Dongjuzi, Xiyingmen, Zhao Jia Street in the southwest corner of the city, the Zhengzhong Bookstore in the former Japanese Concession, the Zhihua Church area, the Wuzhou Pharmacy area in the old French Concession, Sanma Road in Hedong, and the area near the North Station. The rest were largely intact. After the communist army entered the city, the first measure was to change Zhongzheng Road to Liberation Road, and invite the key figures into the "VIP Camp". It is said that Du Jianshi had disguised himself on the night of the 13th and hid in the US Consulate in Lihua Building, because his personal attendant was a member of the Communist Party. After the communist army entered the city, he informed on him, so he was arrested on the 19th. Garrison Commander Chen Changjie, until the communist army broke in, was still wearing a cape and his left arm was covered with medals. He sat firmly in his office chair at the Garrison Headquarters, directing military affairs by telephone. The communist army, angered by the large number of people who died under his command, hated him to the bone, so he was locked up in the Garrison Headquarters with Lin Weijun and other top war criminals. Liang Ziqing, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, who was also Chairman of the Municipal Party Committee, was hailed as a special agent chief. The newspaper announced that he would await the People's Public Military, but his location was unknown. Yang Yizhou, Speaker of the Municipal Council, who worked hardest for the local peace in Tianjin, was also taken into the "VIP Hotel". As for the captured national army officers and soldiers, they were handled in the following ways: (1) All officers were sent to the Northeast for training. After they were deemed to have changed their thinking, they would be given a national citizenship order for comparison. (2) Old, weak, and disabled soldiers were given a certain amount of travel expenses depending on the distance, and a certificate was issued, allowing them to pass through the communist-controlled areas and take the train back to their hometown. (3) Young and strong soldiers were incorporated into the Liberation Army to replenish casualties during combat and were absolutely not allowed to return to their hometowns. After Tianjin fell, all 19 large and small newspapers in the city were closed down. The Military Control Commission took over the Tianjin Minguo Daily, and Mao Zedong awkwardly inscribed the title, publishing a Tianjin Daily, whose content and style were the same as other communist party newspapers. It only focused on proclamations and propaganda, not on news, but because it had good innate conditions, it was printed very carefully, with many pictures and photos. It was published daily on a large sheet of paper, and on Saturdays, it was published on two large sheets of paper, which was much more impressive than the Xinhua Daily published in Chongqing during the Anti-Japanese War. All the others were dead and buried. Only the Tianjin Yishi Daily, until the Communist Party shouted "Freedom of Religion" to the skies and had a relationship with the Roman Catholic Church, was repeatedly asked to be re-published, but it was never considered. The Tianjin Dagong Daily was generally believed to have an impartial attitude in its comments, and was somewhat left-leaning, especially since Fan Changjiang, who was so popular in the communist news circles, came from the newspaper. Now, Xu Ying and Peng Tiangang, who are stationed in Beiping, are also relatives of the Communist Party and have also used various methods to campaign for re-publication, but the result is still zero. Later, the Tianjin Military Control Commission renamed it the Progress Daily, but it is not known for sure. The Xinhua News Agency broadcasted and severely criticized the Dagong Daily for its history of being a running dog of warlords and the Political Science Department. Other measures were roughly the same as in Beiping, which will be described later. As for Tanggu, it is well known that two days after Tianjin fell, the defending soldiers boarded warships and retreated with the entire army, which I will not repeat here. The current chairman of the Tianjin Pseudo Military Control Commission is Huang Kecheng, the Pseudo Mayor is Huang Jing, and the Pseudo Deputy Mayor is Zhang Youyu.

(5) Beiping's Brewing

The brewing of peace in Beiping can be divided into two aspects: the social aspect and the military aspect. I will quote them below:

As for the brewing of peace in the social sphere, if we proceed in chronological order, Zhang Yinwu should be considered the first to advocate it. At the beginning of the siege, when no one dared to publicly advocate peace, he made a stunning statement in the Liaison Association of National Representatives of the 29 Provinces and Cities in North China, publishing his high opinion that peace must be sought immediately. At that time, the dispute was very intense, and some of the representatives who attended the meeting slammed the table and withdrew. This scene was published in newspapers in various places in mid-December of the 37th year, so I will not repeat it. Since then, he has continued to work hard, attending every meeting and advocating peace whenever possible. I think anyone who writes a local history of peace in Beiping will have to write the name of Mr. Zhang on the first page. The second is Xu Huidong, Speaker of the Beiping Municipal Council. Around the siege, he also contacted the responsible persons of the council in the six units of Hebei, Jin, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Tianjin to form a Joint Association of Councils of Seven Provinces and Cities. Not long after the siege, he responded to the methods of Zhang Yinwu and others, frequently convening peace movement meetings of all sectors in the Municipal Council. His diligence in running around is known to everyone. Details can be found in the Beiping newspapers during the siege. There is no need to elaborate. The person who finally knocked on the door to peace was He Siyuan. Mr. He was originally the mayor of Beiping. After handing over his post, he became an honorary citizen of Beiping. At the beginning of the siege, he seemed to be still in Shanghai. The date of his return to Beiping was probably one or two days before my return to Beiping. After getting off the plane, he told reporters that he came specifically to work for peace. Therefore, he spent his days going in and out of Zhongnanhai and shuttling between the Municipal Council. Finally, he led ten representatives out of the city, covered in dust and exhausted. Later, his residence at No. 9 Xila Hu Alley was hit by several shells. His daughter, He Baozai, died, his wife was injured, and he himself was injured in the arm. Regarding the brewing of peace, from the beginning of the twelfth lunar month to mid-January, after the efforts of Zhang, Xu, and He, it finally matured. When humanity reaches its most dangerous moment, its instinct is to seek survival first. As for the way of life after survival, that is the question. Therefore, at this time, there was no one who sang the opposite tune. The ten peace representatives seemed to leave the city on the 17th (the date is not too clear). The composition of the representatives was He Siyuan as the leader. The rest seemed to include Legislator Lu Fu, Chenghui representative Guo Shutang, Chamber of Commerce representative Liu Hongrui, Women's representative Kang Tongbi, etc. On the evening of the 16th, they first contacted the Communist Party by radio, agreeing to go to Haidian from Xizhimen at 9:00 AM the next morning to meet with Ye Jianying. Very early on the 17th, the ten representatives gathered at the Municipal Council. Because Mr. Fu hesitated and delayed until 3:00 PM before departing, the ten of them sat in a large car with a large white flag in front of the car with the words "North China People's Peace Delegation" written on it, carrying these ten representatives who were holding their breath, cautiously out of Liangzhimen. When they were about to reach Wanshengyuan, they were stopped by gunshots, and two soldiers without cap badges came up to question them and accused them of being late. Then, they got into the car and guided them to the west. When they passed Wanshengyuan North and turned to Baishiqiao, there were random gunshots in front of them. The guide stood outside the car and shouted, "Comrades, don't shoot. They have surrendered." After that, they went north smoothly and were no longer hindered. After arriving at Haidian, the ten representatives were hosted in the Xie residence in Donghoutou. The house was very spacious. Ye Jianying did not meet them. It is said that Ye waited all morning but did not see them, and went to Tianjin on urgent business. A Mr. Huang met them on his behalf. Mr. Huang was very proud of being a victor. During the conversation, when the representatives mentioned the Central Government, he pretended not to understand and insisted on calling it the Pseudo Central Government. When talking about the term President, he pretended not to know and insisted on calling him Chiang Kai-shek. (To Be Continued)

### The National Army Receives Orders for Strategic Retreat, Wuhan Becomes a Vacuum, The Central China Command Headquarters Moves to Hengyang and Changsha to Establish a Command Post, Bai Chongxi Flies to Chang Yesterday by Plane

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 15th] The Wuhan National Army received orders on the 15th for a strategic retreat. Garrison Commander Lu Shiyuan issued a written statement at 7:00 PM, saying: "My headquarters was ordered to garrison Wuhan. For the past two months, we have received assistance from the local elders, and the results have been satisfactory. We are immensely grateful. All attacks by the bandit army have been repelled. Now, my headquarters has received orders for a strategic retreat, abandoning Wuhan. As we are about to depart, we are filled with reluctance. In the future, local security will be the responsibility of the police and the people's self-defense corps. We hope everyone will maintain their livelihoods and not be alarmed." Currently, the 58th Army and the Garrison Headquarters responsible for garrisoning Wuhan have completed their withdrawal. The entire city has become a vacuum. Protection groups, fire brigades, and the police are maintaining security. The city is still calm, and all newspapers are still publishing as usual.

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 15th] It is reported that the entire Central China Command Headquarters has moved to Hengyang and established a command post in Changsha. Commander Bai Chongxi will be stationed there permanently to preside over matters. The new building of the Hunan Provincial Assembly has been selected as the office address. Bai arrived in Chang today and immediately announced its formal establishment.

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 15th] Bai Chongxi, the Chief of Military and Political Affairs of Central China, arrived in Changsha at 1:20 PM today on the Zhuiyun special plane from Han. Xia Wei, Yang Aiqiong, and others accompanied him. Cheng Qian, Zhu Dingqing, Zhang Gan, Chen Mingren, Tang Shengzhi, and more than twenty others greeted him at the airport.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th] The Southern Section Command Post of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Protection Command has decided to establish a command post in Guangzhou, with General Qiu Shiying concurrently serving as the director of the command post. He will be responsible for the protection of the southern section, the Guangzhou-Kowloon, and Guangzhou-Sanshui railways. Qiu has been consulting with the Director of the Pacification Headquarters, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, and the heads of relevant departments for several days to establish the command post and is actively carrying out security work along the railway lines.

### Yan Xishan and Others Initiate Anti-Communist and National Salvation Movement, Scheduled to Establish an Anti-Aggression Organization

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th] After the Communist army crossed the Yangtze River, their arrogance has become increasingly rampant. People from all walks of life in Guangzhou believe that anti-communism and national salvation are the most urgent tasks at present. This work is not simply the responsibility of the government or a particular party, but is something that all citizens should strive for. Therefore, at 4:00 PM on the 15th, Yan Xishan, Zou Lu, Li Wenfan, Wu Tiecheng, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Lifu, Ma Chaojun, Chen Qitian, Yu Jiaju, Jiang Yuntian, Wan Hongtu, Xia Sheng, and others initiated a tea party at the German Scholars Association on Wende Road to discuss how to carry out anti-communist work. More than fifty people attended the meeting, and Yan Xishan was elected as the chairman. He reported on the significance of the meeting, stating that since the peace talks broke down, the Communist Party has actively attacked Central China, which proves their ambition to communize China and East Asia. Under these circumstances, the Chinese people must strengthen their unity and unite with the people of East Asian countries to form an anti-aggression front to give the Communist Party a powerful blow and shatter their aggressive attempts. All parties, factions, and non-partisan individuals in the country should first have an anti-aggression organization and then an anti-aggression movement. With an organized and powerful approach, they should unite with anti-aggression countries around the world to stop the Communist Party's aggressive actions. If this view is considered necessary, an anti-aggression organization can be initiated to jointly seek progress. Then, Chen Qitian, Wan Wutu, Qian Cheng, Yu Jiayao, Zhang Qiyun, Chen Kezhong, Zhang Daofan, Yu Lingyun, Chi Zheng, Xiao Zheng, Huang Zhong, and others spoke, generally agreeing that an anti-communist organization and movement are urgently needed at present and should be established as soon as possible. Close contact should be established with international anti-aggression and pro-freedom individuals to achieve national independence, political democracy, economic equality, and freedom of life, and to jointly ensure world peace. Finally, the following points were decided: 1. All those who participated in today's meeting are initiators. 2. For the organization and program, Yan Xishan, Chen Qitian, Ma Chaojun, Wan Hongtu, Zhang Qiyun, Qian Zhong, Cheng Tianfang, Gu Zhengding, Yuan Qian, Gao Xin, Yang Gongda, Jiang Yuntian, Wang Shihui, and other thirteen people are designated to draft the organization's name, program, and charter, which will be convened by Yan Xishan. 3. The second meeting of the initiators will be held at 4:00 PM on the 19th to decide on the name and program. The founding assembly will be held on the 22nd. After the program is determined, a declaration will be issued to actively promote anti-communist and national salvation work.

[United Press, Guangzhou, 15th] Yan Xishan replied to foreign reporters today, saying that President Chiang has not been invited to Guangzhou to lead the government or the Kuomintang. The Central Committee of the Kuomintang has not made any decision on this matter. I have also not been invited to take any position in the government, and I have never considered this matter.

### Meticulous Deployment in Northern Fujian, Communication Restored Between Nanping and Fuzhou

[This Newspaper, Fuzhou, 15th] Zhu Shaoliang and Huang Zhenwu went to Gutian yesterday to make arrangements and returned to Rong on the same day. They immediately presided over an important meeting of the Pacification Headquarters and made decisions regarding the stability of the situation in northern Fujian. A spokesman for the Rong Martial Law Headquarters declared: The National Army has made arrangements, and the security of Rong City is not a concern. He hopes that citizens will remain calm and not believe rumors, lest they disrupt their own plans. According to a person who came from Gutian on the 14th, there is a large army stationed there, and the county government is busy day and night supplying the military, but the discipline of the stationed troops is quite good, and everything is very normal. The person came to Rong via the valley mouth, changing to the Jianxi waterway. The situation at the valley mouth is also stable. As for the situation north of Jian'ou, it is not as serious as the rumors here suggest. Furthermore, the telegraph service in Nanping was restored in the afternoon of the 15th, and the National Army has regained control of the area. The authorities believe that the lack of communication about the situation in northern Fujian has caused unrest in the rear. The Pacification Headquarters has dispatched several wireless communication teams to send accurate information from various locations to avoid the spread of rumors and prevent them from shaking people's hearts.

### Refugee Students Sign Up for the Army

Sun Liren Expresses Welcome

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th] High school and college students in the war zone, having witnessed the cruelty of the Communist bandits and unable to bear their trampling, have sought refuge together in order to fight for a "free way of life." After arriving in Guangzhou, although the Ministry of Education introduced them to schools for enrollment, they could not concentrate on their studies due to the turbulent situation. They have petitioned the Ministry of Education to join the army. Minister Hang telegraphed Sun Liren, the Commander-in-Chief of Army Training, who replied in a telegram: "We welcome young people who can endure hardship, are hard-working, and have patriotic enthusiasm to join the army." The students were very excited about this news, and more than 300 have already signed up. High school and college students who have sought refuge in Guangzhou individually and have not yet enrolled in school are also enthusiastically participating and are currently signing up and registering. They will be sent to the Guangzhou Youth Guidance Center for collective registration procedures. It is learned that the Guidance Center has decided to cooperate with the Army Training Command's Recruit Regiment in Guangzhou starting on the 16th to recruit personnel. Registration will be conducted at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. It is reported that almost all of the more than 500 refugee students currently residing at the Second Temporary Reception Station of the Henan Wufeng Prefecture Education Department's Youth Guidance Association have signed up for the army. The Youth Guidance Association has agreed to lend the reception station to the Army Training Department's Recruit Regiment as a temporary shelter. The students residing at the station will soon be issued clothing and food by the Recruit Regiment, and they are scheduled to take a special ship to Taiwan in the shortest possible time.

### Ministry of Education Formulates Measures to Settle Refugee Students

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th] On the settlement of refugee students, Ministry of Education spokesman Zhan Jiewu told reporters: The Ministry is actively handling the settlement of refugee students and has established temporary reception stations to accommodate students from various places in Guangzhou. The Ministry's Guidance Association has sent staff to manage the stations, take attendance, and issue temporary relief funds for verification. As for the settlement of the students after they arrive in Guangzhou, measures have also been formulated. Regarding high school students: (1) Those who volunteer to join the army have been discussed with the Army Headquarters Training Department, and the Guidance Association will cooperate with the Department's Guangzhou Recruitment Office to handle the students' registration. After registration, they will be sent to Taiwan for training. (2) Student training camps will be held. This matter is currently being discussed with the Ministry of National Defense. (3) Those who volunteer to continue their studies will be distributed as much as possible to the Zhongshan County Provisional High School and public and private schools in the rear. Regarding university and college students: (1) Those who wish to continue their studies will be entrusted to appropriate colleges and universities for enrollment. (2) Those who wish to join the army will be sent to Taiwan for military training. Fourth-year students who are about to graduate and must go to Taiwan for military training in the near future and cannot report to the entrusted colleges and universities for enrollment will submit proof documents after completing and passing military training, and the Ministry will issue graduation certificates after verification. Zhan continued: Currently, the population of Guangzhou is crowded, and prices are high. The Ministry of Education has notified the reception stations to move to the southwest provinces in the rear and should no longer concentrate in Guangzhou to avoid difficulties with food and lodging.

### Hong Kong People Somewhat Reassured, Stock Prices Rebound

Most Exporters to North China Lose Money

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 15th] After the British authorities expressed their determination to defend Hong Kong, the people of Hong Kong were somewhat reassured, and property and stock prices rebounded. Property in prosperous commercial areas rose by 60% compared to the past two weeks, while residential areas rose by 10%. The stock market, which had been sluggish for a week due to public apathy, suddenly became prosperous over the weekend. All stocks rebounded from their lows. Public utility stocks saw the most transactions. The stock transaction statistics for the past week were 1,211,999 shares, with a market value of more than 2.6 million yuan. Due to the large-scale return of Hong Kong dollars and the stagnation of exports, general commerce in Hong Kong has been sluggish. Although trade with North China has resumed, exporters have mostly reported losses due to various restrictions. Although the Hong Kong market is sluggish, commodity prices remain high. Grain prices have risen sharply due to difficult sources and population growth. The wholesale price of rice on the free market is 84 yuan per dan. Meat prices have also risen by about 30% compared to the previous month. Gold prices remain high, but diamond prices have increased by 30% since the end of last year.

### U.S. Halts Japanese Reparations Program, Ambassador Gu Will Issue Statement, Personnel of Delegation to Japan Will Be Reduced

[Associated Press, New York, 14th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun said on the 14th that the Chinese representative to the Far Eastern Commission will discuss the recently announced U.S. policy on Japanese reparations at the Commission's next meeting. Gu said that he has not yet discussed this issue with the representative, but he will discuss it with them on the 14th. He may issue a statement on the 15th.

[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] If the U.S. plan to stop shipping Japanese reparations goods is quickly adopted by the Far Eastern Commission, the Japanese treasury will save about 2,660,000,000 yen in factory maintenance costs for reparations. The chairman of the Japanese Reparations Committee said that a plan will be drafted soon to restore production in idle factories and revive the Japanese economy.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] Zhu Shiming, head of the Chinese delegation to Japan, announced that one-third of the delegation's 106 personnel will be laid off in the next two weeks. Zhu said that this is being done under orders from the government.

### Editorial: The Rise of Street Stalls and Industry and Commerce

In the past few days, the streets have been lined with street stalls, one after another. Several normally quiet streets are also noisy with people; busy areas are even more crowded. The desolate cityscape is adorned with a distorted prosperity. The goods sold at the street stalls are mostly daily necessities; and the owners of the street stalls are mostly junior employees of industry and commerce. At first glance, it is indeed very lively, but there are many onlookers and few buyers; despite the cheap prices and good quality, there are always very few who inquire, which fully shows that the decline of industry and commerce in Shanghai is on the verge of bankruptcy.

Since the breakdown of peace talks and the resumption of war, the economic situation in Shanghai has also deteriorated with the dramatic changes in the military situation. Due to the war, maritime transport on the northern and Yangtze River lines has also been suspended, resulting in general American products having no way to be exported, and stocks piling up like mountains, and funds cannot be circulated, and so it has fallen into a state of stagnation. At the same time, due to the decline in purchasing power of the general public, shops are deserted, and some do not even have a single transaction in a day. Under these circumstances, it is of course difficult for industry and commerce to maintain, but to close down, they do not have the ability to dismiss employees. So, they distribute unsold goods to employees as severance pay. In order to maintain their daily lives, the employees are eager to turn the goods they receive into cash, and this primitive-era market-style street stall emerges.

The operation of street stalls will affect legitimate shops, and for industry and commerce, it is "adding fuel to the fire." At the same time, the operation of shops must be registered with the competent authorities and must pay taxes. Setting up a street stall does not require these procedures, which will affect tax revenue. However, this type of stall is different from past stalls. Due to the difficulties faced by industry and commerce, they cannot maintain, and have no choice but to distribute the manufactured goods to employees, who then turn them into cash to maintain their livelihoods. This is the last batch of rewards earned with labor and sweat, temporarily used to get through the current days. After they are sold out and eaten up, how will they live? It is impossible to imagine. This kind of situation, this kind of struggle, is truly pitiful, and of course it cannot be summarily banned.

However, stalls are set up every five steps on important traffic routes, and gatherings every ten steps, everywhere is crowded with people. This makes pedestrians feel extremely difficult, with a feeling of "cannot move," so the municipal authorities have to come forward to intervene, limiting the areas where street vendors can operate, stipulating the following eleven places: (1) Beijing Road; (2) Nanjing Road; (3) Fuzhou Road; (4) East Zhongzheng Road; (5) Jinling Road; (6) East Linsen Road; (7) The Bund from Waibaidu Bridge to the 16th Pier; (8) Sichuan Road; (9) Jiangxi Road; (10) Fujian Road; (11) Zhejiang Road, where street stalls are not allowed to operate. This is a helpless measure, and street vendors should of course comply.

However, designating areas for street vendors to operate is only a temporary expedient measure. But how long can this distorted liveliness last? After the vendors have sold out and eaten up their goods, how will their lives be arranged? Is Shanghai's industry and commerce really allowed to go to a dead end? Are these millions of employees who rely on it to maintain their livelihoods allowed to fall into unemployment? Rescuing the current crisis in industry and commerce is a matter of utmost urgency. The main thing is to channel the output of industrial products so that funds can be circulated, manufacturers can maintain, and employees can be spared unemployment. This certainly requires the government's earnest support, as well as the assistance of relevant agencies, to overcome the current difficulties.

In fact, this kind of difficult encounter is not only for Shanghai's industry and commerce, but for the general public, it is even more unbearable. Just look at the goods on the street stalls, which are so cheap that they can't be any cheaper, but there are still very few buyers. In short, the rise of street stalls is the most serious social problem at present. For industry and commerce, it can be described as "drinking poison to quench thirst," which is harmful and useless to legitimate industry and commerce; for society, it is an even more serious problem, showing that Shanghai society has reached an extremely serious stage!

### From Haiyan to Shanghai

— Oasis

After Hangzhou was lost, the author accompanied his elderly mother and a dozen other refugees who had fled at the same time on a boat to Haiyan, arriving after four days.

With a feeling of wandering, I went ashore and learned that there were no National Army troops stationed in the four suburbs of Meiyan. At the time of the fierce fighting in Anji and Xiaofeng, it was already in a vacuum state, with no National Army and no Communist Army. The market was maintained by a small number of locally organized "Baojia Joint Teams," and there were very few robbery cases. The streets were unusually desolate, and gold yuan notes had disappeared. Citizens used silver dollars and copper coins as the currency of exchange. Only three or four newspapers had suspended publication, leaving only one four-page Haiyan local newspaper.

After dawn on May 5, the weather turned overcast, and it began to drizzle around 9:00 AM. I inquired and learned that there were wheelbarrows that could go to Yangjiao Town, about fifty li from Pinghu. I accompanied my elderly mother with five yuan in silver dollars, plus a gold ear pick weighing eight or nine fen, to hire a cart to the town, traveling along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. Along the way, the wheels rumbled, and the misty rain over the fields was a unique experience.

At 2:30 PM, the cart arrived at Liucun. The carter and I went into the village to find a shop to have lunch. When we entered the village, we suddenly encountered four local communists of unknown number, who stopped the cart to check us. One of them stepped forward to snatch my handbag and opened it to see a geography book printed with the national flag, which he immediately tore up and asked in the Jiangsu dialect where I came from. After I repeatedly explained and showed my Hangzhou ID card and documents, he allowed us to enter the village. After entering the village, I saw two small mountain cannons parked on the small street in the village, and I realized that the Communist army had occupied the village. The situation in the village was very bleak, with only a few villagers helping the Communist army to move things.

After lunch, we went back on the road. About two li from the village, we encountered another small squad of Communist army sentries, about twelve or thirteen people. After seeing me, they only asked a few questions and let us go.

We arrived at Yangjiao Town in the evening. There was no Communist army in the town. That night, the rain stopped and the moon came out. We stayed overnight in a very small inn. The next day, the weather turned sunny and the temperature was very hot. So I hired another two-wheeled ox cart to set off for Pinghu. The ox moved very slowly, and the highway was destroyed all the way, so we had to take a small detour. However, the situation was still stable. We arrived in Pinghu at about 3:00 PM. Pinghu was not occupied by the Communist army, but the market was very chaotic. No one was interested in the silver dollars in our hands. Rice prices plummeted, and most of the shops were closed. Only a few self-defense teams and security police maintained order on the streets. I heard that there would be an early bus to Songjiang the next morning, so I accompanied my mother to spend the night at the station.

At 6:00 AM on the 7th, seven buses in a row arrived in Songjiang, but the crowded situation was rare. After repeatedly discussing with the driver and promising to pay four extra silver dollars as a reward, he allowed my elderly mother to sit next to the driver. The bus only set off at 9:00 AM. It was stopped and searched by military police along the way to Fengxian, Zhelu, Tinglin, and Jinshan. It was delayed until late before arriving in Songjiang. As soon as we got off the bus, we heard that Pinghu was lost, and the passengers in the same car all expressed their good fortune.

On the morning of the 8th, we took the train to Shanghai. The train stopped at Longhua and did not proceed. After inquiring, we found out that it was another military police inspection. This inspection was very strict. Those without Shanghai resident ID cards were not allowed to get off the train. I was also not exempt. Later, after I showed my documents and called a friend in a Shanghai newspaper, Mr. Qian, to vouch for me, I was allowed to get off the train. Then, I took a car to Shanghai.

### Diplomatic Personnel From a Certain Country Talk About Sino-Soviet Relations, Saying That There Is Definite Evidence That the Soviet Union Is Aiding the Chinese Communists

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th] The Central Daily News here today published a New York dispatch from the 6th, saying that it is rumored in New York that the British delegation to the United Nations has obtained sufficient evidence of Soviet assistance to the Chinese Communist Party. This would allow China to accuse the Soviet Union at the United Nations and make the world understand that China's anti-communist war is not a civil war within one country, but an international war. After this news was disclosed, the Chinese delegation was instructed by the government to inquire with the British delegation about the truth. Reporters from various news agencies also actively moved around, probing the contents. However, for some diplomatic reasons, the British delegation has not been willing to announce it publicly, and even in response to inquiries from the Chinese representative country, they only replied with vague and general terms, because the time for announcement is not yet ripe, so they have to adopt this attitude. I have quite a bit of contact with diplomatic personnel from a certain country here. The other day, after a cocktail party, this diplomatic personnel and Gao Cailie talked a lot about the Sino-Soviet relationship. I learned from his mouth that the evidence obtained by the British delegation includes secret documents or photos regarding the following matters: (1) In September 1945, at the request of the Chinese Communist Party, the Soviet Union refused to allow Chinese troops to land in Dalian and Lushun to take over the Northeast. (2) According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, the Soviet Union should have withdrawn all Soviet troops occupying the Northeast before December 3, 1945, but in order to facilitate the transfer of the Northeast to the Chinese Communist Party, the Soviet Union delayed its withdrawal until May 1946. (3) The Soviet Union obtained weapons from the 700,000-strong Japanese Kwantung Army in the Northeast. In addition to shipping heavy artillery and large tanks to the Soviet Union, the remaining weapons, such as rifles, machine guns, mortars, and small tanks, were all handed over to the Chinese Communist Party. As a result, the Chinese Communist Party's unarmed soldiers entered the Northeast from North China and immediately acquired equipment, becoming a strong fighting force. (4) In 1946, when the Soviet Union sent Li Lisan back to China, it sent several senior military officers to Harbin to serve as military advisors to Lin Biao. Since then, all operational plans against the National Army have been formulated by Soviet advisors. (5) After 1946, the Chinese Communist troops in Shandong continued to obtain replenishment of weapons and ammunition from Dalian and Lushun to fight against the National Army. (6) After the Chinese Communist Party seized heavy artillery from the National Army, no one could use it, so the Soviet Union sent artillery officers to China to command. (7) After the Chinese Communist Party occupied the Northeast, it signed a secret agreement with the Soviet Union to supply the Soviet Union with steel and soybeans produced in the Northeast for a period of ten years. (8) Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia, unable to bear the oppression of the Soviet Union, rose up in resistance, seeking to win independence for the country. Moscow immediately ordered all communist parties around the world to condemn Tito, and the Chinese Communist Party also followed orders meticulously. (9) This year, in March, under the supervision of the Soviet Union, representatives of the Chinese Communist Party and the Korean Communist Party signed a mutual assistance secret agreement in Moscow. The Chinese Communist Party immediately obtained military assistance from the Korean Communist Party through this secret agreement. (10) Recently, twelve countries including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy signed the North Atlantic Security Treaty to resist the Soviet Union's aggressive policy. The Soviet Union was very afraid and ordered all communist parties around the world to issue statements attacking the North Atlantic Treaty and claiming that they would unanimously defend the Soviet Union and resist the United Kingdom and the United States. After receiving the order, Mao Zedong issued a broadcast speech on April 4, claiming that the Chinese Communist Party would lead the Chinese people to fight for the Soviet Union. The above ten points are all well-founded facts that can prove that the Chinese Communist Party is secretly colluding with the Soviet Union to carry out its true intention of seizing Chinese power.

### Restoring Trade Relations Between East and West Germany: The Four Powers Have Reached an Agreement; The First Cargo Ship from Hamburg Sails to Berlin

[United Press Berlin, 14th] Wilkinson, the Economic Advisor to the US Military Government, announced today that the four powers, the US, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, have almost completely reached an agreement on the restoration of trade between East and West Germany. The entire agreement is expected to be finalized by next Wednesday. From then on, commerce between the four occupation zones in Germany can begin to advance rapidly. Although the blockade has been lifted, the volume of trade is still limited. The three-day meeting of the four powers' economic advisors ended today. According to Wilkinson's statement, excellent progress has been made at the meeting. The Soviet Union intends to restore the old agreement on trade between East and West Germany, which was suspended during the Berlin blockade in June last year. Western countries believe that it is no longer applicable because it violates the current supply and demand situation and is based on a single Mark currency system for all of Germany. Since the joint use of East and West Marks, there has been no satisfactory exchange plan. Wilkinson also stated that the entire agreement could be signed next Wednesday. This is the first four-power meeting held in Berlin since last spring.

[United Press New York, 15th] The "New York Times" today carried a report from Frankfurt stating that the Soviet Union has assured the US Military Government that it will immediately resume the shipment of wheat, timber, and similar goods from the Soviet zone of Germany to the 18 countries of the Allied Reparations Agency, to fulfill the Paris Reparations Treaty and the Potsdam Agreement. The Soviet side made this proposal at a meeting with officials of the US Military Government and was immediately accepted. The Soviet proposal was sudden, and did not mention that the United States should also resume shipping reparations goods from West Germany. The Soviet representative clearly wanted to conduct negotiations in an atmosphere of complete agreement.

[Reuters Herlenburg, British Zone, 14th] After the lifting of the blockade, the first river cargo ship "Anna" from Hamburg arrived here tonight and is en route to Berlin. According to the captain, he did not feel troubled by the Soviet inspection and hoped that the Soviet officials could quickly inspect the cargo on board. He expects the ship to arrive in Berlin on Monday afternoon. The Soviet inspection station is located in Wittenberg, twelve miles from here.

### Reviewing Joint Strategies on the German Question: Satisfactory Consultations Among the Three Countries; Austria Requests the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference to Discuss the Austrian Treaty

[United Press Paris, 15th] Representatives of the US, Britain, and France held a secret meeting at the French Foreign Ministry for two and a half hours yesterday to discuss a unified strategy for the three countries at the upcoming Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. After the meeting, the representatives remained tight-lipped about the contents of the meeting. The meeting will continue on the 16th. Those present today included the British Deputy Foreign Secretary, Mr. Coulbert, US Envoy Jessup, and French Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Barraudy, as well as experts on German issues from the three countries.

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 14th] French diplomatic sources expressed satisfaction with the progress of the three-country talks. They hinted that the talks were only exploratory in nature and that discussions on various issues would begin next week. The US proposal to withdraw occupation troops has been rejected again, but diplomatic sources said that this does not mean that the Western countries will put forward active and concrete proposals at the beginning of the talks.

[Agence France-Presse London, 14th] British authorities today denied a report in the "Evening Star" that Deputy Foreign Secretary Coulbert had carried a detailed plan to solve the German question when he went to Paris to attend the preparatory meeting on Germany. The evening paper also said that this plan was drafted by Foreign Secretary Bevin. Well-informed sources said that Coulbert did not receive any firm instructions for the three-country preparatory meeting. Foreign Secretary Bevin will also not have a firm plan when he goes to Paris in the future. Some quarters said that when Bevin was in Germany last week, he published the opinions of German political leaders, who reportedly asked the Western occupation forces not to withdraw from Germany before the new government established by the Bonn Constitutional Assembly can cope with any political demonstrations supported by force.

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 15th] A spokesperson for the Austrian Embassy in Paris expressed satisfaction with the results of Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber's meeting with representatives from the US, Britain, and France yesterday, saying that "the Western countries were very understanding of the opinions put forward by the Austrian representatives." Gruber requested in yesterday's meeting that the Western representatives include the Austrian treaty issue on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. He will leave here for Vienna tonight, but will return here when the Foreign Ministers' Conference is convened.

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 14th] The new US Ambassador to France, Bruce, arrived here today from Washington. The ambassador told reporters that he did not know whether he would be a member of the US delegation to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference.

### East German Elections: Policy Platform Published

[Reuters Berlin, 15th] The German People's Congress began its election today and is scheduled to hold the election on the 16th. The 12 million voters in the entire Soviet zone only need to vote yes or no on the list of candidates. After the People's Congress is produced, it will discuss and approve the constitution drafted by the German People's Committee. The political platform published by the People's Congress calls for German unification, an early conclusion of a peace treaty, the withdrawal of all occupation troops, and the unification of the German currency system.

### Cargo Transportation in Austria: The Soviet Union Relaxes Controls

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 14th] The Soviet authorities have decided to relax cargo transportation controls at the borders of the Soviet occupation zone in Austria from May 25th. Coal, oil, timber, certain metals, and fodder will be deregulated in the future, but grain, scrap iron, and manufactured goods still require permits. The Soviet High Commissioner in Austria has formally notified Austrian Chancellor Figl of this decision today.

### McCloy Has Agreed to Serve as US High Commissioner to Germany

[Agence France-Presse New York, 14th] According to the Daily News, International Bank Chairman McCloy has accepted the position of US High Commissioner to Germany and will also serve as the head of the ECA branch in Germany. Truman will announce McCloy's appointment in the coming days.

### Italian Government Orders Ban on Political Collective Marches

Fighting Breaks Out During Rome University Elections

[United Press Rome, 14th] The Italian government banned collective political marches in Rome on the 14th, placing new restrictions on the Italian Social Movement, which openly has fascist characteristics. This order aims to suppress neo-fascist propaganda and to deal with the peace conference scheduled to be held here on June 14th by the Communist Party.

[Agence France-Presse Rome, 14th] Today, during the election of representatives of the law department at the University of Rome, there was a heated debate, followed by hundreds of students fighting each other, resulting in seventeen injuries, three of whom were seriously injured. Some students even set up obstacles in the hall to defend themselves during the election.

### UN General Assembly Postpones Closing: Special Voting on the Spanish and Italian-Administered Territory Issues; Compromise Recommendation Adopted for the South African Discrimination Against Indians Case

[United Press New York, 14th] The United Nations General Assembly will not be able to adjourn tonight and will have to heatedly discuss the two issues of Spain and former Italian territories next Monday. Latin American countries have proposed restoring full diplomatic relations with Spain. After this issue is resolved, the Italian colonial issue will be discussed again.

The Indian accusation against South Africa for discrimination against Indians was passed tonight by the representatives with a vote of forty-seven to one (South Africa) and ten abstentions, requesting South Africa, India, and Pakistan to hold a round table conference. This is a compromise action. In the previous two General Assemblies, the representatives had accused South Africa of violating basic human rights in its treatment of Indians. After voting on this case, the President of the General Assembly, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, declared that the General Assembly still had important cases to discuss, and unless there was opposition, the meeting would be extended to Monday morning. The tired representatives applauded in approval. The closing date of the General Assembly depends on whether it can quickly resolve the two issues of Spain and the Italian colonies. There are many people requesting to speak, and it is feared that a vote will not be possible until Tuesday. Latin American countries have proposed fully restoring relations with Spain, and it is doubtful whether this case will pass. Both the supporters and opponents claim that they can win. The distribution and trusteeship of Italian colonies has been voted on by the Political Committee.

### US Loan to Spain to Be Announced Soon

[Reuters London, 15th] The Sunday Times carried a special dispatch from Barcelona stating that, according to reliable diplomatic sources, a US loan to Spain will be announced soon.

### Arabs Demonstrate Against Partition of Libya

[United Press Tripoli, Libya, 15th] Arabs here held a demonstration today to oppose the UN General Assembly's discussion of the partition of the Libyan colony. Several accidents occurred on the spot, and the authorities immediately announced martial law and imposed a curfew.

### French President's Speech

[Agence France-Presse Lyon, 15th] French President Auriole said in a speech here today that international peace, like the unity of a country, must be based on respect for individual and public freedom, respect for the principles of justice between people and nations, and respect for the foundations of each people, its traditions, and its political system. In short, it must unite independent countries to ensure the security, independence, and prosperity of every individual.

### Soviet Exports of Manganese and Chromium Ores to the US Decrease

[United Press Washington, 14th] Soviet exports of the important raw materials manganese and chromium to the US are decreasing, and some people believe that the Soviet Union wants to force the United States to relax restrictions on exports to the Soviet Union. The United States is stockpiling manganese and chromium for wartime use. According to statistics released by the Bureau of Statistics, the value of manganese and chromium imported in March was only 600,000 yuan, a decrease of more than 50% compared with February, and only one-third of the same period in 1948.

### Australian Prime Minister Calls for a Pacific Pact

The American Legion Proposes the Same

[Agence France-Presse Ducan, 15th] Australian Prime Minister Chifley proposed the establishment of a Pacific Pact to the whole of Australia today in order to support the need for the Atlantic Pact to ensure regional security. Chifley said: "To establish a joint defense pact in the Pacific region, Britain, Australia, and New Zealand should first reach an agreement, then the United States should join, plus other countries with territories in the Pacific. As for the plan for this pact, it can be drafted according to the Atlantic Pact."

[United Press Washington, 14th] The American Legion urged the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today to immediately consider the Pacific Treaty, just like the North Atlantic Treaty. According to President Newcomb White at the meeting, the contributions of the Pacific countries to the opposing regional defense system are almost not as great as those of the European countries, but we should recognize that the advancement of a certain aggressive country on the opposite side of the Pacific will ultimately force the United States to fight for freedom again. The United States must adhere to a firm policy to prevent the recurrence of war.

### US 25 Senators Unanimously Approve: Organizing an International Volunteer Army to Prevent Any Armed Attack on Europe

[United Press Washington, 14th] Two new Republican senators recently proposed the establishment of an international volunteer army to help maintain peace in Europe. The two senators are Murtaugh and Hendrickson. Murtaugh and Hendrickson said: This army can alleviate any armed attack on Europe and comply with the Atlantic Pact. Murtaugh visited the State Department to inquire about negotiating the conclusion of an Asian and Near Eastern defense treaty as a supplement to the Atlantic Treaty. The suggestion to establish an international volunteer army was put forward by Cobson in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. According to Cobb: This volunteer army is composed of volunteers from smaller countries and stationed in troubled areas, such as West Germany. The army is controlled by the defense agency organized by the majority of representatives of the Atlantic Treaty countries. Cobb also said that 25 senators have approved his plan so far, and the plan also advocates abolishing the veto power of the United Nations. According to Hendrickson, Cobb's suggestion can make the United Nations and the Atlantic Pact effective tools for maintaining peace. Murtaugh said that he was very interested in Cobb's plan. Murtaugh also proposed other ways to strengthen the Atlantic Pact and the United Nations as follows:

Establish an Asian Pact, including China

(1) Establish an Asian and Near East Pact and connect it with the Atlantic Treaty or other treaties, or expand the foundation of the Atlantic Treaty to include "non-communist countries" such as Spain, the Chinese Nationalist Government, or Israel. (2) Led by the United States, convene a full United Nations conference, including the Soviet Union, to find an agreement to abolish the veto power and control atomic bombs and other weapons of mass destruction. Murtaugh said: This agreement may also be established without the participation of the Soviet Union. Murtaugh's suggestion to expand regional treaties is the same as the views expressed by Wellington Koo, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries' politicians.

Nehru believes the time is not ripe

On the contrary, Indian Prime Minister Nehru believes that the time is not yet ripe to conclude a Pacific Pact with the Atlantic Pact. Nehru believes that the governments and economic conditions of many Eastern countries are unstable, which will eliminate the possibility of signing a united and effective alliance. US officials have not ruled out the possibility of concluding a Pacific Pact in the future with the assistance of the United States, but it is said that they are very skeptical whether the situation will be favorable in the near future. Many US officials agree with Nehru's views. They are unwilling to consider or suggest US participation in any such pact unless there is a sounder basis for the pact. US officials believe that the situation in Asia is very different from that in Europe. In Europe, the signatories to the Atlantic Pact seem to have reached the same stage of government and economic development, and have complementary economies. On the contrary, many Far Eastern countries do not trade with each other, but trade with Western countries. In addition, some Asian countries are still non-autonomous regions under foreign rule. Many US officials believe that this will further complicate the conclusion of regional alliances.

### The US Is Willing to Have Asian Countries Form a Pacific Pact

The US Will Consider Such Assistance

[United Press Washington, 15th] US officials believe that Asian countries must be stimulated without external encouragement and decide for themselves whether they need a Pacific Pact similar to the Atlantic Pact, and whether they can achieve the sound foundation on which the pact is based. If Asian countries can reach an agreement on the necessity of the Pacific Pact, and if they can achieve the initial economic cooperation that the US government considers necessary, then the US government will sympathetically consider any request for "differential assistance". Generally speaking, this is what US officials have told the representatives of various Eastern countries who have requested the United States to join this pact. The most recent person to request the establishment of an Eastern Alliance was Chinese Ambassador Wellington Koo, who suggested this to Secretary of State Acheson on the 11th. Among those who have made the same suggestion are representatives from the Philippines and Australia.

### US Military Aid Plan: The State Department Issues a Booklet Explaining Four Points

[Reuters Washington, 14th] The State Department today issued a booklet entitled "Building Peace, the US Military Aid Program". It stated that US military aid to Western Europe will continue until all threats of a third world war are completely removed. The booklet also pointed out that the 1950 military aid program depends on the decision of the following four points:

(1) Except for Greece, most of the proposed aid is for re-equipment, which can be maintained for many years in peacetime. (2) The increase in the military strength of European recipient countries should be limited by economic recovery. (3) Western Europe's self-sufficiency and increase. (4) The degree to which the threat of war may be removed. The 1950 military aid program is estimated to require 1.13 billion yuan for most countries and 320 million yuan for Greece, Turkey, and other security zones. The president has the power to use the funds expediently to cope with emergencies at any time. There are three types of assistance methods: (1) Small amount of monetary assistance to increase Western Europe's military productivity. (2) Direct supply of weapons and equipment. (3) The United States provides technical and training assistance.

### US Communist Eisler Escapes to Britain and Is Arrested

[Reuters Washington, 14th] Eisler, a German of German descent who was identified by the US House Un-American Activities Committee as "America's Number One" Communist, secretly boarded the Polish mail ship Batory to Britain from the United States. He was arrested by the police on the ship tonight and is now being held in Southampton Prison. He will be interrogated on Monday and then sent to the London court to review the US Department of Justice's request to extradite him. Eisler was sentenced to one year in prison and other penalties in the United States and was released on bail of 23,500 yuan. Unexpectedly, he secretly boarded a ship and fled to Britain, so the State Department requested the British authorities to arrest him when the ship arrived in Britain. The Polish authorities originally intended to protect Eisler from being arrested. After negotiations with the British authorities, they were told that unless Eisler was handed over, the ship would have to wait until 5 pm on Monday to solve the matter. If it could leave Southampton, it would continue to sail to Poland. The Polish authorities had to yield. The Polish Embassy protested to Britain against Eisler's arrest on the grounds that Eisler was on a Polish ship. However, when the British police boarded the ship to carry out the arrest, the captain of the ship and Polish diplomats did not interfere. Only Eisler himself struggled to resist and was eventually taken ashore by four policemen on a small boat. Officials from the Polish Embassy stated that the embassy did not intend to make any statements before contacting Warsaw. Eisler's arrest warrant was issued based on the 1870 Extradition Act and was executed by Scotland Yard Detective Blythe. Also present were US Embassy Counselor Van Reed, US Consul to Southampton Baker, and representatives from the Polish Embassy and Consulate. The group first went to a cabin near the captain's office and brought Eisler, who was sitting alone in the bar, to the cabin. The outside of the room was guarded by police officers, and negotiations were immediately held inside. Panki from the Polish Embassy and Polish Vice Consul Zimlewski negotiated with Blythe for three hours. Then, the two Polish representatives and Blythe went ashore and asked the Polish Embassy and the Ministry of the Interior for instructions. At 6 pm, Blythe obtained the arrest warrant and re-boarded the ship to carry out the arrest.

[United Press San Francisco, 14th] MacArthur's financial advisor Dodge arrived here today aboard the President Wilson, saying that the mission to stabilize the Japanese economy has been successful. Dodge will report to the State Department and believes that it is not necessary to return to Japan. It is said that the work of the delegation based on MacArthur's headquarters' economic stabilization directive of December 10, 1948, has produced the following important results: (1) A balanced budget, which stopped the massive losses of the Japanese government's long-term progressive progression and removed its vicious double taxation.

### UN General Assembly Passes Freedom of Information Convention, Soviet Representative's Fierce Opposition Proves Ineffective

[Reuters, Flushing Meadow, 14th] The United Nations General Assembly today passed the "Freedom of Information Convention." US Representative Grant called it "the first attempt in history to codify the constitution of collecting and transmitting news into international law." The convention stipulates an international right of correction, whereby if a country believes that news published abroad about it is inaccurate, fabricated, or likely to harm its relations with other countries, it may provide correct information to the publishing country for publication. If that country refuses to publish it, it may be submitted to the UN Secretariat's news agency for publication.

The convention contains twenty-three legally binding articles, the main ones guaranteeing freedom of movement for journalists and equal rights to access information, and prohibiting censorship in peacetime, except in matters of national defense.

Soviet Representative Gromyko launched fierce attacks during the debate on the convention in both the General Assembly Committee and the General Assembly itself, accusing it of strengthening the power of Western news monopolies to intensify defamatory propaganda against the Soviet Union and other Slavic countries. He delivered an hour-long speech, stating that the authors of the convention intended to gain opportunities to infiltrate other countries and spread hysteria-inducing news. Only the most prominent warmongers and war profiteers would benefit from the convention. American, British, French, and Italian newspapers have made it their profession to spread lies about the Soviet Union. They hope other countries will open their doors to their representatives masquerading as journalists, who will collect all kinds of information for the use of American and British intelligence agencies. This convention does not strengthen anti-fascism or prohibit war defeat propaganda, but instead gives free rein to the "Pulitzer" and "Forrestal" groups.

### American Political Parties and Politics

— by Nevins

Although the history of American political parties is as old as the American government itself, the existence of vast national, state, and local organizations of parties, with local, state, and national conventions as the hubs of their activities, began with President Jackson's second term (1829-37). Fully developed party activity, especially the two-party system, is only about a hundred years old in the American context.

Do political parties have a healthy function? Some major leaders in Washington's time did not think so. They believed that parties only served to cause division and create disagreement. Good citizens of the new republic should reject parties. This view originated from a sound Roman spirit. This view was later expressed in Macaulay's poem: "Then none was for a party; Then all were for the state." Washington's unanimous election as President of the United States seemed to prove this ideal.

But the fact, described in a solemn statement by (third US President Jefferson), shattered this utopian theory. Political parties are necessary to express political views, educate the people, promote policies, and criticize the government. Jefferson said that parties are crucial to freedom. His words are simple: "In any free and deliberative society, according to human nature, there must be opposing factions, fierce disagreements, and differences of opinion; and one of these must necessarily prevail for a longer or shorter period. Perhaps this division into parties is necessary to exercise mutual oversight and to detail the actions of the other side to the people."

The initial division of American parties—Federalists and Republicans—like the two-party precedent in Great Britain, was inevitable. Washington acknowledged the two parties when selecting his first cabinet. In the national and aristocratic aspect, he chose Hamilton as Secretary of the Treasury and Knox as Secretary of War. Among the democrats, he chose Jefferson as Secretary of State and Randolph as Attorney General. The disagreements in cabinet meetings were perhaps no less than the disagreements in the country. A few years later, both parties underwent formal reorganization, and every American knew that their struggle would determine the trend of constitutional development. The Federalists and Republicans each strived to have the government governed according to their methods, just as the Whigs and Tories sought to shape the unwritten British constitution.

Here, there is a point of principled divergence. The main purpose of the Federalists was to enable the articles of the Constitution to expand the power of the federal government. The main purpose of the Jeffersonian party was to make the Constitution sufficient to limit the federal government and increase local power. Two opposing ideas clashed, but from the beginning, three factors weakened the intensity of party conflict.

What were they? (1) The principle itself is a tempered beauty deduced for preservation and correction, and subject to sudden changes occurring for the sake of expediency. Therefore, once Jefferson came to power, he indeed made more extensive use of the federal government than Adams had, such as the Louisiana Purchase (purchased from France in 1803, the land from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian border, which later became fourteen central US states), and at that time, the good Democrat Jackson was proving to be a staunch advocate of a strong federal government. (2) Both parties paid attention to all kinds of subsidiary issues, such as tariffs, domestic reform, and foreign policy. When they paid such attention, both parties appealed to constantly fluctuating groups. (3) Each party had a healthy reputation for listening to public sentiment, so the majority could not abuse power, and the minority, obeying the majority, had a tacit understanding that no abuse of power would occur.

Why does the two-party system exist?

From Hamilton to the present day, there are many reasons why the two-party system has been able to endure. One is that in a populous democracy, the expense of maintaining a national party every four years is unaffordable for many small splinter parties. Secondly, most great leaders rise and become influential within the two main parties. But most importantly, the two-party system suits the genius of the people. They demand a responsible authority, thereby achieving stability; they demand that it be monitored by a strong opposition party; they demand the use of its power, but this is done through compromise, while giving due attention to the rights of the minority.

Is such a party system democratic? Before the American Civil War, the Democratic Party was controlled by a limited group of slave owners, who donated money and effort to the party more enthusiastically than any other group. After the Civil War, the Republican Party was controlled by big business for a long time, but the party's institutions, through direct primaries, improved propaganda, and campaign donation restrictions, have been improved, so that broader control can be achieved. If there is anything that needs to be improved, it can be obtained. The complexity within each party allows for the realization of democracy.

If there is any lesson in American history, it is that undemocratically controlled parties will sooner or later suffer severe punishment. Rebellious elements will gather among party members, and reform groups will rise up against servile oligarchies, or large corporations, or any other manipulative group. They joined the opposition party, and the "independent" faction's participation was so great that they played a decisive role in promoting more democratic management of party affairs.

This American system is rarely understood, so that several critics repeatedly raise a question: "Why can't we have a conservative party and a liberal party?" This statement really neglects the main function of the two major parties. Because the two major parties are a mixture rather than a solvent. Their basic value in the United States is to bring together a large number of different social groups, economic groups, ethnic groups, and rights of various regions to achieve collaborative governance.

The greatest disaster in American history, the Civil War, was caused by temporary party divisions formed by region. The worst disaster that could happen to the United States in the future would be a division along economic and class lines. The American people have many reasons to feel joyful rather than distressed because the Democratic and Republican parties are so similar that the transfer of power from one party to another does not cause violent shocks.

Represents a cross-section of the people

Most importantly, each party is quite able to represent a cross-section of the nation, including the rich and the poor, farmers and city clerks, Catholics, Jews, and Christians, natives and immigrants. The vast differences in wealth prevent any division between the rich and the poor. But suppose the United States really had a Conservative Party composed of property owners and a Radical Party composed of the propertyless, then it could be expected that the party that ultimately failed in the elections would build all kinds of obstacles in the streets.

The American-style two-party system also has its obvious shortcomings. Obviously, parties that are too large, too loose, and too inconsistent are prone to causing division. It is equally obvious that these large parties, which need to constantly seek agreements between all levels, are inevitably difficult to be consistent. When the American Civil War crisis was very deep, President Lincoln, after the failure at Fredericksburg, in order to unite the Republican Party, attempted to obtain the resignations of Seward, the darling of the conservatives within the party, and Chase, the darling of the radicals, in order to balance the two factions. This was a very effective method, but it cannot be interpreted as the highest political path.

Nevertheless, the benefits of the current existing system outweigh its shortcomings. The entire tradition is to build the government on a strong and responsible majority, which will effectively hold power, but will also respect the rights of the minority. Americans believe that entrusting the two major parties is relatively safer because they protect the rights of the minority through limitations and checks and balances. They believe it is safer because even the most powerful presidents—Jackson, Lincoln, Wilson, and the two Roosevelts—have not shown any dictatorial tendencies, although those short-lived party members have made contrary claims.

The United States is also unwilling to give up the broad benefits created by the fact that both major parties can represent every element of different societies. Third parties are never like this; they often represent one idea—abolition, prohibition, populism—so they are only one group. In such a country that is so large, with such diverse resources, climates, and economic and social interests, and with such complex people and their beliefs, promoting unity is an important condition for these parties. In this people who have and enhance their emotions regarding changing problems, a party organization based on the principles of unity and compromise is obviously very valuable.

The nature of the American political institutions has changed surprisingly little from the time of Hamilton and Jefferson to the present. We can say that the stability of the United States is largely due to this fact. (Translated by the US Information Service)

### Silver Dollar and Overseas Remittance Quotations to Be Listed; Likely to Begin This Morning; Gold and Silver Equalization Committee Scheduled to Meet Today

[East China News Agency] The long-anticipated listing of silver dollar and overseas remittance quotations may begin simultaneously this morning. The Gold and Silver Equalization Committee is scheduled to meet this morning, and all committee members will attend. Barring unforeseen changes, the listing is expected to proceed. The price fluctuations will be subject to flexible adjustments based on circumstances.

### Exchange of Deposit Receipts and Payments Between Banking Institutions to Be Handled by the Clearing House Starting Today

[East China News Agency] The Shanghai Clearing House has received an official letter from the Central Bank stating that the exchange of deposit receipts and payments for clearing accounts of all banking institutions will be handled exclusively by the Clearing House, starting from the 16th of this month (today). Previously, the balance of exchange accounts of all banks and money houses in the city was deposited in two locations: those with clearing numbers before 50 (the "large exchange") were deposited with the National Bank, while those with numbers 50 and above (the "small exchange") were deposited with the Clearing House. Under the new regulations, all will be handled by the Clearing House. Therefore, the balances of deposit accounts originally opened at the National Bank by the "large exchange" banking institutions with numbers before 50 have been settled by the National Bank as of the 14th (last Saturday) and will be transferred to the Clearing House this morning. These banking institutions can issue checks from the National Bank this morning and deposit them into the Clearing House to open clearing deposit accounts for exchange balance receipts and payments. From now on, the clearing of checks for all banks and money houses in the city will be unified by the Clearing House, and the terms "large exchange" and "small exchange" have become relics of financial history. It is reported that the total amount of deposits of banking institutions with numbers before 50 at the National Bank reaches 1 trillion yuan, and all of it will be transferred from the National Bank to the Clearing House this morning, after which the banking institutions will issue checks from the National Bank Business Department and send them to the Clearing House for transfer to the National Bank Business Department for accounting.

### New Home Designs

Translated Article from the United States Information Service

Forward-looking architects in the United States who are engaged in the design of future homes and buildings are already anticipating startling changes in the construction of houses. In terms of its development potential, advances in architecture will gradually evolve from experimental designs to practical manufacturing.

Future sunlight will not enter homes through windows in the walls, but will be attracted by the entire building, filtered, and appropriately combined with artificial light to create an integrated environment that meets specific requirements. Many of these necessary materials and equipment are already readily available. First, there is a mysterious control tool—the photoelectric cell. This photoelectric cell can sense the slightest changes in light. It is now being used to turn on and off lights in classrooms, open and close classroom doors, and count the number of people entering a classroom. This is almost a reasonable way to automatically control any kind of light problem.

Mechanically Movable Active Walls are now a common thing in American industry, and many houses are now equipped with active roofs that can be slid to one side with the push of a button. Huge metal and plastic blinds will be automatically controlled by machines to adjust the sunlight.

Future buildings will all use glass that can transmit ultraviolet rays, because ordinary glass blocks ultraviolet rays. This type of glass will also block infrared rays, which ordinary glass mostly lets in. The toilets used will not be a mixture of blinds, frosted glass, and curtains, but will be replaced by a kind of "one-way" glass, which can see out but cannot be seen in. Or they will be replaced by another polarized glass, which can block the line of sight with a light flick of the finger.

Temperature regulation

Now, it seems that there is no reason why the steel frame that supports concrete floors and ceilings cannot take on the dual task of a heating coil. Resistance coils built into the walls can be installed so that they can become a source of heat when connected to electricity.

The biggest difficulty with radiant cooling systems is condensation when summer temperatures are high. In such cases, the moisture on the radiating surface is like a glass of water filled with ice water. Therefore, it limits this type of radiant cooling to areas with lower summer humidity, or to buildings where the air can be artificially dried. But the development of chemicals that can absorb moisture in the air, such as silica and potassium chloride, indicates that a simple and effective chemical method of drying the air will soon be successful. This can greatly increase indoor comfort in the summer, even without the use of cooling tools.

Radiant mechanisms solve a variety of complex architectural problems that were previously thought to be unsolvable. For example, in hospital operating rooms, patients need to be warmer during surgery, while stressed doctors want a lower temperature. Because too low a temperature can cause death for patients during surgery, and doctors are merely uncomfortable at high temperatures, doctors often accommodate patients and operate at higher temperatures. But with a source of radiation, it is possible to warm the patient with hot air on the one hand, and to "focus" the cold radiation on the doctor from the walls on the other hand to keep them cool.

Solar Heat

Solar water heaters in California and Florida have achieved considerable results by extracting ample heat from the sun each year, although these water heaters are very primitive. Now it is clear that what is needed is a way to convert "energy" into a form that is easy to store. In this regard, nature provides a technology—photochemistry. Assuming that we complete the process of mimicking the way the most common weeds use and store "energy," the design of houses will be greatly and happily modified. This work belongs to physicists and chemists. Once this problem is solved, it will be possible to use the sunlight that falls on the surface of the house to raise and lower the temperature of the house at any temperature. We can therefore also use the "surface" of the house to directly transmit thermal "energy" into the interior when temperature is needed, and to isolate it from the outside when no force is needed, while making it into charcoal, alcohol, or electricity, and storing it for future use.

Kitchen

There are already various predictions about the kitchen of tomorrow. An interesting trend is to place dishes and other utensils in cabinets at waist height. In the past, there was only one stove, but in the future, there will be a set of special kitchen utensils. As rapid cooling methods become more widely used, this same method can be used in refrigerators, with various appliances for different cooling, freezing, and quick-freezing.

We have many hopes. But many of the most difficult problems still await practical solutions. For example, dishwashing and garbage disposal are such problems. From a hygienic point of view, paper or plastic dishes that are discarded after only one use are an idea that is moving in the right direction. Even more satisfactory would be a simple and inexpensive dishwasher with infrared light to complete quick drying and sterilization. Similarly, except for farm kitchens, ordinary kitchens need a simple way to dispose of garbage. Grinding garbage into powder with an electric grinder and then pouring it into the sewer is perhaps the most effective method today.

Other kitchen appliances are still waiting for testing in the laboratory: for example, transparent stoves and cooking pots with internal lighting, high-frequency induction cooking, rotating utensil racks, and so on.

Bathroom

If the United States is famous for one thing, it is the degree of access to bathrooms that we each have. Although the bathroom has become the first successful tool in American society for removing scum from the body, it is still far from ideal. The basic drawback of the bathtub is that the water becomes increasingly turbid while washing the body. The basic advantage of the shower is that the bather is not clearing the body in stagnant water, but in flowing water. If the two are combined, it is very desirable—a constantly changing stream of water slowly flowing in a bathtub. This type of bathroom is already commonly used in medical institutions. If it is applied elsewhere, it will prompt it to be improved and have more precise pistons to control the water temperature and volume. Further research will undoubtedly create a bathtub that is less slippery, easier to clean, and feels more comfortable.

Commonly used toilets do not have the correct shape, height, and angle. In the future, toilets will be lower and angled very sharply downward and backward. The seat connected to the toilet will be automatically disinfected after each use. There are already several patented styles and designs in which the seat pops out into a disinfection box in the back, which can kill various parasites with water flow or ultraviolet light.

After use, the flushing toilet will no longer be flushed with waves of water, but with a thin layer of water to clean the entire inner wall of the toilet. This toilet will have a ventilation device. It will no longer be made of the current porcelain, but will be made of metal and plastic woven inner walls. Future flushing toilets will use knee and foot control switches. Like bathtubs, future toilets will also have flowing water instead of stagnant water. Furthermore, technically speaking, there is no reason why it cannot be reduced in weight to ten or fifteen pounds.

Aerial Housing

In 1946, the architect Weidukai designed a roof suspended by balloons for the outdoor opera theater in St. Louis. This outdoor theater is only used on summer nights, and the theater does not need a roof above it to make it a permanent building, but summer showers are very annoying. Therefore, he designed a transparent balloon filled with helium, which floats above the outdoor theater. If a sudden heavy rain occurs, a canopy made of fiberglass fabric will be lowered along nylon ropes. All of this is controlled by a motor installed in the basket outside the airship, which also houses equipment for controlling the stage lighting. Thus, when not needed, the entire mechanism can be parked elsewhere on the ground.

The Leading Team Opens the Scoring First, Resulting in a Score of Three to One

The final lesson of the Football League A, the supplementary match between the Railway Team and the Leading Team, took place at the Yiyuan Stadium from 4:00 PM yesterday. There were over 2,000 spectators. The referee was Ni Xiaoben, and the linesmen were Deng Xiaoliang and Zhang Lezhun. The game started on time. The Leading Team attacked first. Zhang Jingen went straight in along the side and took a long shot, but unfortunately it went wide. The Railway Team counterattacked. Zhang Jie received assistance from Lu Qingxiang and inserted into the gap. Lin Quyi rushed to the door and pulled, but it was unsuccessful. At 4 minutes, the Leading Team attacked again. Wu Kaimin made a high shot in the middle, and Xia Shufu headed the ball. Liao Xiong pushed it into a corner kick. Zhang Jingen took the kick. The landing point was very good. Liao Xiong pounced on the ball and fell. Chen Qin pushed it into the net. The Leading Team opened the record. The Railway Team was hit by this and counterattacked with all its strength. Zhang Jie and Lu Qingxiang attacked the goal twice, but were unsuccessful. At 20 minutes, the Railway Team got a corner kick opportunity. Lin Quyi took it out, and Lu Bingsheng headed it in, tying the score at one each. Before long, the Leading Team's Zheng Bingyi received a warning for his rough play. At this time, the Railway Team's offensive had not waned. At 39 minutes, Zhang Jie attacked again. Shi Dafa caused trouble in the penalty area and was judged a penalty kick. Xiao Ziwen made a stroke and cut into the upper corner, making it two to one. The Railway Team took the lead in the first half.

Changing formations and fighting again, the Railway Team's forwards were active. Lin Quyi cut in from the baseline, and Wu Binghao waited right there, heading the ball into the net, making it three to one. It was less than five minutes since the start of the game. The Railway Team replaced Wu Binghao with Qu Xigen. Seeing the situation was not good, the Leading Team tried to recover. Yao Qingsheng took a diagonal shot, which Liao Xiong saved and turned into a dangerous situation. At 20 minutes, Zhang Jie went straight in alone, and the Leading Team's goal was in danger again. Fortunately, Yan Chengkuan rescued it in time. As soon as he got the ball, it suddenly slipped. Zhang Jie persevered, and Zheng Bingyi cleared the siege. The Railway Team did not retreat far. Lu Qingxiang got the ball and attacked three times. Yan Chengkuan grabbed Adu, and there was no loss. The Leading Team attacked, Yao Qingsheng advanced rapidly on the side and hooked in from the baseline. Gao Baozheng rescued it.

### Prehistoric Remains Discovered in Qingjiang Dagu Mountain: Over a Hundred Pieces of Earthen City Stone Tools, All Belonging to the Black Pottery Culture System

[Changsha News] Since the discovery of the Qingjiang Dagu Mountain prehistoric site, it has indeed attracted the attention of domestic scholars. According to the discoverer, Rao Huimin's two years of investigation, there are already three sites this time, among which the Dagu Mountain Earth City yielded more than a hundred pieces of stone tools, including axes, knives, shovels, hand grinding discs, grinding sticks, and other types; more than three thousand catties of pottery shards, including black, white, gray pottery, and various items such as steel ore and textiles.

Recently, Rao Huimin, while passing through another hilly field, discovered three smaller earth cities, only half a li apart, covering areas of about five to seven mu each. In these three earth cities, he also found hundreds of pottery and stone items. The stone tools included axes, knives, grinding discs. The pottery shards featured patterns such as continuous patterns, mat patterns, grid patterns, wave patterns, swastika grid patterns, and over ten other types, as well as several flat, cone-shaped tripod legs, which were relics from the same period as those discovered in the former Dagu Earth City.

Currently, there are seven prehistoric sites discovered in Qingjiang, each surrounded by an earth city. These seven sites are all located near the overflow edge of the Gan River, within about forty li of each other. Therefore, it can be proven that the earth cities, of varying sizes, are the fortified residential sites of ancient tribal times, not cities or military defense projects of later generations. It is conceivable that the population in the Jiangnan area at that time was quite dense, and the ancient culture in the Gan River basin was also very substantial.

Moreover, according to Rao Huimin's research on the earliest discovered Dagu Mountain Earth City site, more than one-third of its relics belong to the Black Pottery Culture system. The colors are divided into glossy black, deep black, brownish-black, grayish-black, and brownish-yellow, etc. The pottery is classified into clay and mixed sand types, with varying amounts of sand mixed in, and contains quartz grains and mica flakes. The decorations include blue patterns, stripe patterns, grid patterns, rope patterns, and string patterns, with plain surfaces still predominating. There is also a type of twisted spiral decoration, made by pressing with the tip of the thumb, which is quite simple and beautiful. Comparing its color, quality, decoration, and production style, it is very similar to the black pottery unearthed in Longshan, Liangzhu, and other places.

Therefore, the discovery of black pottery at the Qingjiang prehistoric site is of great relevance to the speculation of the spread of the Longshan Black Pottery Culture, and the research on prehistoric culture in Jiangnan. Currently, the discoverer, Mr. Rao Huimin, is preparing to write an investigation report on the Qingjiang prehistoric site for the research of domestic and foreign archaeological experts.

### The Case of Zhong Liezhao, an Air Force Mechanical Officer in Hankou, Killing His Wife: His Cousin Lie Lian Is Indicted

[Hankou News] Last November in Hankou, an Air Force mechanical officer named Zhong Liezhao conspired with his cousin Zhong Lielian to murder his wife, Zhu Xiulan, with double nails. The details were previously reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the criminal Zhong Lielian has been arrested in Xingguo County, Jiangxi, and has been transferred to the Hankou Local Court for investigation. According to reports, the perpetrator, Zhong Liezhao, had another lover and became increasingly disgusted with his wife, Xiulan. Zhong Lielian also harbored animosity towards his sister-in-law. On the evening of November 8th last year, Zhong Liezhao had an argument with his wife. He then conspired with his cousin Zhong Lielian to tightly close the doors and windows late at night, violently strangling Zhu Xiulan's neck with gauze and stabbing her temples with iron nails, causing her death. Recently, the prosecutor of the Hankou Local Court conducted a detailed investigation of the arrested Zhong Lielian and determined that the evidence of the crime was conclusive. He has been indicted according to law. However, the perpetrator's brother, Zhong Lieyan, is actively lobbying in Hankou to exonerate him and has reportedly secretly bribed a certain official, Mr. Lan (from Zhangshu, Jiangxi), of the ×× Court to intercede on his behalf. However, as the perpetrator participated in the crime, and the Hankou Local Court Prosecutor's Office has filed a public prosecution, it will be difficult for him to escape punishment. The sentencing is of great concern to all parties. The full text of the indictment from the Hankou Local Court Prosecutor is recorded below:

Defendant: Zhong Lielian, male, twenty-three years old, from Qian County, Jiangxi, student, residing at Zhong Hongchang No. on Zhongshan Road, Xingguo, Jiangxi.

The above-mentioned defendant's murder case No. 291 (urgent) of the 37th year of the Republic of China has been concluded after investigation. It is believed that a prosecution should be initiated. The facts of the crime, evidence, and legal provisions are described as follows: Zhong Lielian is the cousin of Zhong Liezhao, a mechanical officer in the supply and inspection division of the Sixth Supply Branch of the Air Force. He came to Hankou and resided in Liezhao's dormitory to prepare for school exams. Liezhao had another lover and became increasingly disgusted with his wife, Zhu Xiulan. They argued many times, and Lielian also harbored animosity towards his sister-in-law. On the evening of November 8th last year, the couple had another argument. Later, Liezhao conspired with Lielian to tightly close the doors and windows late at night, strangling Zhu Xiulan's neck with gauze and stabbing her temples with iron nails, causing her death. The Liezhao brothers locked the door and fled separately. Later, their colleagues, suspecting something, opened the door the next afternoon at 5:00 PM and discovered Zhu Xiulan's body lying on the bed. They reported it to the police station, who requested an examination and investigation. Zhong Liezhao's part has been referred to the Fourth Military Region Command of the Air Force for investigation. Zhong Lielian's part has been apprehended by the Xingguo County Government of Jiangxi at the request of Zhu Xiulan's brother, Zhu Tonglian, and transferred to the court.

The body of Zhu Xiulan was found lying supine on the bed in the bedroom on the third floor of the Air Force Supply Group dormitory at No. 382 Shengli Street in this city. There were injuries on each of the left and right eyebrows, cyan-purple hard swelling, uneven circles, surrounding four cun two fen, with bloodstains, all wooden instrument injuries, each with a small hole broken inside, half a fen deep on the left, reaching the bone on the right, fresh blood flowed, stabbed by iron nails. Around the neck, there was a gauze strip, circling the neck, the knot in front, the scar was purple-brown, with bloodstains, blood halo, strangled to death. The wrists and backs of both hands, a piece of purple-red bloodstains, each with finger marks, two purple-dark spots on the back of the left hand, three purple ridge spots on the back of the right hand, each as large as a fingertip, injured by someone's hand before death, verified by this court's Inspector Ao, confirming that she was strangled at the neck and injured in the temples before death, a medical report is on file. During the examination, Air Force intern officer Chuan Jingxun testified: "After eating dinner on Monday the 8th, the couple and a cousin surnamed Zhong were still in the room. At that time, the three were in the room and there was no quarrel. Later, Zhong Liezhao's brother went out. I went to the street at 8:00 PM that night and didn't come home until after 9:00 PM. I heard fighting noises coming from their room. I knocked on their door, and the noise stopped. After we returned to our room, they started fighting again. I immediately went downstairs and called the mechanical officer Liu Chude. Then we went upstairs again and knocked on their door. For more than a quarter of an hour, there was no sound coming from inside. Later, we left. The next morning, we saw that their door was locked. It wasn't until 5:00 PM that I and Liu Jiande opened the door and found Mrs. Zhong dead in the bed," and Liu Jiande also provided the same information. When the cook Jia Rongtang was asked, "Do you know their brother?" he answered, "I also know Zhong Lielian. I live downstairs, and they live upstairs. I only heard loud noises upstairs, but I didn't see them taking anything away." It is certain that Zhong Lielian was in Hankou that day. However, the defendant claimed that he took a car to Zhuzhou on the 7th of that month, which is obviously false. Since the defendant was in Hankou and lived in the same room as his brother and sister-in-law, who can believe that his sister-in-law was murdered without his involvement? Also, according to the defendant, Zhong Liezhao's mother lived in the room, but according to Zhong Liechun, his mother had already gone home, which proves that the defendant's words are evasive. There are suspicions of crimes under Article 28 and Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, a public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, and the court is requested to adjudicate.

### Domestically Produced Motor Vehicles in Guangzhou

[Guangzhou News] The production of motor vehicles in our country is still the first to be seen in the Guangzhou market after the war. Motor vehicles manufactured by Xingye Machinery Factory are already running on the market. They are often seen speeding through the streets, adding to the color of traffic. The reporter visited the factory's sales department and workshop, and the impressions obtained are reported as follows, in order to enlighten readers:

No. 19 Jiaoyu Road is the factory's sales department, located in a quiet and convenient place. Various colored vehicles are displayed, attracting a large number of spectators. They all look closely with a curious mind. The technicians there are busy explaining the structure, performance, and driving methods of the car to the audience, as well as all the questions that general customers want to know. The head of the sales department, Mr. He, greeted the reporter with a kind smile and explained the products that have been achieved after two years of experimentation and improvement: such as saving fuel, suitable for China's economic situation, and easy to drive, aiming to popularize applications. He also gave a detailed description of the entire manufacturing process. He also instructed the technicians to conduct an actual demonstration in public. Mr. He also invited the reporter to try driving. After listening to all the steps, the reporter was able to drive without any difficulty, deeply feeling the ease of operation. After starting, sitting on the car and stepping on the ground with both feet, just rotate the rubber tube held by the right hand, and the car will move forward slowly. Wait for the speed to increase and balance before lifting both feet to the pedals. Then the speed of the car is controlled only by twisting the rubber tube on the right hand to the left and right. After more than ten minutes of galloping and inspection, it is felt that it is even easier to drive than an ordinary bicycle. Because the car body is light and compact, the height is moderate, the center of gravity is low and the center of gravity is wide, so there is no difficulty in supporting it at all. Driving can be said to be absolutely safe. This achievement is particularly brilliant in China's industrial sector!

In order to understand the manufacturing situation of the factory in the field, the reporter went to the factory headquarters for a visit. The factory director was instructed to enter the workshop, where dozens of young technicians and apprentices were concentrating on various tasks. Each department had specialized personnel to supervise and guide, and the work atmosphere was quite tense. Various machine equipment was very complete, including several working machines, which were said to be the only ones in the city. The only regret is that the factory area seemed to be too small, which made the storage of assembled vehicles somewhat cramped. Seeing various accessories that have not been constructed, have been constructed, and are being constructed, it is enough to prove that they are purely domestic products.

My friend Mr. Huang bought a car. The reporter believed that he should be able to understand the advantages and disadvantages of driving after using it for a month, so he immediately asked him about it. He said that after buying this car, the suffering of "traveling" has been completely solved. The money and time spent on long-distance buses and tricycles in the past can now be reduced by five to ten times. There have been no problems in more than a month. Only once, it was driven away by his friend, but it was left on the roadside, which delayed some time. Because he only knew that driving was easy, he ignored asking for the knowledge that should be possessed, so after the engine died, he did not know how to start it. Therefore, Yu Yi said that the factory must print a simple instruction manual and attach it to the car so that every driver can temporarily understand the methods they should do, which will definitely reduce a lot of trouble.

From what I have learned, the factory can have this product, which is a great contribution to transportation, especially being able to ensure driving safety and reduce the occurrence of accidents, is one of its characteristics; in a country with backward industry like China, most people do not have a deep understanding of machinery, which leads to the psychology of seeing machines as difficult and troublesome. However, this car is made in the simplest way, which is the second of its characteristics; the speed and impact force are very moderate, and the Haizhu Bridge and Guanyin Mountain can go up and down freely, and the fuel consumption is economical, which is also the third of its characteristics; in terms of application, its price is almost three times different from imported products, which is very suitable for China's economic capacity. Secondly, the service spirit of the factory staff should be commended, that is, they can always fulfill their responsibilities to customers and audiences, whether it is teaching driving, maintenance and use, or even if there is any difficult problem to solve, if you tell them by phone, the factory can send someone to drive to assist within a few minutes. In short, in our country with backward science and unstable economy, it is rare to overcome various difficulties and achieve this achievement, but it is still hoped that the factory can strengthen its publicity efforts and print more instructions for the car to arouse the general interest in machinery, then the future is unlimited.

### Reader Consultation: Legal Explanation: Housing Dispute Issues

Answered by Lawyer Tang Mingshi

Wu Ming Asks: A certain friend, Jia, rented a house from Yi in the 33rd year of the Republic of China, specifying a term of one year, and Jia paid Yi a deposit of 15,000 Chu banknotes as a transfer fee. If Jia does not move out after the term expires, Yi can demand that Jia transfer the entire house to him for 200,000 general legal tender, without any excuses. Later, due to the situation, Jia did not move out after the term expired. Recently, Yi passed away, and his son-in-law, Bing, asked Ding to jointly demand that Jia pay for Yi's funeral expenses, otherwise, he would fulfill the previous agreement and demand Jia move out within a time limit. There are several questions, please answer them.

(1) Is this housing contract established during the enemy-puppet period still valid now? (2) After the expiration of this contract, the two parties did not revise the contract, but continued to live for four years. Now the lessor still wants to handle the matter according to the original contract and demand that the lessee give up the house. Does this contract still have lease rights? (3) Assuming that this contract has lost its lease rights, and the lessor wants to transfer the entire house to others in the name of handling the funeral, or transfer a part of the lessee's residence to others, and then force the lessee to move out, is it permitted by current law? (4) When the lessee entered the house at that time, he had paid 15,000 yuan in general currency. Is this fee considered a transfer fee? (5) If the lessor asks the lessee to subsidize any expenses in the name of handling the funeral, can it be rejected? (6) If the lessor privately transfers part of the house occupied by the lessee to others for three taels of gold, is it a crime in law? (7) This contract did not have stamp duty affixed at the time. Is this contract valid? (8) But the lessee is really in difficulty and unable to move out. To prevent future safety, should he register with the local police station in advance?

[Answer] (1) A private contract, agreed upon by both parties, is valid. Therefore, a lease established even during the enemy-puppet period should also be considered valid. (2) For a fixed-term lease, if the lessee continues to pay rent after the term expires, and the lessor continues to collect rent, then a non-fixed-term lease relationship has been established between the two parties, and the lessee has obtained lease rights. (3) Illegal forced eviction is of course not permitted by law. (4) If there is a payment in addition to the rent, whether it is a transfer fee or a security deposit, it depends on the evidence recognized by both parties. (5) There is no reason for the lessor's family to ask the lessee to subsidize the funeral expenses. If it is for relief purposes, it should be discussed separately. (6) The Shanghai Municipal Government has repeatedly ordered that transfer fees are not allowed to be received. If there is a private transfer, it can be reported to the Land Administration Bureau. (7) The validity of a contract is not affected by stamp duty. Missing stamp duty will only be punished and supplemented according to the Stamp Duty Law, and will not cause the contract to become invalid. (8) You can explain the situation to the local police station so that there is a basis in case of future incidents.
