### University Professors National Policy Research Association Proposes Concrete Peace Program Hoping That Both the Nationalists and Communists Can Accept It Together, and Initiates the Organization of the Peace Promotion Association to Negotiate Peace

[Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 13th] The National Policy Research Association of Chinese University Professors previously issued a telegram responding to the President's proclamation, calling on the CCP for peace and suggesting the convening of a new political consultative conference to organize a coalition government. The association has now launched an initiative to contact parties and social leaders outside the Nationalists and Communists to organize a "Peace Promotion Association" to negotiate peace with both sides and put forward a more concrete peace program, hoping that both sides will sacrifice party interests and accept it together. The peace program drafted by the association is as follows: A. Steps for peace talks: (1) The Nationalist and Communist sides will immediately cease fire, and all troops in all battlefields will retreat a certain number of miles to their original positions. Those who have not participated in the war will stop at their original defense. (2) The Nationalist and Communist sides will immediately stop all propaganda warfare, and both sides will simultaneously release political prisoners and lift the ban on speech. (3) The Nationalist and Communist sides will each send plenipotentiary representatives and organize a new political consultative conference with the third party, and invite friendly countries to mediate. (4) The composition of the new political consultative conference is divided into ten parts: the Nationalist Party, the Communist Party, middle parties, public opinion organs, people's organizations, and social leaders, six representatives each from six aspects, forming a "6-6 ratio system." Mediators will be invited from the four ambassadors of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France. (5) The meeting place of the new political consultative conference will be in Shanghai. B. Methods of the consultative conference: (1) The voting method of the new political consultative conference, matters concerning procedures should be decided by more than one-half of the attendees, and matters concerning resolutions should be decided by more than two-thirds of the attendees. If a resolution cannot be reached, the mediator may arbitrate. (2) All meeting processes and disputes should be announced daily to accept public opinion and public criticism. C. The system of the coalition government: (1) Establish a temporary coalition government, adopting a committee system, and its composition still uses the "6-6 ratio system" of the new political consultative conference, that is, party members account for half, and non-party people's representatives account for half (because the number of party members in all parties in the country may not reach 1% of the total population, the temporary government is to accommodate the fact that each accounts for half), and its chairman is served by a social leader, and two vice-chairmen are served by the Nationalists and Communists respectively. (2) The coalition government separately drafts a temporary government organization law and a common implementation program after the peace talks. (3) In the war zones of both sides, a buffer zone is delineated, and social leaders are responsible for handling local administration, directly under the control of the coalition government. (4) Implement the nationalization of the army. Officers and soldiers of the national defense army are not allowed to have party membership. Active military personnel are not allowed to hold concurrent civil positions. (5) Each party follows democratic methods and engages in political competition. When the temporary government lasts for one year, a general election campaign will be launched to establish a new public opinion organ. (6) The new public opinion organ decides the existence, abolition, or amendment of the constitution, and then generates a formal government based on the constitution.

### British Prosecutor Kerr Discusses CCP Policy

Compares it to MacArthur's Policy in Japan

[Dispatch from the Associated Press, London, 12th] Kerr, a British prosecutor for the Far East International Military Tribunal, compared the CCP's policy to General MacArthur's policy in Japan on the 12th. He told the Royal Empire Association: "According to the records collected from Europeans currently residing in the CCP area, and the original text of the CCP's proclamations, the Chinese Communist Party was originally a party of farmland reform. Their new farmland laws are generally not more radical than those implemented in Japan under MacArthur's pressure. Both do not intend to redistribute the existing cultivated land among the farmers, including the current landlords." Kerr said that he had no intention of criticizing "MacArthur's outstanding achievements," but only to solemnly point out that MacArthur's policy can be a good example of the most effective measure to combat communism.

Lieutenant General Gilner, who was Churchill's personal representative to Japan in 1945 and stayed in Japan for three years, also had the same belief as mentioned above. He said: "I refer to this as a new solution to the Far East problem. We should transport raw materials to areas threatened by the Communist Party, which is enough to raise the standard of living higher than the Communist Party allows. This move may ultimately prove to cost less than a vast military operation."

Editorial

### Looking Ahead to the Southeast Asia Conference

The crisis in Southeast Asia has been further aggravated by the resurgence of the Dutch-Indonesian conflict. No one can deny that imperialism and communism, in the eyes of the people of Southeast Asian countries, are no different from "tyrannical government" and "fierce tigers." If they are not allowed to jointly seek self-defense and self-salvation but are forced to choose one of the two, then in the situation where "tyrannical government is fiercer than tigers," the trend of the Southeast Asian situation is naturally predictable.

Indian leader Nehru, indignant at the Dutch atrocities in Indonesia and seeking to save the crisis in Southeast Asia, specifically called on fourteen Asian countries to send representatives to New Delhi to hold an International Conference on Southeast Asia to discuss the new situation caused by the Dutch invasion of Indonesia. This proposal has not only been unanimously approved by various countries in East Asia but has also aroused the attention of the United Kingdom and the United States. It is generally believed that this conference can assist the United Nations in resolving the Dutch-Indonesian dispute; at the same time, a regional security mechanism can be born from this. Therefore, American political commentator Louis Fischer has requested the US government to send a "sympathetic observer" to participate and believes that this conference will be able to take "effective action" on the Dutch-Indonesian dispute.

The Southeast Asia Conference was originally scheduled to open on the 16th, but due to insufficient preparations, it was postponed to the 20th. There is no doubt that it will be able to open as scheduled at that time. We attach importance to the significance of this conference and are willing to put forward some opinions on the eve of the opening for the reference of Asian countries and other relevant national authorities.

First, the Asian population accounts for half of the world's population, and the area accounts for one-third of the globe. Based on these two points alone, in today's century of the people, Asia actually occupies an important position internationally, which cannot be ignored by anyone. In the past, Asian countries were largely reduced to colonies of advanced European and American industrial countries due to political and economic backwardness, exploited and slaughtered without realizing it. But today, the people of Asia have been stirred by the tide of the great era and have long been thoroughly awakened. In politics, they firmly demand independence and freedom; in economics, they also demand freedom and equality. The turmoil in various Asian countries after the Second World War all contains profound national movements. The independence of India and Burma is certainly so, and the efforts of Vietnam and Indonesia are no different. Therefore, we ask all countries in the world not to treat Asian groups with the old concept of the past—colonies—otherwise, dealing with any disputes will only increase the source of chaos and make the Asian situation worse.

Second, the crisis currently facing the Asian people is that the infiltration of communist forces is like mercury spilling on the ground, penetrating everywhere, so that all Asian countries are threatened by it; another is that the forces of imperialism are deeply rooted. The suffering of the people of Vietnam and Indonesia is the deepest and greatest. Under the principle of "tyrannical government is fiercer than tigers," most people naturally only become more left-leaning. A London Times editorial on the 10th still claimed that the national movements in Southeast Asia would be exploited by Moscow, a view that the people of Asia cannot accept. Taking the recent Dutch invasion of Indonesia as an example, the Netherlands in Indonesia did not hesitate to violate the armistice agreement, directly taking military action and attacking the Indonesian capital Yogyakarta with the army, navy, and air force, exposing the face of imperialism without reservation. Speaking of the United States' handling of the Dutch-Indonesian dispute, it has never had a "firm and unwavering" stance. Although the US representative is now also condemning the Dutch invasion of Indonesia in strong terms, some people still suspect that the United States is secretly supporting the Dutch actions in Indonesia. We hope that the new Secretary of State Acheson will quickly take wise measures to clarify the world's suspicions.

Third, for the sake of self-defense and self-salvation, Asia today does need a regional security mechanism to promote mutual understanding and cooperation among the people of Asia and jointly seek the stability and prosperity of Asia. But this kind of mechanism must be organized by the Asian people themselves. The "Eastern Alliance" advocated by Britain and Australia last December cannot but be viewed with reservations by the people of Asia. First of all, it is necessary to understand who the master of this "Eastern Alliance" is, whether it is the Asian countries or the British and American countries outside Asia. Therefore, standing on the position of the people of Asia, rather than waiting for outsiders to come out and lead the organization of the "Eastern Alliance," it is better to automatically organize an "Asian Alliance" at the New Delhi Conference.

In short, the arrival of the Asian century, like the torrent of the times, is irresistible. The call of the New Delhi Conference is the harbinger of the arrival of the Asian century. The awakening and unity of the Asian people makes all countries in the world cannot but "look at each other with new eyes," unless there are still stubbornly unenlightened imperial powers in the world, otherwise today they will never again treat Asia as a colony.

### Hoffman Condemns the Soviet Union; It is Extremely Close to Seizing All of China; He Also Points Out That Our Reliance on Force to Suppress the Communists is a Fundamental Mistake

[Central News Agency, Detroit, 12th, United Press] Economic Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman recently stated here that the Soviet Politburo is doing its utmost to achieve world domination. It is said that the absolute belief has been obtained from the observations made during this global trip, that the primary purpose of Soviet policies and movements is to proceed with strength and determination. Hitler's efforts in those years pale in comparison. Mr. Li's statement was drafted in advance and was made to the Automotive Engineers Association here and is the most vehement condemnation of the Soviet Union by a responsible US official. Hoffman believes that although the recent communist activities in the United States and abroad have been exposed, the American people still do not know what is happening now and are unaware of the seriousness of the threat itself and the global crisis. He continued: The Soviet Union is cruel and unscrupulous, and the cunning and skillful implementation of its policies can only be compared with Machiavelli (a 15th-century conspiratorial politician). It is said that the Soviet government's great dream is to strengthen the control of the Kremlin's satellite states and establish a world dictatorship. He listed the various achievements of the Soviet Union since the Japanese surrender and said that Stalin can be complacent about this result. In addition to seizing several countries in Europe, the Kremlin is extremely close to seizing all of China. The situation in China is extremely serious.

[Special Dispatch] New York, 12th (Broadcast): Hoffman said in a speech at the Automotive Engineers Conference that in addition to controlling several European countries, the Communist Party will also control all of China, leading to an extremely serious situation. Hoffman said: The fundamental mistake of the Chinese government's war of suppressing the Communists is the mistaken belief that communism can be defeated by force alone. The efforts of the various provinces of China are mostly focused on the military aspect. The leaders of the provinces have concentrated their manpower and material resources in an attempt to contain communism by force, but they have done almost nothing to improve the people's lives, thus creating a tragic ending. However, Hoffman specifically pointed out that Yan Xishan, the chairman of Shanxi Province, alone has true insight into the overall situation and has unique vision. Hoffman recounted that Yan had written a booklet entitled "Methods to Deal with the Communist Party," which said that unless popular support is strong, it is difficult to win the war. Hoffman then quoted some of the proposals in the book, such as eliminating class divisions, organizing mass organizations, discussing government goals, implementing food rationing regardless of wealth, seeking economic equality, and implementing a rural reform militia system.

### Ministry of National Defense Announces Weekly Battle Situation - From January 6th to 12th -

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The Ministry of National Defense recently announced the weekly battle situation from January 6th to 12th. The full text is as follows:

At a time when the whole country is unanimously seeking peace, unexpectedly, the Communist bandits recently launched a major military offensive with their main forces, fiercely attacking the Tianjin and Yongxu areas. It seems that this action of theirs is an informal response to the national people's call for peace. Under the decision and guidance of being able to fight and make peace without avoiding war to seek peace, the National Army soldiers are all able to be loyal and courageous, fighting with the bandits and giving them a heavy blow. The situation of each battlefield is summarized below:

(1) Du Yuming Corps Fights Bitterly and Breaks Through

Since Deputy Commander-in-Chief Du Yuming transferred to Xuzhou via Nanjing from the Northeast on November 6th, he has commanded the Qiu Qingquan, Sun Yuanliang, and Li Mi corps, continuously fighting with the superior main force of Chen Yi's bandits. The combat period has been two months and six days. In the first month, he fought fiercely with the bandits near Xuzhou more than a dozen times, and destroyed nearly ten columns of bandits. He never rested or reorganized. Later, he was ordered to transfer south from Xuzhou to prevent the joint southward advance of the two bandits, Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng. In early December, he arrived in the area between Yongcheng and Suxian and began main force combat with the bandits. After a month of fierce and bitter fighting, except for the entire Sun Yuanliang corps that had already broken through, the Qiu and Li corps had been besieged by the superior bandits in the small area around Chen Guanzhuang and Qinglongji for the past month, relying entirely on air supply. During this period, they encountered ten days of wind, rain, ice, and snow, and the officers and soldiers suffered from insufficient food and fuel, and were hungry and cold. In a sad mood, they relied on slaughtering warhorses to satisfy their hunger. There was no tree bark or grass roots left in the驻地. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Du and Commanders Qiu and Li and other senior generals still shared the joys and sorrows with the soldiers and endured hardships together, often not getting even half a full meal all day long. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Du fell ill half a month ago, and the Ministry of National Defense sent planes twice to pick him up for medical treatment, but he refused to leave, saying that he was willing to stay with his troops and share their hardships. Until the morning of the 6th of this month, Chen Bandit gathered the newly replenished first, second, third, fourth, eighth, ninth, tenth, thirteenth, Liangguang, Luzhongnan, Kuaisu, and Bohai fifteen columns, and another three independent brigades, as well as militiamen from Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Jinan, totaling about 300,000 people, and launched an all-out attack. Our Du's troops, in coordination with the air force, fought bloody battles with the bandits for five consecutive days. The fighting was unprecedentedly fierce. During this period, more than 50,000 bandits were killed or wounded by the National Army's counterattacks and aircraft bombings, and the National Army also suffered more than 30,000 casualties. The main positions were completely scorched earth. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Du led his troops to break out of the encirclement on the morning of the 10th. Because the bandits had dug more than five long trenches around them and were covered with landmines and artillery, the sacrifices and losses of the breakout troops were inevitable. There are still several units moving westward and southward, fighting along the way. In total, for the past month, our Du Corps was ordered to hold the Yong area, using one month to contain the southward advance of the bandits. The Du Corps only began to break out of the encirclement five days after the deadline. Strategically, it has completed its task of buying time and covering the deployment of the National Army in the Jianghuai area, and has achieved the price of killing or wounding more than 100,000 bandits. The heroic deeds of the entire army's arduous combat and heroic sacrifice are worthy of being a model for the National Army. In the Jianghuai area, all parts of northern Jiangsu are very peaceful due to the strengthened deployment of the National Army. The National Army on the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has been actively launching attacks in the past week, sweeping away the local Communists on both sides of the railway. The important bandit strongholds of Gucheng Tie (about 70 li north of Lai'an City) and Outang Town (east of Dingyuan) were captured by the National Army on the 6th. The Lianghuai Independent Brigade, the 34th Brigade, and the bandit units of Su Yu and Sun Chuanjia were defeated and fled with injuries. There are now no traces of bandits within 40 li on both sides of the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway.

(2) National Army in Tianjin Wins Successive Battles

In Tianjin, fierce battles in the surrounding areas of Tianjin have been unfolding since the 6th. The main force of Lin Biao's bandits, seven columns, launched a full-scale attack. Lin Bandit's approximately 7th and 8th columns attacked the southeastern part of Tianjin City from Huidui, the 9th column attacked due south, the 1st and 2nd columns attacked western Tianjin, and the 3rd column and the Second Independent Brigade attacked northern Tianjin. The battles were most intense on the east and west sides. From the 6th to the 10th, after five days and nights of bloody battles, we defeated the 19th and 21st divisions of the 7th column, the 22nd division of the 8th column, the 4th and 6th divisions of the 2nd column, and one division of the 1st column, killing and wounding more than 21,000 bandits. Our army only suffered heavy losses in five battalions, with less than 3,000 casualties. Although the bandits charged to near the city defense works several times, the offensive of the bandits was contained because our army bravely charged at the bandits and each battlefield was able to win more with less. At the moment, the National Army soldiers are using their victorious emotions and firm confidence to calmly counterattack the bandits. After repeated attacks and defeats, the bandits suffered heavy casualties and had to retreat to the northeast and west for reorganization, and drew the 4th and 5th columns from near Beiping for reinforcement. At the moment, the outer Tianjin fortifications are still standing strong.

In the Tanggu area, there have been no changes in the situation in recent days. The National Army search and suppression troops are constantly making contact with the bandits on the periphery. Xinhuaibeitang and the two places are still being held by the National Army.

In total, in the battle near Tianjin, the National Army has shown an increasingly courageous spirit. Since yesterday, the fighting has slowed down slightly. It is expected that the bandits will definitely attack again after replenishment and reinforcement. At that time, the National Army will give them another heavy blow.

In the Beiping area, since last week, Lin Biao's bandit troops around Beiping have been transferred eastward to besiege Tianjin. The Lin bandits remaining in the suburbs of Beiping are the 11th column and part of the 6th column. The rest are the Nie Rongzhen bandit troops that have fled from the Ping-Sui and Ping-Han lines, including the first, second, third, fourth, sixth, and seventh six columns. In the past week, there have only been sporadic battles in the four suburbs of Beiping. In addition to the occasional mutual bombardment between the bandit and our artillery, the National Army has been driving back small groups of bandits who are disrupting the peace.

### Acheson Attends Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Explains Foreign Policy Views, and Answers Various Inquiries About His Relationship with Hiss and Others

[Report from this newspaper] Washington, 13th Broadcast: The Senate Foreign Relations Committee met today to discuss Acheson's nomination as Secretary of State. Acheson made a special trip to the meeting to answer questions. The questions asked by the committee members focused on Acheson's experience, Acheson's relationship with Hiss, a former State Department official who was recently indicted by the Supreme Court for perjury, and the relationship between Acheson's law firm and the Polish government. Acheson said that he and Hiss were colleagues and friends, but Hiss was not his assistant. He also said, "Hiss's Turner, Hiss was my assistant. Turner served the country and was very diligent. He is still an assistant in the law firm I run. He also said that his firm had long severed its relationship with the Polish government.

[United Press, Washington, 13th] Truman's nominee for Secretary of State, Acheson, appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today to answer rumors that he favored a "moderate" policy toward the Soviet Union. Acheson seems confident that he will be able to secure the trust vote of the committee and even the Senate.

Committee Chairman Connally said that Acheson would have the opportunity to answer various rumors from the outside world, such as Acheson's views on foreign policy, his relationship with Hiss (a former State Department official accused of stealing wartime State Department secrets to supply to a Soviet spy ring), and the business relationship between his law firm and the Polish Communist government. Several Republicans privately admitted that a telegram from former Assistant Secretary of State Peel on the evening of the 12th had destroyed their plans. Peel had once opposed Acheson's "friendly" policy toward the Soviet Union, but 致电 the Foreign Relations Committee, saying that he believed that Acheson's views had changed significantly in the past four years. He urged Congress to expedite the approval of Acheson's appointment. Peel himself may appear to testify.

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The plan to thoroughly reorganize the U.S. State Department has been drafted by the Hoover Commission. According to geographical distribution, five assistants will be set up in the State Department for the Far East, Near East, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. The new Secretary of State Acheson also participated in this drafting work. Most of the recommendations in the Commission's report are based on a plan drafted a year ago by State Department Assistant Dean Acheson. The original plan was not approved because Secretary of State Marshall and Dean Rusk were busy dealing with diplomatic issues and did not have time to carry out the reorganization plan. Dean Acheson is Dean Acheson's best friend, and Dean Acheson will remain in office after the Secretary of State takes office on the 20th of this month. The main point of the proposed reorganization is to divide the work of the State Department according to country and region, not according to type of work. Under the new system, the work of the Far East Division will include the State Department's policies, economics, intelligence, and public affairs regarding the Far East.

### U.S. Secretary of Defense Requests Authorization to Send Military Missions Abroad, The Advisory Group to China Can Be Established for a Long Time

[United Press, Washington, 12th] Secretary of Defense Forrestal today submitted a plan to the Senate Armed Services Committee, requesting permission to send military representatives to various parts of the world to promote U.S. global interests. The delegations are divided into three types: (1) general military assistance; (2) American international cooperation, which is actually equivalent to military assistance to American countries; (3) authorizing each delegation to formulate programs for global interests. According to the military delegation plan, it is one of a series of national defense plans of the Forrestal, and other plans will be submitted one after another.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] Once the Forrestal plan is approved, the U.S. military advisory group to China can be established for a long time.

### U.S. Air Force Plan

There are still Differences of Opinion Within the Government

[French News Agency, Washington, 12th] U.S. Air Force circles and congressional figures said that although President Truman's message to Congress intends to reduce the Air Force's strength to 48 combat teams, Congress may decide to increase it to 70 teams. Currently, the U.S. Air Force has a total of 60 teams, one of which is currently used for the Berlin airlift. It also said that the difference of opinion between Truman and the Air Force leaders is not only about strength, but also about policy, because the Air Force leaders advocate that the United States should adopt a firm policy toward the Soviet Union, while Truman and his advisors fear that increasing the Air Force to 70 teams will be considered a threat to the security of the Soviet Union by the Soviet leaders. Circles close to the Air Force believe that if Truman refuses to increase the Air Force to 70 teams, the Air Force leaders will focus the Air Force's strength on long-range military bombers, rather than on electric combat and light bombers, because heavy bombers can carry huge amounts of bombs and fly 1,000 kilometers away.

### Einstein Recovers, Talks to Reporters About Peace

Heavily Criticizes the United Nations

[United Press, New York, 13th] The famous scientist Albert Einstein was admitted to Brooklyn Hospital for abdominal surgery and is scheduled to be discharged today. According to his remarks to reporters, "There is no reason for the East and West to be hostile to each other. What mankind needs now is a sincere desire to actively cooperate, rather than a dangerous militaristic mentality. If there is no determination to pursue world peace, of course there is no way to find that kind of peace. The United Nations has so far failed to solve the Palestine problem, and has thus reduced its prestige. Reckless compromise with power politics will weaken its spiritual position in the world. The United Nations' long delay in allowing Israel to join the organization has greatly damaged its reputation, and that is the reason." Einstein is 69 years old and is famous throughout the world for his research on atomic fission and the invention of the theory of relativity.

### Seeking Permanent Peace in the Holy Land, Rhode Island Negotiations Begin, Israel Telegraphs that the Army Has Been Demobilized

[United Press, Rhode Island, Aldophort, 13th] As representatives from Israel and Egypt prepared to meet here to seek peace, a telegram from Tel Aviv said that the Jewish army had begun to demobilize. This historic meeting, which could resolve the entire Palestinian war, is scheduled to begin at 11:00 a.m. on the 13th in the conference room on the lower floor of the Trus Hotel. The talks will be chaired by UN mediator Ponchi, who said the prospects for the talks were "very optimistic."

The general mood in Tel Aviv is that the Palestinian war is over, and the demobilization of the army and the restoration of the country's peacetime economy are now the time. When the Rhode Island talks began, the general situation was in favor of Israel. The Jewish army has de facto occupied the entire Negev Desert area. An Egyptian brigade is still surrounded by the Farouqa in the northern Negev. The Egyptian army is still being forced to retreat to the narrow coastal area, including the main stronghold of Gaza. The ten members of the Egyptian delegation who arrived here are all soldiers, led by Colonel Aidi, showing that Egypt only considers the current negotiations to be about the situation in the Negev region, and not a general political solution. On the other hand, the Israeli delegation of six people, mostly political figures, is headed by Foreign Secretary Eitan, showing that the Jewish side is concerned about a general political solution so that a permanent peace stage can be reached.

McLaughton hopes that these three suggestions can be merged into a clear plan of action for the Security Council.

[French News Agency, Success Lake, 12th] The Cuban representative to the Security Council will submit a draft resolution on the Indonesian issue on Friday, which is mainly based on the attitude advocated by U.S. Representative Jessup on Tuesday. According to UN observers, the U.S. position is tantamount to accepting the "status quo" created by the Dutch police action.

[French News Agency, Javidia, 13th] Representatives of the Mediation Committee will travel to Bangka Island on the 15th to visit Indonesian Prime Minister Hatta and the other two leaders who are being imprisoned there by the Netherlands.

### French Communist Leader Speaks, A U.S.-Soviet War Can Be Avoided, Heo Offers to Work for Peace

[Central News Agency, Paris, 11th] The French Parliament opened yesterday, and Communist leader Jiaxiang delivered a speech. He not only did not accuse Western imperialism as usual, but also said that a U.S.-Soviet war can be avoided. This is completely contrary to his speech last year attacking the U.S. and French governments. The comments of various newspapers are surprised by Jiaxiang's speech. Is it authorized by the Communist Party or ordered by the Kremlin to make this compromise proposal? Speaker Heliao said that France is qualified to make peaceful efforts to reconcile the United States and the Soviet Union. Responsible people believe that if the government agrees, Heliao will be happy to go to the United States as a special envoy and is also willing to go to the Soviet Union as a representative of the European Union to serve as a bridge between Stalin and Truman.

### The Soviet Union Threatens the Berlin Airlift, Will Conduct Parachute and Shooting Exercises

[United Press, Berlin, 13th] After a period of silence, the Soviet Union resumed its propaganda offensive against Western European countries on the 13th, the developments are as follows: First, the Soviet Union directly took over the movement of all goods between the Soviet zone and the western zone of Berlin.

Bevan Schuman Holds Talks to Reconcile Differences Between Britain and France, The Negotiations for the Alliance of the Three Nordic Countries Break Down

[United Press, London, 13th] French Foreign Minister Schuman arrived here today and will hold a two-day meeting with Foreign Secretary Bevan. They will discuss various international issues, such as the North Atlantic Joint Defense Treaty, Italian colonies, the Middle East, and Germany. The purpose of the Huibei Conference is to stop the increasingly serious differences between British and French policies, and not to reach a final resolution on the above issues.

[United Press, London, 13th] Qualified diplomatic figures said today that negotiations for the conclusion of a joint defense alliance between Sweden, Norway, and Denmark have broken down. Denmark and Norway hope that the three-nation alliance will be linked to the U.S.-led North Atlantic Alliance, but Sweden insists on adopting its traditional policy of neutrality to avoid being involved in disputes between East and West. It is expected that Norway and Denmark will accept the invitation of Western countries within a few weeks to join the North Atlantic Alliance.

### British and American Interests Clash in the Middle East, Forming a Political Standoff; British Opposition Expresses Dissatisfaction with Bevin

[United Press International, Lake Success, 13th] The unity and harmony between the United States and Britain in Palestine appeared to have broken down on the 13th due to the diplomatic struggle between Britain and the Jews. Experienced United Nations diplomats believe that the differences between the United States and Britain over the Holy Land may develop into a political confrontation between the two countries in the entire Middle East region.

This belief was reinforced by reports that Egypt's sudden decision to negotiate peace with Israel was motivated by Egypt's desire to adjust its relations with both countries. An American official said that Egyptian leaders, having long been subjected to direct or indirect British control, were eager to break free from this yoke and establish stronger political and economic ties with the United States, as Britain was promoting a peaceful settlement of the Holy Land that favored Transjordan, while the United States was pressing for an immediate peace that favored Egypt.

[United Press, London, 13th] Government officials declared today after a cabinet meeting that all cabinet members clearly and unanimously supported Foreign Secretary Bevin's policy on Palestine, and that Britain's path in the Middle East would not change. The House of Commons is scheduled to reconvene on the 18th, at which time Bevin is expected to attend and report in detail on the situation in the Middle East.

[United Press, London, 12th] Newspapers here have been criticizing Bevin and his policies. Conservative Party leader Eden said today in Bewick that it was regrettable that British aircraft were flying over the Egyptian-Israeli war zone without purpose. The downing of a British aircraft by Israel was an aggressive attack, but the question is, why was the government sending aircraft to scout the war zone in this situation? Furthermore, the government's policy towards the Middle East may jeopardize Anglo-American relations.

### Rising Prices Threaten Workers' Livelihoods; Trade Union Federation Petitions, Presenting Two Demands; Strikes and Slowdowns Increase; Social Affairs Bureau Orders Strict Prohibition; No Requests to be Processed Until Normalcy is Restored

[Our Own Report] Rising prices are threatening workers' livelihoods. Workers at several factories have been requesting salary advances and rice loans from their employers. According to sources at the Social Affairs Bureau, from the 12th to the afternoon of the 13th, there have been multiple instances of strikes and slowdowns, mostly involving cotton textile workers, including the workers at the China Textile Company's First Textile Factory and the Xinhe Yarn Factory, who stopped work on the night of the 12th. Other factories, such as Xinyu Second Factory, Xinsheng Yarn Factory, China Textile Company's Second, Third, Sixth, and Seventh Factories, China Textile Company's First Ramie Factory, China Textile Company's First and Second Machine Factories, Yong'an Third Factory, and Hongzhang Yarn Factory, have also stopped work. The reasons for the slowdowns are rice loans, salary advances, or cost-of-living index issues. Upon hearing the news, the Social Affairs Bureau immediately dispatched personnel to stop them and order them to resume work before processing their requests.

Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, made the following statement yesterday: "It is indeed a fact that rising prices are threatening the livelihoods of workers, and I deeply sympathize with them. However, as prices rise, so does the cost-of-living index, and the index for the first half of this month will be released soon. It is inappropriate for a small number of workers to engage in unauthorized slowdowns and strikes without following normal procedures. As the Lunar New Year approaches, local security is of utmost importance. Spies are attempting to take advantage of the opportunity to spread rumors, engage in incitement, or incite labor unrest to disrupt social order. During this period of martial law, the government is determined to suppress any actions that undermine public interest and will not allow any conspiracies to succeed. I sincerely hope that the majority of our good workers will not be exploited. If they have any demands, they should follow legal procedures, and the government will make every effort to resolve them. Any unauthorized slowdowns, strikes, or other illegal actions will be handed over to the security authorities for strict punishment in accordance with martial law. No requests will be processed until normalcy is restored."

[Our Own Report] Due to the recent surge in prices, which has greatly threatened the livelihoods of workers, the Municipal Trade Union Federation decided at a joint meeting of its directors and supervisors that yesterday morning, the chairman, Wen Xuexiang, along with the secretary, Liang Yongjun, standing supervisor Ye Xianggao, and over a dozen others, would petition the Social Affairs Bureau, where they were personally received by Director Wu. The representatives stated the difficult circumstances workers were facing due to the threat of high prices and presented two requests: (1) They hoped that the authorities would take effective measures to address the rising prices as soon as possible. (2) The compilation of the cost-of-living index should be improved, and the price surveys should be absolutely accurate. In the food item of the index, in addition to calculating two dou (a unit of measurement) of rice at the priority ration price, the remaining five dou and nine sheng should be calculated at market price. Director Wu expressed his deep sympathy for the difficulties faced by workers and stated that the government was determined to suppress prices. He hoped that workers could assist, and if any factories or stores engaged in illegal price gouging, he hoped that workers would help report them. Regarding the compilation of the index, Director Wu stated that it was absolutely accurate. As for the request to change the calculation of the rice price, he agreed to submit it to the Price Index Review Committee for research.

[Another Report] Zhou and others also visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government yesterday morning, requesting that the authorities take effective measures to curb the drastically fluctuating prices as soon as possible. As Mayor Wu was on sick leave, Secretary-General Shen received them and agreed to relay their request to the Mayor for review.

### Over Two Hundred Faculty and Staff at Fudan University Cable the Ministry of Education, Urging Improved Treatment; Salaries Only Increased Fivefold, Making it Difficult to Maintain Livelihoods

[Our Own Report] He Dehe and 278 other faculty and staff members of the National Fudan University jointly cabled the Ministry of Education, appealing for improved treatment. The telegram stated, "Since the government's financial and price policies have repeatedly changed, prices in Shanghai have soared more than fortyfold in the past four months, while the monthly salaries of our colleagues are only five times the salary at the time of currency reform (six times including the increment). This meager amount makes it difficult to maintain a livelihood. At present, our colleagues have pawned everything and have no way to borrow money. As a last resort, we appeal to your Ministry and request the following two measures to improve living conditions: (1) Please adjust the salaries of our colleagues every half month according to the Shanghai Municipal Workers' Cost of Living Index. (2) At this time of turmoil, our colleagues are at risk of running out of food at any time. Please pre-pay three months' salary to meet our emergency needs. Looking back, the proposal to reorganize the Executive Yuan of the government has been under discussion for over a month. During this period, the issue of the living treatment of public school teachers nationwide has neither been shelved nor forgotten by the government. Now that the new cabinet has been formed, we hereby propose the above suggestions for improving the living conditions of our colleagues. We earnestly request your prompt approval, for which we will be immensely grateful. Respectfully presented to the Ministry of Education."

### Rice Ration Prices to be Adjusted Regularly; Mayor Wu Explains Difficulties; Two Potential Problems with Ration Prices Being Too Low; "No Adjustment This Month" Cannot Be Guaranteed

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday at 5:00 PM, Mayor Wu, despite being ill, received reporters at the Municipal Government and solemnly announced that household rice ration prices will be adjusted regularly according to market prices in the future. He stated that recently, there have been various rumors regarding whether the ration rice prices will be adjusted from time to time. This is a matter of great concern to the citizens, so he specifically explained it in hopes of gaining the citizens' understanding. The decision to adjust the rice ration prices from time to time was made by the Economic Coordination Committee, which is jointly composed of the Executive Yuan, the U.S. Aid Materials Utilization Committee, and the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration's China Branch. The committee will decide how and when to adjust the ration rice prices in the future. As the chairman of the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee, he wholeheartedly supports this decision of the central government. He knows that citizens prefer to eat cheap rice and do not welcome high-priced rice. However, the most important task of the government at present is to replenish the rice supply. The citizens should not have forgotten the painful rice shortage in November of last year. If the rice ration prices are too low, there may be two potential problems: (1) U.S. aid rice and foreign rice are calculated in U.S. dollars, so their prices are higher. Therefore, if cheap ration rice is to be supplied, unless the government has endless U.S. aid and the national treasury can subsidize it, but in reality, U.S. aid and the national treasury are limited. Therefore, the cost of ration rice is high, and the rice funds obtained decrease over time, which weakens the government's ability to purchase rice, affecting the ration rice quantity and gradually reducing it until the ration rice policy cannot be sustained. (2) The rate of increase in rice prices and commodity prices is originally the same. If the ration price is too low, then rural rice will be unwilling to come to the city, and urban rice will be unwilling to be sold. Sixty-three percent of the total ration rice quantity in this city must be supplied by the central government from its own sources, and 37 percent relies on external sources. Therefore, the price of ration rice cannot be too low.

Citizens Eagerly Rush to Purchase; Considered a Good Phenomenon

Regarding the news report that the ration rice prices will not be adjusted this month, it is actually incorrect and must be corrected. However, he does not know when the adjustment will be made because the committee will adjust it according to actual needs. After this decision is implemented, it is expected that citizens will rush to purchase rice at the rice stores. He believes that this is also a good phenomenon because in the past, citizens only went to buy at the end of the month. When the government received the funds, it was unable to purchase more rice due to rising commodity prices. Now, citizens are rushing to purchase, and the government can obtain the rice funds early and hand them over to the Emergency Storage and Purchase Committee for immediate purchase, so it will not suffer losses. Mayor Wu concluded that in today's world, food is the first priority. Therefore, making the rice supply abundant is the most urgent task. He hopes that the people can cooperate with the government, understand the government's difficulties, and understand the government's intentions.

Unscrupulous Rice Stores Refuse to Sell; People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee Investigating Thoroughly

Regarding citizens discovering that rice stores are refusing to sell ration rice, Mayor Wu stated yesterday that they can report directly to the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee. He said that a few unscrupulous rice stores have been found in this city to be refusing to sell ration rice, and the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee is thoroughly investigating. The People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee distributes an average of 30,000 to 40,000 dan of rice to various rice stores every day, so the above situation should not occur.

Furthermore, the director of the Distribution Department of the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee stated yesterday that the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee is only an operational organization and not a decision-making organization. It usually manages the distribution of rice and the distribution of rice certificates.

December Key Certificates Can Be Used as Replacements

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the People's Food Allocation Committee, the key ration rice certificates for private primary and secondary school teachers and staff and their families, as well as journalists and their families, for January, will be replaced by the key ration rice certificates for industrial workers for December 1948. The People's Food Allocation Office has notified all district commissioners to inspect and distribute rice certificate samples and to instruct all rice stores that those holding the above ration certificates can still purchase rice as usual.

Ration Rice Has Not Yet Been Distributed; Citizens Express Deep Concern

Furthermore, since the news of the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee's plan to adjust ration rice prices at any time was announced, citizens have been rushing to purchase household rice from various rice stores to avoid being affected by price increases. However, some rice stores claim that the ration rice has not yet been delivered, or that only whole rice is available and broken rice has not yet been delivered, making it impossible to sell. Amid these rumors of ration rice prices being adjusted at any time, the general public is becoming even more concerned. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that the district commissioners will adjust the situation at any time so that rice can be sold as soon as possible in order to maintain the people's livelihood.

Except for the 45th car white essence, which was slightly firm in the soft stall, the prices of other white, red, cotton, and Hainan sea salt were slightly reduced by a few yuan.

### Tung Oil Swings

The tung oil market trend remained in a sticky state yesterday, and the market was consistent and unchanged. The reason is that the monetary policy seems loose and tight, and there is no enthusiastic practical demand from all parties, so the seller wants to raise prices but cannot, and it eventually presents a swing situation. Judging from this situation, it is feared that there will be few trips for the time being.

### Keelung Ships Gather, Coal Loading Difficulties in Taiwan

Fuel in this city has been extremely scarce for several months. The stock of diesel is low, and the authorities are allocating it to factories, temporarily reducing supply by 20%. To solve the coal shortage, the Central Coal Allocation Office plans to ship 88,000 tons of coal to Shanghai this month, including 66,000 tons of Taiwanese coal, with the remainder being Soviet and American coal. As of now, no Taiwanese coal has arrived in Shanghai. This is due to the congestion of ships in export ports such as Keelung in Taiwan, making loading and unloading difficult, and the grounding of ships due to workers demanding adjustments to the porterage fees.

It is also learned that if all 66,000 tons arrive this month, the allocation method will be: (1) 32,000 tons for public utilities, and (2) 24,000 tons for factories, power companies, and other users.

### Woolen Fabric Prices Rise

Woolen fabric sales have become quiet at the end of the lunar year, but prices have risen. Yesterday, a piece of presentable fancy woolen robe material was generally priced at over 5,000 yuan. A complete set of Western-style clothing was priced at around 7,000 yuan. Printed cotton lining silk was wholesaled at 100 yuan per yard, German salt-grey soft lining at 50 yuan, waterproof cloth at 160 yuan, and Weiyi overcoat woolen fabric at 1,900 yuan.

### National Bank Organizes Emergency Salt Loans

The Huai salt production areas have successively fallen, and Sichuan salt is again in a state of suspension. In order to regulate military and civilian food needs, the government has decided to implement emergency salt loans. The Central Bank's rediscount committee is drafting the measures. This emergency salt loan is mainly for rushing shipments of Taiwanese and Qingdao salt, and for restoring and increasing Sichuan salt production. The total loan amount is 40 million yuan. 20 million yuan is for rushing shipments of Taiwanese and Qingdao salt, and another 20 million yuan is for Sichuan salt production expenses. The task of rushing shipments of Taiwanese and Qingdao salt will be entrusted to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications for lending, with a target of shipping 500,000 piculs, with a loan of 40 yuan per picul. However, the current salt price is actually around 300 yuan per picul, which is far from the actual needs. Moreover, due to transportation difficulties and poor logistics, salt merchants are unwilling to use these loans to avoid taking risks and suffering unexpected losses.

### Machine-Made Nail Industry: Production and Sales Decline Sharply Daily

According to the Shanghai Industrial Association, the current situation of the machine-made nail industry in this city is as follows:

Initially, there were only three companies: China, Wufu, and Gongjin. Currently, there are more than 70 member factories. The main products of each factory are 1-inch to 3-inch round nails and 18-gauge to 8-gauge iron wire. Other major products include shoe nails, galvanized iron wire, machine screws, wood screws, and barbed wire. Currently, the main equipment of each factory includes 700 nail-making machines, 880 wire-drawing machines, 178 shoe nail machines, 235 wood screw machines, 35 machine screw machines, 58 galvanized iron wire machines, 11 barbed wire machines, 492 electric motors, and 5 generators. The main raw materials required for the nail-making industry are iron wire and wire rod. However, the raw materials required for galvanized iron wire, in addition to wire rod, also require an average of 10 jin of zinc ingots per picul of finished product. In the past, the domestic production of iron wire and wire rod was extremely low, relying entirely on foreign supplies. Currently, the monthly production of the No. 2 factory of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company can reach more than 800 tons, and the monthly production of wire rod by the other 20 iron and steel factories is also more than 1,000 tons. Wood screws and machine screws are divided into steel and iron types, and each gross requires an average of about 5 jin of wire rod and steel wire. At its peak, the total output of each factory could reach 100,000 barrels of round nails, 20,000 boxes of shoe nails, 20,000 piculs of iron wire, 20,000 piculs of galvanized iron wire, 40,000 gross of machine screws, 220,000 gross of wood screws, and 30,000 rolls of barbed wire per month. In addition to supplying this city and the whole country, 40% could be sold to Southeast Asia. Currently, due to price fluctuations, high wages, and difficulties in importing raw materials, costs have increased sharply. At the same time, industry and commerce are generally shrinking, and people's purchasing power is weak. Production and sales are declining sharply every day, and the future of the industry is not optimistic.

### New Equipment for Basketball League: Electric Scorer Completed, Scoring Fully Electrically Controlled, To Be Used in This League

[Reported by this newspaper] The fourth basketball league will open next week. The floor of the city stadium has been repaired and completely repainted. In terms of lighting, 21 strong spotlights have also been newly added, entrusted to the Experimental Film Studio for installation, and the hot water showers have also been installed. Among them, the most important new equipment is the completion of the basketball electric scorer. The scorer includes three parts: electric scoring, electric timing, and electric lighting. It is fully electrically controlled, requiring only one person to manage, completely eliminating the past manual scoring and manual timing, and is extremely accurate, which is a major creation and innovation in Chinese sports equipment. The design of the scorer was conceived by Qian Xucang, chairman of the Shanghai City Sports Association Basketball Committee, and fully refined with the assistance of the LB Laboratory (i.e., Li Brothers Laboratory) in this city. In the past, Mr. Qian made many innovations to basketball equipment in this city, and created a jumping basketball timer, which was adopted in the basketball finals of the 7th National Games, with excellent results. Last autumn, he went to England to visit the World Games, and also traveled to the United States for study and investigation, gaining more insights into basketball. The completion of this electric scorer can be said to be a great success. The manufacturing cost of the machine is very high, and it was jointly donated by the enthusiastic Zhengtai Rubber Factory and ABC Candy Company. The contents of the machine are as follows: (1) Scoring section - the letters are clear, controlled by electric buttons, and no longer need to be manually turned over. (2) Timing section - made of a giant electric clock, with white characters on a black background, the minute hand rotates once every 20 minutes (i.e., half of the A-level game time), the second hand still rotates once every 60 seconds, and is calculated by countdown, the position where the clock hand stops is the remaining time of the game for quick observation. (3) Lighting section - specially installed on the inner edge of the electric clock, the light is not dazzling, the clock face emits red light when paused, and the clock face emits green light when running. This kind of light can represent signals and also make the clock face clear. Other indications such as the upper and lower halves are also clearly displayed on the machine.

### Nanshi Football Match: Qingbai Lineup Subpar, Huaguang Wins by Four Goals

The Huaguang team, with its tireless efforts, quick actions, and delicate cooperation, overwhelmed the Qingbai team by four to zero yesterday, winning enthusiastic support from over a thousand spectators in the entire stadium. This is a surprising feat in this season's Nanshi League. Qingbai's unprecedented beating, rather than being attributed to complacency, is better described as hitting an unlucky time. Any strong team is bound to suffer one or two unexpected setbacks in its development process. Even the experienced Meng Yiliang could only shake his head and vent his frustration yesterday. The poor Qingbai lineup was the biggest reason for the disastrous defeat.

Match Overview

The entire Huaguang team played well. The forward line was impeccable, and the defense line had few mistakes. Wu Qiqi, in the center, was the most hardworking and meritorious, providing supplies and taking care of the defense. Chen Huimin's goalkeeping and the left and right wings, Zhu Jiaheng and Shang Shiqi, were also outstanding talents. As for Qingbai, encountering an unlucky time, their footwork was naturally mostly unfavorable, which can be put aside.

At 3:10, Qingbai kicked off. The ball was intercepted by Huaguang, and right wing Shang Shiqi advanced along the side and hooked the ball, which was immediately shot in by Qian Yunqing, less than a minute after the start of the game. Qingbai's counterattack was ineffective, and Huaguang was active again, but all were blocked by Qingbai's defense line. The two sides held each other in stalemate for over 20 minutes. Both sides played many exciting moments, and cheers were endless. At 24 minutes, Huaguang launched an attack on the left, and Zhu Jiaheng's long shot was again successful. This ball was more urgent and powerful than the first, and even more beautiful. In less than four minutes, Wu Qixiang took the lead and went to the front line to shoot, unexpectedly breaking through the goal and creating an absolute advantage of three to zero.

At the start of the second half, Qingbai tried hard to take the offensive in order to recover, but unfortunately, they were too hasty, and their shots often went against their wishes. In a short while, Huaguang's forward line was like a dragon and a tiger, frequently advancing into Qingbai's hinterland. At 13 minutes, Huaguang's Zhu Jiaheng launched a rebellion on the border, dribbling the ball and dashing forward, deceiving Jiang Zhenning and shooting from 25 yards away. The ball was high and powerful, and it penetrated the net from the upper right corner of the goal near the crossbar, extremely beautiful. Chen Keming had no other choice but to watch it go in. Huaguang won a total of four goals. At this point, Qingbai really felt that they could not turn the tide. Even in the last ten minutes, Meng Yiliang went forward alone, chasing the ball. The opponent's defender had already been deceived, and even goalkeeper Chen Huimin had left his position, leaving an empty goal waiting to kiss Meng Yiliang. But he kicked a high ball, which crossed the fence and went wild. What is this if not fate? As a result, four to zero, Qingbai retreated. The lineups of the two armies are listed below.

### The Road to Construction in Sichuan Province

— This newspaper reporter, Zhou Xueduan

[This newspaper, Chengdu, 10th (airmail)] The construction projects in Sichuan today can generally include the following: namely, railways, industry and mining, highways, and rural areas. Each has active construction plans and practices. The current status of what has been explored is summarized as follows:

Tianshui-Chengdu Railway to Start Construction Soon

The Tianshui-Chengdu Railway has been surveyed by the Ministry of Transportation Engineering Team for half a year and is now completed. The entire route starts 30 miles west of Tianshui, passes through Mudandong, Yanguan, Lianghekou, and follows the Jialing River to Guangyuan, Jiangyou, Mianyang, and Guanghan to Chengdu. The project cost has been budgeted by the Ministry of Communications and will request a portion of the U.S. aid for subsidies. Construction will begin this month.

Developing Industry and Mining, Dividing into Four Zones

The Sichuan Provincial Government, in order to develop industry and mining, has recently divided the entire province into four mining areas and is actively engaged in development. They are: (1) the Weiyuan area, including 15 counties in Zigong, Leshan, and Zizhong; (2) the Luxian area, including 14 counties in Ningbin, Jiangjin, and Nanxi; (3) the Chongqing area, including 23 counties in Jiangbei, Nanguang, and Tongliang; (4) the Wanxian area, including 17 counties in Yunchang, Chengkou, and Wuxi. Actively develop special products separately.

Chengdu-Chongqing Railway: Project Commences

The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was previously stalled due to the completion of the appropriation of funds. The Yuyong section must wait until the flood season next spring before all the equipment purchased in the United States arrives before the track-laying project can begin. The Yutong section is currently actively carrying out earthwork engineering. If no obstacles occur along the way, the entire line should be open to traffic in July next year.

Revitalizing Rural Areas, Developing Special Products

The Sichuan Provincial Government, in order to revitalize the rural areas of Sichuan and develop special products, has recently proposed a new rural construction plan for Sichuan, deciding on three principles: (1) In the first phase, promote miscellaneous grains in the western Sichuan Plain, Jianyang American tobacco, Santai cotton, Leshan white wax, Zinei sugar, Kai County tung oil, and Sichuan lovage, angelica, fritillary, and other medicinal materials in Shizhu and other counties. (2) Establish the Sichuan Rural Revitalization Committee. (3) Raise funds according to the U.S. aid percentage of 65%, the central government 15%, and the local 20%.

Three Major Highways: Emergency Repairs

The Sichuan Provincial Government, in order to protect Sichuan's defense, is urgently repairing three major national defense highways. The construction progress is as follows: (1) Mianlue Highway. After emergency repairs, the entire road has been barely opened to traffic. Basic permanent engineering is being undertaken by the Sichuan Highway Bureau, which is mobilizing civil workers for construction. After the Chongqing-Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters sent an inspection team to supervise the repairs, it has requested the central government to subsidize funds and complete the entire road within a time limit. (2) Chengdu-Bazhong Highway. Step up emergency repairs. Each county along the road, Jintang, Yilong, and Bazhong, mobilize hundreds of thousands of civil workers to work day and night. If the basic engineering costs subsidized by the central government are quickly allocated in the short term, the entire road can be completed as scheduled. (3) Dachuan-Guang'an Highway. Although emergency repairs have been carried out day and night, the central government has only subsidized 50,000 yuan, and the progress of the project has been greatly delayed.

Sichuan-Yunnan Railway to Resume Work Immediately

The Ministry of Transportation believes that the Sichuan-Yunnan Railway is related to the future of construction in the Great Southwest. Due to actual needs, it has decided to resume work in the short term. The route runs from Zhan Yi in Yunnan to Longchang in Sichuan, with a total length of more than 600 kilometers. The roadbed has been completed long ago. The Ministry of Transportation is currently ordering a large number of steel rails, steel frames, and other materials in the United States for the resumption of the road. The required sleepers will be purchased locally in Sichuan and Yunnan. The start of construction is near. The Ministry of Transportation has telegraphed the Sichuan Provincial Government to request assistance.

### Details of the Natong "Mix Rice and Hoard" Case

— This newspaper reporter, Cong Yongshu

[This newspaper, Nantong, 10th] Ever since Nantong's rice became inextricably linked to cotton yarn, the common people have been complaining. The current ratio of rice to yarn is as follows: one picul of good white rice can be exchanged for two and a half small bags of Hongkui yarn of 20 counts produced by Dasheng Yarn Factory, and a slightly inferior grade can also be exchanged for two small bags. As a result, the yarn rose, and the rice also rose. However, when the yarn fell, the rice stood still. The rice price rigidly stipulated in the economic meeting of the Command Headquarters Economic Office on New Year's Eve has long become a dead letter. Rice is an indispensable food, and such a crazy price increase directly threatens people's livelihood.

Rice Store Doors Blown Open

Under this situation, the "mixing rice and hoarding" incident occurred successively in Tangzha Town, northwest of the county seat. The process of the matter is as follows: a small number of workers at the Dasheng Yarn Factory had a conflict with rice merchants over buying rice. The next day, at 6 o'clock in the morning on the 9th, when the night shift workers were dismissed, the workers gathered and blew open the rice store, mixing various foods: rice, wheat, soybeans, flour, etc. together. In the chaos, there were also incidents of destroying business equipment. The extension lasted about two or three hours before it subsided. As a result, Zhen Tai, Heng Yi Gong, and other two companies suffered long losses, and one female worker was injured at the time.

Tragic Event Reenacted

At 6 o'clock in the morning on the 10th, the "mixing rice and hoarding" incident was reenacted. The situation was even more expanded than before. This time, several companies had their doors blown open, including Daxinglong, Zhentai, Wanfengde, Dingtai, Hengyigong, etc. Because some grain stores also operated oil businesses, Dingtai and Hengyigong were oil and rice factories, so rice was mixed with wheat, wheat was mixed with flour, the old drama was repeated, and the new trick was to immerse flour, rice, and cotton yarn in oil tanks. A business on the upper floor hoarded about three boxes of cotton yarn, which was also thrown from the upper floor to the center of the street in small bags. The agitators on the road also broke up the small bags and threw them into the air, so the eaves and wires were covered with scattered cotton yarn. A part of the people also broke into the oil workshop, destroying the machines, and the furniture of the other three families was also destroyed in the same way, completely dismantled.

Squad Leader Zhang Hit

At this time, the situation was extremely chaotic. The Self-Defense Force fired warning shots, but the agitators rushed towards the team members, and under the combined force of fists and feet, a Mauser pistol was lost. The team members shouted, "There is no gun, what are you still fighting for?" Zhang, the squad leader of the Self-Defense Force, was unable to maintain order. During the commotion, a rioter hit him on the head with a stick, breaking his skull and immediately fainting. He was rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment. Gu Yuanru, the director of the Tangzha Construction Experimental Zone, rushed to the scene of the incident to persuade him, but was wiped on the nose several times by the rioting crowd in the chaos and was unable to speak. The riot on the 10th started at 6 am and did not completely subside until noon. In addition to some Dasheng workers, a small number of pedestrians also participated in the mixing and hoarding.

Avoid Reoccurring Incidents

After the incident, the Tangzha Experimental Zone Office, the police branch, and the Dasheng Trade Union held a meeting to persuade the workers to resolve the matter. At the same time, the Grain and Vegetable Guild also held a meeting to change the rice price. Some said that when the workers bought rice, the first batch was quoted at 2,800 yuan per picul, but when the second batch arrived, the quote reached 3,200 yuan per picul, with a very short interval, but the price difference was huge, causing the workers to be indignant and take this action. However, the person in charge of the Grain Association said that there was no such high price. On the 9th, the Tangzha Grain Market quoted 2,400 yuan per picul for white rice and 2,000 yuan per picul for Xian rice. On the 10th, in order to avoid reoccurring incidents, they reduced the price by 100 yuan each, with white rice at 2,300 yuan and Xian rice at 1,900 yuan.

However, the aftermath of this "hoarding" case is still under consideration, but Zhang, the squad leader of the Self-Defense Force who was beaten, died of his injuries in the afternoon!

### Zhenjiang Cracks Down on Communist Aid Case, People and Guns Taken to Police Station

[This newspaper, Zhenjiang, 12th] The Provincial Capital Police Department cracked a major suspected Communist aid case on the 11th. A civilian ship, which had sailed from Bao Ying to the river surface of the Riverside Park in Zhenjiang at the beginning of the month, was found to be abnormal by the local sentry police, who reported to the General Administration to dispatch a large number of police officers to search.

### Hua Zhong Pacification Headquarters Political Committee Orders: Emergency Handling Measures for Recovered Area Farmland

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 9th] In order to prevent land disputes and stabilize social order as the pacification military operations progress, the Political Committee of the Hua Zhong Pacification Headquarters, based on the regulations of the Pacification Zone Land Handling Measures and considering local conditions, has formulated an "Emergency Handling Measures for Recovered Area Farmland," which has been ordered to be promulgated to the provincial and municipal governments within its jurisdiction. The regulations stipulate: (1) Once a county or city territory is recovered, the local government should immediately establish a County (City) Township Land Rights Mediation Committee to mediate disputes concerning land rights.

### Famous Scholar, Good Principal: Zhu Kezhen Takes on a Heavy Burden

— Our Correspondent Chu Yusheng

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 8th] Zhejiang University is often considered one of the most prestigious institutions of higher learning in the country. I have chatted with many professors and students at the university, and they all unanimously admire their principal. Principal Zhu Kezhen is an academician of the Academia Sinica, a renowned meteorologist, short in stature, and of a lean appearance.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Mr. Zhu Kezhen led thousands of students from Zhejiang across mountains and rivers to the remote southwestern rear area. In Zunyi, Guizhou, with its overlapping mountains and rugged roads, he endured hardship and set an example, sharing joys and sorrows with professors and students. Although the school buildings were dilapidated and the clothes were tattered, "Zhejiang University" still maintained unparalleled brilliance.

When in Zunyi, Mr. Zhu, in addition to handling school administration, often chatted with the students in his spare time, asking about their studies, asking about their lives, and sometimes chatting with the school workers and doormen about their families. Although they spent their hard years during the war, they were greatly encouraged in spirit by Mr. Zhu's concern.

Mr. Zhu is not interested in politics. On the contrary, he particularly respects cultural workers. I remember during the Qiannan Incident, when cultural figures were evacuated from Guiyang, via Zunyi, to Chongqing, he always personally visited their residences and helped solve their food and accommodation problems. He also invited them to give speeches to the students and held banquets to entertain them, even in impoverished conditions.

He runs education from the standpoint of a pure scholar, treating the university as an academic research institution. With "scholarship" as the primary premise, the students of Zunyi "Zhejiang University" sought their truths in books and laboratories. The students' nearsightedness increased, and so did the reputation of Zhejiang University.

After the victory of the War of Resistance, Mr. Zhu led them again across mountains and rivers, adding to the beautiful scenery of Hangzhou. He still often chats with the students, and still chats with the school workers and doormen about their families. However, constant warfare and the difficulty of running the school make this person who runs education from the standpoint of a pure scholar feel unprecedentedly thorny due to worries about the times and affairs.

Scholarship is about questioning, and scholarship is vast. Therefore, the attitude of scholars is sincere and generous. Precisely because of this, the government blames him for favoritism, and the students blame him for weakness. He once told me, "I don't understand politics, and I don't know how to engage in politics. It makes me very difficult now, so I really want to resign." The students are finally naive. From wall newspapers, speeches, and even actions, they all earnestly retain their "good principal"! He was moved to tears by the familiarity of these thousands of students. He re-shouldered this difficult burden and led the students forward!

After the Huaihai Campaign, schools in Nanjing suspended classes invisibly, and universities in Shanghai started their holidays early. In Peiping and Tianjin, after the "deserter" Hu Shi flew to Beijing, it is unknown how these thousands of outstanding talents are struggling in the flames of war. With the same nostalgia and the same feelings, I went to "Zhejiang University" for a stroll on a morning with a temperature of four degrees below zero and a biting cold wind.

Principal Zhu received me in his office. He was wearing a well-worn woolen coat. He was studying a certain subject. With a sad feeling, he told me, "Recently, the school's financial situation has become worse, and we can't even afford to light a fire." He continued, "The average salary of professors is only 700 Gold Yuan per person, which, according to today's (January 8th) market price, can only buy one dan of rice. If a professor has a wife and two children, how can they survive? It seems that prices will continue to rise! Fortunately, Chairman Chen of Zhejiang Province provides seven dou of rice to university professors, so we can barely maintain. However, under these circumstances, we are very concerned about whether Chairman Chen can continue to provide rations? The school's total office expenses are only 12,000 Gold Yuan. The electricity bill for November was 120,000 Gold Yuan, and the bill for December will probably be even higher. How can the school administration be maintained?"

Mr. Zhu has many feelings about national affairs: "Since India was recognized as independent by Britain, there have been internal rifts. However, they have already canceled their antagonistic attitudes. Recently, they convened an Asian conference in New Delhi to discuss the Dutch-Indonesian dispute. Aren't the suffering of our Chinese professors and the suffering of the people all caused by the civil war?"

I then asked him about contingency plans, and he said, "We have not suspended classes due to the tense situation. We plan to start the final exams in mid-January, followed by a three-week winter vacation. Students who fail will have to take make-up exams, which will probably take two weeks. Therefore, excellent students can have a three-week break, while students who fail will only have a one-week break. The school has no plans to move. The Ministry of Education has not given instructions, and moving the school is not an easy task."

Of course, it is clear from this conversation with him that his burden is even heavier. But I also have a new impression of him, which is that he does not compromise in the face of difficulties, and he hates war. In fact, all true scholars are probably like that!
