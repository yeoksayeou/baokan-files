### Continued Peace Talks in Beiping: River Crossing Issue Remains Central Point of Discussion. Huang Shao-hong Didn't Return to Nanjing Yesterday; Yu Youren Postpones Trip North

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The peace talks continue in Beiping. Huang Shao-hong has not returned to Nanjing as of the 15th. He telegraphed here in the afternoon of the 15th, stating that meetings continued on the 14th and 15th, and several issues have not yet been agreed upon. He also expressed his hope that Yu Youren would wait for his return to Nanjing to exchange views before flying to Beiping. However, it was not known as of the evening of the 15th whether Mr. Huang could return to Nanjing on the 16th. It is rumored that the reason for Mr. Huang's delay may be that the opinions recently brought by the government encountered some difficulties after being presented, causing the peace talks that had already begun to be hindered, making it impossible to reach a concrete conclusion for reference. According to reports, Mr. Huang had originally decided to return to Nanjing on the 15th. When Zhang Zhizhong spoke to this place on the phone on the morning of the 15th, he stated that Mr. Huang would come to Nanjing in the afternoon, but this did not happen. Therefore, people in Nanjing have some concerns about this.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Just as Yu Youren and his entourage were ready to depart, they suddenly received a phone call from Zhang Zhizhong on the morning of the 15th, requesting that they wait until after Huang Shao-hong arrived in Nanjing for a meeting before starting their journey, thus delaying the trip. Mr. Yu held two meetings with his entourage at his official residence on the morning and evening of the 15th, discussing some details. When Mr. Yu met with reporters late at night on the 15th, he could not give a definite statement on his departure date, but since the 17th is his seventy-first birthday, he could not leave on the 16th and might postpone it until after the 17th. Furthermore, it has recently been decided to add Supervisory Committee member Wang Xinling to the list of those flying with Mr. Yu.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Reliable sources revealed on the 15th regarding the progress and key issues of the peace talks, saying that the eight conditions used as the basis are no longer an obstacle to the peace talks. Conversely, the issue of President Chiang's whereabouts and the crossing of the Yangtze River by the communist army are the most difficult and urgent preconditions that need to be resolved. It is said that the communist side believes that although President Chiang has retired, his potential power is still very strong. Therefore, the current deployment of the national army and the cooperation of the authorities still appear to involve President Chiang's participation in command. During the peace talks, in order to reduce obstacles to the peace talks, the issue of President Chiang's whereabouts should be studied. As for the issue of crossing the Yangtze River, the communist side believes that in order to ensure peace talks, the communist army must cross the Yangtze River, which has a military significance and is related to order in the rear, especially pointing out the condition of "rampant secret agents in the rear." They have studied ways of crossing the river, intending to abandon armed attacks and take a peaceful crossing. The government feels quite troubled by the above two difficulties, because President Chiang's whereabouts were announced when he announced his retirement, and he has retired to his hometown of Xikou, repeatedly expressing that he does not interfere in politics. It is now clear that he is not personally handling and commanding military and political affairs. Regarding the crossing of the Yangtze River, the government has long believed that crossing the river would affect the peace talks. If the communist army crosses the river, it will be easily threatened when resolving various issues. The government delegation has been negotiating with the communist representatives based on this attitude, but has not yet reached a conclusion or any concessions. Some pessimistic people are very worried about this. After thorough discussions on the eight conditions between the government representatives and the communist representatives, the standards have been greatly relaxed. The communist side no longer insists on the issue of war criminals, but the phrase "investigate war responsibility" must be included when the peace treaty is established in the future. Regarding legitimacy, the Republic of China has been recognized as the legal name for the future. According to authoritative sources, the communist side in principle does not allow changes to the eight conditions, that is, the conditions must exist, but the content can have the maximum degree of flexibility to reduce difficulties. It is rumored that during the pre-meeting exchange of views, Zhang Zhizhong's first four-hour conversation with Mao Zedong on the 8th was the most important. As of now, the central government's attitude is still within the scope of the decisions made during the negotiations on the 8th.

### Differing Opinions on North-South Navigation; Legislative Yuan to Discuss Again Today; Ministry of Economic Affairs Revises Plan for North-South Exchange of Goods

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The North-South Navigation Proposal submitted by Legislator Li Yunliang was brought up for discussion at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the afternoon of the 15th. First, Legislator Li explained the main points of the proposal, stating that the proposal for navigation has five reasons: to relieve people's livelihood, protect navigation rights, save foreign exchange, facilitate postal services, and adapt to the situation. The most important thing is that this proposal is an urgent measure to solve the current financial and economic crisis. Currently, the north has surplus coal, salt, soybeans, peanuts, cooking oil, fertilizer, cotton, caustic soda, cement, and other industrial raw materials that can be supplied to the south, while the south has surplus tea, sugar, cigarettes, matches, and industrial products that also need the northern market. This requires navigation to connect them. Since January, ten ships, including "Da Shanghai" and "Tangshan," have transported coal from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai without any malfeasance. However, because shipping lines from Shanghai to Tianjin and other ports have not yet opened, many foreign ships are taking over our navigation rights. Mr. Li also clarified the general belief that "navigation should not be opened before peace is achieved," and he believes that the Communist Party also has the sincerity to open navigation. After Mr. Li's report, Chen Guyuan, Sun Guiji, Zou Shuwen, and others spoke, all strongly emphasizing the necessity of navigation and supporting Mr. Li's proposal. However, some people also submitted written opinions against it. The meeting adjourned at 3:15 p.m. without a result and is scheduled to be brought up for discussion and voting again on the 16th.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs has revised the plan for the exchange of goods between the north and the south again and has decided to start with a small number of goods for trial implementation, exchanging flour for coal, yarn for cotton, and cigarettes for tobacco leaves. After the trial implementation has good results, the scope of exchange will be expanded. In addition to merchants handling it themselves, the China Trust Bureau can also participate. The port for the exchange will still be limited to Tianjin, and ships will be reviewed by the Ministry of Communications. This method will be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion and decision.

[Central News Agency, this city] Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Chinese National Products Merchants Federation, previously jointly telegraphed the central authorities regarding the exchange of goods between the north and the south, making some suggestions. Yesterday, he received a reply from Guo Jinwu, the central representative in Beiping, which said, "To President Xiaolai of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Factory Federation, Director Du Yuesheng of the Shipowners Association, President Liu Hongsheng of the General Industrial Association, and Mr. Wei Wenhan: I have received your message with respect. Protecting national industry and commerce is the established policy of the liberated areas. If the goods traveling between Tianjin and Shanghai can be proven to be domestic products, the authorities will approve the exemption of import and export taxes to facilitate exchange. I hereby reply, Guo Jinwu bows respectfully."

### The Three Legislators Going to Beiping are Purely a Private Trip; Tong Guanxian Announced at the Legislative Yuan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Regarding the matter of Legislator Li Yaolin and others sending a letter to President Tong, President Tong replied at the 14th meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 15th. Regarding the issue of the attitude of legislators' speeches, Mr. Tong said: We came to Nanjing for a meeting with the aim of seeking unity and striving for peace. I hope that all members will unite in the spirit of sharing the same boat. As for the speeches of each member, everyone has freedom and cannot be stopped. As for the report that the Legislative Yuan selected three people to participate in the peace talks, it is not true. This time, President Yu's trip to Beiping is in a private capacity, and the accompanying legislators were also privately invited by Mr. Yu. I did not participate in any opinions. The three legislators are also going in a private capacity and do not represent the Legislative Yuan.

### More Than 100 Legislators Sent a Letter to President Tong, Requesting Effective Maintenance of Order in the Meeting Place

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Legislators Li Yaolin, Yang Gongda, Wu Yanhuan, Song Yishan, Shao Jingren, Liu Zhendong, and more than 100 others, because of the speech of a certain member when the 12th meeting of this month discussed the arrest of members Xu Kaitian and Jin Shaoxian, was sternly stopped by one or two members, and at the same time, a chorus of boos arose in the meeting place, and the newspaper reported that the Legislative Yuan selected three colleagues to participate in the peace talks, specially sent a letter to President Tong on the 14th, making some suggestions and inquiries. The letter was presented to President Tong in person on the 15th. The original text is as follows: "President Guanxian, in today's situation where the country is in turmoil and danger, the colleagues of this Yuan will not evade their responsibilities to the country and the nation. The enthusiasm of the number of people reporting to this session, the tension of the mood, and the establishment of important proposals can all be clear evidence that the colleagues are doing their best to fulfill their responsibilities, and it is appropriate to be harmonious and harmonious to achieve complete success. Unexpectedly, when the 13th meeting of the 12th of this month discussed the arrest of members Xu and Jin, all colleagues had no objection in principle to the point of requesting the authorities to punish the responsible personnel. The only difference was that there were slight differences in the text and tone. However, there were one or two members who did not allow others to speak, and their attitude was arrogant and their momentum was overwhelming, which was already unbearable. Moreover, there were even those who added insults, which was almost insulting. As a dignified representative of the people, on the sacred podium, they were so失态. The colleagues expressed their regret. They originally intended to correct it at the time, fearing that in the emotional excitement of each other, causing emotional unhappiness would be even more of a loss to this Yuan. For this reason, I am writing to ask Mr. to pay special attention. If such incidents occur again, it must be effectively stopped, otherwise the order of the meeting place will be impossible to maintain, and the dignity of the parliament will be swept away. It is also heard that the Yishi Daily in this city reported on the 13th that this Yuan selected three colleagues to participate in the peace talks, and they are about to go north, etc. Whether this news is true, and if so, what method is used for the so-called selection, and I hope to see the instructions for good fortune. Li Yaolin and more than 100 others respectfully initiated"

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 15th] Peng Fuzhong, Huang Keqin, and Xu Shaosheng, who were arrested in Xixian for the Xu Wentian case, were released and returned to Xixi on the 14th due to insufficient suspicion.

### Acheson's China Policy; Bridges Demands Investigation; Calls it "Unwise, Unfriendly" Behavior

[News Agency] Washington, 15th Broadcast: Republican Senator Bridges sent a letter to Connally, requesting that Congress investigate Acheson's policy of opposing strengthening military aid to China, calling Acheson's move "unwise, unfriendly, and unfavorable." He said: Acheson's position can be seen as deliberately undermining the Kuomintang's anti-communist efforts, and said that the State Department's policy only knows how to deal with communism in Europe and ignores communism in China, which is strange.

### Railway, Postal, and Telecommunications Freight Rates and Fees Adjusted Twice a Month; Legislative Yuan Passes Amendment; Amount to be Discussed by Executive Yuan Today and Implemented Tomorrow

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Executive Yuan's proposal to amend the railway, postal, and telecommunications freight rates and fee adjustment methods was passed as amended after heated debate at the 14th meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 15th and will be implemented from this month. The original adjustment method was 4: the cost index multiplied by the pre-war railway, postal, and telecommunications rates is the freight rate and fee to be adjusted, but the adjustment should be appropriately reduced by at least 50%. The meeting on the 15th passed the Executive Yuan's proposal to change 50% to 25%. The original adjustment method was 5: "It can be adjusted once a month, and the index increase rate will not be adjusted if it does not exceed 20% of the last adjustment amount." The meeting on the 13th passed the Executive Yuan's proposal to change the monthly adjustment to twice a month. During the discussion, the opinions of the members were divided into three categories: one category advocated that no adjustments should be made at all, represented by Zhang Zhijiang; one group advocated that more additions can be made during monthly adjustments, but only one adjustment should be made per month, represented by Zou Shuwen; one group advocated that two adjustments should be made per month, represented by Jiang Yiping. Recently, it was passed according to Jiang's and others' opinions. At the meeting on the 15th, Li Gongquan first spoke, advocating that more additions can be made, but not too early. Han Zhensheng expressed opposition to the government's subsidy policy, believing that subsidies only increase issuance and stimulate price increases. Zou Shuwen held the opposite view, believing that increasing issuance is enough to raise prices, but raising the prices of public utilities is even more enough to stimulate price increases. If public utilities increase prices once every ten days, it will accelerate the collapse of the entire economy. Zhang Zhijiang even believes that adjusting the prices of public utilities is just following the trend and will not help. The government should take measures to suppress prices at cost. Yang Buping also believes that increasing the prices of public utilities has too much impact on people's lives and advocates that prices cannot be increased. Jiang Yiping analyzed subsidies and price increases, saying that subsidies are borne by the people of the whole country, while price increases only affect a small number of people. It is better to change to adjusting twice a month. Qiao Hongshu, An Futing, Zhou Yongneng, and others all agreed with Jiang's opinion, and the chairman put it to a vote, which was passed by a majority.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] After the Legislative Yuan passed the amendment to the railway freight rate and fee adjustment method, the amount to be adjusted has been drafted by the Ministry of Communications. The Executive Yuan is scheduled to hold an administrative meeting on the 16th to discuss it. Once it is passed, it will be implemented from the 17th.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] After the Legislative Yuan passed the adjustment of postal, telecommunications, and railway freight rates and fees every half month, it is heard that the telecommunications department has decided to adjust it to five times. The telegram fee has increased from 200 yuan per word to 1,000 yuan, an increase of four times compared to before, which will be implemented after being passed by the administrative meeting on the 16th.

### Legislative Yuan Clears Accumulated Cases; Scheduled to Hold Extraordinary Meeting Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The 14th meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan was held at 9:30 a.m. on the 15th, presided over by President Tong.

The meeting continued at 3:30 p.m., and member Wu Yanhuan and 30 others submitted an emergency motion: "Advisory to the Executive Yuan to quickly send planes to Xinxiang to airdrop 750 tons of grain and start within a week to boost military morale and maintain people's lives." After deliberation, it was passed as it stood. Then the discussion of the proposal continued: (3) The proposal of budget committee finance member Yang Yifeng and others that the salaries of public servants and teachers across the country should be reasonably adjusted quickly was resolved to be returned for review and a report will be submitted at the meeting on the 16th before a decision is made. (4) The Legal Committee reported on the review of the Executive Yuan's advisory on the review of the Audit Department Organization Law and the Audit Office Organization Regulations. (5) Li Yunliang and others proposed that in order to maintain the circulation of the national economic lifeline, a national navigation plan should be prepared, and please review the proposal. After discussion, the above two cases were submitted to a vote at the Yuan meeting on the 16th because the number of members present was not the legal number.

### Program Committee Decides Today's Agenda of the Legislative Yuan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Legislative Yuan Program Committee held a meeting at 6:00 p.m. on the 15th, presided over by Chen Guyuan, and decided on the following matters: (1) At the 15th meeting on the 16th, the agenda items not discussed at the 14th meeting will be discussed; (2) The agenda items for the 16th meeting on the 19th include the Ministry of Economic Affairs Organization Law Draft Review Report and the Amended Postal Law Review Report; (3) Holding gold-priced deposits and improving the method of salary payment, review report; (4) Advisory to the Executive Yuan to organize a national property inventory organization and a special committee of this Yuan for the study of national property inventory, review report; (5) Committee members Chen Guyuan, Jiang Yiping, and others proposed to amend the current Supervision Law of the Control Yuan, the Organization Law of the Control Yuan Members, and the Organization Regulations of the Control Yuan Supervisory Committee Office.

### Local Fighting Breaks Out Again in Jiangbei; Communist Army Continues to Invade Gaoqiao and is Repelled; Contact Also Made in Anqing, Pinghan Road is Peaceful

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Jiangbei line, which had been silent for a while, has now started local fighting again. On the night of the 14th, Gaoqiao, the bridgehead on the opposite bank of Jiangdagang in Zhenjiang, continued to be invaded by more than 5,000 people from Chen Yi's Second Army. The defending army fought fiercely until 7:00 a.m. on the 15th with the help of the navy gunboats firing more than 2,000 rounds per hour to create a fierce fire net. After the national air force was also dispatched, the communist army finally collapsed and retreated to the north. The national army did not pursue it due to the peace talks. In addition, the communist army's Tenth Army in Anqing fired artillery shells at the national army positions such as the agricultural school in the eastern suburbs of the city again on the night of the 14th. After the national army counterattacked, it quickly subsided. There were no battles at the other Jiangbei bridgeheads on the 15th.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 15th] There are no battles on the Zhenjiang front. The communist army outpost is at Zhujia Qigan, three miles north of Liuyu, but there is only one company. Every night, small groups of local bandits constantly harass the outside of the village, but there is no contact. Also, there are more than 500 communist troops at Dutian Temple, three miles east of Liuyu. According to military sources, after the main force of the communist army retreated to the north, they are now setting up a line of defense north of Shijiaqiao and have set up more than a dozen mountain guns, which seems to be preparing to attack us.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 15th] Military News: (1) The line from Pinghan Zheng to Xiaogan Huangpi is still defended by the national army, and there has been no new movement between the two sides in recent days. (2) Several thousand communist troops from Nie Rongzhen's department have recently been found to be active west of the railway in central Hubei, but their intentions are unclear. (3) The communist troops of Lin Biao, Chen Geng, and other departments east of the railway are maintaining their original positions, and the lines are becoming more and more silent. However, a part of the communist army between Huangmei and Guangji in eastern Hubei is moving southeast, seemingly to support Anqing.

[Our Newspaper, Huangpi, 15th] Military News: The Pinghan front is peaceful today, but the number of communist troops continues to increase in the Changxuanling area east of the road. In addition, the communist army gathered in Yunmeng territory west of the road has been identified as a division of Nie Rongzhen's department, and the two regiments of communist army in Yingshan County also belong to Nie's department. According to travelers from the north, the communist army headquarters is now in Xinyang, and there are as many as 1,000 transportation vehicles in the area. The communist army is very busy deploying troops in southern Henan.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 15th] The General Headquarters announced: (1) At about 6:00 p.m. on the 14th, communist artillery fired ten shells at our Longshiqiao position north of the farm east of Anqing. The defending army suffered two casualties. After counterattacking, the shelling stopped. (2) At 2:00 a.m. on the night of the 14th, three or four hundred communist troops launched three consecutive attacks on the line of positions at Wulidun north of Anqing, but they were all repelled by the defending army. Another group of more than one hundred people also attacked Qingfengling (west of Longwang Temple) at the same time, but were also repelled.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] According to a certain authoritative military observer speaking to reporters, since Mao Zedong ordered the cessation of military operations on the 10th, it has been five days. During this period, although the communist army in some areas on the Jiangbei front has automatically withdrawn, and the entire line was once silent yesterday, in view of the fact that local battles broke out again in Jiangbei yesterday and a fierce offensive was launched against Taiyuan, the so-called order to "cease military operations" conveyed to the government representatives is actually a kind of "diplomatic rhetoric." The purpose of the local withdrawal is nothing more than to relax the national army's defenses, eliminate the national army's fighting spirit, and then carry out their deceitful techniques of wanting to capture and let go, to occupy the national army's positions and create a favorable situation. Now the national army has raised its vigilance and is on strict alert.

### Many Xiang River Ships are Returning; People's Hearts in Wuhan are Stabilizing

The regular ships going to Caidian are also operating as usual today. Although the authorities have not officially withdrawn the order to concentrate Xiang River ships, the order has in fact been stopped due to the silence on the front line, so the hearts of the people, which were once turbulent, have now gradually stabilized.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 15th] General Ma Hongda, chairman of Ningxia Province, who is famous for being overweight, publicly denied the news that he weighed 300 pounds on the 15th, saying in the original text: "Yesterday, a certain evening newspaper said that I weigh 300 pounds, which is not true.

### Hong Kong People Hope for Fair Gold Pricing

[Our Hong Kong Dispatch, 15th] Following the Hong Kong government's ban on buying, selling, and possessing gold, the market was shocked. Commodity prices have not fluctuated yet, and the jewelry trade has not been affected. There are rumors that gold stored in bank safe deposit boxes will be frozen. Hong Kong government personnel have already gone to major gold firms to register gold deposits. Financial circles estimate that 400,000 taels of gold are stored in Hong Kong, with each tael currently valued at 320 yuan. However, according to the official price plus shipping costs, it is only worth about 200 yuan. The Hong Kong government's official price has not yet been announced. Public opinion widely hopes that the Hong Kong government can establish a fair gold collection method so that citizens do not suffer too much loss.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 15th] The Hong Kong Gold and Silver Exchange, where gold trading has been a major activity in recent years, held a meeting this morning to discuss the Hong Kong government's ban on gold trading and private possession, which was announced yesterday and implemented today.

They also asked Ho Sin-hang and five others to visit Luo Wenjin, a representative of the Chinese community, to request that the Hong Kong government ease restrictions.

### Editorial: A Review of the Dispersal Policy

In recent years, the activities of central banks in various countries in the open market have become increasingly active, which is sufficient to show the importance of modern central banks in controlling the market. Recently, the Central Bank of our country has also participated in open market activities—such as disposing of gold and silver, yarn, sugar, foreign exchange transfer certificates, etc.; but these activities are more for achieving its fiscal goals than for fulfilling its financial mission. Because it is passive, not active, it is the consumption of materials, not the use of materials, so the current dispersal policy, in addition to aggravating financial disturbances, is actually of no benefit to the policy itself.

On the 4th of this month, the materials disposed of by the Central Bank in the market, taking only gold as an example, exceeded 60,000 taels. This caused a sudden contraction of credit and an unprecedented chaotic phenomenon in the market. Although this measure was "a fatal blow to general speculators" (quoted from a speech by a person in charge of the Central Bank); but the price increases caused by this are obviously unstoppable. The Legislative Yuan has also paid close attention to this round of price increases. At the Yuan meeting on the 12th of this month, it raised enthusiastic questions to President Liu of the Central Bank. According to Liu's reply at the time, he believed that "the purpose of dispersing gold is to contract currency and suppress prices, and the gold is dispersed at market prices, so buyers cannot profit." No matter how pleasant this kind of official rhetoric sounds, our objective view of the dispersal policy cannot excuse the authorities' wrong decision-making.

Indeed, the gold dispersal policy expressed by Liu can contract currency and suppress prices; but in the current extraordinary situation, we believe that we must never follow theory and deny the real environment. Our current financial difficulties and the rampant floating capital have become a major event that everyone feels is shocking. At this time, if we talk about the dispersal policy, no matter how much gold, silver, yarn, sugar, and foreign exchange certificates, etc., I am afraid it will not be easy to achieve much effect, because the relationship between finance and the printing press cannot be separated, so despite disposing on one side, large amounts of funds are released on the other. As a result, the currency recovered always cannot offset the number of new banknotes released, so that between this incoming and outgoing, it has repeatedly become an opportunity for a few special people to make a fortune, and the interests of the country have been lost.

Secondly, the Central Bank's manipulation policy has always been nothing more than the consistent policy of "dispersing when high and supplementing when low." This is also a way for it to use the status of a super-large household, with this invincible posture, to control the market. But whether this hegemonic approach can stabilize the market and lower prices is doubtful. First, the rise and fall of various prices are now mostly related to financial commodities. Now that financial commodities are being hyped up by the Central Bank, prices are always booming, creating a general bullish psychology, making speculators even more unscrupulous and invincible. Second, the reason why open markets in various countries are successful is because their central banks have the power to control interest rates and control credit, and at the same time they are not constrained by currency inflation. Now that currency is maliciously inflated in our country, general funds are floating outside the financial circle, and of course none of the above conditions are met. How can the policy succeed? Based on these two points alone, it can be seen that the current dispersal policy does more harm than good.

Furthermore, in terms of the actual application of the dispersal policy, the Central Bank's dispersal policy is tantamount to encouraging people to speculate. Although the price of gold and banknotes can be suppressed at a certain time, the rise in prices will resume once the dispersal stops. The so-called heavier the suppression, the more violent the reaction, especially for the securities market where there are no stocks to disperse, it is like adding fuel to the fire. From the 4th of this month, Wing On Textile Factory rose from 18 yuan per share to 76.8 yuan as of yesterday, rising eight or nine limit-up in a row in twelve days; even when the Central Bank dispersed, gold and banknotes rose slightly, while stocks were the only ones that did well, still hitting the limit-up, which is not only an unprecedented rise in the securities market, but also an irony of the current dispersal policy. May I ask whether the financial authorities can also use "dispersal" to suppress the raging stock speculation market?

In addition, there is another point that is worth the attention of the authorities, that is, our country's wealth has long been exhausted due to the influence of the eight-year war of resistance and the four-year civil war. Where is there still the strength to disperse? According to the report of Supervisory Committee member Xiong Zaiwei et al. on the Central Bank's inventory, "the number of gold, silver, and other items dispersed from February 28th to the present is extremely large." Although Xiong et al. did not specify the amount dispersed, we are sure that it accounts for a considerable face value. It should be known that although the gold, silver, foreign exchange, materials, etc. that the Central Bank is constantly disposing of today have times when they are absorbed at low prices, they still inevitably fall into the hands of speculators in large quantities. Therefore, we suggest that the authorities should stop in time as soon as possible, and quickly take the gold and silver foreign exchange to foreign countries to exchange for daily necessities for people's livelihood, or machinery and raw materials needed for production, to replenish national strength. That is a wise measure. "It's not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost," and I hope the financial authorities will make a wise choice as soon as possible.

### President Fu Sinian of National Taiwan University Discusses Future Improvement Plans; Establishing Educational and Academic Systems

### United Nations General Assembly Resolves to Limit Use of Veto Power; Soviet Bloc Unanimously Votes Against; First Round of Atlantic Pact Verbal Sparring Concludes

[Reuters, Flushing Meadow, 15th] The United Nations General Assembly voted yesterday by a vote of 43 to 6 to decide that the five permanent members of the Security Council should not use their veto power except on extremely important issues. The six countries of the Soviet bloc voted against, while India and Myanmar abstained. The resolution was proposed by China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. In addition to suggesting limitations on the use of the veto power, it also stipulates that the five permanent members should exchange opinions before the Security Council makes major decisions. China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France emphasized that the use of the veto power must be restricted to prevent its abuse from paralyzing the Security Council. The Soviet representative emphasized that the veto power is the cornerstone of the United Nations and should not be modified. He proposed convening a consultative meeting of the major powers of the Security Council to seek ways to improve the possibility of reaching unanimous resolutions among the major powers, but this was ultimately rejected by the General Assembly.

[United Press, New York, 15th] Soviet representative Gromyko issued a statement in the General Assembly last night in response to accusations by British representative McNeil and American representative Austin, and criticized Western countries as "hypocritical." The first round of verbal sparring over the North Atlantic Treaty has now concluded. Some representatives hope that this matter can be concluded at this session. Other representatives say that there is still one month left in the session, and the Soviet representative will definitely take the opportunity to launch further attacks.

[Reuters, Flushing Meadow, 14th] British Chief Representative McNeil responded to Gromyko's attacks, saying that it was surprising that Gromyko, while discussing the veto power issue, brought up the issue of the Atlantic Pact with an attitude of barbaric aggression. After congratulating Gromyko on his appointment as the Soviet Union's first deputy foreign minister, McNeil said that Gromyko's colleagues, including himself, had originally expected that after Gromyko's promotion, he would adopt new procedures and methods, but unfortunately, although Gromyko's position was new, his methods remained the same. If the Soviet Union wishes to express its opinions on the Atlantic Pact, it should find a way to include it on the agenda of the General Assembly, and should not insert the Atlantic Pact while discussing other issues. Gromyko should know that the Atlantic Pact is purely defensive in nature, so only countries that are considering aggression can have reason to oppose the treaty.

[United Press, Flushing Meadow, 14th] American representative Austin, following McNeil, gave a speech stating that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko's accusation that the alliance of twelve countries was aimed at the Soviet Union "has no reasonable basis." He continued, "The treaty is the best way to guarantee peace. It is not an instrument of aggression, nor can it be used as an instrument of aggression, because this treaty is based on the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter."

### Kostov Dismissed Just Ten Days Ago; Bulgarian Premier Goes to Soviet Union for Treatment; Inside Story of Iron Curtain Arouses Speculation; Ambassadors to Yugoslavia from Romania, Bulgaria, and Poland Return to Posts

[United Press, London, 14th] Bulgarian Premier Dimitrov resigned today from his positions as head of government and leader of the Bulgarian Communist Party. Western diplomats believe this is a sign of the collapse of the Soviet Union's Balkan empire.

Official sources in Sofia announced that Dimitrov had been granted "home leave" to receive medical treatment in the Soviet Union. This occurred only ten days after Dimitrov's right-hand man, Kostov, was removed from his positions as Deputy Premier and Chairman of the Economic and Financial Committee, and secret sources in Yugoslavia were rumored to have reported that the Bulgarian Communist Party had launched a full-scale purge.

The announcement of Dimitrov's "home leave" was jointly issued by the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Council of Ministers. The announcement did not elaborate on the term "home leave," but it is generally known that Dimitrov is ill. Dimitrov is 66 years old and also a Soviet citizen. At the same time, another announcement stated that Kostov had been appointed as the Director of the Bulgarian National Library.

The announcement of Dimitrov's departure has raised two questions among Balkan experts: (1) Will another Soviet satellite state spread its wings and fly away? (2) Has the struggle between Stalin and Tito for influence in the Balkans expanded? Official announcements, as usual, do not explain the details, but it is more noticeable than any event since Tito was expelled from the Cominform last year. Before Tito was expelled from the Cominform, he was quite friendly with Dimitrov, and they shared the same views on the future of the Balkans, both being major representatives of a Balkan or Eastern European Federation. The Soviet side has always opposed this federation plan. Dimitrov tried to restore this federation plan after the war, but it was ultimately not permitted by the Soviet Union. On January 17th of last year, he made another attempt, telling reporters in Rome that the establishment of an Eastern European Federation was still too early, but "the appropriate time will eventually come." The sudden announcement of Dimitrov's departure today clearly indicates preparations for Kolalov, who was trained in Moscow, to temporarily succeed him as acting premier. Kolalov is currently Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister.

[United Press, Belgrade, 15th] It is reported that the ambassadors to Yugoslavia from Romania, Bulgaria, and Poland have returned here after leaving Belgrade for a considerable period of time, but there is still no news of the Albanian ambassador returning to his post. In recent months, the embassies of various countries have been almost empty. According to Cominform sources, the Soviet ambassador will not be recalled, but may be replaced. The Czech ambassador already has a new position, but there are no signs of a new person being replaced in the near future. They said that the Hungarian ambassador has been out of office for two months.

### Personnel Changes in Bulgaria Surprise London; Yugoslavia Pays Close Attention

[Report from this newspaper] London, 15th Broadcast: The sudden announcement by Bulgarian Communist Party veteran Dimitrov that he is "on leave" due to illness has greatly surprised Balkan experts here. This development is the most important since the split between the Kremlin and Tito. According to reports, in February of this year, the Communist Party-led "Bulgarian Fatherland Front" launched a purge of "anti-people elements." In March, Dimitrov's closest student, Kostov, was suddenly removed from his position as Deputy Premier, even though Dimitrov had long intended for Kostov to be his successor. The reason for Kostov's dismissal was his nationalistic tendencies, and his "crimes" were the same as Tito's. Now, Dimitrov himself is also reportedly going to the Soviet Union for treatment. Since Kostov's departure, Dimitrov has never mentioned Kostov's name in public. Therefore, it is speculated here that Bulgarian leaders may have criticized Dimitrov for failing to prevent Kostov's transformation beforehand. The most noteworthy thing at present is whether Bulgaria will form a new government and replace Dimitrov with a new person. However, this matter may be delayed, because Bulgarians have long regarded Dimitrov as the nation's mentor, and it seems inconvenient to replace him at this time.

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 15th Broadcast: Belgrade News, since Bulgarian Communist leader Dimitrov left here for the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia's Marshal Tito has become the only "giant" in the Balkans. Yugoslavia expects that the Cominform will launch even more intense attacks against Tito and his supporters in the future.

### US Congress Completes Action on European Recovery Program Funding Bill

### Prime Ministers of Australia, New Zealand, and Others Arrive in London Next Tuesday to Attend Commonwealth Conference; Status of India to Be Most Important Topic

[Reuters, London, 14th] Australian Prime Minister Chifley, New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser, Pakistani Prime Minister Ali Khan, and Ceylonese Prime Minister Senanayake will arrive in London on the same plane next Tuesday to attend the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference. South African Prime Minister Malan departed from Cape Town today for England and is scheduled to arrive in London next Tuesday.

[United Press, New Delhi, 14th] Highly reliable sources claimed on the 14th that India will remain in the British Commonwealth and recognize King George as the head of the Commonwealth. Indian Prime Minister Nehru will explain India's position when he attends the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in London after Easter. London diplomatic circles say that India's status in the Commonwealth will be the most important topic discussed at the conference. British authorities say that if India remains in the Commonwealth, it must recognize the King, as he is the common bond between Commonwealth countries. Officials of Nehru's National Congress Party say that Prime Minister Nehru will emphasize that Indonesia is no longer a British dominion, but a "sovereign democratic republic," but is still willing to remain in the Commonwealth. These officials continued, "India will retain complete control over defense, foreign affairs, and internal affairs, and India will also demand assurances that Commonwealth member states have no military obligations." National Congress Party sources pointed out that British Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, Welkgot, has taken the above formula to British Prime Minister Attlee. It is said that Attlee has stipulated that India must recognize the King.

### US Senator Nolan Urges Government to Arm South Korea and Condemns Wait-and-See Policy Toward China

[United Press, Washington, 14th] Senator Nolan urged on the 14th that the plan to arm free nations be expanded to include South Korea. He told the Senate that South Korea "urgently needs" American arms to avoid being "ravaged" by communist troops. He said that South Korea faces the threat of 196,000 communist troops from North Korea. Nolan also warned against a "wait-and-see" policy toward the Chinese civil war. He said that this position will drive China's 450 million people behind the Iron Curtain. Nolan believes that Congress should consider taking similar action in the Far East before completing action on the Atlantic Pact and the arms export program to Europe.

Truman replied that this question had been adequately answered by Acheson on Wednesday.

This effort was the first requirement of the nine-point economic stabilization plan announced by MacArthur in December of last year due to Dodge's insistence and emphasis on creating and implementing a balanced budget.

### Plaster Statue Actually Sheds Tears

New York Trash Can Side Drama Plays Out as a Miracle

[United Press, Syracuse, New York, 14th] An eleven-year-old girl named Anna here picked up a plaster statue of Saint Anne's head from a trash can last night and kissed its forehead. Hundreds of viewers said they had seen the statue's eyes repeatedly shedding tears. Others who kissed it had no reaction. Catholic priest Fufaro said he had witnessed this and found it incredible. Two other priests have also seen it. Anna is the eldest daughter of a milkman here, and the whole family is Catholic. She almost exhausted herself last night by performing this miracle for several hours. Saint Anne is the mother of the Virgin Mary. According to McMahon, Dean of the Pottery College of Alfred University in New York, speaking by telephone to reporters, it seems possible for the statue to shed tears from a scientific standpoint. Plaster easily absorbs water, but does not release it except through evaporation.

### Old Clam Produces Pearl

### East Berlin Suggests Relaxing Blockade; Resuming Trade Between East and West; West Berlin Mayor Directly Rejects It

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 15th Broadcast: Berlin News, the Mayor of the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin, Ebert, suggested on the 14th to relax the Soviet blockade so that factories in West Berlin could obtain raw materials from the Soviet-occupied zone, and its manufactured goods could also be transported to the Soviet zone. However, the Mayor of West Berlin, Reuter, has rejected this. Reuter also said that the Soviet blockade should be completely lifted immediately, and free elections should be held in the Soviet-occupied zone before trade between East and West Berlin can be restored. Berlin communist newspapers strongly criticized Reuter's attitude, and said that for the people of West Berlin, trade between East and West is urgently needed. Observers here say that the proposal to relax the Soviet blockade does not indicate that the Soviet side is willing to make peace, but is actually an attempt to increase production in East Berlin, because production in the Soviet-occupied zone has been greatly affected after Western countries refused to transport raw materials to East Germany.

### Cash for Salaries Flows into Banks; City Industrial Association Directors and Supervisors Negotiate with National Bank and Obtain Results; 70 Billion to Be Claimed and Distributed Directly; After Calculating Quotas for Each Industry, Cash to Be Collected in Total

[Report from this newspaper] Although the Central Bank has agreed to provide half of the cash needed for factory payrolls in this city, with the National Bank supplying 90 billion yuan in cash on the 15th, 16th, and 18th, the National Bank's insistence on having the cash claimed by banks and firms resulted in yesterday's release of 20 billion yuan in cash, representing 30% of the National Bank's relaxation of cash withdrawals from deposits. Although the banks and firms claimed the cash, the factories did not receive it. Yesterday, prices soared, and workers demanded cash from the factories, which were unable to meet the demand.

The City Industrial Association convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors at 2 p.m. yesterday. As a result of the discussion, all directors and supervisors, led by Dong Yunzhang, Hong Nianzu, and Ouyang Lun, went to the Central Bank to petition. After waiting for more than an hour, Director Lin of the bank's Business Bureau came out to meet them.

According to Director Lin's report, in addition to issuing 20 billion yuan in cash to banks and firms today, 20 billion yuan in bank drafts were also issued. In addition, another 10 billion yuan in cash will be issued to state-owned enterprises. Since the 20 billion yuan in cash claimed by the banks and firms cannot reach the factories, it is hoped that the local authorities will find a way to guide the money industry, and that Director Cao of the City Social Affairs Bureau will take responsibility. As for the 70 billion yuan in cash to be issued today (16th) and on the 18th, because the banks and firms did not keep their promises, it was decided to deduct it all and allocate it to the Industrial Association. 30 billion yuan will be allocated on the 16th, and 40 billion yuan on the 18th. The method is to have the Industrial Association calculate the quotas for each industry, issue National Bank checks to the relevant banks and firms, and have the guilds endorse the checks before collecting the cash from the National Bank.

After the representatives of the City Industrial Association obtained this solution, Ouyang Lun, Hong Nianzu, Tian Heqing, Cai Tingtao, and Guo Yongxi calculated the amount of cash to be distributed to each industry according to the list of workers and wages reported by each industry guild overnight. On average, each worker can receive 155,276 yuan in cash. However, because the National Bank needs to be withdrawn in two days (30 billion yuan on the 16th, and 40 billion yuan on the 18th), only three-sevenths can be withdrawn on the 16th, and four-sevenths on the 18th. For the cash withdrawal procedure, each industry will issue National Bank checks to the banks and firms they deal with based on the Industrial Association's quota, and after the checks are endorsed by the industry guild, they will collect all the checks from the industry and withdraw the money from the National Bank. It is reported that the National Bank's payment office hours today will be extended until 5 p.m. The amount of cash to be allocated to each industry will be notified by the Industrial Association to each industry guild in a special letter this morning.

### Authorities Decide to Thoroughly Investigate and Prosecute Banks and Firms that Deduct Cash for Salaries

[Report from this newspaper] City Government Secretary-General Chen Liang expressed extreme anger that the huge amount of cash prepared by the National Bank for payrolls yesterday did not reach the hands of the workers. He believes that some banks and firms have deducted the cash after it was allocated, causing it to flow into the discount market, resulting in a serious situation of 20% discount, which is enough to disrupt finance and harm people's livelihood, and decided to investigate and prosecute thoroughly. Secretary-General Chen believes that the rise in the cost of living is the result of soaring prices, not the cause. Therefore, he said that the increase in various prices today due to the impact of the cost of living is very unreasonable. Some unscrupulous merchants deliberately raise prices to harm the citizens, and the authorities will implement reasonable control. The authorities will take decisive action against banks and firms in this city that deduct cash, and will arrest them when necessary and punish them under martial law.

### City Government Routine Meeting Passes Resolution: Prices of All Levels of Meals Calculated Based on Rice Prices

[Report from this newspaper] The City Government held a routine meeting yesterday morning, chaired by Secretary-General Chen Liang, to discuss and resolve the following matters: (1) Proposal from the Social Affairs Bureau: Draft measures for accommodating street beggars in this city, please make a resolution. Resolution: Amended and passed. (2) Proposal from the Social Affairs Bureau: Whether it is feasible to approve meal prices and adopt a base price calculation method, please discuss. Resolution: Passed. (The selling price of Grade A meals is calculated based on 2.5 liters of white japonica rice, the selling price of Grade B meals is calculated based on 2 liters of white japonica rice, and the selling price of Grade C meals is calculated based on 1.5 liters of white japonica rice, all based on the reported market price of rice and can be adjusted accordingly. If the rice price rises or falls by 20%, it can be reviewed and increased or decreased.) (3) Pass the Shanghai Laundry Management Regulations and send them to the City Council. (4) Allocate ten acres of land in the Dabao Cemetery area to the Pushan Villa for burying deceased and wounded soldiers. (5) The base amount of supplementary food expenses for students in each municipal normal school in this city will be approved from April onwards, at 10 yuan per student per month, and will still be calculated according to the cost of living index.

Gu and Zhang flew to Guangzhou on the 6th of this month to attend the KMT Central Standing Committee meeting. They stayed in Guangzhou for ten days. Regarding the Guangdong side's view of the current situation, they said that they did not want to add anything other than what was disclosed in the newspapers, so as to avoid misunderstandings. Reporters asked for confirmation of rumors that Gu Zhenggang might be appointed as the Mayor of Shanghai. Gu repeatedly shook his head and said it was impossible, and said that he was assisting General Tang Enbo in handling some political affairs in Shanghai based entirely on friendship. The rumors that he was serving as a consultant to the headquarters were also a misunderstanding.

The Jiang Defense Battle Intensifies: A Visit to the Anqing Front (Part 1) By Our Correspondent Liu Wei

[Anqing, This Newspaper, 12th] Anqing is a famous city on the Yangtze River and a stronghold. Under the combined operations of the national army's navy, army, and air force, it has been fighting bitterly for more than twenty days, but it still stands firmly on the banks of the great river, as stable as Mount Tai and unmoved.

Today, the soldiers of Guangxi are writing a glorious chapter in the Jiang Defense Battle by using "resolute defense" to shatter the communist army's belief in "inevitable victory" in Anqing. It is not only comparable to the famous Changsha Battle and the 47-day Defense of Hengyang during the Anti-Japanese War, but it is also a successful example of a three-dimensional war coordinated by the national army's navy, army, and air force.

With the assistance of Xu Qiming, Deputy Commander of the Eighth Pacification Zone, and Major General Huang Guannan, Colonel Li Xing, and Colonel Han Muxuan, the reporter spent three days traveling from Jiujiang to Anqing, the national army's bridgehead.

Difficult Road Conditions

This time, the reporter entered the famous city that has been fighting bitterly for more than ten days from Jiujiang. The journey of only 180 kilometers took three days, and I arrived outside the city at 6:00 PM on the 12th. As it was already curfew time when pedestrians were prohibited from entering the city, Colonel Bao Shiqi, the director of the political work department of the garrison, was consulted to send Clerk Chen out of the city to meet and guide me into the city. Under the bright moon, amidst the symphony of gunfire, wandering around the famous city on the riverbank and seeing the peaceful scenery inside the city, the fatigue of the journey suddenly disappeared.

From Jiujiang to Anqing, the only safe transportation line now relies entirely on a hastily repaired highway. Because the communist army's intrusion into Huayang has blocked water transportation, except for naval vessels that can pass through the communist army's obstacles with artillery fire, other ships can only sail between Jiujiang and Pengze according to the Jiang defense regulations. However, except for military ships, in the vast Yangtze River east of Jiujiang, due to military reasons, one can only see rolling white waves but no shadows of sailboats.

The highway from Jiujiang to Anqing is 180 kilometers long. Because it was temporarily repaired, it is only a single-lane muddy road. The road surface is bumpy and uneven. In the event of rain, it is even more difficult to travel. Even highly skilled drivers regard it as a daunting task.

Visiting General Wu Zhongjian

After entering Anqing City, the first thing the reporter did was to visit General Wu Zhongjian, the commander of the garrison. The place where he lived was the core area of the fortifications. After passing through several layers of street and lane fortresses, piano music came from the curtains in a Western-style courtyard. It turned out that our Anqing garrison commander, General Wu, was playing the song "Seeking Peace in War."

General Wu gave the reporter the impression of being short and energetic. He did not have the air of an official or a crude manner towards an unfamiliar news reporter. He could analyze every matter or question with reason. Therefore, we talked about the KMT-CPC peace talks, the Anqing defense battle, and the recent world situation. He firmly believed that only by having one's own methods and strength can one achieve true peace. Taking the KMT-CPC peace talks as an example, if the Anqing bridgehead defense battle had taken a turn for the worse, then the communist party's so-called "peaceful cloak" would have long been removed to Jiangnan.

"Little Zhuge" Offensive

He was very satisfied with the success of this coordinated naval, land, and air operation and the assistance of the people of Anqing. At the same time, he was also satisfied with the communist party's Liu Bocheng's offensive, which enabled him to have a better opportunity to write a brilliant victory for the national army in the Anqing bridgehead defense battle with a small number of troops against the communist army, which was more than five times its size. He said: Liu Bocheng, the commander of the communist army in the "Battle of Anqing," is a famous general in the communist army, known as "One-Eyed Dragon" and "Little Zhuge." General Wu himself admitted that he was a short and as-yet-unnamed national army commander. If he could successfully defend Anqing and defeat Liu Bocheng in a desperate fight, then our short commander, Major General Wu Zhongjian, would also become famous.

Liu Bocheng gave a speech in Hefei to his troops attacking Anqing, saying: This time, you go and take over Anqing! He also said: If you can't fight a good victory, don't come back! Even the letter from Communist Army 11th Army Commander Du Yide to General Wu on the 6th and 7th of this month clearly stated that he was ordered to take over Anqing. Then, Anqing is still under the protection of the national army and is peaceful and auspicious today. The facts tell us who won the battle. Hangzhou! You should hold your head high!

Rejecting the Pity and Favor of the Rich By Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

[Hangzhou, This Newspaper, 13th] Although the mood of the people in paradise is unusually heavy, and the soaring prices are like a heavy lead that makes people breathless, there are still quite a few people coming to Hangzhou for spring outings. Although the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway did not add special spring outing trains like last year, it did add carriages after several trains. However, the grand scene is not as good as in previous years. The carriages added are no longer well-equipped first-class carriages, but only barely satisfactory second-class carriages. From this, we can see the economic situation of the people being carried. Top-class hotels such as Xileng, Dahua, and Xinxin are not always full, and the West Lake, Hubin, and Huanhu on the shore of West Lake are not necessarily crowded. Only some third- and fourth-class hotels are very lively. The teahouses are also the same. Louwailou and Taiheyuan are not like in previous years, where people queue up to eat. Although there are also sedans and punts in front of the door, they are not congested on the roads of the Outer West Lake.

In the famous scenic spots, few people sit down to drink tea, they just stroll around.

Yuan Datou Rampant

People from the Beijing-Shanghai area are mostly middle- and lower-level merchants with a sense of adventure. Although they still miss Hangzhou and still come to Hangzhou to play, they must calculate their travel expenses. An average person who comes to Hangzhou for a trip needs at least one Yuan Datou per day for a hotel, one Yuan Datou per meal, two Yuan Datou for rickshaw fare, and five Yuan Datou per day for hiring a punt. In total, it costs six or seven Yuan Datou per day. Civil servants, people in the cultural field, and people in the education field simply do not have the ability to come to Hangzhou. Even middle- and lower-level merchants have to think twice. No wonder they have become a stingy bunch.

A Pleasing Sound

Speaking of Yuan Datou, it has reached its extreme in Hangzhou. The government originally designated three places, namely Chengzhan, Shuiyangqiao, and Zhong'anqiao, as silver dollar markets, but Shuiyangqiao has expanded to the entire Qingtai Street. Qingtai Street is a major transportation route, and it is crowded every day. Chengzhan is also like this, and Zhong'anqiao is also like this. Now, silver dollar trading has almost developed on every street: Yanling Road, Yingshi Road, and Hubin Road all have the sound of clanging silver dollars, a pleasing sound to the ear. The police have intervened at one time, but they could not intervene well, so they had to let the silver dollar trading go. Recently, in food shops, there are also people trading silver dollars. Famous scenic spots such as Lingyin, Yue Tomb, and even Jiuxi Eighteen Ravines all have vendors trading silver dollars. Many tourists who come for spring outings bring silver dollars and exchange them with these vendors because they feel that the gold yuan is worthless and the silver dollar is valuable. Therefore, after exchanging for gold yuan, they naturally save money and use it sparingly to avoid exchanging too many silver dollars. This is certainly a psychological factor for the weak spring season this year.

Relying on the Spring Season

This year's spring season is obviously not as good as in previous years. Many people who rely on the spring season to live for a year are complaining and disappointed. They complain about the unrest in the current situation. Otherwise, wealthy merchants would definitely come together, and they could breathe a little easier. But Hangzhou has its own value. Hangzhou cannot always be a consumer city for people to appreciate. It should stand up, hold its head high, and reject all the pity and favor of the rich. It should make people who come here take back incomparable "spiritual food." It should make people feel that Hangzhou is an indispensable place for cultivation.

Hangzhou! Although you have a beautiful appearance, you must have rich content, or you may avoid falling into the tragic situation of being appreciated when people are happy and abandoned when they are unhappy.

Money Supply Eases, Prices Rise Across the Board: Rice Prices Soar Madly; White粳 and Thin Rice Spot Prices Exceed 600,000 Mark

The rice market has skyrocketed due to the easing of money supply and rising gold and commodity prices, causing extreme bullish sentiment. At the opening, white粳 and early rice opened at 530,000 to 550,000, but the market was extremely tight. The Social Affairs Bureau immediately ordered that transactions be limited to 550,000, advising against exceeding it, but prices continued to rise. White粳 and thin rice were bid at 600,000, and early rice at 580,000, all for spot payments, representing a nearly 50% surge compared to the previous day. Today, banker's draft prices for white粳 and thin rice are 660,000, and early rice is 640,000. Total arrivals in the two markets were 2,426 shi.

Edible Oil Prices Soar Madly

Edible oil prices have risen rapidly due to the easing of money supply and rising commodity prices. Edible oil is in short supply, and prices have risen even more sharply. Rapeseed oil rose from 2.9 million to close at 3.25 million, and soybean oil closed at 3.9 million, each soaring by more than 50%. Crude oil was at 3.85 million, and no one sold it in the after-market. All other commodities rose by 50%. Soybean cake reached the 200,000 mark, and "Li Zi" cake was at 210,000.

Flour Market

Flour market prices fluctuated violently. Transactions were delayed because the Social Affairs Bureau ordered strict prohibition of price gouging, and people were wary and dared not trade openly. However, an undercurrent of activity was surging. "Bing Chuan" flour reached a high of 270,000 but was difficult to buy. Towards the close, it was reported that the Central Bank was dumping again, and gold prices plummeted. Market prices then collapsed, falling from 260,000 to 246,000. Retail investors slightly absorbed the low price, and the last transaction returned to 250,000. "Lao Che" flour closed at 266,000. Wheat bran remained untraded at the opening.

Miscellaneous Grains

All-around Surge: Soybean prices surged by more than 50%, with winter beans reaching as high as 650,000. Raw peanuts rose by more than 40%, with Yangzhou raw peanuts reaching a peak of 1.5 million. Sesame prices surpassed 100,000, and sellers were holding firm, resulting in very few transactions. Corn rose by 45%, and red sorghum and mung beans continued to soar.

Gold Market Activity Outside the Exchange: National Bank Dumps Heavily to Suppress Prices

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, the gold market was extraordinarily bullish due to the influence of the Hong Kong gold rush. Amidst the competition among buyers, the market opened in the morning at 4.5 million and rose all the way to the 5.04 million upper limit, with demand exceeding supply, resulting in a standstill. In the afternoon, buying and selling were cautious, and activity was sparse. Transactions remained in a holding pattern, rising another 840,000 from the previous day.

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, the off-exchange spot market opened at 5.8 million and 6.3 million. Midday buying activity was strong, pushing prices up to 6.5 million and 6.8 million. Around 10:00 AM, the Central Bank commissioned Dadecheng and Zhaofengchang Gold Shops to aggressively sell off gold. The initial price was 6.1 million, gradually dropping to 5.8 million. Near noon, it was further reduced to 5.5 million, with a total of over 580 large bars sold. Market sentiment softened slightly, and prices briefly rebounded to 5.6 million and 5.9 million. The noon close was 5.8 million and 6.1 million.

In the afternoon, overnight transactions opened at 6.6 million and 6.8 million. Due to favorable external factors, the market was bullish, and prices once broke through the 7 million mark, reaching as high as 7.1 million and 7.4 million. The Central Bank commissioned Dadecheng and Zhaofengchang to continue dumping large quantities of gold through dual channels, reducing the price of overnight positions from 7.3 million and 6.9 million all the way to 6.5 million, with another 200 large bars sold. The upward trend was slightly curbed, and leveraged buyers sold off positions, causing prices to fall to 6.5 million and 6.7 million at the close.

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, gold jewelry prices changed twice. In the morning, they were listed at 5.6 million and 6.2 million, and in the afternoon, they rose to 6 million and 6.7 million, an increase of 6 million from the previous day. Silver jewelry also rose by 5,000, increasing to 50,000 and 70,000. According to Mr. Wu Pengnian, due to a lack of cash, most of the retail transactions in recent days have been conducted with checks. Moreover, the volatile gold prices have made business quite difficult. Therefore, the buying and selling prices yesterday were extended to 700,000.

US Dollar

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, the off-exchange US dollar market was tight due to a scarcity of chips, and large transactions were in demand with no supply, resulting in a firm footing. The market opened in the morning at 120,000 and 130,000, reaching highs of 135,000 and 140,000, and lows of 115,000 and 120,000. The noon close was 130,000 and 135,000.

One Ounce of Gold Equivalent to Fifty "Tai Tou" Silver Dollars

[Reported by This Newspaper] The exchange rate between the Central Bank's gold and Yuan Datou silver dollars was announced late at noon. One ounce of gold was equivalent to 50 Yuan Datou silver dollars, an increase of two yuan from the previous day. However, because the announcement time was too late, most factories could not directly exchange with the National Bank and still had to go through the hands of various firms. Therefore, the number of silver dollars exchanged yesterday was not large.

Silver Dollars Soar

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, silver dollar arbitrage was sluggish because Shanghai prices were turbulent, and participants were uneasy. There were slightly more transactions in North China, and exchange rates went straight up. Transactions in other areas, such as South China and West China, were quiet, with a total of about 150,000 exchanged.

Street Transactions Rise and Fall Suddenly

Street transactions rose and fell suddenly and were volatile. In the middle of the month, due to the payment of salaries, the liquidation of various retail investors was active. Moreover, with gold prices soaring again, market sentiment was strong. "Da Tou" (Big Head) silver dollars initially traded at 100,000 and 110,000, once rising to 125,000 and 135,000 near noon. In the afternoon, due to the high prices, some inventory was cleared, dropping to 110,000 and 120,000. In the evening, they rose again to 120,000 and 130,000. "Xiao Tou" (Small Head) silver dollars were bid at 95,000 and 100,500. "Long Ying Yang" silver dollars were bid at 70,000 and 75,000. Banker's draft transactions once reached highs of 135,000 and 145,000, falling slightly to 130,000 and 140,000 in the afternoon, an increase of 25,000 across the board compared to the previous day.

50,000 and 100,000 Denomination Notes Not Issued Yesterday

Suspended Due to Unfavorable Reactions From All Sides

The "50,000 yuan" and "100,000 yuan" denomination notes were originally scheduled to be released yesterday. However, the Central Bank decided to suspend them again due to unfavorable reactions from all sides, fearing that they would further stimulate prices when the cost of living index was announced. However, in order to solve the cash shortage, the 50,000 yuan and 100,000 yuan denomination notes will definitely be issued in the near future. (China Economic News Agency)

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, the city's money supply was initially loose in the morning, with daily interest rates of about 90 yuan to 100 yuan. Subsequently, due to soaring prices, there was strong demand for capital from all sides. Near noon, the National Bank sold more than 10,000 taels of gold, and money supply tightened slightly, with daily interest rates also rising to 150 yuan.

In the afternoon, due to the release of large amounts of cash, the banks also issued a large net outflow of 39.1 billion yuan. The money supply eased, and daily interest rates gradually rose to 70-80 yuan. Yesterday, the total input of various banks in the large exchange was 27.7 billion yuan, the net outflow of foreign firms was 2.9 billion yuan, and the net input of the small exchange was 14.3 billion yuan.

Exchange Certificates Rise: Up 44,000 from Previous Close

The exchange certificate market price rose sharply yesterday. The buying price at the opening in the morning was 70,000 yuan, rising to 88,000 yuan. Certificate holders were still unwilling to sell, and no transactions were made. It was not until nearly 11:00 that some transactions were made at 90,000 yuan. Subsequently, the highest price rose directly to 95,000 yuan, and the closing price decreased slightly to 91,000 yuan. The number of transactions yesterday was extremely small. Customers were watching due to the excessively high bid prices. The National Bank only dumped 100,000 yuan yesterday. It is reported that British HSBC Bank made more purchases. The market price rose sharply by 36,000 yuan compared to the previous noon close.

Tea Market Transactions Weak

Yesterday, the tea market saw weak transactions because money supply among the industry remained tight. In addition, salaries were about to be issued to employees after the index was announced. Buying activity suddenly decreased, and transactions declined again. However, the trend remained firmly in a quiet manner, and prices rose in a roundabout way. Because the prices of various goods outside the industry were soaring, sellers were reluctant to sell due to the steep increase in costs. The process moved forward repeatedly, but most of it was just empty bidding.

Coal Prices Adjusted

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Four Mines Joint Venture adjusted coal prices yesterday as follows:

Coal: 799,900 yuan, "Kai" Coal: 1,398,300 yuan, Foreign Coal: 1,779,100 yuan.

Cigarettes and Soap Soar

Cigarettes and soap rose across the board. The rise in prices in the previous market was driven by gold and foreign exchange. The sharp increase in the cost of living index made people bullish, and buying activity from all sides became stronger.

White "*" packs immediately broke through the 70,000 mark, soaring by 14,000 yuan. 20-piece "Da Ying" packs were at 27,800 yuan, also soaring by 7,000 yuan. Subsequently, the market gradually rose, and listed prices in the market increased by 3,000-5,000 yuan.

The price increase of soap became even more severe. "Gu Ben" soap was above 900,000 yuan, at 930,000 yuan, a surge of 230,000 yuan. Miscellaneous brands also rose sharply. "Mei Li" matches broke through the 3 million mark, at 3.8 million yuan, a surge of 1 million yuan. The rest also rose sharply by 500,000 to 1 million yuan.

Downstream Copper and Tin

Copper and tin market prices have long been shifting with the rise in gold and foreign exchange. Although the opening prices have recently been increasing, they have only been adding interest. The price chasing has been weak compared to gold and foreign exchange. As a result, local products, such as pure tin, native lead, and "Zi" lead, have become difficult to sell and have been declining. For example, pure tin once reached a high of 34 taels of gold per "*" (unit), native lead was 5.5 taels of gold, and "Zi" lead was 4.5 taels of gold as the pricing standard. Now, they have all fallen to 32 taels for pure tin, 4 taels for native lead, and 3 taels for "Zi" lead. The prices of imported goods are still related to foreign exchange.

Cotton Yarn Prices Rise Sharply: Cloth Market Buying Activity Surges

Yesterday, cotton yarn prices began to rise sharply. The tight money supply has eased, and with all goods outside the industry soaring, people are alarmed. All parties are holding onto their goods, and buyers have increased even more. Buying activity has surged, and sellers have taken the opportunity to raise prices, with all yarns rising by 50% to 60%.

42-count "Lan Feng" yarn initially broke through the 40 million yuan mark, reaching a new high. It then surged to 43 million yuan, closing at 42 million yuan, a sharp increase of 16 million yuan from before the suspension. 32-count "Yin Yue" yarn rose by 15 million yuan, closing at 28.5 million yuan.

32-count spot "Shuang Ma" yarn opened at 20 million yuan and reached a high of 24 million yuan, finally closing at 23.5 million yuan, a sharp increase of 10.4 million yuan. 20-count "Shuang Ma" yarn went straight to the 20 million mark from 19 million yuan. Finally, under favorable conditions, it broke through the mark and created a peak of 21.5 million yuan, a surge of 9.2 million yuan compared to before. The rise in prices for other yarns was unprecedented, with new highs frequently seen.

The rise in cloth prices was in full swing. Because the trend in money supply has eased and the authorities have admitted that 50,000 yuan and 100,000 yuan notes will be issued, people's hearts have been greatly encouraged. Buying activity in the market has surged, and holders of goods are unanimously bullish. Yesterday, the market fell into a frenzy, and prices jumped wildly.

At the initial opening in the morning, first-grade fine cloth was at 620,000 yuan, and "Si Jun Zi" serge was at 590,000 yuan. After opening, buyers actively sought goods, and sellers insisted on not selling. Buyers voluntarily increased their bids to absorb goods, with the former reaching a maximum of 790,000 yuan and the latter 760,000 yuan. Near noon, due to the excessive surge, people were wary of heights, and retail investors sold off some holdings, causing prices to show signs of fatigue. Finally, they rose again. The noon close was 700,000 yuan for first-grade fine cloth and 670,000 yuan for serge, a sharp increase of 60% each. After the close, prices increased by another 50

### Tongcheng Vessel Returns to Shanghai from Qingdao, Runs Aground Near Sheshan but Averted Danger. Boat Transporting Food Supplies Lost in Wind, Fourteen Employees Rescued and Arrived in Shanghai, One Salvage Worker Tragically Drowned.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Tongcheng Company's Tongcheng vessel returned to Shanghai from Qingdao last Saturday. The next day, it ran aground in the sea off Sheshan, seven nautical miles southwest of the island, due to dense fog and disorientation. The company immediately sent a telegram for help. On the 11th, the company requested the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to send the Ji'an vessel towing the iron barge No. 303. Twenty temporary salvage workers led by Captain Fan Lun left port on the morning of the 12th to rush to the scene of the accident to attempt rescue. However, because the water was shallow, the Ji'an vessel could not get close and had to anchor in deep water one nautical mile away. After Captain Fan Lun's study, it was necessary to dispatch a landing craft to assist, so he immediately telegraphed the headquarters. On the morning of the 14th, the landing craft No. 208 was dispatched to assist in the rescue. However, at this time, the Tongcheng vessel was running out of food supplies. On the evening of the 13th, a sampan carrying 14 employees was launched to transport food supplies from the Ji'an vessel. Unexpectedly, the weather suddenly changed, and the wind and waves rose suddenly. The sampan was small and could not be controlled, causing it to drift with the waves and disappear. The Ji'an vessel received the news and quickly weighed anchor and cruised around the area in search, but by the next morning, there was no trace. Fortunately, the landing craft No. 103, returning to Shanghai from Xiamen, spotted them near Litongsha and rescued all 14 people on the sampan and brought them to Shanghai. They arrived safely at the Qiujiang Wharf on the 14th. The Tongcheng vessel was also towed out of danger by No. 208 at 1:00 PM yesterday, and is now being towed back to Shanghai by the craft and is expected to enter the port this morning. The Ji'an vessel and the 303 iron barge completed their mission and returned to Shanghai yesterday. One of the twenty temporary salvage workers on the 303 iron barge, Yan Changgen, was hit by a wire cable and fell into the sea at 10:50 PM on the 13th while stowing the cable due to the high winds and waves. He could not be rescued in time and sank to the bottom of the sea. It is said that the deceased, Yan Changgen, was a local, 26 years old, and had elderly parents and was the only son of three families. His situation is very tragic. Yesterday afternoon, at around 4:00 PM, the family members went to the maritime department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, requesting to forward their request to the Tongcheng Company for compensation, but there has been no result yet.

### Rice Shop Apprentice Sentenced to Detention for Reducing Household Rice Rations

[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Zhurong, an apprentice at the Tianxing Rice Shop in this city, was instigated by the shop owner, Cao Tianyi, to tamper with the scales used for weighing rice to reduce the amount of rice allocated to households. On the 16th of last month, residents of the district, Pan Jinshan, Ying Mingyou, Wu Peiyuan, and others, went to the shop with ration purchase certificates to buy household rice. Chen weighed and delivered the rice, and each was shorted several catties of rice. After the police station in charge found out, the shop owner, Cao Tianyi, fled without a trace.

### Chaotic Rice Price Bidding, Social Bureau Inquires and Corrects, Instructs Rice Industry Leaders on Two Points

Yesterday, the price of rice in the market reached 550,000 yuan per picul due to the increase in prices in the production areas and the rise in gold and silver yuan. However, the supply was scarce, and all transactions were moved off-site. The retail prices were very chaotic, generally above 700,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Cao, the head of the Social Bureau, specially summoned the managers of the north and south markets and the responsible persons of the Rice Business Association to inquire about the rice price increases. Mr. Cao also gave two instructions: (1) The Social Bureau has received reports that the rice market is exchanging one tael of gold for eight piculs and five pecks of rice, which is extremely illegal. If this continues, small rice shops will not be able to operate. He sternly reprimanded the market managers and ordered them to pay attention to cracking down on this. (2) The retail prices lack any standard and should also be corrected. The retail prices of each rice shop should be restrained.

### Rationed Rice Shops to Hang Signs, Civil Survey Office Standardizes Style

[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to facilitate citizens' purchase of household rice, the Civil Survey Office has stipulated that each rationed rice shop must hang a sign indicating the amount and price of rationed rice.

### Water Police Bureau Patrol Officer Under Investigation for Demanding Rice from Shipping Companies

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Ruren, a patrol officer of the Water Police Bureau from Zhuji, 29 years old, joined the force on January 20th of this year. His duty was to patrol and guide ships traveling to and from the Suzhou Creek. Soon after taking office, Wang ordered his subordinates to "spread the word" to various shipping companies, saying that each company should "show respect" to him with two piculs of white rice. Otherwise, if any ships travel to and from the Suzhou Creek, he would make things difficult for them. Three or four days before the Lunar New Year, Wang invited personnel from Lichuan, Jiangxing, Dada, and other companies to meet at the Bund Park to discuss the matter. At that time, each company was only willing to offer seven pecks of rice as a year-end bonus, so the meeting ended unhappily. Later, several companies paid two piculs of rice to show their accommodation, while others ignored him. He then deliberately created difficulties for them, which led to disputes and police reports. The District Prosecutor's Office investigated and prosecuted him for corruption by abusing his authority. The trial opened yesterday in the District Court, and all shipping companies sent representatives to testify in court. After the court reviewed the evidence, it ordered that the suspect be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing.
