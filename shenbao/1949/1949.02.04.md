### Yan Huiqing and Others to Fly to Peiping Tomorrow; Shao Lizi and Gan Jiehou to Travel on the Same Flight; The Peiping People's Delegation Will Travel North from Qingdao Today

[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai Peace Delegation is scheduled to fly to Peiping on the 5th via military aircraft from Shanghai. Among the five delegates, Mr. Leng Yuqiu cannot participate due to the upcoming Jiangsu Provincial Assembly meeting. Although Mr. Yan Huiqing is of advanced age, he is determined to go. For safety along the way, a doctor will accompany him. In addition to the four delegates, Shao Lizi and Gan Jiehou will fly north on the same plane to assist in the negotiations. Mr. Shao is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Peiping on the 4th and depart together. Mr. Gan, starting at 5:00 PM yesterday, had tea with Yan Huiqing and other delegates at Yan's residence. In addition to agreeing on the travel schedule, they also discussed various preparations for the negotiations. After the meeting, they visited President Sun at Columbia Road at 6:00 PM for a sincere discussion on the overall situation, which lasted for more than two hours, returning to the International Hotel for rest around 8:00 PM. When a reporter interviewed Mr. Gan, asking if the trip to Peiping by the Shanghai representatives had been approved by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Mr. Gan said he could not comment, but stated, "If the CCP did not agree, how could the departure date be determined?" Mr. Gan denied that the organization of the Shanghai delegation was due to the CCP's suggestion, saying that it was the government's initiative. He said that the price of peace was inconvenient to discuss, but he personally believed that the possibility of peace was very high. In addition, Mr. Gan's mission to Shanghai was not limited to one item. However, as of yesterday, he had not yet consulted with the China Democratic League and other party members. With the decision made on the date of the peace delegation's flight north, the initial task has come to a conclusion. He is scheduled to fly to Peiping on the morning of the 4th to report back and consult Acting President Li on everything, returning to Shanghai in the afternoon.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 3rd] After Shao Lizi returned to Peiping, he reported to Acting President Li on the 2nd. On the 3rd, he stayed quietly at home without any activities. Regarding the rumors that he had been invited to go to Peiping in a private capacity with Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, Chen Guangfu, and Jiang Yong, Mr. Shao stated that he had not received a formal invitation from the five individuals, but he could consider it. Furthermore, the "Jing Evening News" reported on the 3rd that Acting President Li had asked Mr. Shao to go to Peiping in a private capacity to convey Acting President Li's sincerity in seeking peace. After inquiries, it was learned that this was a misunderstanding that Yan, Zhang, Chen, and others had invited him to travel together.

[Our Newspaper Qingdao, 2nd] The Peiping People's Peace Delegation, including Qiu Zhizhong and others, were unable to travel yesterday due to concerns from the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC). At noon on the 3rd, they spoke with the Peiping Joint Office via the Ministry of Transportation's long-distance wireless telephone. They asked Xue Zizheng to answer the call, but Xue was not in the office, so Chief of Staff Zhou Beifeng spoke with them. They told Peiping the reasons why they could not arrive in Peiping on the 1st and said that if they could not come by plane, they would change to land travel. However, the bureau replied that it was determined to ensure the safety of the CNAC plane and welcomed them to arrive in Peiping immediately. The delegation also spoke with Ao Shipeng, the person in charge of the CNAC in Peiping, who said that a safe landing was absolutely possible. The CNAC side has directly contacted them and decided to fly the delegation to Peiping on the 4th. The delegation told reporters, "What we are talking about is comprehensive peace, not partial peace."

[United Press Nanjing, 3rd] Qiu Changwei, advisor to Acting President Li, denied on the 3rd the rumors that Acting President Li had dispatched a private representative with a "secret mission" to contact the Communist Army Headquarters in Huaiyin and persuade the Communist Army not to attack while the government was attempting to seek peace. Mr. Qiu stated: "This rumor is completely unfounded." According to a certain news agency (not United Press), General Li Mingyang has gone to Huaiyin on a peace mission.

[Our Newspaper Taipei, 3rd] It is reported that Cheng Siyuan will come to Taiwan from Peiping on the 4th via special plane. He represents Acting President Li to solicit Chairman Chen's opinions on the current situation.

### The Executive Yuan Begins Official Business in Guangzhou; Sun Ke to Go to Arrange Matters; Telegram Replying to Yu Youren and Tong Guanxian, Hoping They Will Go to Guangzhou Immediately

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, 3rd] The Executive Yuan has formally announced that it will begin official business in Guangzhou. The Yuan's address is temporarily located at the Yingbin (Guest) Hall on Zhonghua North Road, Guangzhou.

[Central News Agency Guangzhou, 3rd] The heads of ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan who have relocated to Guangzhou and senior officials held a symposium at 10:00 AM on the 3rd to discuss the issue of work contact with personnel remaining in Peiping.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 3rd] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stopped all external official document exchanges in Peiping at 5:00 PM on the 3rd and is scheduled to officially begin official business in Guangzhou starting on the morning of the 5th. Political Vice Minister Ye Gongchao and the directors of the Intelligence, Protocol, and General Affairs Departments will continue to stay in Peiping to maintain contact with the Presidential Office and foreign envoys in Peiping, and to handle the relocation of the diplomatic corps to the south and the evacuation of the ministry itself. On the morning of the 3rd, a special plane was originally scheduled to transport the personnel of the French and Dutch embassies to Guangzhou, but the flight was unsuccessful due to a temporary aircraft malfunction.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 3rd] Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, and Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan, telegraphed Sun Ke, President of the Executive Yuan, on the 1st, asking him to return to Peiping to jointly plan for major strategies to facilitate peace talks. On the 3rd, President Sun's reply telegram arrived in Peiping, stating that the government had relocated to Guangzhou and that he needed to go there to make arrangements, but he could return to Peiping at any time thereafter. The text of President Sun's reply telegram is as follows: To Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, and Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan: I have received your telegram of the first day of the second month. The government's relocation to Guangzhou for official business has been decided by the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting and has been notified to the envoys of various countries stationed in China. The relocation has recently been completed. I need to go to Guangzhou to make some arrangements, and Vice President Wu Tiecheng and I can return to Peiping at any time to jointly promote peace. The Legislative Yuan's meeting is approaching, and I have sent a special person to be responsible for the transport. Also, when will the Control Yuan relocate to Guangzhou? I hope you will send someone to contact and hope that the two gentlemen will go to Guangzhou as soon as possible to preside over matters. Sincerely, Sun Ke.

[Central News Agency, This City] The government's relocation to Guangzhou is being actively carried out. The addresses of the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan members in Guangzhou have been notified to the local government by the Executive Yuan to find suitable hotels. Transportation is also being coordinated by the Yuan. Members will make as much use of air transport as possible, and family members and staff will be transported separately by cars and ships.

### Xue Yue Telegrams Acting President Li to Clarify Associated Press Telegram

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 3rd] Xue Yue, Chairman of Guangdong, telegraphed Acting President Li on the 3rd to clarify and explain the content of his talk published by the Associated Press on the 31st. In his telegram, Mr. Xue reported to Acting President Li that the content of the talk published by the Associated Press was inaccurate. He also stated that the local area has no opinions on the major plans for peace and war, and that everything is based on the central government's decisions, and the local area should obey the central government's decisions.

[Ta Kung Pao Guangzhou, 3rd] Chairman Xue Yue recently hosted reporters for the first time, revealing his administrative guidelines. The content was roughly the same as his report to the Provincial Assembly yesterday. He continued, "Being appointed to lead Guangdong this time is like 'a cow climbing a tree'." However, he has the determination to sacrifice himself to save Guangdong and save the country. In the future, his administration will adhere to the three principles of political freedom, economic democracy, and military self-defense, and all financial budgets, personnel appointments, and handling of affairs will be absolutely transparent. When reporters asked about reports in some Hong Kong Chinese newspapers that he had told Associated Press reporters that he had announced the independence of the four provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Fujian, Mr. Xue replied that the reports were quite different from his original intention in the conversation. The Associated Press correspondent in Guangzhou also stated that only some Hong Kong Chinese newspapers had mistranslated the original intention. Finally, Mr. Xue called for strengthening unity, saying, "We must work hard together in life and go our separate ways in death."

### The Southern Section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Remains Calm; National Army in Nantong Voluntarily Withdraws from the Urban Area; Rumor Has It That Regular Communist Army Troops on the North Bank of the Yangtze River Are Retreating North

[Our Newspaper Puzhen, 3rd] The National Army in the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is still firmly defending Xige and the area south of it. The main force of the Communist Army is north of Chuxian. On the 3rd, there was only plainclothes activity on both sides in the Wuyi Town area. The Communist side sent about a hundred people to the area.

[Our Newspaper Puzhen, 3rd] Regarding the movements of the Communist Army between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, according to the comprehensive reports obtained from various sources in this area, the publicized situation is as follows: stationed between Bengbu and Jiashan on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway are Chen Yi's four columns, the 4th, 7th, 8th, and 13th. The 9th Column is located between Jiashan and Chuxian. Chuxian is occupied by the local Communist Huainan Independent Brigade. The 1st Column is in Quanjiao. The 2nd, 3rd, Rapid, and Bohai columns are located in the southwest area of Tianchang and Gaoyou Lake. The 11th and 12th columns are near Shaobo. The Yangtze River Column is in Jingjiang and Nantong. The remaining areas of Luhe, Yangzhou, and Taixing are each garrisoned by local Communists numbering from five or six hundred to over a thousand. Looking at the overall strength of the Communist Army, excluding the local Communists, its regular army has a total of thirteen columns. Although there are many numbers, it is judged here that after the three major battles around Xuzhou, its main force was almost completely lost, especially the casualties of middle and lower-level cadres were heavy. At the very least, without a relatively long period of rest and reorganization, it would be impossible to restore its original combat power.

[United Press Nanjing, 3rd] The Communist Army's pressure on the Yangtze River line has been reduced on the 3rd. The Communist Army has retreated north in some locations. The Communist columns in the Hubei-Henan area have withdrawn, allowing the National Army to reoccupy Xinyang. The regular Communist Army troops north of the capital area have also retreated, leaving only a few local Communists. Yizheng was once rumored to be three-quarters occupied by the Communist Army, but on the 3rd, it was reported that there was no trace of the Communist Army. It is said that Yangzhou is occupied by a thousand local Communists. The only small contact along the north bank of the Yangtze River is reported to be in the area east of Pukou. The reason for the Communist Army's retreat is unknown.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 3rd] Regarding Nantong, after the National Army voluntarily withdrew from the urban area at the end of last month, on the night of the 31st, about a thousand soldiers from three regiments, 104, 105, and 106, belonging to the Communist Army's Yangtze River Column, harassed the Langshan and Jinshan areas from Xingren Town, northeast of Nantong City. They were repelled by Gu Xijiu's troops of the National Army. As of the evening of the 1st, Jin and Lang mountains were still firmly defended by the National Army, and the Communist Army retreated to the eastern part of Nantong City. In addition, more than three thousand soldiers from three regiments, 101, 102, and 103, also belonging to the Yangtze River Column of the Communist Army, scurried from Huangqiao, northeast of Taixing, to the Baiyitang area of Jingjiang on the night of the 31st. The National Army has been paying attention to them.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 3rd] Liu Jizhi, the county magistrate of Hengshan County, newly established by the Chinese Communists at the junction of Jiangning and Dangtu, is leading more than four hundred local Communists and has been active in the Yuntai Mountain and Hengshan area in recent days. The National Army has dispatched troops to encircle and suppress them.

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 3rd] Yesterday, some newspapers in Peiping and Shanghai carried a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 1st, saying that the Navy had shelled Yizheng County and the county magistrate was injured. This reporter recently met with Lin, the commander of the Navy stationed in Zhen, who said that as of now, the city is still firmly defended by the National Army and local teams, and the joint defense by the Navy and Army is very complete, so there is no reason to shell it. County Magistrate Zuo Zhiren is currently in Zhen asking for reinforcements and weapons and is not injured in the slightest.

[Our Newspaper Jiangyin, 3rd] At 1:00 AM on the morning of the 2nd, the Communist Army in Jingjiang harassed the National Army in Bawu Port and was repelled. The situation in Chengdi is still safe, but the number of people fleeing to Shanghai is increasing daily.

### Zhang Qun Flies from Peiping to Chongqing; Chongqing-Suiyuan District to Hold a Meeting to Discuss Strengthening Sichuan's Defense; Gu Zhutong Telegrams Chongqing to Raise Alert

[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 3rd] Zhang Qun flew from Peiping to Chongqing at 12:30 PM on the 3rd. His trip was very secret. Deng Xihou and others were supposed to attend Lu Zuofu's banquet at noon, but only Zhang Xiang, Director of the Chongqing Telecommunications Bureau, went to Baishiyi Airport to welcome him back to the Presidential Residence in Zengjiayan for rest. Mr. Zhang refused to meet with reporters. Fan Songyao and Liao Kaitao visited Mr. Zhang to report on the situation of the Pacification Headquarters. In addition, the city government decided to send Director Wang Liankui to Guanglongtan Temple on the 4th to bring Yang Sen back to Chongqing.

[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 3rd] Important resolutions of the Suiyuan Headquarters meeting: (1) Evacuate Yichang materials as soon as possible; (2) Important matters will be decided by Zhang Qun.

[Our Newspaper Chengdu, 3rd] In order to consolidate Sichuan's defense, the authorities will convene a Chongqing District Pacification Conference. Zhang Qun, Hu Zongnan, Sun Zhen, Wang Lingji, Liu Wenhui, Yang Sen, and Deng Xihou will all participate.

[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 3rd] This area received a telegram from Chief of General Staff Gu Zhutong stating: (1) Before the realization of peace and the army is guaranteed, vigilance should be heightened, and war preparations should not be relaxed. (2) The local security should strictly implement martial law. (3) Firmly grasp the troops, maintain close contact with friendly forces, and telegraph at any time.

[Our Newspaper Chengdu, 2nd] In order to prepare for emergencies, Sichuan Province has decided to add seven armies, restoring the former Sichuan Army system. The designated generals are Chen Chunlin, Fan Shaozeng, Yang Hanyu, Wan Li, Deng Yamin, and Xu Zhenggang. They will be under the control of the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters. The source of troops is being conscripted and trained by the military control area.

### Ministry of National Defense Announces: A Week's War Situation

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 3rd] The Ministry of National Defense recently announced the war situation for the week from January 27 to February 2 as follows:

This week, due to the Spring Festival, there were only minor contacts on various lines and no major battles. The National Army still adheres to the principle of preparing for war and seeking peace. In addition to consolidating the Yangtze River defense, no new actions have been taken. The general situation of the war is as follows:

On the Yangtze River front, the Communist Army is moving frequently. Currently, on the north bank of the Yangtze River, from Nantong in the east to Quanjiao in the west, Chen Yi's Communist Army has about ten columns. The 1st, 4th, 7th, and 13th columns are in the Chuxian and Quanjiao area. The 2nd, 3rd, Bohai, and Rapid columns are in the Tianhe and Luhe area. In addition, the 11th and 12th columns are located in northern Jiangsu. The Yangtze River Detachment is actively harassing various places along the Yangtze River from Nantong to Taixing. On the 28th, the National Army voluntarily withdrew from Rugao, and on the 2nd, it withdrew from Nantong, strengthening the bridgehead positions north of the Yangtze River. Some of the Communist Army units appear to be actively preparing to cross the Yangtze River, while most of them are reorganizing and replenishing in the Huai River area. As of now, it seems that there are no troops with the strength to cross the Yangtze River and invade the south. Our powerful naval, land, and air forces have closely coordinated and completed deployments to monitor the Communist Army on the north bank. At the same time, our advanced bases on the north bank of the Yangtze River are very strong. The main force of the National Army in the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is still firmly defending the areas of Pukou and Zhenjiang.

In Central China, the Communist Army Liu Bocheng's old units, the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 9th, and 10th columns, a total of five columns, have gone to southern Henan for reorganization and replenishment. Together with the local Communist forces of Zhang Tixue, Wang Shusheng, and Luo Houfu, they have been attacking the Huangchuan and Guangshan area in recent days, attempting to threaten Xinyang. The National Army in Queshan once retreated, but after receiving reinforcements, it reoccupied the area on the 1st. In western Hubei, the Communist Army's Third Brigade attempted to harass Zhushan but was repelled. The National Army in Central China has strict deployments. If the Communist Army dares to act recklessly, it will be difficult to achieve its goals.

In the Taiyuan area, the Communist Army around Pingyao is actively deploying, seemingly preparing to launch another offensive. However, most of the Communist Army in the area are replenished by militiamen from various places in central Shanxi, and their strength is very weak. If they rashly launch an offensive, they will probably be unable to escape the fate of failure like the past six offensives.

Overall, although there have been no major battles in various places in the past week, the development of the overall situation, whether for peace or war, is extremely noteworthy. The National Army follows the government's policy of preparing for war and seeking peace and will never give others an opportunity to take advantage of. Therefore, the key to peace or war in the future still depends on whether the Communist Party has sincerity for peace. On the part of the National Army, it has done its best.

### Li Yannian Still Stationed in Puzhen; Zhang Gan's Army Corps Not Transferred East; A Certain Military Person in Charge Solemnly Tells Reporters

[Our Newspaper Puzhen, 3rd] This reporter recently inquired with a certain important person in charge here regarding a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 1st, carried by various Chinese and foreign newspapers in Shanghai, stating that Zhang Gan's Guangxi troops had replaced General Li Yannian's troops on January 31 to take over the defense of Pukou and Puzhen, and that Li Yannian's army corps had moved to the south bank. According to him, as of 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, they had not yet received any orders from the Ministry of National Defense or the Garrison Headquarters of Peiping, Shanghai, and Hangzhou regarding this matter. Currently, General Li Yannian is still stationed here. Except for the two armies of Yang Gancai and Hu Changqing, which have been transferred to the south bank to strengthen the defenses around the capital, the remaining army of Yu Zhaolong and the newly assigned army of Liu Bingzhe (originally under the command of the Capital Garrison Headquarters and also served as commander of the Pukou and Zhenjiang area, but not a Guangxi troop) are still under the command of General Li. The bridgeheads on the north bank of the Yangtze River in the Pukou and Zhenjiang area are narrow, and there is actually no need to station too many troops. With the current troop strength, combined with the absolutely dominant naval and air forces, it is more than enough to defend the capital's gateway. People south of the Yangtze River really do not need to worry unnecessarily, causing themselves to panic. A certain person in charge solemnly told reporters at this point: Zhang Gan's army corps is indeed one of the most outstanding army corps in the National Army. As far as he knows, the army corps is currently still in southern Henan and has recently been ordered to cooperate with Zhang Zhen's troops to fight in Henan.

### U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Ramsay Scheduled to Fly to Qingdao Today; to Hold Secret Meeting with Badger

[United Press Manila, 3rd] The gradual withdrawal of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps from China seems to be only a matter of time. U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Ramsay inspected here today and is scheduled to fly to Qingdao at 6:00 AM tomorrow to hold a series of secret meetings with U.S. Navy Commander for the Western Pacific Badger. According to Ramsay, this trip to Qingdao is purely for an on-the-spot inspection of the situation in China. If the Western Pacific Fleet abandons the ports of China, it will relocate to the Japan, Okinawa, Guam, and Philippines area.

[Associated Press Manila, 3rd] U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Ramsay will go to Shanghai on the morning of the 4th and then to Qingdao and will go to Tokyo to meet MacArthur. During their stay in China, Ramsay and others will meet with Vice Admiral Badger. It is reported that Ramsay will discuss the overall situation in the Pacific with MacArthur and Vice Admiral Badger.

### Xinyang Restored to its Former Appearance

Southern Refugees Return Home

[Ta Kung Pao Xinyang, 3rd] Xinyang has been restored to its former appearance. Upon hearing of the arrival of Zhang Gan's army corps, refugees who had moved south are returning home one after another. Henan provincial government officials who must work in Xinyang are also returning to Xinyang from Wuhan one after another. Local postal, telecommunications, and transportation can be restored to normal.

### Peiping Communist Army Parade

[United Press Peiping, 3rd] The Communist Army held a victory parade here on the 3rd. The streets were crowded with spectators, and the procession was several miles long. Almost all the vehicles used were American-style, including jeeps, dispatch cars, hospital cars, and ordnance cars. Most of the gun carriages and anti-aircraft gun carriages were Japanese-style. Civilians also participated in the parade, shouting slogans and performing costumed performances. Most of the procession passed through Dongjiaominxiang.

[Associated Press Peiping, 3rd] The first restriction announced by the new Peiping government on the evening of the 2nd was to prohibit the taking of photographs of Communist military units and military activities. Both Chinese and foreign residents must comply with this order, with the exception of commissioned Communist Army reporters. The official list of CCP local authorities has been published in local newspapers:

Peiping-Tianjin Frontline Headquarters: Commander Lin Biao, Political Commissar Luo Ronghuan.

Peiping-Tianjin Garrison Headquarters: Commander Nie Rongzhen, Political Commissar Bo Yibo.

Peiping Military Control Committee: Chairman Ye Jianying, Vice Chairman Tan Zheng.

It is widely believed that Fu Zuoyi is currently not in Peiping. It is rumored that he has flown to his old base in Inner Mongolia, presumably with CCP permission.

### Tianjin CCP Authorities Refuse to Meet with Foreign Consuls

[United Press Peiping, 3rd] Visitors from Tianjin say: The Communist Army authorities refuse to accept formal visits from foreign consuls, with the exception of the Soviet consul. The Communist side announced that it would not meet with foreign representatives until the new Chinese government was recognized.

### Chengdu Circles Begin to Prepare to Form the Comprehensive Peace Promotion Association

[Central News Agency Chengdu, 3rd] The Sichuan Provincial Assembly convened leaders from all circles in Chengdu on the morning of the 3rd to hold a symposium to promote peace. More than 70 representatives and provincial assembly members attended. Chairman Xiang Chuanyi presided. They unanimously emphasized that both the government and the CCP have expressed their willingness to make peace, and the people need peace even more urgently. Therefore, efforts should be made to promote the realization of peace, especially hoping that peace is comprehensive, not partial, and permanent, not temporary. Finally, it was decided to organize an institution to promote comprehensive peace, and preparatory work began immediately.

### Huang Xuchu Flies to Wuhan

[Our Newspaper Guilin, 3rd] At the invitation of Commander-in-Chief Bai, Guangxi Chairman Huang Xuchu flew to Wuhan on the morning of the 3rd with Finance Director Wei Zhitang on a special plane to discuss important matters.

### Fujian Civil Defense Headquarters Established

[Our Newspaper Fuzhou, 3rd] The Fujian Provincial Civil Defense Headquarters has recently been established. Zhu Shaoliang serves as commander concurrently, and Neng Jue serves as deputy commander. It has three sections: Organization and Training, Communications, and General Affairs. The central tasks are to organize and train the public and strengthen protection work.

### Myanmar Embassy Plans to Temporarily Close

[Our Newspaper Kunming, 2nd] Due to the unstable situation in China, the Myanmar Embassy in Peiping plans to temporarily close down and establish an office in Kunming first. Secretary Zhao Nongka has arrived in Kunming and is actively making arrangements.

### Foreign Correspondents Look at China: Unlikely to Become a Strong Police State, but Long-Term Struggle Between US and USSR Unavoidable

[United Press International Former Shanghai Correspondent Logan and Former Beijing Correspondent Gorey, New York, 3rd] The ultimate outcome of the Communist Party's occupation of all of China is generally unknowable, but many believe that the basic lifestyles of China's 450 million people will not change immediately. The increased influence of the Soviet Union in the Far East and the decline of American prestige in the Far East will be the most significant results of the CCP's victory. Simultaneously, a long-term struggle between East and West for influence over the world is clearly unavoidable.

The CCP's victory gives the Soviet Union a tremendous advantage in this struggle, but some who are familiar with China say: Although CCP leader Mao Zedong is linked to Moscow, he puts his Chinese identity first and the Communist Party second. Based on this view, they believe that China is unlikely to become a strong police state, and therefore do not worry as much as others do. It is reported that American officials also harbor similar hopes.

Regardless of the outcome of the long-term struggle, the following immediate results are almost certain to occur after the CCP's complete victory:

(1) The establishment of a "united government" absolutely controlled by the CCP. Free individuals or even former Kuomintang leaders will be included, but they will have no power to veto CCP proposals.

(2) A ruthless liquidation of the Kuomintang. The CCP has long demanded this as the price of peace. CCP propaganda has also severely denounced the "Four Big Families of Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen," accusing them of stealing 20 billion US dollars from China in the past twenty years.

(3) Proposals regarding foreign capital and businesses in China. The CCP urgently needs consumer goods, heavy industrial machinery, and foreign investment to rebuild the shattered nation. Mao Zedong has stated in the past that China must go through a "recovery" phase with the help of private capital before it can implement full socialist programs, but foreign businesses will inevitably be subject to strict controls.

(4) Strict adherence to the party program, promoting land and education reform. These two policies are the basic policies implemented in the CCP-occupied areas. In some areas of China, there has been strong peasant resistance to these two policies. Therefore, this plan may be implemented in a gradual manner to prevent resistance and loss of public confidence.

Editorial

### Peace? Surrender?

The atmosphere of peace has been confusing in the past month. The more everyone hopes for peace, the more unattainable it seems. The reason for this lies in the fact that everyone has not clearly distinguished between peace talks and surrender in their minds. Therefore, regarding the current situation, we must first discuss: What preparations is the government making for the CCP? Peace? Or Surrender?

What is peace? When both sides of a war feel that military force ultimately cannot solve national affairs, and especially feel that the suffering of the people is too great and cannot continue to sacrifice the people, they resolutely abandon military means and instead use political methods to negotiate all major national plans, in order to reduce the suffering of the people. This is peace. Therefore, the starting points of peace are three: (1) Both sides are entirely thinking of the people; (2) Both sides thoroughly realize that military force cannot be relied upon indefinitely; (3) Both sides recognize each other's equal status.

What is surrender? When one side of a war realizes that it has completely lost its ability to fight, and recognizes the other side as the completely victorious conqueror, it lays down its arms and submits to all of the other side's commands, without considering what impact the result will have on the people. This is surrender. Therefore, the starting points of surrender are also three: (1) Not truly thinking of the people; (2) Due to military defeat; (3) Voluntarily abandoning its equal status.

Being clear about this, we can examine why comprehensive peace is currently attainable but still out of reach. The reason is that the three starting points of peace do not seem to be fully present. Because they are not present, peace clearly still faces obstacles. We only need to review the following series of facts to understand: (1) President Chiang's New Year's Day message advocated peace, pointed out five principles of peace, and stated that his personal position was not a concern, filling the people of the entire country with joy, believing that the dawn of peace had appeared. (2) However, after two weeks, the CCP broadcast Mr. Mao Zedong's eight conditions for peace talks, including "punishing war criminals," on January 14, and the dawn seemed to be obscured again. (3) On the 19th, the Executive Yuan hoped that both sides would immediately cease fire and send representatives to conduct peace talks. (4) On the 21st, President Chiang resolutely "stepped down first, in the hope of ending the war," with Vice President Li acting on his behalf to continue seeking peace. (5) On the 22nd, the government appointed Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, and three others as representatives to await the CCP's response regarding the dispatch of representatives and the designated location. (6) On the 22nd, Acting President Li also issued a message, "Seeking the realization of peace with the highest sincerity and greatest effort." He also issued an edict deciding to implement seven measures, including abolishing the Special Criminal Tribunal and releasing political prisoners, to show sincerity in seeking peace. (7) However, on the 25th, the CCP broadcast criticized the government's pursuit of peace as hypocritical, and said that the number of "war criminals" was not limited to forty-three. On the 26th, the CCP broadcast added many more "war criminals," and demanded that the government arrest them first. (8) On the 27th, Acting President Li still telegraphed Mr. Mao Zedong, appealing for the people, and acknowledging that the CCP's eight conditions could be used as the basis for peace talks. Logically, since Mr. Mao had previously said that "the Kuomintang should abandon its 'reactionary' conditions and acknowledge the eight conditions proposed by the Chinese Communist Party as the basis for both sides to engage in peace talks," the CCP should have designated representatives to conduct peace talks with the government after Acting President Li telegraphed acknowledging this as the basis. (9) However, the CCP broadcast a statement on the 29th, emphasizing that the immediate arrest of the "war criminals" by name was a prerequisite (these forty-three people included Acting President Li and President Sun himself), and that "liquidation" and "struggle" must be carried out. But it never mentioned designating representatives. (10) On the first, the government replied to the CCP's statement, still hoping that the CCP would also use the highest sincerity to promote the early opening of peace talks. Acting President Li also flew to Shanghai on the same day, inviting Dr. Yan Huiqing and four others to go to Peiping in a private capacity to inquire about the CCP's intentions, but to this day, the CCP has not shown any indication of sending representatives, and the five representatives in Shanghai have not flown to Peiping, while the trip to Peiping by the Nanjing people's representatives has already been turned away in Qingdao.

Based on the above description of facts, the reader should know that the obstacle to peace lies in the CCP's self-perception as the complete conqueror. If this idea is allowed to develop, the CCP will no longer consider the suffering of the people from the war, and will be confident that its military force can unify China, and will not need to treat the National Government led by Acting President Li as an equal. If this idea is allowed to develop, in the CCP's eyes, Acting President Li is no better than Okamura Neiji. Because when Okamura Neiji, on the orders of the Japanese Emperor, led his imperial army in China to surrender, he did not first arrest himself or offer his own head to pay homage to our receiving officer.

We believe that after President Chiang retreated to his rural home, Acting President Li continued his ambition, leading the people in striving for peace, not surrender. We further hope that the CCP leaders will see this clearly, accept Acting President Li's sincerity, and seek the realization of comprehensive peace. If the CCP does not do this, and insists on playing out a "surrender" ceremony, then we, the common people, deeply fear that the government may not be willing to surrender, and the people will suffer from the war again due to the CCP's mistake, and be trapped in an irrecoverable situation.

On the government's side, if it is willing to surrender regardless of the future harm to the people, then so be it. Otherwise, it should do its best to seek equal peace. So how can equal peace be achieved? Simply put: First, earnestly unite internally; second, fully defend the Yangtze River; third, thoroughly clarify politics and resolve to start anew with the people; fourth, implement the Principle of People's Livelihood and stabilize social order. At least it must be done in this earnest, practical, and hard-working way, so that the military and the people can cooperate, restore its own strong power, show people that it cannot be easily humiliated, can fight without having to fight, and then engage in peace, and only then can equal and genuine peace be achieved. Otherwise, it's just surrender, what peace is there to speak of?

### ECA Office Ordered to Close, Robert Smith and Griffin Arrive in Taiwan for Inspection

[Our newspaper, Taipei, 3rd] Economic Cooperation Administration Director Robert Smith, along with Deputy Director Griffin and industrial economics experts Green and Johnston, arrived in Taiwan on a special plane at approximately 11:00 AM this morning. Secretary-General Pu, Director Yan, and the American Consul-General all went to the airport to greet them. Smith and others are here to inspect the Keelung Port fertilizer factory and the electricity project, and are scheduled to return to Shanghai on Sunday.

[City News] A spokesman for the Economic Cooperation Administration's China Mission said on the 3rd that the Peiping office has indeed been ordered to close, a decision made locally by office director Davis. The situation at the Tianjin office is unclear; communication has been cut off since Communist forces occupied Tianjin on January 22.

[United Press, Peiping, 3rd] The Economic Cooperation Administration's Peiping office received an order from the Shanghai headquarters yesterday to close immediately; the reason was not stated. Office Director Davis informed staff that this month's salary would be paid on the 4th, at which time Shanghai plans to send a plane to Peiping to evacuate personnel who wish to leave Peiping. Foreigners believe that the closure order was likely issued from Washington. According to visitors from Tianjin, ECA materials in the city have been seized by Communist forces and distributed without the agency's consent. The closure of the Peiping office may be motivated by this. The ECA plane still requires the permission of the Communist authorities to come to Peiping.

[United Press, Nanjing, 3rd] Official sources said today that the Communist authorities' confiscation of Economic Cooperation Administration grain reserves in Peiping and Tianjin is likely to affect American relief activities in other parts of China. It is reported that the Communist forces will receive 150,000 bags of flour from the Tianjin ECA, the same amount as in Peiping. Economic Cooperation Administration's China Mission Director Robert Smith has not yet made any statement regarding the future direction of relief efforts.

[United Press, Taipei, 3rd] Economic Cooperation Administration's Taiwan Mission Director Craig told a United Press reporter today that although the situation on the Chinese mainland is turbulent, the agency's programs in Taiwan have increased rather than decreased. The original plan did not include water conservancy and afforestation, but these have now been added, and surveying will begin as soon as surveying personnel arrive. The fertilizer and railway programs are still in the preliminary investigation stage, while practical work has already begun on the electricity project. The Economic Cooperation Administration's industrial department may establish a factory in Taiwan, and it is expected that the engineering team from American Widell Company and the Sino-American Joint Railway Committee will arrive in Taiwan soon.

### Improvement of Sichuan Rural Villages, Work Has Begun, Dr. James Yen Speaks

[Our Paper Report] According to this question ECA news: Dr. James Yen, a member of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, made the following remarks yesterday on the New Rural Village Improvement Program in the Third District of Sichuan Province, which is supported by the Commission: "The interest of the people has been aroused. This plan is not being imposed on the local people from the outside. The local people need this plan. Basic techniques for improving rural villages have begun to be developed. Local leaders are also being trained." American member Morris Earl said, "Experience has shown that a complete plan is necessary for truly improving people's lives." The basic work of the Rural Reconstruction Commission is to "cooperate with existing institutions to establish a concept of what should be done to improve rural villages, and to establish necessary institutions to implement it." Like the Commission's other projects, the Third District project will not end when its current work is completed. Based on this plan, the Commission will establish a fund to continue implementing the rural village plan in Sichuan Province. The fund will be used to lend to or assist various projects, and its source will be the repayment of loans from the Commission or the fund by the people.

[City News] A comprehensive plan to improve the lives of five million Chinese farmers in the Third District of Sichuan Province has begun with the support of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction. This plan improves rural villages in a comprehensive way, rather than in a piecemeal way. This plan will focus on the five main goals of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, namely agriculture, farmland leasing, local autonomy, administration, health care, and adult social education. The Mass Education Movement has laid a foundation for this plan, because the Mass Education Movement engaged in a plan after the war. The Third District is adjacent to Chongqing and includes ten counties and one special zone. The new plan will begin work in this area where experiments have been carried out. With the joint efforts of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction and the local area, the following plans will be possible: (1) Establish two hundred new production cooperatives to solve the problem of agricultural tenancy. (2) Educate more than 1.9 million illiterate adults and out-of-school children in the Third District. (3) Protect and improve the health of the people in the Third District. (4) Assist the textile cooperative movement to grow in Bishan County. (5) Open up small irrigation areas. (6) Increase the number of livestock in the area.

Chengdu [Our Paper, 3rd] In order to meet actual needs, the Sichuan authorities have decided to plan to issue small-denomination local circulation certificates.

### Secretary of State Acheson Issues Statement: US Refuses to Negotiate Separately with the Soviets, Accuses Stalin of Manipulating International Politics; If the Soviets are Sincere, They Can Follow Normal Channels for Resolution

[United Press International, Washington, 2nd] Secretary of State Acheson accused Premier Stalin of using the suggestion to meet with President Truman and sign a non-aggression pact to manipulate international politics with peace. Acheson stated that the world's interest in peace is fundamental, and this matter cannot be falsified, nor can it be a tool for any international political means. The United States will not use peace in such a way. Previously, the White House stated that President Truman had not received a formal telegram from Stalin, but Truman still maintained his original stance, saying that he was prepared and willing to meet with Stalin in Washington. Acheson stated in a one-hour press conference that if Stalin truly wished to discuss peace with Truman, he could proceed through official channels, without going through the press. Acheson's statement is the first official US response to Stalin's proposal. Acheson pointed out the following points: First, all normal diplomatic channels between the United States and the Soviet Union remain open, and this matter can be handled through these channels. Second, he believes that it would be unhelpful for the US President to travel halfway around the world for the fourth time to meet with Stalin to discuss intangible issues. Third, the United States is unwilling to negotiate separately with any country on any matter involving the interests of other countries, unless these countries are also invited to participate. Fourth, Acheson lamented that the Soviet Union often took obstructive actions in the United Nations in reaching agreements on atomic energy control, world disarmament, and the establishment of an international police force. Fifth, Acheson declared that the Soviet Union's use of the veto in United Nations conferences has undermined the purpose of the United Nations Charter in peacefully resolving various disputes. Sixth, Stalin had carefully expressed his willingness to conclude a US-Soviet peace treaty, which Acheson has rejected. Acheson declared that when the United States and the Soviet Union signed the United Nations Charter, they had already mutually agreed never to engage in war. Seventh, Acheson reiterated Truman's claim during his inauguration that the United States consistently upholds the United Nations. Acheson stated that Truman "was not saying that he was prepared to consider making this claim, but he has already stated this claim clearly."

### US Government Clarifies Firm Stance: Doubts of Western European Countries Fully Dispelled; Hope to Complete the Atlantic Pact Soon

[United Press International, London, 3rd] After the United States reassured that there would be no Stalin-Truman meeting to end the Cold War, Western European countries were relieved. While feeling bewildered by Stalin's statement of willingness to talk peace with Truman, Western figures were very suspicious of the Soviet Union's "spring peace offensive" and any private negotiations arising from it. Secretary of State Acheson's outright rejection of Stalin's proposal cleared away all existing worries. British officials, among others, were most outspoken, denouncing Stalin's proposal as pure propaganda. Prime Minister Attlee plans to tell questioners in Parliament on the 3rd that he rejects all suggestions to have Britain facilitate a Truman-Stalin meeting.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 2nd] French Premier Queuille said today at a banquet for British and American journalists that if Truman and Stalin were willing to meet on French territory, France would welcome it. Queuille stated that Stalin should now clearly declare his true intentions, and if the purpose of the talks is to lay the foundation for world peace, then we are willing to unanimously agree and welcome reaching an understanding. France is willing to work with other relevant major powers to eliminate the threat of war, provided that both sides can express equal sincerity.

[United Press International, London, 2nd] Stalin's "paper talks" with the United States have spurred Western European countries to speed up the completion of the Atlantic Security Pact. It is generally believed that completing the pact as soon as possible will strengthen the West's power to resist this pressure. The Western reaction has generally been skeptical, but there is also an underlying hope that the leaders of the world's two largest countries might agree to a truce in the "Cold War"? Western figures here explain that the influence of the Atlantic bloc, backed by potentially $2 billion worth of US equipment, is clearly far beyond any diplomatic and political measures related to the "Cold War." If the pact is completed, it can give Truman the support of a strong Atlantic alliance. In any potential talks with Stalin, he will have more room for bargaining.

### Soviet Communist Party Accuses Britain and the United States of Inciting a New War

[United Press International, Moscow, 3rd] Soviet Communist Party Secretary Pospelov stated at the party's conference on the 3rd that the British and American ruling classes are attempting to establish world domination by force. He stated, "They have entered an aggressive stage of launching a new war. These countries are breaking their agreements. The instigators of Anglo-American aggressive policies do not need agreements for cooperation with the Soviet Union, only empty talk of agreements and cooperation. They are worried that cooperation and agreements with the Soviet Union will dispel their aggressive warmongering policies." He continued, "The war preparations of the ruling classes of American imperialism and European capitalist countries are becoming increasingly open."

### Soviet Newspapers Compete to Publish Stalin's Statement

Said to be Like Dropping a Bomb on Britain and the United States

[Associated Press, Moscow, 3rd] Soviet newspapers and radio stations today published Stalin's second statement from yesterday, but did not mention Secretary of State Acheson's response. The newspapers also competed to publish foreign reactions to Stalin's first statement. One telegram stated that Stalin's talk completely disrupted the imperialist ranks. Another telegram stated that Stalin's talk dropped a bomb within the ranks of warmongers, making them embarrassed and overwhelmed.

### Churchill Calls for Western European Unity

Hopes for Early Establishment of a European Council

[This Newspaper's Report] London, 3rd broadcast: After receiving the Dutch Peace Gold Medal, Churchill delivered a speech at a gathering of international community diplomatic leaders and members of parliament, calling for the promotion of a European parliament "to make the concept of European unity a reality.

### US Considering Publicly Releasing the Existing Number of Atomic Bombs

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd, United Press International] US Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Lilienthal agreed today to consider releasing the number of atomic bombs the United States currently possesses to the world. Lilienthal made these remarks during a debate in the Congressional Atomic Energy Committee. Lilienthal stated that the United States' atomic weapons have indeed greatly improved, but this does not mean that the current atomic bombs are thousands of times more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped on Japan in the past.

### US Naval Authorities Shift Their Focus: Emphasis on the Atlantic Fleet; Building New Ships to Replace Old Ones

[This Newspaper's Report] Washington, 3rd broadcast: US Navy Secretary Sullivan told the Congressional Military Committee and Appropriations Committee today that in order to adapt to next year's budget, the Navy must immediately make major reductions. Nine locations, including the Philippine Islands, Okinawa, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Pearl Harbor, and several air stations scattered within the country, must cease operations, and 72 warships must also be retired. However, because new ships are being built, the actual number of reductions will be 24. Most of the weakened parts are mostly on the West Coast or in the Pacific region. The US Navy has shifted its focus from emphasizing the Pacific fleet to emphasizing the Atlantic Fleet, which provides further proof.

### South Korean Defense Forces Stationed on the Demarcation Line

[Central News Agency, Cheongdam, Korea, 2nd, United Press International] One thousand Soviet-trained North Korean troops recently invaded the US-occupied area of South Korea. Senior Korean political figures said today that the above military action may be the start of a civil war between North and South Korea. The 1,000 troops currently invading the US-occupied area southward have 2,000 reserve troops, but the latter are still stationed north of the 38th parallel. They also stated: This military action is definitely not the nature of a guerrilla raid and will inevitably be the start of a civil war between North and South, and it is also an international conflict. It is also reported that the invading troops are currently 300 to 400 yards across the border. They are well-trained and possess Soviet equipment such as rifles, mortars, and field guns.

[Associated Press, Seoul, 3rd] One hundred and fifty North Korean armed personnel attacked Bak Hong-jin, a South Korean border town, at dawn today, setting fires and killing at least seven police officers and civilians.

### Netherlands Disregards UN Agencies, Willing to Negotiate Directly with Indonesia; Conciliation Committee Urges Netherlands to Express Its Attitude Quickly

[Associated Press, The Hague, 2nd] A Dutch government spokesperson said today that the Netherlands is willing to negotiate directly with the Indonesian people to resolve the Indonesian issue and is unwilling to go through UN agencies. It is heard that the Netherlands intends to establish the Indonesian Federation immediately and no longer insists on establishing a provisional government as a transition. At the same time, Thompoh, the representative of the Republic of Indonesia at Lake Success, said that if the Netherlands does not negotiate with the Republic of Indonesia and establishes the Indonesian Federation without authorization, it is tantamount to disregarding the UN Security Council resolution.

[Associated Press, Batavia, 2nd] The UN Conciliation Committee sent a letter to the Dutch delegation today, questioning whether the Dutch government has the sincerity to implement the Security Council's resolution of January 28 and asking for a quick response.

### Temporary Suspension of Free Trading of Rice; Limited Purchase of One Dou Per Person with Certificate; Mayor Wu Decides on Emergency Measures to Stabilize Grain Prices; Price Per Dan Not to Exceed 4,800

[This Newspaper's Report] After the Lunar New Year holiday, the price of rice has been soaring wildly in recent days. The municipal government, considering that the price of rice directly affects general prices, has decided to use high-pressure means to suppress this unreasonable phenomenon. Mayor Wu convened representatives of rice merchants in the city at the municipal government conference room at 5 pm yesterday to discuss emergency measures to suppress rice prices. The following measures were agreed upon jointly: Starting today, the Ministry of Food will allocate 5,000 dan of white japonica rice daily to supply to the city. At the same time, each rice merchant is required to be responsible for supplying 5,000 zu (white japonica) to the market daily. Citizens can use the purchase certificates No. 5 and No. 6 attached to their national identity cards to buy rice from rice stores. Each certificate is limited to buying five sheng, totaling one dou, calculated as 15 jin. The wholesale price per dan is 4,500 yuan, and the retail price is stipulated not to exceed 4,800 yuan. Starting today (the 4th), citizens can use purchase certificate No. 6 to buy five sheng of rice sold by rice merchants from rice stores. Purchase certificate No. 5 will only be allowed to be purchased starting tomorrow (the 5th).

Mayor Wu said when he met with reporters at 6 pm yesterday: Free trading of rice will be completely suspended from today. He has ordered that all rice transactions in the market yesterday will be invalidated and will only be allowed to resume trading after the rice price falls back to a reasonable price.

According to Wu, the rice demand of the city's citizens is two dou per person per month. The household rice has supplied one dou, and now they can buy one dou with a purchase certificate. He believes that the people's food this month is no longer a concern, and the rice price will definitely return to normal.

Also, in order to maintain the rice source, Mayor Wu telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Tang yesterday, asking him to instruct the garrisons in Wuxi, Changshu, Jiaxing, Jiashan, and Fengjing to not requisition or block rice boats transporting rice to Shanghai.

### This Month's Household Rice: Sale Price to be Announced Tomorrow

The distribution of this month's household rice in the city is being actively prepared by the Civil Affairs Committee and is scheduled to begin on the 6th.

A reporter from the East China News Agency learned from the person in charge of the Civil Affairs Committee yesterday that the rice distribution method for this month's household rice is to adapt to the principle of adjusting the distribution price at any time. The rice distribution certificate is divided into three parts, and new methods for its use will be determined separately and will be officially announced tomorrow.

Also, it is reported: It is learned that the authorities have decided to modify the key rice distribution method for workers and their families in this city in February, that is, the original rice distribution certificate of 15 jin per sheet is now divided into three purchases, each time five jin. The certificate is a triplicate form. Each time a purchase is made, one sheet is cut off. This certificate is being printed overnight and is expected to be issued today.

### Mayor's Hand-Written Order: Strictly Prohibit Black Market in Gold and Banknotes

### Domestic Coal Sources Cut Off; Relying Only on Foreign Coal to Maintain; Fuel Panic Becomes More Severe

According to the Joint Office of the Kailuan, East China, Huainan, and Taiwan Coal Mines: Amid the coal shortage, the lack of fuel coal this month will be even more severe. The main reason is still that the source of coal cannot be increased. The Kailuan, East China, and Huainan coal mines, which are domestic coal sources, have all fallen into war zones, and only the Hebei Coal Mine has a slight amount of fuel coal coming in. In January of this year, only 30,000 tons of Taiwanese coal were shipped, and at most, only 30,000 tons can be shipped this month. In addition to domestic coal, foreign coal is the main source. The coal used by various public utilities in the city last month was entirely maintained by foreign coal imports. Only 30,000 tons of Soviet coal can be shipped in this month, and 5,000 tons of American coal can be shipped. There is no other source. The total amount of coal sources this month is only 65,000 tons, while the most essential demand in this city this month is more than 100,000 tons, which is still short by about 30,000 tons. The Coal Ash Association and the relevant departments are currently gathering for this.

### Middle School Principals Discuss Tuition Issues: High School 1.5 Shi, Junior High School 1.2 Shi; Principle Decided to Collect Fees Once; School Opening Date Determined by Each School

[This Newspaper's Report] Regarding the issue of tuition fees for public and private primary and secondary schools in the city, the Education Bureau previously sent a letter to the Municipal Council asking it to select a date to convene councilors and education figures, representatives of principals and teachers from public and private schools, etc., to discuss together. Now that the school opening is approaching, a meeting will be held soon.

Yesterday afternoon, the principals of municipal middle schools held a symposium at the Pudong Native Place Association. Director Li of the Education Bureau also attended. Regarding the issue of fees, the principals decided to submit the resolution standard of the previous principals' meeting, that is, 1.5 shi for high school and 1.2 shi for junior high school, to the authorities for final approval. In principle, it was decided to collect fees once, but if each school has difficulties, it can be collected in installments. The school opening date was originally set for February 5, but now that various municipal middle schools in the suburbs have garrisons stationed there, each school will decide according to the situation. Director Li of the Education Bureau will visit Garrison Commander Chen Daqing today to urge the withdrawal of troops from the school in order to avoid affecting classes.

Municipal School Teachers Request: Treatment the Same as Private Schools

Regarding the issue of the treatment of municipal school teachers, the representatives of municipal middle school teachers requested the same treatment as private school teachers. According to Yuan Zhe, the principal of Yucai Middle School, a municipal school, the treatment of teachers in private schools is, if high school tuition is calculated at 3 shi of rice, the monthly income of teachers should be over 30,000 yuan, while the treatment of municipal middle school teachers is only about 2,000 yuan. Therefore, the morale of municipal school teachers has been shaken, and many tend to transfer to private schools to teach. Therefore, how to achieve a balance between the treatment of private and municipal school teachers is a major issue.

The Municipal Middle School Faculty and Staff Association suggested that the tuition standard for the next semester, in addition to school administrative expenses, should be 1.5 shi of rice for each high school student and 1.25 shi for each junior high school student for academic development fees.

### Whether or Not the Export-Import Management Committee Moves South Depends on the Actions of the National Bank

Regarding the rumors that the Export-Import Management Committee has begun to move south to Guangzhou, the person in charge of the committee said yesterday that so far, the committee is still in preparation. Because the committee's business is closely related to the Central Bank, it is difficult for the committee to move south on its own before the Central Bank moves south. Therefore, whether or not the committee moves depends on whether or not the Central Bank moves. As for the committee's Shanghai office, all work is still proceeding as usual and has not been interrupted.

### Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Passenger Trains Temporarily Suspended Yesterday, Partial Resumption Expected Today

[Taibao News] Passenger transport on both lines is becoming increasingly difficult. All passenger trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line were suspended yesterday afternoon. In the morning, only three trains departed. On the Shanghai-Nanjing line, only four trains departed in the morning. The situation was better in the afternoon. Commuter trains in the Wuxi-Changzhou area continued to operate. A resumption of Shanghai-Hangzhou railway passenger services is expected today. It is reported that the reasons for the significant reduction in passenger train services yesterday and the suspension of the Shanghai-Hangzhou line in the afternoon were: (1) Shortage of train cars; (2) Congestion due to military transport trains, roads in need of urgent repairs; (3) The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway can no longer accommodate refugees and vehicles moving south, requesting the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to reduce southbound trains to a minimum. It is reported that starting today, Shanghai-Hangzhou passenger trains are expected to partially resume. This situation is a normal occurrence when there are too many vehicles on the railway and the train schedules are overly chaotic, which is expected to be difficult to avoid in the future. However, this is by no means a railway interruption or suspension of passenger transport. The new director, Wang Zhaohuai, has guaranteed that he will do his best to maintain passenger transport and will not allow it to be interrupted or suspended.

[Another Report] Due to the reduction in passenger trains, revenue on both lines has plummeted. Yesterday, Shanghai Station only collected over 200,000 in ticket revenue, which was barely enough to pay for coal. Shanghai Station's revenue accounts for half of the entire revenue of both lines. As a result, the economies of both lines have fallen into extremely difficult situations.

Afterward, under the joint persuasion of Team Leader Yan of the West District Disciplinary Team of the Garrison Command and Chief Song of the Lujiawan Police Station, the employees resumed work at 4:30 PM, and buses gradually left the depot and resumed operation.

Mayor Wu and Commander Chen have scheduled a meeting with the heads of various garrisoned units today to discuss how to improve relations between the military and civilians and ensure the safety of employees of public transportation services.

### Maintaining Traffic Order on Both Railway Lines, Military Law Enforcement Patrol Formed

Team Leader Mao Sen Arrives in Shanghai to Organize

In light of the recent proximity of the war zone and the frequent movement of troops passing through the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, the Shanghai-Nanjing Garrison Command has noted that it is easy for undisciplined soldiers and illegal elements to mix in, arbitrarily causing disturbances. There have been frequent incidents of soldiers interfering with train operations and beating railway staff, causing the traffic order on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines to become increasingly chaotic, which seriously affects traffic safety and damages military discipline. Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo and Director Wang Zhaohuai of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Administration have discussed the matter and decided that, in addition to strengthening the military police escorting trains starting immediately, a military law enforcement patrol will be formed, led by Mao Sen, Director of the Second Division of the Command, to regularly dispatch personnel to rectify traffic order on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines and the military discipline of soldiers from various units. Mr. Mao arrived in Shanghai yesterday and is actively consulting with the two railway administrations on organizational matters. It is expected that the patrol will be formally established and deployed to carry out its mission within days. After the team is established, it will, in accordance with the emergency military laws promulgated by the Ministry of National Defense, execute on the spot without leniency any unlawful soldiers who interfere with the duties of stationmasters, disrupt traffic order, detain locomotives, or use military vehicles to transport private goods, in order to ensure the safety of traffic on both railway lines.

[Our Own Report] No. 26, Lane 483, Madang Road, is the residence of Cui Xichen, a police officer No. 4552 of the Lujiawan Police Station. At around 7:00 PM the night before last, Cui was out, when several robbers broke in, pulled out firearms, and threatened his family members.

### Vast Ocean, Where to Summon Souls, Exploring the Sunken Ship's Victims, Hai Chuan Continues Search

[Our Own Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Chuan, carrying the families of the victims of the sunken Taiping Steamer, set off for the waters off Baijie Mountain at noon on the 31st of last month to explore. The ship arrived near Maji Mountain at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 1st and anchored. Representatives of the victims' families landed to explore, but found nothing.

### Safe Deposit Box Business at Various Banks Gradually Improving

According to the Custody Division of the Trust Department of the Bank of China, the establishment of safe deposit boxes is the most important security guarantee for banking business, and its value is even more important during turbulent times.

Currently, the banks with safe deposit boxes are: Bank of China on the Bund with 12,000 boxes (93 percent rented), Bank of China in Hongkou with 2,000 boxes, Bank of China branch in Jing'an Temple with 2,000 boxes, Four Banks Trust Department with 5,000 boxes, and Shanghai Bank with 6,000 boxes. The above are larger in scale.

From January of last year until before the price freeze, speculative trading in gold, banknotes on the black market, and stocks used bank safe deposit boxes to evade inspection by the authorities, resulting in an extremely abnormal prosperity in the business. Since the price freeze, it has returned to a normal state.

The Bank of China (Bund) safe deposit box is the largest and most solid in the Far East. The Philippine National Bank safe deposit box in Pearl Harbor was destroyed before the war. The Bank of China's equipment has 12,000 safe deposit boxes. The construction cost (300,000 US dollars in 1937) was high. The entire vault is located on the lower ground floor. The destructive power of the latest weapon, the atomic bomb, can incinerate buildings, but cannot damage a vault located on the lower ground floor with no air supply for the uranium inside the atomic bomb to explode, and with several layers of steel plates. This point is unique to our country among the new storage facilities in the banking industry of various countries, and it can also be called a glorious place.

### Teacher's Rape of Female Student Case: Principal and Others Indicted, Trial Concluded

[Report from Our Newspaper] Shen Qier, a teacher at the Liuyun Elementary School on Fusantang Street in this city and a disgrace to the teaching profession, was charged with raping a female student surnamed Dai. Judge Cao Zuwei of the District Court continued the trial yesterday morning. The defendant is at large. Tong Muge, the school principal, and Chen Shanchang, the director of administration, were summoned to court as the other two defendants. Dai Yunsu, the mother of the victimized student, brought her daughter to the court and tearfully recounted the ordeal, along with a civil suit demanding 710,000 yuan in compensation from the defendants. Tong Muge claimed complete ignorance of the principal offender's bestial conduct and expressed a willingness, out of moral obligation, to find Shen and bring him to justice, as Shen is currently at large. After closing arguments by both parties' lawyers, the court announced that a verdict would be delivered on the morning of the tenth of this month. It is reported that in this case, the principal offender, Shen Qier, was advised by Tong and Chen for several days after the incident to dissuade Dai's mother from reporting to the police, and they attempted mediation, during which Shen fled without a trace. The prosecutor, considering Tong and Chen difficult to exonerate, indicted them as well.

### Six District Cotton Textile Trade Associations Plead: Waive Restrictions on Southern Transport of Yarn and Cloth; Minister of Industry and Commerce Agrees to Consider

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the newspaper reported that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce would reinstate restrictions on the southern transport of yarn and cloth in order to suppress market prices, the Six District Cotton Textile Trade Associations believe that the soaring prices of various commodities since the reopening of business after the Spring Festival are primarily due to financial factors and the increase in general production costs. The past implementation of restrictions or the suspension of southern transport of yarn and cloth not only failed to suppress market prices but also caused panic among the people of South China regarding clothing. Furthermore, the sales area for yarn and cloth in Shanghai has been shrinking recently. Restricting the only remaining market in South China would choke off the vitality of factories and leave over 200,000 cotton textile workers on the brink of destitution, with profound and significant consequences. It is reported that the standing directors of the association, along with Secretary-General Wang Zhuyi and others, paid a visit to Minister Liu of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday morning to personally present the actual difficulties faced by the cotton textile industry. They requested that the restrictions on the southern transport of yarn and cloth be waived to ensure the well-being of the people and alleviate business difficulties. Minister Liu reportedly indicated that the southern transport of yarn and cloth would be temporarily registered, and that the request to completely waive restrictions would be considered.

### Discount and Loan Meeting Held Yesterday

### Relaxed Monetary Conditions Unabated: Large-Scale Return of Cash

Yesterday, monetary conditions in the city remained relaxed and unabated. The main reason is that financial authorities were unable to contract the money supply. It is said that after the situation in North China changed, a large amount of gold yuan flowed south, further exacerbating the currency glut in the city. Although market demand is sluggish, the supply is even more abundant, and the practice of short-term borrowing has reappeared. The overnight interest rate is around 30 yuan, with rates as low as 25 yuan available, even below the interest rates owed by banks and firms. It is widely believed that the future trend of monetary conditions is uncontrollable and the prospects for prices are worrisome.

Cash was unusually abundant yesterday, with banks and firms no longer having withdrawal limits. However, the cash being paid out was all old banknotes tied with rope, indicating the recent return of currency. Promissory notes have decreased significantly in recent days, and discounts have disappeared.

### Foreign Exchange Certificates Surge: Overseas Remittances Up Another 100 Yuan

The market for foreign exchange transfer certificates (on the 3rd) saw another surge in prices. Opening in the morning, it immediately set a new record of 500 yuan, then continued to rise. Exporters were waiting for higher prices and unwilling to sell, resulting in a closing price of 620 yuan. The exchange rate for overseas remittances was also adjusted to 500 yuan on the 3rd, an increase of 100 yuan.

(5) The CCP may adopt considerable "hypocritical gestures" at the beginning of controlling newspapers and restricting personal freedom to win over or prevent free people and intellectuals from becoming alienated, and to prevent opposition from democratic forces abroad.

(6) All government ministries and agencies will be reorganized starting from the highest level, but many low-level Kuomintang officials will remain in their posts because the CCP lacks administrative and technical personnel.

(7) Improving transportation and the domestic economy. During the civil war, the Communist army destroyed railways and blockaded waterways. After the war ends, these will be gradually restored, and domestic trade will also gradually recover.

The speed and extent of these changes will depend on the following two factors:

(1) Whether President Chiang or any Kuomintang leaders attempt to continue resistance against the CCP in China or in the form of a foreign government in exile.

(2) The consequences of the competition between the United States and the Soviet Union to continue influencing China.

### Barter Trade with the Sterling Bloc: CITC Drafting Measures

All members of the association are hereby notified that in addition to those who intend to participate in person, exporters who wish to contact exhibiting manufacturers in France can do so directly by mail.

### China Textile Corporation Cotton Yarn Not Yet Dumped: High Prices for Yarn and Cloth Emerge Repeatedly

The China Textile Corporation distributed a large quantity of goods yesterday, totaling 22,300 bolts of cloth and 110,000 pounds of yarn, for a total of 140,681,000 gold yuan. There were eighteen types of cloth available. The assessed prices were: Dragon Head Fine Cloth 6,000 yuan, Special B 11-pound Fine Twill 5,500 yuan, Deputy Brand 29 1/2G Serge Gray 5,000 yuan, Four Gentlemen Serge 6,500 yuan, Four Gentlemen Yuangong Ni 6,800 yuan, Gentleman B 42G Bleached Cloth 6,000 yuan, Four Gentlemen 9029 Printed Serge 6,200 yuan, Four Gentlemen 9034 and 9035 6,200 yuan, Second-Grade Printed Serge 5,400 yuan, Second-Grade Printed Straight Gong 5,400 yuan, Second-Grade Printed Xiaosha 4,600 yuan, Second-Grade Printed Cloth 4,300 yuan, Hongguang Fine Yuangong Satin 5,800 yuan, Jumping Carp Yuanguang 4,000 yuan, Three Beauties 1017, 1110, 1113 Flower Poplin 5,000 yuan. As for cotton yarn, none was dumped yesterday.

Also, market conditions for cotton yarn rose sharply yesterday. Authorities temporarily suspended yarn dumping, boosting confidence. Surplus capital from within and outside the industry flooded the market, driving prices to new heights. 42-count Blue Phoenix opened at a high of 240,000 yuan in the morning. The market was very active, and prices continued to rise, reaching a new price of 300,000 yuan. It fell slightly near the close, ending at 290,000 yuan, up 80,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse initially traded at 175,000 yuan. It was sold off at high prices mid-session, and the rising trend fluctuated. By the close, it was still pushing toward a new high, closing at 180,000 yuan, also up 50,000 yuan.

The rising trend for cotton cloth remained very strong. After the restrictions on southern transport, it was reported that customs could still ship it out, so Guangdong merchants were vigorously searching for it, with retail investors following suit, and new highs emerged repeatedly. Four Gentlemen Yuangong Serge opened in the morning, exceeding the 5,000 yuan mark, opening at 5,200 yuan. The market was filled with buying interest, and it rose again and again. By 10:45, it reached a new high of 6,650 yuan. It fell slightly near the close, ending at 6,500 yuan at the noon close, up 1,750 yuan from the previous day's close. Leifeng Pagoda Yuangong Serge traded at 6,200 yuan. Mid-range fine cloths hovered around 5,600 yuan. Colored cloth continued to rise, with Dragon Head Fine Cloth quoted at 7,000 yuan off-market, up 2,000 yuan. Industry insiders frequently sold at high prices. Although the asking price was high near the close, trading became sparse.

### Silk Continues to Rise

Yesterday, the market conditions for rayon continued to rise, with relaxed capital within the industry, rising prices for all commodities outside the industry, and heightened sentiment, leading to soaring prices. When the Tianqiao 120 opened, it was reported that foreign exchange certificates were rising sharply and the black market for gold notes remained strong. The market was quite brisk, with a high price of 200,000 yuan quoted. New buyers emerged immediately. Seeing that the fundamentals were still strong, dealers repeatedly raised their prices, and the buying interest remained strong. The market continued to rise, reaching a high of 240,000 yuan by noon, a sharp increase of 80,000 yuan. The market heard that gold prices were also good, and the momentum continued to strengthen. However, asking prices varied, and trading was not very active.

The market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates for raw silk continued to rise. Confidence within the industry was optimistic. Moreover, with the simultaneous rise of all commodities outside the industry, the market followed suit. High-grade Another Load was quoted at 240,000 yuan in the morning, with supply available. Then, it was reported that rayon was rising sharply and yarn and cloth were soaring, and sentiment became strong again. The market improved, and trading prices rose another 20,000 yuan. At the noon close, ordinary Another Load was 235,000 yuan. No trading was reported for other grades.

The silk and satin market yesterday saw a surge in prices for raw silk and rayon and a general rise in commodity prices outside the circle, which caused a strong buying spree in the market and a firm mood among investors. The high opening price for Meiya quilt covers in the morning was 135,000 yuan. After jobbers offered high prices, the market fell into consolidation, but because of the easy money policy, it was difficult to stop the upward trend, and quotes jumped to 140,000. In the afternoon, however, the appetite faded a little, and the market closed at 142,000 yuan.

### Taiwan Sugar Soars

Sugar prices had previously been down on news of Taiwan Sugar distributions and the announcement that the authorities would dump stocks on the market. The price was therefore uninspired. Yesterday, however, prices outside the circle were up, and there was a general slackening of money supply within the industry, which boosted demand. The price of Number 45 White Refined sugar opened strong at 95,000 yuan in the morning, then jumped to 100,000 yuan, and finally closed at 103,000, for a surge of 19,000 yuan. All other grades were up by at least twenty percent.

### Loose Monetary Policy: Grain and Rice Prices Soar in Unison

The rice market continues to be extremely strong due to the high prices of silver dollars and gold, and general market sentiment is extremely agitated. Further, with the prices of almost all goods outside of the rice market rising, blocked transport, and very limited arrivals, rice merchants are doing all they can to raise prices. The opening increases were modest, with rice prices rising by five or six hundred yuan. Later, however, prices rose sharply, in part because money supply is unrestrictive and rice shops report healthy demand amid limited supply. This morning there were a few samples offered for sale, but in the afternoon, there were very few samples on offer and prices were fluctuating wildly. White keng rice in the northern market rose to 5,800 yuan, a sharp increase of 1,400 yuan. Early thin rice crops rose by more than 30 percent across the board. White keng thin rice in the southern market was traded at 5,500 yuan, up 1,300 yuan. Prices continued to rise after the close. Thin rice was last quoted at 6,000 yuan. The two markets together saw arrivals of 4,014 piculs.

The rising trend for flour has started fiercely and the atmosphere is strong and exuberant. In the first part of the morning, the price of flour immediately crossed the 11,000 yuan threshold. Flour traders in the central market took advantage of the high prices to dump their goods. Demand consequently slackened somewhat and prices receded briefly to the 2,000 yuan level. However, after the break, individual traders started snapping it up, and the market rallied again. At close, it changed hands at 2,150 yuan. Old-stock flour sold for as much as 2,260 yuan. Other brands of flour all rose by over fifty percent. Wheat bran followed, rising by over thirty percent, and Fuxin flour closed at 1,495 yuan.

The rally in the price of coarse grains widened. Arrivals of soybeans have been turning scarcer. This is producing a serious shortage on the market, and traders are taking advantage of this opportunity to raise prices. The price of Hankou bean suddenly rose again to over twice its previous price, and today changed hands at 4,000 yuan. Oil plants snapped up the beans, pushing the price through the 4,000 yuan level. Guangdong traders made every effort to acquire groundnuts. Traders in Yangzhou urgently asked for a price of 10,000 yuan, and at close of trade, a price of 9,500 was agreed. The price of sesame was underpinned and was snapped up on the local market; prices were up by an average of more than eighty percent.

The rise in the price of edible oils was intense. Prices have been rising across the board because of the ease with which money can be borrowed and an excited mood among the public. Traders are strenuously raising prices, and the market is short of supply. Few vendors are to be seen, but loud calls from buyers can be heard all around. Only after quite a while, was a first deal done. The prices of soybean oil and unrefined oil rose the most steeply because of the scarcity of stockpiles and arrivals. Oil from mills opened this morning at 27,000, and ended at 29,000, for a steep rise of 11,000, equivalent to over sixty percent. A drum of unrefined oil was 32,000, and they shouted for higher prices but there were no vendors to be seen. Clean unrefined oil from mills was 34,000, up also by over sixty percent. Unrefined rapeseed oil closed at 34,000 yuan, up 8,000. Soybean cakes rose by fifty percent to over 2,000 yuan.
