### College Students in the Capital March and Petition; Clash with Military Officers Corps; No Fewer Than 160 People Injured on Both Sides, Five Critically Injured; Government Authorities Strictly Prevent Escalation of the Situation

[Our Nanjing Office, 1st] Thousands of students from eleven colleges in the capital held a large-scale march and demonstration movement today, amidst the start of peace talks by the peace delegation leaving Beijing for Beiping, resulting in a clash with military officers and causing mutual beatings. No fewer than 160 people were injured on both sides, and five were seriously injured and in critical condition. The situation is serious, and the Capital Garrison Headquarters has taken emergency measures to prevent escalation. From 10:00 PM tonight, a special curfew will be imposed early, and orders have been issued that from the 2nd, if any officers corps members take the initiative to go to any school and have any conflict with students, they will be shot on the spot. President of the Executive Yuan He Yingqin, in addition to expressing unlimited regret for this unfortunate incident, will investigate and hold those responsible accountable. It is reported that the security authorities had received reports in advance about the students' desire to hold a demonstration and march, so they tried to persuade them, but to no avail. By 10:00 AM on the 1st, 3,000 students from eleven colleges had gathered at Zhongda University, and then went to the Presidential Palace to petition, sending ten representatives to request an audience with Acting President Li, presenting several requests, including demanding full public funding, implementing the seven promises, striving for true peace, and opposing false peace. Secretary-General Weng Wenhao met with them on behalf of the President, expressing sympathy for the students' demands, promising to convey them, and saying that he would find ways to improve the treatment of all staff and workers. The students then left the Presidential Palace and marched through the city, using several trucks as propaganda vehicles, shouting slogans such as "Oppose hunger, oppose persecution," "Oppose American aid," "Oppose the issuance of large bills," "Oppose conscription," and "Oppose false peace," and performing Yangko dances to promote their cause to the public. They returned to Zhongda University to disband at 2:20 PM, and students from each school returned to their schools in separate groups. When the students were marching, near Dazhong Bridge, because the slogans they shouted were too stimulating, and they posted slogans to promote their cause to the military officers, a dispute occurred with several members of the military officers corps stationed nearby (all of whom were officers who had retreated from the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign). The military officers tore down the slogans posted by the students, and after the students disbanded, about 100 students from the Drama School returned to their school in a group, arriving at Dazhong Bridge, and a conflict and mutual beating occurred with about 300 military officers and soldiers. More than 60 students were arrested, and more than 10 were injured. Some students fled to NCCU for help, and hundreds of NCCU students gathered and went to rescue them, and they encountered the military officers corps again, and more than 10 people were injured again, including two seriously injured (one named Ding Yongping, and one a female student named Tian Wenhui). Zhongda University students were reported to have organized a team to go to the Presidential Palace to petition (it was already 6:00 PM), demanding punishment of the perpetrators and compensation for medical expenses. The military officers corps near Dazhong Bridge also heard the news and immediately forcibly occupied several trucks used by the Drama School for their parade, driving to the Presidential Palace, and a conflict occurred again with Zhongda University students. The security authorities, to prevent further incidents, imposed a curfew early at 10:00 PM, and the students were unable to move, so the number of casualties has not yet been ascertained, but it is known that most of the injured have been sent to the hospital, and it is rumored that 10 students are still missing. The students participating in the march today included 11 schools, including NCCU, Zhongda University, Jinling University, Ginling Women's University, the Drama School, Jianguo, the Law and Business School, and the Oriental Language School. Approximately 5,000 students.

Among the students injured in the conflict, those admitted to Gulou Hospital include 29 from NCCU, 21 from Zhongda University, 16 from Jianguo, and 1 from the Joint Logistics Headquarters. Five students, including Ding Yongping, Wu Deyi, Fang Bingxiang, Zuo Shijie, and Cheng Luze, were seriously injured and in critical condition. The number of deaths on both sides is still under investigation.

[Our Nanjing Office, 1st] The names of the officers corps members detained by the Garrison Headquarters are Li Peigen, Zhang Chengfang, Yang Ziqin, Deng Guochen, Liu Guangliang, and Ge Hansheng.

### Garrison Headquarters Spokesperson Talks About the Course of the Conflict

[Our Nanjing Office, 1st] Luo Chunbo, Director of the Political Work Department and spokesperson for the Capital Garrison Headquarters, received more than 30 Chinese and foreign reporters at the Headquarters at 9:00 PM on the 1st. First, Bao Jing'an, spokesperson for the Executive Yuan, reported that President He expressed great regret and attached great importance to the conflict between college students in the capital and the officers and soldiers of the Third Battalion of the military officers corps and had ordered the relevant authorities to investigate the responsibility and deal with it fairly. Director Luo then reported the course of the conflict in detail as follows: (1) Luo first said that the Garrison Headquarters received intelligence about the students' march yesterday afternoon and had advised all 11 colleges and universities in the capital not to hold it. After requesting instructions from the Presidential Palace and the Executive Yuan, instructions were received to persuade them, and if they did not listen, to allow them to march, but to protect them along the way and pay attention to maintaining order; (2) After receiving the instructions, the Headquarters ordered the police to step up their efforts to maintain public order. From 9:00 AM this morning, college students from various schools gathered at Sipailou, gradually increasing to 4,000 to 5,000 people. At 11:00 AM, led by the Drama School, the team set off, first to the Presidential Palace to petition, then along Guofu Road, along the main roads, to Baixia Road, distributing leaflets, posting slogans, shouting slogans, and the propaganda teams formed by various schools carried out individual propaganda to the crowds on the roadside, but until the parade disbanded at 2:00 PM, the order was orderly, and no accidents occurred; (3) Unexpectedly, at 2:00 PM, the Garrison Headquarters suddenly received a report from the South District Police Department that some students who had marched had gone to Daguang Road and Dazhong Bridge after disbanding, intending to carry out propaganda to the officers and soldiers of the Third Battalion of the military officers corps (according to the report, all the officers and soldiers of the battalion were officers and soldiers who had been captured by the Communist army during the war and later returned). The team refused to accept them, and the students posted slogans all over the team's gate and distributed leaflets at the same time. The members of the military officers corps then tore up the leaflets and slogans, so they went from verbal arguments to fighting. After the Garrison Headquarters received the report from the South District Police Department, it sent personnel to suppress and mediate, and sent dozens of injured people from both sides to the hospital for treatment, and the situation had calmed down. Unexpectedly, after the fighting occurred, some students went back to their schools to ask for help, and the number of people who reassembled reached more than 2,000. The military officers corps also increased their support in order not to show weakness, so retaliation began again, and the situation became more intense. The Headquarters then sent personnel to mediate again. At this time, after the conflict expanded, the students advocated going to the Presidential Palace to petition, and the military officers corps immediately followed, resulting in fighting again on Guofu Road. The situation was chaotic at the time, and officers of the Garrison Headquarters were also injured while suppressing the situation. At this point, the Commander-in-Chief had no choice but to order the special task force to participate in the suppression and strictly ordered the members of the military officers corps that if they did not listen again, they would be killed on the spot regardless. The Garrison Headquarters arrested a total of eight members of the military officers corps at that time. At 8:00 PM, the members of the military officers corps were gathered and returned to their teams, and the injured were sent to the hospital. The situation calmed down at this point; (4) According to the Garrison Headquarters' statistics, the first time there were six students seriously injured and 66 lightly injured, a total of 72 people, at the Daguang New Village headquarters of the military officers corps on Daguang Road. The second time there were five seriously injured and 24 lightly injured, a total of 29 people. On the military officers corps side, there were 48 lightly injured in the first time, and five seriously injured and in the second time. In total, there were 11 students seriously injured, 101 lightly injured, a total of 112 people, and 40 members of the military officers corps. The total number of people on both sides was 160; (5) After the incident, the Garrison Headquarters has sent the injured to Gulou Central Hospital. After bandaging and changing the medicine for those with minor injuries, they were escorted back to their schools. Therefore, from beginning to end, except for the seven members of the military officers corps who are still detained at the Headquarters (another suspect, Gesang Quepei (Tibetan)), the Garrison Headquarters has never arrested any students; (6) In short, the conflict between the students and the officers corps was a purely accidental event. The military officers corps did not know in advance that the students wanted to carry out propaganda, and the students did not notify the team in advance that they wanted to carry out propaganda, which led to the conflict due to differences in the way both sides viewed things and temporary emotional agitation. The Department will conduct a thorough investigation of this case in many aspects and request the higher authorities to handle it. At the end of Director Luo's report, the seven members of the military officers corps detained by the Department, including Zhang Chengfang and Li Peigen, also reported the course of the conflict in great detail.

### Du Yuming Dies of Hunger Strike; Wang Yaowu Is Imprisoned in Jidong; A Conversation with an Officer Who Escaped from a POW Camp

### Smiling Faces, Heavy Hearts: Scenes of the Peace Delegation Leaving Nanjing; Many Relatives and Friends Entrust Them to Carry US Dollars and Silver Dollars

The peace delegation finally left on this day of Western proverbs' lies (April 1st), not lying. In addition to officials, the most people who came to the airport to see them off were people's representatives and members of the Legislative Yuan.

The earliest and most eye-catching of the delegation members was the veteran peace elder Shao Lizi. Wherever he went, people surrounded him, with laughter and crowding. Elder Yu Youren walked back and forth to find him. Mrs. Shao wanted him not to walk, but he said, "What does it matter? Let them take a walk," and everyone burst into laughter.

Newspaper reporters surrounded Elder Shao, and he tried to keep walking non-stop. When asked to sit down, he refused. So this encirclement became a guerrilla team, swimming back and forth. Some people said, "This is the younger generation surrounding the older generation," because Elder Shao is a veteran reporter.

The list of people leaving with the delegation was always kept secret, and newspaper reporters were unable to interview them everywhere, so they had to seek it from the list of people weighing in. As a result, they predicted the future, only using numbers instead, so reporters had to guess based on weight, such as 54 kilograms, which might be Zhang Shizhao, 65 kilograms, which might be Zhang Zhizhong, etc.

As soon as Zhang Qun arrived at the airport, he asked Zhang Zhizhong, "Where is Mr. Shao? Where is Mr. Shao?" When they found him, the two Zhangs and one Shao said in succession, "We have private words, we have private words," escaping the reporters' encirclement to open a "three-person meeting."

Elder Shao is a man with a smiling face and a heavy heart. After talking with Zhang Qun for a while today, when shaking hands to say goodbye, Elder Shao said, "I won't be too pessimistic, don't worry." Zhang Qun said two more words, "Military," and Elder Shao nodded again to indicate that he "knew." This heaviness lasted until Zhang Qun lowered his head after the plane took off.

Many relatives and friends asked the delegation to carry US dollars and silver dollars. Legislative Yuan member Wu Zhaoxu temporarily wrapped ten silver dollars in a small piece of torn newspaper and handed them to Li Junlong to give to Mrs. Wu. Li Lishi said, "Truly a standard husband."

It is said that Mrs. Zhang Zhizhong treats her husband with ancient etiquette and is rarely seen in public. Today, she also carried a glass handbag to the airport to see him off, which attracted much attention.

Before Elder Shao boarded the plane, he shook hands with his wife to say goodbye. Because of the crowded people, they were separated, and Elder Shao shouted loudly, "Goodbye!" His wife said, "I can't even hold your hand," as if she couldn't help but feel sad.

When the door of the special plane was already closed, He Yingqin still stood there with a focused expression. Someone asked He what he thought, and he said, "I hope they succeed!" The plane finally took off, and the huge roar and wind caused by the engines also passed, leaving behind a piece of calm.

### Amidst the Sound of Peace Talks, the Communist Army Expands Its Attack; The Flames of War Spread to the Southern Section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway; Artillery Fire Heard in Xinyang, Huayuan Attacked Fiercely and Fierce Fighting Breaks Out; Anqing in Crisis, the Defending Army Engaged in Bitter Fighting

[Our Hankou Office, 1st] The flames of war have approached Xinyang, and the situation is becoming increasingly tense. This morning at around 8:00 AM, residents of Beiguan heard a rumbling of artillery fire, which lasted for about a quarter of an hour.

Merchants and civilians inside and outside the city are fleeing south one after another. The Railway Bureau has added a passenger train to evacuate people, and the tragic scene of fleeing during the Spring Festival has reappeared at the station, from Datong Road to inside the city. At 10:00 PM on the 1st, telecommunications between Hankou and Xinyang were interrupted. It is reported that this is due to obstacles on the Beijing-Hankou line north of Huayuan.

Editorial

### The Peace Talks Have Begun

The government's peace negotiation delegation, a group of six led by "Peace General" Zhang Zhizhong, flew from Nanjing to Beiping yesterday morning amidst the bright spring sunshine to begin negotiations with the CCP delegation. The progress of these peace talks is not only about reconciliation and mending fences between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party but also concerns the entire nation's destiny and the people's livelihood. Especially for the people throughout the country who have suffered from war, it is like a ray of light in the darkness. Whether the people nationwide can escape from the abyss of suffering and realize a happy and joyful life will depend on the outcome of these peace talks. Therefore, all the people in the country, whether in the north or south, male or female, old or young, watched the government's peace delegation fly north yesterday with urgent anticipation, and earnestly wished the delegation success on their mission, with "only success allowed, no failure permitted." Standing on the people's side, as these peace talks are just beginning, we would like to offer a few points for the reference of the Kuomintang and Communist Party peace talk representatives.

First, the peace talk representatives of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party must stand on the side of the people. Although we are not excessively superstitious about theories such as "sovereignty rests with the people" or the "people's century," we believe that the power of the people is great, and the trend of public opinion cannot be defied. Any government that is detached from the people, no matter how strong its military force may be, will eventually collapse. Any political party, no matter how great its momentum, if it does not have the people as its foundation and blindly believes in military force, will inevitably fail in the end if it carries the war through to the end. Such historical lessons are countless and cannot be enumerated. This must be known to the peace talk representatives of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. It is remembered that when the Kuomintang launched the Northern Expedition in the fifteenth and sixteenth years of the Republic of China, they called their army the National Revolutionary Army. Today, the CCP also calls its army the "People's Liberation Army." Although there is a difference between "national" and "people" in the wording, their meaning is the same. When translated into English, both are "People." Therefore, today, when the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are conducting peace talks, they must stand on the side of the people. Otherwise, the peace talks will lose their meaning.

Second, only by conducting peace talks under the principle of "the people's interests above all else" can the peace talks have a bright future. The joys and sorrows, separations and reunions, between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have a history of thirty years. The new and old grievances between them are innumerable. If today's peace talks still do not forget revenge and insist that blood debts must be repaid with blood, then we can assert that the peace talks have no future at all. Conversely, if the representatives of both sides can abandon their petty prejudices and focus on the bigger picture, taking the interests of the people and the happiness of the country as a prerequisite, then there is absolutely no hatred in the world that cannot be resolved. In particular, in the political struggles between political parties, success should not be taken as glory, and failure need not be considered a great shame. The outdated notion of "become king if successful, become a bandit if defeated" must not be allowed to remain in today's era of party politics. We would like to remind the peace talk representatives of both sides that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party often tout themselves as "serving the country and the people." The people have already heard enough. Who is genuine and who is fake? These peace talks are an excellent touchstone. Today, the people throughout the country are suffering from the torment of war and can no longer survive. The nation and the people have reached the beginning of survival and extinction. The severity of the situation is greater than when the Kuomintang and the Communist Party cooperated in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan. If the two sides still cannot embrace and cry together, resolve their grievances and make peace, unite as one, and build an independent, prosperous, healthy, and free new China, what are they talking about "serving the country and the people"! Whichever side it is, it will be abandoned by the people.

Third, we must further point out, what is the people's position? What are the people's interests? Frankly speaking, whether it is the common people in the government-controlled area or the people in the Communist-controlled area, their positions are consistent, and their interests are the same. In other words, their position is peace, and their benefit is peace. Peace is supreme, peace is first, peace is above all else. We hope that the government representatives will tell the CCP representatives in detail about the situation of the people in Jiangnan living in dire straits and their urgent desire for peace, so that they can realize that making peace at this time can best win the hearts of the people. However, if they disregard the life and death of the people and act willfully, they will be abandoned by the people. On the other hand, the government representatives should also take the opportunity during the peace talks to investigate the lives and feelings of the people in the CCP-controlled area, so that although the people throughout the country are geographically divided into government-controlled areas and CCP-controlled areas, they are still a whole in terms of emotion and cannot be separated. Let this public opinion have supreme authority, so that neither the Kuomintang nor the Communist Party can stubbornly adhere to its own party's or individual's private interests, and will have to obey the will of the people and achieve the task of peace talks.

When the government representatives left Nanjing, they issued a written statement, expressing their feeling of being in a deep abyss and walking on thin ice, deeply feeling that these peace talks are related to the nation's destiny and the people's livelihood. They also pointed out that if both sides can conduct peace talks in a spirit of mutual trust, mutual understanding, and mutual concession, there are no insurmountable difficulties. This attitude of being neither humble nor arrogant and being pragmatic is indeed worthy of our admiration and will be unanimously supported by the people throughout the country. At the same time, we only hope that the CCP representatives will also embrace this spirit of "just ask for cultivation, don't ask for harvest," sit down calmly and calmly, and conduct peace talks with the government representatives. If the two sides can treat each other with sincerity and forbear each other for the sake of peace, then the future of the peace talks is bright. Even if there are twists and turns in the process of the peace talks, as long as the people throughout the country can exert the power of being the masters of their own affairs at any time, supervise from the sidelines, and only allow success and not allow failure, the future result will surely enable the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to resolve their grievances and make peace, and will surely enable the whole country to turn hostility into peace and harmony, dispel the smoke of war in the Chinese sky, and radiate the sunshine of peace!

### Investigation of Smuggling of Cash Currency - Concealment of Amount Shared - Qingdao Garrison Headquarters Internal Personnel - Law Enforcement Violating the Law in Corruption - Liu Anqi Furious, All Colleagues in the Garrison Headquarters Deeply Indignant - Chief of Staff Dismissed, Chief Inspector Etc. Have Been Detained

[Our Qingdao Dispatch on the 1st] A corruption case has occurred at the Qingdao Garrison Headquarters, where law enforcement violated the law, involving quite a few people, including Chief of Staff of the Garrison Headquarters Huang Gonglu. Upon learning of this, Sui District Commander and Garrison Commander Liu Anqi was greatly angered and first dismissed Huang from his post and transferred him to a high-level staff position in the Sui District, with the vacancy filled by He Jihou, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Sui District. Zhang Tong, Chief Inspector of the Inspection Office of the Garrison Headquarters, and Yu Jingchen, Station Chief of the Xiaogang Inspection Station, were detained and handed over to the Military Law Office of the Garrison Headquarters for strict investigation and reporting for handling. This case has not only been widely circulated and discussed in various circles, but also all colleagues in the Sui District Garrison Headquarters are deeply indignant at this behavior that destroys discipline.

The Course of Events - The Investigation Has Clues

Since receiving the case on the 22nd of last month, the Military Law Office of the Garrison Headquarters has been conducting continuous interrogations in the spirit of military law. According to Military Law Officer Dang Zhixian, he has not been able to sleep peacefully for five days and nights. However, during the investigation, it was not convenient to make any announcements internally or externally. There are now concrete clues, and the criminal suspicion is extremely serious. It may be necessary to form a joint trial court, and after the verdict, it will be submitted for approval. The course of events of the case is as follows: On the 13th of last month, the Xiaogang Inspection Station of the Garrison Headquarters discovered that a certain merchant was smuggling 38 million Gold Yuan Certificates from a certain place, packed in several sacks. According to the Measures for Restricting the Entry of Cash Currency implemented by the Sui District on February 22, only 100,000 yuan were allowed to be carried per person. Once the excess amount was discovered, it would be handed over to the Central Bank for freezing, and a daily limit of 10,000 yuan would be withdrawn each day (it seems that there has been no change recently due to changes in currency values). If the relationship of smuggling is investigated in depth, there will naturally be other discoveries. However, after the huge sum of money was discovered, the station chief of the inspection station, Yu Jingchen, and the chief inspector, Zhang Tong, etc., arbitrarily returned 20 million yuan, detained 18 million yuan, and reported it to the Garrison Headquarters for handling. When the Chief of Staff signed the document, he falsely reported it as 1.8 million yuan, deleting a zero, and putting 16.2 million yuan into their own pockets. After this incident occurred, rumors spread on the road. After someone secretly reported it to Commander Liu Anqi, it was finally exposed. When Zhang Tong was detained, 25 taels of gold and 150 US dollars were found in his residence. It is reported that Zhang Tong, etc., have confessed the situation in the Military Law Office in detail, and it involves quite a few people. Another news said: Huang Gonglu only has the suspicion of dereliction of duty, etc. At present, the trend is that Zhang Tong seems to be mainly responsible, but people believe that this lieutenant colonel chief inspector does not have the courage to take sole responsibility. According to Chief of Staff He Jihou, the environment in Qingdao is complicated, and the work of the Garrison Headquarters is extremely important. He has no comment on the case of the previous Chief of Staff, but it will be handled according to law. Military Law Officer Dang Zhixian has already summoned several related persons, but the owner of the money has not yet been summoned.

The Opium Trafficking Case Is Also Under Investigation

Another news said: On the 13th of last month, Song Shaojin, Liu Pinsan, Yu Xihou, etc., who were from Haiyang City at No. 69 Cixiang Road in this city, were secretly reported to have established a firm and smuggled and trafficked opium from the Communist area. That night, the military police宪 conducted a search, and Zhang Tong was also one of the searchers. It is reported that suspicious bills and other suspicious objects were found. They are still detained at the Garrison Headquarters, and the whole case has not yet been announced. It is reported that this case is also within the scope of the investigation.

### The Fuel Shortage in Qingdao Is Serious - The Consumption of the Garrison Troops Is Astonishing - Worth 1,000 Taels of Gold Per Month - The Trees in the Suburbs Have Been Almost Cut Down, Gradually Extending into the Urban Area

[Our Qingdao Dispatch on the 31st] Military information: The Qingdao garrison troops regularly maintain tens of thousands of people. The fuel shortage is becoming increasingly serious. The trees in the suburbs have been almost completely cut down. Recently, the phenomenon of armed tree cutting has gradually extended into the urban area. It is estimated that if calculated in terms of coal, it would cost 1,000 taels of gold per month to ensure an adequate supply. At present, the source of coal is difficult, and the famous Qingdao is feeling the threat of becoming a barren mountain. In addition to borrowing 1,200 tons of coal from China Textile and the power plant to meet urgent needs, Mayor Qin Decun also summoned representatives from the power plant, China Textile, and the shipping industry on the 31st to discuss the issue of exchanging materials for coal between Qingdao and Tianjin. This suggestion was originally telegraphed by the three parties to the Tianjin Industrial Association and received a reply expressing agreement in principle. At yesterday's meeting of the municipal government, it was decided to send two representatives to Tianjin and to establish a special agency to handle the matter, but no specific decisions were made on the selection of representatives and the organizational methods of the agency. Another meeting will be convened tomorrow, and the ratio issue will be discussed in detail so that the two representatives can discuss it with Tianjin merchants.

[Our Qingdao Dispatch on the 1st] Xu Yiguan, director of the Qingdao Power Plant, returned to Qingdao after completing negotiations on purchasing Taiwanese coal in Shanghai. According to him, he has reached an agreement with the United Office of the Four Mines in Taiwan to purchase 10,000 tons of coal per month in cash. The first batch is expected to arrive in Qingdao on the 6th of this month.

### The Land Reform Plan in Western Fujian Has Been Approved - Institutions Are Being Established to Fully Implement It

The district has now established a Land Reform Supervision Office to oversee the land reform work. The counties under its jurisdiction, such as Changting, Yongding, Liancheng, Wuping, and Zhangping, have also generally established land administration offices and land reform promotion associations. Land reform committees are set up in each township and sub-committees are set up in each bao to fully promote the work. The land reform committee in each township and bao is jointly organized by three tenant farmer representatives, one hired farmer representative, one owner-cultivator representative, two landlord representatives, one representative from the local public opinion body, the township and bao chief (designated as the chairman), and one land administration official appointed by the government.

Press releases regarding the peace delegation were the most important thing for reporters on the morning of the 1st, so without thinking about whether it was true or false, they all rushed to the Capital Hotel. When they arrived, they realized that they had been fooled. This was the most elegant and effective program on April Fool's Day.

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch on the 1st] On April Fool's Day in Lanzhou, the newspapers agreed to publish that Mayor Sun's wife had given birth to triplets.

[Our Chongqing Dispatch on the 1st] The teachers' association of the eight provincial middle schools in Chongqing Province sent more than 30 representatives to Commissioner of Education Chuan Qixue on March 30 to petition, requesting (1) that salaries for April 1 to 10 be paid immediately, with 40,900 yuan per person according to the cost of living index.

If there is no result, they will decide to suspend teaching and wait for orders.

[Our Chongqing Dispatch on the 1st] Wang Lingji telegraphed the Sui Jing Gong Shu on the 1st, hoping that the teachers of provincial schools would be paid in silver dollars according to the August 19 standard. The treatment of provincial schools in the Chongqing area is required to be in accordance with the standards of the fourth district, and to be paid before the 5th of each month. In addition, the National Zigong College sent a telegram on the 1st requesting improved treatment and went on strike for five days from the 29th.

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch on the 1st] The professors of Zhongshan University took a general leave, which expired yesterday. However, the authorities have not yet responded to the request for improved living conditions. After several heated debates at the board of directors of the professors' association, it was decided to continue the leave for two days and wait for orders.

[Our Fuzhou Dispatch on the 1st] The students in the provincial middle schools of Rongcheng launched a support movement for the teachers' struggle for survival on the 31st. The autonomous federation organized a propaganda team to sing and speak in various thoroughfares, posting slogans with enthusiastic emotions. The provincial authorities maintained a silent attitude.

[Our Qingdao Dispatch on the 1st] Shandong University's Department of Aquatic Products decided to move to Shanghai for management due to the departure of professors from Qingdao. The instruments were scheduled to be transported to Shanghai by the Jingxing ship on the 1st. The students of the department expressed their opposition and, after a resolution by the autonomous conference, requested that the school withdraw its order and move the instruments away for automatic safekeeping. The school's persuasion was ineffective. The school has been suspended since the 30th and resumed classes on the morning of the 1st. Sixty students from the Department of Aquatic Products who were willing to move south to attend classes took the Jingxing ship to Shanghai at 1:00 p.m. on the 1st. In addition, two professors from the Department of Aquatic Products have agreed to remain in Qingdao. The autonomous association posted a notice saying that the matter has been resolved satisfactorily.

[Our Hankou Dispatch on the 1st] More than 3,000 staff, students, and family members of Anhui University have fallen into a desperate situation.

People in the local education community, doctors, and alumni of the school who have stayed in Hankou are extremely anxious.

### The Burmese War Is Pressing on Yunnan - Yunnan's Border Is Intensifying Defenses

[Our Kunming Dispatch on the 1st] After the Burmese rebels captured Wacheng, they occupied Bhamo on the 30th. The war is getting closer to Yunnan.

### Gansu Province's Construction Bonds Are Stopped from Issuance - Guo Jiyao Complies with Student Opinions

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch on the 1st] Gansu Provincial Chairman Guo Jiyao met with reporters at his official residence at 10:00 p.m. on the 31st and issued a statement regarding the Gansu students' opposition to the issuance of construction bonds, saying: The students have pure hearts and have witnessed the suffering of farmers, so their expression is justified. However, the issuance of bonds was originally intended to have the rich contribute money so that the province's industrial and mining industries would not collapse, rural side occupations would gradually develop, and people's livelihoods would gradually stabilize. It is not a good way to save the social crisis by our own efforts. The students have failed to understand this intention and do not agree with it. The provincial government has decided to adopt the students' opinions and stop the issuance. He also said: As long as it is good for Gansu Province, the provincial government has no prejudices. Guo added at the end: If there is any fault in the political measures, it is my sole fault. If I am to bear any responsibility, I am personally willing to bear it. He deeply apologized for the criticism of the provincial senators who passed the bill.

[Our Changsha Dispatch on the 1st] Yin Liyan in Wugang, calling himself the "Southwest Commander-in-Chief of the People's Revolutionary Army," has been calling for war and recently sent underground personnel to Changsha to distribute various absurd propaganda materials. The names on the documents were "Meng Gong, President of the New China Party, and Yin Chongyi, Vice President and Commander-in-Chief of the New China Revolutionary Army" (Note: Yin Chongyi is Yin Liyan, and it is not known who the President Meng Gong is). In order to stabilize local order, Chairman Cheng telegraphed all agencies and troops in the province on the 31st, explaining that Hunan Province has not yet recovered its vitality and the national situation is turbulent, and that no traitors are allowed to cause trouble.

[Our Changsha Dispatch on the 1st] Anjiang and Hongjiang were extremely tense from the afternoon of the 31st to the morning of the 1st.

### More Than 180,000 Bales of American Cotton - To Be Shipped to China Within Three Months - ECA Will Continue to Work as Usual

[This City News] According to an announcement by the ECA, approximately 187,000 bales of raw cotton from the ECA are scheduled to be shipped to China within April, May, and June. This raw cotton includes the 5,000 bales currently being unloaded in Shanghai, the 87,000 bales already en route or about to be shipped from the United States to China, and the 95,000 bales recently approved for purchase by the ECA headquarters in Washington.

[This City News] From a legal point of view, the ECA ended at midnight yesterday. However, the Chinese and foreign staff of the ECA cannot be dismissed immediately before receiving notice. Therefore, all work will continue as usual. Salaries for the next two weeks have been prepared in advance, but if the parliament cannot allocate funds by April 20, the staff will inevitably have to "work on an empty stomach." According to senior officials, if the financial difficulties are such that the funds cannot be allocated, they will also use legal procedures to use the stored rice and flour for funding. As far as the promotion of aid-to-China plans is concerned, even if the parliament delays passing the bill, there will be no impact, as the appropriations for food and oil have been approved for use until June, and the same is true for raw cotton. Of the total economic aid of 275 million yuan, there is still 54 million yuan left. The American parliament is now planning to extend the life of the ECA until the end of this year or February next year, but the use of funds is limited to this. It is not yet known whether this proposal will be successfully passed, but it can be said with certainty that even if the bill is not passed, the ECA has sufficient funds to handle the closing work in an orderly manner.

### Silver Dollars in Changsha Skyrocket - Shops Are Empty

[Our Changsha Dispatch on the 1st] The silver dollar in Changsha has skyrocketed to 17,500 yuan. Businesses are empty due to weak purchasing power, and are in a state of suffocation. In the past, only salaried workers complained, but now businessmen are also in trouble.

### The Soviet Union Sends Separate Notes to Seven Western Nations Protesting the North Atlantic Treaty, Denouncing it as a Violation of International Agreements and Manifestly Aggressive; The U.S., Britain, and France Believe the Soviet Accusations are Utterly Groundless

[United Press International, Moscow, 1st] Yesterday, the Soviet Union sent memoranda to the governments of the seven nations that initiated the North Atlantic Treaty—Britain, the United States, France, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg—denouncing the treaty as open aggression against the Soviet Union and a violation of five international agreements. All Moscow morning newspapers published the full text of the memorandum on their front pages, but without commentary. The memorandum concludes with the following three points: (1) The North Atlantic Treaty is openly aggressive in nature and is directed against the Soviet Union. (2) It violates the United Nations Charter. (3) It undermines the Anglo-Soviet and Franco-Soviet treaties of friendship and non-aggression, the Yalta Agreement, and the Potsdam Agreement. The Soviet Union does not accept the treaty's claim that it is strictly defensive and complies with UN principles, stating that official representatives of the U.S., Britain, and France have clearly indicated that the treaty is aimed at the Soviet Union and other communist countries in Eastern Europe. The participating countries are all engaged in military preparations, such as stockpiling atomic bombs, which are not defensive in nature. The participating countries have maintained the Anglo-American Combined Chiefs of Staff from the last war in Washington, established the Western European Union defense organization in Fontainebleau outside Paris, and now plan to establish a defense committee under the new treaty. All of this only increases anxiety and panic, and stirs up war hysteria. The real purpose of the treaty is to intimidate countries that are unwilling to obey the orders of the Anglo-American bloc.

[Our Own Dispatch] Washington, 1st (Broadcast): A spokesman for the U.S. State Department has flatly denied the Soviet claim that the purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty is to attack the Soviet Union. The spokesman said that the Soviet propaganda is intended solely to create confusion. However, U.S. officials do not feel surprised by the Soviet accusations.

[Reuters, Washington, 1st] Following the Soviet Union's protest to the signatory nations of the North Atlantic Treaty, the immediate reaction here is that this move represents no significant progress over the Soviet government's foreign policy statement of January 29. The Soviet protest merely condemns the Atlantic Treaty without demanding any action, indicating that Moscow intends to use this protest as a propaganda ploy, rather than a genuine diplomatic protest.

[United Press International, London, 1st] A British Foreign Office spokesman, regarding the Soviet Union's note protesting the North Atlantic Treaty, said that it is regrettable that the Soviet Union is repeating Stalin and Lenin's assertion that the world must be divided into two parts. He continued that the British government will formally respond to the Soviet note in due course. The reply will likely point out, as Foreign Secretary Bevin stated in the House of Commons last month, that the Atlantic Treaty contains no secret clauses and that any country without aggressive aims or intentions need not fear this treaty. The Soviet Union today appears to have laid the foundation for completely severing relations with the West in order to oppose the Atlantic Treaty. This could include the Soviet Union's withdrawal from the United Nations, should the Soviet Union choose this drastic measure.

[United Press International, Paris, 1st] A French Foreign Office spokesman stated on the 1st that the Soviet note accusing the Atlantic Treaty of being an anti-Soviet alliance is "completely unfounded." Referring to the Franco-Soviet Agreement of 1944, the spokesman emphasized that the agreement does not conflict with the Atlantic Treaty.

### Following British Foreign Secretary Bevin, Acheson and Schuman Confer, Exchanging Views on Issues Such as West Germany

[Our Own Dispatch] Washington, 1st (Broadcast): French Foreign Minister Schuman, after a one-and-a-half-hour discussion with Acheson, stated, "We exchanged views on several key issues, including the German question. Although the time was short and we were unable to discuss them in detail, we at least gained an outline. I hope that all issues can achieve good results during my stay in the United States." Schuman said, "It is not yet known when discussions on the issue of Italian colonies will begin, but since this matter has already been placed on the UN General Assembly's agenda, there is no need for me to raise it again."

[United Press International, Washington, 31st] Secretary of State Acheson held a secret two-hour meeting with British Foreign Secretary Bevin today. A brief statement was issued after the meeting, stating that the Secretary of State and Mr. Bevin discussed several European issues of mutual concern, particularly a comprehensive review of the West German issue, and exchanged views on the situation in Greece, but no decisions were made. It is reported that the two believe that the West German issue can be resolved at the upcoming meeting of the foreign ministers of the U.S., Britain, and France next week.

[Reuters, Washington, 1st] The foreign ministers of Portugal, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland arrived here last night. The State Department announced today that the foreign ministers of twelve countries will participate in the signing of the Atlantic Treaty on April 4. The twelve countries are Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Canada, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Iceland, and the United States. Portuguese Foreign Minister Mateus stated that Portugal will take into account the interests of the Iberian Bloc in every step of implementing the Atlantic Treaty. (Portugal and Spain concluded the Iberian Bloc agreement in 1943, stipulating that the two countries should consult with each other on major events.) The foreign ministers of France and the Netherlands are scheduled to hold individual talks with Acheson today. The Great Hall of the State Department is being actively decorated in preparation for the treaty signing ceremony on the 4th. Although President Truman will attend only as a guest, he will be present to deliver a speech.

### A Diplomatic Dilemma in the Treaty Signing Ceremony: Should the Soviet Ambassador Be Invited to Attend?

[United Press International, Washington, 31st] The Treaty Division of the U.S. State Department is trying to find a win-win solution to avoid inviting the Soviet Ambassador to the U.S., Pan Youxin, to the signing ceremony of the Atlantic Treaty. Experts in the Treaty Division have been racking their brains all week to resolve this matter. For a treaty signing ceremony like this, all diplomatic envoys in the U.S. should be invited as a matter of etiquette, including Pan Youxin. Another common approach is not to invite anyone. However, the State Department only wants to invite foreign envoys who are sympathetic to the Atlantic Treaty, which seems to have two solutions: Perhaps Pan Youxin will not come; or simply invite all foreign envoys and risk a confrontation, or perhaps Pan Youxin will refuse to attend the ceremony. (2) Take a risk and only invite foreign envoys welcomed by the United States, risking condemnation from the Soviet Union. The protocol authorities now believe they have finally found a solution, as it is rumored that foreign envoys willing to participate in the ceremony have hinted, what if Pan Youxin really comes? Only heaven knows.

### Internal Division in Bulgaria: Rumors of Deputy Prime Minister Under House Arrest

[United Press International, London, 1st] Despite denials from Bulgarian officials, rumors of a major split among Bulgarian Communist leaders continued to circulate on the 1st. The Yugoslav official news agency "Tanjug" reported that 100 Bulgarian Communists had been arrested in Bulgaria on charges of espionage. A Bulgarian Foreign Ministry spokesman dismissed the report as "absurd and unfounded," but Western diplomats claim to have reliable information that a split is underway within the Bulgarian Communist Party. The split is reportedly between Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov and Deputy Prime Minister Kostov. Dimitrov is a key member of the Comintern, while Kostov, once considered Dimitrov's most likely successor, is a domestic Communist who may oppose taking orders from Moscow. Western sources here say that Kostov is now under house arrest, which is consistent with what "Tanjug" reported.

### Composition of Our Delegation to Attend This Year's UN General Assembly; U.S. to Suggest Restrictions on the Use of the Veto

The head of the French delegation is Foreign Minister Schuman, and the head of the British delegation is Deputy Foreign Minister McNeil.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 31st] U.S. representative to the United Nations, Austin, stated that the General Assembly will again discuss the veto issue based on a report drafted by the U.S. delegation. According to the report's recommendations, the use of the veto should be changed "in certain matters."

### Australia and India Request the UN General Assembly to Discuss the Indonesian Question

[United Press International, Lake Success, 31st] The governments of Australia and India jointly sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Lai Yi today, requesting that the Indonesian-Dutch dispute be included on the agenda of the UN General Assembly next Tuesday. The issue has been on the Security Council's agenda since July 1, 1947, and may now be returned to the General Assembly for discussion.

### Chinese Representative Li Zhuomin at the Asian Economic Conference Opposes Japan Becoming an Industrial Power Again; Asian Countries All Point to Japan's March Toward War

[United Press International, Bangkok, 31st] At a meeting of the Comprehensive Group of the Economic Commission for the Far East and Asia today, Chinese representative Li Zhuomin spoke out against Japan becoming a major industrial nation in Asia again. It is said that most Asian countries have recognized that Japan is developing into a new war machine. Japan's lack of U.S. dollars is a direct result of Japan's launching of war. Earlier, Major General Cushing, representative of MacArthur's headquarters, stated that those controlling Japanese organizations felt that Japan's future trading methods must change in order to export machinery and production equipment. In the next five years, Japan can export goods worth 200 million yuan annually.

MacArthur's headquarters encouraged barter trade agreements in order to obtain supplies of raw materials and food. Indian representative Yadaka stated that some Asian countries fear Japan's development. Soviet representative Nencheina stated that the group had no right to discuss any aspect of the Japanese economy, and that economic issues should be discussed by the Far Eastern Commission or other controlling organizations. Also, at a meeting of the Industrial Group, French representative Mao Helie listed the dangers of allowing Japan to manufacture steel, and the Chinese representative supported the French position.

### Churchill Delivers Speech in Boston, Calling on the World to Defend Freedom, Condemning the Soviet Union's Attempt to Dominate the World; Concerned About the Situation in China, Calling it a Tragedy Since Victory

[Reuters, Boston, Massachusetts, 31st] Churchill delivered a world-renowned speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology tonight, stating that the incorporation of China and India into the Communist empire controlled by the Kremlin would undoubtedly bring endless bloodshed and suffering to 800 to 900 million people. Churchill also said that if the United States did not possess the atomic bomb, Europe might have already been communized some time ago, and London might have already been bombed. Churchill accused the thirteen giants in the Kremlin of suppressing hundreds of millions of people and attempting to dominate the world. Today, Europe is shrouded in the shadow of fear.

Churchill also loudly appealed: We must take care of both Asia and Europe at the same time. In Europe, the situation is fortunately maintained thanks to the Berlin Airlift, but in Asia, China's submission to Communist attacks and conspiracies is the worst tragedy of the Allied victory in World War II.

More Cunning Than Hitler

Christian culture is now facing a more cunning and powerful force than Hitler, and the unity of the English-speaking nations is currently the only way to save ourselves. Behind the Kremlin, there are envoys stationed in every country as its fifth column, and there is the world's largest army, controlled by a government that is implementing a policy of imperialist expansion even worse than the Tsars or the German emperors. But Churchill also said: War is not inevitable. He does not advocate taking violent action immediately, and hope and patience should not be abandoned immediately. Many beneficial methods are already being launched. Under the threat of communism, free countries have engaged in unprecedented unity. Churchill strongly stated that we have no animosity towards the Soviet people, nor do we intend to deny their legitimate rights and security. Our goals and principles remain unchanged, and we are willing to view Russians around the world as brothers in the human family. What we ask of the Soviet Union is only goodwill and fairness. However, if a war of nerves has already begun, then we must develop our strong nerves. We will unite all thoughts and superhuman science to defend freedom. This is the best way to avoid a third world war, and it is also the surest way to survive this crisis without enslavement and destruction.

More Than 10,000 Audience Members

British wartime Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology memorial event in Boston Garden. There were 14,000 audience members in the venue, and the three major British broadcasting companies also used radio and fax machines to transmit Churchill's speech to various places. His audience, including some of the world's most famous scientists, were all intently absorbing the speech of this premier contemporary speaker. The numbers at the end of Churchill's speech reminded people of his famous speeches during the war. He said, "Let us bravely move forward and fulfill our mission and responsibility, fearing nothing except God." Other key points in Churchill's speech are as follows: He said that one of the characteristics of the twentieth century is that more people have been able to share the lives previously enjoyed by a few. We all wish that the masses in every land can have adequate food and clothing, then only continuous improvement of technology production and improvement of the education of hundreds of millions of men and women can achieve this, even in the current dark period, I still believe this can be done. We now have all the resources of modern science. If we still cannot avoid world famine, it should be blamed on all of us, and scientists in particular should be responsible. If scientists cannot do this, then humanity will inevitably conflict due to unequal enjoyment.

Avoiding a Third World War

Churchill also said that the United Nations organization has lost its effectiveness due to Soviet hostility and the division between communism and the rest of humanity, but we must not be discouraged, we must unite all superhuman thoughts and scientific forces to defend freedom. This is the best hope for avoiding a third world war, and it is also the only way to avoid recovery and destruction. The Soviet Union fears the friendship of Western countries more than the hostility of Western countries, so the Soviet Union has adopted a shocking policy of not allowing friendly relations to develop in the areas it controls. Churchill believes that the twentieth century is a century full of storms and changes.

### Soaring Grain Prices Cause Public Suffering; City Government Holds Emergency Meeting, Deciding on Two Countermeasures: Strictly Prohibit Off-Market Transactions and Dredge Grain Sources

[Our Own Dispatch] Rice prices have been soaring continuously in recent days. Yesterday, white japonica rice rose to 117,000 yuan per dan, and the retail price of rice has broken through the 120,000 yuan mark. Due to the skyrocketing rice prices, the common people are all complaining endlessly. The city government authorities are paying close attention to this matter. Yesterday afternoon, City Secretary-General Chen Liang convened responsible persons from the Social Affairs Bureau, the Civil Food Allocation Office, the Grain Emergency Procurement and Storage Committee, the Rice Industry Association, the North and South Rice Markets, and other agencies and organizations to hold an emergency meeting. There was a thorough discussion of the reasons for the skyrocketing rice prices and ways to suppress them. Two solutions were decided upon: (1) Strictly prohibit off-market transactions in the rice market that arbitrarily raise prices. (2) Find ways to dredge grain sources so that the supply of rice in the city is not in short supply. Starting today, the Social Affairs Bureau will send senior officials to the North and South Rice Markets to supervise and stop illegal merchants from bidding prices outside the market. According to responsible persons in the rice market, the reasons for the skyrocketing rice prices are: (1) The release of 5,000 yuan and 10,000 yuan banknotes. (2) The publication of the index, causing prices to generally rise by about 20%. (3) Prices in the producing areas have risen, and the source of supply is not smooth. It is said that these three factors have stimulated this crazy surge in rice prices.

### Garrison Command Attaches Importance to Two Murder Cases, Meets with Various Agencies, Decides on Steps to Take

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the successive occurrence of the boxed corpse case and the dismembered corpse case in this city, the Garrison Headquarters attaches great importance to these tragic cases, which have greatly affected public security and morale. In addition to instructing the relevant public security agencies to investigate strictly, it has also convened a meeting of the Railway Bureau Police Department, the Police Bureau, the Station Inspection Office, and the Inspection Brigade to conduct extensive discussions on the two cases and decide on the following steps: (1) Request the two Railway Bureaus and the Police Bureau to continue to disclose the process of discovering the corpses or the methods of identifying the corpses, and issue documents to remote areas along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, in the hope of obtaining the names of the deceased.

### Student Relief Association and Other Organizations Visit University Dining Halls: Red Rice and a Few Vegetables, Poor Nutrition Leads to More Lung Disease

[Our Newspaper's Report] Representatives from the National Student Relief Committee of the Chinese Christian YMCA, the Shanghai Student Relief Association, the Chinese Nutrition Promotion Association, and the Welfare Committee of the International Student Chapel, among other organizations, visited the student dining halls of Tongji and Fudan Universities at 4:00 PM yesterday and invited reporters to accompany them. The reason for this was that the Student Relief Association recently received a letter from a group of national university government-sponsored students, stating that the government subsidies for March totaled 8,000 yuan, of which only 2,000 yuan was for vegetables, after deducting expenses for rice, firewood, oil, salt, and other necessities. This averaged 64 yuan per day, so they could only eat "hollowed-out radishes" and "flowering vegetable tips," with no nutrition at all. Some self-funded and partially self-funded students were even unable to pay this amount and would be forced to stop eating at the dining halls. The Chinese Nutrition Promotion Association analyzed the poor nutrition situation of the students, and the Student Relief Association investigated the students' health. The results showed that the percentage of students with lung disease was very high. This serious phenomenon was entirely due to malnutrition. Tongji students now eat only two meals a day, taking a separate meal system. What they eat is red rice plus a few oil-free vegetables. Fudan students eat at tables of eight, and what they eat is also two vegetarian dishes. Students with money can add dishes to their meals, but those without money can only swallow this unnutritious rice and vegetables every day, and the amount of vegetables is limited. After a bowl of rice, there are no vegetables left, so they simply fill their stomachs with red rice. The representatives who visited yesterday witnessed this situation and unanimously agreed that it was necessary to provide relief and improvement, otherwise, the result of several years of university education would only be many malnourished young people with lung disease. The Student Relief Association is currently studying how to regularly add dishes to the meals of poor students to supplement their nutrition. However, because the funds subsidized by foreign countries are limited, it is hoped that all sectors of society and the government will pay attention to this serious problem and provide poor students with sufficient and adequate nutrition.

### North China and Northeast Refugee Students Send Representatives to Beijing to Petition for Resolution of Academic Issues

They have established the Northeast and North China Shanghai Student Association. Yesterday, they sent seven representatives to Beijing by night train to request instructions from the Ministry of Education on the issue of schools for temporary study and to urge Minister Hang to actively plan for the establishment of a Southeast United University to accommodate them. The students living in the refugee camp are mostly sharing one cotton quilt provided by the refugee camp between two people, and the clothes they brought have almost all been sold. It is hoped that the education authorities and people from all walks of life will cooperate to solve the most urgent problems of clothing, food, and housing for them.

### The Annual Embellishment: Many "April Fool's" Lies, Countless Strange News, Seeking Pleasure by Any Means

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was the "April Fool's Day" of 1949, and people from all walks of life had long been wary, fearing being fooled. However, news intended to fool people still appeared a lot during the day. The most moving was the rumor that Bei Zuyi telegraphed from the United States that the US government had approved a silver loan of 500 million ounces, and that the National Bank had designated Lin Chongyong to go to Washington to negotiate transportation matters. This news initially made a group of bulls in the market very excited, but after two more sober-minded people pointed it out, the transaction continued as before, without any impact. In addition, at noon, many people in the office area were running around spreading the word: Acting President Li had ordered a ceasefire in the early morning, Mao Zedong had another relapse of cerebral congestion, and Song Ziwen was suddenly assassinated and died, etc. It is said that these were all urgent telegrams from Nanjing, absolutely true, but in the end, after an inquiry, it was just laughed off.

The April Fool's Day news did not end there. In the afternoon, someone said that Zhang Xueliang had been released to Shanghai and was staying at the Cathay Hotel, causing reporters to run to the Cathay Hotel and ask Manager Lin several times. Some evening newspapers published that Miss Liu Banye, head of the Municipal Government's Protocol Section, was engaged at the Hua Mao Hotel in the afternoon, but the news did not mention the name of her "husband" at all. There was also a rumor that Zhu Xubai, head of the News Office, won the first prize in the last charity lottery. Zhu told people: "If it's true, that would be great!" There was also a bad one, which was Fan Xuejun. A newspaper said that she committed suicide by poisoning the night before and was scheduled to be cremated at the Chinese Funeral Home yesterday afternoon, and also published a "portrait." Heaven knows, Fan Xuejun was still excitedly rushing to the various book venues yesterday afternoon!

The newspaper received a submission from a reader the day before yesterday, which said that "young writer Sun Yuehan has committed suicide by jumping off the 14th floor of the International Hotel." The letter also included a photo of Sun, who looked very handsome. This was of course good news, but after the reporter carefully reviewed it, a flaw appeared. Perhaps this friend seeking pleasure did not notice that his letter said that Sun's suicide time was around 5:00 PM on the 31st, but the time we received the letter on that day was not yet 4:00!

### The Children's Theater Troupe Works Hard, Often Performs for Children for Free, Statistics Show 100,000 Little Audience Members in Two Years Since Establishment

[Our Newspaper's Report] Soong Ching-ling's China Welfare Fund invited the press yesterday to visit the three children's welfare stations and the children's theater troupe established by the fund.

Children's drama work is still in its infancy in our country. The children's theater troupe of the fund has been established for two years and is a theater troupe for children and belonging to children. It has performed two plays, "The Watch" and "The Little Circus," at the Lanxin Theater, and often performs for free in poor areas. Statistics show that there have been 100,000 little audience members. Currently, there are 34 members, aged ten to eighteen, all of whom are poor children recruited through open examinations. The courses are divided into two classes, A and B. Each class is set for one year. Classes are held for six hours a day. In addition to the main subjects of music, dance, and drama, subjects such as Chinese, general knowledge, and arithmetic are also taught. Students in Class B are responsible for their own meals. After completing the basic course for one year, they will be promoted to Class A and can enjoy government-funded treatment, with the theater troupe bearing the living expenses. In one year, they must learn to teach others (be a little teacher), sing, make scenery, write articles, make costumes, dance, manage lighting, and act. Recently, the theater troupe created a puppet show, "Happy Days," which is deeply educational and has been very successful. It is currently planning to adapt and perform "The Adventures of Sanmao." These days, because Children's Day is approaching, elementary schools, people's schools, poor children's homes, reformatories, and other institutions have been contacting the troupe to perform song and dance dramas. From March 30th to April 6th, the troupe has scheduled programs and will be running around east and west every day, performing a total of fourteen shows. In the future, it is also preparing to perform a free matinee performance at the Municipal Drama School every other Sunday.

The China Welfare Fund Currently Has Three Major Tasks

In addition to the "Sanmao Paradise Movement" currently underway, the current work of the China Welfare Fund roughly consists of three parts: (1) Education work, divided into literacy classes and libraries. There are already one hundred literacy classes with more than 2,500 students. The library collects various children's books, and more than 1,000 children go to read every week. The children's library at the First Children's Welfare Station is the second largest in the city. (2) Health and nutrition work: Each children's welfare station now has a clinic to treat children's diseases and provide vaccinations. In addition, more than 1,200 poor infants under twelve months of age can receive three pounds of milk powder per month, and cod liver oil is often distributed. (3) Material distribution: When the fund's welfare stations receive donations from abroad or materials allocated domestically, they are distributed to the poor in need. The distributed materials include old clothes, cloth, and sweep-floor rice. In addition, there is a work-for-relief program, teaching the older girls in the literacy classes to sew clothes for other children. The most important work of each children's welfare station is to make home visits to nearby poor areas and assist in solving various difficult problems such as education and medical care. Currently, a mother's meeting is held every week to implement health and nutrition county education work for mothers.

### A Few University Students Have Transgressed: Police Department Says They Will Be Suppressed, Those Who Do Not Accept Persuasion Will Be Sent to the Communist Area

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, a spokesman for the Songhu Garrison Command said: Recently, a small number of students from colleges and universities in this city, such as Fudan and Jiaotong Universities, often take advantage of opportunities to make various excuses and engage in transgressions. For example: (1) Under the pretext of improving treatment, they launch "eat-everything movements," "grievance meetings," and "struggle for survival meetings." (2) They use various gatherings to perform Communist Yangko dances to expand anti-government propaganda. (3) They sing songs welcoming the "Liberation Army" to cross the river. (4) They post slogans insulting the government. (5) They use spring outings to preach to officers and soldiers, undermining military morale. (6) During student union elections, they use the names of Communist army leaders as campaign slogans, such as "Fudan's Mao Zedong." The spokesman said: Although peace talks are about to officially begin, the Communist Party is actively conducting military operations, and it is even more important to maintain public security in the Songhu area. The headquarters will strictly suppress assemblies, petitions, marches, and propaganda that violate the martial law in accordance with the law. If the students do not accept persuasion and insist on going their own way, ignoring right and wrong, the headquarters is willing to find a way to send them to the Communist area for observation and comparison.

[Our Newspaper's Report] A young man in a suit suddenly came to the Datong Leather Shoe Store at No. 369 Tibet Road Central a few days ago and selected a pair of men's leather shoes, a pair of women's leather shoes, and a women's leather bag. He ordered the shop assistant Ma Guohong to take them to Room 204, Yiyilou, Nanjing Road. He paid with a cross-city check from a certain bank on Yunnan Road. Ma went to the bank to cash the check but was rejected. He returned to the original place, but the young man had disappeared without a trace. Knowing that he had been cheated, he reported the situation to the Laozha Police Sub-bureau for investigation. Unexpectedly, the next day, a customer came to the Lidu Department Store at No. 51 Nanjing West Road and selected a shirt, a tie, a wool sweater, and two vests, worth a total of 257,000 yuan. He instructed the clerk to deliver them to Room 204, East Asia Hotel, and then gave a check from the Asia-West Bank. When the check was cashed, it was rejected as before. The guest could not be found, and he was gone as before. The Laozha Police Sub-bureau considered that the circumstances of the two cases were the same and ordered police officers to investigate in all directions. Sure enough, at about 8:00 PM yesterday, they received a tip that a gangster was committing fraud at No. 3, Yong'anli, Jiangning Road. They ordered officers to rush to the scene and arrest him. According to his confession, his name is Han Wenlong, 22 years old, from Ningbo, and he lives at No. 14, Deshengli, Guohuo Road, Nanshi. Because he had been unemployed for a long time, he was forced to resort to this strategy for a living.

### Routine Meeting of the Public Education Material Supply Committee, Decision to Postpone Issuance of April Purchase Certificates

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Public Education Personnel Material Supply Committee held a routine meeting yesterday, chaired by Zeng Gangfu, Chief Secretary of the Supply Committee. The following matters were resolved: (1) The policy of material distribution to public education personnel has been newly decided by the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Conference, but no formal order has arrived, and it is not convenient to handle it without authorization. The issuance of all April material purchase certificates will be temporarily postponed (the key rice distribution certificates will still be issued as usual, issuing them on the 4th to central and Jiangsu provincial agencies stationed in Shanghai, and on the 5th to municipal agencies). As to whether the purchase certificates will be reissued, and if they are replaced with cash, how municipal public education employees will receive them, it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. (2) The Executive Yuan has decided to replace the undistributed cooking oil and coal for January, February, and March of this year with cash. Please ask the Executive Yuan to issue the cash as soon as possible, and please calculate the cash amount based on the market price at the time of issuance. In the future, the calculation of various cash amounts should also be based on the market price at the time of issuance. As for the undistributed cooking oil for December of last year, please still distribute the actual goods. (3) How to handle the summer clothing distribution for this year, please ask the Executive Yuan for approval. (4) The rice cash and oil-coal difference cash for April will also be temporarily postponed due to the postponement of the issuance of material purchase certificates. (5) The deadline for exchanging the March material purchase certificate for rice is extended to the 7th of this month. The deadline for exchanging rice cash is also the 7th. In addition, Chief Secretary Zeng of the committee will go to Beijing in the middle of next week to ask the Executive Yuan for instructions on various distribution-related issues.

### Japanese "Scalper" Found at Hangzhou Station, Passengers Deceived and Report to the Police, Arrested. Claims to Have Served as Lieutenant Medical Officer, Escorted to Shanghai to Consider Handling Method

[Our Newspaper's Report] Due to the increasing number of tourists on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines in recent days, the number of passengers is gradually becoming crowded, and "scalpers" have emerged. The Railway Bureau Police Department has dispatched a large number of police officers to strictly investigate and prohibit them at major stations. A person dressed in a railway worker's uniform who claimed to be Wang Yougui recently appeared in Hangzhou, specializing in buying train tickets for passengers. As a result, he defrauded 16,000 yuan in ticket money and absconded elsewhere. The deceived passengers reported to the railway police. The police section immediately dispatched plainclothes police to investigate and finally arrested the criminal. After questioning, it was discovered that he was actually Japanese, fluent in Nanjing dialect. According to his confession, his name is Maruyama Taiji. In March of the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942), he came to our country with the "Dispatch Army" and was stationed in Hankou. His rank was lieutenant medical officer. After the Japanese army surrendered, he left the troops and hid in the countryside of Nanjing, setting up a clinic to treat villagers. Because the Communist Party later disturbed the area, he was forced to close down and faced financial difficulties. In March of this year, he borrowed a railway worker's uniform from his friend Ye Minfu at No. 9 Baixia Road, Nanjing, and took a train to Hangzhou to find work. After arriving in Hangzhou, he was penniless and was forced to resort to this strategy. The criminal was transferred from Hangzhou to Shanghai yesterday and is temporarily detained in the Railway Bureau's directly affiliated police station detention center. Because Maruyama Taiji has the status of an enemy prisoner, the railway police authorities are currently considering how to handle the case.

### Circus Owner's Inheritance Lawsuit After Death

[Our Newspaper's Report] Sun Fuyou, the owner of a circus, married a Russian woman named Gari while performing abroad in his early years. He then returned to China with her. Gari naturalized and changed her name to Luo Zhangqi. Later, Sun died in Shanghai in the spring of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945). Luo intended to donate a Western-style house and its site at No. 31, Model District, Jiangwan Road, to Sun Yilian, the granddaughter of her deceased husband's other wife. She invited witness Yu Shanchang to apply for a donation registration with the Municipal Land Administration Bureau. Before it was completed, Sun Huiping, Sun's third wife, and her son, Sun Baoshi, and others returned after the war, believing that the house and land were Sun's inheritance and should be inherited by his son. They also applied for a change of registration with the Land Administration Bureau. Luo alleged that the title deeds for the houses and land were all in Luo's name, and that Sun and others were obviously applying for a change of registration with forged documents. She filed a criminal lawsuit with the District Court. The court had advised both parties to reconcile but to no avail. It was opened for trial again yesterday. According to Luo, the property was purchased with her private savings, and she is now willing to donate it to Sun Yilian, Sun's granddaughter. At that time, the registration procedures had not been completed, and Sun Huiping and others returned and falsely claimed that they were willing to urge the completion of the procedures. She

obtained her private seal, counterfeited Sun Yilian's seal, and obtained Luo's identity information, colluding with original witness Yu Shanchang to invite Wang Jinzhen as a witness, forging a donation certificate stating that Luo had changed the donation of the aforementioned property to Sun Baoshi. She claimed a change of registration with the Land Administration Bureau. After it was discovered, she filed a complaint and now only wishes for a judgment ordering the return of the property to Sun Yilian. Defendant Sun Huiping stated: She and Sun Fuyou were married at the Anle Restaurant in Nanjing in September of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933) and had five children. Sun Baoshi is her eldest son. The property was purchased by her and her husband from the Shanghai Trust Company in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934). Luo Zhangqi's name is actually

her husband's alias. She gave the title deeds to Luo for safekeeping. Luo then took possession of them as her own. Because she was performing in a circus abroad, and after hearing of her husband's death, she rushed back to Shanghai in March of the 36th year of the Republic of China (1947), due to obstructed roads at the time. Luo had already registered the property in the name of Sun Yilian with the Land Administration Bureau. She raised an objection. At that time, Luo and Sun both agreed to change the registration to Sun Baoshi's name and signed a document. Unexpectedly, they suddenly reneged and also accused witnesses Yu Shanchang and Wang Jinzhen, to prevent fair statements, which is obviously a false accusation. She requests a clear judgment. The court held that the two sides held different views and could not agree, and decided to authenticate the handwriting as the basis for the judgment. It was announced that the trial would be rescheduled and both parties were advised that since they belonged to the same family, they should keep in mind the psychology that taking a loss is a benefit and not be too excessive.

### The Case of a Degenerate Son Assaulting His Father: Li Yihua Sentenced to Four Years

[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Yihua, who assaulted his father, Li Guozhi, was sentenced to four years of imprisonment by the District Court yesterday. It is reported that his father, Li Guozhi, runs the Tiancheng Teahouse on Jiaozhou Road. Although Yihua is an adult, he does not pursue an honest living and repeatedly demanded that his father entrust him with managing the Tiancheng business, so that he could spend extravagantly. His father refused. On the third of last month, he again used this as an excuse to propose severing the father-son relationship, demanding that his father hand over ten gold bars. When this was also not granted, Yihua gathered a group of hooligans to the shop and severely beat Guozhi, causing injuries. His younger brother, Yiyun, who tried to dissuade him, was also severely beaten. Guozhi then endured the pain and reported the incident to the police, who arrested and sent him to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. The sentence was pronounced as above.

### Payroll by Promissory Note Creates a Trend: Central Aviation Workers Demand Cash

[Report from Our Newspaper] Workers at the Central Aviation Corporation at Longhua Airport received their paychecks yesterday. The total amount of wages was approximately hundreds of millions of yuan. The company authorities, citing the recent cash shortage, issued crossed promissory notes to all workers. When the payments were made yesterday evening, the workers refused to accept them, arguing that using promissory notes would result in a discount and that crossed promissory notes had to be sent to the bank for clearing. They added that most of them do not have bank accounts. They expressed strong dissatisfaction with the company's measure and gathered at the airport to demand that they be paid in cash. Senior officials from the company's aviation group tried their best to persuade them, but the issue remained unresolved late into the night.

### The Northeastern Edge of Zhejiang (Part 1)

— Special Correspondent of Our Newspaper Chu Yusheng

[Report from Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 1st] The northeastern edge of Zhejiang Province includes ten counties: Wuxing, Changxing, Deqing, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Pinghu, Haiyan, Haining, Chongde, and Tongxiang. Within this area originate the East and West Tai Creeks, which originate from East and West Tianmu Mountains respectively. They flow through Wuxing, merge, and flow towards the two outlets of Daqian and Xiaomei, emptying into Tai Lake. There are also two canals: one is the Grand Canal, which runs from Wujiang in Jiangsu, south through Jiaxing to Hangzhou; the other is the Dongtang Canal, which runs from Wujiang to Wuxing. The branches of these canals connect in all directions, and the entire area has diverging ports and rivers. With its clear mountains, beautiful waters, and fertile land, it is a prosperous region of Jiangnan. It borders the East China Sea to the east, with a coastline extending westward from Haining and eastward through Haiyan to Quan Gongting in Pinghu, bordering Jinshanwei in Jinshan, Jiangsu. It was from this area that the Japanese enemies landed in 1937. It borders Tai Lake to the north, facing Wuxi in Jiangsu across the lake. The coastline extends westward from Fuziling in Changxing, bordering Yixing, and eastward to Hulu in Wuxing, bordering Wujiang in Jiangsu, with Daqian and Xiaomei in Wuxing being the largest gaps along the coast. The Taiping rebels landed here in the past and captured Wuxing. To the northwest lies the border region of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, starting from Fuziling in Changxing, passing through Xuanjiaoling and Xiangwangling, bordering Yixing in Jiangsu, and then from Baixianling, passing through Qingniuling, to Jiepai, bordering Guangde in Anhui. Further west are Anji and Xiaofeng. In October 1943, the Communist army entered the Baixian Coal Mountain and Cotton Hangkeng area from Yixing.

The Peaceful First District

On this northeastern edge of Zhejiang, there is undoubtedly the notoriously unstable Tai Lake, the complex border region of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the national border line bordering the East China Sea, so its position is quite important. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has designated it as the First District. Mr. Shuluan is the Administrative Inspector Commissioner, and Mr. Yu has been serving as the Commissioner in this area for ten years. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has also changed chairmen. Under Mr. Yu's administration, this area is indeed very peaceful. Recently, the southeastern and western regions of Zhejiang Province have been rather unstable. Even Lin'an, which this reporter left in April in a state of peace, has signs of unease. Only the northeastern border region remains quiet and peaceful, without any disturbances. This reporter once again took a special bus provided by the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Joint Operating Office for the press corps to the Wuxing area for on-the-spot investigation. I deeply feel that in Changxing, this border between Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, separated by only a mountain, is the area where the Communist army is active. Vast Tai Lake, and Dongshan and Xishan Islands within it, are also places where the Communist army frequently appears. However, this area has always maintained peace and tranquility. For example, in 1948, there were nine robbery cases in Wuxing and Jiaxing counties, four in Jiashan, two in Chongde, and three in Haiyan, totaling 27 cases for the year. No theft cases occurred in other counties, which can be considered a satisfactory state of peace.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Based on a tip, the Third Stationed Detachment of the Railway Police Section arrested more than ten habitual thieves in Room 21 of the Weiying Hotel at Qianwanli Bridge on the morning of the 31st. They were escorted to the City Defense Department for interrogation.

Wujin

[Report from Our Newspaper] Following the large-scale search at Houting Bridge on the border between Wujin and Danyang, the work of the First Joint Defense Zone of the Provincial Security Office continued, targeting the Anjiashe district along the Yangtze River in northern Wujin. At 3:00 AM on the 29th, Commander Zhang Da personally led the security police team, along with the chief of staff, the chief of the police局, and the head of the security regiment, departing from the city. By 5:30 AM, before dawn, the police and soldiers had reached the designated area. They suddenly and unexpectedly imposed a curfew, conducting searches village by village. They first captured accomplice Mei Jinfu in Meijia Village, Baishen Township. They arrested Principal Wu Xueli and others at the Dabatou National Elementary School in Xinqiao Township, and confiscated various propaganda materials in the school. In other villages, they arrested more than ten suspects, including Chen Zhenxin, Wan Xihai, Ding Huaqing, Yao Zailiang, Xu Lifang, Zhu Dalong, Wang Jinsheng, Zang Weisheng, Xu Fuda, and Song Fugen.

### To Alleviate the Degree of Cash Panic: National Banks Relax Withdrawal Limits: 60% Paid in Cash, 40% Paid in Promissory Notes

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the Central Bank issued 50,000-yuan fixed-amount promissory notes, it issued two more types of large bills yesterday, 5,000-yuan and 10,000-yuan, and also issued a 100,000-yuan promissory note to meet the salary needs of various circles. The withdrawal limit for banks and businesses was also increased again yesterday to 30% of the deposit balance, of which 60% was paid in cash and 40% was paid in promissory notes. After this relaxation, the authorities of the National Bank hope to slightly suppress the tight cash situation. According to a relevant official from the Business Bureau of the bank, the National Bank has now increased the withdrawal limit for banks and businesses to the highest amount. As a bank for banks, the National Bank is doing its best to solve the difficulties of banks. However, some banks, in addition to withdrawing their own limit of cash, also issue notes to their customers and bring them to the National Bank for cashing. The National Bank could have ignored this and instructed them to negotiate directly with the issuing bank, but in consideration of the situation, it still tries its best to cope with it. It is believed that the cash shortage phenomenon can be improved after recent remedial measures.

### Central Bank Sells Off Large Quantities: Gold Market Price Increase Slightly Suppressed

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the gold market was chaotic at the opening, because the Central Bank issued 5,000- and 10,000-yuan bills, and people were excited, shouting as high as 985,000, the price limit, with no supply to meet demand. Buying and selling were rejected for a long time. Until around 10:00 AM, the Central Bank entrusted Dadecheng Gold Shop to sell 2,629 large taels at 983,000, squeezing in 25.84 billion yuan, and people's hearts turned peaceful and buying was relieved.

Bank-related and securities-related parties came out one after another, opening at 975,000 and falling to 950,000.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the arbitrage of silver dollars was very active, and the price has risen sharply in recent days, far out of line with other places. The digestion of each gang has become sluggish, and there are rumors that the silver standard will be implemented soon, and the risk is quite large, so fewer people are willing to do it. All day long, only about 500,000 transactions were opened in South China and West China. Due to the active spending of retail investors, the market continued to rise on the road. The big heads shouted 17,000, 18,000 in the morning, and once rose to 17,500, 18,500. In the afternoon, it was slightly lower to 17,000, 18,000. The small heads shouted 14,000, 15,000. The Dragon Eagle Silver shouted 11,000, 12,000. The Qian-Dui gang and the cigarette paper gang did a firm exchange. In the morning, the big head's day-to-day check once rose to 20,000, 22,000. In the afternoon, it fell to 19,000, 21,000. The next-day interest rate was increased by 2,000, rising to 21,000, 23,000, an increase of 6,000 from the previous day.

### National Bank Tightens Money Supply: Secret Interest Rates as High as 120

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the money supply changed from loose to tight throughout the day. The daily拆 rate opened at 75 yuan per thousand yuan in the morning, but later rose to 90 yuan due to the National Bank's sale of gold and tightening of the money supply. In the afternoon, rumors of instability in some banks and businesses made money even tighter, with secret 拆 rates as high as 120 yuan per thousand yuan. The final daily 拆 rate was about 100 yuan. Yesterday, the National Bank sold a total of 24,000 taels of gold, squeezing out more than 20 billion yuan, which was the largest sale among the National Bank's repeated sales recently. The prices of financial commodities were hit by this and did not improve throughout the day. Yesterday, banks差出 a total of 16.5 billion, foreign banks差出 8 billion, large exchanges差進 5.1 billion, and small exchanges差進 12.2 billion.

### Food Rice Rises Madly: Early Rice as High as 125,000 Yuan

The food rice market was greatly stimulated by the issuance of large bills, and the cargo owners madly raised prices, creating an unprecedented sharp rise. The opening exhibition was 15,000, and then the cargo owners raised it again. The thin rice once sold for 125,000 yuan. The market closed and realized that the madness had risen excessively, and the cargo owners sold it, falling rapidly by 7,000 to 8,000. The market closed at 118,000 for the thin rice, which was still 25,000 more than yesterday, more than 25%. The market price of white梗 rice was 117,000 in the city, and the special 梗 rice was 123,000 yuan, and the price increased by more than 20,000 yuan across the board. A total of 3,813 shi arrived in the two markets.

Edible Oil

The upward surge restarted, and the cargo owners madly raised prices due to the issuance of large bills, and were even more affected by the skyrocketing rice prices, and people's hearts were extraordinarily firm. Soybean oil rose by 80,000, and rapeseed oil opened at 90,000, but then fell back by 30,000, for a total increase of 60,000. Raw oil also rose by 60,000. Only soybean cake rose slightly by 2,000 to 3,000 due to poor sales.

Flour

The rising trend has become even more intense. The issuance of large bills has stimulated people's hearts, and the price of rice has soared. The morning opening prices of all brands of flour broke through four levels. The closing price of old car flour was as high as 44,500 yuan. The warship Northern Gang納進 was still strong, and the market was rising step by step. The later market rose to 42,500 yuan, an increase of 20%. Bran sales were extremely smooth, and the price rose by more than 20%, with large packages selling for 36,500 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

The market situation was mixed. At the beginning of the market, all items rose together, and soybeans broke through the ten-thousand mark. Car beans once shouted as high as 110,000. In the later market, money was tight, and oil cake turned weak and fell back to 16,000, guarding the ten-thousand mark, which was still about 20% higher than before. Raw kernels and corn had very sluggish sales, and the market hovered. Mung beans rose by 20%, and red sorghum叩五關.

### Tung Oil Price Increase Resumes

Yesterday's tung oil market saw the resurgence of price increases. However, due to the weakness of domestic and foreign sales areas and the tight positions of colleagues, the magnitude has not expanded, and it has risen by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan compared with before.

### Taiwan Sugar Company: Selling Crude Sand

[Report from Our Newspaper] Taiwan Sugar Company opened for sale yesterday the 62nd phase of Taiwan Sugar's 200-jin crude sand. It was sold on behalf of the Central Bank. The price was set at 135,000 yuan per dan, and a total of 10,770 bags were allocated. The donation amount was increased to 15%.

### New Tea Priced in Rice

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to tea industry insiders: New tea from Zhejiang province is about to enter the market. Our city's businesses have already dispatched personnel to the production areas to investigate the new tea situation. We have just learned that this year, due to unfavorable weather, the harvest and production are inferior to previous years. However, tea farmers, feeling the alarming rise in commodity prices and the repeated depreciation of currency, are mostly considering pricing the tea in terms of rice. Generally, they are unwilling to sell 100 catties of new tea for less than about 10 shi (石， a unit of dry measure, approximately 100 liters) of white rice. If this measure becomes a reality, tea prices will undoubtedly skyrocket. However, whether actual sales will be smooth is difficult to predict, especially for export tea such as "Tun Green," where prices are currently inverted compared to foreign tea prices. Looking ahead, there is deep concern.

Yesterday, amidst various stimulating news, the tea market in our city was filled with empty shouts without any standard for the goods. The upward trend was difficult to restrain, and the ground was quite solid, but unfortunately, buying interest was very weak, and transactions were extremely narrow.

### Illegal Issuance of Bank Drafts by Commercial Banks: The Financial Supervisory Bureau Dispatches Investigators

[Our Newspaper's Report] Commercial bank drafts in our city are again flooding the market. To prevent abuses, the Financial Supervisory Bureau has dispatched investigators in batches. Bank drafts were originally issued in response to customer requests, and the face value is usually not fixed. The amount, date, and signature on the draft should be written in ink at the time of issuance. Since the autumn of last year, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated that all banks must deposit an amount equal to the outstanding balance of bank drafts issued each day into the Central Bank at the end of the business day, and must not over-issue them. Recently, a few banks have violated these regulations, arbitrarily issuing drafts, either not at the request of customers, or pre-printing fixed-amount drafts with seals, or failing to deposit sufficient funds into the Central Bank to cover the outstanding balance of drafts issued that day. All of these are illegal. It is reported that the authorities are investigating and prosecuting these cases and have reiterated previous orders, instructing the Shanghai Banking, Money Exchange, and Trust Trade Association to quickly relay the instructions to all banks and trust companies for compliance. Any further violations will be severely punished upon verification. As for the fixed-amount bank drafts recently issued by the Central Bank to adjust the circulation of banknotes according to actual needs, they are regarded as legal tender. No other bank or money exchange is allowed to imitate their issuance.

### Committee for Loan Disbursement to Industries and Mines Approves Nine Loan Applications

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Industrial and Mining Advisory Committee of the Central Bank's Discount and Loan Committee held its 36th regular meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Cai Gongchun. Nine loan applications were approved and will be submitted to the next Discount and Loan Committee meeting for approval.

### Market Stroll

— Platform Spectator

Central Bank Uses Brains on April Fool's Day: The American Loan Bank Was Just a Joke

Yesterday was April Fool's Day. According to custom, it's okay to fool people; not fooling people isn't modern. So, jokes abounded.

Amidst the wild fluctuations of the silver dollar ("Yuan Tou", a nickname for silver dollars), the Central Bank also had some fun. The bank's press office publicly announced to reporters that the Washington Telegraph reported that the American silver loan to China had been successfully negotiated.

This news spread to the market. People panicked, and the silver dollar took the brunt, falling sharply at one point. But it was soon seen through, and it rebounded strongly, with an even more intense reaction.

The harmful bank drafts became uglier yesterday.

On Sichuan Road and Jiangxi Road, silver dollar dealers were holding stacks of bank drafts, shouting, "Want Central Bank drafts? 10,000 for 9,000!"

The reporter passed these two roads on business and was approached by people peddling Central Bank drafts more than ten times. They all said as they left, "No one wants them after hawking them around."

It is said that starting next week, national banks will have the exclusive right to issue bank drafts and will no longer allow commercial banks to issue them.

If this is true, the World Bank Law and the Negotiable Instruments Law will have been re-amended. But in reality, it is probably not true. Because the purpose of banks issuing drafts is to substitute for cash. If banks are not allowed to issue drafts, unless the Central Bank fully supplies cash funds and provides police protection for every customer withdrawing cash. The reason why customers request banks to issue drafts when withdrawing large amounts is to avoid the risks of transporting cash. If banks are not allowed to issue drafts, banks will have to pay in cash. Then, the customer's risk of transporting cash should be borne by the Central Bank.

Tight Credit Causes Banks to Waver: Be Cautious in This Big Picture

The tight credit situation is increasing.

However, banks still had a massive difference of more than 10 billion yesterday. This shows the large capacity and broad scope of the market's appetite.

News of banks wavering was even more alarming yesterday. It is said that there are more than 20 banks, all with clearly identifiable names, including some with long histories.

Unless the cash shortage is resolved and the abuse of negotiable instruments is eliminated, the danger to banks is just beginning! Because customers want to quickly pay out the negotiable instruments they receive, without having to deposit them. Because depositing them is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive, but also incurs a day's interest.

Speaking of losing interest, the blame should be placed on the ban on cashing negotiable instruments on the same day. But it is also the banks taking the opportunity to exploit the situation and greedily profiting from one day's interest. So, it's another case of shooting oneself in the foot.

Today's news is not enough to change the market. But be very careful! The market may have major upheaval in the coming days.

But among all the changes, gold, cash, silver dollars, rice, and coal will not be bad; everything else is risky. The most likely risk is stocks.

Yesterday and today are good opportunities for the stock market to emerge.

### Short Sellers Eagerly Cover: Chinese Stocks Become Lively at Close

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the Chinese stock market, the morning was sluggish due to the tightening of interbank lending by commercial banks. News that the Central Bank would massively sell gold, silver, and materials caused much concern. Although factors such as the issuance of large-denomination bank drafts and the lower interbank lending rate outside the market were positive, the market sentiment remained in a state of consolidation due to high implicit interest rates and heavy pressure from short sellers. Yung Spinning opened at 12 yuan. Old positions sold off frequently, falling to 11.30 yuan and 11.35 yuan. Gold Yarn traders continuously bought up, pushing the price back up to a new high of 12.60 yuan. Later, as gold prices declined and the credit crunch intensified, various traders started selling, and the price fell back to 11.90 yuan by the afternoon close.

Small and medium-sized stocks opened steadily in the morning, with significant fluctuations in between. They all stabilized at the close. New Light initially opened at 1.12 yuan, briefly surging to 1.25 yuan. After briefly seeing 1.06 yuan, it was strongly supported by behind-the-scenes buying near noon, finally closing high at 1.20 yuan. Mei Ya initially opened at 3.80 yuan, reaching a high of 3.90 yuan, before plunging to 3.35 yuan, and closing at 3.65 yuan in the afternoon. Jingfu, Jinglun, Qinxing, and Xinyi opened weakly and remained weak throughout the day. They briefly rose in the middle of the day but softened again at the close, resulting in a slight squeeze upwards. The remaining stocks showed mixed gains and losses.

After the Central Bank sold gold in the afternoon, the credit situation became tighter than in the morning. Opening prices initially declined, but short covering before the close boosted buying interest, and Yung Spinning rose to the daily limit at closing. Most other stocks rose to the daily limit. Except for New Asia, which fell by 0.32 yuan, most miscellaneous stocks rose by about 20%. The total transaction volume for the day was 4.8214 billion shares.

The over-the-counter foreign stock market was still strong yesterday. Opening prices for all stocks were brisk in the morning. Yi Spinning traded at 30,000 yuan and 32,000 yuan. British Union traded at 35,000 yuan and 37,000 yuan, up 3,000 yuan. Ye Guang traded at 9,500 yuan and 10,000 yuan, up 1,000 yuan. Asia traded at 3,300 yuan and 3,400 yuan. Wheelock traded at 110,000 yuan and 115,000 yuan, up 10,000 yuan. The remaining stocks were also favorable.

Gold Bonds opened in the morning with bids at 550,000 yuan, rising all the way to 650,000 yuan, closing at 590,000 yuan in the afternoon, but there were no transactions. There were no transactions in the afternoon market.

### Yarn Prices Slightly Recover at Close: Cotton Cloth Initially Firm, then Declines

Yesterday, cotton yarn continued to be strong. The tight credit situation in the industry persisted, and most buyers remained in a wait-and-see attitude. There was no large-scale trading on the street. All yarns initially showed high prices in the morning. Near noon, many sellers who needed cash tried to dispose of their holdings, and prices slightly declined at the close.

42-count Blue Phoenix initially opened as high as 7.12 million yuan, but eventually closed at 6.92 million yuan, still up 520,000 yuan from the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose 550,000 yuan, and 32-count Silver Moon squeezed up 330,000 yuan.

21-count Double Horse spot opened at 3.48 million yuan, briefly rising to 3.50 million yuan, before briefly falling to 3.41 million yuan before the close, and finally settling at 3.44 million yuan, up 200,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse finally traded at 3.31 million yuan, up 240,000 yuan. Grades of 16-count and below also showed slight gains.

The cloth market rose sharply and then fell quickly. Initially, it carried over the over-the-counter gains from the previous day, and everyone was bullish. Buyers absorbed eagerly, but upon hearing news of gold price declines near the close, holders became psychologically fearful and rushed to sell, causing the market to turn sharply downward. As a result, it still saw gains compared to the afternoon close of the previous day.

Dragon Head Fine Cloth initially opened at 162,000 yuan, briefly reaching 163,000 yuan, and then falling from that high, finally trading at 145,000 yuan, a squeeze upwards of 14,000 yuan. Five Blessings Fine Cloth rose 11,000 yuan, ending at 124,000 yuan.

Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji opened at 145,000 yuan in the morning. As many sellers took advantage of the high prices, the price gradually declined, and the afternoon close was 128,000 yuan, a final increase of 13,500 yuan. Because dyes and fuels are soaring in price, top-grade Shilin cloth and other colored cloths were raised to as high as 338,000 yuan yesterday.

### Central Textiles Sells Yarn

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Central Bank continued to entrust the Textile Construction Company to sell yarn yesterday. A total of 395 pieces were sold, worth 120.475 million yuan.

### Football Talk for Today and Tomorrow

— Da He

It's the weekend again, and football fans are going to the Racecourse. Although Shanghai's football scene is now divided into three camps, the foreigner's matches inside the Racecourse have a "No Loitering" sign, making it impossible for ordinary people to enter. In the South Market, Saturdays and Sundays are "holidays." So, when talking about football on the weekend, let's talk about the battles at the Racecourse.

On Saturday afternoon, the match at the Racecourse starts at 1:01 PM. The Youth Cup will feature the Firefly team against the Rock team. These two teams are rising elites, young and strong, like the new waves in the Yangtze River.

At 3:30 PM, Zhonghang will play against Zhichao. This match has potential. Looking at the records, Zhonghang won the first round 1-0. Zhichao will definitely seek revenge this time.

However, Zhonghang has been in high spirits recently. In the Mayor's Cup, they eliminated Qingbai 2-1, the first team to break Qingbai's long-standing winning streak in three years. This is truly the ultimate glory for Zhonghang. Although they lost in the final, any fan has the thought that "this is a chance created by Zhonghang." Therefore, although Zhichao is determined and has the will, winning the game is a big problem.

Zhichao relies on Wu Qixiang as the soul of the team's offense and defense, but Qixiang has recently lost interest in playing football due to some issues. His appearance in this match is a matter of concern.

Zhonghang's defense is not strong. In fact, inside, there is only Xu Fusheng as a reliable goalkeeper. The defense line also only has Xie Xichuan holding it together. The center defense line is even weaker. Jin Chuanhan can still be used, but the other two are not very reliable.

Zhichao's offense, the problem is how to breach Fusheng. If Fusheng is protected by Xie Xichuan and Jin Chuanhan, Zhichao's forwards will not have the ability to shoot from 20 yards away. Zhonghang can be as stable as Mount Tai.

Therefore, Zhichao's attack should use both wings more. The right wing's attack should go straight down the side, luring out Xie Xichuan, and then passing into the center. The best method is of course a long pass to the left wing, but they probably don't have the skills to do so.

If the right wing can draw Little Xie away from the goal, there will be an opportunity to break through in the center. The left wing should cut in and shoot rather than cross, because if the cross is high, it will be difficult to get past Little Xie.

If Zhonghang wants to break through Zhichao's defense, the first thing is to find a way to get past Wu Qixiang, but that is quite difficult.

Jingwu once defeated Zhichao, and the methods they used are worth Zhonghang borrowing.

That method is: the center forward retreats slightly, then the wings cut in, and the two inside forwards advance together. This method is especially effective against central defenders who are good at protecting the goal. Because if the center forward retreats, if the central defender comes out, then the meaning of the third defender is lost, and the wings have the possibility of driving straight down. If the central defender is still inside, then the two inside forwards can use the attack method of interchanging positions, making it difficult for the central defender to guard them one against two.

In this match, Zhonghang should have Xu Zuguo play winger and Gao Xiuqing play a retreating center forward. If they can arrange the lineup this way, they can beat Zhichao again.

On Sunday, Qingbai will play against Longtou at 3:30 PM.

This game should be one of the major matches, and a fierce battle is expected.

After Qingbai had bad luck in the Mayor's Cup, the paper tiger was exposed. Ah Fu did not come out to lead the troops, causing Qingbai's lineup to lose its attacking power. It will not be easy to win against the strong Longtou from the north.

In fact, to deal with Qingbai, the first thing is to pin down Little Luo. Little Luo is the root of the blood vessels and also a shooter. Among the teams in Shanghai, there is no inside forward who can compare with Little Luo. However, this is Qingbai's strength, and exposing it is also a weakness. If Little Luo is controlled, Qingbai's forwards will have little chance.

Jin Lusheng's darting shots are certainly formidable, but if Little Luo doesn't find gaps to open the way, it's also futile.

Qingbai's right-wing offense is not strong. If you keep a close eye on the left, the right will not have problems.

The second thing to win against Qingbai is to attack the weak points of Qingbai's defense. There is Meng Yiliang in the center. Old Meng is very skilled at guarding the goal. If you put pressure on this point, it will definitely be more effective. Sanmao's side is also extremely stable in defense. However, Xue Peiran likes to go out and assist the attack. If a fast enough inside forward partners with the left wing in time, there is also a possibility of getting past Sanmao. The left side is the weaker link in Qingbai's defense. Qian Changrong is not in good form, and Zhang Renyi is not a talented defender. There is an opportunity to take advantage of either of these two guarding the goal.

But Qingbai's strength is in the center defense line. Xue Peiran and Fu Naitang will both control the midfield. Longtou must gain an advantage in the midfield in order to have the ability to defeat Qingbai. Otherwise, if Peiran is allowed to bring the ball out and Little Luo can be active, Longtou's defense will be exposed.

### Renyu's Last Lesson: Tonight's Battle Against the Shanghai Police. Women's Match: Li Team vs. Li Team

The four-session basketball league's Group A1 has reached its final stage. There are five more games to be played and will be all over on April 8. The Hualian team winning the championship again is no problem. Renyu has the highest hopes of winning the second place, and the match against the Shanghai Police tonight is also quite important. Before the main event, there will be a Women's match and a Group A2 match, starting at 5:30 PM. Ticket prices have been adjusted to 1,500 yuan for the upper deck, 3,000 yuan for the lower deck, and 5,000 yuan for reserved seats. The order and referees are listed as follows:

Li Team - Li Team (Women's Group) 5:30 PM

Referees: Wang Yiqiao, Zhu Mingxing

Mei Qixiang - Jianle (Group A2 C) 6:15 PM Referees: Wen Zongyuan, Huang Cunrui

Renyu - Shanghai Police (Group A1) 7:15 PM

Referees: Wu Zibin, Liu Hesheng

There are two Women's games left. Today is the re-encounter of the Li team and the Li team. The Li team has risen in this session. The women's team is getting stronger in every fight. Today, it should be able to defeat the Li team again and win the second place. The Li team has no hope of victory, and the fourth place is non-other than theirs. However, the tireless fighting spirit of the new players is worthy of commendation and they will definitely resist to the end.

Group A2 C, Mei Qixiang vs. Jianle, is the main battle of this group. Mei Qixiang has always won. Jianle has won every game except for losing to the Fat team. If they can defeat the Western forces in one go, they may have a chance to win the championship. However, Mei Qixiang's main player, Bo Tou, has transferred to Enkas, and their strength is still considerable. The Jianle players should be cautious and use all their wisdom to strive for victory.

Group A1 Renyu vs. Shanghai Police, Renyu is their last lesson. The team recently defeated Haiqing greatly, fully demonstrating their power. Xu Zhonglv, Wu Xinyun, Shen Pengju, Yao Weny, and others all have unique skills, and the team's record is nine wins and four losses, making them the highest contender for second place. If they defeat the Shanghai Police tonight, it will become an unshakeable fact and their second-place finish cannot be shaken.

The Shanghai Police have six wins and five losses, with three games left. Although they are not significant, they are very relevant to their ranking. If they win tonight's battle, they still have a glimmer of hope for second place, otherwise, they may not even be able to keep the third place. Therefore, the whole team must go all out and fight to the death. Moreover, the Shanghai Police had a strong momentum in the first round, but they were discouraged by Renyu's fierce attack. This time, they are seeking revenge, and the two sides are evenly matched, and a fierce battle is inevitable. The names of the six teams are as follows:

(Li Team) Qian Chuping, Qian Youping, Zeng Zhaoqing, Zhu Cuidi, Niu Yunjuan, Yao Silian, Xu Huiru, Chen Wenyan, Cai Mingxia, Chen Yuling, Guo Yipei, Xu Muben, Jin Lili.

(Li Team) Weng Xiayun, Wang Jiahua, Liang Miaoling, Yao Wenda, Liang Miaozhen, Fan Yuying, Chen Shanbao, Liu Danzai, Zhang Shanfu, Zhou Younan.

(Mei Qixiang) Pu Bo, Lai Fudan, Mankao, Ke Linsi, Lao Xu, Kai Pu, Shi Gailai.

(Jianle) Chen Yong'an, Zhang Xianlun, Zhou Jun, Wang Minzhi, Yan Shilu, Chen Zuoliang, Yu Kun, Wang Zhengqing, Xuan Tong, Tian Binggang.

(Renyu) Chen Wei Yuan, Wu Xin Yun, Yao Wen Yi, Zhuang Yi Rong, Shen Peng Ju, Li Zhao He, Wang Huai Ting, Cai Jin Dian, Sun Guo Zheng, Xu Zhong Yi, Yan Bin.

(Shanghai Police) He Jingui, He Zeng, Wang Bowen, Sun Moses, Fu Qixia, Liang Rongbiao, Wang Rongsheng, Shi Wenquan, Chen Shensi.

### Basketball Friendly Match: Basketball Committee and Modern World

The Basketball Committee and the Modern World basketball team had a friendly match at the gymnasium at 6:30 PM yesterday. Xuan Zhijie and Kong Guangyi were the referees. Chen Weiyuan, Zhou Jun, Chen Yong'an, Xie Yiqin, and Wen Zongyuan played for the Basketball Committee. Wang Weijun, Xia Zhiong, Liu Ronggen, Gong Shiyin, and Qu Xirong played for the Modern World. The first half ended with a score of 32 to 19, with the Modern World in the lead. After switching sides, Qian Xucang of the Basketball Committee came on, and the situation changed dramatically. They quickly caught up to 44 to 43, and then exceeded with 50 to 44. In conclusion, the Basketball Committee shook hands with Modern World with a score of 54 to 54 in the end.

### World Table Tennis Room Opens: Exhibition Matches Full of Excitement

The World Table Tennis Room held its opening ceremony at the fourth floor of the Great World at 3:00 PM yesterday and invited famous male and female players in the city to participate in the exhibition to add to the excitement. More than 600 spectators were present, making it a grand occasion for a time. The ceremony began with Chen Linsheng unveiling the opening and Wang Yi giving a speech. The exhibition then began, with a total of five groups playing. The battles were full of excitement, winning thunderous applause from the audience. In the first group, up-and-coming young player Wang Chuanyao faced Sun Meiying, the runner-up in the women's singles at the National Games. He was weaker and lost to her by a score of one to two. In the second group, chopper Gu Hehua defeated Qi Wenyuan in straight sets. In the third group, ball freak Zhu Qingji defeated Dong Wenshao, a strong player from Nanjing, with short blocks. In the fourth group, all-around player Liu Zaoshi had a fierce battle with popper Zhuang Kunrong. Zaoshi was agile, while Kunle was fat and tired of running. Liu won by a score of one to two. In the last group, Shanghai women's champion Cai Xiuyu faced veteran Chen Linsheng. The battle was quite intense. Cai swung her paddle and attacked fiercely, with extremely accurate angles. Old Chen always defended and did not exert his full strength. As a result, Cai won by a score of two to one.

### Longtou Barely Defeats Daxia: Score Two to One. Both Sides Perform Excellently

The Longtou football team relied on their efforts in the last five minutes to narrowly defeat Daxia two to one in the Democratic Cup yesterday. Longtou's skills and strength are well known, and need no introduction. Daxia is a newly promoted youth team, and their performance yesterday was very satisfying. Goalkeeper Shen Yanguan was extraordinary, and defenders Chen Fulai and Shao Guangming were as solid as iron gates. The midfielders were also very solid and able to create attacking opportunities for the forwards. In particular, the intercepting and passing skills of the central midfielders Yu Lishen and Huang Zengxi were outstanding. However, the two wings of the forward line were relatively weak, and center forward Pang Meixiong often hesitated and missed opportunities, which was a shortcoming. However, in any case, Daxia is a team with a very good foundation. If they can reduce their dribbling, they have limitless potential.

In the first half, although Longtou had many attacks, Daxia's defenders and goalkeeper were able to defuse the danger one by one. After a fierce battle of three quarters of an hour, no goals were scored. After switching sides, the competition became even more intense, and the game became even more exciting. After about half an hour of stalemate, Zhang Jiliang of Longtou scored the first goal, but soon Pang Meixiong of Daxia equalized to one goal each. Longtou continued their efforts, and until three minutes before the end of the game, Jiang Kun finally shot the ball into the net in the chaos, winning the final victory by two to one. The starting lineups for both sides are as follows:

Longtou

Yan Chengkuan

Li Chengxian Yao Qingsheng

Wu Kaimin Wang Baoshan Shi Da Fa

Zhang Jingen Jiang Kun Zhang Jiliang Wang Burong Chen Qin

Daxia

Shen Yanguan

Shao Guangming Chen Fulai

Huang Zengxi Yu Lishen Ji Husheng

Ye Chenglong Yang Tingjian Hu Zhishui Pang Meixiong Chen Yifei Lv Weicheng

The schedule for the second week of the Democratic Cup football tournament has been arranged as follows:

Jiuzhou vs. Daxia, Tuesday, May 2nd

Samsung vs. Rock Team, Wednesday, May 3rd

### Football League Second Round: China Aviation vs. Zhi Chao - A Rematch Today

The second round of the Division A Football League features China Aviation against Zhi Chao. The match is scheduled for 3:30 PM today at the Recreation Ground. Prior to that, at 1:15 PM, there will be a Junior Cup semi-final match between the Pan team and the Fluorescent team, vying for a spot in the final. Ticket prices have been adjusted to two tiers: $2,000 and $3,500, and will be available for sale at the Recreation Ground entrance starting at 12:30 PM. It is reported that ten teams participated in the Junior Cup. In the semi-finals, the leading Dragon Head team defeated Li Ma with a score of four to one, securing their place in the final. Furthermore, the match between the Pan team and the Fluorescent team has been postponed repeatedly and is now scheduled to take place this afternoon. Both teams possess considerable strength, leaving the outcome uncertain.

In the Division A League match between China Aviation and Zhi Chao, the referee will be Ni Xiaoben, with Chen Daohong and Zhang Zhiren as linesmen. In the first round, China Aviation narrowly won with a score of one to zero. Moreover, in the Mayor's Cup, although the team did not ultimately win the championship, they did defeat Qingbai Jindar in the semi-final stage, which is quite commendable. The lineup for today's match has been finalized. Xie Xichuan has been repositioned as a midfielder, with Yang Baoluo filling his previous position. The central defense line, in addition to Jin Jiabiao and Jin Chuanhan, will be strengthened by the addition of Xie, making it even more formidable. The forward line will be led by Gao Xiuqing, supported by a group of energetic young players such as Yin Qingbing, Xu Zuguo, Li Shunsheng, and Quan Simin, promising a strong offensive showing.

The Zhi Chao team, a newcomer this season, has had a mediocre record in the League A. However, they also eliminated the Dragon Head team in the Mayor's Cup, creating considerable momentum. Under the leadership of veteran Wu Qixiang, their ball skills are remarkably impressive, and they are sure to pose a threat to China Aviation today. However, avenging their previous defeat will likely be a difficult task. The order and list of players are as follows:

China Aviation

Xu Fusheng

Yang Baoluo, Fang Shansui

Xie Xichuan, Jin Chuanhan, Jin Jiabiao, Shang Huajun

Wang Guoguang, Xu Zuguo, Gao Xiuqing, Yin Qingbing, Li Shunsheng, Zheng Simin

Zhi Chao

Gan Huizhong, Zhang Delong, Sheng Peter

Hua Shoujiang, Lu Yide, Le Dequan

Wang Keren, Lü Qitang, Wu Qixiang, Zhu Chengjiu, Yu Qiaxing

Zhu Jiazheng, Xu Guoping, Jiang Xiegeng, Zhang Yaoqin, Qian Yunqing, Guan Yongchang, Wu Zheming

### Ping Pong Knowledge

— Written by Wang Xin Jing, Edited by Chen Linsheng (4)

Choosing a Ping Pong Paddle: The ping pong paddle is the most important tool for playing ping pong, and the only tool. Therefore, the selection of a ping pong paddle should be given careful consideration.

The ping pong paddles we used as children had small, round holes about the size of yellow beans in the middle, ranging from as many as twenty or thirty to as few as a dozen. The arrangement of these holes was very inconsistent. These paddles were mostly made of cedar wood, which is lightweight but lacks elasticity. Nowadays, because the holes in the paddle are both meaningless and unsightly, they are being phased out.

In the past, most ping pong paddles were made of plywood because plywood is made by gluing together several thin layers of wood with the grain running in different directions, so it is less affected by the weather. Better quality ping pong paddles are made of paulownia or Philippine mahogany. These woods are softer and more elastic. Some even use cork for the handle, making the paddle very comfortable to hold. Ping pong paddles for hard balls have a rubber surface with studs on one side. The styles of paddles vary greatly. The most popular paddle in the past was oval-shaped with a flat handle; nowadays, round handles resembling hot water bottles are more common. The size, shape, and materials used for the paddle are all up to personal preference and are not restricted by ping pong rules.

Which type is more convenient depends on personal preference, but in my opinion, the paddle should be lightweight and elastic, and being excessively large is not beneficial.

Linsheng's note: Since the introduction of hard ball competitions in this city from the 35th year of the Republic, most players have switched to using rubber paddles. Wooden paddles have also been largely phased out. However, due to economic reasons, wooden paddles are still used by many primary and secondary school students.

(2) The History of Ping Pong in China

The success of any endeavor depends on continuously identifying shortcomings, gradually improving, and ultimately achieving a more perfect state.

Ping pong is no exception.

Ping pong was invented based on the principles of tennis. At the time, there were no fixed standards for the size, weight, color, or hardness of the ball. These were gradually improved until a standard was established. However, due to individual preferences, ping pong balls were broadly divided into soft balls and hard balls. Ten years ago, soft balls were popular in both China and Japan. Because international ping pong competitions now use hard balls, the Chinese ping pong community has been making great efforts to promote hard balls in the past five or six years. Unfortunately, there are too few outstanding talents. If we want to occupy a place on the world ping pong stage in the future, we must pay special attention to hard ball techniques.

In the past, China relied entirely on foreign countries for its ping pong balls. At that time, ping pong was not yet well-developed, and the sales of balls were limited, resulting in little loss. After China and Japan signed an agreement for international competitions in the 12th year of the Republic, ping pong became increasingly popular, and the sales of ping pong balls gradually increased. At the same time, the outflow of money also increased day by day. We are undoubtedly very pleased with the development of ping pong, but we must strive to reverse the outflow of money.

In the 15th year of the Republic, the China Ping Pong Company, with the aim of recovering rights and promoting ping pong, diligently researched and developed the Lianhuan brand of standard ping pong balls. Of course, to promote ping pong, we must be able to manufacture our own ping pong equipment; otherwise, promoting ping pong is tantamount to promoting sales for foreigners. The more ping pong develops, the more money will flow out. I remember a slogan in the China Ping Pong Research Association: "Play ping pong with foreign balls, good for the body, bad for the country." Upon careful consideration, this is indeed true. Therefore, the success of the China Ping Pong Company is a great contribution to the Chinese ping pong community. According to ping pong rules, the weight and circumference of a hard ball are:

(A) Weight: 2.40 cm to 2.53 cm;

(B) Circumference: 3.79 cm (1.5 inches).

### Raising Hands

— Bao Zhongqi

Recently, I attended a public lecture that moved me deeply.

The speaker started by asking a question: "Among your relatives and friends, who has died in recent years due to direct or indirect harm from the war? Please raise your hand." Indeed, some people raised their hands, but in such a large lecture hall, there were only a dozen or so hands.

Then, he asked the second question: "Among your relatives and friends, who has died in recent years due to tuberculosis? Please raise your hand." This time, almost 50% or more of the hands went up.

The topic of this lecture was "Tuberculosis Prevention." In just a few tens of minutes, it can be said that the audience was moved. The deepest impression I got was the scene of many hands raised, because it reminded me of another similar scene, which I saw in a German propaganda film during the war: countless French people gathered in a square, shouting "Heil Hitler!"

Although I was very skeptical, that's exactly what was shown on the screen.

Finally, I inadvertently found the answer in a magazine. It was after the German army occupied a large French city that they gathered the local people. An officer asked through a microphone: "Please raise your hand if you don't understand German."

All the hands went up, and the camera captured every single one. It was also a great scene of raising hands, but there were these differences. It can be seen that things in the world are really difficult to judge!

### Different Customs in Different Places

— Sang

Some landlords in Paris stipulate in their leases that each tenant is allowed to hold one loud and boisterous party per month. At this party, any game, even boxing, is allowed until eight o'clock the next morning. Other tenants must not interfere. However, one day before holding the gathering, the tenant must give written notice to the landlord so that the landlord has enough time to warn other tenants to temporarily move out or make other preparations for the evening.

In Sweden, when housewives host grand banquets, they often make a table of the arranged seating and paste it at the entrance so that guests with poor memories can "follow the map" without being impolite to others, even if they have forgotten other guests' names after introductions.

When the King of Siam punished his courtiers, he often gave them a white elephant. Because Siam is known as the "Land of the White Elephant," the white elephant is regarded as sacred and inviolable. The cost of supporting it often bankrupts the courtier.

If Egyptian women are over forty years old, they wear a black traditional costume, and the entire head, except for a pair of eyes, is completely wrapped in a black veil.

### Men and Women

— Translated by Li

When God created women, he did not create them from the skull of men, nor from the bones of their feet, but from their ribs. Therefore, today women are neither the masters of men nor their slaves, but have become "the ones closest to their hearts."

### Black Bears of North America

— Fang Zhou

We Chinese often say "as strong as an ox," the French like to say "as strong as a donkey," while the British and Americans prefer to say "as strong as a bear." In fact, the strength of a bear is indeed ten times greater than that of oxen and donkeys. It is said that if a bear strikes with its paw, the heads of oxen and donkeys can be smashed to pieces.

The forests of Alaska, Allison La, and Florida in North America are active areas for bears. Their fur is mostly black, with a few being cinnamon, coffee, or light brown. Regardless of the color, North American residents call them "black bears."

Black bears can weigh up to four hundred pounds and stand three feet tall. They can stand upright like humans, at which time their height is six feet. In short distances, they can travel thirty miles per hour. Speaking of their strength, they can be said to be unmatched among animals except for elephants. They can pull three hundred pounds of wood and uproot twenty-foot-tall oak trees. Once, a black bear in Florida grabbed a one hundred and fifty-pound pig with its forefoot and ran nearly a mile before abandoning its prey when farmers chased after it in groups.

Black bears eat everything: fruits, roots, insects, fish, and any animal they can catch. They especially like to eat honey and ants. Telephone lines are often damaged by them because they mistake the "buzzing" sound of the telephone lines for bees, so they often climb up telephone poles and tear down the wires. Speaking of the black bear's ability to climb trees, it is a skill they have trained since childhood. A cub less than three months old likes to climb low trees, and only jumps to the ground when the branch droops under its weight. Black bears are also quite clever at catching ants. They dig out ant nests, extend their forefoot, and let angry ants crawl all over it before licking it clean.

Every year from November to April, is the "hibernation" period for black bears. During this time, they hibernate in rock caves or large tree holes, without eating or moving, and their heart rate and breathing become particularly slow. Female bears give birth during this period, producing two or three cubs per litter, each weighing less than one pound, blind and hairless, and only able to leave the cave to play after a month of hibernation. "Hibernation" is a resting period for black bears, but it is also a period of misfortune for them, because hunters often use this time to catch them, and they have no choice but to submit.

Many black bears are kept in American national parks, and they are very tame. It is said that they love to have their picture taken. When tourists raise their cameras, they will pose in the most beautiful and majestic poses, allowing tourists to capture them in the lens.

### Epic Poetry of the Late Ming Dynasty

— Fan Shouwu

In this chaotic world, it is easiest to evoke people's thoughts of historical relics. On a cold spring night, under the flickering light of a lamp, I happened to think of Huang Chunyao, a heroic warrior of the late Ming Dynasty, and the three poems he wrote on the theme of "Wild Man."

Chunyao, styled Yunsheng, was from Jiading in the Ming Dynasty. He was a Jinshi graduate in the Guiwei year of Chongzhen (Guiwei is the sixteenth year of Chongzhen, when Li Zicheng captured Beijing and the emperor hanged himself). At that time, the bandits were rampant, the politics of the court were corrupt, there was famine in the world, and the people were filled with resentment. Chunyao was heartbroken by what he saw, resigned and returned to his hometown, organized a local militia, and called on the people of his hometown to prepare to protect the country and their villages. Unfortunately, the general trend was gone, and it was impossible to prop up the crumbling building with one hand. Therefore, he could only express his sorrow for the times and his feelings in poetry. The "Wild Man" poems, which have been passed down for thousands of years, are the product of this kind of emotion. The poems say:

The wild man sighs at the hardship of the royal army, the Qin bandits and Chu bandits are like hedgehog hairs, they attack cities and plunder the countryside, officials die, and the people north of the Yangtze River wail. Yesterday I heard that dead thieves robbed wealth and distributed it to the officers as bribes, chopped off the heads of the people and hung them on tall trees, and when dawn came, the thieves were gone.

The wild man sighs at the bad year, digging wells in the ponds, and the bottom of the wells are dry, locusts lead their young to cover the sky, and it is useless to squander one's family's wealth on farming. The court adds levies from time to time, and complaining to the officials only earns a shake of the head, meeting the clerks on a narrow road, soft fur coats, fast horses, demanding money.

The wild man sighs that there is no one in the court, and the Ming Party in the court is like fish scales, ten officials are summoned, and nine remain silent, crawling and barely accommodating themselves. Who in the court manages yin and yang, frequent solar eclipses in recent years have devastated the four seas, I want to write a letter to ask the courtiers, but I am afraid that people will rebuke me as a foolish man.

The original poems can be found in the "Ming Poetry Collection," selected by Shen Deqian, who commented after the poems: "The general situation of the court and the countryside is such that even if one wants not to perish, how can it be possible?" History is a ruthless mirror, and the words in the poems are still worthy of our vigilance three hundred years later.

### On Cannibalism

— Qian Dacheng

In ancient times, it was customary for people to eat people. The Spring and Autumn Annals of Zuo even mentioned the phrase "eat flesh and sleep on skin," which may have been an exaggeration by Zuo Qiuming? However, there are indeed many historical records of cannibalism. Even children know about Ma Shumou eating people. After a group of loyal ministers and filial sons personally killed their enemies, they would routinely eat their flesh raw. Not only would people not say they were barbaric, but they would praise their loyalty and filial piety? It is said that even now, some savage tribes eat their parents as a sign of filial piety. In short, whether eating enemies or eating parents, eating people is always considered a form of filial piety, no wonder Lu Xun said that the entire history is just two big words: "cannibalism," but this literary advocate of hatred only knew that cannibalism was malicious, but I know that cannibalism also has good intentions. Cannibalism is detestable, but sometimes it can also be commendable.

There are many ways to eat people, but the most wonderful is the following record in the "Chicken Rib Compilation":

"In the early Tang Dynasty, the bandit Zhu Can used people as food, saying that eating drunk people was like eating pickled pork. ... And since the year of Bingwu in the Jingkang era (of the Song Dynasty), when the Jin barbarians invaded China, ... bandits, soldiers, and even residents ate each other, and the price of meat was cheaper than dogs and pigs ... old and thin men were called "burning fire," young and beautiful women were called "enviable sheep," and children were called "rotting with bones," and they were all commonly called "two-legged sheep." ..."

Please don't say they are cruel, they are based on scripture. Didn't the Zuo Zhuan say? "It's like birds and beasts, the ministers eat their flesh and sleep on their skin!" They are not eating people, they are eating birds and beasts!

I have never eaten human flesh, because I am not a loyal minister or filial son, nor am I a savage. But a retired military officer once told me that he had eaten human heart and liver. It is said that the taste is similar to pig liver; at first, he didn't know he was eating human flesh, so he ate it with relish, but after he found out, he vomited, and people scolded him for being too timid, saying that he was not worthy to eat human flesh. When I met him, he was in dire straits, and perhaps his lack of success in life was because he couldn't get used to eating human flesh?

Since ancient times, filial sons and daughters have cut flesh from their thighs to cure their parents' illnesses, which is an evolution of the way of eating human flesh and can be considered a national essence.

Cannibalism! Cannibalism! There are many patterns, and the motives are different. Some people eat people, and some people are willing to be eaten. The knights in "Han Feizi" even treat guests with their own flesh, which is even more of a heroic act.

Someday, when I have time, I will write a detailed article on the topic of "cannibalism," but for now, let's leave it at that.
